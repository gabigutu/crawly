		<shortDescription>Come-on People it's a Statham movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What I really dislike about some reviews is that the reviewer wants a "Gone With the Wind" epic blockbuster movie but goes to see a movie that never promises to be one. This is an escapist movie, there are going to be times that one needs to suspend belief. There are going to be holes in the script (or perceived ones if you don't pay attention; the script is the type where one needs to pay attention AND remember things). Sometimes the special effects may not be as realistic as one hopes (remember this is a movie not an documentary),but the editing is tight The stunts can be crazy; for example he jumps upon on top of a hang glider early on (it's telegraphed a couple of minutes prior to it happening so this is not much of a "spoiler").If you want an full-on action movie in which Statham "resurrects" (get it?) his mechanic role you'll like the show, but if you want to see a tight great script with nuance maybe you should just stay home.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great for Statham movie lovers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a Jason Statham movie. There all going to have wild antics and unbelievable action. I love his movies. Don't see this if your not an action fan. Unfortunately the script is a bit foretold in some placesbut the action is extreme and very full. You don't have to worry about a plot. The scripting isn't an award winner but Statham is a true action actor. The real performer is Jessica Alba. Beautiful and sexy as always. The story maybe a little bit slow it does take a moment to get the jest. but in some areas it starts pretty much immediately. It takes a while for him to get the assassinations figured out, If you liked Jason in any of his other rolls, you'll enjoy this. Great cast and great action. This is no drama movie but it does have great action and a touch of love. Have fun and go see this movie. Unless you don't like action. Then go see a Love movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nothing new in story, Action sequence and Pace won't disappoint.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an action flick with one of the most suitable casts Stathom. Script is quite ordinary but the pace, action sequence, and some scenic shots in the movie is what one should go for and they should not be disappointing. Stathom plays his part flawless and so does Jessica in limited role.Adding, I can't expect "A Beautiful mind + Enter The Dragon" in single movie. Either a movie will have strength in script or the theme i.e. action. This movie lacks a powerful script, it is as simple as taking down 3 targets across the globe under the veil of accidents. Right from first minute till the last, pace and action sequence are adroitly set in conjunction. Some beautiful island shots are put at right moment. Jessica Alba was adept exhibiting the chemistry in given scope. Tommy Lee Jones is there but only to give impression of a bad guy not so bad.In all, nothing wrong in watching once and may be twice if action is the generation of your favorite movie lists.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This word seems to lose it's meaning, but ill say it again: Fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is fun! Nothing more than that.Jason Statham is back and though this is not a good movie, it is a fun one and if you expected more than that you have no one else to blame but yourself.Ill rate the movie with my usual ratingssystem which contains rating a few aspect of the movie with an overall total score at the endActing: 5/10. If Jason Statham looking stoically at everyone/everything isn't enough, we got jessica alba being used as a sex symbol first and an actress second. From Jason I can take it since it's his schtick, but jessica... yikes!Action: 7/10. Though there were some cool scenes in there, nothing is original or great by any means. The action in the first the mechanic was better choreographed than in here.Cinematography: 8/10. it is actually well shot and the action that is there is greatly shot with some wide angles here and there. Dialogue: 3/10. I think they didn't even make a screenplay/script. they just went for it and came out with this. Overall: 5/10. Wouldn't recommend it. It is fun and if there's nothing else in the cinemas i would recommend it while you were drunk and paid the matinée price :)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am gonna give my 100% review on this excellent movie. First off, at the beginning of the movie where he starts out in a boat was in my opinion the most awesomeness start off in such a excellent film. When the main character Jason Statham or Arthur Bishop flees to an island in Brazil was the most shocking/beautiful place ever. I loved how when the camera zooms all the way out and you get an view of the palm trees, the beaches, and the most stunning blue water.I was so glued to this movie that I forgot to eat all of my popcorn and that is unusual for me because I run out of popcorn when the trailers are done playing. I would 100% recommend this movie to friends &amp; family.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Non stop action</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The action was non-stop so that part of the movie was great. Good effects. Jason did a good job, as always. Now there is Jessica Alba. She is a pretty girl who looks good in a bathing suit but is also one of the worst actresses out there.Jessica complained that her role made her look too dumb so they changed her back story to say that she was former Special Ops to make her seem smarter. Not only was this a slap in the face to every female Special Ops soldier out there, but she still came off as dumb. I have seen junior high school plays with better acting.She has to show emotion and cry at one point and it was laughable how bad she was. She should stick to running her company and raising her children. Save the acting for a real actress. Emily Blunt would have been an awesome choice in this role.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Statham Franchise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw "The Mechanic", starring Jason Statham-The Expendables movies, Snatch; Jessica Alba-The Sin City movies, Dark Angel_tv; Michelle Yeoh- Babylon A.D., Tomorrow Never Dies; Sam Hazeldine-The Huntsman:Winter's War and Tommy Lee Jones-Jason Bourne, Under Siege.This is a sequel to the 2011 reboot. If you recall, Jason-the assassin that kills people and makes it look like an accident-was presumed dead at the end of the 2011 movie, in a fiery explosion at a gas pump. This one starts off with Sam discovering that Jason survived and wants to use his services to take out 3 business rivals that are have heavy security. Jason politely declines the offer saying that he has retired-and when I said politely, I was being sarcastic. Sam then blackmails Jessica into trying to seduce Jason into doing the hits but real sparks fly between Jessica and Jason so Sam decides to kidnap Jessica and tell Jason he will kill her if he doesn't comply with his wishes. Michelle is a friend of Jason's that helps him when he is laying low and Tommy Lee plays one of the 3 hits Sam wants Jason to take care of. The movie has some incredible stunts and lots of good fights and gun battles. Jessica looks good-Duh! There are lots of exotic locations as Jason travels the world on his endeavors to rid the world of bad guys and the ending is a perfect set up for another sequel, if the box office is any good on this one-and I'm sure it will be. It's rated "R" for violence, language and some sexual content-no nudity- and has a running time of 1 hour &amp; 39 minutes. I really liked it and would buy it on Blu-Ray.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The content is too non logical, Jason has no reason to scarify his life for a 2 days met girl.For short, this film is only for watching some action scenes. But even with the action scene, it is a little bit affected when Jason kills everyone without any considerable antagonistic. The role of the woman in this film is also funny, she has no reason to come to his life :D I am a fan of Jason, but frankly, I am disappointed of this film.I only rate it with 4/10.Regards,</fullReview>

		<fullReview>THE MECHANIC (2016) **1/2 Jason Statham, Jessica Alba, Tommy Lee Jones, Michelle Yeoh, Sam Hazeldine. Fare-to-decent sequel to the remake of the Charles Bronson classic with Statham reprising his in-hiding ex-assassin Arthur Bishop who finds himself pulled in by an old friend (Hazeldine) to off three more men in exchange for the safety of recent flame (nubile Alba) with the usual shenanigans. What works is the fast pacing and clever set-ups concocted by director Dennis Gansel and Philip Shelby &amp; Tony Mosher's screenplay (um, not so much for the leaden dialogue). And it doesn't hurt to have gorgeous locations globetrotting namely in Thailand's paradise. Meanwhile Jones is a hoot suggesting Elton John in his later years as a mark turned comrade. Bonebreaking bliss.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Statham Shooting &amp; Beating People Up Again? Count Me In !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With a movie like Mechanic: Resurrection, you won't expect Oscar worthy acting or dialogue and it certainly isn't going to reinvent the action genre or an established formula.This unexpected sequel, is another decent entry into Stathams filmography and further cements him as one of the top action stars of this generation. Plenty of bad guys get wasted in a number of ways by Statham, which is always entertaining. So for fans looking for there action fix, don't look far as this movie racks up a healthy body count. Although the film met expectations, I felt the overuse of CGI in some action sequences instead of more practical, stunt driven action brought it down a notch. I also felt the original 2011 remake was a more lean, fast paced action movie that managed to pack more solid R-rated action. Ben Fosters performance and his chemistry with Statham added more to the film and story whereas the sequel may have a great cast on paper, the supporting roles and characters they play are either forgettable or little used. Overall, if you want some Statham fueled action, you can't go wrong with this movie on a Tuesday show or a lazy night in. And although it could be a sequel to several of his films, as the saying goes "If it ain't broke, don't fix it". 6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jason Statham Delivers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jason Statham is much better than "Mechanic: Resurrection". Statham returns as retired master assassin Arthur Bishop, who is forced back into the game. In the opening 10 minutes of the movie set in spectacular Rio de Janeiro, Statham dispatches 6 skilled killers using mixtures of muay thai, jujitsu, aikido, boxing and more. He executes his powerful kicks, punches, and locks with grace, fury, and immaculate precision. Yes, this has the spectacle of an Olympic event? apparently timing is everything. Unfortunately, the screenplay by Phillip Shelby and Tony Mosher is absolutely silly, and displays little of those Statham fighting qualities. The written material is feeble; going for complicated instead of simple is a critical mistake. Statham is the best martial artist in movies, and a commanding actor. Director Dennis Gansel squanders the opportunity to leverage Statham in a compelling fashion. Gansel does provide breathtaking scenic views of Thailand, Rio, and Australia. Really that is all just pretty window dressing for an inept story. "Mechanic: Resurrection" also virtually wastes Michelle Yeoh, who is a great martial artist as well, and a charismatic actress. She plays Bishop's former lover Mei. You have Statham and Yeoh in the same movie, and don't capitalize on this? Jessica Alba as Gina is the contrived love interest in peril. She is beautiful, but is handcuffed by the ridiculous script. She is not strong enough of an actress to overcome these odds. Tommy Lee Jones as flamboyant arms dealer Max Adams is the exciting foil for Statham. Admittedly, I had read the movie reviews, and expected a stupid story. So I watched the movie to see Statham kick some ass. That fulfilled expectations. However, sometimes the movie itself distracted from the electrifying Statham fight scenes. Also Statham's nemesis Crain played by Sam Hazeldine, is not a formidable force for Statham. I enjoyed the movie, and it could have been a lot better. Jason Statham also deserves a lot better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>There was a movie in the 1900s or something . . .</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>. . . with Demi Moore's father Dudley called ARTHUR. Jason Statham plays "Arthur Bishop" in MECHANIC: RESURRECTION. This begs the question: WHICH "Arthur" is more like Secret Agent 007--Bishop, or the earlier Art? I think that the first Art held his liquor better than this year's, which is an essential element of being Double Oh Seven. Art of the 1900s also was more observant toward the Rules of the British Realm. He'd never think of missing anything REALLY important to Queen and Country, such as Tea Time. On the other hand, Mr. Statham's Arthur is a prolific killer of dozens, as well as being a master at blowing things up. He also seems to attract a better class of women than the Older Art: Jessica Alba could practically pass for a Bond Girl (and I seem to remember that Michelle Yeoh actually WAS one). With Art the Younger hanging out near the James Bond Island in Thailand, when he's not off on side trips to Rio, Malaysia, Australia, and Bulgaria, it's pretty much of a toss-up as to which Art makes a Better Bond.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Distorted Arthur Bishop. just a Statham movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>German film maker Dennis Gansel takes over from Simon West (Con Air, Expendables 2) filming the sequel to a remake, The Mechanic. Jason Statham returns as Arthur Bishop with that awful husky voice. Yes, it's a London accent and not the pretend American one, but it grates on me. What makes it worse is that the bad guy pulling the strings (Sam Hazeldine) is also an East End orphan with the same husky voice which actually gives the film an English dubbed feel.&nbsp;It's a step backwards story wise as the original plot was actually quite good. Just lacking some John Woo emotional turmoil as the basis of the first was very much the relationship battlefield. This one just becomes a mess, like the studios were just looking for any reason to bring Bishop out of hiding.&nbsp;It doesn't make sense character wise, but I could be wrong. I thought Bishop, especially the Bronson original was a cold-hearted assassin, a loner and would kill his own friend, which they both did. So, Statham falling in love with Alba whilst knowing it's just a ploy to get him to knock off a few major arms dealers just doesn't make any sense.&nbsp;I think the studios must have listened to Statham fans, like myself, with regards to fight scenes. As this is certainly was an improvement on the first, knowing Statham's martial arts capabilities. The film opens well with a good choreographed punch-up and whilst going a little classic James Bond cheesy I was hoping the film was going to carry on like it. But no, instead, Bishop goes agent 47 with MacGyver style precision. The final fight wasn't so bad but everything else in the middle was just mediocre.&nbsp;It's bad acting all round, Jessica Alba was not convincing at all, and though she flaunts off her body, it's the usual Alba we all know. I have no idea what Malaysian super-star Michelle Yeoh was doing there, though, not actually a trained martial artist she is incredibly talented, yet she did little else apart from provide a story anchor. I'm use to seeing Tommy Lee Jones pop up for these smaller, out of character roles, but surely it would have made more sense to sack both Jones and Yeoh, getting smaller stars for the smaller roles and get a badder bad guy. Hell, Jones could have done it!&nbsp;I think where it attempted to be clever just made it dumber, unrealistic and clichéd. It was borderline spoof comedy with the amount of passports, safe houses and secret caches Bishop had. I was actually hoping for a double cross like the first but no, just Bishop being sneaky again. Even from the poster, I just see Sam Fisher from Splinter Cell.&nbsp;I'm a Statham fan and I tried my best to not take this too seriously, but unfortunately I don't think anyone behind the movie took it seriously either which is a shame as the Bishop character, like The Jackal, is a great character.Running Time:&nbsp;5 The Cast:&nbsp;4 Performance:&nbsp;4 Direction:&nbsp;5 Story:&nbsp;2 Script:&nbsp;2 Creativity:&nbsp;4 Soundtrack:&nbsp;3 Job Description:&nbsp;1 The Extra Bonus Point:&nbsp;030% 3/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Solid Action Packed But Easily Forgotten</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Never though that Statham will perform as Bishop again after The Mechanic in 2011 (that was a disappointment). The reason that i wanna see this sequel is the cast. Is not just Statham alone but along with Tommy Lee Jones (Academy Award winner), Jessica Alba and international martial actress from Malaysia - Michelle Yeoh. The story begins with Bishop that begin to enjoy his retirement - tired and sick of all the murderers he planned but then a beautiful Thai girl approached him and offering 3 jobs or get killed. but off course Bishop easily handled this girl and the thugs she bring along with her through a brutal hand combat and escape.Then Bishop move far away to Thailand and warmly welcomed by his old friend - Mei (Michelle Yeoh).Then soon Bishop reluctantly have to save an attractive girl - Gina (Jessica Alba) whom being beaten by a guy named Frank - just to find out that all was just a set up to spying on him. But, Bishop got another plan, since he already know who behind all this, he intend to finish this once and for all. Then Bishop meet Crain, a man who hold his grudge upon Bishop for so long - but want Bishop to do 3 hard tasks - murder high profiles villains - but with his expertise - the killing must look like accident.Bishop easily finished his 2 first tasks - but then he realized that Crain got something behind this all schemes. So,he decide to collaborate with the 3rd target - Max Adams (Tommy Lee Jones), the most powerful gun dealers in all Europea Continent.Again, that this sequel still far from my expectation. I was hope that this sequel will bring more escalation on every aspect, the characters, the conflicts, character development. But, turn out to be only 2 element added to this sequel 1)Bishop's love story and 2)action package.I do really like some "humour" elements inserted but still not enough to make me Laugh Out Loud. Also i was really keen when Bishop finally find out that Gina reluctantly "working" for Crain, but then just so easily Bishop finally fall in love with Gina. A person like Bishop. I really enjoy when Bishop create the accident to kill Cook. And that was really original idea (at least from where i belong). But the funny thing is : the terms of the assignment was the killing must 100% look like accident or Crain will kill Gina. The 1st task was done not really look like accident. The other thing, i always enjoy Tommy Lee Jones perform as Max Adams. His performance reminds me of his perform in Under Siege...eccentric but i can feel the vicious behind it. But then, that just it..this sequel didn't give enough space to develop Max's character.Guess, The Mechanic Resurrcetion is just another typical action movie will be soon forgotten as you put your feet into your doorstep or maybe soon as you leave the building.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>For an action movie, it was too cheesy for me.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first half of the movie is like an Indian film full of romance added with a silhouette sex scene. You can see Statham being Statham on any other films and a premise so 80's that your dad might like it. He is in a nice place minding his own business when all of a sudden he is chased to get a "job" done. He got angry then ran for his life. He fell in love with a one night stand and gave his love interest a nice watch. For the grand finale, I was extremely disappointed on how it abruptly ended. Literally everyone in the cinema were like..."that's it?" and walked out of the door with disbelief. A waste of time unless you have nothing else to watch. 2 stars because it is Jessica Alba. 1 star for some action scenes. That's it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all please excuse for the bad English. The movie plot is not at all great , very ordinary plot. We can easily get to know the story , no suspense , no story , unrealistic fight scenes. Plot is very simple, Statham has to kill 3 people just to save his lover who was kidnapped. He frames the killings as accidents.Overall its an average move, can watch once if you do not have any movies in the cinemas. There is no big role for heroin as well.Jessica Alba looks simple and beautiful.What I like ? The second killing which involves swimming pool on top of a building is really good.Few fighting are actually not realistic but we cannot expect everything to be practical in movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jason and His Adversaries</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So many allusions to the James Bond franchise occur in German director Dennis Gansel's explosive, slam-bang, actioneer "Mechanic: Resurrection," that you wonder if brawny Jason Statham wasn't auditioning for the coveted role of Agent 007. Five years ago, Statham inherited the role of hired assassin Arthur Bishop from the late Charles Bronson in "The Mechanic" (1972), and Statham displayed more than enough gritty aplomb and compelling charisma to make you believe he could play Ian Fleming's British spy. Gansel's sequel to Simon West's "The Mechanic" (2011) boasts all the elements typically seen in a tense Bond thriller: exotic international locales, Adrenalin-laced action sequences set variously on land, sea, ship, and double-digit body count. Statham eludes a murderous, gun-toting dame in Rio de Janeiro by catching a ride on the roof of a cable car to scenic Sugarloaf Mountain. This scene evoked memories of "Moonraker" (1979) where Roger Moore's James Bond swapped blows with Richard Kiel's hulking Jaws atop a cable car. Later, Statham collaborates with a global arms merchant played by Tommy Lee Jones who owns at least two submarines armed with lethal weapons like the villain in "The Spy Who Loved Me." Finally, in a scene after he hooks up with the bodacious Jessica Alba, a hard-bodied Jason Statham emerges from the surf looking like Daniel Craig in his first 007 outing "Casino Royale." Mind you, "Mechanic: Resurrection" is no more a James Bond epic than it is a Tom Cruise "Mission: Impossible" extravaganza. Nevertheless, Statham performs stunts like either Bond or Ethan Hunt might and dispatches adversaries right, left, and center without pause. Compared to Simon West's Louisana-lensed "The Mechanic," Gansel's belated sequel surpasses the original in several respects, mostly in the gunplay category. "Mechanic Resurrection" does something crucial that good sequels should; it provides audiences with more information about the characters. Anybody who remembers Jason Statham's first outing as Arthur Bishop in "The Mechanic" knows that Steve McKenna (Ben Foster of "Contraband") tried to blow him to kingdom come at a gas station. Of course, McKenna failed, but he didn't know what had happened until he got himself blown to bits when he tried to cruise off in one of Bishop's prize cars. McKenna sought to kill Bishop because he discovered that Bishop had killed his father Harry McKenna (Donald Sutherland of "The Hunger Games") as part of a contract commissioned by the criminal syndicate that kept Bishop on its payroll. You don't know have to know any of this when you watch "Mechanic: Resurrection," but a little knowledge never hurt anybody. At the end of "The Mechanic," somebody found CCTV footage of Bishop rolling out of the truck before McKenna ignited that incendiary blast. For the record, Bishop never believed Harry had been guilty of what he was accused of doing by his high-level associate, Dean (Tony Goldwyn of "Ghost"), who double-crossed not only Harry but also Bishop. Since this unfortunate mishap, our eponymous assassin has been on the lam. When "Mechanic: Resurrection" opens, Bishop has been hiding out in plain sight in Rio De Janeiro on his yacht for five months under an assumed name: Otto Sanchez. No sooner has Bishop gone to grab a brew at his favorite hang-out than a gal with a gun (Yayaying Rhatha Phongam) and five henchmen confront him. She informs him her boss wants him to ice three rivals, but the killings must appear accidental. Bishop relies on his ingenious ability to improvise, and he escapes from them. Mind you, Bishop literally obliterates this restaurant during a fight with the thugs before clambering atop a Sugarloaf Mountain bound cable car. The thugs storm the cable car and blow holes in the roof, prompting our hero to dive off it and luckily land atop another girl out flying her hang glider for kicks. This opening scene is worthy of either a James Bond or an Ethan Hunt. Once he has eluded these pugnacious ruffians, Bishop travels to a remote collection of islands off the coast of Thailand. He goes back to see an old friend, Mei (Michelle Yeoh of "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"), and learns that a former friend requires his unique services. Along the way, Mei encounters a bruised and battered damsel-in-distress, Gina (Jessica Alba of "The Fantastic Four"), who has been roughed up by her cruel boyfriend. Mei persuades Bishop to intervene on Gina's behalf, but Bishop inadvertently kills the boyfriend, Frank (Anteo Quintavalle of "Hard Target 2"), after he boards the boat where the couple are quarreling. Initially, Bishop doesn't trust Gina. She confesses that she has been forced to seduce him because a ruthless criminal without a shred of morality, Riah Crain (Sam Hazeldine of "The Brothers Grimsby"), has terrorized the co-workers at a school that she runs in Cambodia for children victimized by the sex trade. Bishop shares with Gina that he was an orphan himself who was sold into slavery to an East End London mobster and trained to be a kid soldier. Bishop, it seems, escaped from the mobster, but his childhood pal Riah wasn't fortunate enough. Riah was punished for his part in Bishop's breakout, and Rian yearns for payback. He abducts Gina and bargains to release her if Bishop will kill three unsavory gents. Clearly, "Survivor" scenarist Philip Shelby and freshman co-scripter Tony Mosher have written a thoroughly convoluted thriller. The twists and turns make their screenplay look like a pretzel. The dialogue doesn't contain a quotable line, and most of the Rio de Janeiro CGI work looks mediocre. Nevertheless, "We Are the Night" director Dennis Gansel doesn't let this nonsense loiter during its nimble, white-knuckled 99 minutes. Gansel stages some daredevil fistfights and firefights that compensate for its contrived screenplay. The skyscraper swimming pool scene 76 floors up is breathtaking. Sadly, Michelle Yeoh and Tommy Lee Jones languish in supporting roles with little to distinguish themselves, while Statham tangles with inexhaustible adversaries. If you enjoy watching Jason Statham kick ass, "Mechanic: Resurrection" is an ideal diversion.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>2011's The Mechanic was not a typical fun Jason Statham adventure. A remake of the 1972 Charles Bronson film of the same name, it was an ugly movie about ugly people, but it was interesting and had good performances. If nothing else, it captured a little bit of the gritty spirit of a Charles Bronson picture from the 1970s. This loose sequel, appropriately titled Mechanic: Resurrection, is much more in line with the Charles Bronson films of the 1980s: dumb, fast-paced, occasionally cheesy, and full of an abundance of gunfire and explosions. It's a tonally different film altogether from its predecessor, and it's all the better for it. In fact, it's Jason Statham's most entertaining movie in years.Mechanic: Resurrection isn't necessarily tongue-in-cheek. There aren't one-liners being tossed around, there's no true comic relief, and there's no commentary on the extremely by-the-numbers plot of the film. That said, it's highly doubtful the filmmakers expect the audience to take much, or any of this seriously. This film may hold the record for the most number of boat explosions in a motion picture. When boats aren't getting blown up, bad guys are. There's one shot involving a bad guy, a grenade, and a Jacuzzi that's so over-the-top and absurd that I laughed out loud at the ridiculousness of it. The body count is easily close to a 100, if not higher. Just when plot holes seem to pop up, there's another big action scene to take one's attention away from it all. This may not have a huge budget like the other action extravaganzas released this summer, but it makes up for its low budget with pure adrenaline and enjoyably bombastic tendencies.Reprising his role as Arthur Bishop, Jason Statham once again proves himself to be the most underrated action star working today. He gets to smile way more here than he got to in The Mechanic, but he still feels like the same character, albeit not quite as tortured about his dark nature. It's a credit to Statham's endless charisma that the audience is able to side with his somewhat immoral character at all. As Statham's love interest, Jessica Alba doesn't have much to do, and she unfortunately only gets to do a tiny bit of fighting, although she brings more to the part than some other actresses could. Her part could have been stronger, and with the 94-minute running time, it's possible parts of her performance got left on the cutting room floor. It also appears Tommy Lee Jones may have had a bit more to do at some point, as he's all over the trailers and TV spots, yet his role here is little more than a cameo. Still, Jones is fun to watch here, sporting a soul patch and a laid back attitude for once.I'm not going to argue that Mechanic: Resurrection is a highlight of the action genre, but it is one of the few bright spots of the summer movie season, especially considering I had low expectations. As a sequel to a so-so remake, Mechanic: Resurrection could have been an outright disaster. The fact that it's as enjoyable as it is, and taking into account that it had lot of rumored reshoots, it's a minor miracle the film turned out the way it did. Though it's unlikely to turn a profit given its big summer competition, I would heartily embrace a third Mechanic installment in the near future. 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched the movie on the day of release. I was not expecting much but some actions and even the story is really nice. Only the part where viewers may feel bore is during long conversation in Jail, but beside that everything is good. The only weakest part of the script is the quick falling in love of the two actors and how the Jaison does all to rescue. Some of the actions which they display on the trailer is the main highlights of the movie. Some of the actions may have never been shown in any movies before. Such as the making hole on the top floor swimming pool is the best part of the movie which is less excited as its all over poster and trailer but its the main part.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>&#x2605;&#x2605; - another unnecessary sequel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Everyone loves a good Statham movie, but when they're bad they're terrible. The trouble with Mechanic: Resurrection is that he never really looked in any danger, at no point do you think he could lose. Although that's pretty cool, it sucks the tension away.Shelby and Mosher's screenplay doesn't help matters either. Some of the dialogue is way too cheesy, and there are tons of plot points that make no sense, which takes you out of the movie to ask yourself "why would they do that?". The action sequences are pretty intense to watch, but the fast paced editing and shaky close-ups make the fights pretty unintelligible. Worse than all that, though, is the hilarious animation. Clearly they did that bit last once the budget had all but dried up, leaving us with tacky, dated CGI that would look more at home on a PlayStation 2 game.On to the characters - Statham is Statham, he does the same thing in everything and you either like him or don't. The real tragedy is Alba. She tries to have depth, but she's just there for one reason - a beautiful woman that Statham can fall unconvincingly in love with after a few hours. Hazeldine, as Statham's nemesis, is all over the place. He tries to match his voice and mannerisms, but completely fails and feels massively underwritten, whereas Jones (as good as he always is) is just there to pick up the cheque.Mechanic: Resurrection is pretty light and daft, but has no substance or uniqueness. It's yet another franchise that really didn't need a sequel.2/5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bad Movie - Good Laugh</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So, going into this movie, i was expecting a dumb action movie, but in hindsight, i was expecting "someone who has trouble reading" dumb, not "someone who is utterly lost without supervision" dumb.To be clear, this movie is so cookie cutter bad that viewing it seriously will just make you sad. but the movie is great to watch with a few friends and riff on.The whole plot is just so bland and far fetched, actions are sometimes so illogical and the movie doesn't even follow it's own rules (for instance, from the trailer we learn he has to assassinate a few people and make it look like an accident. yet one kill is very very clearly not an accident)The CGI is so bad, i'm not sure if Worldwide FX is that bad of a studio or if they had to work with a very very limited budget, maybe both.On a special note, The romance scene between JS&amp;JA is really vulgar, as in, you feel uncomfortable watching and feel almost guilty.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Revenge is sweet</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is my review of Mechanic: Resurrection (spoiler free)*** (3/5)Cast: Jason Statham, Jessica Alba, Tommy Lee-Jones, Michelle YeohPlot: Arthur Bishop (Statham) thought he had put his murderous past behind him when his most formidable foe kidnaps the love of his life (Alba). Now he is forced to travel the globe to complete three impossible assassinations, and do what he does best, make them look like accidents.A lot of people say that whenever Statham is in a new movie the only person he can play is himself, but maybe that isn't so much a bad thing. The world's most athletic assassin is back with more action and more heart stopping stunts than ever okay not than ever because there has only been one Mechanic. The first Mechanic (2011) saw Bishop kill quite a few people so you may be thinking what's the difference between the movies? Well this has been done on a much larger scale especially when in one scene you see him dangling from the bottom of transparent pool almost fifty stories up a building, to kill one unfortunate McGuffin. This is technically called Mechanic 2 but the only reason why it is called Resurrection is because Bishop has been resurrected from the dead. This sounds very familiar to another movie done before this well there is, Crank (2006) which saw Chev (also Statham) fall from a helicopter 14,000 feet in the air and then he comes back for revenge in Crank: High Voltage (2009). But don't blame Statham for wanting to do a sequel of the Mechanic because that ended on such a cliff-hanger. This is a pretty good continuation from the first film he goes out in search of revenge and he does it with such grace and formality, well the grace being death defying jumps and the formality being they look like accidents. This shows to be a fit for Statham though especially considering it's the first time working with German director Dennis Gansel, but again it's done well or moderately well. Unfortunately the script is a bit wobbly in some places and the other actors don't have a sense of tone in voice but sometimes if the action is good and fast-paced you don't have to worry about the scripting, unless in Gods of Egypt's (2016) case when it doesn't have a plot. But because of the wobbly scripting it turns out that the performances aren't particularly great either, although Statham tries to the best of his abilities but the real performer is the action, the stunts and the bullets, also the story is a little bit flat it does take a while for the action to get started, although in some areas it starts pretty much immediately but it takes a while for him to get the assassinations sorted, and finally when it gets to them they are too quick to end not necessarily a bad thing. Of course just like in the first one Bishop is very clever especially when he uses surveillance to scope out the people he wants to kill, but that's another story he is clever in the way he devises his plans to end people's lives mainly his enemies, and also the use of explosives which is the key element to this movie but then that is the key element to action movies, well some actioners. There is a way this film is done better this is kind of like the first one as well everywhere Bishop goes it is absolutely stunning with the gorgeous landscapes and the beautiful women, but he doesn't go there for women, he's not James Bond. Sometimes whenever Bishop plans his kills it doesn't always go well like last time when one of his targets killed him, but ignore that. There are several Heart stopping stunts in this blood filled actioner, the main stunt let's call it a jump happens very early on when he is in Rio de Janeiro and he jumps straight down from a cargo lift to a hand glider in the air, that stunt will literally stop your heart but not everything in this movie is stunts there is also quite a unique story to it a bit flat but it's there. Character development as this the second in the series we already know what there is about Arthur Bishop, but what about the other characters? Do we learn about them? Well not really, not much anyway there is a little bit to learn about the characters especially one of the targets, which strangely enough Tommy Lee-Jones' Max Adams in his most ridiculous outfit yet, but also he doesn't say much which again is weird because in most of his movies he's quite the talker.Now finally the one thing that is missing for all you Statham fans there is no martial arts, whenever Statham stars in a new film there is loads of martial arts spectacles to behold but unfortunately that is the one thing that is missing but don't let that disappoint you there is still plenty of blood filled, guns blazing action to peel your eyes at. So don't get too upset about the martial arts being missing. In conclusion this is an enjoyable action packed ride with plenty of blood guns and beautiful women, and even Statham's gruff demeanor is something to enjoy weirdly enough. Even though Statham has done some disastrous disappointments this surely isn't one. Certainly not as manic as the Crank series but still fun and enjoyable and probably one of the best ever Statham actioners.Verdict: Statham delivers to the best of his abilities in this long-awaited sequel which feels very familiar but it's an enjoyable actioner nonetheless.6/10 action packed gold.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is a product, not a movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went to a Sneak Preview where nobody got to hear what movie we were going to watch. I was hoping they put on the new Woody Allen movie or Hell or High Water, which looks very promising. When I saw Jason Statham his name on the screen I realized which movies I was going to watch.The trailers didn't interest me at all, so I was skeptical prior to watching this flick. This is one of the most generic films I have seen in a long time. There are many problems and just a few things that are actually "good" about this.Characters: As many filmmakers know, characters are key for moving the plot. The only person who moves this plot is the antagonist, who's name I have already forgotten. Jason Statham and Jessica Alba are not very good leads in this. They have done some promising things in the past, Statham did great in Snatch and Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, Jessica Alba was pretty good in that time she appeared in The Office and she was promising in Dark Angel, which I gave up on quite quickly. The actors are not the ones to blame though, the writers and the director are. Character development is barely in this movie and none of the characters except for Tommy Lee Jones are interesting or intriguing in any way. Now I know there are people out there who think characters do not matter in an action flick like this, but I think it does. Go ahead and look up an action scene from a summer movie that you haven't seen yet. Pretty unexciting right? That's because you don't know and don't care about the interaction of the characters in that scene, and that was one of the biggest problems in this entire movie. Everyone is bland and forgettable. Plot: It's like I was watching Killer Elite, from 2011. The story is exactly the same with the same lead actor: -A hit-man who makes his kills look like accidents stars in both movies -A loved one is captured -The antagonist tells the protagonist to kill three targets and the loved one will liveThat's how generic this is: it's been done exactly the same years ago. Action: Action gets bland and boring quick. It's uncreative and uninspiring, there is nothing original, cool or crazy about it. There is not much to say about it, except that you can find this action in any summer action movie.Now why did I rate it three stars instead of one? Well, the skyscraper scene was entertaining for a minute and Tommy Lee Jones's character was the best character in this film, every time he was on screen the film felt much better. And that's not because Tommy Lee Jones is a good actor, it's because this character had a personality unlike the rest of the cast.Don't waste your money as this is another pathetic attempt of Hollywood trying to earn a few more dollars. Go watch Killer Elite if the plot sounds interesting or if you want to go to the cinema go watch something that isn't this. I'll do you a favor.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Don't get me wrong - I like Jason Statham, and I know exactly what to expect from his films, and that's exactly what I got here. But there were two elements (aside from the utter predictability and complete lack of any surprises) which annoyed me.One was Jessica Alba's complete lack of screen presence. She's usually at least cute to look at - here she was drab and ordinary as well as unable to act. Awful.And the second was the fact that, for much of the second half, I might as well have been watching a shoot-'em-up computer game as Statham engaged in a linear progression taking out hordes of unnamed black-clad target-fodder in endless combat scenes which carried no suspense at all, because there was never any sense that Statham was in jeopardy no matter how many men came at him, Disappointing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Action was good, but mediocre overall, even by Statham's standards</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jason Statham films are a guilty pleasure of mine. He plays practically the same character in every one of his films and the plots (what little there are) are usually interchangeable. That being said, the action is usually good and they films don't outstay their welcome.Which is why I was disappointed with this film. It started so well, with a great action scene to kick things off, then it crashes to an abrupt halt.Whoever was in charge of pacing for this film needs a talking to, as the island scene with Jessica Alba was so long and drawn out that I nearly considered leaving, and this is only a ninety-minute film!After that some stuff happened which advanced the 'plot' (which was weak, as expected). I think they missed opportunities to add some plot twists with Alba's character, as she could have actually been the bad guy (which would have been awesome) and instead went for the expected path.It seems mean to pick holes in the story (it feels like criticising a dyslexic's spelling), but the whole point of getting Statham's character (the Mechanic), to do the kills was to make them look like accidents (presumably so that the other targets didn't realise they were being targeted), but the third target (Tommy Lee Jones' character) immediately knew that Crain (the bad guy) was going after them, kinda rendering using the Mechanic a moot point.Anyway, the action scenes were good, but not enough to raise up this very mediocre film. For a better example of a decent Statham film, watch Safe.(Originally published on my blog, whingewood.wordpress.com)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Despite occasional fleeting enjoyment and the potential to be 'so-bad-its-good' for some people, this is a bad film that's not only generic and stupid but also boring as well.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Mechanic: Resurrection' is the latest cinematic snooze featuring the never charismatic Jason Statham, sequel to the incomprehensible montage that was 2011's 'The Mechanic' ? a film featuring less action than 'Sleepless In Seattle.' Is it better than the first one? Well, yes it is but that doesn't mean it's good. It is so generic and clichéd that it not only seems as though the writers ticked off every action movie trope in the book, but then proceeded to viciously beat the audience over the head with it. Seriously, I wanted this to be a fun time but it really wasn't. Sure, there was some limited enjoyment but the majority of the film was just plain dull. As I said, the worst crime this movie commits is simply being boring. By the time it gets going you're already checked out, so anything that happens seems even less interesting. The plot - if you can call it that - is hackneyed, hokey and honestly absurd. The first act crawled along at a snail's pace - feeling as though it lasted for ages - and, once the film does settle into itself, it plays out like a poor excuse for a video-game. Statham receives a new objective accompanied by some very expositional (and often impossible, in a 'when was he told this?' kind of way) narration, does the task incredibly easily and then rinses and repeats. This repetition really hurts the proceedings, as nothing is unpredictable and it all feels too familiar. The best parts of the flick involve the eponymous 'mechanic' planning and executing these missions, but all of them come across as a walk in the park despite us being told they are quite the opposite. A lot of the plans rely too much on coincidence and contrivances to be convincing, with a lot of what happens being laughably trite and candidly stupid. On top of that, scenes exist for no real reason and often feel very inconsequential. There is occasional enjoyment if you are prepared to revel in the general silliness of it all, and some people may find it 'so-bad- its-good' ? a woman in my screening was consistently laughing at the more outlandish moments.The acting, or lack thereof, is some of the worst I've seen all year. Jessica Alba is more wooden than a pirate's false leg and Tommy Lee Jones has 'pay-check' written across his forehead in bold letters. Statham himself isn't bad when he isn't speaking, he is convincing physically and comes across well in the action scenes, but every time he opened his mouth I just wanted to yawn. To be fair, that probably isn't his fault this time as he has to deliver some honestly awful dialogue in one of the year's worst screenplays. He isn't inherently bad, I've seen him give better performances, but he has little to work with and almost nothing to do. Some lines were downright cringe- worthy whilst others were either boring or genuinely annoying; the characters were seriously under-cooked and two dimensional as well. We get the typical mundane 'British bad guy', the generic mean main-henchman, the overdone 'retired assassin brought back into the game' premise and the monotonous kidnapping/ black-mail combo commonly seen as an excuse for a belated sequel. There's not a lot to like in the script, even the (hopefully) purposely cheesy one-liners lack in impact. I didn't once get a sense of self-awareness or satire, even if the filmmakers may try to retroactively convince us that was the intention, and thus didn't feel any joy at any point; I never once smiled, but I constantly wanted to face-palm.Technically, the film is mainly competent despite some jittery and occasionally muddy cinematography. The action sequences aren't egregious, but they lack any real impact and cut frequently at odd moments; there is also some obvious speed-ramping, noticeably artificial camera tricks and several skipped frames. The hand-to- hand is where this is most apparent, with the longer scenes feeling a little tiresome and technically unsound. The shorter moments of close combat work well, especially when mixed with the surprisingly efficient gun-play ? which looks decent most of the time and is framed a lot better than the fisticuffs. A lot of lead is slung, and a lot of people provide ample targets for it, but ultimately the shooting lacks any real impact as wave after wave of speechless meat-bags pile on-top of one another in a hilariously inept fashion. There is occasional and fleeting enjoyment though, especially when the focus is firmly on the excessive action. The CGI here is really poor, with every explosion either an obvious piece of stock-footage or a mid-2000s level 'fume' particle effect. In either case, they are poorly implemented into the live action with overt wire-work and weak on-set interaction compounding their unbelievable nature. There is some hazy green-screening as well, looking as though someone keyed out the green and then cranked the feather setting up to 100 ? either that, or they slathered the screen with enough Vaseline to completely undermine Ice Cube himself. It may have just been me, but I also noticed some artefacts in a couple of shots: small black cubes and minor pixilation. It feels like the shots in question were unfinished but rushed into the final product anyway. The music is really bad, too, with the theme being incredibly cheesy and sometimes out-of-place.Overall, 'Mechanic: Resurrection' is a bad movie. It is poorly structured, often boring and generally uninspired as well as being blatantly stupid and excessively generic. The dialogue was terrible, the plot was nonsensical, the acting was phoned-in and the CGI stuck out like a poorly-rendered thumb. There was some limited and fleeting enjoyment in the action set-pieces, and some people may like it in a 'so-bad-its-good' kind of way, but I didn't have a good time and wouldn't recommend it: 4/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'MECHANIC: RESURRECTION': Three Stars (Out of Five) Sequel to the 2011 action hit 'THE MECHANIC'; which is a remake of the 1972 flick (of the same name). The film once again stars Jason Statham, as the retired hit-man named Arthur Bishop (played by Charles Bronson in the original 1972 flick). In this installment, he's forced to come out of retirement and kill three criminals; in order to save the woman he loves. It was directed by German filmmaker Dennis Gansel; and it was written by Philip Shelby, Tony Mosher, Brian Pittman and Rachel Long. The film costars Jessica Alba, Sam Hazeldine, Michelle Yeoh and Tommy Lee Jones. It's received mostly negative reviews from critics (of course), but it is meeting the usual Jason Statham B-movie Box Office standards. I thought it was OK.Arthur Bishop (Statham) has been retired, and living under a fake name in Rio de Janeiro, for some time (after faking his death in the last movie); until he's visited by a mysterious woman (Yayaying Rhatha Phongam), and some mercenaries. They want Bishop to do a job for a secret employer. He refuses, and flees to Thailand. There he meets an abused woman named Gina Thorne (Alba). He falls for her, as he learns the mysterious employer wants him to; and when she's kidnapped, he's once again forced to murder three criminals (and stage their deaths as accidents). The movie is extremely clichéd, and horrendously cheesy (at times). It does have some decent actions scenes though, and Jason Statham doing what he does best. The celebrity supporting cast is mainly just there as extended cameos though, and their talents are wasted. I also wasn't impressed by Gansel's directing. The original remake was much better; I actually don't think I've ever seen the original 1972 film (possibly an edited version, on TBS, but I don't remember).Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/lcZBQp0HBZg</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty much what you would expect</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When one goes to see a Jason Statham action film like THE MECHANIC or THE TRANSPORTER, one does not expect an Academy Award winning character study with intricate plotting. One expects that you will see Jason killing bad guys in the vein of 80's Arnold and Stallone films - films that have been called "body count movies".So, when Statham decided to return to his roots and reprise his role in MECHANIC: RESURRECTION, I had my expectations on the right plane.And, this movie met these expectations, for the most part.The plot is simple, Staham's assassin, THE MECHANIC, is forcefully brought out of retirement to assassinate rivals of an arms dealer. These 3 targets are played by two guys I've never seen before and Tommy Lee Jones. Guess which one of the three gets the bigger, juicier part?The plotting, even for this type of movie, is paper thin and the dialogue and character development almost non-existent, which is fine with me, for I wasn't expecting anything good here.So, how was the action? Were the killings interesting/original?Not really. Besides a death involving a hot tub and a hand grenade, there was no real ingenuity in any of the killings and it looked like Statham, as game as he tried, was going through the motions. Early on, he is aided by veterans Michelle Yeoh and Jessica Alba, but that didn't provide any spark to this film. Only when Tommy Lee Jones showed up did this film have any kind of spark - Jones looked like he was having fun playing a character far removed from anything he's played in a long, long time.In the end, this film is entertaining enough, certainly a good Saturday afternoon popcorn flick. Go for Statham doing what Statham does best, stay for Tommy Lee Jones' antics.6 (out 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank (of Marquis)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Mechanic: Resurrection" is the highly anticipated sequel to the 2011 Jason Statham classic...OK, let me just say, the 2011 remake to the 1972 film "The Mechanic" was a decent flick thanks to Simon West's understanding of the action genre, BUT did I think it was worthy of a sequel, let alone one five years later? Absolutely not, but alas, here we are, now to be honest I was actually interested in seeing this film, the trailers made it out to be a fast paced, dumb, straightforward action movie with a classic Tommy Lee Jones villain portrayal, well, I'm here today to tell you that trailer was BULLSHIT, not only is the film boring but the best part of the movie (Tommy Lee Jones) plays such a small, unimportant role in the film, he's just an excuse to prolong such an unenjoyable crap fest, Jessica Alba's only purpose in the film is to be a damsel in distress and get beaten up, its direction and editing is choppy, and the visuals are atrocious, it's an embarrassing film to be rewarded a wide, theatrical release.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Unlike other reviewers, I found it to be a decent movie. The plot makes sense, albeit being a bit thin and moving fast forward without too many details. Essentially he goes from one killing to the next in fairly rapid succession.The scenery is nice with locations in Rio, Sydney and South East Asia. Jessica Alba's character is not really at all relevant and is a hard sell that this is the reason he is bullied into doing the killings. The romantic connection between the two is nil. Tommy Lee Jones portrays a rather odd looking villain - but I guess that's the norm nowadays. Overall an entertaining flick.</fullReview>

Mission to killing the people were seems playing contra in childhood. by the first half only you will loose the charm. talented cast like Tommy lee was just a cameo as well as Jessica Alba and Michelle Yeoh. i am going with 3/10. 3 is just for appearance of the jason statham. go to theater only if you are die hard fan of jason. else you can skip this movie.</fullReview>

You won't get it here as there are too many holes.Some movies I watch just for the action and, in Jason Statham's case, the fight scenes.Jessica Alba is the love interest the bad guy is using to blackmail Statham into doing the jobs he no longer wants to do.Oh, and unlike what another reviewer has written, it's not Tommy Lee Jones who is the bad guy in this.

		<shortDescription>This is really silly - - -</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In true action movie fashion, Jason Statham never runs out of bullets, can get anywhere in the world at warp speed and can consistently take on fifteen men at once and come out on top.But, on the other hand, if you: a) are prepared to leave your brain at the door; b) can go on $5.00 Tuesday; c) like looking at Jessica Alba, then -watching 2 hours of total mayhem can be entertaining sometimes. (The scene with the suspended swimming pool was a gas!) And you can re-awaken your brain on the drive home by trying to figure out whatever possessed Tommy Lee Jones to be in this thing. (Maybe he likes looking at Jessica Alba?)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A guilty pleasure</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I must admit that I have a soft spot for movies made by Millennium Films, since the company is run by several individuals who have ties to Cannon Films - which made wonderfully cheesy yet entertaining B movies in the 1980s. Actually, "Mechanic: Resurrection" is of a higher class than many Cannon Films in some regards. The movie took the expense of filming in several countries around the globe, and has a glossy and expensive look - for the most part. (There is some crummy CGI here and there). There is that cast, for instance - you get Jason Statham, Jessica Alba, Michelle Yeoh, and Tommy Lee Jones all in the same movie. (Though Yeoh and Jones are pretty much wasted.) There is also some high impact action. (Though the fight scenes are often rapidly edited and with the camera close up to the participants, diluting the true impact.)As you can see, the movie has its bad points as well as good points. It's not one of the best action movies made... but neither is it one of the worst. It is for a select audience. But count me as one of those audience members, because I was able to embrace the entire package, warts and all. If you are fond of B action movies, the more chance there is that you'll like this movie. If not, move on and let its chosen audience enjoy a guilty pleasure.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Mechanic" is quite an unsexy title. It conjures images of low-slung jeans, exorbitant MOTs, and overbearing pop radio bellowing out of a sidestreet garage. But it also means "hit-man" in mafia language, and Jason Statham's Arthur Bishop is the best of the best. The 2011 film was a pretty mediocre remake of a Michael Winner/Chuck Bronson vehicle (get it?). To say that this sequel ? whose belated nature is right there in the title ? is an "original" work would be pushing it. Bishop is trying to lead a regular type life on his bomb-rigged yacht when he's dragged into a plot devised by Riah Crain (Sam Hazeldine), an old orphan buddy. They were separated back in hit-man training school ? Bishop got out but Crain turned into a cold- hearted empire-builder. Now Crain wants Bishop to murder his business competitors.Crain needs leverage, so he kidnaps Bishop's girlfriend, Gina (Jessica Alba) ? she'll die unless Bishop completes three contracts. The film almost finds its stride during this trio of setpieces; and indeed the plot on paper is silly and simple enough to be a serviceable carriage for Statham's very specific talents. Naturally the trail of destruction leads Bishop to an explosive showdown with Crain himself. The problem is that Mechanic: Resurrection just isn't a very well written, directed, or edited film. Those are all the fundamental phases of film production without a lick of real quality, and the result is there on the screen, from the cheap opening with its poor superimposing, through its arbitrarily globe-hopping narrative, all the way to its bungled non-event of a final revelation. There's no real characterisation to speak of (explaining convoluted plot elements to each other doesn't count) and the whole enterprise is scuppered by the complete lack of chemistry between Statham and Alba. By the way, she's a rote damsel with an angelic tendency for rescuing foreign kids and a penchant for kicking henchmen in the balls. The action is too slow coming, and messily edited when it does arrive. Retrograde in all departments, I couldn't help thinking of Goldeneye N64 as The Stath stalked guards on the bad guy's boat. (Weirdly, we get two of these sequences and they're virtually identical.) Speaking of video games, the other touchstone is surely the Hit-man franchise. As Bishop goes about his business, never under any real threat, it's like watching a speedrun on YouTube.The violence is of the toned-down, CG blood style that has crept into this increasingly PG-13 action culture. Yet we still get a laughably coy sex scene where the stars do it in clothes. It's not like director Dennis Gansel is shy ? Statham's body is the temple that his camera worships here, far more than Alba's. The first movie had Donald Sutherland to bring gravitas, and here Tommy Lee Jones is thrown into the mix ? albeit very late on and briefly. Laid-back and sporting shades, as though his baddie from Under Siege is all grown up. It's a dead easy pay cheque for Jones but we get precious little of his time. Obviously there are no grey areas here with regard to goodies and baddies. We're not looking for that. But some kind of inventiveness or a narrative curveball wouldn't have gone amiss. Because it's not like we have blistering action to fall back on. There's a scene where Bishop is climbing a skyscraper using sucker pads, and it's so poorly staged and phony; it had me yearning for Ghost Protocol and a proper bit of high-rise stunt work. Resurrection is for Statham completists only. It's worse than its not-great predecessor. A guilty non-pleasure ? think Cobra rather than Commando ? whose rightful place is the small screen, and last on the watchlist.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's a dumb action movie cliché, but it's got Jason Statham in it!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It feels like forever since I've seen Statham head up his own action movie. Once again Statham takes on the role of Bishop, a skilled assassin who niche is his ability to make it look like his marks were killed by accident. "Retired" since the last movie, Bishop is forced back in the biz by a frenemy called Crian.And the clichés begin real quick (Well the movie actually begins with Statham kicking some much needed ass in a boss action sequence using the backdrop of Brazil). Bishop is set up by Crian to fall for a battered woman, played by Jessica Alba, and despite knowing what Crian is up to, purposely pointing out the flaw in this action movie cliché, Bishop falls for it, and now has to work for Crian to get her back when she's kidnapped.Though the Mechanic is suppose to be this real cleaver assassin in his ability to get in and create a death trap for his victims, I have to say, the traps go by too fast to seem cleaver at all, but I did not go to this movie to see Statham be cleaver, I went to see him be bad ass, and he does this in-between missions.It's not the best action sequences I've seen Statham do, not by a long shot. As a matter of fact, the action starts strong and strangely gets weaker as the story goes by. Not to the point where they suck but you will notice the dwindle in quality.Jessica Alba plays perfect eye candy in this film. I'm a little surprise that after such a long time of not acting that she would pick a role like this, but if you only want to see how well Jessica Alba aged (or rather has not) than this is the movie.I'm mostly disappointed that Michelle Yeoh (My personal eye candy) did not do much but stand around as well. I know she's aged (Still looks good), but I would have loved to see her just take on one room full of bad guys using a coconut or something (She plays a beach resort owner who is an old friend of Bishop's), but I guess Statham really needed all the action scenes for himself.There is another star in the film but even though he has a key part as one of the Mechanic's marks his part it too small to be played by someone as big as he.The Mechanic: Resurrection is something you'd expect to go Straight-To-Video (Or whatever the kids called that type of movie these days) ,with it's cliché story arch you see in every action movie ever, and it's simple action parts, but hey, it's Jason Statham! How can anyone resist, right? http://cinemagardens.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another fun, crazy and funny Statham actioner!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie has everything you can expect from a Jason Statham flick. Crazy stunts, laughable action scenes, shootouts, fight scenes.That's all you'll get by watching this movie.Plot is lazy and it never picks up until the 40 min mark. I was really worried about it, but it really gets better once he gets arrested. Really bad CGI ( I'm sure I saw blue spots from bullet holes and red spots on walls coming from bullets ), there's music taken straight from The Dark Knight ( when Alba gets kidnapped, I'm sure I heard that theme in TDK during scenes with Joker ). By the end of the movie, they also get theme from The Equalizer ( scene where Denzel walks away from the explosion ). It's laughable.This movie is meant to be a sequel, but you don't need to watch the first one before watching this one. It's OK on its own.Overall it's a nice way to kill 1 hour and half. Statham kills a lot in this movie. Tommy Lee Jones needed money the mortgage, I assume. He does nothing in this movie ( even though he's one of the main targets that Statham has to kill ). At least he doesn't die!6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Some good action, some bad action and a simple plot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mechanic: Resurrection at times felt like watching someone play a computer game. Unlike the predecessor, the plot in this movie was very bland and lacking in nuance. It was like a series of gates, break into place 1 and defeat boss 1. Break into place 2, defeat boss 2. Obtain clues, break in and defeat boss, repeat.The other reason the movie felt like a computer game was that the CGI was a bit too obvious in a lot of scenes. Fire that spreads perfectly and regularly. Every bullet that hits someone creates a minor fountain of blood (that doesn't seem to hit the ground or soak into their clothes).The movie did start off with what could have been a great action scene, but ended up being so-so. The reason it was only so-so was because it was impossible to see what was going on. Too much jerky camera work and jump cuts made it hard to see. Statham has the chops to do action scenes without making the scene more frenetic with cheap cinematography.One comment I overheard leaving the theater was why cast Jessica Alba. I won't say she did a bad job, but she wasn't particularly compelling either and had little chemistry with Statham, which undermined the motivation for the whole movie. I would also comment that I was very sad that Michelle Yeoh didn't get a more substantive role.Overall, it was a bit disappointing. There was some good action, although it was usually undermined by the camera work. There were a few minutes of wittiness, but overall it's a summer action movie that will be forgotten.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Video Review for Mechanic Resurrection</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is by far the dumbest film I've seen all year long. For action films, this movie ranks as being just as dumb, and cliché as Gods of Egypt. Mechanic is not redeemed by anything. It has terrible acting, shaky cam action, horrible storytelling, cliché, bad CGI, and a horrible ending. I had not expectations when walking into this movie and I walked out hating it. Mechanic wins at being the best comedy of the year rather then a great action film like it was aiming for. Mechanic is a waste of time unless you want to see the dumbest film of the year. Check out my video review for a much more in depth review of the movie.

		<shortDescription>Absolute Rubbish</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mechanic: Resurrection doesn't need to exist in any way shape or form. Let's get that off the bat right away. In fact, The Mechanic (2011) didn't need to exist, yet like washed up ambergris or a second season of Reaper (2007-2009), it just showed up one day. Now we have another one only this time instead of a grizzled revenge story, this second helping of the sordid life of Arthur Bishop (Statham) involves a soapy romance and a brother against brother story so recycled it might as well be compost.Since last we saw him, Bishop has been keeping a low profile living in a modest yacht off the harbor of Rio de Janiero. That is until an old villain named Crain (Hazeldine) tracks him down and asks him to take out three people and make them look like accidents. To up the ante, Crain uses a clichéd do-gooder named Gina (Alba) as a carrot in a plot-line that should have come across calculated but just comes across as silly. With no choice, Bishop's unique set of skills are put to the test, pitting him against some of the most vile humans on the face of the earth.Now let's face it, a movie like this shouldn't exactly be plot- heavy. What anyone can reasonably expect is some close-quarters brawling, kinetic gun-play, massive explosions and kick-butt one- liners all to the tune to a soundtrack of pure bluster. Plus, given the amount of supervillain flunkys dying horrifically and shooting for s**t, it's pretty much a given the script for this film was in a producer's back-drawer somewhere marked "Arnold Schwarzenegger Vehicles".Yet Mechanic: Resurrection tries to be so much smarter than it really is. The intricate planning of each of the protagonists marks demands audience attention, painstakingly creating a collage of premeditation. Yet with each passing moment, it becomes clear that Bishop's meticulousness is less a character detail than a plot device; an excuse to be showy for showy's sake. It's like the film is trying to be A Colt is My Passport (1967) but doesn't have the benefit of having anything interesting to say so it just regurgitates something resembling a low-rent Mission: Impossible (1996-2015).Mechanic: Resurrection writes a check it simply can't check, providing a-typical action sequences that include a gondola top brawl, a Devil's Island-type prison break and an amphibious assault of a luxury yacht...twice. The shoddiness of the film shows itself most plainly with each successive explosion which look like they were made by Final Cut Pro students for a senior editing project. The supposed showstopper is Jason Statham grappling against the bottom of a penthouse pool, yet while he was dangling there with superhuman swagger one can't help but think, there's got to be a simpler way to do this and for god-sake light the green screen better!If fun can be had from Mechanic: Resurrection it's purely unintentional. The fighting choreography is solid though much of its impact is spoiled by flippant gore and rudimentary gun-play. The clichéd romance between Bishop and Gina is syrupy enough to coax giggles, that's if the first twenty minutes of their Thai coast courtship doesn't put you to sleep. Finally, while Bishop is painted as a smart, strong and resourceful character, his actions are commonly anything but. He's pretty much like the scimitar wielding thug in Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981); he's flashy sure but next to any audience member with a brain, he's only fun when he's unceremoniously shot down.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very stupid on many levels.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I guess having an intelligence of anything more than a brick is not required for this film.No, 3 minutes after opening credits, the first stupidity took place and it continued throughout.Jason Statham movies are either supposed to be action with a sense of almost non-stop as kicking or dark sarcastic humor - where he is either a good guy or a bad guy.This boarders on stupidity throughout much of the film and actions by somebody who is being hunted should never do - strictly for the sake of avoiding any conflict or attention...but then if that were the case of the plot, I guess this movie would not exist.Bad actions taken in circumstances where they definitely should not be - and avoiding any attention of any sort is required...I guess the writers, director, producers, actors and editors overlooked that small important and very crucial part of the plot.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Things happen without rhyme or reason, progression of the plot is very choppy, progress happens for the sake of progression, for example. This movie wouldn't be complete without a bed scene between Statham and Alba right? There's absolutely no chemistry between the two, the smiles and fake laughs come off as forced, but they end up in the sack and the movie moves along. Statham's past movies were successful because the action never really stopped. it was just madness after madness.. This movie on the other hand.. has a lot of scenes trying to tell a story that you really don't give a * about. Really slow movie with convoluted plot. See it or don't see it, You wont out on much.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Mechanic is a white male</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We are tired of seeing the Mechanic rebooted every three years, where the same story of a heterosexual white male is told over again with slight variations. What is to be lost by making the Mechanic Black? Or Muslim? Or Gay? Not a lot in my opinion. There is nothing in the Mechanic series that prevents him from being an Black African or a Gay Muslim. We need more diverse heroes. We are living in a world where equal opportunity is not as far along as we hoped it would be. Color or race will not affect the Mechanic story, it will only make it better. We can relate to him in so many ways. It is time to give the minorities the chances they had never gotten in the past. We need to end the evils of blue-eyed "whiteness".</fullReview>
