		<fullReview>What a breath of fresh air... A brilliant film in every respect. I was lucky enough to this movie at a special preview and I cant tell you how great a film this is... At first you think its about racing cars, but its not it really does give you an insight into the human condition...The rivalry between Hunt and Lauder is just played brilliantly... The race sequences are superb, really taking you back to the 70s... The heyday of this awesome sport. It shows the end of an era where the gentlemen drivers begin to give way to professional sportsmen and the end (in my opinion) of the excitement of the sport. It shows what a pale reflection today's F1 is of this once great sport, and what great characters we have lost...A real must see movie</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film is just over 2 hours long, but when it was over it seemed like I had been in the cinema about 30 minutes. The film centres on the battle for the 1976 Formula 1 World Championship, and the rivalry between the Austrian "professor" Nikki Lauda and the British playboy James Hunt. The two are depicted as enemies, but in actual fact they were good friends who trusted and respected each other on, as well as off-track. This bit of artistic licence does not spoil the film and is reasonable in order to make the battle between the two for the F1 crown more intense. The film is nicely paced. We are introduced to both characters through their own narrative and scenes that leave the watcher in no doubt as to their background and philosophy on life. The two are first seen in competition in 1970 at a Formula 3 race at Crystal Palace (where they have a coming together) and sets the scene for the rivalry throughout the film. I'm not sure if this is further artistic licence. The two definitely did race each other in F3, but I am not convinced as to whether this actual incident occurred. After that we are given a whistle stop journey between 1973 (when Hunt came into F1) to 1975. We are shown the dangerous nature of F1 at the time with the Francois Cevert accident at Watkins Glen in gory detail ? although this does not seem like gratuitous, but necessary to bring home just how unforgiving the sport was back then ? and it truly was (of the top 12 points scorers in 1976, F1 cars were to claim 3, 1 ended up in a wheelchair and 1 had his career ended by a leg crunching crash). We are then taken to 1976 and that titanic struggle for the World Crown. Only one real issue here ? the British Grand Prix result, but I suspect this was simplified in the interests of time. The casting is superb. Chris Hemsworth, an Aussie, does an excellent job on public schoolboy James Hunt, while Daniel Bruhl both sounds and looks frighteningly like the Austrian. There is little room for a supporting cast amongst the drivers which is a shame ? only Clay Regazzoni has a part of any real substance. Peterson, Watson, Depailler, Scheckter, Andretti et al could have featured a little more I think. What did their contemporaries think of the two protagonists? The supporting cast is mainly required for Hunt ? Lord Hesketh, "Bubbles" Horsley and Teddy Mayer / Tyler Alexander of McLaren, while the Ferrari team principals are rarely seen. The love angle is perfectly catered for by Olivia Wilde (Hunt's first wife Suzy) and the gorgeous Alexandra Maria Lara - of Downfall fame ? as the future Marlene Lauda. Both give quality performances. The attention to detail is superb. Although the tracks are not the actual ones (for understandable reasons) the cars, the helmets, the sponsors are all authentic. The film "feels" like it's happening in the 70's. For anyone interested in great personal stories, F1, the 70's, cars or just like to see a great film, then Rush is for you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Chris Hemsworth as James Hunt? Really??!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Really. His performance in Rush came as a huge surprise. This is his best performance by quite some margin, a role which he plays with a great deal of maturity and respect. He plays Hunt with just the right level of arrogance, cockiness, confidence and audacity to convince you that he was real life 70's playboy James Hunt, a man destined to live fast and die young.Bruhl is superb as Niki too. It's a role that he deserves much recognition for, particularly his accent and mannerisms. Lauda was one of the first of a new generation of professional driver, driving the old playboy characters out of the sport and Bruhl nails this icy determination to succeed magnificently. A particular nod goes to Christian McKay's portrayal as the slightly eccentric, petrol head extraordinaire, ever so aristocratic but hopelessly financially incompetent Lord Hesketh. The camera work is spectacular, none less so than with some very creative angles of the beautifully filmed on track action. The brief in-helmet camera shots are inspired, giving you a glimpse of the drivers world. CGI work will be spotted by the keen eyed, but you have to consider that without it that there are certain scenes involving priceless period machinery (the sound of a Cosworth DFV firing up and filling the cinema was worth the ticket price alone) that would be just impossible to film as accurately as they were depicted here with real machinery. As a result, they are able to use the CGI sparingly and to good effect.The main facts of the 1976 season are on the whole handled very accurately. Certainly, some liberties are taken with poetic licence, but this is still a scripted film and not a documentary. The factually heavy writing of the script along with beautifully filmed and liberal use of period machinery being recorded at pace on real asphalt will be enough to keep the fans of the sport well represented.It's a gripping telling of the 1976 Formula 1 season, which whilst not sharing the same shear spectacle of Howard's other 'too unbelievable to be true' film Apollo 13, Rush tells a story which would be just too unbelievable in terms of human bravery and personal destiny for any fictional story to be given credence. It's a tale which will be enough to hold the unfamiliar or casual viewer's attention with a steel firm grip to see how the different personalities handle the pressures of life both on and off the track and how rising to the top takes it's tole on these two polar opposite real life gladiators of the race track.With the lead actors clearly committed to giving their best performances yet and a tastefully handled script, Ron Howard delivers a visually impressive account of events that may well become one of his most respected directorial efforts yet.10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>F1 finally has an amazing film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an amazing film. I can't recommend it highly enough for F1 fans like me, sports fans, or anyone interested in a story of rivalry i.e. something different to the unoriginal junk movies which get churned out each year.All the crew involved should pat themselves on the back. They've done a fabulous job making this film critique, explore and honour two memorable F1 drivers.James Hunt's fun, party lifestyle along with his brash and raw driving talent. This is contrasted against Niki Lauda's methodical thinking, technical brilliance and professional lifestyle. These two characters are total opposites but as their lives are explored it also acknowledges the value of an enemy, i.e. something to beat. I believe this is a commentary on human nature in that the best of us shines when we have something to beat or overcome.Do yourself a favour and see it now.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best movie this year so far!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mr. Ron Howard is a great story teller, this movie is about human nature, love and tears.It is difficult to make a good movie about car racing, especially to make one for the time period from 1970 to 1976. I don't know how they did it to bring those old F1 cars back to life. You will feel like you are really there watching the racing, it's really unbelievable.It is truly touching to see each character played their perfect role for this movie, Chris Hemsworth did a great performance, he is such a talented and devoted actor. Daniel Brühl also did a great job on portraying the eccentric and unsociable legendary F1 driver Niki Lauda.A great movie is like having a great meal, a good starter, a good soup/salad, a good main course and a good dessert, well balanced. Rush is that good meal, it's a fun ride!I have to say I really enjoyed watching this movie. Thank you Mr. Ron Howard for making this masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having seen the trailers and TV set-up (BBC as a Grand Prix insert) I was thinking OK so I've probably seen the best of this and it's going to be 'clunky' in parts or too far up it's own a$$.But hey we can all be wrong, Ron Howard has added depth to a story I knew well, the presentation has a feel for the era the colour's are sometimes harsh and edgy.The set pieces are well researched, the owners of some of the classic F1 hardware must have had an enjoyable time (not quite so sure about the Insurance Underwriters).Where the story hits the spot for me is the acting of the main protagonists, they have life and depth. Hemsworths presentation of James Hunt is uncanny it's like a documentary he's almost as good as Daniel Day-Lewis in Lincoln.If your not a F1 fan or from the 70's it may not be more than a blokes film, but give it a go it is going to end up being a important as Apollo 13 in the life of Mr Howard and quite frankly is by far the best car racing movie ever</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bound to win Academy Award nominations - and rightly so</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1976, the rivalry between two brilliant racing car drivers, the British James Hunt and the Austrian Nikki Lauda, came to a head in the almost literally life-and-death struggle of the Formula One championship. American director Ron Howard ("Apollo 13", "A Beautiful Mind", "Frost/Nixon") and British scriptwriter Peter Morgan (both play and screenplay of "Frost/Nixon") have done a terrific job bringing the titanic struggle to the big screen, aided by some excellent casting and powerful sound and cinematography. Those were the days when most years a couple of drivers would be killed, so the stakes could not be higher.Sensibly the car racing does not over-dominate, since this is essentially a character- driven conflict, but when the racing is on screen - notably in the final race - the excitement is visceral. The Australian Chris Hemsworth (previously best known as "Thor") and the Spanish-born German Daniel Brühl ("Inglourious Basterds") are so good as the British and Austrian drivers respectively that the dialect coaches should receive a special commendation. Arguably Brühl gives the stronger performance which should auger well for his future career.A great strength of this tale is that there is not a hero or a villain. Both drivers had privileged backgrounds and were superbly talented, but both were flawed. although in very contrasting ways, including styles of thinking, driving and womanising (Olivia Wilde as model Suzy Miller and Alexandra Maria Lara as aristocratic Marlene Knaus respectively).I never saw the recent film "Senna" (2010) so "Rush" reminded me most of the much older "Grand Prix" (1966), but what is stunning about "Rush" is that it all happened. A season of the fastest sport in the world decided in the last race by one point - you couldn't make it up. Rush to see the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Gripping, Adrenaline-Ridden Fuel Ride From Howard</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just come out the cinema in York from watching Rush! Oh my god! One of the most intense films I have watched in a very long time with gripping performances from Hemsworth and Brühl! An extremely clever script from Peter Morgan in which he doesn't pick sides, but instead allows the audience to view these characters in their own light.I am a huge fan of F1 so when viewing a film relating to that sport it would be questionable that there are some anachronisms or minor problems. But no! There was not a single fault with this film, it is the most realistic sports film I have viewed! A film that portrays the rivalry between the British and Austrian world champions and the fateful crash. With some powerful dialogue from Lauda and Hunt.Even if you aren't a fan of F1, the intense action and no-holds adrenaline should keep you entertained from start to finish. With a great sway of emotions from melancholy to ecstatic! This film deserves the acclaimed reviews it has been receiving.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well made, Well Acted, Surprisingly Good Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a Cineworld Card Holder I was invited to a screening last night of Ron Howards new movie Rush.Before I start...I am not a F1 fan, but I knew enough of the history of the main protagonists to appreciate the film. The main set pieces of the film set a year before I was born in 1976, so mainly my knowledge was based on my Fathers recollection of the events. I'd seen James Hunt in interviews and recently watched footage with Niki Lauda so got an idea of the characters.The film is bang on in period, cars fashion and sets the tone excellently, the cinematography is nothing short of breathtaking and the fx are very much in keeping with the period, no ridiculous CGI.The acting, on the whole is nothing short of miraculous, Hemsworth and Bruhl are fantastic, particularly Hemsworth, who's accent, mannerisms and natural acting was a big surprise. I could see a few awards for this role. I have seen Bruhl in quite a few films and I am always impressed so this just continues the trend. All the support actors are very good in smaller roles.The film is well paced for 2 hours and quite graphic, particularly a few accident scenes.Direction: Ron Howard - nice job, I'm not a massive fan and particularly after the da vinci/Angels fiasco's a big return to decent form. The flair was there but played safe (As normal) but let the story and the actors take centre stage.If you like History in F1, a well documented rivalry and a film that capture this, watch it. It is similar to the excellent Control, Moneyball etc but with a bit of heart.8 1/2 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rush brings intense racing action</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>DIRECTION Ron Howard is amazing. His camera work here is absolutely incredible. I wouldn't at all be surprised if the cinematography and the sound editing are nominated for Oscars. The engines roaring alongside Hans Zimmer's score really gets you into the mood. The backdrop is gritty with lots of dark and gray colors giving it a tough 1970&#x2032;s aesthetic. Howard places is camera so specifically and we get so many different angles that are gripping. Camera work inside the cars giving you the intense look of driving an F1 car as well as camera's on the grass looking up as they fly by. Howard's use of slow motion is also perfect and helps build the intensity of the rivalry he is exploring here. The racing is intense and the dangers are shown in some dramatic ways as the suspense keeps building up. The biggest problem is that Formula 1 isn't the biggest of sports here in the U.S. If people can get past that and go see this, they won't regret it.Grade: ASCRIPT The story follows two F1 drivers in the mid 1970&#x2032;s that don't always get a long but have a mutual respect for one another. It centers around British driver, James Hunt and the Austrian Niki Lauda. Peter Morgan's script is brilliant and Howard brings it to life in some really great ways. In essence, both characters are the protagonist and the antagonist of the story. The film explores Hunt and his immature ways but at the same time makes him very likable. Then the story switches to Lauda and his quest to live his own life outside the big family business, yet again making him likable. However, at the same time each take their own turn in being the "bad guy" and showing you qualities that make this person flawed and unlikable in some ways. But then the movie brings it back around showing you why these characters are good characters to root for and the mutual respect they have for one another. It's the competition that drives them in this story. What makes it so great though, is that the audience really gets to choose who they want to root for. They build up and tear down each character so flawlessly. The use of narration at the beginning and at the end was a perfect choice as well. The ending becomes a bit sentimental and hits the buttons that you'd expect from Howard and company.Grade: APERFORMANCES Daniel Brühl and Chris Hemsworth are amazing. This is perhaps Hemsworth's best as he portray's James Hunt in some incredible ways. He's the dangerous driver that has Tony Stark mentalities in terms of partying, women and being extremely likable. Yet Hemsworth shows some depth and some emotion here as well which this character calls for in some ways. Brühl, who you may know from Inglorious Basterds, almost steals the show. He's the Austrian car genius who becomes famous for knowing how to make the cars lighter and faster, thus making him part of the Ferrari team. One can argue he's the bigger lead here as he narrates a good chunk of the story and brings in some great perspectives. Brühl's performance is spot on though and brings life to this character even when Lauda is more deadpanned. Olivia Wilde is good here although her character is a small role. This is about Brühl and Hemsworth and they carry the movie extremely well.Grade: A+SCORE Freakin Hans Zimmer. The dude is on fire lately. A lot of people like to criticize Zimmer for having score's that are similar or nothing new but they work. His score for Man of Steel added a lot to that film and his score for The Lone Ranger was about the only good part of that movie. And his score for Rush was really great, again. It added a lot of intensity to the racing moments and has become something he's perfected. The score here is more laid back and in the backdrop though many moments but when the action ramped up, so did his score as well as your emotion.Grade: A-FINAL THOUGHTS Rush was an unexpected pleasant surprise. Given the sports stature of F1 in the U.S., I didn't have much expectations but Ron Howard usually delivers and he does once again. The cinematography is gorgeous and makes it visually very exciting. The performances are stand outs which makes the story feel so alive in many places.Overall Grade: A</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thrilling character study</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As Asif Kapadia's gripping and extremely moving 2010 documentary Senna proved, cinema audiences have a thirst for the larger-than-life characters that inhabit the Formula One track. The sport itself is frightfully dull (although I'm sure plenty will disagree with that), but the sportsmen willing to lay down their life for a kick and a trophy are infinitely more fascinating, especially in the days of lax safety rules. The sport nowadays is little more than advertising on wheels, but when the likes of James Hunt and Niki Lauda battled it out on the track, epic rivalries were created, and no matter how talented these men were at driving these "coffins on wheels", every race could spell out death. Rush portrays the clash of two opposing personalities. The long-haired, dashing Englishman James Hunt (Chris Hemsworth) was all about the adrenaline, embracing the post-race parties and lying with the many women that would throw themselves at him. He was reckless, willing to risk his life and others in order to win, but, as described in the film, there was no better driver in the world in terms of raw talent. His rival, Austrian Niki Lauda (Daniel Bruhl), was focused, clinical, and even helped design the cars he would drive. He was the early-night type, 'rat-faced' and cold. In every sense, he's the perfect villain. But where Rush succeeds the most is challenging our early conceptions of these two characters. There's little fun to be had with Lauda, but played by Bruhl, he evolves into the underdog of the movie, perhaps the only one that actually gives a damn about his own life and the life of his opponents. This, naturally, leads to tragedy and a particularly wince-inducing scene in which Lauda requires having his lungs vacuumed, but it's at this point that we realise just what these two drivers mean to each other. As Lauda watches Hunt claw back some points in the 1976 Formula One season, it becomes clear that these two need each other to survive. Their hatred of one another only serves to fuel the flames, and leads to Lauda's defiant early return to the driver's seat, scarred and bandaged. Fast cars, beautiful women and exotic locations hardly sounds like a recognisable workload for Ron Howard, one of the most play-it-easy directors out there. His past films have been unjustifiably successful, critically and commercially, never stamping a recognisable directorial trait onto his work. Yet here, although the bright sheen of the 70's initially takes some getting used to, he has managed to create a world that is very much alive, using snappy editing, a pumping soundtrack and some growing sound design to re-create this world for petrol-heads. But he doesn't neglect his characters, and evokes the great work done on Frost/Nixon (2008), which was also a study of two giant, clashing personalities coming together on the world stage. Rush is an exhilarating experience, able to distinguish each race from the next and literally putting us in the driver's seat with the use of digital cameras. Although it occasionally drifts into formulaic territory with the introduction of the 'wives' (played by Oivia Wilde and Alexandra Maria Lara, respectively), Howard cleverly uses this as an insight into Hunt and Lauda's personalities. Hemsworth is very good in his first 'proper' post-Thor role, but it is Bruhl that you take away from the film. How he gets you to initially loath him, only to be cheering him on at the climax is the work of a great actor, and it's a crime that he has been snubbed by the Academy this year. Hopefully this will inspire a host of decent sports movies, as Rush proves that you can mix character study and even existential musings with the thrill of sport.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>RUSH is such an enthralling movie!! Amazing direction by Ron Howard, strong performances by Chris Hemsworth and Daniel Bruhl (he exactly sounded like Niki Lauda). Hanz Zimmer is the man for scoring this movie. The movie is not about the sport, it's about the hateful and envious relationship between two rivals the whole world knows about. I did not expect this movie to surprise me so much as it did, the drama was invigorating and exciting at the same time. It was such an honor to meet Niki Lauda who flew himself specially from Monza, Italy for the premier at TIFF. Such an amazing night.The movie is based on the rivalry of Britain's McLaren F1 driver James Hunt and Austrian driver Niki Lauda who represented Ferrari at the time. Great men!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A dazzling story of F1, rivalry, respect &amp; cheating death.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Those who have seen the trailer will know that Rush is the 'Formula 1 film'. The presence of Ron Howard's and Chris Hemsworth's names above the title may put some bums on seats but the fact of it being a film about motor racing will undoubtedly ostracize some potential viewers.So stop right there. Rush is not a movie about motor racing for speed fans any more than Titanic was about sailing for merchant seamen. Rush is a superbly shot, directed, edited and performed film that transcends the sport of motor racing, just as the principal protagonists themselves did almost forty years ago.The rivalry between F1 drivers James Hunt (Hemsworth) and Niki Lauda (Daniel Brühl) is common knowledge. Just a couple of minutes trawling through Google's gifts will tell you how many championships each driver won, how they met, how they sparred, how they lived and (nearly) died? Rush isn't a film that tells you their story. Rush is the film that takes you into their world and shows you how that story unfolded in all its fast, crazy, riotous, dazzling, cynical, brash excess. By the end you may still not want to be an F1 driver or even watch a grand prix, but you sure as hell will wish you could have been there for at least some of the 70s.Howard has provided us with a mixed bag of films over the years with schmaltzy, flicks (A Beautiful Mind), thoughtful biopics (Frost/Nixon), compelling dramas (Apollo 13) and utter twaddle (Angels and Demons). So which category would Rush fall into? The tension Howard creates is ridiculous. Pistons pump, colours blur, the scream of engines deafen us. The editing is so tight it feels as though something will snap. The anticipation prickles the skin and, though we already know what and when, it is almost too much for us to watch it unfold. Technically, Rush verges on exquisite. The digital creation blends flawlessly with the live action and the skids, tumbles, crashes and explosions are horrifying.But it isn't just with the speed and madness around the track where Howard guides perfectly. The hospital scenes when Lauda is treated are almost grotesque. We find ourselves shying away from the visuals, involuntarily grimacing at Lauda's agony even when he demands more pain in order to drive him towards recovery and revenge.Rush boasts one of the finest film scores of the year so far with Hans Zimmer proving why he is among the busiest composers in Hollywood. It's not that the score that makes the film, but it enhances it beautifully, adding emotional colour to the startling visuals to magnify the tension.The joint leads are on impeccable form. Hemsworth portrays Hunt as the playboy we wish we could be (or bed) and his charisma doesn't ooze, it gushes. He is arrogant, cocksure, charming and handsome. He makes it obvious why men wanted Hunt's life and so many women welcomed him into theirs. It is a confident, full performance from Hemsworth that marks him out yet again as an actor with a certain chameleon-like quality and undeniable star power. Immediately we like Hunt but as 123 minutes rush by, he evolves into a flawed man we admire but ultimately decide we don't really want to be and, in some ways, pity. It's a fine performance that engages us on every level.When Brühl's (The Edukators, Inglorious Basterds) Lauda strides onto the screen, it is with purpose, his Austrian directness and confidence taken as conceit and arrogance. He does not suffer fools (or almost anyone else) whether they are subordinates, rivals or the men paying for his drive. Supremely confident to the exclusion of social niceties, the Lauda we observe puts our backs up immediately but, just as the Hunt on screen evolves, so, too, does Lauda and by the film's end our allegiance has wavered. It is a sensitive performance from Brühl and his understanding of the man he portrays and clear admiration for him infects us thoroughly.Some of the dialogue is lumpy, there are numerous liberties taken with the truth (though not to the extent that U571 completely rewrote history!) and much is glossed over. Howard has perhaps tried too hard to appeal to a mass audience by focusing on the principal women in the drivers' lives, notably Hunt's wife, Suzy (Olivia Wilde) and Brühl's, Marlene (Alexandra Maria Lara). In Marlene's case, she is relatively impactful on her husband's life, suffering through his accident with him. In Suzy's case, however, though she was influential on a period of Hunt's career, it is difficult to see her as anything other than a bystander in his life and yet Howard sees fit to return to her though she is far from his thoughts.These are minor quibbles that make Rush a very good film instead of a 'great'. Nevertheless, my companion for the film who has no interest in motor racing and less knowledge gave a simple summary: "Excellent." Me? I'm a fair weather F1 fan. If there is a realistic hope of Button, Hamilton and Di Resta winning or there's been enough hype, I'm there. Otherwise it's Formula what? But, as I wrote, Rush transcends the sport. I was gripped throughout, I gritted my teeth, I gasped, clenched my buttocks and willed the drivers to the finish, on the track, in the hospital and in life.For more reviews from The Squiss, subscribe to my blog and like the Facebook page.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>F1 fan or not, You will Love this movie!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>i just saw this movie a few days ago at a special advanced screening. as and avid F1 fan myself i loved it. this review might contain Spoiloers depending on how much you want to know about the movie. i don't give many movies a 10/10 but this one got it. overall a superb movie, this is Hollywood's first attempt at telling and showing F1 on the big screen and they nailed it. yes there were a few things they could have done better but not everything is perfect. When you hear those V12 engines start up in the opening scene, you get that Rush of testosterone in the pit of your stomach because of the sheer ferociousness of the sound in the theater. from that point on you are hooked. even if your not an F1 fan that scene will make you want more. every girl i talked to about the movie said they were seeing it for Hemsworth, and after the movie they were in awe about the awesomeness of Formula 1 and what it takes to succeed in the sport. from then on the movie moves at a good pace. as an F1 fan i wish there were a few more race scenes, but it is a Hollywood movie not a documentary so they have to appeal to everyone. the plot and the way the present it was great. i wish they went a little more in depth on Lauda and Hunts backgrounds and also went more in depth on the supporting characters like andretti and regazzoni. but since they didn't do that it lead to a better look at the intense rivalry between lauda and hunt. the small amount of comedy that was in it was very funny, it was somewhat unexpected. the Cinematography is amazing. so many different shots throughout the car and driver as an audience you feel like your right there with them, and as an F1 fan you get all the shots you expect and more. you also get a very good sense of the 1970s era, it feels like a movie made in the 70s with modern quality. some parts look gritty like they used 35mm film.overall i think this is one of, if not the best movie I've ever seen. i saw it 4 days ago and i cant stop thinking and replaying scenes from the movie in my head. i cannot wait for it to come out on blu ray. obviously go see it if your an F1 fan, but even if you aren't i guarantee you will like it. take your girlfriend or sister or mom to go see it and they will enjoy it no matter what. and you definitely wont be bored, it kept me on the edge of my seat the entire movie. not one person left the theater once it started.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More than just a film about cars.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>''Rush'' is a very good film about the rivalry between two Formula 1 race car drivers and their lives behind it. Directed by Ron Howard, the film is a triumph concerning action sequences, film editing and sound. Despite it being a sports film about racing, ''Rush'' never fails to develop its characters, its story and its suspense thus delivering a deeply satisfying conclusion.Beginning with the film's performances, one would expect to see little character development, acting and emotion but a whole lot of action. However, this is not the case. The film's performances are very good. Daniel Brühl gives an outstanding performance as Austrian Niki Lauda: from the character's personality, body movement, expressions and emotions to his speaking accent, Brühl manages to handle it more than well and deliver a very authentic and powerful performance. From his first appearance in the film, he stays a very powerful figure throughout the film and very memorable after it. He realizes the character's motives and feelings which enables him to fully portray his character. Despite his performances in films such as ''Thor'', ''Red Dawn'' and ''The Cabin in the Woods'', Chris Hemsworth gives a decent enough performance as James Hunt. He is far from outstanding but he portrays his character as he should be, never overacting nor underplaying his character, thus delivering a satisfying and believable performance as a race car driver. The rest of the cast doesn't have much screen time since the film mainly focuses on the two protagonists but their acting does not disappoint.The film's exhilarating action sequences are probably the main reason people will go to see it and they will not be disappointed. With rapid but smooth editing, the renowned film editing duo (Daniel P. Hanley, Mike Hill) manages to ''tell'' the story rather clearly rather than just smothering it under its heavy action scenes. Other technical aspects such as sound editing, sound mixing and cinematography are superb. Sound, especially, plays a very important role in the film and luckily, the sound is clear, realistic and not bombastic as most Hollywood action films. The racing sequences are superb: we see them from every angle possible, never confusing nor annoying the viewer with their rapid cuts, instead keeping the viewer interested (especially during the final climatic race). As for the score, Hans Zimmer's fast paced music adds nicely to the film's racing sequences, turning the suspense meter way up without distracting the viewer. As with most of Zimmer's works, the film's score is very epic and memorable which captures the film's action.What works very well in the film is the fact that it's not just a film full or car explosions, racing and trophies but a film which tells the story of two people who succeeded in the race tracks, a film which doesn't drown its characters under its impressive action sequences but allows them to breath.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Rush" Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Rush" is one of the best films of the year. I was pleasantly surprised by the amount of depth and emotional story telling this film possess. From its brilliant script that infuses humor, drama, and a story about a fascinating rivalry to its impeccable and detailed oriented direction, this film succeeds on every level.Ron Howard's direction is extremely noteworthy as I felt like a part of the journey and involved with the characters as I cheered them on. In the beginning, I was rooting for James, but as the movie progresses and things unravel, I was cheering for Niki. However, as the movie moves forward, I couldn't choose one over the other. This is the type of engagement that I love in movies, it keeps the audience involved and contently thinking about every situation and the characters as a whole.This film is well edited and shot as well. I couldn't find a useless or uninteresting moment in this film. Everything flowed very well and the film moved at a brisk pace. It felt as every shot or sequence is catered to moving and developing the characters and their story forward. The racing sequences are well shot and make you feel a part of the race. My heart rushed when characters successfully made narrow life endangering turns. It is a really good film to look at as the scenery and environment crafted feels inviting and absorbing.The cast in this film is superb. Chris Hemsworth gives his finest performance to date as a carefree playboy. Even though his character James Hunt doesn't appear serious, he struggles with his inner demons trying to be taken a bit more seriously. Daniel Bruhl also gives and equally impressive, if not better, performance as Niki Lauda an arrogant self-absorbent racer. It's interesting to see his character go from caring only about himself and racing to something more important. The greatest aspect of the characters are their interactions. I really enjoy how they can't stand each other, but can't be successful without each other either. While they hate one another, they find a mutual respect for the other. It's quite endearing to see how they have each others back off the tracks.Overall, "Rush" is an amazing movie and totally worth your time. It's a movie that has everything, from drama to humor to love. The greatest aspect of the film is its truly brilliant and masterful score by Hans Zimmer. His score gives the right amount of emotional punch along with improving everything we see and giving the film a greater amount of importance. I give this film an extremely high 4.5/5, a well oiled film that has no wasted parts.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I was a child, I used to walk out of movies all the time with chills and a sense of awe and wonder, thinking that was the best movie I had ever seen. However, that's because I WAS a child and at the time, any movie was automatically on that list.It has been a LONG time since I had that feeling. Usually, I now walk out of the theater saying "Yeah, that was a great movie, but it's not one of the best I have ever seen.""RUSH" was different. When I walked out of that movie, I had those chills and that sense of awe and wonder again. Not only did that movie have me at the edge of my seat at every turn like a good racing movie should, but I can safely say that that movie had the best cinematography that I have ever seen in any film. More often than not, I was sitting there thinking "Holy s**t, how did they get a shot like that??" To this day, when I think about that movie, I still ask myself that question. I would not be surprised in the least if this movie wins the Academy Award for Best Cinematography.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Daniel Bruhl even beats Oscar bound Leonardo</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Niki Lauder is among the most well known personalities in the history of Formula One. Even today millions of Germans watch his TV presentation at every race. We know his manner and speech extremely well and any actor portraying him faces an uphill if not impossible task. But Daniel Bruhl delivers a performance so wonderfully convincing in his faithful and profound portrayal that he should clearly be among the Oscar nominees for Best Actor. The story of Lauda's famous struggle with Hunt in 1976 has become the stuff of legends. And perhaps this production has used some artistic license to enhance them. But the film isn't really about the thrilling story of those events. That's just the vehicle for a much deeper drama examining the ever relevant dialectic between hedonism and pragmatism. It's about the self beneath the skin rather than the glamor of the surface: a concept normally quite alien to the Oscar awarding Hollywood elite. So poor Daniel Bruhl must await another vehicle to display his superb talents. And one day he might be remembered internationally in his career as Niki was himself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Everything It Should Be</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After a short framing section, this starts off with a bloody-mouthed Chris Hemsworth in half-undone racing coveralls strutting into an emergency room on a wave of testosterone like a cock into a hen house. Every female head in the place turns, and a glaze of lust falls across nurse Natalie Dormer's face. Within a minute and 4 lines of dialogue, he and she are doing the horizontal mambo on the examining table and, through a series of quick cuts, plenty of other places. In short, it looks like we're going to get a 16 year old boy's dream of being a race car driver.It turns out to be a great deal more. Director Howard and writer Morgan turn out to have a lot more empathy with the precise, earnest, &#x171;ber-professional Austrian Niki Lauda (known as the Rat or the Sour Kraut) than they do with long haired, gorgeous English party animal James Hunt ? there's a montage after Hunt wins the 1976 Formula 1 driving championship that subtly trivializes and belittles what he does with his victory, and a concluding t?te á t?te between Hunt and Lauda that makes it explicit. This isn't surprising considering the way the critics have treated Howard's body of work over the years. But along the way we're treated to a struggle between Cavalier and Roundhead, JKF and Nixon, inspiration and perspiration that is never less than captivating. The personal distaste between the two men, the contrast of styles, and the way they get into each other's heads are too intense for the subject of their rivalry, which after all is only motor racing. You feel that they were born 30 years too late, and that they should have been up in the sky a generation earlier, trying to kill each other in Spitfires and Messerschmitts instead of zipping around in McLarens and Ferraris. The gorgeous women (Dormer, Olivia Wilde, Alexandra Maria Lara) are more or less along for the ride as arm candy, although Hunt gets to display some dry, malicious English wit after his supermodel wife (Wilde) dumps him for Richard Burton. The racing sequences pull you in, and the overwhelming sound design gives you a real feel for the power (and fascination) of the internal combustion engine. The climactic race is subtly different than you'd expect from a sports movie but absolutely true to the characters.This is not great art, but it is thrilling popcorn entertainment the way it's supposed to be done, and it is to racing movies like Das Boot is to submarine movies. They'll never have to make another one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ron Howard shows what he does best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The true story of the rivalry between F1 drivers James Hunt and Niki Lauda and the 1976 Formula One season is one of those stories where true life is more extraordinary then fiction. Fortunately two men with great experience at adapting true life stories, Ron Howard and Peter Morgan, have taken this project on, giving us a movie that is about a clash of ideals and personalities as well as about the drive of motor sports.James Hunt (Chris Hemsworth) and Niki Lauda (Daniel Brühl) are racing drivers with different approaches and philosophies whose rivalry starts in Formula Three racing. Hunt is a good looking playboy who enjoys drinking, partying and sex and has charisma to boot. Lauda is a serious minded, extremely determined, technically astute and is able to get the most out of a car, but is a cold, distant man who drives people away. Soon the men's rivalry see them battling it out in Formula One leading to the 1976 season where back-stabbing, danger and disaster affects the sport.As a sports movie Rush is a very well made and entertaining film that focuses on its characters ideals and differences. Hemsworth and Brühl are in top form as they play these very different men. Lauda is a self- determined man who is willing to risk everything to get into F1, but easily rubs people the wrong way, whilst Hunt had a greater support network, media friendly but is a loose cannon. Both end up becoming each other's hubris as they take bigger risks in a sport that already dangerous.As well as the focus of their profession, Rush looks at the personal lifestyles of the two drivers, particularly Hunt's as he womanizes as Lauda settles down with a woman. Hunt is a thrill seeker who uses pure talent whilst Lauda is aware of the risks of his profession, but does not want to add to them.To anyone who knows about Niki Lauda is he suffers a tragedy and the easy route would have been to make Rocky style picture about someone overcoming adversity. Fortunately, Howard and Morgan made something more interesting by showing both men to be faulted, that Lauda is not a man who is easy to like, making personal digs against and being a very sore loser.At a running of two hours, three minutes, Rush moves along at a very brisk pace. The first 40 to 45 minutes focuses on a six year period as the rivalry builds up. Many story elements are dealt with quickly. A great example of this is when Hunt meets model Suzy Miller (Olivia Wilde, who does an impressive English accent) in the team garages and the next scene is them getting married. Rush is a movie that tackles many story elements with broad brushstrokes. It does seem like a longer cut may exist.Even though the film is called Rush, Howard and Morgan build up to the racing segments. We get a F3 race near the beginning and then we have a long wait the F1 races. Howard and Morgan focus on three main races in the 1976 season, Nürburgring, Germany, Monza, Italy and Fuji, Japan. Howard shows his technical acumen with the racing sequences, as we get up close to the action on screen with camera being place many on the parts of the cars, in the driving seat and even in the engine and in the air gun during a tyre change. There are intense, exciting sequences as Howard uses stylistic flashes and slo-mo as we see how dangerous races were in the 70s. Morgan also uses a similar montage trick he used in The Damned United to quickly build a picture of the '76 season with Howard using title cards to the sequence a bit of flash.The story about James Hunt or Niki Lauda could have made for a compelling movie on their own terms, but Howard and Morgan give us two films in one. Rush is a very well-made, engaging and compelling sports flick that is character driven and is about the build-up as well as the racing.Please visit www.entertainmentfuse.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>this is the story of two formula one drivers. one (hunt) is a reckless hunk, a smooth-talking, get-all-the-girls typical type of driver who amazingly drives very well. the other (lauda) a confident, disciplined, laid back kind of guy, doesn't care what you think of him, luckily comes from a rich family and also a super-skilled driver. flip side is he's also a pompous, arrogant, know-it-all on cars, engines, etc therefore the kind of guy nobody likes. the movie takes us through the rivalry of these two guys in the very dangerous F1 racing scene of the 70's. It shows how Lauda's discipline gives him an edge over his rival but also how Hunt's likability and sometimes cunning ways evens this score! All in a riveting movie which will keep you glued to your screen till the end. everyone of us will relate to one of the two opposing characters in the movie, and will probably be rooting for your guy to come out tops.. the danger in the races will keep you on toes throughout, remember this is from a true story and things do get awry in true stories..all in all riveting - from start to finish!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Amazing movie with excellent pace and perfect portrayals, with an especially outstanding performance by Daniel Brühl as Niki Lauda. Watching it in German, I tended to forget the fact I see an actor and not the original most of the film. Stunning!I also loved the racing scenes, filmed with excellent camera work and cutting, something I have never seen before in a Hollywood feature like this. I found the film very well balanced concerning personal scenes and the racing sport. The film made you not sympathize too much with one of the characters, at another point I found myself liking them both. One of the major aspects for the film being so intriguing from my point of view is, besides all the above mentioned points, that it does not take itself too seriously. It has no universal or fundamental message to convey and the film acknowledges exactly that. It's fun to watch, exciting, appealing and sometimes disgusting at the same time!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Slick and sexy if flawed. Howard's best work yet.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rush has my personal distinction of being the first film I've seen after reading the script. Why did I do that? Mostly curiosity of how a film like this is written. I want to be a screenwriter so I wanted to see how it's done, especially those races. It's not the only film of the next four months that I've read nor the first of the bunch. I read upcoming films because reading scripts of films I know can be distracting trying to picture them for myself and unproduced scripts are most likely unproduced for a reason. Upcoming films means I have seen glimpses of them from the trailer but not too much and they're considered good enough to be produced right now. I wouldn't read a potential favourite but I'm still generally excited for the big films of the year. Anyway, it had to be said as it did affect my viewing experience, but it was certainly not a hindrance. It was only a hindrance for differentiating the film and script between the few scenes cut and added but there are only few and mostly for the better.The first thing I got from the script was that Rush is all about sex appeal. James Hunt's introduction is written in big bold words given its own line: Sexy. The characters inhabit the extravagant sexy world of the 1970s with all of its grainy flavours and gritty vices. The use of words in the script invite vibrant technical potential in the editing and cinematography department for a audio-visual sensory experience over anything else. All this is designed as a juxtaposition to Niki Lauda, of whom is frequently described as a rat. Rush is sex vs. rat. Which is fine as an oversimplification, but it trades characterisation for superficial personality traits. As charming as Chris Hemsworth and Daniel Bruhl (who is good, not as great as his current acclaim) are in their roles, they rarely feel like relatable human beings. Granted, the film wants them to feel larger than life but personally I prefer emotional immersion than a spectacle that pushes its audiences away. But flash if it must and flash it does well.The rival's back-and-forth continues throughout the film by constantly switching protagonists which although its intentions are that it wants to cover all ground, it results in us never feeling intimate with either of them, especially as each scene is rather short. Ironically, it feels rushed. It's scared of being boring. However, it's the film's third act that makes it all worth it. In that final race, everyone in front and behind camera is at the top of their game and it's a fantastically nail-biting sequence. Even if you know the result, it raises the stakes magnificently. I even forgot what happened by then. Not only is it thrilling but by this point the rivals have found an emotionally rewarding bond, even if they are still at odds. The film quite reminds me of last year's Argo in its pace and rock and roll atmosphere but its final cathartic act makes Rush a stronger film over last years Best Picture. Some have considered that this might be this year's Best Picture and Director. Even if 12 Years A Slave and Gravity weren't this year, I wouldn't see it happening, but after seeing the film I can see it earning a nomination, which I didn't after reading the script.However, the representation of women is still terribly neglected. They are forever on the side, forever turned on (or off) for the men and racing. Olivia Wilde's character is a joke. It's not her fault, it's just what she had to work with. I wish the film didn't bother rather than awkwardly work women in, as there isn't a developed one here, even though the existence of Lauda's wife becomes key in the third act. That's what Rush is like until its third act, unfocused. The best scenes are the longer ones which move the story forward. Ron Howard is usually a very bland director. My favourite of his films is The Grinch, mostly for nostalgic reasons. What lifts Rush is the signature work of Danny Boyle's regular cinematographer Anthony Dod Mantle. He may have let Trance down but his kinetic closeups make the film, even his documentary-esque wides can be messy and not cut well together. They still made it cinematic. Zimmer's score does a great job of matching up to that standard. I wouldn't call Rush a winner, but it's worth watching. 7/10</fullReview>

Unusually its shot from both points of view that been Hunt and Lauda as each are given equal screen time. The Two lead actors are well cast and convincing even the makeup for Lauda's facial injuries are near perfect, it just goes to show that when Ron Howard when he's on top of his game what he can give to the screen.Very little archive footage is used and this is at the end of the film which follows up life after the 1976 championships. The costumes, hair styles and mannerism's of the time from what I remember of the 70's are spot on. 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>'This is the Business We Have Chosen"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Chris Hemsworth and Daniel Bruhl lead the way here with superb performances as Formula One race drivers James Hunt and Niki Lauder respectively. The movie focuses mainly on the bitter rivalry between the two for the World Championship of Formula One racing, in 1976. They're polar opposites in personality with the British driver Hunt being a cocky free-spirit believing in living each day to the fullest, while Lauder is the tense, serious, and often arrogant Austrian who calculates his every move.There are some "bumps along the way" in the film as I felt the scenes involving Lauda's post-crash burns, treatment, and eventual disfigurement were overly graphic. Also, sometimes I wondered if the egos they possessed, which led them to take at times insane risks, were too much, but then I thought of the line from "The Godfather", "this is the business we have chosen" and felt it was a good explanation of it all.Acclaimed filmmaker Ron Howard is in the director's chair here, and the screenplay was written by the very talented Peter Morgan (The Queen, The Damned United).All in all, I found this movie to be quite engrossing, enhanced by a poignant ending and actual clips of the real Hunt and Lauda.As an aside, if you like this film you may want to check out the riveting documentary "Senna", which centered on a similar theme, with the rivalry of drivers Ayrton Senna and Alain Prost.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was never much interested in Formula 1 and if someone would have presented this as a film about sports, I am sure it would not have sparked my curiosity very much. Admittedly, Chris Hemsworth sold it to me (he's all over the poster :D), but I was pleasantly rewarded with much more than his pretty looks and good performance. This film offers quite a rush as it shows an adrenaline-packed moment in the lives of two passionate men. Based on the true story of Lauda's and Hunt's rivalry during the 1970's, it retells the events that lead to their respective winning of the World Cup. The strong, engaging plot given by a good script reveals two very different characters, bound to forever compete by their common goal of being number one. There is an underlying respect between the two, almost like a brotherhood in the end. There is definitely a parallel between their personalities and the way their live their lives, which, though not too subtle, adds depth to the story. One of the men is precise, prudent, and methodical, the other is exuberant, charming and has unending "joie de vivre". Yet both are risk- takers, both know they are good and don't accept defeat. They stimulate each other into always giving their best through constant competition and comparison. Maybe they even like each other.And while they drive, we race with them; we feel the hurt, we sense the drive. There is beauty to it: an almost artistic perspective of the mechanical as something alive and pumping.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Rush tells the true story of the heated rivalry between two Formula 1 drivers; playboy and hot head James Hunt (Thor) and level-headed and calculated Niki Lauda (a brilliant Daniel Bruhl). Rush begins with their humble beginnings in Formula 3 and their instant distaste for each other, and continues with their rise to Formula 1 and Niki Lauda's infamous crash that almost claimed his life. After the accident, their rivalry evolves from being fueled by hatred to one of mutual respectRush gets off to a rocky start, but once it gets its footing it envelops you in an atmosphere that is gloriously 70's. The cars, the hair, and vibrate colors is pure time machine. Rush is a born entertainer, a natural extrovert, the people are beautiful, the cars are flash, the sun is bright, the locations are breathtaking and the action is remarkable. You are constantly bombarded with high quality sensations. It's a dazzling experience.Rush is fun in a superficial sort of way, but the script only sporadically delves below surface of its source material. It comes down to the script not spending enough time on Hunt and Lauda's rivalry and hanging around too long on some of it's side plots. Also, there is no reason this movie needed to be "R" rated; The sex scenes and cursing could have easily been toned down or cut all together and taken nothing away from the core of Rush's appeal. In fact it would have streamlined the script and made Rush appeal to a wider audience.Don't worry, you probably won't notice my complaints, and if you do you won't care a damn. Rush is entertaining, gloriously action packed, beautiful to look at and is exceptionally well executed. Ron Howard's directing, particularly during the racing scenes is stellar and Hans Zimmer's scoring is hair-raisingly awesome. Rush is refreshingly slick, suave and adrenaline-infused. I say you'll be beguiled by it like I have, but the feeling won't resonate.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A much better movie than I expected, but I didn't know what to expect...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went in there really not knowing anything about the film other than it was a racing movie. I was really hoping it was not something along the lines of "Days of Thunder', luckily it wasn't. I was very entertained as the movie caught my attention at the start and held it all the way through. Nothing exceptional about the acting but some very good, believable performances. Daniel Brühl played in my opinion an excellent Niki Lauda and Hemsworth seemed to be right on in his portrayal of James Hunt (and not too out of character if the tabloids are right, lol). To be honest there was not a lot of room for them to show their acting chops as this was based on real people and actual events and staying in character was important. Some decent car racing scenes but it wasn't about that as much as the story of the people involved. It is not filled with or overwhelmed by actual racing scenes or CGI. It had a great balance of action, acting and human interest. SPOILER ALERT: During the scene with the car fire you could actually feel the audience getting drawn in and hushed whispers abounded, "oh my god", "did that actually happen?", "is he going to die?", etc. And when the movie ended (at just the right time, not too long or too short of a film) the people in the audience in the theater I was in started applauding. I don't remember the last time I saw that happen. But I joined in as I had just been impressed and entertained...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very close to cinematic perfection</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In my world it is impossible to achieve a 10 out of 10. It does not exist. That is the only reason Rush gets 9 points from me. The last 10min of this film are as close to cinematic perfection as I have seen. The story, the score, the cinematography all reach a beautiful climax. I would urge anyone to watch this film, even if they are not Formula One fans.The casting is absolutely brilliant if you compare the actors with the people they are based on. The acting is also great, with Daniel Bruehl picking up on small traits of his character that make him even more believable."Everyone needs an enemy in life" Someone to bust his balls and push him further. The themes in the story are about working hard and never giving up. But also about enjoying life after having worked hard. There is no antagonist in this story, only two equally great but very different protagonists and the audience has to decide who they identify with more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A bold and exhilarating sports drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't particularly gravitate towards sports movies, primarily because I'm just not into sports but also because a lot of them are cliché-ridden underdog stories that have been done to death. Not so with RUSH. In what is the best film that Ron Howard has done in years, Chris Hemsworth and Daniel Bruhl give excellent performances as James Hunt and Niki Lauda: Formula One drivers whose rivalry gave each other purpose and motivation to succeed. As personalities, they couldn't have been more different. James Hunt was brash, more of a ladies' man and reveled in the fame that being a race car driver afforded. Niki Lauda was more cold, calculating and concerned with the technical aspects of racing, and he could also be quite blunt. What I liked about this movie, aside from the racing aspect, was the examination of these two polar opposite personalities and the way in which they pushed each other forward. There is plenty of screen time allotted to establishing their characters, and once they meet, sparks fly. I thought both Chris Hemsworth and Daniel Bruhl did an excellent job in portraying these two men, and made it seem very believable. Of course, this is a racing movie, so the other question would be how that aspect stacks up. No lie, this movie had some of the best, and most thrilling racing sequences I've seen. Ever. Apparently, they had actual drivers (and the actors) drive Formula One cars at high speeds and attached cameras to the outside to capture the feel of what it would be like to be in one of those cars. It was really exhilarating stuff, and it's a pity that I wasn't able to catch this in theaters when it first came out. I also should mention the incredible score by Hans Zimmer, who is quickly becoming one of my favorite film composers. He created an epic feel, not unlike what he did with Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight trilogy. Still, it was distinct from that iconic score and added a lot to the overall feel of the film. There was also a good selection of 1970's classic rock. Overall, there's not a thing I can think of that's even a little wrong with this film. Every aspect of it perfectly displays the skills of the talent involved, and the central story elevates it above your typical sports drama. Even if sports movies aren't your thing, you'd be remiss for not giving this one a try.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Rush is one of the ultimate biographical sports drama movies I've come across. The movie is gripping till the very end and a must watch esp. for racing fans. This movie is the most apt adaptation of the real life events between the F1 racers Niki Lauda and James Hunt.It is obvious that the crew and cast have worked sagaciously to make this as good (and better) to describe the relationship between these two racers perfectly to the real life characters that the movie is based upon.Every scene in the movie has been exciting till the very end and towards the end the viewer would only feel the awe of the whole experience. It is my hope that there be a sequel to this with the same crew perhaps based on the life of 7-time world champion Michael Schumacher as it is in the same genre and I'm certain it would be a wonderful watch like how this movie turned out to be!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You not only watch this film, but listen to it. Ron Howard knows what's up with F1. I can see a sound editor's great effort on recording/editing the noise of machines back in these days.... flat 12 and DFV. When the film is based on a real story, its all about how to wrap it up with back stories that were not told on TV. The complex feeling of being a racer, inferiority and superiority, outside of their machines was nailed down perfectly. I also knew that actors were so carefully chosen. When I finish watching this film, I thought "who else but Hemsworth and Bruhl could act Hunt and Lauda?" While some films that based on a real story chooses to use the actor who is in totally different impression to the original person, this film makes you feel like you are watching real Hunt and Lauda racing each other again.Spectacular story (of course), awesome CGI (especially the "heavy rain") and again, the noise of engines....If you are F1 fan, watch it. If not, watch it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Rush (2013) Director: Ron HowardThis movie narrates the true accounts of the sporting rivalry between Niki Lauda and James Hunt, F1 racing champions in the mid 1970's.Director Ron Howard returns to his brilliant version as a story-teller after crowd-pleasers like the two Robert Langdon movies and the middling movie 'The Dilemma'. His last real good movie was Frost/Nixon about 5 years prior to this one.This movie narrates the stories of two F1 legends who are not very popular to the post 1980's ilk. I actually read about Niki Lauda a few years ago in a story of guts and perseverance ? Niki suffered severe burns when his car crashed in a F1 race in Germany with part of his face burnt off and his lungs damaged with internal burns. However 6 weeks after that incident, he returns to the race track in Italy and comes in 4th place. Just an amazing story. Didn't realize then that I was going to see it in a movie.Howard does a good job setting up the back story of characters ? Hemsworth (Thor) as Hunt and Bruhl as Lauda ? about their appetite for racing, cars and success. Their initial disdain for each other sets each on the path for achieving racing glory. While Hunt partied, Lauda engineered. The movie explores the dynamics and business of racing, the life of racers, the engineering marvel and the frenzy of the sport.Zimmer's music is outstanding, and the camera work &amp; sound editing is simply brilliant. The race sequences are a stand-out and keep you on the edge of your seat. If you don't know your F1 history then it's even more nerve wracking.In my opinion, the movie focused on Hunt ? how he was wronged and how he wronged. But my attention and respect was saved for Niki Lauda who was able to manage his fame and stature in real life. He is truly a living icon.Both Hemsworth and Bruhl give memorable performances and they live their characters on screen plus a fine return to form for our good old Richie Cunningham. :)This is one of the best movies released in 2013. Watch it if you haven't.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to admit, I never thought I'd be really convinced by this movie. I don't really have a keen interest in the Formula and only really know Lauda, but even his story was not one that I could recite or anything. It might have helped or not, but I can say, that this drama is more than just a movie about two fast drivers.It's also a duel that takes place with two different life styles, two different characters. Daniel Brühl might be German, but his performance as Austrian racing legend Lauda is his best to date. Ron Howard knows how to make movies and this is another showcase for that. Because while this does focus on the drama and the life story, you still get racing scenes, on and off the tracks. Men will be men, I guess ...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>1976 was an exciting year in Formula One racing.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a Ron Howard film of a predominantly true telling of the 1976 year of Formula One racing. Featured are the world champion from 1975, Austrian Niki Lauda, and his rival Brit James Hunt, seeking the world championship. Lauda and Hunt were quite opposites, the Austrian the focused, precise, calculating racer. It was a profession he was very good at. The Brit a flamboyant risk-taker, a womanizer who enjoyed a good drunk after a victory, and who nervously vomited before a big race. The actors chosen are excellent, with costuming and makeup resembling the real racers quite closely. The Aussie Chris Hemsworth puts on his best British accent as James Hunt, and Daniel Brühl (full name ' Daniel César Martín Brühl González Domingo ') is authentic as Niki Lauda.This is much more than a telling of the racing season. In the hands of director Ron Howard we are treated to selective slow motion and stop action, and even POV shots of the racing engine's intake and exhaust valves at work from inside the combustion chamber. In slow motion, of course! Surely some archival footage was used, but they recreated certain racing situations very realistically. Overall the cinematography (shot digitally) and the sound track are superb. A very enjoyable movie, of two fierce competitors who gained deep respect for each other, in spite of their attempts to bury each other on the track.Their spouses were capably played by Olivia Wilde as Suzy Miller Hunt and Alexandra Maria Lara as Marlene Lauda. Of note, Hunt died at a relatively young age of 45, but Lauda is still going strong in his 60s, as an aviation entrepreneur.SPOILERS: During the 1976 season, in one race Lauda crashed and unable to get out of his car quickly enough was burned very badly. He was in the hospital for several weeks, at first they were not sure he would survive because of combustion junk in his lungs. But he actually returned to racing less than two months after the accident, and in the final race of the season, in the rain in Japan, Lauda pulled out after a few laps, deeming the conditions too dangerous. Hunt kept racing, needing to finish 3rd or better to win the points title for the year. He did, barely, and won by one point over Lauda, and shortly after seemingly lost interest in being world champion again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What's This? A Ron Howard Movie That Isn't Intolerable?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I never thought I would ever watch a Ron Howard movie again much less write a good review of one.Howard hasn't made a movie since "Parenthood" that has not bored me to tears and almost angered me with its pedestrian refusal to take any risks. He's turned into a lesser version of Steven Spielberg -- his films are just as maudlin and emotionally manipulative, but they lack Spielberg's technical panache.However, the great reviews of "Rush" and the awards attention that swirled briefly around Daniel Bruhl got my butt in the seat for it, and I was surprised by actually liking it. It's a lean, mean telling of the intense rivalry between race car drivers James Hunt and Niki Lauda. You don't need to care much about race car driving (I certainly don't) to enjoy the story, particularly that of Lauda, who overcame a devastating accident to return to the track. Bruhl is as good as everyone said he was at the time, and Chris Hemsworth, as Hunt, is serviceable if nothing special. This is still a Ron Howard film, so don't expect it to push any boundaries, but it's much more technically daring than anything else he's made, the cinematography and editing putting the audience in the driver's seat more than once.Grade: A-</fullReview>

		<fullReview>White-knuckle racing with tons of heart and a raging fire in the pit of its stomach. Like the similarly adrenaline-drenched "Warrior" before it, Rush does an excellent job of evenly pursuing its dual leads, examining both to such lengths that we have ample reason to pull for each in their climactic showdown. Directly inspired by the real men behind the story, its depiction of both personalities, warts and all, is masterful. Ron Howard's always known which strings to tug for maximum emotional impact in his work, but that usually comes at a price: simple, one-dimensional caricatures at the helm. Rush represents an evolution for the director; he no longer shies away from the darker, less desirable elements of his leading man/men, and that strong investment in their development pays dividends at the climax. The pulse-pounding F-1 scenes are gripping and intense - I'd expect no less from today's bombastic Hollywood effects departments - but the real attraction is the race that goes on away from the track, as two dedicated drivers break themselves in half to one-up a lifelong rival. An excellent, impressive blend of moods that touches many nerves.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Like many Americans, I know next to nothing about open-wheel/Formula-1 racing beyond the Indianapolis 500, so names like James Hunt and Niki Lauda meant nothing to me up until a few days ago. In many ways, I wonder if that wasn't to my advantage going into Ron Howard's 'Rush', a sleek, well tuned film that focuses on the brief, but intense rivalry between these two very different men.Though the film is tightly focused on Hunt and Lauda, I still found it to be a somewhat superficial examination of them. Like the cars they drive, the movie races by at breakneck speed, rarely taking a pit stop. It's a gorgeous looking film that totally immerses you in its time and place, and the performances are all top-notch, but if I had one complaint it would be that it's just a tad too shallow in its observations and characterizations of these two men and the compelling rivalry they shared.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Way more than just a Formula 1 sports film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I liked this film a lot more than I would have anticipated. Sure I knew going in that the two main leads were both brilliant actors - Hemsworth especially has become a recent favourite of mine - but they both exceeded my wildest expectations. They became James Hunt (Hemsworth) and Niki Lauda (Daniel Brühl), down to the smallest of detail, the most delicate of nuance. The 1976 racing season was before my time, but even though I'm just a casual Formula 1 fan, I had heard about it and I knew who these two were. They were such large characters, such giants in their chosen field, that had this film not captured them perfectly, it wouldn't have been half as good as it is now. Luckily Howard's directing and the performances of these two are some of the finest I've seen in a long time.I also really like the fact that Rush is more than just a sports film about racing. It's a character study about two masters of their craft, embedded in deep rivalry. Both of them know that they stand unopposed, except for that one man, who's their polar opposite in both personality and driving style, yet who is just as capable. That's a great setting for a movie and Rush beautifully explores the possibilities given to it. You buy the rivalry and by the time of the final race I found myself at the edge of my seat, even though I already knew the outcome.It's also great how the movie never takes sides. It's not a film about Niki Lauda - even though he was involved in its making - nor is it about James Hunt. It's about them both and about the sport as a whole.To sum it up, I'd say this is the best sports movie I've seen in my life. But it's that because it's more than a simple example of its genre. It's a brilliant character study, an interesting period piece, a gripping drama and yes, at its core, a film with furiously fast cars. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I enjoyed "Rush", as have a ton of other people. As of today, it's #142 on IMDb and it was nominated for Best Picture. While my score of 7.0 is slightly less than the current 8.3, I was glad I saw this film.I was surprised because I thought the film would be very much like the classic race films "Le Mans" and "Grand Prix"--two 1960s films about Formula 1 racing. However, it was very different. These older films focused on the driving itself--and both had amazing camera-work. Additionally, the films seemed much like watching the races yourself (particularly "Le Mans"). However, both films were a bit light on plot. "Rush", on the other hand, had surprisingly little (and slightly underwhelming) race scenes--mostly because this was NOT the focus of the movie. Instead, it was more of a character study of the two drivers, Niki Lauda and James Hunt. How the men were similar and how they were significantly different is the focus of the film.The acting was very good and the film engaging. I could say more but, frankly, the film's been out for some time and it already has more than 350 reviews, so I'll just wrap it up now.PLEASE NOTE: The scenes after the 'big crash' are very hard to watch--particularly those in the hospital. This along with the crudeness of the language and brief nudity make this a film you might not want to show to your kids.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Racing Movie Ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've been to the German Grand Prix and driven the Nürburgring. I've known drivers and racing directors. When Niki Lauda told the BRM guys the car was too heavy, it gave me a chill. When I hung around BRM, they were struggling to develop a new motor. They came up with a contraption called an H-15. It was massive, and it was heavy. The Nürburgring is not just dangerous, it wrecks cars with its dips and rolls. A heavy car bottoms out and destroys its undercarriage, and sure enough...well, so much for BRM. The H-15 was before this story. Obviously, BWM never learned their lesson.Of course, there's the human element. I've often thought that bullfighters and race car drivers are the only successors to the gladiators. The personal and professional rivalry between Niki Lauda and James Hunt reveals the mentality behind men who flirt with violent death. For one it's a means to an end, for the other it's the end in itself. And this is the hub of the story.Rush is the real thing. It is simply the best racing movie ever made. It's a crime that it wasn't nominated for an Oscar.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Now, before I start reviewing, let me just state that I'm a huge F1 fan. I followed this sport since I was 11, and more specifically I followed Kimi Raikkonen since the start of his F1 career. I thought this movie was a great representation of not only the rivalry but of the sport itself. Sure, they dramatised the rivalry between Nikki Lauda and James Hunt. In reality they weren't on each other's throat as they were in the movie. In fact, at one point they were even house mates. But I love the whole message of the movie overall; What Drives You. It is exactly what these drivers are. They look death straight in the eye every time they are on track, and that pushes them to drive to their best. I love this quote by James Hunt in the movie:"Don't go to men who are willing to kill themselves driving in circles looking for normality"The danger, the risks, and ultimately driving is an F1 driver's definition of normality. When you have a passion for something, no matter what happens you just can't stop. F1 drivers has pants full of passion. A lot of drivers had accidents in their careers whether it was a big one or a small one. Some almost led them to their death. On top of my head, I remembered when Kubica flipped over, that was a scary crash. He managed to walk out of it with just bruises and scratches and continued racing. How bout when Massa was hit by a fallen suspension spring and dove head first into the barriers, he injured his head and had a platinum plate installed in his skull. But that didn't stop him from racing when he was well enough. Ralf Schumacher injured his spine. Same story when Lauda crashed. He had third degree burns and still opted to drive even when he wasn't fully recovered. These people don't see any way out of it. Either you go big and win or you don't do the sport at all which is probably equivalent to death for them which is what this movie is about. At the start it might be about rivalry but at the end its what you risk for passion and how much it means to you.By dramatising the rivalry, the movie has come up with characters with completely different personalities. You have Hunt, the brash, aggressive and handsome driver, who is a loose cannon and feeds on the thrill of driving and also on the attention. Kinda reminds me of a couple of drivers in F1 *cough* Sebastian Vettel *cough*. Then you have the straight and narrow Lauda, who is more interested in the mechanics and precision of the sport. He works very close with the mechanics and with the car to optimise his chances of winning. Something that all the drivers has learnt from, you have to know your car and be one with it. He is confident and not afraid to speak his mind, which can make him look like an asshole at times. The movie is not very technical in the sense that it doesn't go very deep into the sport or even about the cars. It mainly focuses on the drivers aspect of it and in a way brings a human touch to the sport. Which is good as the audience does not need to be a fan of the sport to get it. It's not all about the machine and the cars. Its also about the drivers and how much skill they have to acquire to drive at 300 mph. And that's why I think fans love the sport, we respect how much these drivers have to put in and also how much it goes into building a car like that. Its a perfect marriage of man and machine. There was even a slight reflection of the politics that goes on in the F1 world especially when Ferrari was angry at Lauda for not continuing when Lauda thought it was too dangerous.The cinematography is great in this movie. It really gives a vintage feel to it but not overdoing it to make it look artistic. The colours and lighting was executed subtly but perfectly to really enhance the feel of the movie. I was actually very impressed by it. Good job on both the actors but really kudos to Daniel Bruhl for embodying Nikki Lauda. It was as though the part was made for him. I would say overall it was a great film, not only for F1 fans. If anybody has wondered why people love F1, I suggest watching this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A touching movie about two motorsport rockstars</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I do not very often find a film to be worth a 10/10; there's always something that would keep a fantastic candidate at a 9. But with Rush, it was difficult to find that something. It was just terrifically made. And I'm not being a biased gearhead either. Granted, I did not know too much about these two drivers until the movie came out. And maybe there were other highlights from the 1976 seasons that were not included, but that was not the point of the movie. First and foremost, a big shout out to the make-up crew and whoever else deals with the appearance of the actors because what they have done is marvelous. I looked into the way the real Hunt, Lauda, and others looked and there was not much of a difference. I have not seen a documentary type film be so accurate in that respect maybe ever. And the actors. Man, they really knew their characters well. Job very well done. What Ron Howard has done here is expose what really goes on in a driver's mind on and off the track and how he interacts with his competitors. For the duration of the film, the viewer is immersed in the world of Formula 1 and all the drama associated with it. It is impossible to not have your heart beat at an elevated rate and impossible to not develop a connection with the people and the time because everything in the film was very 1970s (at least, what I know of the 1970s), including the clothing and all the technology. All in all, Rush is probably the best motorsport movie I have ever watched and definitely one of the best overall. I was truly touched by the story of James Hunt and Niki Lauda and learned a lot in the process about the history of Formula 1. It is extremely genuine and not one to be missed at all!

		<shortDescription>Thrilling Drama Of 1976 Formula One Motor Racing Championship Rivalry</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the 1970's world of Grand Prix racing, there is an intense rivalry between two top drivers - the intelligent and perfectionist Austrian Niki Lauda, and the charismatic and talented Englishman James Hunt. Things come to a head at the 1976 world championship when both men must come to terms with triumph and tragedy ...I love motor racing and so in many ways this is a dream movie for me, about one of the most famous and shocking seasons in the sport's history and two of its greatest and most iconic stars. Watching it sometimes seems like it's a made-up Hollywood fantasy - the dashing playboy versus the determined fighter, the high-octane competition that goes down to the wire, the troubled star whose personal life falls apart just as his professional one hits its pinnacle, the horror crash halfway through and the resultant fightback. If you were going to write a race car movie this is what you'd do, but astonishingly not only is it all completely true but the movie's real strength is its drama - the depiction of how the events affect the two drivers. When Lauda tells Hunt that watching him win races from his hospital sick bed was the primary motivation for his recovery, he is speaking with incredible honesty, straight from the heart. Here is man whose very essence was to beat everyone and be best in his chosen field, and no amount of pain or circumstance was insurmountable for him. Equally, on a technical level, the movie is an astonishingly beautiful recreation of the period - the cars, the sets, the visual effects, the costumes and every other aspect of the design contributing to an amazingly detailed Formula One time capsule. The recreation of Lauda's infamous and terrible crash at the Nurburgring and its aftermath is astonishingly painful to watch, and the movie documents every detail of the men's often bitter rivalry with incisive drama, humour and precision. Both Hemsworth and Brühl are marvellous in the leads, although for me Brühl is just mesmeric; he strikes an almost perfect balance between impersonating Lauda's unique mannerisms and finding the drama and passion within the man. In many ways it's an unusual two-piece picture which almost forces you to side with one of these heroes, and in my case it's Lauda - his return to racing at the Italian Grand Prix, a mere six weeks after a near-fatal crash and in unimaginable pain his subsequent fourth-place finish is in my view arguably the greatest sporting achievement of all time. Extremely well written by Peter Morgan, with a great jangling tense score by Hans Zimmer, this independent British-German-US production by Working Title Films is one of the best motor racing movies ever made. Filmed mostly in the UK, notably for race fans at Donington, Brands Hatch and Cadwell Park.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When my wife and I first saw the US trailer for "Rush," my wife asked me, "Do you want to see it?" "Well, it IS a 'racing movie," I replied. I have mixed emotions about NOT watching the international trailer, before watching "Rush," because I would certainly have held much higher expectations. First and foremost, "Rush" is NOT about Chris Hemsworth's pecs; nor, for that matter, is it that much about about Chris Hemworth's character, James Hunt. "Rush" is about two extraordinary men's visions of life and their approaches to racing; and, it is viewed from James Hunt's most famous challenger, Nicki Lauder. Lauder is a technocrat; a man who, at least, appears to "know the price of everything and the value of nothing." Hunt is free spirit; one of simultaneously knows the value of everything and nothing. Hunt and Lauder are presented in much the same manner as the two main characters of "Lonesome Dove". Like, "Lonesome Dove," "Rush" is majestic in its presentation of these two lives. "Rush" is poetic in its presentation, absolute precision,from its score, to its cinematography, to its performances to the most both memorable and appropriate score I have heard since "The Good, The Bad &amp; The Ugly".If you have not seen "Rush," watch the international trailer, available on YouTube. This trailer is the perfect encapsulation of the movie. If you still are not interested, don't bother. However, I hope you are as impressed as I with my favorite film of 2013.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very good true-life sporting drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There was a time during my boyhood in the sixties and seventies when I took a keen interest in Formula One racing, but my enthusiasm quickly disappeared when I realised what an appallingly dangerous sport it was; during this period several of my heroes were either killed (Jim Clark, Bruce McLaren, Piers Courage, Jochen Rindt, Peter Revson) or seriously injured (Stirling Moss, Graham Hill). Despite my disillusionment, however, even I could not fail to be captured by the rivalry between James Hunt of Britain and Niki Lauda of Austria in the 1976 season. The events of this season read more like the script of a Hollywood film or of a blockbuster novel than the record of actual historical events. Lauda, the reigning champion, dominated the early part of the season, opening up a big lead in the championship ahead of Hunt, who was regarded as his closest challenger. Hunt won the Spanish Grand Prix, but was disqualified after the race for a technical infringement of the rules. (He was eventually reinstated and his points restored). To add to Hunt's problems, his marriage fell apart when his glamorous model wife Suzy left him for the actor Richard Burton. The drama reached a climax when Lauda was seriously injured in a crash during the German Grand Prix. It seemed that his racing career was over, but only six weeks later, defying his doctor's orders, he returned to the wheel of his car in the Italian Grand Prix. During his absence, however, Hunt had whittled down his lead in the championship, and everything now turned upon the final race of the season, the Japanese Grand Prix. Apart from their love of their sport, the two men had two things in common. Both were from a prosperous upper-middle-class background, and both had defied their families by taking up a career in motor racing rather than in the professions. Both were married to beautiful wives. (Lauda's wife was the socialite Marlene Knaus). In personality, however, they were very different. Hunt was a brash, outgoing playboy and party animal, a lover of the good life and of beautiful women. (Suzy was far from being his only conquest, and his frequent infidelities were a major cause of the breakdown of his marriage. It is, however, perhaps ironic that she left him for Burton, a man twenty years his senior and with an even greater reputation as a hellraiser and womaniser). He started his Formula One career driving for Alexander Hesketh, an eccentric aristocrat and kindred spirit who had founded his own racing team. His aggressive, and often controversial, driving style won him the nickname of "Hunt the Shunt". Lauda was much quieter, a calm, calculating perfectionist who was an expert motor mechanic and knew as much about the technical side of the sport as about the actual driving. According to this film, the two men disliked one another intensely, although the accuracy of this has been questioned. Ron Howard is one of the more versatile directors currently working in Hollywood, able to turn his hand to a number of different genres, including comedy ("The Paper"), the Western ("The Missing") and sword- and-sorcery fantasy ("Willow"). "Rush", like some of his earlier films such as "Apollo 13" and "A Beautiful Mind", is a biographical drama, but is quite different in content to either of those films. Howard is able to elicit good performances from his two leading actors, Chris Hemsworth and Daniel Brühl, who are able to bring out the contrasting personalities of the two rivals. Hemsworth also achieves a remarkable physical likeness to the real James Hunt. As with some other sports, notably soccer, there have been a number of films about motor racing, including some good ones, but no really great ones. (For some reason, apart from "Chariots of Fire" about athletics, nearly all the great sports films seem to be about either boxing or baseball). "Rush" does not quite come into the "great" category, but it is nevertheless a very good sporting drama, with some fine acting and exciting action sequences. 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Review of Rush (2013) - a must see!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you are not into cars and racing, it doesn't matter. Rush, 2013 is a well written tale of two race car drivers at odds with each other, and the viewer will not know who to root for. That is what makes it so unique. It reminded me of a souped up version of the Black Stallion but with cars instead, and two equally ambitious characters who both love to win. It is one of the best movies I have watched this year. It was so intense I was literally clutching my glass of wine! The visuals are amazing, the soundtrack was just perfect for the movie that takes place in the 70's. It also has superb acting! Ron Howard did such a great job directing, and the pace of the movie just flowed naturally and at a good clip! It was exciting, dramatic, and thrilling. The movie is based on a true story and I was so impressed with it that I looked up the added details about the cast, crew, awards because I was just sad that it had ended! Watch it! You won't regret it!</fullReview>

The two main characters were represented superbly by Hemsworth and Bruhl (esp. I cherished their voices and slang). Academy is too bad of not nominating Bruhl for his role in the movie for he was superb.Professional egotism, rivalry and F1 races are nothing short of reality in this. Period tones, fashions and sfx are mind-blowing. The only problem in the whole movie could be with sport violence and few sex/ nude scenes. This movie did teach me two things and they are: good rivals could become good friends and good rivalry in profession help us to improve our career.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had never heard of the actual rivalry of Niki Lauda and James Hunt prior to having watched this movie. However, I now feel compelled to start watching Formula 1 racing or at least do some Wikipedia research. The cinematography and filming of the racing scenes was done in a very vibrant manner. The pistons firing, gears turning, and constantly changing camera angles made the scenes very captivating. Chris Hemsworth did a solid job as Hunt, but I think that Bruhl stole the show in his role as Lauda. The mannerisms and speaking style with the overbite made him the more enthralling character over Chris's Hunt. Olivia Wilde plays a minor role with a very convincing British accent in her limited screen time. This is an excellent movie for both racing fans, and non-racing fans alike.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although this movie is about Formula 1, Nikki Lauda and James Hunt, it can be enjoyed by people who are not into formula 1 and cars. The movie is more about the rivalry between those two and how far someone goes to be better than the other. James Hunt just want's to prove he is the best and when he does he's done with it. Nikki Lauda on the other hand also want's to be the best but he want's to stay the best and will continue to fight for it. He's not there to prove someone a point other than himself and i think with that attitude you can achieve a lot more because he is more motivated to win more often. The movie is very good and i enjoyed it with my whole family.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ron Howard, the master of biographical picture maker. As I know of him, he never failed to transform biographical stories into a movie. In fact, many of his movies are my favourites. This time he picked up a true story of two rivalry formula 1 drivers from the 70s. This biographical sports drama was nothing short in all the aspects compared to his earlier movies. So his legacy continues with a series of masterpieces in his filmography. I am always fond of his works because the mix of sentiments in his movies is powerfully appealing just like I wanted. The emotion tool was very wisely utilized in this movie as well.The races from the movie were shot awesomely with the old automobile models and sets around. It was a perfect direction utilizing this inspiring true story with two great actors. It won't only tells about races but also the inexplicable friendship between them, which is hard to predict as we are not they. As per my observation I did not detect any flaws, especially races were exceptionally shot, totally top- notch. From the fast pace story narration due to the fine editing to background score and visual effects, we must recognize the A1 quality of the production house.This movie portrays about the 1976 Formula 1 season where two new comer drivers from Europe, James Hunt and Niki Lauda are considered the top rivalries to grab the world championship title. So their's stunning entry from lower class race to the big event, the clash between them were exhibited very well. Two equally great drivers with different mantras in their life as well implement in the race track was just mind blowing. The story was told from the perspective of both of them where narration frequently switches.Initially I was not favour to give it a shot. The reason behind it was the Chris Hemsworth, I am not a big fan of his performance. Most of his movies are commercially feel good kind ones so I was a bit hesitated to put my faith in this. And a couple of Ron Howard's last movies as well not like I expected but was just good. This movie completely reformed these two guys and redefined their's capability once again. Regretting for not saw it earlier, but feels good that I did not miss it after all. A highly recommended movie, which was one of the best sports movie from 2013 along with '42'.9.5/10</fullReview>

The cinematography was exceptional, and the score kept the emotions pumped at the right moments, thanks to Hans Zimmer. Exaggerations were present but to a bare minimum and never really interfered with the movie's theme. Brühl's performance somehow reminded me of Christian Bale. The character development was great, the intimacies between the characters were natural and beautiful.Well directed, Well performed, a breathtakingly amazing film!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've been avoiding this 'critic darling'. Seems like the lower end of the nominee spectrum.Be that as it may, this doesn't mandate the dreaded slot on the back burner.At just a nose past two hours, the pacing's fast and smooth.Gravity's place in the Best Picture nominee list is nothing short of laughable. Captain Phillips and Her certainly deserve the accolade, but Rush is better than both of these films.Chris Hemsworth as James Hunt and Daniel Bruhl as the rat-faced Niki Lauda turn in exceptional performances.I love Sir Chemsworth, I gotta be honest.I'll say that Bruhl in the hospital is the slowest portion of the movie. But it doesn't last too long.The only time it got dusty for me was because his wife (Alexandra Maria Lara) seemed to be having a tough time of it. And I felt for her. Boy oh boy did I feel for that fantastic character.Go ahead, call me a 'softy.'Two of the major themes? Athleticism and assholes.I'll never tire of seeing movies with an R-rating. This is a fine example of nudity solely adding to the overall viewing experience.(Censorship's the bane of my existence in case you're unaware.)As usual, Olivia Wilde as Suzy Miller is a bit of all right in this film. She glazes over Hunt's infidelity quite quickly, yes yes? I like her depiction of a strong woman in an nonviolent yet strained relationship.(This illustrates a well-executed, subtle and original character flaw for Hunt. James and Suzy have a magnificent argument midway through.)Did I mention Hemsworth's performance? It's spectacular.Olivia's furiously ascending the ladder of this reviewer's favorite thespians. She solely delights. And I first noticed her in Cowboys &amp; Aliens, which was a hundred times better than anyone wants to give it credit for. Not since Sharon Stone has there been such a great Lady Gunslinger!I'm not sure what else to say about this movie because it's just so spectacularly shot, written and edited. Rush is a visual masterpiece with compelling characters and spectacular direction.The tension's high. The acting's great. The story's enjoyable, informative and fun. What more do you need?See this film!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Based on the true story of the Formula 1 racing rivals brash English playboy James Hunt (Chris Hemsworth) and his tough methodical uncompromising opponent Austrian driver Niki Lauda (Daniel Brühl) during the 1970s.Director Ron Howard has great skills to put together a top notch movie. The racing action is exciting. The 70s style looks good. I love all the cars. Everybody is great in this. I do have two minor problems. I hate most narrations and this is no exception. It is good for exposition but mostly takes the audience out of the movie. However a narration from the real Niki Lauda at the end would be great.The other problem is more basic. The movie follows both drivers equally. Although it's filled with details from both men, it's not as easy to fully commit to either men. A more traditional structure would follow one protagonist and it would be a more compelling story. My personal preference would be to follow Hunt up to the Nürburgring Nordschleife race. Then they could go back to Niki Lauda's story from the beginning showing the other side of the story all the way to the end. That way it would minimize the back and forth and maximize the rooting interest. Nevertheless this is a very solid thrilling movie. It's compelling and well worth the praise that it gets.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ron Howard is back and arguably better than ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on the rivalry between James Hunt and Niki Lauda, Rush is a magnificent movie that will grip the audience even if they have no interest in racing.Nicki Lauda, played by Daniel Bruhl, gave up the chance to manage his family's business back in Austria in order to become a racer. In a Formula Three race in 1970, he meets the flamboyant Brit James Hunt, who is played by Chris Hemsworth. The two develop a rivalry and eventually cross paths in the Formula One. The movie takes place during the 1976 Formula One season, where Lauda and Hunt try to not only win the World Championship, but prove who the better racer is. Along the way, we see that both men are polar opposites of each other. Lauda is a more calculating, vigilant racer who only races because it's the thing he does best. Racing is almost like solving an equation for him. For Hunt however, racing is his passion. He wants to "stare death in the face, and to cheat it".One thing I loved about Rush was that it didn't have a good guy for us to cheer, and a bad guy for us to boo. Both of these men have flaws but in the end, they're human and it really felt like it in the movie. You'll find yourself cheering for Hunt at times and for Lauda at other times.Before the movie was released I saw pictures of the cast and their real life counterparts. I thought that the casting was perfect. They looked almost identical. But I didn't know that the acting would be so good. This movie wouldn't have been nearly as good if the acting was sub-par. We needed to believe that we were seeing James Hunt and Niki Lauda, and that's what we got. If the movie wasn't released in such a stacked year, I think both of them would've got an Oscar nomination.But you need more than good actors and a good premise to make a good movie, you also need a good director who is capable of bringing everything together, and this movie has just that. On his day, Ron Howard is one of the best directors working right now, and he shows why with Rush. The movie looks beautiful. The racing scenes where masterfully captured and along with the great work of Hans Zimmer, you felt like you were right in the middle of the action.All in all, Rush is an outstanding movie. Anyone who appreciates wonderful cinematography and acting, or even just wants to see a good sports movie, should check this one out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Man, we all have been crooning about the great acts in the likes of gravity n American hustle but what is more axiomatic is the true sheer pleasure n the thrill associated with the flick in question,post watching it.. Director Ron Howard who has given us classics like a beautiful mind , to name a few has delivered a directorial take resplendent with tight editing n in the process bringing us a slick, stylishly crafted, intelligently made n high on octane, edge of the seat thriller , accrued by some good confident performances by both the lead actors.. Even though i ain't a racing fan &amp; till now haven't witnessed a single race even on TV but such is the intensity, racy feel to the movie, right from the first scene, that one doesn't even require an intermission.. Though the rivalry shown is guess, a tad exaggerated but who cares with the great view on offer!!! Not to seize any credits from both the lead actors, Hemsworth &amp; Daniel, who as shown later during the end, look quite the champions they have portrayed on screen.. There is the flamboyant, boisterous &amp; carefree maclaren driver, who believes in living life on the edge, making use of every min.available &amp; never abiding by the rules.. Contrastingly, his competitor up next is a German , a boring , serious guy who stops in the middle of a race to avoid any mishaps, after images of his wife appear in his mind.. Who speaks not so fluent English but is a master at his work, knows his machines inside out n is a disciplined types.. Worth seeing is when he ,while driving a borrowed up car is questioned of not being a racy driver, since neither does he possess long hair, nor flamboyant enough to be called one!!! At this he retorts saying that he does not see any incentives /rewards on driving faster!!! Also worthy is the detailing, the picturisation of races, the cars itself, the background score by the famous zimmer.. In fact, the human emotions, fear &amp; risks involved have been explored &amp; presented to us in a never seen manner.. Indeed their rivalry is the highlight of the movie, which prompted each of them to give it their best.. They don't interact much with each other but do look the part ,especially at the end, seen conversing with each other.. It indeed is a great watch, &amp; not only for some cheap action or some racy sequences..</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not an F1 big fan, but loved the movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gripping, fun and really well acted! Entertaining, fast paced, and amazing to think that based in real life events. I remember Niki Lauda's accident when it happened, but never knew anything else about the ins and outs of F1 back then. Made me research online and I could not believe how much the actors resembled the real F1 drivers. The soundtrack was excellent, I watched the credits to see who did it, and of course it was a main player. Highly recommend it for a fun afternoon movie. I would say it could be watched by families, some parts of James' amorous life are a little iffy but disguised enough that young ones would not totally get it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie was simple amazing. Great story not just about F1 sport, but also about rivals, strong fight for win, love, friendship, passion,desire for speed.. It gives some worthy life lessons that you can learn from this movie. Its not just a documentary about two rush rivals, but also two different people, different personalities and their attitude to life. Outstanding! Great cinematography, actors- play, effects, picture.. One of the best movies of latest and perhaps the best of 2013!!! Really worth to see! 2 hours went like 10 minutes.

		<shortDescription>"RUSH" Drives &amp; Delivers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"RUSH" is the incredible true story of Formula 1 drivers Jim Hunt and Niki Lauda in the epic 1976 Grand Prix. The race is exciting on and off the tracks. Directed with precision and heart by Ron Howard, "Rush" runs on adrenaline at 220 miles an hour and the audience is instantly taken on an unforgettable ride. Chris Hemsworth plays the reckless charismatic English playboy Jim Hunt, and Daniel Bruhl gives a spot on performance of meticulous and serious Austrian racer Niki Lauda. The story would be unbelievable if it wasn't true. But Director Ron Howard has brought to life all the excitement of the 1976 Grand Prix complete with the personal stories of Hunt and Lauda. The film is gripping and a visual rush as Academy award cinematographer Anthony Dodd Mantle puts the viewer directly in the driver seat. Hans Zimmer's moves the story in a wonderful and pulsating soundtrack. The drama depicts rivals Hunt and Lauda and the incredible events that lead to the perilous Nurburgring race and finally the Japanese Grand Prix. As each driver accrues points in each race, they reach the dangerous rain drenched final head to head for the championship title. "RUSH" is an exhilarating film between two talented drivers beautifully performed by Hemsworth and Bruhl. The lives and personalities of these two drivers couldn't be more different and yet their respect and admiration for each other and passion for racing formula 1 is palpable. The film is excellent and accurate in its details of the true story and rivalry of Hunt and Lauda. "RUSH" drives and delivers!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is an extraordinary movie that really moves you. While I know most of the hype from the movie stems from Chris Hemworth's appearance, there is far more to the film!There was a strong sense of personality given off my the characters, both of which Chris Hemsworth &amp; Daniel Brühl portrayed exceptionally. And while this may not be the biggest movie the former has starred in, this is undoubtedly one of his best. The characters played the perfect roles in this film.Aside from the characters, the movie lives up to the name of best picture. There's great editing, soundtrack &amp; direction and the movie really delivers that certain "Rush" as it progresses.Amazing film! Would definitely recommend you watch!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best formula movie I've ever seen!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although movie was bit long I didn't feel any boring moment. Languages and all somehow provoked me. It was just so real.This might be little deep but nowadays formulas are so different and this was fantastic experience of human heart.From beginning to the end I was amazed, they don't even get so good shots in real formula-races, that was also one big HUGE feature. No stupid CGI and feeling was strong all along.I don't watch these kind of movies usually they are so boring but this woke me up, like what if you lived your life like every day was the last one huh? To be honest, this was most entertaining film I have seen in years, forget the category if you cant stay awake for few hours because there is no explosions or so then go back to the grad school... Even if you didn't like formulas, driving, watching driving this has something so deep in it that it flows in you. Even if you are bored at the beginning and so "this movie is full of crap" etc. try to watch 'till the end.Totally enjoyable and inspiring! This is how formulas should go even nowadays but they sadly doesn't.10/10 with super experience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You will come away from this knowing more about Formula racing than you ever expected to. They captured the Seventies perfectly in this movie once again. They had made a movie similar to this years ago, and it is funny how the window that Ron Howard has created here actually feel like it is opening to that time perfectly. It is truly impressive how well they were able to give you the feeling of speed, and put you in the drivers seat. There is no fear of motion sickness for you though as the action is all slowed down to a pace that your stomach will be able to handle. The acting is all top notch, and very real, Having the whole story be told from Lauda's perspective gives the whole thing so much more humanity than it would have had from the perspective of James Hunt who only wanted to win, but had no real reason for wanting it. I recommend this movie to anyone, I Enjoyed it quite a bit, and you will too. The action is just enough to not outweigh the very well told, and visually perfect story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No better script than reality</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Originally I planned on not watching "Rush" at the theater, simply because I lost interest into Formula 1 considerably since the Schumacher years. However, finally curiosity got the better of me and I decided to give it a go. Which proved a pretty great choice as Ron Howard's latest movie makes for a very entertaining two hours. I was vaguely aware of the year season 1976, the developments and outcome of the driver championship and Lauda's spectacular crash of course as you get pretty much reminded here every second weekend when you see him being the co-host of current Formula One coverage. Putting Daniel Brühl into perspective to what I see there, I think he nailed Lauda's character and his very own Viennese charm. Of course it's different to compare with Lauda now being roughly 35 years older than in the movie and I was way pretty much born the year Lauda ended his career, but I think he made a good job in portraying him. Aside from all comparisons to what Lauda was really like, he definitely created an interesting character that had your eyes glued to the screen during every scene he was in. It's not surprising Brühl is in talks for his first Oscar nomination and it's nice to see him back so strongly, after I was a bit disappointed by his work in recent years, especially in "Inglourious Basterds" where his performance wouldn't make the top5 of the film despite having a pretty interesting character.While Brühl kinda sways between lead and supporting territory, the movie's clear lead is Chris Hemsworth as Lauda's equally talented competitor James Hunt. In fact, he is around 5 years younger than Brühl, but his character is slightly older. I believe Hemsworth made a couple smart career choices recently and, after thoroughly enjoying the first Thor movie, I'm pretty curious about the second, which comes out soon. His character here is a bon-vivant who loves drinks, ladies and the sweet life, the polar opposite to Lauda's stubborn lone wolf. And these exact opposites are the basis of the film, the reason why it works so well as an intriguing character study of two extremes clashing. Their personalities also reflect directly on the women with them. While Olivia Wilde as Hunt's wife disappears almost as quickly as she entered the picture, Alexandra Maria Lara as Lauda's wife stays there till the end and we see a good portrayal from her as somebody who's attracted to the danger (their first meeting in the civilian's car), but at the same time constantly worried about her husband's well-being and powerless as she can do nothing but hope for the best.All in all, I recommend this film a lot. Really, you don't have to know anything about Formula One or racing in general in order to enjoy it for being a great character study. I haven't seen a full race either in maybe a bit less than ten years and it still made a compelling watch. The motorsports circus is really just the stage for the two protagonists and except very near the end there's not that much racing action included anyway. And when there is, it always comes with an impact on the relationship between the two. But even if it's just the stage, all the scenes at the race tracks were executed very convincingly and I never thought that it's all just make-believe. They also managed to convey the aura of the Formula One from the 1970s that has sadly lost a lot of its charm by now. Howard knew that he had to make a film that appeals to the masses and Formula 1, compared to NASCAR, Indy 500 etc., has never been a sport that created too much interest, why you don't really find American drivers participating that often either. He managed very nicely and it's a great example of a rivalry that pushed each of the rivals to the limit, often in a good way, and occasionally beyond. What I also liked about it is that it definitely ends on a positive note, possibly with the best scene of the movie with Hunt and Lauda meeting at the hangar which sums up their relationship perfectly. Subtle criticism for the other's lifestyle, occasional mindgames, but also respect. It's always nice to go out in style as we usually tend to remember the ending more than everything that was before and, if badly executed, it can hurt the film's overall perception a lot. Not so here. Very well done as almost the whole rest of the movie. With this character clash, screenwriter Peter Morgan succeeds at least as much as with the one in Frost/Nixon.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ron Howard has proved himself to be a dependable director of the biography subject matter with other sturdy accomplishments such as the Apollo 13 drama. Here the subject is racing rivalry, not something that would normally having me rushing to the big screen, but that's exactly where 'Rush' should be seen.The topic here is the rivalry between posh boy and self stylised playboy James Hunt, and the more stoic and conservative Nikki Louder. Their competitive nature on the track was something even I vaguely remember, my mother being a James Hunt fan. He was probably a lot of Mums favourites at the time.Why the film works are largely down to two factors, a really well written script which captures the two contrasting characters brilliantly and makes them jump off the page. Chris Hemsworth is well cast as Hunt, despite occasionally missing the mark on the accent and no doubt the late Hunt himself would have been very happy with the casting, but its the German actor Daniel Bruhl who carries off the colours here with his portrayal as the determined no nonsense Nikki Lauda with a really perfectly pitched performance.You never entirely sure who too root for here, which could have been the film's failing, but its not, as Howard manages to convey sympathy for both his characters in equal measure for your capacity to dislike them. The approach of the characters towards life varies as much as it does to their attitude on the track, and this is the engine of this film. The icing on the cake is the racing sequences. Well realised and seamless from any special effects that may have contributed, by the end of the film you will be griped.It's an interesting, well acted film on a subject that I don't especially care for normally, but this film made me care enough to watch it and I am very glad I did. See while you still can on the big screen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Punchline of movie- Everyone's driven by something. Its a a biographical movie based on professional rivalry of two Formula 1 drivers in 1970's;Austrian driver Nikki Lauda(Daniel Brühl) and British driver James Hunt(Played by Chris Hemsworth).Kudos to director Ron Howard and writer Peter Morgan,direction is crisp and enthralling. Acting is just top notch by lead characters.From human psyche to emotions to passion everything is just in right amount ,never exaggerated. To create a story of real life events and famous people require a talent,never even heard about this two formula biggies ever but characterizations and story is so compelling that for me now Nikki Lauda and James Hunt are more dominating better Michael Schumacher and Fernando Alanso the F1 drivers who i have seen driving and know about.Power of movie is that it seems literally like a biopic as happens with food everything is refined and balanced to create a perfect taste.Racing sequences of 70's are portrayed authentically.Acting almost flawless: Both drivers in reality were pole opposite;Nikki lauda as more serious and unsociable taken to a awesome performance by Daniel Bruhl and reckless James Hunt played By Chris Hemsworth to a new degree of For me one of the best movie of the year till now,many will not agree with me,but its based on real people and as per that frame ,Director had created masterpiece. A fun ride,adrenaline rushing flick,even you are not on driving seat but sweat could be spilled just by sitting in theater seat.No brakes for this movie, acceleration is induced in audiences.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I eat my humble pie Mr. Howard...my apologies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You may wonder what the title of my review means? I think Ron Howard is a brilliant director obviously. However, when I first saw trailers for Rush it did nothing for me. I sort of turned up my nose and thought this was pretty low on the Ron Howard totem pole. I will see pretty much anything in theatres and yet I had no desire to go see this one. For one reason or another that I won't bore you with I ended up at Rush on a cheap night at the theatre. I should have put more faith in Mr. Howard. This was an incredible film. The acting was first rate (Oscar worthy even?) the story was terrific, the action riveting and being based on a true story made it all the more fascinating as it covers what sounds like one of the greatest sports rivalries in history that I had never even heard of. I am not a racing fan, I have never even sat down to see more than ten seconds of a car race and yet this story could impress anyone. This is about two larger than life characters that have this rivalry that leads to this incredible level of respect between them. At times it had a little bit of a Rocky feel to it as many sports films do but it was all around and excellent and very entertaining experience.A big part of that is Chris Hemsworth who literally gives the performance of his young career. Hemsworth was brilliant. Hemsworth was Oscar worthy. Best of all to me he proved he is more than Thor or a pretty face because he was amazing. His cocky and determined James Hunt was one of the best character portrayals I have ever seen. Not to be outdone Daniel Brühl is also extremely good as Nicki Lauda. It sounds like he really nails this portrayal of the former racing champion. The film is somewhat from his perspective and he narrates some of the film. The character of Lauda is fascinating as he has an almost anti-social, mildly autistic vibe to him and yet like Hemsworth's James Hunt you gain such a respect for him as a racer and what he goes through. The chemistry between Brühl and Hemsworth is perfect for the film and both men give A+ performances. The supporting cast are all decent though no one particularly stands out. Thank goodness Olivia Wilde is only given a small role as Hemsworth's wife. Wilde is not a great actress in my opinion and even in her small screen time she comes across as silly though she does alright and their chemistry is decent enough. Alexandra Maria Lara also does decently as Lauda's wife and she manages to do quite a bit in a very small role showing what she goes through as his spouse.Ron Howard is a storyteller. I should have remembered that. He has done some amazing based on real life stories that have been instant classics. Somehow he always knows how to capture the human spirit and the human condition and characters that are as vibrant as fiction. From the drama and emotion to the edge of your seat thrilling races he nails this. He also cleverly manoeuvres his way around showing countless and seemingly never-ending races by highlighting certain aspects of many different races and covering them fairly. Now my loss of a point to him is the adult content in the film. I am not a prude, and I can watch just about anything and it does not offend me. This film did not offend me but was the adult content necessary? No not even close. The gratuitous nudity and obscenities (mostly in the first half of the film) was completely unnecessary to earn an R-Rating. My issue is that it is distracting to a very good story and it also means a certain demographic shouldn't see this and it is a great story in sports history that teens, kids or even adults that don't enjoy that sort of content might miss out on because of the extremity of the R rating. That really disappointed me. Nonetheless this was a brilliant movie that seems to be a little under-rated at the moment which is unfortunate because both lead actors deserve accolades for their performance. Check this one out, you won't be disappointed!! A surprise gem for me that will likely land on my best 2013 list. 9/10 (three 9/10 films for me in the last week...impressive!!)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Rush - *** 1/2* Ron Howard's Rush dissects the 1970's Formula One rivalry between the brash Brit James Hunt and his complete opposite in the cold and calculating Niki Lauda. The film moves at a perfect pace, providing us with insights into both characters while never painting either of them as a villain or hero in the audience's eyes. The film's major success comes through in the development of it's two core characters, and the contrast Howard places between them as competitors. The action sequences are incredibly tense and exciting, and yet they never take precedence over the film's central mission of developing the rivalry between these two great men. The driving sequences involve the audience to the point where we develop an understanding for the kind of utter danger these men put themselves in to live out their dreams, as Hunt says in the film of his car, "It's really just a coffin on wheels."Strong performances from Hemsworth and Bruhl also help drive this thrilling piece of cinema along. Hemsworth certainly impressed me with his brash and overt Hunt, but Daniel Bruhl stole the show for me; his performance conveys the completely mathematical and emotionless nature of Niki Lauda to near perfection. Strong supporting performances from Olivia Wilde and Alexandra Maria Lara as the men's respective lovers also add to the film's momentum.Overall Rush is a thrill ride from start to finish, never getting lost in itself and providing excellent character based action both on and off the track. In my opinion this is Ron Howard's best work to date (yes, including A Beautiful Mind!) and a film definitely worth catching in cinemas while you still can.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rush</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sure, cutting edge is sexy and gets a lot of attention from both critics and casual movie goers?it's easy to recognize and even easier to talk about. However, there is a place for supreme competence and Ron Howard is one of the most supremely competent. But just because he isn't pushing the limits of style or technique?which can sometimes be little too calculated and self conscious?doesn't mean he's not versatile. Consider the impressive Frost/Nixon and his latest effort, Rush?about as far from each other in style and scale as you can get?even if they do share a common theme. Both films are, essentially, about two men, rivals, who need each other in order to reach their full potential and self awareness. Rush is the story of one of the greatest sports rivalries of all time? the battle for title of the best Formula 1 racer in the world. The sometimes friendly, and often bitter, rivalry between Britain James Hunt (Chris Hemsworth) and Austrian Nikki Lauda (Daniel Bruhl), captivated the racing world through much of the seventies, reaching a dramatic peak in 1976. Note here that in Europe, where Formula1 racers are accorded rock star status (something Hunt's overactive libido takes full advantage of), it captivated far more than the racing world?it captivated an entire continent. One of the best scenes in the film shows, in amusing fashion, that for Italian men the only things in the world more exciting than a beautiful woman are a fast car and Formula 1 driver.Jame Hunt, a brash and sometimes offensively arrogant playboy, navigates his McLaren "bomb on wheels" by instinct and guts; Nikki Lauda, a calculating and sometimes offensively arrogant technician, drives his Ferrari by the book, assessing risk and reward like a bond trading statistician. When the car isn't what he wants it to be, Hunt berates his mechanics to make it better; Lauda tells his mechanics precisely what is wrong and how to fix it. Hunt is the charming bon vivant, comfortable in any social situation because he makes it his own; Lauda is an acerbic social misfit with no idea that he repels almost everyone he meets.Daniel Bruhl's portrayal of Lauda transcends the genre, elevating the film to more than just an action-filled biopic. He plays Lauda as humorless, but with a subtle, squashed wryness behind the eyes. It's a nomination quality performance. Chris Hemsworth proves himself to be better than the pretty boy roles he's had until now?much better. This guy can really act. One problem throughout the film is that Hemsworth is just too damn good-looking, distractingly so. The casting smacks of manipulation. It feels as if the film uses every angle to make us like Hunt as much as we dislike Lauda , to the extent of making Hunt overly attractive and Lauda, well, not so much, in order to set us up for self- chagrin when, later in the film, Lauda faces a personal disaster that can invoke only the most profound sympathy. But in retrospect it makes sense?actual footage of the two runs behind the final credits and it turns out that Hunt was strikingly handsome and Lauda.....Howard brings together his standing team of Anthony Dod Mantle, cinematographer, and Daniel P. Hanley as editor?and to good effect?the three work together seamlessly. The colors are bright and saturated (A red Ferrari is a damn red Ferrari) with with almost garish seventies style banners flashing on the screen announcing the location of every race?and there are a lot of races. The film does not want for road action. One of the reasons for going to a race movie is to see racing. Rush delivers, and delivers well. To the credit of Hanley, the scenes on the track are exciting and tense in just the right proportion and show in visceral detail how these machines work and just what they and their drivers are capable of?truly awesome, and not in the pop sense of the word.It's hard to come up with a criticism of Rush. After all, it is a racing movie and a story of a spirited rivalry between two of the best in their field?each a time-worn genre and somewhat limiting in their strict forms ?so it gets a little room for having a few clichés, which it does. But, having said that, it is one of the absolute best of both types. It's fun, it's exciting, there are no slow spots and it's got some really cool cars in it. (Maybe the Italians have their priorities in line, after all.) It's definitely worth seeing, and worth seeing on the big screen?the racing scenes deserve far more than a small screen can deliver.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A thrilling epic that feels alive...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director Ron Howard ('A Beautiful Mind', 'Frost/Nixon', 'Da Vinci Code', 'Apollo 13' etc) doesn't narrate the story of 'Rush' by letting you choose sides through one driver's perspective. In fact, with some adept writing by Peter Morgan ('The Queen', 'Frost/Nixon'), we travel in time to witness the events that lead up to the Formula 1 World Championship of 1976 and the formation of an unparallelled rivalry. Back then, racing wasn't as safe as it now is. It was rather an era when recklessness and flamboyance brought glory to some racers while two of the others on the grid, died every year. In the midst of this, are two men driven by danger; two rivals driven by passion; two legends driven by each other. Ron Howard is renowned for having a keen sense of the idiosyncrasies of his protagonists and here too, he depicts the influence of their personal lifestyles that shaped their racing styles. But where he really excels, is with the rivalry on track. The sheer thrill, excitement and dangers of Formula 1 racing are brilliantly captured as we travel the globe through stormy wet weather with cars screaming across the screen at 170 mph. They called him a loose cannon but his raw talent was unmistakable. James Hunt (Chris Hemsworth) was aggressive on the circuit and foolhardy off it. Being an outspoken, alcoholic casanova was his way of having fun and believed that it was a necessary balance to the challenges of being a risk-taking race car driver. With an independent, small budget team, Hunt moves up from Formula 3 to the join the ranks of the F1 racers, only to meet his nemesis from the past season. The methodical, reserved but often brash and terribly fast Niki Lauda (Daniel Bruhl) enters Formula 1 by buying out a team with his loaned money and engineers his car meticulously to be the fastest man and champion in only his second season. The cool headed and thoughtful Lauda was quite the opposite of the aggressive and impulsive Hunt and therefore, their confrontations are a treat to watch and more often than not, they battle it out on the track. The film's turning point though is the incident at the German GP in Nurburgring (deemed to be too unsafe to race on by Lauda). 6 weeks later, a struggle for survival, the willpower to race again and the hunger for victory, bring the rivals together once more to fight for the title. In the spectacularly soaked Japanese GP, the engines rev up once more and the tyres spin over the track in a thrilling finale to one of the greatest rivalries in sports history.Ron Howard has made his most exhilarating and brilliant film. Peter Morgan's exemplary screenplay and dialogue make the confrontations between the drivers edgy while giving the story some good substance to keep the non-racing scenes interesting as well. Cinematography by Anthony Dod Mantle is quite simply, superb. The close up of rain drops against wheels spinning off the starting grid, the gloomy sun on a stormy race day in Japan, the slow motion effects of the crashes and the point-of-view angles during the races make for some compelling viewing. The essence of Hans Zimmer's background score is the theme of each race being a risk that is only rewarded with a victory. The tone somehow reflects the aggression and tragedy of the rivalry itself and is quite epic upon reflection. The ravishing Olivia Wilde and a well composed Alexandra Maria Lara support the racers on and off the track but the film is completely dominated by the two powerful performances of the racers. Chris Hemsworth is quite a revelation when one simply attributes his noteworthy work to being an angry, strong yet charming superhero. With his aggressive driving, impulsive drive for sex and outspoken brashness, Hemsworth appears well collected and mature to tackle the challenges of being the legendary James Hunt. Among his best scenes is one with some positive argument with Lauda towards the end of the film, where he justifies his lifestyle and his winning ways. While one sees the fun, reckless and victorious Hunt, there couldn't have been a better portrayal of his opposite. Daniel Bruhl has portrayed Niki Lauda in the most remarkable manner. With the prosthetics and speech, Bruhl emphasizes the technicalities and his focus to take racing seriously just as the living legend would. Much more reserved than Hunt ever was, Lauda was a dedicated and disciplined racer for whom mental focus and physical conditioning were key to winning in a well engineered car. Bruhl's performance showcases this keen understanding of Niki Lauda while adding the matter-of-factness to his dialogues. He seldom smiles because when he does, the joke is upon him. In being calculative, his emotion of happiness in love is a loss to him as he considers it a weakness that won't let him risk it all on the track. Driven by the actors' sincerest performances, 'Rush' feels more alive. Peter Morgan's exemplary writing gives the film its exciting moments and Mantle's superb cinematography brings the thrilling intensity of F1 racing on the big screen in epic fashion. Ron Howard pulled in some great talent and added his expertise of characterized drama with a surprising jolt of epic visuals to recreate the magical era of racing in the 70s. James Hunt and Niki Lauda conclude an important point of the story that they are both driven by each other. From their low points to their victories, what kept them going, was their rivalry and their hunger for victory. They often reached a physical and emotional breaking point but there was no margin of error when the championship was at stake. 'Rush' is a grand prize from Ron Howard and should be cherished by fans of Formula 1 racing as well as movie-goers who simply like a tale of triumphant human spirits. - 9.14 on a scale of 1-10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Rush" is definitely one of the best movies of the year and has many strong points to offer - even to those who aren't into motor sports at all. First of all, the acting is simply incredible. Chris Hemsworth performs the slowly dying kind of charming and charismatic pop stars among athletes that doesn't exist anymore in modern motor sports. He portrays a self-confident daredevil, playboy and sex symbol who seems superficial and unsympathetic at first sight but who turns out to be courageous and have more values than one might think. Behind his arrogant appearance is a breakable young man destined to live in the fast lane and die young. Many real persons from that time and especially the real Niki Lauda said that Chris Hemsworth acts and speaks exactly as the real James Hunt did which proves his incredible acting job. His antagonist is portrayed by Daniel Brühl who incarnates a young and motivated man who seems to be an arrogant and bourgeois nouveau riche at first sight but who turns out to be as breakable, courageous and determined as his concurrent. The two main characters are very different from each other but at the same time they have enough things in common to be at eye level during the most exciting Formula One season in history. I think that Daniel Brühl's acting is even better. He had to incarnate a real person that is still alive which is always tough. As a German he had to learn an Austrian accent to speak German and English in a credible way, he had to have the same gestures and he had to incarnate the same temperaments the real Niki Lauda. Thanks to a lot of details and time put into this acting job and many meetings with the real Niki Lauda, Daniel Brühl perfectly succeeded and delivers without the glimpse of a doubt the best acting performance of his career. The thing that impressed me the most was that the real Niki Lauda said that he thought of people being cruel and superficial when they have watched him with disgust or scare after his accident but when he watched this movie he had the same terrified reaction and finally understood why I all people had reacted that way so many years ago. His reaction proves how intense and real this movie is even though a few historical facts are of course exaggerated to put additional tension into this film. Next to the incredibly gifted two main actors who almost have the same screening time and are equally treated in depth even though the story is told by the film character Niki Lauda, one should not forget about a whole bunch of great supporting actors in this movie. There is simply no bad actor or actress in this film.Another strong point of this movie is the way it mixes the incredible true events by using many original settings from museums or archive footage with well integrated cinematographic elements such as an atmospheric soundtrack, intense dialogues and very well done special effects that are not overloaded with cheap effects but that feel as real as the rest of the movie. The camera work is quite perfect as it has a balanced mixture of cinematographic and documentary shots once again.And then there is the story which is highly based on true events. You don't need to be a fan of motor sports to get into this film. The story is about the clash of two very unique and different characters who seem to be antagonists and the roughest kind of competitors at first sight but who turn out to be more similar to each other than they might think. This movie is about competition, sportsmanship and more than all the precious value of life. It's also about the ups and downs that come with success. It's a movie about family values, love and friendship but also about extreme loneliness and despair. Many people don't understand why motor sport athletes are risking their lives for this sport. This movie gives us the answer. This sport is a lifelong dream of both characters and they entirely owe the lives they are living to their successful career. At the end, the movie shows us two very different ways how to deal with the risks of this dangerous job and where to stop playing with fate. This opens an almost philosophical and quite profound perspective that makes this movie something more precious than a simple action film or drama. It inspires you to think of which path you would have chosen as anybody should be able to at least partially empathize with the characters. In the end, I recommend this film to any movie fan. No matter if you are a fan of action movies, biopics, dramas or suspenseful movies, this flick has it all and even more for you and the incredible acting plus the detailed settings are the cherries on the cake. The movie even includes a few humorous scenes, erotic moments but also philosophical elements. It's hard to create a more complete movie than this one but at the same time, this film always feels consistent and never loses track of its clear guiding line. Right now, this movie is worth nine out of ten and time will tell us if this might even be worth the perfect rate. I think this might be the case and hope that the movie will win a few Academy Awards along with the superb crime drama "Prisoners". These two movies are definitely the best of the year until now and the year is almost over. If you were hesitating whether to watch this film or not, you should by now have made your decision to go to the cinemas as long as this film is still there. Needless to say that the great camera work and the impressive sound effects work even better in cinema than at home.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>We were glued to our seats</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>They did a great job portraying the racing scene and catching the atmosphere, complete with 70s cameras and colours. Me and my ladyfriend were kids back then, and we spent those Sunday afternoons glued to the TV whenever there was a F1 race on, so this was a really nostalgic trip too - but the cameras are so much nearer to the cars here, you're inside the action and the angry engine sounds out of a theater PA system really make all the difference - there are moments of pure adrenaline bliss here. It's been a long, long time since I've watched any car race on TV but for my taste, they could have included even more race scenes, they were that good.All the adrenaline can't save a movie if you don't care, but in "Rush", we do. Both leads are excellent; of course Brühl as Lauda has the meatier and more dramatic role and more screen time but Hemsworth did a great job, too. Supporting roles are also good, with special nods to Alexandra Maria Lara as Niki's wife Marlene. There's a 50 minute doc available on youtube about the Hunt/Lauda rivalry and the 76 championship where you can see a bit of real-life Marlene and she really nailed it. What I missed were a few more of the legendary 70s drivers, only Regazzoni has a speaking part, most others only get a few background seconds.I liked Hans Zimmer's music, sometimes he's too foreground for my taste but in "Rush", he keeps it subtle.The real-life story gets a bit condensed for the screen and writer Morgan / director Howard often use a rather coarse brush to paint their characters, but that really doesn't lessen the enjoyment. Highly recommended!</fullReview>

I was watching movies like Le Mans, Grand Prix, Gumball Rally, Vanishing Point, etc. My dad used to be a race car driver, and I love collecting &amp; watching movies. When I heard people saying this was the best racing movie of all time, I thought "It looks good, but have you seen Le Mans or Grand Prix?" Well, after seeing "Rush" last night, it belongs alongside those two... maybe above. THIS. MOVIE. WAS. AMAZING! It was amazing not only for the racing sequences, but was so well acted and well directed. I left the movie theater wanting to buy the ticket for the next showing.

		<shortDescription>One of the best racing movies ever.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The closer you are to death, the more alive you feel. It's a wonderful way to live. It's the only way to drive." James HuntAlthough in the mid 1970's, I was about to begin a satisfying and successful phase of my academic career, I had never heard of James Hunt and Niki Lauda, two world champions of formula one racing. Ron Howard's action biography of the racers and their milieu changes my ignorance in two invigorating hours called, appropriately, Rush, starring respectively Chris Hemsworth and Daniel Bruhl.Rush is one of the best racing movies of all time and rewards my cinematic demands as few biographies have ever done. Beyond the thrilling cinematography that couples the passions of the players with the sound of the engines and colors of the racing cars, director Howard and writer Peter Morgan give their two principals witty lines and restrained emotional confrontations, much as we would expect in real life with small poetic flourishes: "The wind you can feel is me breathing down your neck. Next time, I'll have you." Hunt to Lauda; "Happiness is the enemy." Lauda to his wife.A leitmotif about the value of having enemies ("Trust me: watching you win those races, while I was fighting for my life, you were equally responsible for getting me back in the car." Lauda to Hunt) is expertly woven into the visceral racing story. That theme binds the characters into an unsentimental Apollonian-Dionysian competition that is more graceful than bitter. Even the inevitable clashes with lovers and wives who suffer the life-threatening races are not in the least obtrusive or annoying. In other words, Howard doesn't weigh his film down with clichés, and he doesn't waste time with love interests or the usual significant-other obsessions about the dangers. What Howard does do is to give us a sense of the excitement and danger of arguably the world's most dangerous sport. And then he peppers that action with biography that makes sense but doesn't overshadow the main action.Rush feel like a summer blockbuster that was rerouted to the fall because it turned out to be more than spectacle. Some of the excitement of the drivers is reserved for the audience:"The risk of death turns people on." James Hunt.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What A Fantastic Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A new film by Ron Howard and written by Peter Morgen. I instantly added this into my watchlist when I watched the first trailer and avoided all the other ones, even though I knew some about the story through my brother.The story of two legends of Formula One's rivalry James Hunt and Nikki Lauda in 1976, and I love how the film starts introducing these main characters and the inception of their competition. I also really love how much they've stayed truthful to the true story and showing both sides of the characters, it's not like the usual films to have a bad and a good character and the audience would root for the good one, either of these characters are good in something and bad in other things, and both their weakness and strength are shown here. It's just so interesting to me how these two characters use each other to improve themselves, which is why their race in that season was very exciting,. Great performances by Christ Hemsworth and Daniel Bruhl, particularly Daniel Bruhl, if you watch any interviews of Nikki Lauda, you realize how much he has nailed this role; however, I've never enjoyed Olivia Wilde's performance, she's not terrible here but this is just a personal thing that I can't like it, she definitely looks astonishing and she has a small part, so overall it is fine. Hans Zimmer once again has done a wonderful job on composing the soundtrack, and I love the sound editing, the score and the cars' sound are edited so well and blended together that it doesn't bother or ruin the moments, in fact it makes those scenes better - I really hope it gets some recognition in the award season. I must admit the cinematography is done perfectly, otherwise the race scenes wouldn't look beautiful and exciting. I should mention that I'm so glad that Nikki Lauda himself appreciated the film and its accuracy, a big applause and thumbs up to Ron Howard.Overall, I enjoyed this film and it's one best films are made for this year so far (I'm glad they didn't go to PG13 rating, I think that would kill the tone), definitely check it out in theaters and own it on bluray, I give it 9/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a movie! I am not particularly interested in the F1 or racing sports; nor did I even knew James Hunt. Niki Lauda as an Austrian bloke I knew. As I toddler I have seen him on TV and described all F1 cars as "Niki Lauda".With the director, the cast and the trailer I had huge expectations and I wasn't disappointed. The script is great, the director does a fine job to get you to the edge of the seat as you watch the racing scenes as well as the strong dialogs.Hunt and Lauda are the most interesting characters since a long, long time. It's refreshing to have heroes not based on a comic! Hemsworth and Brühl do a superb job, Brühl even manages to talk in the viennese dialect of Lauda, which is really really hard(trust me, I am from Vienna and I couldn't do it).The story is a kind of modern Shakespeare drama, with two actors giving us their best performances as actors so far. This movie should get a bunch of Oscars (Director, Music, Sound Effects, Hemsworth, Brühl, Script).Do not miss it on the big screen!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Great Movie for F1 Fans and non-F1 Fans</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was waiting for this movie to appear for several months, ever since it was mentioned in Road &amp; Track magazine.Really the only 2 great racing films are, in my opinion, John Frankenheimer's Grand Prix (1966) and Steve McQueen's LeMans (1971).This movie makes 3.I do like Senna that came out in 2010, but in my opinion it's more of a documentary on the late racing great Ayrton Senna.So 40 years later comes another racing movie. The difference between this move and the previous 2 is that racing is really a backdrop to the clash of 2 very different personalities who came to respect each other.In one professional interview with Niki Lauda the UKs Guardian I believe, it was suggested that Hunt was Lauda's foil - I agree but if it is possible from a screen writing perspective Lauda was also a foil for Hunt.It has been said that the film highlights Lauda - I don't agree - it highlights the both with their contrasts.To me - even more than Lauda's brilliant driving, I will always remember him for his courage after his accident (hardly a spoiler alert since this is common knowledge).In Road &amp; Track's interview with Ron Howard, Howard detailed the effort that he went to insure that this was an accurate portrayal - consulting people directly involved from Lauda himself to Ron Dennis and a dozen others.It has, from what I understand, been well received in the F1 community.Above all it is a fantastic film on 2 very different personalities and how they came to respect each other.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Chris Hemsworth stars as James Hunt and Daniel Bruhl (whom you may remember as the lovestruck Nazi soldier in Inglourious Basterds) as Niki Lauda, two Formula 1 race car drivers in the 1970s who had a fierce rivalry. It's the classic clash of psychologies setup: Hemsworth is a fun-loving womanizer who races for the thrill, while Bruhl is the strict disciplinarian. There's nothing really surprising or deep about this movie, but, my lord, is it excellent. It's just a great example of straightforward, Hollywood filmmaking, perfectly put together in every way. The racing scenes are exhilarating, but it's really the great lead performances that impress the most. You almost have to hate Hemsworth. How can anyone be as handsome as he is and as good an actor? Bruhl gave perhaps the most undervalued performance in Inglourious Basterds, and this movie proves he ought to be a huge star.</fullReview>

I thoroughly enjoyed it from beginning to end.My only minor complaint was the expensive D-Box seat I paid for should have 'gotten busy' when playboy 'James Hunt' was with the stewardess in the airplane bathroom.

		<shortDescription>Rush finishes in the top spot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rush This is a film review and there not any plot spoilers.I went to see this film and had no idea what to expect. I knew Ron Howard could direct a great film, and I knew Chris Hemsworth is perfect for the role of the god of thunder, but beyond that I had done little to prepare for this film besides watch the TV spots; I did not even watch a full trailer. I was amazed and taken aback by how much I enjoyed this film, it is a film that grabs you quickly and keeps you tied to it the entire run time. To keep things spoiler free I will be very brief about the story, this film is just as much, if not more, about being a man as it is formula 1 racing. It follows two drivers as they try to figure out how to be successful men in the world, through wins, losses, women, marriage, drugs, anger, and gaining and losing control. This is what makes this film so engrossing, the film takes us deep into the lives of two drivers and focuses and explores so much more than just their racing. However, the racing in this film is some of the best I have seen depicted on camera. The cars are loud, very loud, and at times you think you can feel the heat off the engine, or the body bend under the pressure. The camera effortlessly switches from all angles during the race and it does it well to try and give you the full experience as if you were at the race. The real bright spot of this film is the acting. All give astounding performances. Chris Hemsworth and Daniel Bruhl present these men with full, nuanced, careful, and honest performances. It would have been very easy to let the style and tone of the film drift off the track with inflated and overacted performances but both men fire on all cylinders and hold tight lines the entire film. Olivia Wilde is smart and memorable with her screen time, and Christian McKay fills a very important role in the film and does so splendidly. There is something very tangible about Rush, it is based on a true story, but it goes deeper than that. This film is an adrenaline rush in and of itself, but it is also very humanizing. This film is definitely not for the fast and furious crowd, but that's another reason that it is so great, it has fast cars and yet a story that is emotional and worth exploring. Add up a great script, good directing, and stellar acting and you get a film that drives just as fast and true as the cars you see on the screen.

		<fullReview>When I saw the trailer my expectations for this movie were not so high, I thought it was going to be one of those money-maker trashes.I was totally mistaken.Rush shines in everything, the direction by Ron Howard is splendid, every race scene was beautifully done. The acting by both Hemsworth and Brühl is one of strenghts of the film as they portray their characters perfectly, they transmitted what they wanted to show to us, I expect some awards for these two interpretations. The sound mixing and editing is great also, and I have to include the soundtrack by Hans Zimmer as one of the best things of the film. I never felt like the movie was 2 hours long. By the last minutes I thought my heart was going to explode, I was excited.This is more than a movie about racing, it's sublime, one of the best films of the year so far.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Closer You are to Death</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Greetings again from the darkness. Director Ron Howard and writer Peter Morgan are back in their wheelhouse with a film based on real people. Their previous collaboration was Frost/Nixon, and they also had separate "true stories": Howard with Apollo 13, A Beautiful Mind and Cinderella Man, and Morgan with The Queen and Last King of Scotland. Here they tackle personality opposites and fierce Formula One competitors James Hunt and Niki Lauda.The two lead actors are perfectly cast. Chris Hemsworth (Thor) slips seamlessly into the swashbuckling, rebellious playboy that was Great Britain's James Hunt. Daniel Bruhl (Inglourious Basterds, Goodbye Lenin!) becomes the focused, determined, meticulous Spanish-German Niki Lauda. You might think of Hunt as an X-Games type who thrives on publicity and fun, while Lauda is more scientist or engineer driven by the quest for perfection. Both were World Champions and their rivalry brought out the best in each.Do not think for a second that you need be a Formula One expert or even know the backstory of Hunt and Lauda to enjoy this movie. It is extremely entertaining and exciting. Morgan's script might hover a bit more on the oh-so-photogenic Hunt/Hemsworth character, but it also does a nice job of preventing the not-so-likable Lauda from being a bad guy. In fact, it demonstrates that champions are not all alike.The look of the film is exemplary. Beautifully photographed by DP Anthony Dod Mantle (Oscar winner for Slumdog Millionaire), the colors and grainy texture make this look like it was filmed in the 1970's, not just based then. While the racing scenes are stunning, it is actually an intimate look at this world and the men of this era. Without dwelling on it, we get a realistic feel for the fiery crash that caused Lauda's horrific injuries and his extraordinary fight to recovery while in the hospital.We also get a peek at the very different marriages of these two men. Hunt's short lived bond with model Suzy Miller (played by Olivia Wilde)ended when her affair with Richard Burton caused the final split between Burton and Liz Taylor. Lauda's relationship with his wife (Alexandria Maria Lara) occurred without the whirlwind, but in a very real and organic manner. Both are an additional touch of realism to a quite real story.There have been no shortage of racing movies over the years. Some good: Le Mans (Steve McQueen) and Grand Prix (James Garner). Some not so good: Days of Thunder (Tom Cruise) and Driven (Sylvester Stallone). Ron Howard's latest clearly finishes near the top at the finish line.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rush, The Movie: Personal Review of an Exhilarating experience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had zeroed in on Rush as one of the movies that I was going to watch on the big screen (the Ron Howard &amp; F1 union factor), here in Dubai and was waiting for it eagerly. And boy it was the worth the wait. Rush is not your run-of-the-mill movie in the sporting drama bandwagon which caters only to F1 enthusiasts.F1 fan or not, the way Howard has showcased the legendary rivalry between F1 greats, Niki Lauda and James Hunt makes for compelling and intense viewing. The banter and the doses of humour interspersed throughout the flick form the crux of the "foe-mance" between Hunt and Lauda (played exquisitely by Chris Hemsworth and Daniel Bruhl respectively) &amp; are the high points of film. Howard is spot on with his depiction of the events surrounding this fabled rivalry. His portrayal of the 2 legends, with contrasting personalities who are poles apart and yet are driven by equal love for the sport and ambition makes the flick, an interesting and exhilarating ride. The movie is crisply edited and moves along at just the right pace for a biopic.Apart from all this, in my opinion, ultimately what clinches it for Rush and catapults it into the "bench mark" shelf of movies; making it one of the great sporting drama movies of all time, are the parts just before the climax and the climax itself. The miraculous &amp; awe-inspiring recovery of Lauda(after the life threatening crash in Nuremberg) culminating into the final race of the dramatic 1976 season in rain soaked Japan(with the stunning Mount Fuji in the backdrop) has been shot and executed "jaw-droppingly" well. It's a spectacle to say the least. Expect cinematographer, Anthony Dod Mantle to win a few accolades for his staggering work, as Howard's team on the whole excels in executing &amp; pulling off breath-taking F1 set-pieces to perfection.In Rush, we have a film which Ron Howard &amp; his team have managed to steer just about correctly at every corner/chicane of movie making. The flick has almost everything, right from the movie score to the acting, working for it, like a well drilled F1 car. In the end what it all boils down to; the essence of Rush, the movie, lies in its two protagonists. It's thrilling, funny and unpredictable just like Hunt and meticulously filmed, is blunt but with touch of emotional and inspirational edge to it just like Lauda.Formula 1 buff or not Rush to the nearest movie theatre to catch this un-missable adrenaline edge of the seat ride.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A memorable cinematic experience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rush is one of the best films of 2013, hands down. With phenomenal storytelling, prefect direction and near flawless acting, it submerses the audience into a the F-1 Racing world circa 1976. The film showcases the bitter rivalry of James Hunt and Niki Lauda, the most memorable of the sport. Chris Hemsworth and Daniel Brühl were near perfect in this film, due to the fact that the audience is meant to view these people as both protagonists. It delves into the morality of both characters, not showing one or the other as a villain or a hero, just regular and ordinary. With the help of Ron Howard's direction, this film elevates the intensity of this rivalry with getting riveting performances from the entire cast all around the board. However, the real shining star of this film is Daniel Brühl. Brühl gives the performance of his career in this film. And I fully expect an Oscar nomination for him this year.Despite being about racing, Rush's best scenes are rich in texture and performances, rather than visual effects. By far the best parts of the film were through the characters and that is what Howard intended. While the racing sequences are high octane scenes, the smaller parts are what really shine throughout the film, even if it ever gets to feel too long. Its interesting as hell and a very entertaining watch. Rush is one of the best films of 2013, delivering Oscar caliber performances along with impeccable writing and direction, it stands as a heavy handed Oscar contender.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is not about racing. It is about two men. That are very different. And that they are really wanted to beat one another. Back in the 1970s and when Formula 1 racing was in it's hey day!Two racers and men. With different attitudes and different approaches. One a playboy and extroverted. Another an introverted and only cares about racing and none of the limelight like the other does.Chris Hemsworth sheds the Thor image and proves his acting chops as cocky, arrogant, playboy but brilliant racer, James Hunt. As he has the British accent and look of James Hunt. Daniel Bruel from the movie "Inglorious Baste*ds" and the upcoming movie about Wiki Leaks. Shines from the supporting role to the front as Austrian racer Niki Lauda. Who is smart and brilliant too. But also is more introverted and shy than his UK counterpart.These two share an intense rivalry that almost goes into hatred. But when Lauda gets hurt. And nearly killed. It takes him over a month to recover and to go back in the race.If you know what happens in the end for those that lived in that era or followed the men, but for those that don't and are only learning from this movie. Won't spoil the ending but it is pretty bittersweet.Both men do a great job in acting and emotions. And the supporting cast is really great. Olivia Wilde as Hemsworth's wife whom he was married briefly really has come into her own. And will have a blossoming movie career as well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Being a fan of Ron Howard as a director, I would say his best films are his historical dramas such as Frost/Nixon, A Beautiful Mind, Apollo 13, and Cinderella Man. You can now add his newest film, Rush, into that group.James Hunt (Chris Hemsworth) and Niki Lauda (Daniel Brühl) are both Formula One race car drivers with wealthy backgrounds. Hunt has proved himself to be a hard working and winning driver. Hunt is a Brit who has a habit of vomiting before every race and is a well known drinker and ladies man. Lauda first bought his way in to being a driver in the Formula Three circuit, and is a technical genius who knows what works best for the cars he races. Hunt and Lauda meet after a Formula Three race where both of their cars spin out of control and Hunt eventually wins the race. Immediately, they don't like each other. Both of them go their separate ways, only to meet again when they each join the ranks of Formula One. Hunt lands a deal to race for McLaren, while Lauda buys his way into a team that races Ferrari's. The film's primary focus is on the 1976 season, and shows us what Hunt's and Lauda's lives were like on and off the race track. Hunt is seen as a ladies man, who settles down with Suzy Miller (Olivia Wilde), while Lauda meets Marlene Knaus (Alexandra Maria Lara) at a party she is ditching. Both racers are very competitive of each other, but don't necessarily have hatred toward each other. They do trash talk to each other, and do their best outdo the other.Ron Howard's direction of this story, is crisp, rapid, and makes some nice choices that make Rush a very exciting film. Howard is great at showing us various shots of what's going on and gets very creative with the camera. Howard does a great job at keeping us interested in the lives of James Hunt and Niki Lauda. Howard also gets excellent performances from his cast. Peter Morgan, who previously collaborated with Howard on Frost/Nixon, delivers a fast paced and crisp screenplay. I like how Morgan managed to make the script feel like a race in itself when combining Hunt's and Lauda's stories.The standouts from the cast of Rush are the two leads, Chris Hemsworth and Daniel Brühl. Hemsworth excellently portrays James Hunt as more than a drinker who parties and hooks up with the ladies. Hemsworth makes Hunt to be a man determined to win and is ambitious to be the best. Chris Hemsworth gives the best performance of his young career. Daniel Brühl also gives the best performance of his career. Brühl shows Niki Lauda to be a sophisticated and knowledgeable driver who knows his cars. Brühl is also excellent at showing a man who wants to win, but eventually knows when to stop racing.Rush also has a lot of great technical aesthetics to it. One of them is a lot of very unique shots captured by DP Anthony Dod Mantle. Mantle does best at getting the races shown and things happening in the cars and especially point of view shots from the drivers' eyes. The editing by longtime Howard collaborators Dan Hanley and Mike Hill is fast and well put together to tell the story. The makeup department does an excellent job with making Daniel Brühl look like the real Niki Lauda. The music by Hans Zimmer is fast and electric and makes the races more exciting. The sound department does an excellent job of putting together everything, from the actors' dialogue to the music and the sounds of the cars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rocky vs. Rocky. The audience wins.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Most sports movies involve an underdog trying to defeat an established champion. We've seen a million variations of Rocky Balboa taking on Apollo Creed. But what if someone made a film about Rocky fighting another Rocky? That's what director Ron Howard has done with his excellent new racing movie, "Rush." The most compelling aspect of this tale of two long shots is that it's not the invention of a screenwriter. It actually happened. The drama centers on the rivalry between two drivers, James Hunt and Niki Lauda, and the movie follows each man's unlikely rise to the top ranks of the Formula One circuit. The heart of the action takes place during the dramatic 1976-racing season during which the British Hunt and the Austrian Lauda vied for the world championship. They both overcame enormous adversity and risked their lives for the chance to win it all. Danger is a major theme hovering over the story, as the potential for death lurks around every turn of track. In this era of racing, an average of two drivers were killed each year.Howard seems to be at his best when he's telling true stories ("Apollo 13," "A Beautiful Mind"). The Academy Award winner here re-teams with his "Frost/Nixon" collaborator Peter Morgan, a screenwriter who also specializes in films based on real events ("The Queen, " "The Deal"). Howard and Morgan resist the urge to embellish the story for dramatic effect, unlike some other filmmakers (I'm talking to you, Ben Affleck). The great script is paired with stunning visuals. Howard immerses us in the racing scenes. Cinematographer Anthony Dod Mantle's cameras put us on the course, on the cars, behind the wheel and even inside the engines. The track sequences demand to be seen -- and just as importantly, heard ? in the theater.But the drivers themselves are the reason we want to go along for the ride. The two competitors could not be more different. Hunt, the charismatic, womanizing playboy, is played by Chris Hemsworth (Thor), while Daniel Bruhl plays Lauda, the quirky mechanical savant who has a way with machines, but not with people. Both actors create engaging portraits of the respective drivers, but Bruhl's performance is the one that will no doubt generate awards buzz.Audiences, however will root for both men. Neither is the villain. The intense competition pushes each man to excel beyond what they would have otherwise achieved. They make each other better. It's Sosa vs. McGwire, only with spark plugs instead of steroids. The only shame is that one of the men had to lose.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>one of the best sport movies ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>**might contain spoilers**I went to see this movie having absolutely no idea about F1 or about James Hunt and Niki Lauda. and i was amused so much that i didn't feel the 2 hours at all !!! i screamed, laughed, got scared and felt the rush all to the extreme.perfect directing, screenplay writing, acting, music, costume design and everything &lt;3 the main two characters were so different yet you fall in love with both of them. the director Ron Howard and both Chris Hemsworth and Daniel Brühl make you feel every moment like you are with them in it.It is really rare to see a true story movie without Hollywood alterations. if you see the BBC documentary (almost an hour long) of the rivalry between James Hunt and Niki Lauda you would agree that the director Ron Howard and the writer Peter Morgan succeeded to represent the story as it is (the crash, the interviews (for example when a reporter asked James Hunt how are extremely fast? he said big balls !!), the party scene (same atmosfere, same place, same attitude by James and Niki) !! everything was identical !! also Chris Hemsworth and Daniel Brühl played both characters as if you were watching the real documentary. definitely one of the best movies of this year.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yet another masterpiece. He is a true genius. Apollo 13, the beautiful mind, Cinderella man and now rush.. So well crafted,you will never want more.Rush gives you the extra bit of rush that you have always wanted in life. Lauda is superb and so is hunt. The rivalry depicted is awesome. I have always felt chris hemsworth is very underrated and as he clearly says he is not just a party boy but much more. Both of them have completely different perspectives but Howard justifies both of them so aptly. I really think how hard it would have been to recreate formula one in the 70's but he has done it perfectly. senna,prost hunt,lauda...great people to look forward to.

		<fullReview>Rush has all the right qualities a movie should have to succeed. An amazing story-line, some very good performances, brilliant direction and a decent soundtrack.On my way to see the movie I was expecting to see Driven 2.0. I was pleasantly surprised since it turned out to be so much more. The attention to the detail they've shown in the movie is truly spectacular thus completely capturing the world of Formula 1 at the time. The way the two drivers' worlds collide with each other is portrayed spectacularly without any of them stealing the limelight for himself. We're presented with two equally dramatic stories of determination, arrogance, love and above all speed.Where this movie really steals the show though, it's the way its characters seek redemption. Both Niki Lauda and James Hunt are not looking simply to win. They're trying to conquer their darkest fears and to prove to themselves they're more than a man ever hoped to be. The opening minutes of the last race is a work of art as well.Overall that was a perfect sports movie. It gets a 10/10 in the sports category and a 9/10 on ordinary voting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Delivering white-knuckle F1 thrills and compelling drama, this true story of two larger-than-life racing legends is gripping, poignant and exhilarating through and through</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No motion picture in history has so accurately portrayed the anxiety, thrill, elation and perils of competitive motor racing as Ron Howard's excellent 'Rush'. A gripping drama based on the real-life rivalry between Formula One adversaries James Hunt and Niki Lauda that culminated in their history-making bout for the 1976 world championship title, it has the very rare honour of being a sports movie not just for fans of the sport itself, but a celebration of a universal need within every individual for purpose and achievement.That need is exemplified in the two duelling, diametrically opposite individuals at the heart of the film. Hunt (played by "Thor" star Chris Hemsworth) is a British playboy who loves the game for the chance again and again to live life dangerously close to death, the epitome - if you will - of a stereotypical F1 driver who lives and drives recklessly and fearlessly. Lauda, on the other hand, is a methodical tactician, constantly assessing the odds and "looking at the big picture", careful and calculating where Hunt is careless and cavalier.Their approach to the game isn't all that sets them apart; while Hunt is sexy and charismatic, Lauda is often terse and brusque. While Hunt hits the parties and downs the booze the night before and the night after every race, Lauda avoids these excesses, and cares nothing for hanging out with his team members to build camaraderie. The only thing they have in common is their family background, both racers hailing from distinguished families that did not support their racing dreams, a fact elaborated in greater detail in Hunt's case to illustrate the conservative Viennese upbringing that likely contributed to his chilly personality.Neophytes as we are to F1's history, that we are able to learn so much about Hunt and Lauda is credit to Peter Morgan's character-driven screenplay, which devotes an extraordinary amount of attention to fleshing out both personas and allowing his audience to draw out the obvious contrasts between them. This isn't a film where the only thing that matters is what happens on the race track; rather, Howard emphasises the fundamental differences between these two men, which makes their race on the track a battle not only for glory but one stemming from their divisive personal values and beliefs - and as we learn, the reason why either one eventually develops fierce mutual respect for the other.But before we get to that turning point, Howard recounts in largely chronological fashion their beginnings as brash newcomers in Formula Three racing and their ascent into the big F1 league. The briskly paced setup that covers Lauda's strategic entry into the Ferrari team by his mechanical ingenuity, as well as Hunt's more rocky start under the eccentric Lord Hesketh (Christian McKay) and subsequently Team McClaren, uses these key events to ratchet the tension between Lauda and Hunt, building up of course towards the seminal 1976 F1 racing season where their acrimony reaches its climax.Confidently allowing the drama to take centrestage for the first half of the movie, Howard leaves much of the race action for the latter half of the movie as the 1976 season gets underway. The highlight of it all is of course the dramatic centrepiece at the Nurburgring track in Germany - also known as 'The Graveyard' - where Lauda will be trapped in his burning car for close to a minute and suffer third-degree burns to his head and lungs. Those who know the story will also remember that he will get back on the track an amazing 42 days later, and Howard spares no detail in showing his extraordinary tale of tenacity - including the agonizing medical procedure of vacuuming his lungs he had to endure.It all pays off extraordinarily in an exceptionally thrilling and yet deeply poignant finish set around the Fuji Speedway amidst pelting rain. A quick search online will probably tell you what happened during that race, but we advise those who yet know the story to let Howard's film have the honour of taking you out on that breath-taking final race of the season that provides beautiful closure to the running theme of just what and how we choose our lives to be driven by. It is also by far one of the most emotionally intense cappers we have experienced this year, a perfect combination of Howard's masterful direction, Anthony Dod Mantle's expert cinematography (that uses compact digital cameras mounted within the cars to bring his viewer right into the heat of the action), and deft editing of hundreds of shots from various perspectives.And yet this remains through and through a story built on two fascinating characters, which Hemsworth and Bruhl nail with adroit precision. Best known for being 'Thor', Hemsworth brings impressive depth to a character that could easily have been cartoonish, balancing on a very thin fine line bravado and vulnerability to rise above caricature. German actor Bruhl shines in his first Hollywood role (he'll next be seen opposite Cumberbatch in the WikiLeaks drama 'The Fifth Estate'), and besides exuding determination and poise at every turn, he also brings a rough charm to his character.With 'Rush', Howard once again asserts himself as a maestro of smart adult-oriented entertainment built on complex but always compelling real-life characters. It easily stands out as one of his best, and the same can be said of Morgan, their second collaboration since 'Frost/ Nixon' paying off in a truly amazing film that is gripping at every physical turn on the track and every dramatic turn off it. Combining larger-than-life characters with white-knuckle racing thrills, 'Rush' Is not just one of the best sports movies we have seen, but indeed one of the very best films that you'll see this year.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Rush is a biopic about the rivalry between F1 racers, James Hunt and Niki Lauda. Their story is pretty much known as remarkable and their personal character can also be worth looking. By looking at the filmmaking, you'll see that it's an ambitious piece of cinema full of style and fascination beneath the lives of these people. However, it picks some mainstream choices in its character study. Well, there's no denying that you'll call Rush a very well made film. The direction propels the storytelling, making it wholly entertaining, while the performances made the less faster scenes a lot gripping. I think those merits alone would already make Rush a great movie.The film contrasts between Hunt and Lauda by their traits and goals. Hunt is all brawn while Lauda is all wits. Though they both have the same obsession of winning mostly by their pride; one seeks for more fame and excessive pleasure, while the other tries to prove that he still got integrity even in the life as a star. The interesting part here is how these obsessions make them rise and fall, but that is the only thing where the character development leads to. The rest depends on the compelling performances filling the personalities and fortitude of these people. Chris Hemsworth did what he does best as a charming arrogant man, and it seems that's perfect enough for James Hunt. Daniel Brühl immediately steals the show, outweighing every acting around here. He's simply emotionally gripping as Niki Lauda.Above all, it's all about the craft. Ron Howard brings plenty of fortitude and thrill through the dangerous racetracks, while makes the rest so terribly engrossing. The film is also magnificent in production with all the props, cars, cinematography, and stuff. But the real deal here is the style, showing consistent speed in its editing through the camera angles. These skills simply made the overall film thoroughly entertaining.Rush can be worth rooting for in the end, it's a very well told story that embraces the speed of the cars without repelling anything, but when it slows down, it's still an interesting movie for exploring the characters, if only that part was less conventional, it would have been a lot stronger. But the strength is already kept strong by the filmmakers behind this film. It's just a marvelous experience that many would definitely find it engaging. It's easy enough to recommend it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Awesome! Gripping, cool, authentic &amp; dramatic, this movie has it all.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was the movie I have been looking forward to watching all year, if not longer, from when I first heard it was being produced a year or so ago during Formula 1 coverage. When I first heard about it, I didn't have the greatest of hopes, worrying that Ron Howard wouldn't portray the sport correctly, or do it a disservice, but after seeing various interviews &amp; him popping up at various events throughout the Formula 1 calendar, I was starting to go along with the hype &amp; was in no way disappointed. This is the best movie I've seen this year. I was gripped from start to finish. It really had it all, from the authentic racing perspective, to the drama on track &amp; the off track lives of both Hunt &amp; Lauda, being portrayed excellently. This is the first film I've seen in a while where I can see myself watching this over &amp; over again in the years to come.The movie is based on the unbelievably true story of James Hunt (Chris Hemsworth) &amp; Niki Lauda's (Daniel Brühl) rivalry during the 1970's in Formula 1. The story follows their starkly contrasting lifestyles both on the track, as well as in their personal lives off the track. James Hunt is your charming English playboy, living every day like its his last in both his driving and his party going lifestyle, whereas in contrast Niki Lauda is the consummate professional, having that extraordinary ability to know exactly what's required to get the utmost performance out of his car. They both push each other to strive for the world championship, to outdo each other, from their Formula 3 days in the early 1970's to the dramatic 1976 Formula 1 season.I don't believe there are enough superlatives to describe this movie, from the fantastic cinematography &amp; the staging of the racing scenes. Yes there is a bit of use of CGI, but strip that back, there were real stunt drivers driving the real cars, with cameras mounted in ideal positions to get great shots. Even both Hemsworth &amp; Brühl both entered into driver training to prepare for their roles, which added to the authenticity. I think Ron Howard nailed this, from the look of the cars, to capturing the spirit of 1970's Grand Prix. I was especially impressed with the detail in the sounds of the cars. You can tell it was crafted to hear the sound from the drivers perspective during shots focused on the drivers. You top off all this with an incredible story, which is even more impressive that its based on a true story.I really felt gripped throughout the movie, from the highs of the racing and the rivalry, through to the excruciating pain Lauda went through on his recovery, I really felt like I felt every emotion, good or bad throughout the movie. This is an incredible movie and I'm sure even if your not a Formula 1 fan, or even a sports fan, you will find something in the drama of the legendary rivalry between Hunt &amp; Lauda, that is Rush!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best racing movies out there.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me start by saying that this is an excellent movie, based on a true story. So, all the F1 fanatics out there, including me, should forgive various improprieties. Yes, there are a few of those, but the film as a whole, portrays in a vivid manner all that made F1 racing so great in the '70s.Some of the unrealistic facts that caught my eye: - Hesketh, as a Team, did not pull out from F1 at the end of 1975. James Hunt simply left them for a better team. - The driver that was killed during Watkins Glen GP 1975, is Francois Cevert and was not decapitated. - Nurburgring 1976. Lauda did not lose his helmet and no driver was hurt in the qualifying session, before the race. There are a few more, but Ron Howard managed to knit those events so nicely in the story, that you could pretty much believe that things happened that way!Another area that really impressed me, was the resemblance of the actors to the real people and the amount of work that went into Daniel Brühl's make up, in order to make his scars look the same like Lauda's did, after the accident. It is really amazing!In conclusion, everyone can enjoy this film, no matter how much into F1 he/she is. But you have to remember one thing, this is not a documentary, it is a movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There's been a lot of hype surrounding Academy Award winning director Ron Howard's newest venture into the world of Formula One racing starring Chris Hemsworth and Daniel Brühl. It's safe to report that "Rush" from Universal Pictures is a thrill ride that will leave you entertained from moment one. Telling the dual stories of rival racers Niki Lauda (Brühl) and James Hunt (Hemsworth), two polar opposite personalities and their appreciations for the sport are put in the forefront by screenwriter Peter Morgan.Off the bat, one of the greatest takeaways from the picture is how confident Ron Howard has become as a director. He handles this sport and story with perfect execution, knowing exactly how he wanted to tell the story. He's never been as stylistically profound as he's been in this film. It's his best outing since "Cinderella Man" - a film I found massively underrated in its awards year.The technical team assembled debuts some of their finest works in years. From the first frame, you immediately recognize the power and execution of the Sound team. Polarizing, loud, and engaging, nothing makes the film sing more than aural elements put together. DP and Oscar-winner Anthony Dod Mantle has finally found the right vehicle that not only showcases his unique style but takes liberties and chances that pay off in a big way. It's not easy filming a racing movie, in what feels like 48 frames per second, and have the audience catch everything you're doing along the way. Hans Zimmer is on a roll. After infusing his own style into Superman earlier this year with "Man of Steel" and added tender qualities into the arsenal of "12 Years a Slave," his work in "Rush" is just as impressive and awards worthy for a Original Score mention. Film Editors Mike Hill and Dan P. Hanley cut the film brilliantly. There's a consistent pace that keeps you at the edge of your seat. The editing duo have delivered time and time again in works like "Frost/Nixon" and their Oscar-winning works in "Apollo 13." This stands firmly next to those films.What helps the film move along are the impressive turns by Chris Hemsworth and Daniel Brühl. Two outstanding actors that haven't been given their chance yet to show what their made of in the film world, nail each of their characters beats and motivations that are completely lively. Hemsworth, who has been quite successful in the "Thor" franchises and even dipped into the horror genre in "The Cabin in the Woods," has all the goods as a leading man. Fascinating and layered deep with a silence under the glitz and glamour, James Hunt was a lonely person. Hemsworth illustrates all of it with a light sensitivity and a charismatic nature.Brühl fully understands the mechanics and precise ways of Niki Lauda. The co-leading man is just as charismatic, even when he's unlikable, the character actor who has starred in "Inglourious Basterds" and "The Fifth Estate," displays his abilities when given the opportunity to do so in his own film. Motivating and awkward, Brühl gets what Niki is all about. It's a remarkable turn from the Spanish-German actor.Two things happened when the credits started rolling. The first was I got in my car, which is an automatic Toyota Yaris, and attempted to down shift like a race car driver. "Rush" does for Racing the way "Rocky" did for Boxing. The second was a burned scene in my brain of a lonely James and an apprehensive Niki speaking by an airplane about what they did for each other. A scene that stands as one of the best of the year so far. Where Morgan falters in the middle with weird character rhythms and missed opportunities for a stronger foundation into their lives, he nails some instrumental scenes that makes the film succeed.Read More @ The Awards Circuit (http://www.awardscircuit.com)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am a huge F1 fan and have been since the early 80s. It is very rare that I find any film that I can find little fault with, but this is one such movie.Historical nuts may take umbridge that the film is not 100% geek-accurate and correct (most films seldom are) but I was very happy with what Ron Howard has done here (I am one such geek!). The casting is so spot on that you genuinely believe that it is Niki Lauda and James Hunt. Chris Hemsworth was never going to quite get Hunt's public school boy accent absolutely bang on but he's done a cracking job nevertheless, and Daniel Bruhl is quite simply spectacular as the matter of fact, calculating Lauda.The race scenes are particularly realistic and it's great to see that genuine period F1 cars were used in the filming rather than the generic "racing cars" one normally sees. The film brings home the danger that these drivers put themselves in during the 70s; Lauda's crash is particularly graphic, being seen from both an outside vantage point and the driver's point of view. There are enough grisly bits to make you wince but you do realise the driving force behind why they did it.The support cast is also fantastic; Lord Hesketh is EXACTLY like real life, and the likeness of the actor playing Clay Regazzoni is uncanny. Olivia Wilde, playing Hunt's wife Suzy, is smouldering and has an excellent English accent.Ron Howard has always been about telling an accurate true-life story which keeps you glued to your seat, and here he tells a story of two World Champions the way it should be done. Even if you don't like Formula 1, this is a MUST SEE film. It will be worth it - it is the best film I have seen in 10 years.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A broad-stroked, but thrilling tale of sporting rivalry.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ron Howard delivers another broad slice of muscular, high-tension biographical melodrama (see previous CV entries: Apollo 13, and Frost/Nixon, both of which are touchstones for some of the thematic elements here), with the retelling of the professional rivalry between 1970s Formula One racing legends, Niki Lauda and James Hunt.Chris Hemsworth tackles the more showy, but actually rather tricky task of essaying Hunt: A cocky, risk-taking, rock-star playboy, who could have been frankly repugnant in less skilled hands, but is handsomely (in every sense of the word) fleshed out by the God of Thunder. Meanwhile Daniel Brühl quietly stamps his authority over the drama with a disciplined take on Lauda's acerbic, neurotic Austrian. The script trowels on the stereotypes a tad thick at times, but both leads deliver, pulling off the not inconsiderable feat of making the audience root for both sides in during their battles.Meanwhile Howard, and his DOP, the brilliant Anthony Dod Mantle, find all manner of extraordinary places to stick their cameras, wedging us into the cockpit in ways that give each race a distinct personality, as well as a tremendous vitality and urgency, and then matching this with a glorious, cacophonous sound design that places one deep inside the action.It ain't subtle. True or not, Hunt's team of amateur Hooray-Henrys appear to have been culled from the Four Weddings understudies list, and the leads' almost comically contrary character traits are perhaps spelled out rather too frequently. But nonetheless, this tale grips like a Brabham, convincingly delivering the thrills and excitement of an era when Formula One was a perilous and free-spirited enterprise.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rush? Rush to the cinema...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In over 60 years of official competition, there have only ever been a handful of movies about what is one of the worlds most popular sports. It's not through lack of inherent drama ? just the last few seasons of F1 alone we've seen a no hoper team come from being scrapped to winning the world title, a championship won on the last corner of the final race of the season and racers walk away from what should have been life ending crashes. But whether it be the subject matter often being almost too extraordinary or the fear that recreating the sport on screen could almost be as expensive as running a team for a year, in general cinema has steered clear of the sport. So with RUSH arriving in cinemas, from Imagine Entertainment, Working Title Films and in the hands of director Ron Howard, have they achieved what few had dared challenge previous and created a heart pounding thrill ride of a movie or was the task too much for what is a modestly budgeted British film from a company best known for making Hugh Grant rom coms?RUSH tells the extraordinary story of the 1976 Formula 1 world championship, and the merciless 1970s rivalry between the cool, calm playboy Brit James Hunt and methodical, driven Austrian Niki Lauda. Starring Chris 'Thor' Hemsworth and Daniel Bruhl, director and former Happy Days star Ron Howard has crated a film of such brilliance that, much like documentary Senna, it transcends interest of the sport it focus on and presents what is one of the best performed and most gripping stories of the year so far. It helps that this truly was a fascinating year ? from Lauda's near fatal crash, to behind the scenes political manoeuvrings and some of the most fierce on track racing ever witnessed in the sport, a year if someone wrote it down without the facts to back it up you'd probably never believe it.But is this anything more than a love letter to the glory days of a sport now controlled by corporations and banks? Yes, in fact whilst the racing is expertly handled and form some of the films most intense moments, it's the story of two men's bitter rivalry (and friendship) that sit firmly at the heart of this story. Hemsworth, who no doubt will set hearts a fluttering all bare chest and flowing haired, proves he more than a man with a large hammer and tights matching his charismatic subject matter James Hunt smile for smile. At the same time not to be outdone Bruhl, whose credits mostly include European films few have seen other than a turn in QT's Inglorious Basterds delivers a performance layered and emotionally grabbing that you just know he will rightfully end up with a trophy cabinet of awards come silly season next year. The positives don't stop there: From the lovingly recreated period detail (and not just the numerous F1 cars dragged out if retirement and museums to once again roar for the crowds), to the sense of danger at every turn, Howard and his team recreate the era almost perfectly and when the cars do race, the film pulls no punches. Actual arial photography taken at the time, mixed seamlessly with some of the most innovative racing cinematography ever placed on screen, every gear change, every button push is a thing of beauty. RUSH's cinematography (by Anthony Dod Mantle) is genuinely a thing of beauty and does well to hide what is, by all accounts, a low budget by Hollywood terms. But don't forget this Isn't a Hollywood movie. It may be directed by Ron Howard but this is a Working Title film. A British film. Okay so at $40million USD it's the biggest film working title have put together, but this is more British that Potter or Bond could ever hope to be. In short RUSH is a directorial triumph and probably Howard's best movie for some years. Also special note should go to Peter Morgan, writer of The Queen and Frost/Nixon, for a excellent screenplay that allows the story to take shape through the characters whilst allowing the actors enough space to add their own flair to the film. Is the film perfect? No. It takes liberties with actual events, being more a story inspired by the truth rather than representing the truth and at times it's both predictable and obviously when it strays from what is obviously the facts. But these things rarely matter against the backdrop of a film that tells the story of one of sports best rivalries, presenting in what is probably the best film of the year so far.Like Senna, RUSH tells a story that transcends the sport that works as the backdrop, a story of dedication, desire, competition, death defying acts and men willing to give everything for the glory of success. In doing so it opens itself to a wider audience that it could have hoped and, when awards season comes, should hopefully see itself recognised accordingly.For more Check out www.thefilmpodcast.co.uk</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If you love F1, this is the best thing since Hamilton's last gasp championship</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay, hands up, I am a long time F1 fan, and for me this was always going to be the film of the summer the moment I knew it was coming out. Personally it exceeded my expectations in every way, and the whole film is superbly made.Unless you have been living under a rock, you will know the outcome/major plot points going into the cinema, and even so, the film does a wonderful job conveying the drama and tension of F1 of that era. Ron Howard has crafted a great story of epic rivalry which transcends the sport in ways that few films have ever done before. For me it evoked the best racing moments, and it is one of the few times I will go and watch a film twice at the cinema.The two main actors are very good in their roles, and Chris Hemsworth steals the show as James Hunt. He owns the part, and it was a real pleasure seeing him bring Hunt to the big screen. The rest of the cast were also great, and the understated role Lauda's wife played in the film added layers that added to the drama.In the end this is a film that I will take great delight in rewatching, and I recommend it whole heartedly.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After watching the trailers, and being an F1 fan for over 20 years - I had set my expectations for this film very high. The acting is superb, Daniel Bruhl's performance as Lauda is incredible, and both actors do a stunning job. The script is solid and I think really encapsulates the era of Formula 1 when more often that not drivers either died or got seriously injured as a consequence of participating in the F1 world championship.The film is also beautifully shot, and really takes the audience back to that era in a visual sense.The best racing movie ever made is an understatement, this was an excellent job all round by everyone involved and did justice to one of Sport's most intense rivalries.Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Before you read this review, let me just say that I am a 15 year old teenage girl with little/no knowledge of Formula 1 and its history. However, I thought this film was brilliant. Perfect casting with Chris Hemsworth playing British playboy James Hunt and Daniel Bruhl playing 'rat faced'Austrian Niki Lauda. The relationship between both drivers is one of the main focus points of the movie, and was the main reason i love this film, because even though they both race against each for the F1 title and frequently call each other a***h****, the clearly have a profound amount of respect for each other and you could go as far as saying they were friends.The actual racing shots were at times beautiful and had my adrenaline pumping and on the edge of my seat in the cinema. another thing i loved about this film was the way that, as well as being about races, the film was paced like a race, a fact I didn't realize until i came out of the cinema and thought about it. Hunt and Lauda both in the lead at different points. Lauda when he beats Hunt in the first half of the F1 season, Hunt when Lauda crashes and melts half of his face off, a scene which had me wincing in my seat, as well as a particular scene wear Lauda tries to get his helmet back on having only half healed, his ear still incomplete. the last point I will make is the fact that you don't have to be a F1 fan or have any previous knowledge of Hunt or Lauda's historic feuding to be amazed by this film, as well as learning a tremendous amount! This film is a must see for 2013!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I loved it, I dragged my husband to the theater, he thought I was just interested to watch a movie with the Thor actor. How surprise he was, that I actually choose the best movie this time. It's an excellent film, great cinematography, great acting, it's Chris Hemsworth best performance, and the actor that plays Nikki Lauda, Daniel Bruhl, what great actor, he was in the movie inglorious bastards, couldn't really tell at the moment cause he looks so different. The movie takes you back to the 70's, and it really keeps you in the edge of your sit. Don't miss it,is one of those movies that you really enjoy a lot more in theaters. I could really say it's the best movie of the year so far.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Saw It Twice Already, Would See Again.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was lucky enough to attend two pre-screenings of this movie (spoiled, right?). Let me start by saying that I have limited F1 knowledge, and the guests I brought to the first pre-screening had zero racing knowledge. That being said, we honestly didn't expect to really enjoy the movie - to us, it was just a free movie. Let me tell you though, we all came out of the theater and just said, "wow".The movie has racing scenes, yes, but the movie is not a racing movie. Racing fans will appreciate the mild technicality of the F1 scenes, but EVERYONE will love the meaningful message and themes that Ron Howard successfully portrays through these two characters.I wasn't fully familiar with the Hunt-Lauda rivalry prior to the movie, but even if I was, I really think this movie is a fresh new look at these two important F1 figures and their interaction with each other. The casting was just spot on and you can just see a glimpse of that if you ever watch live interviews of the characters after seeing the movie (which I did, admittedly).So, I saw it again. I got to really focus on the background scenes and the beautiful cinematography the second time around. It's really just a well crafted movie, and you need to go see it. Don't let the F1-ness of the movie turn you off. I almost let it, but I'm glad I went. Bravo to Howard, Hemsworth, Bruhl and the rest of the cast!</fullReview>

Wow, Amazing, Awesome...are some of the expressions by people coming out of the theater. I didn't go in with too much expectations but I surely came out inspired! The acting, cinematography, background score, editing, direction...all spotless and keeps you glued to your seats to the end. The whole late 1970s treatment to the film is very convincing. Two completely different individuals with a common goal in life...to be the best. Ron Howard has done full justice in telling this story in the best possible manner. Hemsworth and Bruhl...will remember their performances for a long long time. Watch it if you love the whole "Cinema" experience!10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gather ye forth to hear the epic tale of Hunt and Lauda, as told by Howard of Oklahoma!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sport and the rivalry between champions has been an integral part of Western drama and culture since it's inception in ancient Greece, replete with archetypes of struggle, hubris, victory and loss, triumph and tragedy. With the advent of organised mass participation sports in the 20th century, the sports tales enjoyed a revival in popular culture, but their basic structure and purpose remained intact. "Rush" is just such a tale, taken from real life and made into an epic poem for the masses.The sport in question is Formula 1 (The world racing league popular especially in Europe, Asia and South America but largely unknown in the USA) which has all the required thrills of speed, skill and danger as well as brilliant mavericks at the wheel, the modern day epic charioteers. The story it tells is that of the infamous 1976 season - a period when danger and death still stalked the sport in a way that has been largely erased today -and the rivalry between two legendary drivers, the Briton James Hunt and the Austrian Niki Lauda. The two came from similar backgrounds (wealthy business families) which they shunned to pursue the chequered flag. However their personalities were polar opposites, Hunt was the typical Errol Flynn style devil may care cad gay-blade and libertine, living for the girls, the booze,the adventure and the Devil take tomorrow. Lauda on the other hand was the cold, clinical rationalist technocrat who calculated everything in terms of percentages, including risk, and who treated fun and happiness as enemies of a stable existence. The media naturally played up the rivalry and turned the season into a battle between the two. Their rivalry was indeed very personal, and the two never lost an opportunity to mock or belittle the other, yet like all epic enemies they not only respected each other but needed each other, one not whole without the other, day and night, ying and yang. Like all epic tales, theirs came complete with shades of both victory and tragedy. Lauda crashed and was terribly scarred by fire during the Nurburgring race, nearly dying, yet he fought back and even returned to racing mere weeks later, still contesting the title, and despite losing to Hunt, went on to win many more championships and became a successful business mogul and technological innovator to boot. Hunt fought back against seemingly endless hurdles and setbacks to claw impossible victory with sheer guts and pluck to take the world championship, yet his wild ways destroyed his marriage and happiness then eventually his whole life, ending up dead aged just 45.The film is a British-European one, telling a European legend, yet it has the most American of directors, Ron Howard. Surprisingly, the film is largely devoid of Howard's trademark sugariness and mawkish sentimentality save for the final coda, and even that feels strangely appropriate given the story he has told.Instead it showcases Howard's technical flare and experienced hand, telling the convergent and then concomitant stories of Hunt and Lauda, including their courtships and marriages, in just two hours in a time when even action movies with nothing to say scrape the three hour mark as a norm. His visual skill is also notable, not only in the all important Formula 1 scenes, which wisely follow Frankenheimer's example in "Grand Prix", but also in giving the film a good sense of period feel. For a cheap film, it looks great. The script by Peter Morgan also follows classical form and avoids making it a simplistic battle between a "good guy" and a "bad guy" (as many sports biographies do to their shame and detriment), instead giving us two great heroes, flaws and all.The score comes courtesy of the legendary Hans Zimmer, and is strictly in the "Gladiator" mould (aptly enough) with epic themes laced with anthems of struggle and victory, and laments of tragedy and loss. Complementing it is a selection of fantastic songs from the period from the likes of Thin Lizzy, David Bowie, Mud, Slade, Stevie Winwood, Clara Nunes &amp; Rosanna Fratello.Of course everything hangs on the actors playing the mythic heroes, and here is the film's greatest strength, two well known skillful actors who also look remarkably similar to their real life counterparts. Chris Hemsworth, playing the dashing heroic Hunt with an upper class English brogue naturally evokes "Thor", yet the evocation is suitable, as both are mythic figures who start out as cads and grow into wisdom. He finds both the dash and the inner pain of the character and makes us care for him despite his many faults. Similarly, Daniel Bruhl, best known as the sniper in "Inglorious Bastards", gives us a Lauda who is cold, unlikeable, rude, very arrogant and superior, and a poor loser, yet also finds the buried spark of life in the man, a passion that is expressed in the language of mechanics but comes from a strong heart, especially in the powerful bond he has with his wife Marlene. She is played excellently by Alexandra Maria Lara, while Hunt's rather temporary wife, supermodel Suzy Miller, is played by an unrecognisable Olivia Wilde, emoting pathos for the love she hoped for but never found. The rest of the cast is well filled with excellent veteran character actors, including Pierfrancesco Favino as Ferrari teammate Clay Regazzoni and Christian McKay as Hunt's humorous aristocratic backer Lord Hesketh.A powerful and engrossing human story, epic poem and true life chronicle, it is enjoying great popularity in Europe and elsewhere but will inevitably face problems in F1-phobic America. Let us hope it can cross this cultural barrier, as many, many US sports movies have coming in the opposite direction, and be enjoyed for the universal tale it is, well told, thrilling and uplifting.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To me this was a very consistent film, it stayed exciting and gripping throughout. The races did not drag on, something I thought could ruin the film but it was better than I thought. The one thing I loved more than anything is that there was no mistakes. The directing from Ron Howard was flawless, the score by Hans Zimmer was without surprise breath-taking and among his best work in my eyes. The film ends when you want it to, not too early or too late. I was not alive when the actual events took place but I have been told that the plot follows the events accurately. This film was pretty much perfection to me, there's nothing I can criticize about the film and I would be very surprised if this doesn't pick up a few awards.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>good memories of a great time!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am old enough to remember the real duel between Lauda and Hunt, and am delighted that someone has finally spotted what a great story it was. I loved the film because it took me back to being an impressionable sixteen-year-old who, in common with most of my friends had fallen completely for James Hunt's charm and offbeat good looks. We hadn't been Formula 1 fans - or fans of blokes with posh accents, being northerners - but we definitely were now! I remember following the whole season on the radio, deciphering Murray Walker's near-hysterical commentary to find out what was going on. Needless to say, I loved the film and I thought the two main characters were unbelievably good, especially Chris Hemsworth, who pulled off the depiction of something close to a national icon incredibly well, getting Hunt's public-school drawl and round-shouldered walk perfectly, as well as his dangerous mixture of immaturity and charisma. I also thought that Daniel Bruhl made an unlikeable character, - frowning, earnest, pedantic and generally irritating - much more accessible than he could have been.The atmosphere of the 1970s was captured perfectly - leather miniskirts, dubious haircuts, rampant sexism, and incredible freedom and glamour for those who could afford it. I also liked the way the grime and scruffiness of Formula 1 came across, as well as its hazardous and uncertain nature: it's hard to believe that nowadays the Nurburgring simply isn't used any more because it's too dangerous. My only caveat was that some of the other characters in the sport, like Enzo Ferrari, and some of the other drivers like Fittipaldi and Scheckter could have been used to greater effect, but maybe that would have detracted from the leads, who were just electrifying. I hope Ron Howard can collect some kind of award for this film because he certainly deserves it. As to the warts-and-all depiction of Hunt, I hope the film stirs memories of a great sportsman, so British he was almost a cliché, but who in addition to being insanely brave also had humour and intelligence way beyond the capacity of many of the much lesser characters in the media nowadays. His family should be really proud.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Two different points of view about facing death</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I knew I would like this film because I was an avid fan of Formula 1. After all I spun on a Lotus Formula 3 at Druids hairpin, Brand Hatch where I was at a racing school. The film shows all the cars going through Druids. The surprise was my wife, who I thought would get bored and was enthusiastic about the film. The scene I most enjoyed was probably inspired by "The Social Network" when a girl realizes she just slept with Sean Parker, and in this case it happens when some fans meet Niki Lauda. By concentrating on the relationship between two drivers and with a great screenplay by Peter Morgan, Ron Howard gives the best film ever about motor racing . Not a year would pass without some deaths among the drivers, and the different points of view about it from Hunt and Lauda are fascinating stuff. There is not one boring moment here, also the women, Olivia Wilde (Suzy Hunt) and Alexandra Maria Lara (Marlene Lauda) are perfect for their roles. Chris Hemsworth is excellent as James Hunt, but the real star is Daniel Brühl as Niki Lauda. I give 10 over 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are so many times you walk out of the cinema after being emotionally drained with excitement prior to a film to be ultimately let down by the final product. I found this even more so with true stories where the short time the director has to portray a significant amount of information and events, usually fails to do so; this was not the case with Rush. Ron Howard, i have to take my hat off to you, you have annoyed me on the grid walks at the F1 races for the last 6 months with his over the top American nature but his excitement must have been fuelled by his masterpiece that he has created.I Highly suggest, either prior to watching it or post film, you watch the documentary on them with the real life footage and you will see how to each minor detail of Niki Lauda's (Daniel Brühl) facial expressions, his rat like teeth, his confident yet calculated persona and James Hunts (Chris Hemsworth) arrogant, lavish, reckless aura. I would have given it a 9/10 as 10/10 is just virtually impossible in my book but seeing the documentary after, you just see how much research and detail has been put into this and how they have turned one of racing most incredible rivalries and tragedies into a living masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the best movie of 2013 so far and I doubt an upcoming movie will take this spot (maybe Gravity).The balance is poetic in every form: the balance between the two protagonists, but even more so the balance in sequences of the two. You never get bored watching and just when you're about to get bored, it switches brilliantly. The story is, for me, one of the strongest points and one of the best sports film stories ever.But that's just the plot and the balance and pacing; the achievement in cinematography is just stunning. Engines being fired, ultra zoomed cameras attached to the car's gear where you see every little thing moving, rain falling in slow-motion... everything is so, so beautiful.But that's just graphically: the sound is so deep, so real, it reels you in and echoes afterwards. In combination with the music, just brilliant.But that's just the cinematography: the actors deliver an astonishing performance; you hate them both, but you wish them both the best, they should both win. Hemsworth is truly arrogant and believable, Brühl is truly driven and professional. The chemistry, although I hate that word, is just spot on.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stylish but lacks a real emotional connection?other than racing scenes, movie lacks urgency</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ron Howard is the rare Hollywood auteur that doesn't have a distinctive style (how did the guy that gave us "Frost /Nixon" give us Jim Carrey's "How the Grinch Stole Christmas"?!). In his latest film "Rush", we get a glimpse of Howard playing with some Danny Boyle-esque flair, especially in the racing scenes. Unfortunately, outside of this visceral, kinetic spirit, "Rush" lacks an emotional connection with its audience, leaving us in the dust with only a memory of what just sped past. The amazing true story about the on-and-off-the-track rivalry of racers James Hunt (Hemsworth) and Niki Lauda (Bruhl) should be ripe pickings for good filmmaking. The story has some unexpected turns that are enlivened by their being true. Add to that some decent performances and a strong middle section involving a hospital, this should be a no-brainer success. Sadly the film fails in a number of other ways: the dialogue, while not bad, is unoriginal and boring, clichéd and overly-Hollywood. This along with some silly, overwrought Hollywood moments ("We may hate each other, but at least we respect each other") hurt "Rush" immensely. Admittedly, I am not a racing fan of any kind, and this is clearly a movie made for them. Nonetheless, I think Howard is trying to reach beyond this demographic but comes up short. "Rush" is by no means a complete failure, but when it steps away from the formula 1 racing and slows down, it really putters out?pun totally intended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Rush' is the true story of the legendary rivalry between Formula-1 drivers James Hunt and Niki Lauda. This film takes place over the course of about five years, highlighting the most important time in these men's lives.1. Ron Howard truly is a master of his craft (and has raced his way to the top of my 'favorite film directors' list) as he succeeds massively with this biopic of the decade. He captures the sheer intensity of what and how dangerous the world of Formula-1 racing can be by putting the audience in the driver's seat. 'Rush' is a prime example that proves just how utterly ridiculous the 'Fast &amp; Furious' films are by grounding itself in the harsh reality and challenges faceb by both Lauda and Hunt.2. Apart from the incredible cinematography and spectacular racing sequences, the real force behind this film are the performances. Hemsworth and Bruhl lead the pack with the latter being the more outstanding. Daniel Bruhl is spectacular with his spot-on portrayal as Niki Lauda, from the accent to his mannerisms, Bruhl deserved an Oscar nomination for this particular performance. Hemsworth on the other hand does prove that he has acting chops when it comes to dramatic roles in his portrayal as James Hunt. The reason why Bruhl stands out more is due to how different Hunt and Lauda are, with him just being more of a driven character with his highly focused attitude.3. Olivia Wilde and Alexandra Maria Lara round out the cast as Hunt and Lauda's respective wives. They play important parts in the lives of these men within the years of them chasing the Formula-1 'World Title'. Their stories can seem crow-barred in but it's hard not to touch on some of the lighter events in the lives of these men. The transitions between the love stories is my only nit-pick of this film (only by reflection), but it's hard to find many flaws when the movie speeds past such things with perfect editing.Next to 'A Beautiful Mind', 'Rush' is (without a doubt) Ron Howard's best film to date, and in years to come, could very well be considered a classic. Powerful, moving and outstanding, 'Rush' delivers an incredible cinematic experience, no matter if you see it on the big or small screen."The closer you are to death, the more alive you feel;)"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Was really surprised by how good this was</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Despite not being an auto racing fan, the stories of the rivalry between James Hunt and Niki Lauda and Lauda's accident are well known and on research was big news in the 70s. 'Rush' did seem intriguing, Ron Howard has done some good work in the past and my sister and her boyfriend absolutely raving about it. However having no knowledge of auto racing and having never found it my cup of tea there was a touch of intrepidation. As well as the worry as to whether there was going to be any bias and whether it was going to stray from the facts. After watching 'Rush', this viewer is so glad that she gave it a chance because it was a gripping and entertaining film from start to finish, and quite easily Howard's best work in some time.Some occasional rushed pacing and some weak dialogue, that lacked flow, sounded awkward and stuck out like a sore thumb against everything else that was done to such a professional level, were the only drawbacks to overall one of 2013's better films. The time period is very evocatively depicted, there is a real sense of time and place, there is wonderful vibrant colour throughout, the editing is slick, clever and gives the race scenes the thrills they need and the photography is similarly audaciously slick and like the cinematographer was part of the action itself, especially good in the climactic Japanese race sequence. Hans Zimmer's score is not his best work by all means, but it went with the racing theme remarkably well and does capture the mid-70s time period and the atmosphere of the sport to such great effect (again the final race in Japan stood out). The sound effects also help, having a real authenticity.For a film about auto racing, one does have to talk about how 'Rush' deals with the race sequences. The good news is that they are absolutely thrilling and keeps one to the edge of their seat, while all of them are brilliantly done, showing how glamorous and also dangerous the sport is (not many sports films I've seen have properly and fully captured the spirit of the sport it's portraying in the way Rush did) the highlight is the climactic Japanese race, which was both exhilarating and moving (masterful if having to sum it up in one word). Howard not only depicts the mid- 70s as if the viewer were transported back in time and part of the period (such was the evocativeness of the atmosphere) and adopts a visual style that never looks cheap and as said like the cinematographer was there part of the action, but he shows here that he knows how to tell a story. The storytelling is always compelling, thoughtful, informative and thrilling with a surprising amount of emotional impact, found myself really identifying with Lauda.The film is faithful to the facts, the rivalry between Hunt and Lauda is genuinely engaging and are shown a lot of respect and dimension here. Neirher Hunt or Lauda are one-dimensional here and, although Lauda is the more sympathetically drawn of the two, one does not takes sides with one or the other. It also is tightly paced and assured, never getting bogged down in too much back story, too much soap- opera, too much sentimentality or technical jargon/minutiae (that would likely have gone over the heads of first-time viewers or non-fans of the sport). All the supporting performances are well-done, though some with not much to do, with Olivia Wilde and Christian McKay faring the strongest. It is however the two leads that carry 'Rush' cast wise, both of them as close to perfect as one can get. Daniel Brühl gives Niki Lauda a real brooding intensity and genuine poignancy, making it very easy to feel sorry for him, while swaggering Chris Hemsworth has never been better as Hunt.All in all, a gripping and hugely entertaining film. Has its imperfections but they are far outweighed by the number of things 'Rush' does right. 9/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just watched this movie today, only knowing a little about the plot. I know very little about Formula 1 racing, as I've not a very big sports guy, but damn, was I impressed with this. I rooted for both Hunt and Louda, portrayed brilliantly by Chris Hemsworth and Daniel Bruhl, which is quite unusual for me as I normally would be quick to take sides in movies such as these that surround rivalry and competition. This only shows how incredibly Rush handled it's characters and their motives. The cinematography used by Ron Howard throughout this movie was top notch, I felt immersed in every scene. There were many emotional aspects of this movie that I also liked, which connected me to the characters a lot more. Ultimately, I couldn't find a thing wrong with Rush when I tried, it is simply perfect for what it was going for, telling an interesting and down to earth story based on true events.</fullReview>

In a modern era of boring, faceless sports stars it's hard to believe that in the mid 1970's, most sports had at least one maverick personality. Amongst others, Football had George Best, Snooker had Alex Higgins, Motor cycling had Barry Sheen and John McEnroe was emerging in tennis. Along with Hunt they were The Peoples' Champions of their day, not just for their talent but the thrill of watching an individual whose brilliance was as likely to surface as his ability to self destruct has always been irresistible to the public. Any volatile talent requires a nemesis. In the case of James Hunt it was Niki Lauda. Rational, calculating and the epitome of professionalism, Lauda was an earlier prototype for the modern day athlete. His commitment and focus was a far cry from the flamboyant personality of his rival.The two main actors are superb in the roles. Not only do the actors look like the drivers they are representing, the portrayals are believably acted. The season was so dramatic and controversial that the script needed little deviation from the truth. In fact the only small criticism of the film is the odd scene thrown in for dramatic impact that actually didn't historically occur. It's hard to believe that the director Ron Howard was acting in a cheesy American 50's nostalgia show when these two driving legends were sparring for the World Drivers Title back in 1976. This was a time before Formula One became F1. Happy Days!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I'm Puzzled Why The Oscars Ignored This</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember seeing the trailers for RUSH when it was just about to hit the cinemas in the early Autumn of 2013 and thinking it was going to be a major contender for the Oscars . This is the type of movie the Academy Awards love in theory . True life story with actors playing true life people and at the heart of the story rivalry where men risk their lives to show they're better than their rival . On top of that from what you're able to glean from the trailers this is a very proficient film from a technical point of view and I had this down as walking off with the Oscar for editing and sound . Therefore I was totally shocked that the film did not receive a single nomination when the nominations were revealed at the start of 2014 . True 2013 was an exceptional year for films but after finally getting round to watching RUSH I'm still at a loss why it didn't pick up more awards and nominations Now I've got to put my cards on the table and say motor sport doesn't interest me in the slightest . Formula one is the personification of "spectator sport" and totally uninvolving . If you or I were to drive a car a couple of hundred miles per hour down a stretch of road we'd be looking at a court case . As I said I've no interest in this so called sport but as a child I do vaguely remember the rivalry between James Hunt and Niki Lauda . Of course all the British press were on the side of Hunt due to chauvinism , To be blunt Hunt was the type of man you're going to instinctively hate on every level . A privileged background , an out and out playboy , too handsome by half and uses every opportunity as an absolute sex magnet it's difficult to find any type of likability in him . Add to this he was a success and bingo , you've got a ready made villain . RUSH doesn't waste much time in showing whose side we should take . Lauda isn't exactly short of money himself but with his arrival on the racing circuit we see a very introverted unassuming man who wants to win . Again this single minded will to succeed in sport can be potentially alienating . Speaking as a Brit our sports heroes are flawed , self destructive people and we don't like dominant winners but this film despite the bias doesn't paint either man as black or white and we see two very complex men at the zenith of their careers trying to be champion . It also points out how dangerous F1 racing was back in those days . In the last 20 years three formula one drivers died in races and I had to check to see if "Two drivers being killed every season" wasn't in fact hyperbole and it was indeed a tragic statistic in the mid 1970sThe acting is uniformly superb and never for a moment did I think was watching actors playing roles . Aussie actor Chris Hemsworth is James Hunt and Daniel Bruhl is Niki Lauda . . The races themselves are fast and exciting but the film really concentrates on the drama between two men and has a great sense of time and place . Again I've got to repeat that I was puzzled why it wasn't Oscar nominated in any category and seeing it at last I am now doubly puzzled . It's one of the rare occasions where the IMDb members have found a film underrated and put it in the top 250 movies where as the more prestigious award ceremonies had snubbed it</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really like movies like this where I actually feel like I'm learning something. In fact, it interests me enough that I can't wait to look up more information once the movie is finished. I didn't know anything about Niki Lauda or James Hunt or any of the film's events. So everything was fresh and exciting for me. It's quite a cool story. Such a close year between two racers who are so different with so many ups and downs.It's incredible how perfectly cast this movie is, especially the two leads. They look just like the real people, it's uncanny. It's so great when film-makers can show this level of respect and appreciation for the real people and world their film is based on. Rather than turning to standard Hollywood climaxes and one-liners, they invest time and soul into the story and all of the real details. I believe Lauda was involved with the production and confirmed the end result is very accurate.There are some great quotes in this movie. All of the dialogue between James and Niki is sharp and surprisingly thoughtful. It's often venomous but even more so, it's truthful and playful. Best mates seem to be expected to insult each-other pretty heavily as a weird kind of way of showing how close they are. Niki and James seem to settle into this kind of a relationship. They get on each-others nerves because they can. At first, they hate each-other but gradually they realise the competition between them can actually be a good thing, something they might even need or desire.They are opposites and parallels at the same time. They share feelings and experiences that very few others do, risking their lives time and again, being the best at what they do, surrounded by people that don't fully understand. Enemies and personal friends. They have to talk big, that's part of the sport. And they legitimately get angry with each- other several times. But when things are serious, they look out for each-other. In one scene, a journalist asks Niki a rude, personal question and James decides to privately teach him a little lesson. They protect each-other but might not openly admit it.Their lifestyles are extremely different. James is a playboy, living everyday literally as if it were his last. He believes part of his appeal to women is his closeness to death - that it makes him all the more alive. Niki is much more up-tight. He is efficient and logical. He falls out with his father who won't support his passion for racing. His confidence and focus help him rapidly establish himself independently. It's really interesting when he explains why he doesn't drive fast off-the-track. He's always thinking, aware of all the options he has and picking the best one. He's also very lonely and kind (although he can be harsh and direct). I felt I could relate to him a lot.I thought the acting was really good all-around. The editing and style of the film were unique and suitable for the story. The way the story built up was very exciting and fascinating especially since you know it's based on a true story. You care even more about the characters than you normally would. There are plenty of funny and sad moments but the movie is never preachy. The pace was appropriately high for a movie called Rush - you never have a chance to get bored. Meanwhile the film itself comes across as anything but rushed. I think it has one of the most entertaining and memorable rivalries in film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the best sport movies I have ever seen, the editing is a masterpiece and the acting is just perfect. Nothing to add. Amazing. The story of Lauda is terrific. I have been waiting for this movie for such a long time. It would have been easy to fall into cheesy campy film making with this plot.... But somehow it felt, as a viewer, that you were actually a fly on the wall watching a friendship form in an authentic, organic fashion. The timing of their meeting felt pre-ordained, like something bigger or higher was putting them together at the right time. I loved the religious undertones. Real without shoving it in your face. But faith portrayed as something that provides hope and encouragement, is real and worth having.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>MY REVIEW: Rush for This!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rush. Based on real story of rivalry between two F1 drivers of 70s, dashing James Hunt played by 'Thor' fame Chris Hemsworth and clinical Niki Lauda played by incredible Daniel Brühl.Like a F1 race, Rush is also a racy drive with lots of bends in the story testing the lead characters' spirit and temperament. Both lead characters are so well developed and well played that they leave an indelible mark on your minds. Director Ron Howard masterly organizes a wonderful show of technical finesse, sharp dialogues, uncluttered screenplay and cinematic thrill of F1 racing. The love-hate-respect relationship between James and Niki is electric and every now and then you feel the adrenaline rush that they are feeling. There is hardly any dull moment and emotional conflicts revolving around the love lives of both the racers is handled with a light hand so that you are never distracted from the main plot. I am going with fantastic 8 out of 10 for Rush. This is one of the best sports movies in recent times and will surely get a cult status in future. Rush for this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Must-See!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ron Howard has returned to the big screen with his latest film, Rush. Rush is an excellent film, one of his best. He surrounds himself with an excellent screenwriter and an excellent cast to come up with a product that is larger than life. I totally despise auto racing, so I thought the film would be a major turnoff. The only reason I saw the film is Ron Howard and the phenomenal reviews. The film goes deeper than just the racing aspect of the sport, as it focuses on rivalry of the two biggest stars. The characterization is layered and for that reason alone is what gives this movie a heads up over the formulaic sports movies.Howard's latest film tells the story of the most intense rivalry of any European sports figures in the 1970's: Formula Racing Stars James Hunt and Niki Lauda. Each man have polarizing personalities which fit into their rivalry. Hunt is a self-centered social party-goer who relies upon his relations with everyone and Lauda is a serious, hidden man who achieves his victory in a more intellectual manner.The acting is very, very good. Chris Hemsworth sheds his Thor persona and delivers his best performance to date. That being said, there is someone who does even better and that is Daniel Bruhl. First recognized in 2009's Inglorious Basterds, this role may have achieved Bruhl stardom. Olivia Wilde is a good actress, but if there is any complaints at all, she is underused and only seems to act as eye candy.Overall, Rush is an excellent movie as it rushes past formula to deliver something entertaining and original. It is hard to put out an original sports film these days, and Rush does just that. The film brought the intense rivalry to my eyes and I am keen on learning more. The film has excellent direction, acting, and writing but I also must praise the technical side of the movie. The visuals and sound effects are strong and Hans Zimmer creates another magnificent score. This is Howard's best film in years. I rate this film 9.5/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A true rush</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's difficult to think of something more tedious than car races. If you could only appreciate this movie if you liked F1, than this would have a very small audience. Thankfully, that's not the case. This adrenaline fuelled drama is a high octane power house with great acting, writing and directing which manages to make a boring sport interesting. It tells the real life story of the rivalry between car racers James Hunt and Niki Lauda. Both are different characters and neither are especially likable, but they're both well rounded and excellent played. Chris Hemsworth, a promising actor who really is choosing his films well, is very good as Hunt, but Daniel Bruhl is even better as Lauda, and his performance might be the best individual element of the film. Rush is another drama film, and there are many points which feel somewhat predictable and generic, so it has detours, but otherwise it's first gear straight to the Oscars.... who decided to completely ignore it. Typical.The only other Ron Howard film I've seen is half of Backdraft, so I was sceptical but his direction and editing are astonishing. The race sequences are exhilarating and make you feel like you're in the car with the drivers. Most of the dialogue feels genuine and it keeps you compelled throughout. It apparently employs some artistic license with the real events but not enough to make it feel like total nonsense (It's no Braveheart). Rush is a thrilling and moving drama which is a superior sports movie and if Gravity isn't a British movie than quite possibly the best British film of 2013. This is predictable at times which makes it a four star movie but it's a high four stars. Despite the predictability you can't always tell what's going to happen and by the end Rush is surprisingly moving. The character rivalry and development are what make the movie so compelling, not the race sequences. Hemsworth and Bruhl should have received Oscar nominations for their performances.8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An intelligent grab advantages from enemies rather than fool's profitable from friends.This movie made me realized that sometimes enemies knows us more than our friends or even better known than we know ourselves and sometimes the person who does not required us to deceased is them because it would be dispirited if one day our enemies who we have raced for entire life they are departed, therefore having good enemies consequently having friends and this is an essence of this movie "Rush"."Rush" is the movie that included comedy, drama, 70's and especially for anyone who interested in rivalry. This movie is based on the true story between two greatest racers James Hunt (Christ Hemsworth from The Avengers and Thor) and Niki Lauda (Daniel Bruhl). Two of them are first seen in competition in 1970 at a Formula 3 race at Crystal Palace. It was not a very impressing start between them, and increasingly more and more until the two are raised up to Formula 1. They completed throughout in racing and living, pushing them to the breaking point, both physically and mentally."James" is a real British bad boy racer who is always thirsty for victory in racing, and dares to take a bet with his life because he considered this is the charm of this sport. While he was living out off the race enjoy partying and women. Although married, but he still preferred to lived like play boy. His abilities and handsome face make him become star in the field especially for girls.Contrary to "Niki" he is an Austrian driver with talent of tuning cars. Niki focused on planning in advanced and discipline as vital. He is not the person who would like to bet his life on the race and perceive as stupid idiot to do that. Because of his characteristics, so he not a big fan of most people likes James but he doesn't care. Niki preferred to lives in the way of peace with his wife more than going out in society.In love angle is superbly catered by Olivia Wilde (Hunt's first wife Suzy) and the gorgeous Alexandra Maria Lara - the bane of fame ? as the future Marlene Lauda. Both give quality performances.Two of them are very different, so it is not surprising that they are incompatible. But that pressure automatically becomes impetus for two of them especially in 1976 Grand Prix Competition race of round 10th that is the main incidence of the story (and it was the year that Formula 1 fans hailed that most enjoyable) craving to his overcome opponent make James begin to race back on top form again, similarly with Niki who had the accident and has made him to nearly halt his career but while being treated for his facial injuries and almost losing all of his right ear, he is still on the first placed. James is getting closer more and more to the first place. This fact motivates him to return to racing again just only 42 days later in The Grand Prix Competition race of round 13th at Monza, Italy. At that round he end the race with ranked 4th and completed The Grand Prix tournament as the secondary world championship with points behind his main opponent "James Hunt" just only one single point. But the following year, Lauda was successful again by winning The Grand Prix and got his second world championship. This is an impulse that may not push as much as family or friends.This movie "Rush" makes me realized that in competitions, whether in any sports, the important things is not only winning ? losing or to be a champion but it is to have worthy competitor because opponent constituted the main factor for us to improve ourselves continuously. Provided that none competitors, we might gloat stop improving ourselves which may impact negatively us for differentiation such as a former major company in business association that have been insolvent because of improvidence. This movie directed by Ron Howard, producer and director. He has directed numerous movies and becomes famous from a movie "A beautiful mind" (Biography and Drama film) in 2001 and Apollo 13 in 1995, which earned Howard the Academy Award for Best Director. In addition to the drama made out well, distribute actors' role appropriately, also well done in the racing scenes, given thrill emotions and risks behind steering wheel as well. When combined with the script and the performances of the main characters, especially Daniel extremely outstanding as Niki, while Chris exceedingly cool till has emanated the gods Thor images. The attention in details is excellent. Even though the tracks are not by the facts for understandable reason. The cars, helmets, the sponsors and even the sequences alignment of the Formula 1 cars are all authentic. This movie made spectators feels like it's happening in the 70's.Even you are not the big fan of Formula 1 but if you takes time to watch this movie just 123 minutes, it will be imprinted your memory forever. However, if anyone interested in Formula 1, 70's, cars, great movie, or just want to follow Ron Howard's film, then Rush is the best options for you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Review of Rush</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A true story of chalk-and-cheese Formula One drivers ? one hot-headed, the other coolly calculating ? locked together in a life-and-death rivalry may well seem familiar to UK filmmakers. Yet Asif Kapadia's brilliantly dramatic documentary Senna remains largely unseen by mainstream audiences in America, where it was also scandalously overlooked at the Oscars (here, it won two prestigious Baftas).Rush Production year: 2013 Country: Rest of the world Cert (UK): 15 Runtime: 123 mins Directors: Ron Howard Cast: Alexandra Maria Lara, Chris Hemsworth, Daniel Bruhl, Natalie Dormer, Olivia Wilde More on this film To fill that gap, we now have Rush, Ron Howard's multiplex-friendly account of the friction-filled relationship between James Hunt and Niki Lauda, which eerily echoes the tensions teased out between Ayrton Senna and Alain Prost in Kapadia's groundbreaking work. Well oiled, excitingly noisy and machine-tooled for maximum popcorn appeal, Howard's roaring drama depicts men risking life and limb in insanely dangerous circumstances, although the film itself prefers to play it safe in order to court the widest possible crowd.Scripted by Peter Morgan, whose stage play Frost/Nixon formed the basis of Howard's previous real-life 70s grudge match, Rush paints its dueling antagonists with the most baldly oppositional black-and-white brush strokes. While Hunt is a handsome playboy with a champagne lifestyle and shagadelic reputation (his badge bears the legend "Sex: Breakfast of Champions"), Lauda is a "rat-faced" systems analyst who goes to bed early after sweating over the mathematical permutations of success.As the former, Chris Hemsworth appears on occasion to be channeling the spirit of Austin Powers, a Merrie English swinger for whom naughty NHS nurses in stockings provide more than first aid, while saucy stewardesses offer obliging membership to the mile-high club at the drop of a polo-neck sweater. Toning down his performance only marginally from that of his hammer-swinging thunder god turn in Thor, the Australian Hemsworth is ready for action on and off the track, although his posh- school British accent sometimes slides like slick-tyred wheels on a rainy racetrack.But it's Daniel Brühl as the rigidly locked-down Lauda who is arguably the more interesting of the two; while Hunt's boyish enthusiasms are all on the surface, the enigmatic Austrian's driving forces are more elusive, causing us to wonder about his true motives. Like his eternal adversary, he is a son of wealth rebelling against a privileged past, the common bond that joins this odd couple. But whereas Hunt wears his passions on his sleeve (or, more often, his underpants), Lauda's demons are somewhat internalized, leaving Brühl to wrestle with an emotionally distant character, something he manages with aplomb.Juxtaposing the world views of its yin and yang heroes, Morgan's script treads a fine line between intrigue and overstatement. At its best, this makes for much entertainingly abrasive drama as the rivals' love-hate relationship provokes sparky interaction at pre-race meetings (another flag wave to Senna) and social gatherings alike. Yet such clear-cut divisions can also become an obstacle, with credibility stalling somewhat as simplification wrests control of the narrative steering wheel. It doesn't help that Austin Powers' Basil Exposition himself seems occasionally to be in the commentary box, providing the aural equivalent of subtitles for the hard of thinking.But Howard has always been a die-hard populist, whether serving up the sparkling romantic fantasy of Splash or delving into the murky waters of psychosis in A Beautiful Mind. With such notable exceptions as the dismal The Da Vinci Code and the painfully unfunny The Dilemma, his back catalogue bears testament to his ability to blend solid thematic meat with easily digestible fluff. As such, Rush (which cost a modest $50m) may prove to be a hit with American audiences for whom the subject matter is still something of a foreign country.Significantly, Rush also marks a return to Howard's roots, which are firmly grounded in cinematic dreams of cars. Having starred in American Graffiti, with its nostalgic evocations of drive-ins and hot rods, Howard made his directorial feature debut, in 1977, with Grand Theft Auto, a motorized romantic caper publicized with a cartoon pile-up poster proudly brandishing the tag line: "See the greatest cars in the world destroyed!" ? a promise on which Rush makes good. There are comparisons, too, with Apollo 13, another 70s-set true story about men in all too flimsy machines traveling at speeds that are likely to cause them to burn up and worse. Despite the fact that (most) audiences knew how that particular adventure would end, Howard did a brilliant job of keeping the crackling tension alive by concentrating on the relations between the astronauts, his dexterity with both the mechanics of action cinema and the nuances of dialogue paying dramatic dividends. It's a winning combination that is once again to the fore in Rush.Much credit goes to the ace team of cinematic mechanics whom Howard has assembled to fine-tune his vehicle ? from Anthony Dod Mantle's typically deft and probing camera-work, always finding the unexpected perspective, to the collective efforts of the sound department, whose crunchy gear changes and booming engine throbs put the audience right there in the driver's seat. Visually, the film has an access-all-areas pass to every nook and cranny of the cars, but it's the pulsing baseline of that soundtrack that provides the dramatic chassis of the race sequences. Solid supporting performances add to the appeal, with Alexandra Maria Lara and Olivia Wilde making the most of their twin "muse" roles, while Christian McKay reminds us that we have seen too little of him since his breakthrough role in Me and Orson Welles.Bright, brash and unashamedly formulaic, this is thrillingly accessible fare, aiming more for the straight lines of the home stretch than the tricky curves of those treacherous corners, with Howard keeping one eye always on the grandstand.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This may be Ron Howard's best film. It's certainly his most adult. Usually, Howard's work is cunningly commercial. No smoking on the screen because we don't want to set a bad example and somebody in the audience might be offended. Internal demons are overcome. Happy endings follow."Rush" is a lot more textured than that, and Howard's directorial devices are muted but effective. Not a lot of time is given over to off-track romances. A couple meet and spend a few minutes together, then there is a cut to their marriage, sparing the viewer the agony of indecision and uncertainty and sobs. That comes later, but again it's just as quickly over with. And there are surprising grace notes. Before a more than usually dangerous race, there is the brief silhouette of a particularly venomous looking spider crawling in that deliberate spiderly way down a vertical surface. Just a second or two. More would have cheapened the shot. Less would have shrieked "egomania".The tale, of course, is based on a true 1976b story of rivalry between two Formula I racing car drivers -- Chris Hemsworth, an English playboy with long blond hair, and Daniel Brühl, an ambitious Austrian with a face like a garden gnome.Immediately, we like Hemsworth and dislike Brühl. Hemsworth is more handsome and has a more immediately appealing personality. It's a tribute to the director and the writer, Peter Morgan, that over time, as we get to understand both men better, they cross the finish line in a tie.The racing scenes are kept within bounds, sometimes skipped entirely and announced on TV or read about in a newspaper. The balance is just about right. And so is the explicitness of Brühl's injuries and the pain of his recovery. They aren't dwelt on or milked for a cheap gush of sympathy.The two women mainly involved with Hemsworth and Brühl need to be mentioned. Olivia Wilde is stunning in a felinesque way. Her birth surname is Cockburn and the family includes a number of well-known journalists and diplomats. She has dual citizenship with the US and Ireland, which perhaps explains why she is able to pull off her Brit accent with such conviction. She's the model who marries Hemsworth and divorces him to run off with Richard Burton.Alexandra Maria Lara meets Brühl by accident and they're quickly married. She's extraordinarily beautiful but in a quite different way from Wilde. Wilde radiates sexuality. She might consume you. But Lara, both in appearance and demeanor, suggests a gentler kind of love, quieter, less demonstrative, less feral, more nurturing. The women match the men they marry very well.It's a well done picture, not part of the usual Hollywood effluvium.</fullReview>

Was in a those typical movie with his girlfriend Fridays, was eager to see the movie, since many sites that talk about the scene automobile spoke very well even before launch. I confess I was surprised because I was expecting a positive film were only racing! And no, I believe the key point of the film was overcoming and respect! Some days before, I watched with my the actual bride Lauda accident on youtube, reconstitution of the scene becomes so perfect that at the time she spends on the screen, the pressure from my fiancée comes to the download of the film in both involved. The soundtrack is fantastic (I downloaded both to hear the car), the actors are perfect, I believe it was an injustice to the Oscars best supporting actor have not been for Daniel Brühl, he Niki Lauda played so well that it gave the impression that it was actor main, it is also worth mentioning that for me was by far the best performance of Chris Hemsworth. I recommend more! (Despite being super fan dubbing, I recommend watching the subtitled film because the voice actor of Lauda failed to transpose the emotion in the speech given by actor, beyond that the tone and manner of speech has little to do with either the actor or with the original) niki. Good movie!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Rush was surprisingly good, there wasn't anything weak about it. The transition in stories between the two characters was exceptional, and it was really good to see that Chris Hemsworth went away from playing his Thor character (which he struggled to do in Snow White and the Huntsman), he created a fresh new character for himself.Rush went away from your standard sport movies like Boxing and Golf and I think in doing this Ron Howard created something original. Fabulous acting and very good visuals when needed, especially the Japanese Grand Prix at the end.What this film did well was that even though its a biopic, you still found yourself routing for Hunt in the end, and I think that's very important in a sport film or a biopic.Daniel Bruhl definitely stole the show in terms of performance, you go from hating the guy to having complete respect for the character and I think this performance really should boost his career as a versatile character.Overall Rush may not be everyone's cup of tea, but even if you're not a fan of F1 I would still recommend this feature because Ron Howard has managed to make another incredible picture and I think it is up their with A Beautiful Mind as one of the best Ron Howard has made.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have no interest in motor racing (or the history of the sport), however, I will confess to actually enjoying this film. Yes, it has enough of a budget to include some (pretty realistic) re-enactments of motor racing from the seventies (when it's set), but don't think that that's all there is here.It's based on the real life rivalry between two formula one drivers in the seventies. Now, normally when you have a film like this, one of the drivers is the 'goodie' and one is the 'baddie.' However, here, both have their pros and cons and sometimes you'll find yourself rooting for Thor (joke) and sometimes for the other one (not Thor).It's basically a good drama with some entertaining driving scenes thrown in. If you can forgive Thor's (slightly dubious) 'British' accent, then you'll probably have a good time. I hear from what I've read on the internet that it's actually quite a historically accurate representation of what went on in the seventies, so bonus points for ? apparently ? getting it right.http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Visually Stunning and Masterfully Written</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have been aware of the film "Rush" for some time now, but until recently, I had not made the plunge. It's now been three days since i've seen the film and I must say, it resonated with me unlike any movie i've seen recently. With a masterful script, fantastic acting, a very captivating score by Hans Zimmer, and great direction by Ron Howard(who is apparently a big F1 fan. Who knew?), "Rush" delivers in every facet a good movie should. "Rush", based on real events, takes place during the 1970's, centering around two up and coming Formula racers by the names of Niki Lauda and James Hunt. Lauda and Hunt serve as the protagonists of the film(or protagonist/antagonist, depending on how you wish to look at it), with the story revolving around their lives starting in the lowly F3 racing circuit all the way to their legendary 1976 F1 season showdown and beyond. What makes this story so compelling is the relationships and forces that occur between Lauda and Hunt. Both are vehement enemies on the track, but it's quite obvious that they hold a mutual respect for one another. The competition that unfolds between the two rivals over the course of the film is part of what makes "Rush" shine; both racer's desire to win is fueled by the success of the other. I came into this movie knowing almost nothing about F1 racing, yet I found myself completely enthralled in the details of the sport, and what made both Lauda and Hunt incredibly successful during their careers. Ron Howard truly did a fantastic job keeping me captivated despite my ignorance of the sport coming into the film. While the script and direction of this film is indeed very good, the acting is even better. Chris Hemsworth and Daniel Brühl are simply stunning as James Hunt and Niki Lauda, and are a big part of why this film succeeds. Both actors nail their respective characters, delivering truly life-like recreations of who these people were. After watching the movie, I looked up several videos and interviews with both Lauda and Hunt and was completely awestruck at how accurate they were portrayed. Daniel Brühl was especially convincing as Niki Lauda. You must also give a great deal of credit to the casting crew and makeup crew for picking and crafting such perfect actors for the job. At the end of the film you will see a few clips of Lauda and Hunt from the 70's, and the resemblance between them and the actors who played them is pretty astounding. The supporting cast is also good to very good, with some very well known names such as Olivia Wilde and Natalie Dormer. Overall, the acting in this film is simply top notch. With a witty script supported by some truly inspirational acting and directing, "Rush" delivers an intense, realistic experience of the 1970's F1 racing world. While the actual race scenes only account for a portion of the film, they are immensely exciting and only add to the overall experience of this character driven movie. You don't have to be an F1 fan to enjoy "Rush", and you may even find yourself interested in the sport after watching it. Whatever your interests might be for seeing this movie, don't let the subject material sway your decision. If you do, you may just miss out on one of the best movie's made this decade. For a truly encapsulating and resonating experience, I give "Rush" a rare 9/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You don't have to be a car fanatic or a F1 enthusiast to watch this. You don't even have to like movies, and this will pin you down to your seat. The story, the colors, the intrigue between the drivers, the racing, the accidents and above all? The true story! Forget the "Fast and the furious" series, forget the movies where you neglect scenes of "that would never happen in real life". This will make you search you-tube for the original races after the race and you will find remade scenes as it happened back at that time when it happened. Actors did an amazing job in my opinion as well, and if you look for the preproduction, Daniel Brühl, talks about how he spent time with Niki Lauda so he can be as close to his character as he can be. More than well done. Its brilliant.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I came into watching this movie with an open mind, initially thinking eh it may not be that great, but as minute after minute rolled, the movie kept driving my interest. Stunning showcase of special effects, flawless screen play, and a story that Shakespeare couldn't match, OK that may have been a bit extreme, but you catch my drift. This movie is the Days Of Thunder of Formula One and the modern movie era. The rivalry is there, the love, the tragedy, and most of all, the moving compassion that nearly anyone can find themselves in. This movie is a must watch, or a must have. An instant classic, not only involving two of the best drivers in any race sport, but also covering the most renown and loved race sport ever. This is a movie I would recommend to everyone, especially those who like, biography, drama, action, and history.Definitely worth the watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>RUSH Was a Surprise Gem for this Non-Race Fan</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I will always appreciate a movie that can generate my interest in something that I previously couldn't care less about. In the case of RUSH, that something is racing. Specifically, Formula-1 racing. RUSH is another in a long line of films based on actual events to come out in 2013 and it ranks right up there with the best of them. It receives bonus points for the fact that those involved in the original events claim RUSH to actually be pretty accurate in its details, with a little creative liberty taken by the filmmakers to jazz it up a bit. It's the story of a rivalry that captured international attention in the 1976 Formula-1 racing season. James Hunt (Chris Hemsworth) and Niki Lauda (Daniel Brühl) are very different men and both of them are incredibly talented drivers. The movie begins as the two struggle to make their mark on the Formula-3 circuit and follows their rise into the spotlight of Formula-1 in the pursuit of the world championship. As the two battle neck-and-neck for position, their rivalry fuels them to push harder and faster until a disastrous moment changes both their lives and professional relationship. RUSH has become my favorite film from director Ron Howard (note: I've never seen APOLLO 13 so that could change. I know, blasphemy.) and is probably one of my top favorite movies from the year. It succeeded at both making racing interesting to a non-fan while crafting two incredibly interesting characters who are competing for polar opposite reasons.For starters, I'm one of those anti-NASCAR sorts who can't be bothered to watch a bunch of people "drive in circles" for hours on end. For me to willfully watch a movie about the sport of racing (and, yes, I'm aware there's a difference between NASCAR and Formula-1 racing), it took a healthy batch of glowing positive reviews. And RUSH received heaps of praise when it hit. When combined with Chris Hemsworth's rising stardom thanks to his role as Thor in the Marvel cinematic universe (of which I'm a fan), it was enough to get my attention and I'm so glad I gave it a shot. RUSH is a blast, from the edge-of-your-seat racing segments to the back-and-forth trash talk between two talented professionals on opposite sides of the coin. Hunt is a daredevil. He drives for the thrill of the ride and revels in how close he comes to death with each event. He's in it for the glory. Lauda is a meticulous man. He uses a keen business sense in conjunction with his racing skill to master his craft. He's in it for the respect. The two ideologies bumping heads is what powers RUSH and keeps the audience invested. As cool as the racing segments are, they're nothing compared to the moments with the racers themselves. As I understand, a lot of the racing was done in camera with a minimal amount of CG to enhance the visuals. It helps, as the Formula-1 races and fast and brutal and CG cars would've dulled any sense of danger. And the movie isn't shy about showing the downsides to the Formula-1 lifestyle. Racers died in the sport (at least two a year at the time, if the movie is to be believed) and the excitement of the race circuit is intercut with the occasional accident to remind the viewer of the stakes.Chris Hemsworth and, especially, Daniel Brühl should've received more attention for their performances here. There was a lot of praise when the movie debuted but it had fizzled before awards season hit. Chris Hemsworth is commendable but Hunt isn't exactly a character that strikes me as outside his wheelhouse. Hunt is boisterous and often drunk; he's a daredevil with a mean party streak and Hemsworth fills the role perfectly. He's your typical jock in most regards but he's got the added bonus of obsession of staring death in the face. But he's not a total jerk and we see a welcome change in him in the final third of the movie following the disaster at Nürburgring. Brühl has the meatier role here in Niki Lauda. His performance is mesmerizing whenever he's on screen. He's such a peculiar man. Born in Austria, Lauda is abrasively candid, unafraid to call out Hunt for his dangerous race habits or tell the owner of Ferrari that his newest racer is a pile of garbage. His no-holds-barred nature and the fact that he bought his way into Formula-1 with personal loans earn him some enemies and ultimately contributes to his near fatal accident. Hemsworth may have the star power and top billing in the film but this is definitely Brühl's film in the end. Regardless, Howard does a fantastic job of balancing each character in the film, giving us the film from both perspectives. There's no hero and villain here. Just two men with a drive to be world champions.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a surprise!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As i consider myself a die hard race car fan. And a frequent movie goer. And yet i did 2 things wrong before sitting for RUSH. I didn't know about the rivalry between JAMES HUNT and NIKI LAUDA in the '70s. And second thing is i didn't know its a Ron Howard movie. So i started watching the movie with an open mind. Thought, lets see what The Thor has in store for me. But boy i was wrong, so wrong. This is not some Chris Hemsworth show. The character played by Daniel Bruhl was incredible, and stronger than Chris Hemworth's one in some extent. From the get go this movie will suck you into the world of this two mad rivals. I thought, "okay this is a movie about formula 1, but in the end the hero will come out as a winner." Again... how wrong i was! Both characters are so strong and so well acted by Chris Hemsworth and Daniel Bruhl that you will be confused, which guy to root for. They have their own reasons for their battles. Its story of the rivals from their point of views. I assure you that, you will love this rivalry and there growth in the process with your heart in you hand. Hunt is a playboy and a hot headed driver, on the other hand Lauda is calculative and great in setting up car. This is really battle between Heart v Brain. Though they are arch enemies but they have a certain respect for each other. When James Hunt beats down a reporter for humiliating Niki Lauda, that will give you chill. And for those who love Olivia Wilde, GOOD NEWS! She looks hot in this movie too. And Ron Howard did a great job, he is a great director and he proved it once again. Music are sublime and the color effect he used is amazing. I will give RUSH a 9. Go watch it, its worth the money and time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I first need to admit that I was not aware of the story between Lauda and Hunt prior to watching this movie. The names sounded familiar but I just thought they picked a similar name to real drivers like they usually do in racing movies. In a way, I think the director Ron Howard targeted the movie for viewers like myself as the movie didn't have the typical "Based on a true story" title at the beginning. Only the real pictures at the end was what caused me to think 'could this be true story?' and look it up to my surprise once again that such dramatic story is in fact true.Again, as I was not aware this was true story, mid way through the movie, I thought, 'wow, this is very well written drama'. This was completely opposite of modern day Formula 1 races and certainly unlike any Hollywood movies these days. Ending was completely unpredictable.Attention to detail was amazing. All the criticisms about shameful racing movies like Days of Thunder and Driven were well addressed. Crashes were so well reproduced that I thought the crashes in the movie were from actual footage.But then again, core of any movie should be about story telling. And there's no one better to tell such drama than Ron Howard. I don't give out perfect score often and this is only my second movie to be rated 10 stars on IMDb.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film is just over 2 hours long, but when it was over it seemed like I had been in the cinema about 30 minutes. The film centres on the battle for the 1976 Formula 1 World Championship, and the rivalry between the Austrian Nikki Lauda and the British playboy James Hunt. The two are depicted as enemies, but in actual fact they were good friends who trusted and respected each other on, as well as off-track. This bit of artistic licence does not spoil the film and is reasonable in order to make the battle between the two for the F1 crown more intense. These two characters are total opposites but as their lives are explored it also acknowledges the value of an enemy, something to beat. I believe this is a commentary on human nature in that the best of us shines when we have something to beat or overcome. movie is very good made, but some scenes could be extended a little more</fullReview>

There are many great rivalries in the formula one; the best being of course Senna Vs Prost before that they had never seen anything like Hunt and Lauda! It was biblical and very aptly shown by Ron Howard. He knows how to direct a biography and this was no easy task. He has used appositely filters to get every emotion from every scene. There is hair rising, spine tingling excitement from the race scenes it's like actually being there to experience the races. With some people you just can't fight and win, you just can't blame your lucky stars, u just can't compete with all the power in the world; some people are just born to do what they do, some people are just Great!</fullReview>

Rush sums up rivalry between two great racers in the 70s. The script has managed to show the astounding attitude and perseverance of both the protagonists without takings sides. The cinematography is one of the best I've seen in the past year. Even though I had very little expectations from Chris Hemsworth, I was expecting a bomb from Ron Howard. And he's absolutely delivered it. Rush will imply you towards the death defying sports for better. The movie will raise your adrenaline levels, please your eyes with its visuals and bound to captivate your moods with its amazing script; that too without a rush.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes. It is true. It is an amazing movie.There may be several reasons for that. The story is good. The idea behind the plot is more than decent, and the actors are more than suitable for their parts.Of course Ron Howard should take his part of the honor for the film. After all, he is main source of it. But one should be allowed to ask: What is it that makes Ron Howard's films so on the edge? Why is just he making so good movies?I can't answer that question. But I am sitting on the sidelines watching, expecting more. Looking forward to the next great Ron Howard adventure.Now, I have to say something about the technical side of the film. I like the camera angles. I like the vibrating strand of grass vibrating while the F1-cars are swooping past them. It really made me believe.The make-up of Daniel Brühl in the role as Niki Lauda is superb. Really superb. At least for those of us old enough to remember Lauda in the late 70's.Something else? The scene from the hospital where the medical staff are vacuuming Lauda's lungs, almost made me puke. It feels so real, that I could almost feel that pipe going down my throat.Well worth a 9'er.</fullReview>

It is not that focused around the race car driving and technical stuff, but much more around the clash between two opposite types of persons. and how they cope with their rivalry, life risks and pressure surrounding their personal life.The visuals where beautiful, with views of beautiful locations, moving cylinders and facial close-ups perfectly mixed, and the soundtrack was great without being too present. I highly recommend this film for people with sports and car interests,but also for people who like great camera work and cinematography. I wouldn't really expect it to draw a massive female audience, but again, its mainly a dramatic plot circulated around the races, so its not exactly a fast and furious type of film. ;)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Fantastic Biopic, One of The Best I've Seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This biopic film tells the story of James Hunt (Chris Hemsworth) and Niki Lauda (Daniel Brühl) as they climb to the top of Formula racing back in the 1970s. Director Ron Howard chose two actors who, not only resemble their real life counterparts, but also embody their characters and the drive (no pun intended) to be the best. The dual narrative followed each of the drivers as they overcame struggles and challenges along their journey, which worked perfectly for this film. Lauda and Hunt both viewed the world, risk and racing completely differently, which ultimately gave me two very different possible ways that I could look at life, either as if I will die tomorrow or with cost-benefit analysis, acting logically.Prior to watching this film, I knew absolutely nothing of the Formula One rivalry or the tragic crash that very nearly ended the career of Lauda. This made the film much more exciting as I was never sure what the outcome of the races would be or who would die and when and left me on the edge of my seat for the whole two hours. I would highly recommend this film to any one who, like me, enjoys biographical films.9/10</fullReview>

The racing in the movie was captured beautifully, this was a dangerous time in auto racing, before Nomex, crumple zones and safety standards, and they did a great job with it. The relationship between Lauda and Hunt is also captured beautifully, a love/hate, but respectful relationship.

		<fullReview>Rush covers the world championship in Formula One racing in the 1970s when two drivers dominated the sport: James Hunt of England driving a McLauren and Niki Lauda, an Austrian who drove for Ferrari. The two men had a lot in common. They were fortunate sons of wealthy families. They were obsessed with winning. While Hunt was a playboy, he was willing to die on the race track to gain a split-second advantage over his competition. Lauda spoke of cutting risk, which he could quantify, but he accepted the risk of tragic consequences of piloting race cars at insane speeds.If you like auto racing, you will love this story. The story contrasts how Lauda and Hunt were different. Lauda was a serious person who never worried about people liking him. He called everyone an "asshole." He was extremely frank and lacked any form of tact. Hunt was handsome, fun- loving, drunk and utterly charming. The desire to be better than the other man drove them to excel. Where once they really didn't like each other, they become more than rivals. Wonderful film. See it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's really difficult to accomplish more with such a contained budget. The storytelling is perfectly constructed in emotion, timing and contents.The characters and actors are perfectly matched and chosen. It's like going back to the sixties and feel a former and already past Knight's rivalry and a world completely amazed by them, when the F1 was the only and greatest hero's entertainment in a global scale. The F1 GP's ambient and the environment (costumes, scenarios, tracks, etc...) is perfectly recreated (surely after a true and huge researching job), but noticing that fantastic job, the director reaches to let it all stay in a second frame when Hunt or Lauda come into the screen. Just as it should be!!Thanks to Ron Howard and all his team to make the first true Car racing movie and to establish a new standard in quality, entertainment, and commitment to transfer the sportsmanship spirit, the pilot personalities and the story to the big public with responsibility and care. I had a great time watching this movie and recommend it to anyone who likes films or any Car Racing fan (former or actual), to learn and enjoy what racing was about in the 70's.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nicki Lauda's struggle and successes brought to life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The full personalities of F1 racing drivers were never really revealed back in the 1970s. It was all about the vicarious thrills of speeding of the cars, crashes, shunts and the chequered flag. We saw the drivers spraying large bottles of champagne around, but we did not get to care what they were really like or much about the technique of racing. So the full enormity of Nicki Lauda's quick recovery from his burns to getting back into the driver's seat did not get properly examined at the time. Ron Howard's film redresses this by revealing the brilliant mind of Lauda, his crises, his struggles and his professionalism. It also, of course, shows the swashbuckling bravado of James Hunt and the glamour he brought to F1. The only criticism I would make was the film's budget could have been used to better bring alive some of the exotic locations, such as the final 1976 race off next to Mount Fuji, which heavily relies on computer graphics.</fullReview>

And let me just say, they couldn't have been better. The direction is AMAZING. Focusing on those curves, gravel from the tires, head to head racing views, the audience enthusiasm, weather conditions, the pit crew, the celebrations, everything was spot on!But to my surprise that's not what I loved about the movie. What I absolutely loved was the portrayal of Hunt &amp; Lauda by the actors. Their friendly rivalry, the passion, the courage, the decisions, the situation handling, the press conferences. But mostly the passion for the sport be it for different reasons. The ending was incredibly suitable and great too.I simply loved it. An undoubted 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's my first review on IMDb. I normally don't feel compelled to tell others what I think of a movie. But I couldn't resist the temptation to publicly congratulate the team behind this film, for the most amazing rendition of the F1 world in its heyday - and for portraying in such an authentic and touching manner a slice of life of two amazing and so very different individuals. As Lauda said (in more interviews and with more emotions than I ever thought the man could master), it truly is a pity that James Hunt is no longer here to enjoy this work.Well done, Hollywood needs to learn from you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let me be very honest.I was never an admirer of chris hemsworth nor of a biographical,as i have always seen manipulation in the real story.But this movie has turned me otherwise.it was an Excellent movie,never expected the kind of emotion portrayed between rivals.It was heart ranching,mesmerizing and at the same time hell entertaining.The era depicted in the movie has been shown quite excellently.The cars,fashion even the hairstyle takes you back to the 1970's.The stunts performed,(well who so ever has performed) were fantastic.The acting was superb.Hemsworth and Bruhl are fantastic, particularly Hemsworth, who's accent, mannerisms and natural acting was a big surprise. I could see a few awards for this role and the message underneath was excellent.Ron Howard has done it again with the biography.A sure shot winner.Recommended for all age groups,go for it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Slick F1 film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rush is about the rivalry between James Hunt (who I've never heard of personally) and Niki Lauda leading up to the 1976 World Championship. Lauda is very accurately played by Brühl and Hemsworth is excellently cast as arrogant playboy Hunt. Ron Howard succeeds in making a visually very slick movie for the low budget of 38m$. A lot of stuff is CGI enchanced, mostly you don't notice it, but a couple of times you could notice they are in front of a bluescreen instead of in a car. They also used real cars and most of the racing shots look very real. Hans Zimmer provides a very functional score that doesn't draw to much attention to itself. I enjoyed this movie a lot and I would certainly recommend it to any car enthusiast or F1 fan but I won't put it in my 2013 top 5 film list. Like a lot of movies about sports and rivalry therein it feels like it follows a certain formula and unfolds in a very straightforward way. This keeps it from reaching 'instant classic' status, but don't let that keep you from seeing this fine film</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Best part of watching true stories are the inspirational and motivational factors. The feeling of watching a spectacular era gone by on the silver screen is pretty exciting. Rush will bring the thrills and adrenaline in you.Rush ,set is 1970's , tells the story about the rivalries between the famous Formula One racers Niki Lauda and James Hunt.From the director of critical acclaim movies like Apollo 13, A Beautiful Mind and Cindrella Man - Ron Howard takes you for a roller coaster ride which is fulfilled with action that is breath-taking, drama that holds your attention and emotions that is heart-wrenching. The screenplay is the hero of the film that is stupendous. Full marks should be given to extra-ordinary cinematography for impressive shots of Formula One races. Art direction is brilliant. Dialogues are outstanding. Chris Hemsworth is getting better with each film. He gets into the character of James Hunt with T. Daniel Brühl steals the thunder with flawless performance as Niki Lauda.A brilliant movie in every sense. Highly recommended - 4.5/5</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a characterisation of 2 awesome people.!! Initially it looked like battle but it turned out a "sport". None can tell how much they actually respect each other but if 20% of the climax of this movie is true then I can say that they were really legends. Bruhl deserves applaud for his accent and mannerisms. And about Chris Hemsworth, his performance is brilliant. The set pieces about both characters are really interesting. Some of them are not true but anyways this is documentary. It's a treat for the people who like F1 and racing cars. It's one of the top films of the year 2013. Last words: "Genius". "Thrilling".

		<fullReview>First you should not have any doubts concerning whether to watch this movie or not because i had the same doubts and i thought to myself "I'm not a big fan of sport movies or formula 1 (which i personally don't condenser a sport..or at least not a physical one) " Rush is not about speed and cars but it's about competition ,passion and proving what winning is really about.This movie captures you from it's first scene by showing that something big is going to happen on that 1976 rainy august day specially if you don't have a background on the true story behind the movie.It starts there and takes us back in time to all the stories,events and struggles shaped that day in a very tens and full of action way. Daniel Brühl did a very good role and he manged to makes us hates his character but at the end maybe loves him and feel proud of him. The Sounds are amazing and i mean all the sounds.. effects the mixing and surly the music score that only to know that Hans Zimmer is the composer behind it is enough to find it brilliant</fullReview>

You will see courage and real sports as it was in the time where death- statistics were not on the driver's side. Good acting is supported by references to real-life situations so it ads to the credibility of the movie.The only objection I can noticed was that at some moments you have a feeling that some scenes were shortened which is pity but except that, highly recommendable movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is really out of my expectation. It is a nice movie and no boring scene from the start to the finish. 2 roles with 2 different characteristics. One prefers to race safely and one prefers to take risk. The content of the film perfectly and clearly describe the 2 attitudes from them. Both actors, of course, performed so well:). I don't know about much history about them but the scene where Niki tried to race again after the terrible accident really touches my heart. A good expression in the theme which moves me. I think i will be perfect ending if they met again after Niki still won the championship in 1984. Overall, i will recommend this movie to my friends no matter he's a racing fan or not.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>When not watching the trailer would have paid off</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Trailers these days ruin movies more than Kevin Costner could ever hope to achieve. The trailer for this movie is kind of an anti-trailer. I was fooled into thinking that I was about to watch a movie about Chris Hemsworth's character, which isn't too much of a stretch considering he must have at least 75% of the scenes in the trailer.But this was not Chris Hemsworth's movie, far from it. This was Daniel Brole(?)'s movie. I added a question mark because I still don't know his name after watching the trailer, the movie and consequently obsessing over the information surrounding the actual events. It's either Brole or Brule and it has an accent. I'm still on the trailer, there's more to be said. It was one of the best trailers in recent history, simply due to the fact that it didn't give the entire movie away. If I hadn't seen the trailer before watching the movie, I don't think I would have had the same experience. Not only did it not spoil the movie, it prepared me for some obscure historical event from the bottom of the bag being massacred into a motion picture.wow incoherent rambling review much? such amaze so wow. All I've done was talk about the trailer. 10 stars 100% on rotten tomatoes. There are some amazing movies that you'd never want to watch again, I'll see in five or ten years if this one is one of them. I've watched National Lampoon's Senior Trip (Jeremy Renner's first role) at least a dozen times, but it's a pretty terrible movie. Rush is good rush is great it was my favourite movie this year it kinda played out like an Ayn rand novel and I wonder if Niki Lauda was into her at all, since he seems.... kinda fricked (WHY CAN'T I USE PROFANITY IN MY REVIEW, THAT'S INSANE IT'S 2013 GET YOUR STUPID STUFF TOGETHER GUYS.

		<fullReview>'RUSH': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)Director Ron Howard's critically acclaimed sports drama about the 1976 Formula One season rivalry between drivers James Hunt and Niki Lauda. Chris Hemsworth (of 'THOR' fame) and Daniel Bruhl star as the two champion drivers. Peter Morgan wrote the screenplay and he's well known for writing critically acclaimed award winning historical dramas, usually centering around the relationship between two people (like 'THE LAST KING OF Scotland', 'THE QUEEN' and another Ron Howard directed film 'FROST/NIXON'). This is another great example of the kind of storytelling Morgan is great at and Howard does an amazing job bringing it to life as well!The film traces Hunt (Hemsworth) and Lauda's (Bruhl) rivalry back to their first meeting at a 1970 Formula Three race in England. Hunt won that battle but Lauda then went on to 'buy his way in' to Formula One racing by taking out a loan and joining the Scuderia Ferrari team in 1975. Hunt's underdog team Hesketh Racing also entered the Formula One season that year but couldn't find sponsors and was forced to drop out after just that season (which Lauda won). Hunt then entered the 1976 competition as part of McLaren's team and (with a much better automobile to operate) became strong competition for Lauda that year. The film chronicles their obsessive rivalry and their lives off the track (Hunt being a wild 'lady's man' and Lauda being a calculated nerd). It also focuses on their relationships with two women (played by Olivia Wilde and Alexandra Maria Lara).I knew little about the sport (at that time, or any really) and hadn't heard about Hunt or Lauda or their rivalry (prior to seeing the film) but I was still glued to the screen and totally involved. I could really relate to the passion and drive of both characters (I find myself ideally wanting to be more like Hunt but could understand both men). For me the movie was very moving in that way. Hemsworth has mostly just been known as an action movie star up to this point but this film finally gives him the chance to show off his acting abilities for a change (which are impressive). Bruhl is equally amazing in his role (probably more so) and totally becomes Niki Lauda. I can't say how accurate the film is but I do know the real Lauda loved it (Hunt passed away years ago) and said "There was no Hollywood changes or things changed a little bit Hollywood-like. It is very accurate. And this really surprised me very positively". I think Morgan's script really made the film work but also Howard's directing. Howard is well respected by critics and audiences alike but some cinephiles (that think they're smarter than everyone else) like to call him a hack; 'a director that just tries to make commercial friendly Oscar bait'. I disagree. I think sometimes his lesser films come off that way but he's definitely put a lot of heart and talent into making a lot of great films as well (and this is one of them). The cinematography (by Anthony Dod Mantle) is gorgeous and the score music (by Hans Zimmer) is beautiful and breathtakingly moving as well (some of the best I've heard in any film all year). It's a film not to be missed!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-D0yOH-Zx4</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I haven't watched Formula One racing before but by the end I found it difficult to look away</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the racing circuit of the 1970s, drivers James Hunt and Niki Lauder were the fiercest of rivals and represented the sport's partition between glamour and science. Hunt was born in 1947 in London and Lauder was born in 1949 in Austria. Yet both men had similar economic and personal backgrounds. Hunt's father was a successful stockbroker and Lauder was from a family of businessmen. Their families were unsupportive of their decision to shun their wealthy heritage in favour of becoming racing car drivers. Hunt at one point considered being a doctor. 1976 is remembered to be one of the most dramatic years in the Grand Prix's history and by that point they had developed polar reputations for themselves. Hunt was a drinker, took drugs, vomited before every race and is said to have slept with over five thousand women. Alternately, Lauder was characterised as "cold, hard logic" and a technical expert on driving. He became a major advocator for driver safety in the sport. In Ron Howard's fictional account of this rivalry, Hunt and Lauder are played with great lucidness by Chris Hemsworth (Thor, The Avengers) and Daniel Bruhl (Inglourious Basterds). We come to understand the mindsets of both men and ironically how they complimented each other. As Hunt Chris Hemsworth brims with high charisma, cockiness, wit and arrogance. He doesn't care about others but uses them for a fleeting moment of joy or pleasure. In his first scene, he walks into a hospital bleeding with a bandage on his stomach and seduces the nurse. The danger of racing fuels this juvenile spontaneity because 'the closeness to death' reminds him of his own personal vitality and celebrity appeal to women. Peter Morgan's screenplay adopts a structure similar to Martin Scorsese's Raging Bull, where sex and sport have a synonymous relationship. For Hunt, both are a moment of passion, instinct and adrenaline and sometimes inspire each other. In one sequence Hunt seduces an air hostess onboard a plane and the scene is juxtaposed against a revitalised and energised racing performance. Outside of racing and sex, Hunt is bored and directionless. His brief marriage to Suzy Miller (Olivia Wilde) is a disaster because he can't handle a structured life. Ron Howard's camera makes deliberate note of the image of a bird trapped in a cage. It's an image representative of both characters because even Miller takes up with the actor Richard Burton to escape her life with Hunt. Comparatively, Lauder doesn't believe in popularity, partying or even friends. He is a lone wolf because it allows him to structure and discipline his life primarily around racing. Not only is Lauder unpopular with the other racers in the film, he is an outsider to his own racing team, an Austrian who is part of a major Italian racing company in Ferrari. He believes that 'happiness is the enemy' because when you are happy you suddenly have something to lose. His strength though comes in the form of his scientific approach to racing and his logic. He orders the material on his racing car to be changed so it runs faster and manoeuvres his way around contracts to improve his own standing with the team. Typifying his character, Hunt calls him a rat but Lauder reminds him that as disliked as they are rats are also very cunning creatures. The accident that left Lauder horribly burnt and scared on top of his head is a frightening story and powerfully handled because of the uncompromised staging. He returned to racing just six weeks later, wearing a special protective cap under his helmet to hide his burnt flesh. The physical pain is viewed in graphic detail but we also see a determination in Lauder that achieves obsessive tendencies. While having his lungs pumped, the point of view shots of the TV showing Hunt celebrating injects Lauder with unflinching tenacity and competitiveness. If there is any disappointment with the film it is that the female partners of both men, including Lauder's eventual wife Marlene (Alexandra Maria Lara), aren't given proper character arcs but are moral ciphers for their domestic issues or marginalised to the sidelines. The majority of the film's energy is spent on the racing scenes, which are an exhilarating from inside the cockpit, with cameras attached to the helmets of the actors, or over the top of the race through overhead shots. Occasionally, it is not always clear which driver is which. Pay attention to the colour of the racing cars. The most terrifying sequence in the film is when they race in terrible conditions during a downpour in Japan, forcing Lauder to reconsider his ideal that he has nothing to lose. The atmosphere in the racing scenes is heightened by an intensely desaturated colour scheme. The palettes are gritty and dark, focussing the sole primary colour red onto the racing car. This shows nothing exists outside of racing for these two men. The film is about their relationship and rivalry but also the way other people can teach us about ourselves. What they see in each other places a mirror onto themselves, reminding them of their own personal strengths. It breathes a small degree of respect between these two competitors. Hunt died at just forty-five but Lauder is still alive. He has said that he approves of the film because of its truthfulness. I haven't watched Formula One racing before but by the end I found it difficult to look away. It has the rare privilege of combining exciting Hollywood spectacle with two intimate and fascinating characters.</fullReview>

The action scenes and cars really build the tension and put you in the driver's seat, and the hot Women! Phew!In today's world the grit and determination of the drivers to compete would be nixed by a committee of lawyers and liability experts.Really enjoyed this movie; the script, the acting, the real cars and driving.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There is no Tom Sawyer, Limelight, or even a Getty Lee in this "Rush"; but it does not matter, because for those who wish to dream seeing a great movie, they should steer over to the movie "Rush". Director Ron Howard's masterpiece is based on the real life rivalry between 70's Formula One Drivers James Hunt and Niki Lauda. Hunt being the playboy &amp; carefree one, while Lauda is more of the standoffish but focused one. Chris Hemsworth accelerated his serious acting career with a grand performance as Hunt. But it was Daniel Bruhl that won this acting race by putting it up in Oscar-worthy gear with his winning performance as Lauda. Howard geared the film with precise precision in his direction. Peter Morgan's script was riding, I mean writing high with right lanes, I mean lines. So yes I am rushing you to see this movie because it had the right formula. ***** Excellent</fullReview>

I was unaware of the story of Niki Lauder and James Hunt but after watching the film, I was interested in learning more about these dare devils and their lives building up to the very last race. watching real races online and reading about the drivers has made more interested in race car driving and made me aware of how dangerous these professionals have it.I recommend this movie to anyone that appreciates top acting, directing and overall filmmaking. 5 stars.</fullReview>

To enjoy this film even more you need to look the behind the scenes in Youtube and see Niki Lauda talking for real and the actor who portrayed him... oh my God!

		<shortDescription>Rush</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ron Howard delivers an adrenaline-high, well-paced, expertly photographed ode to 70s Grand Prix racing, following the thrilling rivalry between calculating, brilliant, but cold and not-quite-ingratiating Austrian, Niki Lauda (Daniel Brühl) and party-hearty, womanizing, handsome buck, James Hunt (Chris Hemsworth). The dueling egos, bravado, swapped barbs rippling with honesty, and incredible talent of both men makes for some high drama. Every cinematic trick (the ways Howard shoots the cars during races and reactions towards all the key dramatic moments, such as Lauda's tormented near-death experience thanks to burns from his car's fire consumption and agonizing hospital recovery and the rainy Japanese final formula race that Hunt narrowly survives to win the world championship) Howard uses to create a marvel of visual power. I think the racing is what many will come to this film for, and that will not disappoint. There's also a pretty damn good story here, too. It's a biopic about racing legends who drove each other to be as good as they could be. Howard knows how to recreate history on film and he carefully avoids the pratfalls that could belie a 70s biopic through cunning editing and avoiding taking Rush away from the track too much. Both leads match their real-life personas, not only looking like them but providing gravitas to these characters to give them dimension. I love fast cars and them racing in competition tugs at my testosterone. Rush would fit perfectly in a double feature with John Frankenheimer's Grand Prix (1966). The rehab and return to racing after the burning for Niki is absolutely harrowing. There's no doubt that Hemsworth is a stud and has the right charisma to portray such a larger-than-life person as James Hunt. Niki's courage and guts after such suffering is quite astonishing. I personally consider Howard's Rush superior filmmaking.</fullReview>

And I didn't think about it at the time it was Ron Howard directed.I'm glad I got around to give this movie a view. It was excellent! Much more of a just "racing movie", much of a "human interest" type movie as well. Makes me wish back when I was a young lad I paid more attention to formula racing back in 1976'ish.The bottom line is even if you are not a big fan of racing you will probably really appreciate this movie and love it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It would be difficult for me to be less interested in racing, and I thought this film was terrific. It's fast paced, exciting, well-acted, informative and just good fun. What makes this movie is it's only nominally about racing--the interesting angle is the complex rivalry between James Hunt and Niki Lauda (and I would actually recommend NOT reading up about these two before you see the film--there is a major spoiler at the end if, like me, you check into their biographies first). They liked each other, they hated each other, they were polar opposites in their approaches to just about everything--racing and life--and yet they absolutely needed each other. What an interesting character study that elevates this film over the typical Days of Thunder-type of action film. I'll give a cheer for Chris Hemsworth, who does a great job portraying James Hunt--Hemsworth is one of the best actors at playing the Good Time Charlie-type of character (which I would argue is much of his charm in the first Thor film, except Thor grows up. Hunt doesn't). Okay, I do love looking at CH, and he can wear that long hair and those 70s outfits any time . . . but he's a darn good actor, too. How unfortunate this film didn't generate the popularity it deserves. I'd rate it one of the better films I've seen in the genre.</fullReview>

The rivalry between the flamboyant Hunt and the perfectionist Lauda makes this movie into an enthralling thriller.

		<shortDescription>First time I had to stop a movie midway to rate it and to write my first review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So, here's the thing, I'm a bit of a movie brat. If the film isn't rated at least a 7+ here, I'm probably not wasting my time on it. There are of course exceptions to that rule, a Luc Beson action film, Asian gangster films with Donnie Yen, anything with Liam Neesom and so forth. But for the most part, I'm very picky.I finally had a chance to watch Ron Howard's Rush. I'm actually watching it right now. I actually had to stop watching to the movie because I just needed to rate it RIGHT NOW. Maybe I should see a doctor about that...Irregardless(Puff Puff Pass reference), Seeing an 8+ rating, I already expected it to be a good. I would have to decide for myself if it was great, and I certainly didn't expect it to be near flawless. As a director, Ron Howard has a way of not only capturing the detailed reality of events whether real (Apollo 13) or fictional (Ransom) but to also show deep character development through dramatic events and vivid cinematography. Rush fits into all of those perfectly. For any car/racing enthusiasts, this is as clear and realistic as a movie will get for some time, non of these fake Fast &amp; Furious physics. For action buffs, the racing scenes rival the heart pumping fury of any Action film (maybe with the exception of The Raid, because that was craaazy!)For fans of detail and story, the movie seems accurate (as quick as I can wiki stuff) and well sculpted. Using something grand like F1 racing as a blanket, Howard shows the many true events and outcomes close-up that changed the lives of both drivers while the world watched them race from a distance. OK, so I waited to finish the film before giving my final rating, and without giving any details away, I would say nothing I wrote above has changed. This is on par with any directors masterpiece. I would not rate this an absolute 10, but it is certainly well over a 9, and given that IMDb does not use decimals, and given the fact that you can clearly see the effort put into this film, I will round up to 10.Cheers.Tig in SF</fullReview>

		<fullReview>in stark contrast to all other Hollywood influenced hyper feminized / homosexual agenda films coming out of Hollywood this year, this is the only one that have successfully managed to move all that ideological BS aside and produce a rear clean &amp; pure story telling as displayed by RUSH. free of the access brainwash/social engineering we're usually pumped with by Un-Holiwood.it was a grate story between to competitors told the right way, moving all non critical stuff aside with a grate dosage of adrenalin induced car racing &amp; the human story that drives this film and visual effects that are near seamlessly woven to the story and just help describe realty of races as it was.this film tells me that we do need Hollywood giants like Ron Howard because they (and only they) have the the power to tell Hollywood to stuff their agenda BS where it belongs, and produce such jam.Thank You Mr Howard for telling a grate man's story clear of all Hollywood gender/sex propaganda BS!salute!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>it's the best motor sport movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm a formula one fan since 2003.This sport is very different from any other sports.It is awesome because it contains technologies&#xff0c;talent&#xff0c; very large amount of money.I agree with Hamilton that formula one is more difficult than tennis.So each driver should be respected.And it must be more dangerous to drive a F1 car in 70s. There are some great rivals in formula one like Niki VS Hunt&#xff0c;Senna VS Prost and Schumacher VS Häkkinen. Among them,Niki and Hunt are the most dramatic.They are very different from each other and at first they were hostile but after a series of events, they started to understand each other and became real friends.For me,I like Niki.He was brave enough to give up game and be good at IQ and EQ.Although he was not good-looking, he was tough and be responsible for his family. Hans Zimmer's background music is really outstanding and promotes this movie.It's the best motor sport movie much better than The Fast and the Furious. (since I'm a big fan of Michael Schumacher, I hope he will get well soon.Pray for Schumi.)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Best movie I've seen in a long time. I never even heard of this movie. I did not know of this story which surprises me, although I was only 11 when this was happening, I knew of the hero's of golf, tennis, and many race drivers, not your main stream sports, but never heard of these guys. I'm really surprised. This is Ron Howard at his best. Chris Hemsworth does a fantastic job as James Hunt. I hardly can believe he is the same actor that plays Thor. Since I knew nothing of the real men, I purposely avoided looking up details so watching the movie was very suspenseful. Worth your time and then some. Daniel Brühl also does an amazing job as Niki Lauda. You have to give it to these guys. Great job.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Generally I don't like biographies and was not interested to watch this. A couple of my friends recommended me to watch it and I am happy I listened to them. This movie blew my mind, loved the story, it was excellently directed and was to the point, no unnecessary boring drama. All the actors have acted very well. The narrative is also superb. A very nice touch by showing the original Niki and James.The original Niki should have been provided with much more screen time. I feel they should have shown more into the future. It illustrates to us what a glorious past F1 had. I hope more such films will be produced. For those who like a good rivalry movie its a must watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's hard to describe what is the best part of this movie. The storyline is gripping. Ron Howard does ever so well to never take your eyes off the screen. As for the acting part, it is absolutely fantastic. Daniel Brühl and Chris Hemsworth are just about THE perfect cast they could have ever chosen to portray the two main characters in the movie.The racing sequences keep you at the very edge of your seats. The sound of burning tires and the commentator's cries of " Niki Lauda in the lead...and James Hunt gets in front...oh and again it's Lauda.." are sure to get your adrenaline pumped up throughout the movie.This year witnessed some truly memorable movies but in my opinion the movie of the year has to be RUSH. A truly must watch for racing and non racing fans alikeP.S : I was not an F1 fan, but I just had to give this a 10/10 rating :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>F1 has never seemed so cool.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Chris Hemsworth pulls in an immense and startling performance as the womanising "party guy" James Hunt. This is due to both the actors and characters changes and versatility during the film as he doesn't stay as this fun loving hot head but easily adapts to show a deeper and somewhat subtle version of the character. It is this sort of flexibility within the role that gives Hemsworth his edge and keeps you gripped to the screen during the intense scenes on and off the track.Hemsworths performance is easily matched by that of Daniel Brühls as the rule abiding and overly serious Niki Lauda. Brühl performance may seem a bit dull compared to the liveliness of Hemsworths take on Hunt, but this just adds to the authenticity and the chemistry that occurs between these two polar opposites.Despite this film revolving around the rivalry between these two characters, it is the great chemistry during their conflicts that keep this going and this is realised at the end when Lauda states that Hunt "is one of the few drivers he liked, and even fewer he respected". Ron Howard has a great knack for taking a subject that may seem dull such as an interview (Frost/Nixon) and making it seem incredibly intriguing. This applies greatly to Rush as it is a real fast &amp; furious film that pulls no stops in being daring or taking it slow round the corners.This brings me to my really only criticism; it is very long winded. I say this in the same sense that a film like Django Unchained feels long, but still keeps you engaged and ready for anything the film throws at you. Rush is exactly like this as it does move slowly, but it doesn't matter as you are too intrigued in this startling story to bother about the time going by.Visually, this film is spectacular. By this I don't mean that there are startling graphics and visual effects, but the cinematography and directorial style is top notch. Ron Howard had for some reason decided to put a golden yellow haze over most of the film, which gives an authentic feel to the film similar to the likes of Frost/Nixon or Argo.In the end Rush is an exhilarating thrill ride that keeps you enticed, even during the parts that seem slow. Visually the film is brilliant and there are stellar performance from both the lead and supporting actors and actresses.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>James Hunt's arrogance and snobbishness makes Niki Lauda's buck-teeth and resulting the lisp seem charming. It's amazing how much these two actors look and sound like their characters, the way Lauda speaks in clipped sentences, the way Hunt's like, "Yeah, whatever". I can't even drive, but the dialogue in this film is how race car drivers explain racing, from too fast in the corners, to rain on the track, to the grip on the tires. It's ironic that Lauda wanted to boycott the race he was hurt in. And I like how the film shows the way the right kind of adversity makes people better at what they do. The dark clouds covering the sun seem so literary I don't know how I feel about them in a film, but it was a good way to show the dread involved. I think the film could've been longer. I saw an interview with Ron Howard where he said it was hard to get it down to two hours, and I wish he'd made this three hours or so. It felt like a sample tray of these two men's lives. (Am I being too feminine here?) Although I wouldn't want anything weepy, a little go get'em, honey, would've warmed my little girl heart. (And can you tell I really couldn't stand the Englishman?) But as I'm writing this I know I'm wrong. It is a good film the way they have it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the human condition</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was not very enthusiastic about a racing movie, but it emanated, once I finished it, the flare of an epic tale and the scope of the human condition. Life is about speed; this allegory even has a name, namely 'red queen dynamics' (if you want to go forward in the biological realm, you need not to advance, but to advance quicker that you opponent). We may look upon this fact with moral judgments and ethical concerns, but it is just a fact really. Now, this does not take away, but really engages, and especially for us humans, things like solidarity, friendship, family and respect for your opponents strength and dignity. And also, on every round, the tough decision about getting into the fight, to take the race to pole position, or stepping out, putting at security not only our life, but also the one of those we love.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ron Howard is mostly known for his movies based on true stories/facts (apollo 13, A Beautiful Mind, Frost/Nixon) and this adds one more to the list. Unlike many Howard movies i've seen this one was more stylish with a different overall look which in my opinion gave it a more unnatural feel. All the racing scenes were cinematographed pretty good. Overall this movie is good, it is fast paced, with good acting, good cgi, and overall great in all technical departments though I would've given it 9 if the overuse of cgi could have prevented. Now when i say "Undermined by Critic", I'm talking about mostly Sound work. Sound mixing and editing were so great, those roaring engines did a good job of adding some adrenaline to the movie. This movie at least deserved nominations for Oscars specially in sound department. If you haven't watched this movie yet, I will highly recommend this movie to anyone. You can't miss it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very good rivalry movie for anyone!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>RUSHI have been wanting to watch this movie ever since I saw the trailer. I missed it in the cinema, but now it has been released on DVD.The movie is about a rivalry between two Formula One drivers. This rivalry wasn't like other rivalries... these guys really took it to the edge. They disliked each other as well as wanted to beat each other... but they respected each other.The movie was very good. I am a big Formula One fan and have been for many years. I am not old enough to remember the Niki Lauda/James Hunt rivalry, but I have heard of it and seen video clips. Niki and James are both legends in their sport and will remain that way forever. Niki is still a presence at the track these days as he works as a consultant for the Mercedes team and can be seen at almost every race.The action in the movie was very good and the racing scenes were very well put together. Ron Howard really is good at making a great action film.The film stars Chris Hemsworth and Daniel Bruhl. Both actors did a fantastic job and it is amazing how much Chris and Daniel actually look like James and Niki. It really is the perfect casting.There are some scenes in the film that were a bit awkward to watch. When Niki had his accident he went through a really harsh time through his treatment. Some of which was really horrible to watch. Niki went through as really hard timer, yet he still got back in the car the same year to finish the season. That man is crazy! I have so much respect for him. He was very determined and focused for his passion.Niki was not a very likable person. He took his career very seriously and he didn't care who he had to walk over to get what he wanted. He didn't have many friends and he didn't care. He wanted to be world champion and that was all he focused on. Weirdly though, I really liked him. He was very blunt and said what he thought no matter who got upset. I like honesty in people and that is a very good thing in Nikis favour. James on the other hand was the complete opposite. He was a playboy. He liked women, drink and drugs. He was sometimes deemed dangerous in the car, but he had a talent and was very good at what he did. There were times through the film where I didn't really like James. I thought his attitude sucked and he wasn't a very nice man at times. In the end though I felt sorry for him. His life went off the rails a little bit and I thought he maybe deserved a little bit more help than he got from the people around him.According to Niki this film is very close to the truth, which is a very good to know. I hate the fact that most true stories are full of untrue parts.I don't really have anything bad to say about this film. You will enjoy this film if you do not like F1, but you will enjoy it more if you do. I don't think it is Rons best film, but it is up there with the best of his career.I will give this film 8 out of 10."The closer you are to death, the more alive you feel. It's a wonderful way to live. It's the only way to drive."For more reviews, please like my Facebook page:https://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204?ref=hl</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great movie that tops all expectations.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Considering the unfortunately many poorly executed attempts at making racing inspired movies, my expectations of 'Rush' weren't all too high when I pressed the 'Play'-button on my DVD-player's remote control. I'm not familiar with Ron Howard's oeuvre, and with Chris Hemsworth being the only name on the cast that actually rang any bells, expectations from that side weren't very high either. I'm not saying that Hemsworth is a bad actor, but the movies I've seen him play in, weren't exactly my cup of tea.However, only a few minutes after the opening credits things started feeling right, very right. The movie, which tells the story of the legendary rivalry between F1 half-gods James Hunt and Niki Lauda, lends itself perfectly for a highly entertaining and interesting movie. Everything that Rush is. In terms of historical correctness there are a few things that aren't 100% correct, but these are minor and very few in numbers, but after all, this is a movie, not a documentary.The scenery is excellent, and features a very high attention to detail, especially concerning the race tracks and their respective environments. Also the cars used in the movie are spot on in terms of historical correctness, as well is the information concerning the actual races that took place back then. The director makes great use of historical footage from back then, such as television and radio broadcasts.The acting performances are superb, with special credit to both Hemsworth and Brühl, but also Alexandra Maria Lara gives stunning performance, especially when it comes to the emotional expressions that are probably spot on in terms of how a spouse of an actual race driver feels when he once again risks life and limb in pursuit of victory. The other actors and actresses showed great professionalism as well, and helped carry the movie to it's high quality status.Also the camera work is excellent. Nothing overly fancy or exaggerated bling bling, as I initially feared would be the case. On the contrary even, the director makes use of fairly standard filming techniques, but all catch the spirit of the movie, the characters and the actual races spot on. About the races : they are truly excellent, and brought to image in a way respectful to the day and age they took place in. The intensity of the duels is transmitted towards the viewer without the loss of even a single drop of sweat of the drivers faces. If I would have any complaint at all about the racing scenes in the movie then it is that there are too few of them, but then again, that's probably just the racing enthusiast and car nut inside of me that's speaking. For the movie itself the mix between high-action driving scenes and the more dramatic ones is near perfect, they support the depiction of the actual plot, which is the rivalry between two highly talented and competitive men in just the right amount.For those that aren't into cars or motor sports and that think this movie is nothing for them because of it's racing theme, don't fool yourselves. This is a great movie about the drama of two men in pursuit of their ultimate personal goal, and the effect this has on their respective surroundings. But it is also an excellent movie about mutual respect, braveness and chivalry as well as it is a respectful tribute to one of the most legendary pages in F1 history.My expectations were quite low before I started watching this movie, but they very quickly turned out to be totally mistaken. This is a truly great movie, and very well worth two hours of your life. Apart from that, as a car enthusiast, I am truly pleased to finally see a movie again that honors the love people like us have for these machines and the sport of racing them. It clearly shows that this movie was made by people who share this love and respect.Watch it, I promise you won't be disappointed.9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Everyone's driven by something' is the perfect tag line for this intense film by director Ron Howard and writer Peter Morgan that successfully revisits the sexy, glamorous golden age of Formula 1 racing in the 1970s. The film is based on the true story of a great sporting rivalry between handsome English playboy James Hunt (Chris Hemsworth), and his methodical, brilliant opponent, Austrian driver Niki Lauda (Daniel Brühl). The story follows their distinctly different personal styles on and off the track, their loves and the astonishing 1976 season in which both drivers were willing to risk everything to become world champion in a sport with no margin for error: if you make a mistake, you die. The love interest are provided by actresses Natalie Dormer, Olivia Wilde, Alexandra Maria Lara and the supporting cast is full of fine actors, Pierfrancesco Favino as Clay Ragazzoni among them.The film focuses as much on the internal struggles these opposite drivers had as much as it does on the racing tracks. Philosophical questions are raised that pertain to any sport and Ron Howard knows ho to bring that into focus. Both lead actors are exceptional, with Daniel Brühl - false teeth and all - turning in a fully realized performance as the severely burned but not battered Niki Lauda. This is an action film with doubt, but it is also a psychological dramatization of a true story that for once works very well on film.</fullReview>

While the movie "only" depicted the rivalry between James Hunt and Niki Lauda, in real life they were good friends. Both characters, James and Niki, were developed very thoroughly throughout the story. From the beginning, James and Niki operate on opposite sides of the spectrum. James want to risk everything he lives for to get the thrill of winning and compete in the race, while Niki competes to preserve life and enjoy the smallest of things. The movie in all of its glory resulted in men whose views on life are totally different and radical compete for the win of the century.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Can you handle the speed? If so this movie is for you. Rush an action based movie with an amazing storyline to keep you clenched to that seat, but makes you feel as if the movie just started. I saw Rush for the first time a few weeks ago through a screener copy and after feeling so exhilarated I just had to go see this under the big screen with the roaring speakers. Written by Peter Morgan known for Frost/Nixon in 2008 and The Last King of Scotland in 2006. Morgan puts on the big screen, a story about the challenges of two formula one drivers and their race to be the Champion of the World. The movie covers the 1976 season of racing that is known as one of the most intense seasons raced by two formula one drivers. The movie starts off in a Formula three race in 1970 where our rivals meet for the first time. After just a few minutes Morgan already painted a picture for us as to what the two racers will partake in. As we progress through the movie we learn a sense of who James Hunt and Niki Lauda are through their lives on and off the track. The playboy Hunt engages himself in the many affairs of woman, parties and paraphernalia, where Lauda is yet the simple man enjoying himself and remaining focused on the races ahead. Rush is narrated through each character really giving the feeling of growing a personal relationship with the racers and how they felt day in and day out.Rush makes you feel as if you are right there in the pit with the racers and their team. The fast passed scenery captures you and immerses you into the movie, experiencing what the characters are feeling and the emotions that come with each scene. The casting was wonderfully done, Chris Hemsworth plays James Hunt illustrating and capturing the essence of the playboy philanthropist and the many struggles he goes through fighting the adrenaline junkie within. Daniel Bruhl playing Niki Lauda the business man that means to win, but not at the cost of his life. Quickly we learn the differences between the characters off the track but as soon as they are engaged on the track we know it is all business from there.This movie does a fantastic of keeping the viewer engaged in the material. The director and cinematographer did an eye capturing depiction of what it would be like to be a racer in the 70's. The simple details of the logos on the cars to the color of the film bring this whole movie to life. If you're looking for some heart pounding intense scenes with a side of humor and lust with love this movie is for you. Don't sit at home and watch it, go out and see it on the big screen!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film, directed by Oscar-winning director Ron Howard, focuses on the intense rivalry between 1970s Formula 1 drivers James Hunt and Niki Lauda, particularly the 1976 Formula 1 season that saw both men push themselves to unthinkable lengths as they fought for the championship.But this film is not simply about a rivalry between two drivers. It is about determination, persistence, and the will to win?-it's about just how far some men are willing to push themselves in pursuit of victory and respect.Chris Hemsworth (Thor, The Avengers) plays British party-boy driver James Hunt. Cocky, arrogant, and known just as much--if not more--for his off the track exploits as his ability to drive a race car. If you were to write a book about Hunt's life it would be titled, Beer, Babes, and Breakneck Speed.The opening scene of the movie is an exceptional portrayal of Hunt. He walks into a hospital wearing his fire suit and sporting a bloody nose and black eye that he sustained not from a crash, but from a scuffle with another driver--supposedly because Hunt had slept with the other man's wife. In true James Hunt fashion, he wastes no time hitting on the nurse who comes to his aid. Hemsworth plays the role with ease. His pretty-boy looks and swagger make him believable as the party?boy, ladies' man who hasn't a care in the world.Niki Lauda and James Hunt are on complete opposite ends of the social spectrum. A consummate student of his craft, Lauda cannot be concerned with parties or nightlife of any kind. Lauda is driven by one thing: being the best. Daniel Brühl (Inglorious Bastards) plays alongside Hemsworth beautifully. Lauda's character can be best summed up in a scene where he makes his first test-run as a member of the Ferrari racing team. He finishes his test run and promptly calls the car a "shitbox" and says that he doesn't understand how in Ferrari's facilities they built such a piece of crap.Like Hunt, Lauda is arrogant, but in a way different. Lauda doesn't think he was the best driver. He knows he is. He doesn't think he can set up his car the best, he knows he could and he isn't afraid to tell you. Brühl's accent and delivery capture Lauda's personality with precision. The 1976 Formula 1 season is all about Lauda vs. Hunt. The two battle every race--with Lauda capturing early season dominance. A controversial disqualification because of an illegal car vacates Hunt's first win of the season. In the following weeks, he experiences a slew of blown engines as his mechanics struggle to reconfigure the car.Then, at the Grand Prix in Germany, Lauda fights to have the race canceled due to weather, but Hunt uses his vast popularity to sway the other drivers to vote to continue the race as planned. In this race, Lauda has a crash that left him trapped in a burning car for several minutes, severely burning his face and lungs. As Lauda recovers in the hospital, Hunt charges up the leader board, closing the gap between himself and Lauda. Despite opposition from doctors and his wife--and still wearing bandages from the burns on his head--Lauda returns for the final weeks of the season.Everything in the movie leads up to a Hunt vs. Lauda showdown in the final race of the season, which takes place in a torrential downpour that forces every driver on the track to ask the question, "Is this race worth my life?" This race that pushes both Lauda and Hunt further than they have ever pushed themselves, and it pushes one of them past his breaking point. A beautiful and tragic film all at the same time, Rush is a winner. The camera work is excellent. The racing sequences are exciting. But the story and portrayal of these two bitter rivals is the real selling point. Hemsworth and Brühl play their roles brilliantly and make this film worth multiple views.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>deep character story underneath a fast paced thrill ride</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Firstly, I'll just say I'm not a huge F1 guy. I very rarely watch it and when I do it's solely because there is nothing better on. I had only heard of Niki Lauda in passing without paying that much attention to it but this film really blew me away.The film centres around the two rivals Niki Lauda and James Hunt through the 1970s as they both became famous and known for their intense rivalry for the world championship. This is not usually my type of film, I like suspense thrillers usually involving crime or mystery of some kind. However, the story in this is done so well and you can't help but become engrossed in the lives of the characters. I like the fact that no one is really painted as a bad guy in this film but I couldn't help siding with Lauda throughout most of the film, whereas a friend who saw it with me came down firmly on Hunt's side. I think praise must be given to the developers for this as they ensure that the viewer is always able to empathise with one of the two lead characters be it the fun loving playboy James Hunt or the calculating professional Niki Lauda. This ensures interest is sustained throughout.The other characters are pretty much left on the sidelines but I never really noticed as the film is solely about the lives of Lauda and Hunt and how they influence each other. I do think the film ended rather abruptly but it certainly prompted me to research around the film a little and any film that can make me want to know more after it has finished must be good in my book.The directing from Ron Howard was fast and exciting it really helped to create a tense atmosphere during the race scenes but unfortunately made some of the slower scenes feel a little rushed.Overall, it's hard for me to point out from a cold critical perspective what it is about the film which makes it so good, especially seeing as I have no real interest in the subject matter. However, Rush was a really good film and I enjoyed it from start to finish. I recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good rivalry with fantastic characters which drive the story. You don't have to be a fan of racing as the race scenes only really seek to build up the tension and tend not to get technical. So sit back and enjoy the Rush you'll get from watching this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great intense drama. 7/10</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Review: This movie was made extremely well by Ron Howard and the actors done a great job portraying the rivalry between Lauda and Hunt. The only problem that I found with the movie was that none of there personal stories were seen through. Hunt seemed to jump from one girl to the other and Lauda seemed to keep his personal life secret so there true personalities came out when they were racing. The scenes on the track were very realistic and they brought some intensity to the movie. I also liked the fact that you actually see the real drivers at the end of the movie. Anyway, this movie is definitely worth a watch if your a racing fan or if your into your intense dramas. Enjoyable!Round-Up: Chris Hemsworth played Hunt really well and he suited the cocky character very well. After all his fame from being Thor and the Huntsman, you can actually see him being like that in real life. Daniel Bruhl brought intensity to his role which made the rivalry realistic and great to watch. The only problem that I personally found with the film was the fact that I'm not really into racing so I didn't know that much about the characters. Of course, I have heard about them before, but I never knew anything about there careers. This is were Ron Howard done well by entertaining fans of racing and people who are not into that particular sport. Budget: $38million Worldwide Gross: $90millionI recommend this movie to people who are into there racing movies about the rivalry between Lauda and Hunt. 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I think about who this film would target for its audience I think of males who like watching Formula 1. But I am a girl who now and then watched F1 with her dad and isn't amazingly interested in it and know very little of the history of F1. I never knew who Lauda and Hunt were. Yet here I find myself, blown away and feeling this is one of the best films of the year. This film was so exciting to watch, it was if you were there in the crowd, in the driving seat, in the pits. The pace was incredible and perfectly timed. The cinematography was beautiful, enhancing the thrill of the race. In the Japanese race I literally was holding my breath till the end, it was like watching the race live, incredible feeling watching it. Editing was fantastic, directing was fantastic. Whole thing was fantastic. Acting wise, for me, Hemsworth's best film to date. He was fantastic in this. He captured, what appeared to me as a conflicted driver who was like a horse chomping at the bit, ready to fly forward at tremendous speeds. In films such as Thor he is restricted, Thor doesn't really express much emotion, much personality (love Thor 1&amp;2 btw, not criticising the film or Thor as a character). But as James Hunt he came into his own, a masterpiece of acting. In regards to Bruhl, phenomenal too. Brilliantly captured Lauda's reserved personality, the way he's strict with himself and his limits, but hold his passion for the race and the car. Together they managed to make the bond between the two racers exciting and you felt like you were there with them, feeling their emotions towards one another. Especially when Lauda came back from hospital. One thing I think they could have done with this film is added a bit more original footage, especially in the racing scenes. Would have been fantastic to have seen some of it integrated with the crisp film work. I did like the ending, seeing the original film, but more would have been very welcome.Last point, WHY THE HELL HAS THIS NOT BEEN NOMINATED FOR AN Oscar, MORE GOLDEN GLOBES AND MORE AWARDS?! This is a damn fantastic film which I feel has been very underrated in its coverage. Plan to see this? Then what are you waiting for, it's bloody amazing.</fullReview>

Especially Daniel Brühl(Niki Lauda) and Chris Hemsworth(James Hunt) acting very well. And this movie based on a true story. After I watched film,I looked on internet about Niki Lauda's life. I found that. he is respected person, he had a lot of championships and he is a beautiful wife; when we turn to movie we can see all of them so that's very successful adaption. To sum up movie was wonderful for every age. It deserve nine points from me. And also we have to celebrate Ron Howard ,Peter Morgan and everyone who contributed to the make this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This based upon a true storyWe go back to the 1970s and see an intense rivalry between two Formula One (F1) racers: James Hunt (Chris Hemsworth) and Niki Lauda (Daniel Bruhl). Hunt is an aggressive driver likes the spotlight, is a womanizer, and puts his life on the line in every race. Lauda is the more conservative driver, calculating, plays the percentages, shuns the spotlight. Rivalries. We like them and if two that we like are at the top of the profession we want them to be friends. Were Hunt and Lauda friends? Jack and Arnie are friends, Roy and Gene were friends, and Chrissy and Martina are friends. Connors and McEnroe respect each other but are not friends?.. yet. In this movie we don't know who to root for. We tend to side with Hunt, until we see Lauda and Marlene (Alexandra Maria Lara) picked up on the highway by extreme fans of Lauda. These scenes are pure gold. Now we like Hunt and Lauda equally. See?This movie centers on the 1976 race for the Formula 1 Championship. Hunt wins, Lauda wins and Lauda has the edge in points. In the final race,in Japan under severe rainy conditions, for the Championship Lauda retires (this word is used when a driver leaves the race for reasons under his control) from the race and it is up to Hunt to come in at least in 3rd place to claim the championship from Lauda who is ahead on points. Will he do it?The acting and dialogues are spot on and one would think that Hunt and Lauda disliked each other, but we see glimpses of friendship too. Their views on how to race are like night and day and neither one will change. The racing shots are fantastic with superb editing and heart-pounding music. This is a very exciting racing movie and you cannot take your eyes away. However, this is also a study in personalities and who will win out? Hunt? Lauda? Anyone? No one?I am not a fan of F1 racing, but I am a fan of movies that show F1 racing like this one. Kudos to Director, Ron Howard, who did a fantastic and amazing job. And, now the answer: yes, Hunt and Lauda were friends, not real close but each wanted something the other had. In their early racing years they roomed together for about a year (Hey, I looked it up on Wikipedia). After Hunt dies at age 45 of a heart attack, Lauda says at the end of the movie that Hunt was the only one he envied. Lauda currently works for Mercedes AMG Petronas F1 Team.Both James Hunt and Niki Lauda are in the F1 Hall of Fame (I looked that up too). (9/10)Violence: Yes. Sex: Yes mostly in the beginning. Nudity: Yes, briefly in the beginning. Language: Yes, at times.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rush by far the greatest movie of 2013!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Recently getting into Formula One back in 2010, I found the historical aspect of F1 back in the 1970's. Before this movie I had no idea what happened and I had no knowledge of James Hunt or Niki Lauda. After this movie I couldn't wait for it to come out on iTunes so I could watch it all the time. I have watched it 6 times since I got it last week and I recommend this movie to the fullest. Greatest movie of 2013, Ron Howard did amazing.SPOILER (Summary):So it starts off with Niki Lauda (Bruhl), waiting in his car for the start of the German Grand Prix in 1976. He then flashbacks six years when he and James Hunt (Hemsworth) first met and their rivalry started back in Formula 3. Lauda bought his way into F1 with a bank loan and Hunt worked his way in by racing in the lower series longer. In 1976, Hunt signed for McLaren after Emerson Fittipaldi left the team. Hunt stated that the number one thing on his list of priorities was to beat Niki Lauda. The first 5 races of the 1976 saw the two battle on and off. At Spain, Hunt wins the race but Lauda gets his team, Ferrari, to make a claim that Hunt's car was illegal. The officials looked at it and deemed it illegal and was disqualified. The McLaren team began to adjust the car but it turned out to be "a big, stinking turd" in Hunt's own words.The penalty that led to Hunt begin disqualified in Spain was overturned after a series of appeals by the McLaren team. Leading back into the 1976 German Grand Prix, Lauda thought the weather at the circuit was too dangerous to drive at and called a drivers meeting to petition the race, but in the end, he and the drivers decided to race. After one lap on the rain tires, a majority of the field made pit stops to change on to the option tires. Lauda falling behind tried to make up time on Hunt who was far ahead. While pushing his car to the limit, his car broke part of his suspension and crashed into the barrier, resulting in near fatal injuries.After recovering from his injuries, he would lead the points going into the final race in Japan. Again, the rain was torrential, but this time Lauda retired after the second lap and handed the title to Hunt.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hope from Ron Howard</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I begin this post with a vow: I will not, no matter how tempting, make a pun based on the title of Rush. To my surprise, even creative writers such as Bill Simmons employed such a method. But I will not. I will rise above the appetizing pun. Last weekend I saw the film Rush. Let me tell you, it was a rush. (Sorry).I took the bait. Like many other movie-lovers, I had been waiting for Rush to come out for quite some time. It was directed by Ron Howard, and considering his last two films were less than subpar, it had to be good; he was past due. Beyond that, the trailer was a mess. A good mess. As I have shared before, Blake and I have a theory: ambiguous movie trailers produce great films. Of course there are always exceptions but I believe there are a lot of good examples. The next film I believe will fit this bill is The Counselor. Watch the trailer. You probably have no idea what the movie is about but I reckon it'll be pretty darn good. I felt similarly about Rush. I knew it was about racing and philandering, but not much else.Rush had a rudimentary story; there was nothing too complex about it. In many circumstances that would be considering a shortcoming, but excellent acting and precise storytelling made the basic plot impressive. As with most racing movies (Days of Thunder, Talladega Nights), this film was about a rivalry and a traumatic accident.James Hunt (Chris Hemsworth) is a handsome English free-spirit who enjoys his booze and women. Willing to risk his life, he often makes moves on the track others would not dream of, progressing him through the ranks of professional racing. Then there is Niki Lauda (Daniel Bruhl). Lauda is a calculating, cold individual who views racing as a mathematical equation. Despite the threat of losing the right to the family fortune, Lauda becomes a racer. Hunt and Lauda first meet in Formula 3 racing, two steps below Formula 1. Their personalities clash. Hunt pulls a risky move, winning him the race and knocking Lauda out. Lauda develops animosity.Despite his initial failure in Formula 3, Lauda takes out a personal loan and buys his way into Formula 1. Lauda excels and Hunt eventually follows suit. Their rivalry ripens in Formula 1 until Lauda gets in a fiery wreck. Because of tumultuous weather conditions, Lauda wanted to cancel the race. However, Hunt swayed the other drivers to vote to race despite the less-than-ideal weather conditions. Throughout Lauda's recovery, Hunt gains formidable ground in the standings while developing an admiration for Niki. Ultimately the season comes down to the last race. Hunt is still three points behind Lauda, but can secure a World Championship with a top 3 finish so long as Niki receives zero. Battle wounds and all, Lauda participates in the final race while another torrential downpour ensues. After a couple laps, however, Niki pulls into the pit and decides he is finished; the film suggests it was for the love of his wife. In dramatic fashion, Hunt finishes third and secures the World Championship. Months later Hunt and Lauda run into each other at an airport. Hunt tells Niki that he has no reason to race anymore since he has reached the top, but Lauda implores Hunt to stay in racing. The rest of the film includes informational text over actual photographs of James Hunt and Niki Lauda. If you want some actual historical context, look here.One may hear this tale and decide that it wasn't very original and/ or compelling. Normally I would agree with that sentiment. I am all for fresh perspectives and stories that have not been told before. Yet, no matter how much Rush reminded me of other tales, it was compelling. Many racing movies appeal to a certain type of moviegoer; the Transformers 2 super-fan-type. They are a special breed, not in it for the story line or the character development, but for the explosions and over-the-top sixty-minute ultimate battle scenes. They are the type of people that prefer the episodes I, II, and III of Star Wars (just despicable if you ask me). Rush, amazingly, was able to be a movie both for the aforementioned individuals and those with a more sophisticated palate. (Wow, I hope I don't sound too much like a snob). Ron Howard did an amazing thing: he took a very basic story and created a fascinating drama intertwined with titillating race sequences. He made an old story appear crisp. Obviously this was not without some help. Another reason you should definitely check out Rush is because of the acting. I had seen Chris Hemsworth in a few roles before Rush but none of which hinted that he was capable of the performance he displayed. On more than one occasion, I thought that this could be a breakthrough role for the young actor. It is not as promising when you look at what films are on deck for him, however. He has the second Thor movie, The Avengers: Age of Ultron, and Snow White and the Huntsman 2. Don't get me wrong, Thor and The Avengers were decent movies; they're just not roles that generate acclaim for being a great actor. There is always the chance he will break from his current mold soon, though. Rush was a taste of that. Alongside Hemsworth was Daniel Brühl.Overall, Rush was a fun film. It masterfully balanced many different aspects of cinema in one production. It was a great example of how to execute storytelling. I would definitely see this again, though I would want to make sure I had a large screen television and surround sound. 9/10</fullReview>

Even though I'm not a sports guy, stories about professional rivalries are just plain interesting and this one tells a great tale about James Hunt and Niki Lauda from the 1976 Formula 1 racing season. Watching this two men annoy each other onto greatness and have a mutual respect for one another was interesting enough for me but watching the truly epic performances from Chris Hemsworth and Daniel Brühl only made the film that much more interest-grabbing. And one can NOT overlook the stellar visuals from Ron Howard or how exciting the racing sequences are. Overall, I was just really taken back by how incredible the film was.</fullReview>

Sex, Drugs, Alcohol and Rock'n Roll. I love the way they have done all the scenes, I love the way those engines sound, heck this movie is brilliant. Chris Hemsworth has a nice role in this one. I like when I remember an actor from a role he played (ex. Thor) does something the opposite, something that you wouldn't expect at first. He acts like he lived through the seventies, he acts perfectly.On the other hand this other guy Daniel Brühl managed to act as the complete opposite of Chris.If this crew ever decides to make another F1 title, I'll wait eagerly to watch it.

		<fullReview>This film recounts the story of the rivalry between two formula one drivers in the 1970's."Rush" is aptly titled as it is a film about speed, and the necessity to obtain glory in the shortest time. However, "Rush" is more than a film about racing. While it does have a lot of scenes devoted to high speed driving in various racetracks around the world, it also spends a lot of time developing the characters. James Hunt and Niki Lauda are shown as real human beings, not just empty vessels for high speed chases. The rivalry drives them forward, and they have tremendous respect for each other. I detect an unspoken bond of brotherhood between them, even though they appear to be sworn enemies. This kind of relationship is not easy to forge, and also difficult to portray.The medical scene is disturbing, and I spent those few minutes covering parts of the screen. That is the turning point where the film gets and maintains to be emotional. Altogether, "Rush" is an entertaining and emotional film. It is a highly captivating film about breaking your own limits, and how much risk you will take to obtain what you want.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ron Howard deserves a lot of praise for portraying the rivalry between two Formula 1 drivers as more than just a battle of speed on the race track.It clearly has to be much more than that. And it is. It is a battle of wits, a conflict of psychology, a juxtaposition of philosophies and a contradiction of professional ethics.Chris Hemsworth, who himself has done a good job portraying James Hunt, may be the poster boy for the movie, but the movie undoubtedly belongs to Daniel Brühl. A stunning performance that deserves a standing applause, Brühl's portrayal of the eccentric sociopath, Niki Lauda is just outstanding. Never once, not in one scene, can you catch a glimpse of him falling out of character. It is an impeccable performance that definitely deserves a consideration at the Academy Awards.A must watch movie from 2013. A delightful saga of a legendary rivalry.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>In the same league as Amadeus</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ron Howard could be one of the most unappreciated directors in Hollywood. Year after year decade after decade he just keeps churning out quality. Although much more subtle and restrained than for example Cinderella Man (two adjectives you never thought you would see in a review of a racing film) this production is never less than hypnotic and viewer interest never wanes, not for a single frame. And a great story too -- some 30 years after the incredible Amadeus we have yet another rivalry for the history books. Hemsworth actually gets to speak entire sentences when he is away from Asguard, and, who knew, he is a very competent actor. Daniel Brühl is superb, especially considering his character is repeatedly described in the script as looking like a rat, and Bruhl has to compensate with raw unfiltered self-esteem, and pulls it off. Olivia Wilde is a treasure here -- it's not just the hair and makeup, it's like someone took her aside and told her that, unless she could find her inner Candice Bergin, her career playing tart after tart might just be over. For her first few scenes, she is almost unrecognizable, and she manages that feat by sheer force of will. Ironically, considering the theme, the finish is a tad weaker than the opening. Overall, however, a wonderfully entertaining film, timeless and memorable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Rush (2013)This is one tricky film. Simple on the outside, labyrinthine on the inside! There's a lot of brains, talent and money put into this thing. I don't want to dissect and scrutinize the film as much as I want to point out the key factors that made it the special film that it is. 1- Cinematography: Anthony Dod Mantle's cinematography did not prove effective with Danny Boyle's Trance (2013). However, the academy award winning cinematographer ''nailed it'' with this one. There's a lot to say about it:a) Camera Angles: Anthony Dod Mantle went nuts on camera angles. He put a camera in the drivers' helmets for cryin' out loud. Dod Mantle shot the film with ten different cameras but this time, he knew exactly why. The POV shots were overused but they were so stunning that I couldn't care less how overused they were.b) Slow-Motion: Dod Mantle made very good use of his state-of-the-art Phantom Flex cameras. The slow-motion effect was ''used but not abused''. It certainly added a ton of drama to the film's visual narration and it was all in the right places. c) Color Correction: The film has a retro blockbuster look with a greenish tint. It went very well with the story in terms of events as well as historical context. 2- Score: Hans Zimmer did an excellent job with the film's soundtrack. This comes as no surprise from someone of this caliber. 3- Story: Despite the fact that it's a biographical film, this is a story worth telling and I can't imagine the same story being told in a better way. The sad thing is that the film flopped at the US Box Office and failed to return half of its $40 million production budget (a reasonable number considering the high level of sophistication in terms of CGI and the big names working on the film).I loved it! 7.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the words of Nikki Lauda,"One can learn more from his enemy than a fool does from his friends".Ron Howard's epic F1 saga between Niki Lauda and James Hunt is perhaps the best period-rivalry-sporting movie of all time. Needless to say the director's work precedes him (A Beautiful Mind, Davinci Code, Apollo 13). This work will definitely be counted in his scale on the positive side.Chris Hemsworth's mean swing from Thor continues as the playboy-loose cannon James Hunt who finds himself the perfect foe in the always perfect-self centered-high on himself Nikki Lauda (Daniel Bruhl).The lead pair brings out all sorts of emotions, from the adrenaline pumping race to the heart melting hospital episode to the power of recovery. Everything has been scripted and played to the point of perfection. Bruhl's accent deserves special appreciation.With a script that rolls both on and off the track exploring the love life which is affected by the rivalry on the race, this is definitely a front-runner for the Oscars next year.A must watch for all petrol Heads.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent Portrayal Of A Sports War.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>EPIC, yep, that's the word for it. Very few movies have blown me away, fewer have left a mark on me, 'Rush' is one of them. It is undeniably one of the best among movies exhibiting a rivalry. I had very high expectations from this one because of the audiences going nuts about it. It was the most talked about movie after it got released and it didn't disappoint. The movie fulfills all the requisites required to make a movie of such caliber, to be precise: stupefying direction, fabulous screenplay, appreciable acting skills and eloquent quotes. The action sequences seemed real and were breathtaking.The cast satisfies thoroughly. Chris Hemsworth, as James Hunt, totally got fit into the character i.e of a crazy car racer. Daniel Brühl, as Niki Lauda, the serious guy, was expressive and pleasing, possibly the best performance for the role of Niki Lauda. Olivia Wilde as Suzy Miller and Alexandra Maria Lara as Marlene Lauda, in supporting roles were above average. Other supporting roles played by Pierfrancesco Favino and Christian McKay were mediocre. The minor cast too pulled out a moderate performance. Ron Howard's direction was first-rate, absolutely exceptional. Not even a single scene shot is unimpressive. I wish the movie had a little longer run time, revealing more about the rivalry. The screenplay by Peter Morgan was phenomenal. Music by Hans Zimmer was just incomparable. He is certainly second to none, and gets better by age. Editing and cinematography departments too were taken care of amazingly. Long story short, the movie is spectacular and beyond any doubt, one of the best biopics ever witnessed. It puts on view the passion, the dedication, the desire to be the best and only the best and probably every other necessity. Spend 2 hours watching this and you will know why it is getting all the hype.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Ron Howard film in the last 20 years</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Man, that was a good movie! Heard some good reviews and wanted to see it, but I prepared myself to be disappointed.I didn't like any of Ron Howard's films which came after "Backdraft (1991)", but this movie shows he's still go it.Technical aspect is excellent: Score (didn't realize it was Hans Zimmer until I looked it up just now), editing, cinematography, sound editing and I assume there is a lot of seamless CGI. And makeup.All of the above really give energy to the races and put the viewer inside the race. Great job. I loved the rough cinematography and editing - it gave the movie a documentary-like feel.Daniel Bruhl is excellent in his role and gives one of the better performances I've seen this year. I just noticed that he's nominated for a Golden Globe - he deserves that. Wait, he's nominated in "supporting role"? wtf?Chris Hemsworth is basically playing himself, but he's a good casting choice and fits the role very well.Don't get me wrong: A #149 place on IMDb is ridiculous and 2013 was a very weak year at the cinema, but this movie gets my vote on the list of the "Best Movies of 2013".I'm surprised to see that it did so poorly at the cinema: $90m worldwide on a $38m budget. I was certain it made much more.7/10 Highly recommended</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Rush' is the story about the rivalry of British James Hunt(Chris Hemsworth) and Austrian Niki Lauda(Daniel Brühl) in formula one.This film manages to show that rivalry from both sides and incredibly leaves you unable to choose who you would rather come out on top. That is one thing - among others - that this film does remarkably well. You become truly invested in these characters and their ambitions and their rivalry.Chris hemsworth gave an incredible performance and managed to break free off his role as Thor in this movie. Making me really believe he was James Hunt. However, Daniel Brühl really stole the show here with, in my opinion, an Oscar worthy performance. He got into the frame of mind of this real person and blew me away with his performance.Another note to add is that I'm not a formula 1 fan at all. You don't need to be to watch this film because the rivalry may be in racing but that isn't whats important. Its the rivalry and the character development done so well by everyone taking part in this film.This film glued my eyes to the screen throughout and there really wasn't a dull second. This is master performance from Chris Hemsworth and especially from Daniel Brühl and i would highly recommend this film is you haven't already seen it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Rush-I am sure this is one of the most anticipated movie of the year for so many like me.Yes,I was expecting this movie when I heard about the movie plot.Now coming to the movie,this movie is about the legendary rival between the greats of F1 racing,Nikki Lauda,the Austrian and James Hunt,the English.Their rivalry was well celebrated by the medias of 70's.their rivalry was very special.This movie peeps into the actual relation between the great drivers ever produced in F1 racing due to their extremes in character.Both Lauda and James were from the top families in their respective countries.But both of them were not provided help by their families to realize their biggest dream-to be the world champion of the speed.So they came into the arena by their own terms..In terms of character,Lauda was professional,a sharp automobile engineer and a man who cared about personal relations.He always calculated what he was going to achieve through his deeds.He even said that he could afford a 20 % risk in terms of risk he could afford in racing circuits.He loved a woman and married her lately and always wanted to be her.In short,Lauda made his decisions on behalf of his brains.But James Hunt on the other side was extremely different.He was a playboy to describe him in short.He had women all over his life.He enjoyed his life.He enjoyed his success and was desperate in his loses.He always cared for him.thus,even his married life was a nightmare.James Hunt was a man who followed his heart rather than brains.Their rivalry started during their F3 circuit when a dangerous move from Hunt made Lauda be on the losing side.This continued to the F1 circuit where Lauda became the world champion in the first year.this made James Hunt angry and decided to win the next season.But that season was followed up by winnings for Lauda at start.Can James Hunt bounce back and realize his dream?Sorry.this is not the rest of the story.The story is much more deep than we think.Rather than their rivalry they had a strong bond between them which was known only to them.They might be enemies.But they couldn't afford anyone between them.Thus it was a celebrated rivalry that medias brought to us.But the movie speaks more of their personal relations.Even when one had a bad time,the other felt bad on that and they tried to compliment each other in their own way.There was no much element of surprise in this movie if we watch the movie after reading what had happened.But the way the actors enacted it,it was amazing at least for me.Now with the crew,with Chris Hemsworth (Thor) as James Hunt and Daniel Bruhl (Goodbye Lenin) as Nikki Lauda,the characters were in right hands.Nothing to speak about the ace director Ron Howard(A beautiful Mind,Cinderella man,Da Vinci Code etc) to be the captain of the ship with Hans Zimmer's music was the anchorman.The crew was amazing .This movie didn't give me a single minute of boredom while watching.Watch the movie full.Hope many of you like it.Since,this movie was up to my hopes,I rate it as a 9/10!!more reviews www.movieholicviews.blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Made Me Enjoy Racing!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had kind of ignored the previews for this since racing is a sport I have never really been able to get into, despite my wife's odd obsession with NASCAR. I have watched a few Indy-Car races, but it never quite hooked me. Well I can say that even though I might not just find racing my cup of tea yet still, this movie was amazing. The story is compelling, the characters are played out extremely well, and the effects were amazing. The story is a real one, and touched my lil' heartstrings to the point that I researched it after watching the movie. The movie held true on all major points to the actual events of 1976. That in itself is different that most "true" movies. The characters were immediately hooking my attention as the arsehole of a racer against the man-ho of another clashed on the track. The effects of the races were quite nice, especially the key wreck in which the burn took place. If you compare the actual footage to that of the film it is hauntingly similar. Overall 8/10 and I will be buying on DVD/BluRay.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gotta admit, I didn't hold much hope for this movie, I'm not into racing or cars that much really, and the whole idea of the film seemed like just another cash in on an old sporting tale.....but how wrong I was. Rush is just that, a rush, and it's all the way from the start to the finish (line). That two hour running time goes by in a blink of an eye and it's never boring or padded out with any long winded drama moments. I truly enjoyed it.The movie was a little different in terms of story than I expected, because the promotional posters all have the Hunt character displayed prominently on them so I naturally assumed it was a tale mainly about him. This wasn't the case however, as I would say the film is actually more about Lauda than James Hunt. Both men are shown warts and all, and neither is put forward to be seen as better than the other. A fine feat really, and very well directed to deliver this position. I would certainly watch this movie again, and the film finishes leaving the viewer respecting both men for their achievements but with a tinge of sadness for James Hunt who seemed to burn out like a flare way too early in his life. Yes Rush is a rush indeed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing review of heroism and thriving as a human</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was a truly surprising film which ended up one of the best ones of the decade. The film greatly juxtaposes 2 different views of heroism and keeps the viewer guessing which main character has it right only to leave the final decision open to interpretation. The viewer is left to think about his preferences and life goals and the results of the decisions leading to those endpoints. There are very few movies that actually accomplish this kind of depth and self-reflecting. On the surface you have truly great cinematography about automotive sports in their glory days when tobacco advertising was permitted and athletes were relatable. This movie is a true gem and it's rating suffers only because it's set in non- relatable non-American setting.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't even like Formula 1 and I thought that this was the best movie of 2013, at least of the films I have seen thus far. The two principal actors deserve whatever awards they give out for a profession hardly in need of giving out awards (actors are already rich and famous beyond most people's wildest dreams so why would they need to get prizes?).The story follows two F1 drivers in the 1976 season, something I remember as F1 was much more popular in the USA back then than it is now. I certainly remember Lauda's horrible accident. The film does a good job of telling the story while developing the two characters through a few memorable scenes. I especially liked the scene where Lauda is picked up hitchhiking.This is just great filmmaking from start to finish.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rush (2013): A Film Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Every sport has its memorable rivalries. Boxing has Ali vs. Frazier. Baseball has New York vs. Boston. And in the world of Formula 1 racing, for at least one year, there was James Hunt vs. Niki Lauda, and that is the story told in Ron Howard's Rush. And I got to tell you, I loved every bit of it.The last Ron Howard film that I actually liked was 2005's Cinderella Man, which is also a sports film. In Rush, Howard takes a well-crafted script from Peter Morgan (The Queen, Frost/Nixon) and makes a film that is more like a shot of pure adrenaline.The film takes back to the early 70's when the hard-partying, aggressive driving Brit James Hunt (Chris Hemsworth) and the calculating, somewhat arrogant Austrian Niki Lauda (Daniel Brühl). Hunt is what race car drivers were stereotyped as back then. He sleeps with all the hot girls, he drives with a left foot, and he looks more like a rock star than a driver. Lauda was a perfectionist who viewed racing as a business and preferred working on his car in the garage over smooth talking business people at parties.As the film progresses, we learn about Hunt and Lauda separately. They rarely share screen time and when they do, they make it clear that they don't like each other. But they have similar backgrounds. They both came from money, their respective fathers wanted them to go into the family business, but they decided not to and worked their ways up to the big time. Hunt will stop at nothing to win, literally. I don't think he knows where the brake is. Lauda, on the other hand is aware of the dangers of the sport. He knows that every time he's out on the track, there is a 20% chance he won't make it.Hemsworth shows us that he can do more on screen than just throw a hammer around as his performance here as Hunt is great. He looks and sounds like the late, great racer. And Brühl's work as Lauda is nothing short of brilliant. They're nomination worthy pieces of acting that I consider two of the best performances of the year.Aside from the lead performances, there are a few worthy supporting performances of note. Olivia Wilde, in all her beauty, does great work as Suzy Miller, the British model who married hunt after the 1975 season, only to leave him a few months later for Richard Burton. Alexandra Maria Lara is terrific as Lauda's wife, Marlene. And Christian McKay, one of my favorite character actors working today, does fabulous work as Lord Alexander Hesketh; the owner of Hunt's first racing team who I wish had more screen time, because he doesn't show up at all in the entire second half of the film.Howard proves once again that he can make good movies after the disaster that was The Dilemma, but, despite the great performances, Rush, like the people it is about, is absolutely gorgeous. The cinematography from Anthony Dod Mantle (Slumdog Millionaire) and the great Hans Zimmer's score form a deadly combination, the engines of the F1 cars sound incredible, and the hair and makeup people deserve recognition as well.Rush was one of the most exciting movie going experiences I've ever had. Terrific performances, pitch perfect direction, outstanding music selection (even Gimme Some Lovin'), and everything else come together to make this movie a memorable one. This is one of the best sports movies I've ever seen, and I've seen a lot of them. See Rush, you'll be glad you did.FILM GRADE: A</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Rush' is a movie that has been on my watch-list for sometime. I was going to see it when it was released in theaters, but couldn't, which was a bummer. However, when I did get round to it, it made for one hell of a picture. I purposely didn't read up about the actual events that happened, because I wanted to go in without expectations. Well, I read an article on it in GQ, but that was a while ago, so whatever. I think it helped. This really is a brilliant movie. The way it's all done was pretty much flawless. The intensity of the racing and drama really made you feel invested, as did the brilliant performances by all the cast. Hemsworth and Bruhl portray such a dynamic yet intriguing relationship, that when it comes to the races, you just can't decide who you want to win, but you want to see where this rivalry goes. It was good to see Stephen Mangan take a prominent supporting role, too. I've only see him in 'Episodes' and follow him on Twitter, so I hope the other stuff he's done is like this. The style and direction also make this film so impressive. There are times when the camera literally doesn't stop moving, whether it be during a race scene or straight-forward dialogue scene, and you don't even notice it. It like you're on a constant ride. There are films where directors choose unconventional shots just to add diversity or for the sake of it, but not this one. Howard knew what he was doing. Kudos to you, man. If I'm honest, it didn't blow my socks off, but I just can't flaw it. As far as biopics and dramas go, this is one of 2013's finest.</fullReview>

If you looking for a movie with "soul" and "passion" this is the one you have been looking for. This movie is not just about racing , it is as much about life itself and carries on great weight about decision we make during our lifetime. Some of those might have big weight on our future.

		<shortDescription>History comes alive</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rush is a very well-made film about F1 racing that is not to be missed for any F1 fans and also highly recommended for everyone.The film is based on a true story of the rivalry between James Hunt (Chris Hemsworth) and Niki Lauda (Daniel Bruehl) and the famous near-fatal accident in 1976. It accurately depicts F1 racing in those days which was packed with thrills. Not just focusing on the race battle, it also captures the characters' details and presents their different ways of thinking interestingly.Daniel Bruehl is always my favorite, and this time he has done a great job playing Niki Lauda. The way he speaks (with accent), the way he acts, really resembles that Lauda I'd seen on German TV. He portrays the character really well that I hope he will get nominated for Oscar in Best Supporting Actor.Other than Bruehl, the film is also awesome in sound and cinematography. I loved the engine revving sound as well as the way they made the film in the 70's look, just like we were watching the real racing scenes.At the end of the exciting racing scenes, the film shows us how the friendship comes out of the rivalry. How they have a true respect for each other, although they were battling to death in races. Fortunately, F1 safety nowadays has improved tremendously from that time, and Senna remains the last driver to die in race.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are some movies that just deserves a big screen viewing, and Rush is one of them. I think Ron Howard is a master in his craft and has put together a thrill ride. It was loud and flashy and fast. Just like all car racing movies should be. He has directed some great movies like a Beautiful Mind, Da Vinci Code and Angels and Demons, the Missing, Cinderella Man and one of my top 10 movies of all time Apollo 13. Great story with great acting to back it up, especially the 2 leads. Chris Hemsworth in my eyes is shaping up to be a fine actor. He deserves to go far. I still remember him as Kim from Summer Bay and then as George Kirk in Star Trek.Loved, loved, loved the camera work. Flipping around showing multiple shots of the inner workings of the car and an inside look from the driver's seat and what's ahead of them. Great use of slow motion sequences and a terrific sound track. Some cool songs from the 70s. The intense rivalry and gradual feelings of respect these two men had for each other was entertaining to watch with each race building up to a satisfying conclusion. Of course I had heard of Niki Lauders near fatal accident and I knew how it all turned out, but I didn't care. It was just that much fun to watch.I will defiantly give this movie multiple viewings over the years. And will absolutely recommend this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I must say, I am not that average man who likes cars, racing and stuff. I always tend to drive carefully, follow the rules and keep the speed limit. But this movie.. it arouses something in me. A feeling from the childhood, when boys are watching these crazy cowboy sci-fi action movies and dream to become racers, astronauts, policemen and firefighters when they grow up. This is not a movie about some race. This is a movie about people. About sportsmanship and respecting your contestant. About the fair play, the challenge, the fun of it all and about taking the risks. 'Rush' is thrilling from the very beginning to its very end and I was enjoying every second of this movie.

		<fullReview>"Men love women. But more than that, men love Cars".Hear, Hear! Absolutely! Studies say men think about sex every 3 minutes. Hmm, but no doubts about the 2 minute gap. That's reserved for machines. Curves of metal, humming engines and the adrenaline. This week at the movies, Ron Howard's 'Rush' pays tribute to the Man- Machine relationship and it doesn't get more intimate than this.Rush is inspired by real life rivalry between Formula 1 racers James Hunt (Hemsworth) and Niki Lauda (Daniel Bruhl). Them ruled the tracks in the 70's and it was their riff that kept them ahead. The film boasts of well written and performed characters. Hunt is a partying brat, a womanizer who believes in enjoying the life to the fullest. Niki Lauda on the other hand is a complete contrast. He's disciplined, knows his tech inside out and being the son of a businessman, knows the economics of the trade. One's a British and the other a German, even the accents are different. The only thing common between the two is the passion to drive, and unconditional love towards their machines.Its a simple story of these drivers trying to beat each other with their rivalry acting as the main catalyst. Look out for their interesting verbal conflicts for lighter moments.Now for the hero of the film. Cinematographer Anthony Dodd Mantle takes us to places where no one has ever been. Close ups of axle joints, acceleration pedals, exhausts of the engine breathing fire and screeching tires as the cars move at the speed of 170 mph are breathtaking. Especially the starting of the last race in Tokyo where the tracks are wet after rain, the first skid of the tires are shown in slow motion throwing water droplets away from its periphery. I mentioned intimacy, didn't I? All he does is use his experience of handling primitive digital cameras right from the days of Dogme95. Never has being seated in a cinema hall been so thrilling. Don't forget to put your seat belts on, you are in for a ride.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent portrayal of events, and a thrilling movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really enjoyed this film, and amazingly so did my (usually pessimistic when it comes to movies) girlfriend.Despite only just being born when the real life events of this movie took place, I've been a huge Formula 1 fan for many years now and have watched and read up on the 1976 season. And with that in mind I feel that with this movie Ron Howard has done a great job portraying as much of the real-life events as possible while keeping within the confines of Hollywood movie-making (and the inevitable box-office considerations).Both Hemsworth, and especially Brühl, turn in fine performances as Hunt and Lauda respectively, and I feel both men truly captured the essence of the two drivers as well as the rivalry and respect they both held. That said I'm not exactly sure why Hemsworth is the only one shown on the promotional posters as Brühl is arguably the more important (and certainly better acted) character of the two. Requirements of pretty-boy marketing I guess.The effects in this movie are all first rate and truly add to the spectacle without overpowering it. The fateful and horrendous Lauda crash at the Nürburgring is particularly well executed.One thing worth noting is that you don't need to be steeped in motorsport knowledge to enjoy this film as the emphasis is definitely on character and relationships, rather than fast cars. As I said at the top, my girlfriend who is no motorsport fanatic by any stretch of the imagination, loved this film as much as I did.Overall a really great film about an intense and interesting friendship/rivalry during one of the great eras of motorsport.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Before watching Rush i had never watched a Formula F-1 race in my life, but the film stilll impressed and got the heart racing at many scenes.An Outstanding film in all aspects!!!Ron Howard one best directors alive,impresses again with Rush, an excellent film.The Whole film was based on Niki Laude VS James Hunt.The films shows how James Hunt and Nikki Laude both struggled to get the top, to become #1, and how they strive for excellence made them rivals. Acting wise both leads gave amazing performances, them being Dainel Bruhl and Chris Hemsworth.A must watch for the amazing cinematic experience, and you don't wanna miss one best films of the year.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rush - The Machine Magic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>rush is being directed by Ron Howard who is not new to cinema world and been around here for a long time provided this masterpiece of facing to do anything for the fire of passion between two great minded equally talented and good hearted drivers, done by Chris and Daniel along with the lead ladies who gives their back up for the movie solidly.With widely sarcastic and anger growling through which starts with a mildly and ends up in more serious issues. A clear portrait of what men do when they are on chase with their passion.the lead characters are unique which leads to this intense ambiguity between them.technically the movie is strong with state of the art cinematography and heart thrusting musical score by Hans Zimmer whose implications was left deep by the true and lively story telling by Ron.the last few scenes where very intense and gripping as of the racing scenes especially the hangar scene which there is a small conversation between the two lead characters.Over all the movie is finest of 2013 and the movie will be remarked as a all time favorites in few decades.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Awesome Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I took Veterans Day off and my wife and I drove to Lubbock, TX to see this movie [100 miles from home], because it was not scheduled to be shown at the only theater we have here. I was stationed in Germany 8 years during my military career, stationed in the Eifel and Sembach, and got hooked on F1 racing and going to Spa, Nürburgring, Hockenheimring, and then the Le Mans Endurance race a couple years. I'm still hooked but have now added the sports car series, prototypes and a couple others - not roundy rounds.I was at the track when the Lauda crash occurred. The films coverage of this event following the crash were a little short but pretty close to what I recall.As soon as this comes out on DVD, I'll own a copy. I've seen all the greats, Le Mans, Driven, Grand Prix and numerous others. Ron Howard and his crew smashed this one out of the park. I can't recommend this great film highly enough.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Great movie its a piece of Art Good acting and the pace is very good Its not boring at any time. The sound is great as well. If you like racing you should see this movie, and if you don't like racing but like family values or emotions this is also the movie to see. You will enjoy this movie for every second. Both actors are creating a perfect picture to watch, its a pity that the movie has to end. It would be nice and easy to watch if they would continue for 1 or 2 hours, especially when you are a F1 Fan like me. I watched this movie in the cinema and the sound was crazy. The rating that this movie received is also very good, critics can not really spot a weak point in this movie, as i said this movie is really and really a piece of Art. I hope you enjoy!</fullReview>

I could have given this 10/10 but only movie I have given 10/10 on IMDb was INCEPTION and I cannot give any other movie 10/10 cause I just like dicaprio .. and I might change the rating of RUSH to 10/10 if dicaprio will win an Oscar later ... :P ALTHOUGH this movie has nothing to do with dicaprio .. :DTHIS MOVIE touched me so badly and in this phase of ma life when I am desperate to catch motivational and inspirational examples of the people who devote themselves wholeheartedly to their careers and then comes the result which gets imprinted on the face of the world ! HANS ZIMMER made this movie experience very emotional and I almost cried :P NOTHING BEST THAN THIS MOVIE I HAVE WATCHED IN LAST THREE YEARS AT LEAST .. and undoubtedly one the best and classic movies in my life and what more than that its based on a true story of two formula one legends one of which is still alive. Either HANS ZIMMER (for OST) or Daniel Bruhl (Niki Lauda)SHOULD win an Oscar at least .. THE MOVIE ITSELF DESERVES a huge applaud and if this movie is not winning any sort of Oscar then I might stop watching movies ... cause then I will confirm that is a great unbalance in Oscar nominations and winnings .. since dicaprio has not won any Oscar so far as well ... bulll shhiiitt :P and yeah if this movie is still running in cinemas near you you better watch it cause its only meant for cinema experience the effects and music .. THIS IS THE ONLY MOVIE I WONT DOWNLOAD and will probably buy a ORIGINAL BLU RAY print from market for the first time in my life cause this one deserves it ! thats another thing that most of the torrents are blocked in UK anyways :P</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best racing movie of all time?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ron Howard's Rush is by far the best auto racing movie I have ever seen. It really captures the feeling of what it feels like to be in the world of an auto racer. The previous auto racing movies like Days of Thunder, Talladega Nights and Driven just don't capture the feel of what it's really like to be a professional auto driver. Part of it is probably since it's based on a true story and not a fictional story with overally sappy or comedic moments that are totally unbelievable in comparison. The race scenes are very intense and totally captures your imagination.I like Chris Hemsworth in the Thor role but he was way more to sink into as an actor in this role. Daniel Bruhl is great also as the other lead character, both should get serious Academy Award consideration.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I entered Rush completely oblivious to F1, having only briefly researched the Hunt vs. Lauda rivalry a few hours before seeing it. And I must say that despite never having watched a F1 race, I found this movie extremely entertaining! After walking out of the cinema I immediately went and bought every F1 racing game I could and become obsessed with F1, researching drivers, cars and tracks, that is what this movie did to me. Bruhl and Hemsworth looked near identical to their real life counterparts and their mannerisms resemble the duo perfectly. Ron Howard rarely disappoints and this movie is no exception. Ron presents both of these larger than life men and gave them an equal playing field. You will undoubtedly find yourself rooting for one or the other throughout, supporting their every move, then somehow have your opinion switched. The race scenes are shot incredibly and deeply immerse you in the race to the point where you almost feel every turn, giving you a taste of the real danger racers put themselves in every time they put on the helmet.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ron Howard(A Beautiful Mind) provides us a movie which is so engaging in which you wouldn't think about who-is-winning rather what-next-is-going-to- happen? Rush is a movie where your heart starts pumping each and every second the participants start racing.You move your head left and right not because you are driving but the races are so engaging, you just cannot stop yourself to do that. James Hunt,a playboy who loses his contract to the sponsors after losing the WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP and then begs to MACLAREN(the only car which could beat Ferrari then) to give him a chance so that he could beat Niki Lauda. Niki Lauda who is more of a realistic kind of a guy is a businessman from Austria who has rejected to take forward his father's empire just because he only knew about F1 then and wanted to do something big.Yes, the world knows them (James Hunt and Niki Lauda) as biggest rivals but as Niki Lauda once says "He(James Hunt) was one of the few whom I liked. The only person I envied." This movie is not all about racing, It's about the life of two professionals who on the outside are opponents but deep down they care for each other. They respect each other.This is a movie where even if you are not a Formula One fan you'd love it because it has elements. Elements that make a movie thrilling,heart pumping and keeps you on the edge of your seat.Chris Hemsworth(Thor) steals the show as a playboy and a racer but its Daniel Bruhl(Inglorious Basterds) who is the real show stellar in Rush. It's his Austrian accent and I-know-everything-about-cars attitude which makes him pleasing to the eyes. He is just excellent in the sequences where he suffers in the hospital after his accident.Add to that Hans Zimmer(The Dark Knight,Inception,POTC) is there for the Background Score which just sets the mood exceptionally well and Anthony Dod Mantle(DoP) is also there without whom this movie wouldn't have made that impact as those camera angles and movemet did.RUSH which totally engaging and an edge-of-the-seat thriller. Rush to the nearest theater to watch this beauty.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Catch It While You Can</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Biographical sports drama Rush tracks the strictly competitive rivalry between Formula One racers James Hunt and Niki Lauda during the 1970s.Even before you've arrived at the starting line, there may be understandable scepticism on whether Rush is really a race you wish to run with. However, like Moneyball (2011) before it, I was pleasantly surprised at how investing a story about a sport I know nothing about and care nothing for could be. Cars are useless without people to drive them. Rush is a vehicle painted with a core theme of the professional and personal consequences of fierce rivalry, between it two primary passengers. Formula One racing is just the fuel to push the vehicle to its eventual destination.It is a story worth telling, both for those who were spectating during the 1970s, and for those like myself who are still taking driving lessons and didn't know the names Niki Lauda or James Hunt until this film existed. Behind Ron Howard's careful direction and sensitivity to the story, Rush invites its audience to witness the depth of competitiveness that Lauda and Hunt travelled through. Its expertly crafted pace, detail and tone complement the (f)actual events also, with Niki Lauda even expressing his positive reaction to the film's look and accuracy.Despite a 123 minute run, your legs feel motionless. Rush is a timeless tale in two senses: 1. Its great display of the triumphs and pitfalls that competitiveness can have are accessible and applicable throughout history, throughout the modern world, and probably will be throughout the future 2. The film is so engrossing that not once did I question how much time had passed nor how close we were to the end. Rush has enough continuous momentum to take us to the end of the journey without exhausting emissions, as we cruise through seamlessly to the finish lineWith its fantastic editing and storytelling techniques to push the story along without making it feel, dare I say...Rushed, Rush masterfully places its two protagonists in lanes so far apart that only their egos are able to fill the empty space. Like Batman and The Joker, Hunt and Lauda are represented as polar opposites whom were almost destined to become competitors, as it is only their mutual rivalry that fuels their motivation to win. Without one competing with such passion, the other wouldn't have the passion to compete at all.The story is only complemented further by the enthralling performances of Daniel Brühl (Lauda) and Chris Hemsworth (Hunt), in addition to Olivia Wilde's brief yet brilliant supporting role. Rush's arrival at the finish line is as smooth as the ride that Ron Howard takes us along throughout. Thrilling, investing, interesting and well-made flawlessness, is about all one could request of a biopic that centres around such sensitive source-material. Rush is exciting, frightening but most of all the right thing to catch up to in theatres as its release seems to be on its final laps around UK tracks, so rush to see it. Oh dear I wrote it again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rush: Bringing Formula 1 To Your Seat</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rush is such a pleasant surprise! I have never much cared about Ron Howard's intent and style as film director, yet admire his ability to zero into what sells now - whenever now is - in Movieland. His populist touch once made me thoroughly dislike A Beautiful Mind (2001), a film that has everything in it for me to love and was deluged with awards. Cryptography, mental illness and Russell Crowe as John Nash seemed a perfect match, but a tendency to ease the audience's experience by spelling out the future drove me away. That tendency still exists. In less subtle territories such as Apollo 13 (1995), Ron Howard really does himself justice. And in Rush where sports history serves as guide, kudos to him for straying from philosophical considerations and going for pulsating material, hand-held camera first.Formula 1, a compelling rivalry, 70's glamour and serious speed with Thor/Chris Hemsworth and Daniel Brühl at the wheels cannot fail. In principle, that's what Rush is. However, in the hands of Peter Morgan who wrote The Queen and the adapted screenplay for The Last King of Scotland, something incredible happens: the perfect Saturday date night movie scripted as if the author personally knew James Hunt and Niki Lauda when they put everything on the line in 1976.Rush is the closest most of us will ever come to driving a Formula 1 race-car. It excels at giving the audience a genuine sense of the speed such finely engineered machines generate and the relative lack of protection they offer. The polarity of James Hunt's gregarious rock 'n' roll persona played by a charismatic Chris Hemsworth with Brühl's technically brilliant but emotionally remote Niki Lauda, eventually feels more like a duality. Both these extreme athletes from before the X Games era may have had more in common than they probably ever acknowledged. In 2013, they are revisited by two actors who for disappearing into their respective roles could find themselves sharing centre stage with Ron Howard and Peter Morgan in March 2014. I would not be surprised for Julian Day's costume design to receive an Academy Award nomination too. Frida Giannini's period-evoking looks for Chris Hemsworth and Olivia Wilde (Suzy Miller) are so in tune to the glamour of the times they represent, they are desirable now. Rush is a beautiful movie to watch and Gucci can expect a stampede for several bespoke items. I wish product placement was always this subtle!Like the absorbing Senna (2010) by Asif Kapadia, Rush does not require in-depth Formula 1 knowledge. One is a meticulously crafted audiovisual memoir in documentary form and the other is a cool action flick for a cosy night spent in good company. The journey starts with Rush.</fullReview>

The two have a love and hate kind of thing going, that keeps there competitive going.Excellent film, that captures the look of the 70's perfectly. Director Ron Howard does it again, his direction is brilliant. Chris Hemsworth gives a good performance has James Hunt, and Daniel Bruhl as Nicki Lauda, showing there desire to race, and at times egos getting in the way. But both having the strong desire for greatness, I think that it was well captured on film.</fullReview>

The visual effects were dynamic and the color Palette was beautiful.

		<fullReview>Rush is living proof that sometimes the truth makes a much better story than fiction. Set in the 70s amongst the glamorous world of grand prix, Rush is so much more than a movie about car racing. It tells the story of the rivalry between Niki Luader(Daniel Bruhl) a disciplined and anti-social trust fund baby turned race car driver and James Hunt (Chrris Hemsworth) a charismatic and part- loving playboy. Their relationship is compelling viewer as they push each other forward to achieve their individual dreams at great personal sacrifice. Both Hemwsworth and Bruhl are outstanding in their individual roles. The footage and camera-work are compelling and the depiction of the 70s era will make you feel like you belong there. This is a movie that both men and women will enjoy (albeit for a very different reasons) and, despite the fact that I detest car racing, it will go down as one of my most favourite films of all time.</fullReview>

Also you can sense the decades from the vintage quality and colors. But most important you can feel the power of the cars as if you were right there on the race track and your heart literally stops a few times during the 120 minutes just to start beating fast again!! You'll end up understanding how this two amazing drivers gained each and everybody's respect and admiration both on each particular lifestyle!

		<fullReview>It was only yesterday that I went to see this film in the cinema, and with no regrets. I hadn't seen the trailer, I only knew that it was a film about F1 drivers, but I didn't know anything about the drivers or F1. From the first minutes of the film I was hooked. It's simply amazing.The director, Ron Howard, tells this story with a nonlinear narrative, which gives the audience (or at least me) more of an excitement for the characters, I wanted to know what caused the rivalry between these two men. The cinematography is superb in my opinion. The setting is magnificent, the cars, the locations. He does a great job representing the era, shows its ups and downs.As much as Ron Howard deserves a pat on the shoulder for the movie, the ones who made me feel sympathetic and excitement was the performance from the strong leading actors, Chris Hemsworth and Daniel Bruhl. Chris Hemsworth showed his impeccable talent and passion for acting, with the strong performance of James Hunt, nominations should be lining up for him. Daniel Bruhl also gave a strong performance of Niki Lauda, a unsociable rat (as said in the film). You don't have to be a great F1 fan to favor this film, as it isn't only a film about cars, but human nature, hatred, and love. The whole film is magnificent, the beginning, middle and ending. It's thrilling car scenes and magnificent directing and acting give the film such emotion and excitement that you feel as if only half an hour has past when the film finishes. A must watch film!!</fullReview>

The plot is engaging, the acting is excellent, the pace is riveting, the character development is strong, the editing and cinematography is exceptional and the mood captures the 70's nicely. Best of all its true, AND, shockingly, accurately portrayed. This is much more than a Formula 1 movie. It's a study in the rivalry of polar opposites, hyper competitiveness, 70's excess and winning above everything. There are few movies that have so many elements working well together. Sure there are a few reviewers who are self-described Formula 1 "aficionados" that lament the racing scenes. Not sure why; I found them riveting. But whatever. I'm more interested in Niki Lauda's views-"This story was very accurately depicted....I wish James Hunt could have seen Rush because he would have enjoyed it."A true story told....truly. What a concept. Enjoy the ride. It's intoxicating.</fullReview>

The film really captures the excitement of racing in the mid seventies with excellent cinematography, gutsy performances, relentlessly good music and sound, and perfect direction! Even the peripheral characters come through with fine acting - maybe that's a sign that everyone on board loved making the film. There are subtle things in the scenes that seem to go way beyond just watching fast and loud cars race around the Formula 1 tracks of the world. But you'll want to find them yourself, when you see the film. Big screen is highly recommended.Only problem with RUSH is that I now seem to driving a bit too fast on my way home from the supermarket. I guess I can thank Niki and James Hunt for that. Ron Howard &amp; co too.Stunningly good movie!</fullReview>

Rush is a really great, moving, and funny movie about a truly different time in Formula 1 history which is set apart by a truly brilliant performance by Brühl.Even with the tragic story Rush manages to also be funny at times, with funny one liners and hilarious scenes. Rush is not a racing movie but is still able to convey the feeling of Formula 1 and what it is about and what it means to its fans as good as the emotions and the personalities behind the characters, sugar coating nothing and showing them as real people not as characters in a movie.Brühl managed to transform into a second Niki Lauda, really getting the gestures and the voice and even the accent to match up with the real Niki Lauda.

		<fullReview>"Rush" (15) Director: Ron Howard Starring: Chris Hemsworth, Daniel Brühl, Olivia Wilde, Natalie Dormer and Alexandra Maria Lara. Running time: 123 minutes. Rated: 15, for containing strong language, sex and bloody injury detail. Out now in UK cinemas.Set during the 1976 Formula One season, "Rush" explores the rivalry between James Hunt (Chris Hemsworth) and Niki Lauda (Daniel Brühl) and the respect that they had for one another. Back in 2010, the Formula One film was re-born with "Senna", an interesting documentary which looked into the final years of Ayrton Senna's life. Received extraordinarily well by both fans and critics alike, "Senna" was considered to be the (by some people) best film about Formula One in cinema history. Three years later, Ron Howard ("The Da Vinci Code") decided to direct a film which would appeal to fans of Formula One and the general film fan. It is definite that he has succeeded. The film begins by telling the viewer the interesting stories behind each character. Hunt (Chris Hemsworth) always acting the playboy routine and Lauda (Brühl) being a straight laced man who goes to bed early and performs well. Entirely different people.The biopic genre of film is not unfamiliar territory for Ron Howard; as he has directed the powerful political drama "Frost/Nixon" which was a return to his biopic films.Both actors play their roles extremely well. Chris Hemsworth performs to a degree which we have never seen him before, adapting the playboy persona like a duck to water. However, it is Daniel Brühl who steals the show as Niki Lauda. Olivia Wilde delivers a solid performance as Hunt's wife, Suzy Miller, despite her clearly underwritten part. Alexandra Maria Lara portrays Lauda's wife in a larger role than Wilde's which gives her character time to flourish. The racing sequences are shot brilliantly. Cameras are placed everywhere on the cars, from gear sticks to the hood; Howard invites the viewer to really take a look into the world of Formula One from a completely different angle.As the film continues, we are swept along a dark road in which James Hunt takes, whereas Niki Lauda does not; and explores problems with the pair's relationships.The only problem that I had with "Rush" was that it never explored the undeniable respect which Hunt and Lauda had for each other. In footage of past races, Hunt and Lauda were always close and rarely shared bad words, but here they act like bombs just waiting to explode.VerdictDespite a minor blip, "Rush" performs just the way it should. Delivering great acting, fabulous set pieces and exhilarating racing, "Rush" runs ever so smoothly.9 stars out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rush Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Formula 1 racing is the World's top motor sport, its the pinnacle of all motor racing, its also the most dangerous. Ron Howard's new film Rush, scores on many levels and fails in a few. First problem is the marketing for the film. They give Chris Hemsworth's character all of the spot light on the billboards and posters, when Daniel Bruhl should be the one. There are a few advertisements with Bruhl on them, but he needs to be front and center, because he is the leading actor in this film and outshines the whole cast. Hemsworth is just a more marketable face. Nikki Lauda (Daniel Bruhl) and James Hunt (Chris Hemsworth) are two of the top Formula Three racers in the 1970s. The film Rush spans over six years and chronicles their rise to Formula 1 drivers and their infamous rivalry that fueled them.Chris Hemsworth is no doubt a talented actor. I wanted to hate on him just cause he is who he is, but I can't. Hemsworth's acting is most certainly something to admire, his egotistical confidence and cockiness is pitch perfect. He truly impressed me with every scene. Daniel Bruhl nails it with his performance. The directness and care that Bruhl takes in every hand and face movement is absolutely precise and a pleasure to watch. Bruhl is miraculous, so spectacular that he needs a nomination, I loved his character work.Ron Howard does a fine job at keeping the film vibrant and energetic while adding extremely dull environments, that make the beautiful bright colored textures pop out. Howard stylizes the race sequences expertly, he never really takes you out of the crash, a lot of tight close- ups on the drivers and car parts. Its also an excellent screenplay by Peter Morgan, I just felt there should have been something more to it. Rush is a very straightforward film, that doesn't push the boundaries, it definitely stays within the lines.Rush came close to being a fantastic film, don't get me wrong, I still throughly enjoyed the film and highly recommend it to anyone. There were just a few more (unknown) things I wanted out of it. I must see it again. I give Rush an 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For me this was my most anticipated movie of the year because of the vast amount of creative knowledge of the FULL cast. It did not disappoint.Firstly Ron Howard, what a lad, in this movie he has put together a masterpiece. He has a way of directing that at first you wonder if its the right way to do it but looking back at it you know he was the perfect man for the job.From the trailer you expect to know the whole plot before seeing the movie but the writers developed this movie in a way that you do not only get James hunts or just Niki luadas look on it, but both. It shows how two rivals need each other to push themselves, which keeps you interested throughout.Thor or sorry Chris hemsworth puts in his best performance yet portraying, from what i have heard, James hunt excellently. Arrogance, wittiness, respect and determination described this performance, making Chris my new favorite actor. Daniel Brul was excellent, no more be said. All in all, best movie of the year by far.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all, I have to accept that I am not an F1 fan. So I am completely ignorant about the history of this sports and the famous rivalries associated. What I liked about "Rush" was the movie can convey its subject to those who doesn't really need to be F1 fans. The film is about the famous rivalry between 2 F1 stars, James Hunt &amp; Nicki Lauda. Now more than their achievements on the track, it was about how their rivalry commenced and what may be the factors that led to the rivalry.Ron Howard is quite aware about the subject he was going to handle and the possibilities to become a stereotyped sports drama comprising of phoenix rise, great fall etc etc, if not handled smartly. As mentioned earlier, I have no idea about the rivalry so whatever I understood is what I got from the movie. Ron and writer Peter Morgan initial conveys their background (both hailing from wealthy families with different ambitions) and the cultural differences. Also we can see how their attitude towards their life results in their positives and negatives and how the outcome plays during some of the important points of their life. The common feature in both the characters is the extreme self confidence.A balancing act was well performed by Ron and his writer Peter and thus kept the audience away from an absolute clichéd sports drama. I will not claim that the movie was flawless but chances are rare for you to get disengaged from the experience due to boredom. This is the strength of the presentation by Ron Howard and it is simply terrific by the fact that its a real life rivalry. Also he didn't opt for a docu-fiction style and used possible cinematic liberties without affecting the realism of the subject. Now there is a particular scene where Hunt punches a journalist which I found a bit "filmy". I cannot confirm whether it happened in reality (since the character sketch of James make it possible) but currently I like to see it as one of the cinematic liberties. After all its based on an "incredible" real life story as credited. A major highlight of the movie along with the performances from the lead cast are the well choreographed pulsating F1 races especially the German Grand Prix &amp; Japanese Grand Prix. Some brilliant dialogues between James &amp; Nicki towards the end conveyed the rivalry with a silent mutual respect between them.I may not have seen many of Chri Hemworth's performances but from what I saw, I rate this as Chris's best performance till date. He literally lived as James Hunt. But the actor who got a more meatier character, more one-liners and overshadowed Chris at places was Daniel Brühl as Niki Lauda. Alexandra Maria Lara (as Marlene Knaus) portrayed the role of Nicki's supportive wife while Olivia Wilde portrayed Suzy Miller (James's wife).But the biggest highlight is the score of Hans Zimmer. I just have no words to describe that score and I am sure those who watched this experience will surely notice the score. Anthony Dod Mantle's used a color tone to suit 70s and he along with Daniel P. Hanley &amp; Mike Hill's editing delivered a terrific job with the race sequences. Just like the F1 races, the movie moves at a breakneck pace. The make up and costume department justified their presence by providing the 70s look to all the characters while the production designing team came up with a similar effort by providing us the feel of 70s.Overall, the movie was a terrific experience as if you are in an F1 race. This will surely engage you even if you are not an F1 fan or follower with its theme and the emotions associated with it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rush to see this on the big screen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie succeeds on many levels. As a movie about racing it's well photographed and exciting. As a story of the two racers James Hunt and Niki Lauda, Ron Howard's deliberate pace is just right here showing two different personalities both likable and human. In fact because both are so sympathetically portrayed I wanted both to win and it the races had as much meaning as the Ben Hur chariot race. There is a good balance of humor and drama. There may have been some liberties taken to play up the rivalry between the two but it's forgivable.The acting is top notch. Chris Hemsworth gives charisma and charm to the role and shows he can do much more than Thor. Daniel Bruhl of Inglorious uglies up and gives such a touching performance especially after the accident. Olivia Wilde has a brief but effective appearance as Suzy Hunt.Even if you aren't a Formula 1 fan it's still very watchable especially on the big screen. This movie deserves to be a bigger hit than it has been.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Story of Competition, Human Triumph, and the Racing Business</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My dad comes from a racing background, used to be a mechanic in the pits of sprint and Indy cars, and I grew up on a track. I have known the story of Niki Lauda through him. I saw this movie tonight with great expectations, most fulfilled.The story begins getting to know the two main characters and their vastly different lifestyles. James Hunt, the dashing, charming, handsome, exciting, womanizing, witty adrenaline junkie race car driver. Niki Lauda, average looking, very few people like him, intense personality, extremely logical, always afraid of complacency, comes from extreme family money in Vienna, Austria, is supremely intelligent - so much that he is a bit socially awkward, and told his family he wants none of their money and he'll make it on his own. Lauda gets a $2 million dollar bank loan, buys his way into a partnership with a broke car owner, mechanics report to Lauda per the contract and Lauda with the mechanics work round the clock to rebuild the race car. Then he knocks Hunt out of #1 spot, Hunt has no respect for him initially because he didn't pay his dues. The fierce competition begins.The movie takes you through the lives of these guys in one season of racing - as well as the business of car racing. Dealing with sponsors, owners, mechanics, watching fellow racers deaths and dramatic injuries, track officials, race tracks, weather, and the media. Then to the crash at the rainy race in Germany where Lauda was badly burned, including the inside of his lungs from breathing in 800 degree fuel induced fire. He was read his last rights by a priest, and somehow endured. Movie gives a glimpse into his treatments including vacuuming out the fluid from the burns in his lungs, not for the weak stomach. While he was going through skin graphing and these extremely painful treatments he is watching TV and Hunt creeping up to his first place spot. Motivated and hungry to win Lauda is back on the track about five weeks later still bandaged and healing. It's a media frenzy and no one is more glad to see him than Hunt, although disturbed by his face. They compete again with a mutual respect, a few races later in Japan the weather is rainy again. Due to media and viewers they decide not to cancel, risking the drivers. Lauda starts the race, he recognizes it as too dangerous and bows out, Hunt competes to take home world championship and needs to come in third or better to do it. Great ending and finish.Two things I felt this movie left out. First, why were these guys drawn to racing? Movie never established the attraction, tried but fell very short likely due to bad editing. Second, did not actually show cars passing each other and what the competition is really about - it is why these guys love it and anyone watching or involved in racing is drawn to it. Otherwise fantastic film and very under rated by critics. I highly recommend seeing this human story, a true story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Engrossing entertainment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>By focusing on the rivalry between James Hunt ("Thor's" Chris Hemsworth) and Nicki Lauda (Daniel Bruhl) and avoiding the familiar sports movie formula, "Rush" speeds past most 'underdog done good' sport films. Directed by Ron Howard, "Rush" documents the battle for Formula One supremacy between Englishman Hunt and Austrian Lauda during the early- to-mid seventies. This relationship is what makes the movie tick and something to be enjoyed by all movie buffs, not just F1 fans.While they share a passion for car racing, a desire to win and have big egos, Hunt and Lauda's conflict arises from their differences: Hunt is a tall, good-looking, outwardly confident playboy while Lauda is shorter, looks like a rat and more intense. Both men are intensely flawed ? Hunt battled alcohol issues and pre-race nerves, which drives him away from his first wife, model Susie Miller (Olivia Wilde). Lauda is serious, intense and disliked by other racers, mainly because he uses his family's wealth to buy his way into F1.Not surprisingly, Hemsworth and Bruhl dominate the film. Hemsworth plays on his sex-symbol image (with a number of sex scenes) and Bruhl gives an intense and determined performance. Quite a contrast from those who remember Bruhl from the light German comedy "Goodbye Lenin". Bruhl's performance is even better considering English is his second language and he speaks in a heavy ? but still understandable - accent throughout the film. While this is a serious film, the Hunt/Lauda rivalry is complemented with some black humour and back-and-forth insults.The film focuses on the 1976 F1 season, with some dramatic race scenes. While I'm not an F1 fan, the race scenes are engrossing and you feel like you're in the race with the drivers. The most dramatic part occurs when Lauda recovers from a horrific crash which saw his face badly burnt. Be warned, the hospital scenes are a bit gruesome. Luckily, we're spared a clichéd 'rise to redemption' fairytale finish like every other sports film.Even if you don't like sports films, "Rush" is well worth watching for the dynamic between Hemsworth and Bruhl.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rush is likely one of the top films of the year. No caution flags or pit stops are going to stop it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Along with being a film guy, the other passion in my life is sports and the credit for that has to go to my family. My dad played baseball throughout his youth and we have been Detroit Tigers season-ticket holders for years. My mother's family is a hockey family and my uncles and aunts have won numerous high school championships. My younger brother is a baseball and hockey player and I enjoy cheering him on during his games. One sport my mother and father were into before I was born was Indy Car Racing. Unfortunately that sport has declined in popularity and these cars no longer race at our local track, the Michigan International Speedway so I never had a chance to get into it.OK, so I went to see the movie Rush which is a movie from Ron Howard about Formula 1 Racing. Being a film person, I knew every actor in this movie but I knew absolutely nothing about the actual people depicted in this movie nor Formula 1 Racing which is a European and not an American thing. Frankly, this is a movie I should have not liked nor cared about at all.Rush is based off a true story and set in 1970's, about Formula 1 race car drivers James Hunt (Chris Hemsworth) and Niki Lauda (Daniel Bruhl). The movie tells the story of the fierce rivalry of these drivers who were opposites in just about every way and how they interacted with each other and eventually became friends.As he did in " The Cabin in the Woods", Hemsworth plays playboy, fun-lover James Hunt. Hunt is a partier who drinks heavily, is frequently hungover, takes drugs and has a new woman every night. He is still a very good driver who is very fun to watch and in the last act shows a high level of determination chasing the championship. Olivia Wilde plays Hunt's wife Suzy Miller though the movie does not allow any development of their relationship as they are married shortly after she is introduced in the movie.Where as Hunt is just thrown to you as a character and given no back story, Niki Lauda is depicted as a very in-depth character with a detailed history. Lauda is a character who's family has given up on him after choosing to be a race car driver instead of going into the family banking business. He is the exact opposite of James Hunt. Lauda is mean, anti-social, disagreeable and a "my way or the highway" type of guy. After throwing in the towel at a party, on his way home Lauda meets his wife Marlene Knaus (Alexandrea Maria Lara). The love and chemistry between these two is strong and the exact opposite of the empty marriage of Miller and Hunt. Lauda's character also endures a terrible fiery crash with extreme burns to his face and the movie does an excellent job with his makeup and the story of his very painful rehabilitation and return to the track.For someone who had no knowledge of Formula 1 Racing, this movie was a perfect introduction and a way to get into it. The movie also depicts the 1970's realistically with the men's long hair, fashion and drug use. Formula 1 Racing is shown through the various racetracks and the film show it's cultural impact and popularity in Europe. Rush includes strong cinematography showing high level racing and anybody would be entertained by this movie whether you are into automobile racing or not.When it's all said and done, Rush is a moving and powerful movie by director Ron Howard to add his already great resume. Howard makes us care about a story that most Americans don't even know about. Rush is likely one of the top films of the year. No caution flags or pit stops are going to stop it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not being a follower of Formula One, I was totally oblivious to what transpired in that universe in the 70s (or any other decade, for that matter). Happily and wisely, I chose not to be any wiser on this subject prior to watching "Rush". Otherwise, it would have seriously compromised my enjoyment of this superb fact-based movie. Not knowing how the suspense turned out was obviously the most important. But almost equally important was the fact that there could be one and only one ending ? the factual one. Put it in another way, regardless of whether a character survived or got kill in a crash (don't suppose it constitutes a spoiler to say that there are car crashes in a movie about Formula One racing), if this were fictional, I could always "disagree" with the way the story was written, or even go a step further to say: if I had written this, blah, blah, blah. The beauty of a biopic is that you can never quarrel with the ending and, ironically, it makes the suspense that much more exciting (assuming, of course, that you are in the fortunate position of not knowing what had happened when you walked into the cinema).Instead of plot twists, it's the character clash that keeps you glued to your seat. I confessed from the very start that I was not a Formula One fan. But I was fortunate enough to be a tennis fan during the same period, and entertained by a very similar personality clash, by two of the best in the field. Granted that Jimmy Connors was in no way whatsoever a womanizer such as James Hunt (Chris Hemsworth), there is a similarity in their flamboyant persona. And both were from the English speaking world, the U.S. and the U.K. respectively. At the other side of the court (or at the next lane, whichever you prefer), there are the ultra-cool, composed tacticians, Bjorn Borg and Niki Lauda, from Sweden and Austria respectively. I hasten to point out also the difference here, as Borg would never be caught raising his middle finger or flinging around the four-letter-word as Lauda so readily did. But still, in both cases, the fundamental similarity is prominent: fire vs ice, passion vs determination.Ron Howard demonstrates once again his directing versatility in offering this heart-pounding car race drama, something I don't believe he has done before. He did an excellent job in choosing his leads and in getting the scriptwriter, camera crew and everyone else to work together to create this first rate mainstream entertainment that is also intelligent. The classic conflict of two heroes who hate and admire each other all at the same time makes Howard's job a little easier. Just as an added bonus, as a little diversion from enjoying the excellent acting of the two leads, you can also try to decide which of their respective love interests is more attractive: Olivier Wilde or Alexandra Maria Lara. At the end of the day, that is really an "eye of the beholder" issue.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Who said Formula 1 can't be exciting?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The closer you are to death, the more alive you feel. It's a wonderful way to live. It's the only way to drive."Ron Howard is back on full gear after a couple of setbacks with The Dilemma and Angels and Demons. Rush is one of his best movies and he really does the title justice because you actually feel the rush of Formula 1 driving in this film. This is a great sports biopic that follows a lot of the well known sports clichés, but it works nonetheless thanks to a superb story and some great characters. The difference with the sports formula here is that there is no clear villain as both characters are strong rivals who despite their differences are still likable and sympathetic. They are very different in their approach to racing, but the film doesn't seem to take sides or try to tell us which driver we have to cheer for. Howard's film is intense and exhilarating, one you will enjoy even if you're not a Formula 1 fan. If you have never heard of the real life rivalry during the 70's between drivers Niki Lauda and James Hunt then you are in for a thrilling ride here because the story is really gripping and powerful. If you are familiar with the story it is still enjoyable because the racing scenes are gripping with some insane camera angles and some great editing while the two lead performances are strong. This is the second time that Academy Award nominated screenwriter, Peter Morgan, collaborates with Ron Howard after Frost/Nixon, and once again they succeed in delivering a powerful biopic. This isn't Morgan's first screenplay related to sports either as he also wrote the script for The Damned United, one of my favorite sport movies of all time. These two should continue to work together because Rush is exciting and thrilling regardless whether or not you like Formula 1 racing. Ron Howard takes us back to the 70's to relive the classic rivalry between two successful Formula 1 drivers: James Hunt (Chris Hemsworth) and Niki Lauda (Daniel Bruhl). Hunt is a British playboy who is passionate about driving and will do what it takes to win each race without considering the risks, while Lauda is a meticulous, extremely disciplined and calculating cold blooded Austrian driver. Despite their opposite personalities, they both have one thing in common: winning. Their rivalry began during the early 70's when they were both facing each other in lower divisions, and it escalated when they both reached Formula 1. The climatic moment takes place during the 1976 championship where a series of spectacular events unfold including a near fatal accident by Lauda and a nail biting season finish. The risks were high in this high speed sport where the safety conditions we have today didn't exist then. The film however doesn't just focus on their rivalry on the tracks, it also follows their personal lives off the track giving the characters more depth. We get a glimpse into Hunt's reckless marriage with Suzy Miller (Olivia Wilde), and Lauda's relationship with Marlene (Alexandra Maria Lara). The rivalry between these two men may just be the extra push they need to become better drivers, but it can also lead to taking more risks in a deadly sport. Rush was a pleasant surprise because it wasn't just another sport movie about two bitter rivals; it actually was a film about two rivals who brought the best out of each other and that is what made this biopic so much more interesting. It's that fierce competition between two talented drivers in a fast paced film that leaves you with a sense of rush and raises your pulse. Howard also does a great job at recreating the 70's and delivering some exciting racing scenes. Hemsworth proves he is more than muscles and Bruhl is just as exciting on screen. I wasn't surprised by Bruhl's performance because he had one small scene in Inglourious Basterds that really blew me away, but I really hadn't discovered this side of Chris Hemsworth who proved he has a career after Thor. Rush is such a dynamic and fun viewing experience, one you won't want to miss. The difference between these two lead characters and the way they play off each other is what ultimately drives this film to succeed. I can't think of any other racing movie that worked better than Rush, and I still haven't mentioned how exciting that final race scene played out in the rain with the slow-motion camera. It was breathtaking, give Rush a chance.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The best sports movies are the ones in which sports is the glue for insights into human attitudes, relationships and the spirit.Rush does very well on this count. Plus, the romanticizing of Formula 1 and the the rivalry between the methodical and the flamboyant is very entertaining.The director manages to get under the skin of the real life characters.The script builds the characters so well that you like both of them.Some great acting and witty dialogs add to the fun.Keeps you on the edge with some racy music too. For me, the movie checks many boxes.Very relatable to non F1- enthusiasts too.It transports you to the F1 season of '76 and stays with you after it's over.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not very keen on Formula 1, so the news of a biopic about the rivalry between Niki Lauda and James Hunt didn't strike a nerve. When the trailer for the movie appeared, I was even less eager to watch the actual movie since the trailer wasn't particularly good. Eventually, I did see Rush in a full theater on a Saturday night, and absolutely no one in the audience talked throughout the movie. It seemed that everyone, myself included, was amazed by the movie and enthralled by the story. Rush turned out for me to be one of this year's biggest surprise and, for now, one of the best movies of the year.Rush follows two very different Formula 1 drivers. One is the charming British partyboy/playboy James Hunt (Chris Hemsworth), and the other is the determined Austrian perfectionist Niki Lauda (Daniel Brühl). As the voice over ? from Lauda's point of view ? early in the movie says, he's most famously known for two things ? the first being his rivalry with James Hunt and the second being his nearly fatal accident in which his face got severely burned. The movie gives us a little backstory about those men, about their backgrounds, personas and family life, and then spends the remaining time depicting the events that happened in the 1976 Formula 1 season.The best thing about Rush is that it doesn't have any major flaws ? it's just a very good movie, as simple as that. Rush is a two men show: Chris Hemsworth and Daniel Brühl make this movie, no other actors or characters other than them are really important to the story. The casting of Hemsworth and Brühl in their respective roles was genius, not only because they look like their real life counterparts, but they feel very natural in their roles and portray their characters with ease. Of course, one may argue that their roles weren't extremely difficult to play, but they do it so believably and smoothly that I think at least one of them may get an Academy Award nomination ? if not even both of them. I do hope that this movie introduces Brühl to the mainstream audience some more, since he is a talented actor and it would be great to see him in more mainstream movies.As for the plot of the movie movie itself, I was somewhat suspicious ? can a rivalry between two sports figures be fascinating enough for a two-hour-long movie? Fortunately, I was once again taken by surprise. The story depicted in the movie was rather dramatic, inspiring and engaging ? it was intriguing to watch two completely different men approach the same dangerous topic (or should I say problem?) of formula racing. So, yes, there is more than enough drama to fill the length of a two-hour movie. Interestingly, the only thing that's lacking in this sport biopic are the scenes of actual sport ? there aren't much racing scenes. Those scenes are used selectively and to push drama forward, never to replace the actual drama. And when they were in the movie, you could see they were magnificently shot, with the just right amount of shaky cam. I would expect nothing less than technical perfection from an experienced director like Ron Howard. The soundtrack in the movie was also good ? most of it was composed by the great Hans Zimmer. All in all, Rush is a truly excellent movie about an entertaining story and it features brilliant people who know how to do their job.</fullReview>

Because I didn't really feel Hemsworth's playboy-ness convincing enough. "He's like a good church-boy going all Don Juan," said my husband. And I agreed.Apart of that, I also don't really like the ending, where Lauda summarised the epic life story of Hunt ended up simply by him enjoying the life.Anyway, I like the way the 2 main casts presented their characters.

		<fullReview>What a fine film this is. It is fantastic that such a great film can be made for such a small budget. If there's any justice, this film should triumph at the Oscars, and pick up more attendance/DVD revenue as a result.The movie looks like it cost far more to make than ~$40 million.I think Ron Howard made a master stroke in choosing the 70s F1 era to set his film, and picking the '76 Hunt v Lauda season as the main focus. The race scenes are so brilliantly done. Fantastic camera angles, in car shots, helmet cam shots etc. that really bring home what monstrous and dangerous beasts those 70's F1 cars were to drive. There's a touch of very well done CGI to make the vintage track scenes super realistic. The Nurburgring and Fuji rounds are brilliantly done.An appreciative shout out to all the owners of the vintage 70s F1 cars, who allowed them to be used in the making of this film.But it's not just about the cars and racing, it's also the very human story of two ultra rivals who disliked each other intensely, but needed each other to draw the best from themselves. Set during a time when F1 had more characters, or certainly a time when characters were ALLOWED to show their character!! But perhaps the most compelling human aspect to the story is just how the F1 drivers coped with the extreme danger, literally risking their bodies or lives to win. Lauda rationalized it, Hunt embraced it.Hunt and Lauda were a few years before I started to follow F1, so I can't comment to the absolute accuracy of the screenplay, but I'd guess it's pretty damn close. I do remember Hunt as a commentator with Murray Walker on the BBC though! Anyway, the acting performances all round are superb. Bravo. The costumes are awesome, who says the 70's weren't cool? I walked away from the cinema awestruck!! Some more like this please Ron Howard!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Based on the true story of one F1's greatest rivalries - between thrill-seeking British playboy James Hunt and the fiercely dedicated Austrian perfectionist Niki Lauda - Ron Howard's latest is, as the title suggests, a cinematic adrenaline rush. We get a quick and dirty intro into both drivers before we're thrown headfirst into their respective F1 careers, and specifically, the 1976 season that saw their on-track feud boil down to the final event in Japan, where heavy rain and treacherous road conditions provided a dangerous finale. Howard barely stops for a breath in the two hours of Rush; whether it's the edge-of-your-seat races or the turbulent personal lives of our competitive duo on screen, the movie never stalls or bores. One of Hollywood's newest A-list members, Chris Hemsworth, proves he can do more than hunky action roles with a wonderful and surprisingly subtle portrayal of Hunt, however it is, without a shadow of a doubt, Bruhl who really impresses. The underrated German actor imbues his Lauda with multiple layers and a slippery charisma in a spectacular performance that, with any justice, will garner him attention come awards season. Anthony Dod Mantle's cinematography and Hans Zimmer's score are expectedly first-rate, however a special mention must go out to the sound design team who have constructed a thundering and immersive aural experience that positions you squarely in the high-risk, high-octane environment whilst sending vibrations through your chest and getting your heart pumping at a million miles an hour. Don't steer away if you know nothing of the subject, this movie is accessible to anybody who loves their sporting biopics or great motion pictures in general.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ron Howard's Baby That Isn't Quite Perfect</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ron Howard's vision of Rush is an undeniably effective directing job. He puts everything he has in his project and it shows, but Rush isn't a perfect. No matter how beautifully artistic the film was pieced together, I failed to be completely enthralled until Act 3. In fact, I had a different experience with the film in each act. Rush never found a common ground of consistency, even if it's well organized. When the picture started, I was thrown back in my seat by the radical editing and the thundering sound, making some of the year's biggest technical achievements that don't come from Sandra Bullock in space. The film proceeded as I expected a typical sports film would, so no matter excited I got from the brilliance of Howard's directing or the compact editing, I didn't connect or care about to the story. In Act 2, the cinematography popped out at my face and made me recognize the beauty Howard captured on film with the picture. But, I remained untouched and unpropelled by Rush as plot threads began to pile. Give Rush time and it will pay off. Finally Act 3 became the stunning winner that took everything to the next level. The story finally locks you in to caring about the two leading men. This is the time when they finally become humanized and all the themes of the film hit me like Hemsworth's race car would hit anything in his way to glory. The script lets you dissolve into the personal feelings of the characters at this point and Rush becomes a great film.Daniel Bruhl's powers jealousy, determination, and levels tragedy into his role, forming a performance that stands three dimensionally apart from the rest of the cast. The make-up is frigid and ravishing and is another asset to the art in Rush. I have problems with the final scene as it is covered in unnecessary sentiment. It's purpose is to repeat everything we learned for two hours and smile about it instead of letting Rush have a potent conclusion, cutting with the scene before. Rating: 7.5Rating: B+</fullReview>

I've not seen this kind of star power since Clooney. His work here is almost a shock whereas Daniel Bruhl as the Niki Lauda -- Hunt's deadly serious rival --gives the breakout performance of the year.I am not a racing fan at all but I love action. Ron Howard &amp; his amazing team put you inside a Formula 1 race car as effectively as Alphonse Cuaron &amp; company put you in space in "Gravity". The race scenes are far &amp; away the best ever put on film &amp; that's only half the movie.The scenes off the race track are as equally effective due to the contrasts between Lauda &amp; Hunt. Peter Morgan's screenplay gives you a deep understanding of these two rivals. They're intense competitors who have a grudging respect for each other despite their polar opposite personalities. I liked each of them for entirely different reasons. Hemsworth &amp; Bruhl do a great job at capturing their charms &amp; quirks.The cinematography is gorgeous throughout. The editing never lets up while never beating you up.Ron Howard has done great work in the past. This rates alongside "Apollo 13", "Cinderella Man" &amp; "Frost/Nixon" as my favorite films of his. Rush" is a rush.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What An Intense, Brilliant Movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am positive that this film will be nominated for Picture of the Year and Ron Howard Director of the Year. Absolutely can't miss! Daniel Bruhl as Niki Lauda and Chris Hemsworth as James Hunt, racing rivals in the '70s were both phenomenal. In most pictures, with two leading characters, there will usually be one everyone likes and one they don't. Not in this film. Both are captivating and likable. Amazing talent in this picture. Even those viewers not totally into auto racing will enjoy this one because in addition to spectacular racing history and scenes, this one has a great story. I've got to admit there were a few agonizing moments where I was unable to watch, but I wouldn't have been able to tear myself away from this movie until the end for anything. This one is a winner!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Amazing movie!! It is far from the usual and it is different. Now people tend to celebrate everything thats "different" which i do not! But "Rush" just sucked me in. I have to admit, i am not even a huge F1 Fan and it doesn't matter at all, weather you like motor sport or not! Rush doesn't divide good and evil like many other, Niki and James both are very different and are unique in their own way!On the negative side you could bring up that historically not everything happened like in the movie, but over all it is still a Action/Drama movie and not a Documentary! Go watch it 10/10 from my side : ) !</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Audiences love to watch two sports people at the top of their game battling out man to man, do or die on the sports field or track. If the two combatants have gone past friendly rivalry to mortal enemies or each representing the others nemesis, then so much the better for TV ratings.Formula 1 (F1) in 1976, when do or die could be taken quite literally. Driver safety was a low priority, cars were raw, everyone was learning and there was still room for a hard drinking, eccentric, drug dabbling, womanising, playboy with talent to make his mark.Enter stage left, James Hunt (Chris Hemsworth) with an upper class English accent, skill to burn and a complete distaste for playing by the rules, working hard and respecting any form of authority.Contrast this larger than life character with Niki Lauda (Daniel Bruhl), an Austrian with an abrupt manner, almost no diplomatic skills and personifying everything Hunt was not.The two rivals fight small time battles in Formula 3 before Lauda buys his way into the fledgling "March" team as the second driver. Promptly overseeing the rebuild of his car, Lauda's real skill lay in setting up the car to be faster and better before he even started the race.Meanwhile Hunt eventually stumbles into F1 under the "Hesketh" team, all champagne and aristocratic privilege, completely at odds with the more corporate F1 scene.The pair race and the trackside enmity starts to build as the drivers jockey for position on and off the track, they eventually move to their respective premier race teams of Ferrari (Lauda) and McLaren (Hunt). The two drivers acting as polar opposites in their approach to their chosen vocation, lifestyles and attitudes.As most viewers with a passing interest in Motorsport will know, there is a serious accident followed by an astonishing recovery and then a climactic 1976 world champion clinching race in Japan.Director Ron Howard is a highly professional film maker and it shows here, the film is as meticulously tooled as the cars on display. The period setting is excellent, the on track speed is arguably the most exciting race footage ever shown. The sound and sensation of raw power waiting to be unleashed, the use of close ups and engine components, all add to perception of speed and nerve tingling raw danger. Tyres shimmying and scrabbling for grip on the tarmac on the start grid, drivers desperate to win or die trying.The film is helped by a solid turn from Hemsworth, clearly having a blast portraying someone doing just that, having the time of his life. Bruhl gets the more difficult role and nails a portrayal that could have been unsympathetic in the wrong hands. The actor managing to find and show the intrinsic humanity and professionalism that lay below a rough, uncompromising exterior.Hunt died in 1993 aged only 45 of a heart attack, ending a colourful, eccentric and unconventional life. In retrospect a world away from the current professional, in bed early, hit the gym and then eat well sportsmen and women, who tend to dominate the professional sports world. Out of place then and probably unemployable if transplanted to 2013.There is little to fault here, however the female characters do not get much to do. Olivia Wilde as James Hunt's "on a whim" first wife Suzy Miller, married apparently to settle him down. That's a fail right there. Miller is all big hats and tantrums, presumably not realising that marrying a womanizing, hard drinking F1 driver might have some ups and downs. Alexandra Maria Lara as Marlene Lauda, gets to look worried, long suffering and downcast but with not much else to work with.Overall as good as it gets, taking great subject matter, adding some touching scenes, state of the art (but not seen) effects and teasing out some great performances, what more could you want.Summary Accessible, sexy, dangerous and with lashings of 1970's glamour, there is much to enjoy with solid acting and superb racing sequences anyone can enjoy.Excellent, go watch it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly good!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I flip flopped quite a lot on this film. When I first saw the trailer, I thought it looked like another cookie cutter Hollywood film, particularly because of Chris Hemsworth. Then I read up on the backstory about the great rivalry between Lauda and Hunt, which actually created some anticipation. I went into the theater expecting it to be a modern classic after reading the reviews, but within the first ten minutes I was aware of its flaws.A slightly insipid music score by go-to-guy Hans Zimmer, a seemingly unnecessary voice over that holds the viewer's hand throughout the opening, and a rather rushed beginning. The computer effects for the recreated stadiums and the car races were below par as well. I didn't even get a good 1970s vibe from the atmosphere of the piece. The period seemed glossed over with some by the numbers pop songs to demonstrate different ups and downs in the character's lives. James Hunt is struggling with his celebrity status, so let's play "Fame" by David Bowie, seems like a good match! The whole experience appeared to be very vanilla, as is usual with Ron Howard. But I hung in there, and by the second half of the film, it had improved dramatically. Daniel Bruhl's performance as Nikki Lauda was extraordinary. He captured perfectly the raw determination, the slightly misanthropic nature of the Austrian rival. He was a bastard, but relatable, and his emergence as the protagonist made me concentrate more on their relationship, which was really the crux on the film, than my petty remarks about the cinematography or score. Besides, the sound design was top notch. While I absolutely detest montages that were used to artificially speed up time after each competition, the races did improve so that by the end, the tension had reached exponential levels. The tragedy suffered by the characters gave insight into the nature of sport and what makes the daring feats and psyche of these men so alluring.The performances of Chris Hemsworth and Bruhl, and their likeness to the respective people, were extraordinary. The exploration of their personal lives added verisimilitude to the story as well.Rush is a good film, and while it isn't the best in the past 10 years like some are saying, nor is it Ron Howard's most accomplished work (that honour still belongs to 'Apollo 13' or even 'The Missing') it's certainly one of the better releases this year and a sure fire Oscar contender.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is not just for Formula 1 fans. Ron Howard did an amazing job making sure there was just enough Formula 1 racing, sights and sounds mixed with fantastic cinematography and a storyline to keep everyone entertained. The action, the drama, the plot, the whole thing was well put together. This is a must see movie. Daniel Bruhl was an almost exact match of Niki Lauda. So exact, it was scary. And of course there Chris Hemsworth playing the flamboyant James Hunt. Well casted. I've been waiting for this movie to premier for almost two years. It was worth the wait. Can't wait to go see it again this Friday and will definitely buy it on Blu Ray.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Character drama+F1 racing=A Very Good Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ron Howard's movies can be a hit or miss. They are either really good or not very memorable. Nonetheless, he is a director that will try anything. That reason alone makes him very versatile. Each of his movies looks and feels different than the other. His new film Rush is set during the 1970s?about the Formula One racers. Its center focus is the rivalry between Englishman James Hunt (Chris Hemsworth) and Austrian Nicki Lauda (Daniel Brühl). What could have been a bland sports action flick is an interesting and thorough character study of two men after glory. Both share the same goal of winning the championship yet they are both polar opposites on their outlooks in the game.James Hunt is depicted as a charismatic playboy type. He sleeps around with women, drinks, parties, and lives purely for the moment. Lauda on the other hand is an individual who sets himself to be the best. He takes his driving so seriously that he spends all nighters perfecting his race car, not even bothering to associate with his fellow acquaintances. One cannot help but wonder if he is an "a--hole" as most characters call him, or if he is just treating racing as an occupation. Hunt displays a persona that is easy to like and admire?he is a bit of a showman and likes to have fun. Lauda is the opposite. He could care less about his looks or images and he is hardly ever seen elated. Seeing these two completely different personalities marks great character drama that gives the audience a purpose to watch the film?unlike Days of Thunder, which was only fun because of the races and crash sequences. While the movie is well written by the great Peter Morgan, the soul rests on Hemsworth's and Brühl's performances. Hemsworth scores his best work as James Hunt. It is nice to see him break away from being Thor and doing something that requires a bit more depth. Perhaps this can be a shift away from the superhero schtik. Spanish actor Daniel Brühl had more of a challenge to develop with his character. One of which is the fact that he had to portray an Austrian racer. Though bilingual, his Austrian accent feels fake and overdone. That does not necessarily mean he is terrible. Acting wise, he is very good. He truly shines following the crash that almost leaves his character dead. He marvelously pulls off a touching scene in which he tries to fit a helmet over his head, but he can't due to the pain. Both the physical and emotional agony he endears of fearing he may never be able to drive again is borderline heart wrenching to watch. Many people are talking Oscar buzz for him and he might very well earn a nomination. The other factor that cannot be overlooked is the technical marvels that Ron Howard and his crew put together?the fact that cameras were mounted on real F1's going 180 miles per hour is incredible. The type of camera angles and techniques are fascinating. We get to visually experience what it is like to be on a fast ride. As director of photography, Anthony Dod Mantle truly went all out on this picture. The sound design is equally top-notched, some of the best I have ever heard in a movie theater. The editing is crisp, appropriately building the plot's tension. The visual effects are sparse but effective during the crash sequences. Hans Zimmer's score is low-key for the drama and adrenaline pumping for the races?a fitting mix. Most of all, the make up and prosthetics used for Daniel Brühl in the second half of the movie is shocking and realistic. The real Nicki Lauda saw this movie on its premiere in Europe and he even said after his viewing of the recreation of the crash sequence and his subsequent injuries was an authentic and intense experience for him. Rush is more than above the average sports flick and it is not watered down to the PG-13 rating. Aside from swear words and graphic race car-related injuries, the sexual appetite and drug/alcohol abuse by James Hunt is a strong force in the movie. Such things can happen to men in a dangerous occupation like F1 racing?they often choose to live a wild lifestyle. As Hunt says in the movie, "The closer you are to death, the more alive you feel. It's a wonderful way to live." Do not be discouraged by the rating. Rush is a very good movie. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all can I say that I'm not a massive fan of formula 1. The good thing about Fast is that you really don't need to know much about he sport to enjoy it. The film is all about the rivalry between two men that are both talented, but with totally different personalities. In the case of Rush the two men in question are James Hunt and Niki Lauda. Their rivalry is similar too many others in formula one history. It is the classic battle between the racer who lives on the edge and the driver who accumulates points by not taking risks to ensure finishing in every race. The personalities of Hunt and Lauda reflect their driving styles. Their rivalry is bitter and personal and the film focuses on the world championship in the 1976 season. The film is gripping and emotional. It is edge of the seats stuff. I for one wouldn't be surprised to see a few nominations in the awards season.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Race Car Epic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In "Rush," Oscar-winning helmer Ron Howard returns to the subject matter that he cut his teeth on as a film director: fast cars. In 1977, Howard made his directorial debut with the hilarious manhunt comedy "Grand Thief Auto" (1977) for executive producer Roger Corman about characters careening around in cars. Like "Grand Theft Auto," "Rush" focuses on fast cars. Unlike "Grand Theft Auto," where amateurs did the driving, skilled professionals are behind the wheels in "Rush." Not only do they travel at higher speeds, but they also tread more treacherous roads. This polished but predictable saga has to do with the historic rivalry between Formula One British speedster James Hunt and Austrian automotive genius Niki Lauda. "Rush" spends most of its leisurely 123 minutes on its protagonists and their clashes rather than the experience of hurling along European thoroughfares at homicidal speeds in the equivalent of bobsleds on wheels with rocket fuel. Aussie-born Chris Hemsworth of "Thor" has been cast appropriately enough as Hunt, while Spanish actor Daniel Brühl impersonates Niki Lauda. Historically, Lauda and Hunt jostled each other for the top position during the 1976 Grand Prix racing season. Ron Howard keeps the soap opera scenes with the love interests of both racers to a minimum so as to maintain momentum over the long haul. Consequently, Olivia Wilde and Alexandra Maria Lara look dazzling but have little to say. Ultimately, these two competitors would come to realize that their ruthless rivalry enhanced their racetrack performance. An enduring, universal, life-truth lurks beneath all the scenic cities, challenging racetracks, and the charismatic performers in "Rush." In the self-help handbook for mercenaries and rogues in general, "The Seventy Maxims of Maximally Effective Mercenaries" observes: "The world is richer when you turn enemies into friends, but that's not the same as you being richer." "Rush" unfolds in 1976 as our protagonists are poised to race at the Nurburgring track in Germany. No sooner has Howard and Morgan established this momentous setting than they flashback to show how Hunt and Lauda got their respective starts in Formula 3 racing. Hunt's father plead with his son to become a physician. Lauda's father had planned to take his son into the family business. Naturally, neither patriarch funds their sons' racetrack fantasies, and our heroes go out and make things happen for themselves. Hunt finds a wealthy sponsor enamored of racing to put him behind the wheel, while Lauda buys his way onto the Ferrari team. Hunt treats Lauda with utter contempt and refers to him as a rat. Lauda points out rats possess a highly developed instinct for survival. Howard cuts back and forth between these two and creates some palatable suspense as they chase each other throughout the Grand Prix. Mind you, the suspense doesn't so much lie in the actual driving sequences, where speeds of 170 mph is typical, but in their face-to-face confrontations. Lauda doesn't race to defy death as Hunt does. Hunt claims woman are attracted to him because he lays his life on the line in every race. On the other hand, Lauda races to survive rather than die. He has a twenty per cent rule that governs his decision when to race. Lauda refuses to participate if the chances are greater than twenty per cent that he may perish. Hunt challenges Lauda at one point when the Austrian tries to convince his competitors to cancel the rain-swept Nurburgring track. Hunt humiliates Lauda for urging them to cancel the race. Eventually, Lauda allows himself to be brow-beaten into the race with horrendous results. The courage Lauda musters to recover so swiftly from a nearly fatal accident is inspirational and a testament to his resilience. Lauda's car crashes during the race, and he is badly burnt. Painful skin grafts and having his lungs vacuumed out ensue, and Lauda watches in horror from his hospital bed as Hunt makes up for lost time. Hunt's quick string of victories brings him close to surpassing Lauda. The rivalry really kicks in at this point, and life becomes stranger than fiction.Hemsworth and Brühl resemble their real-life counterparts. If you delay your departure when the end credits roll, you'll see the actual Hunt and Lauda. Howard slips under their collective skins with "Frost/Nixon" scenarist Peter Morgan to explore what drove them. Each racer emerges as complex and three-dimensional. Basically, they are iconoclasts who became heroic legends. Wisely, Howard and Morgan never make either one appear more sympathetic than the other. Most Hollywood movies divide and conquer when it comes to competitors. "Warrior" (2011) pitted brother against brother, and one triumphed over the other simply because he generated greater sympathy. Hemsworth has the more ostentatious role. Essentially, Hunt was either behind the wheel or in a lady's boudoir. Comparably, Brühl creates a strong impression as Niki Lauda. The ascetic Austrian driver shunned all forms of hedonism. He constituted the polar opposite of the glib, fun-loving, skirt-chasing Hunt. Lauda was a perfectionist who constantly devised ways to lighten the weight and improve the performance of his cars. Unlike the milestone racing movies "Grand Prix" and "Le Mans," "Rush doesn't deal with a single race. Instead, Howard provides a tour of the European championship racing circuit. Anthony Dod Mantle's cinematography gives us some vivid glimpses of Formula One racing from behind the steering wheel. Although we come to understand how dangerous driving a Formula One car can be, we are rarely given stretches where the drivers scramble to get beyond each other. "Rush" contains the equivalent of a 'greatest hits' montage of the various races. Spectators who don't follow Formula One specifically or car racing in general may not know that these drivers harness themselves into the equivalent of rocket-sleds with jet fuel and roar through the countryside. While speed denotes the winner, skill keeps the driver on the course. Strong characterization, some narrative surprises, and scenic locales distinguish this interesting but sedate racing epic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've never written an IMDb review before, or any review for that matter. But I had to. I knew very little about F1 and had watched one documentary about the Lauda v. Hunt rivalry. I am also REALLY picky about films (for example I don't think Harry Potter or Batman are any good). This was the most amazing film I've ever seen. Brilliant effects, superb acting, heart-wrenching drama and unbelievable action. I literally spent half the movie on the edge of my seat and the other half pressed back with my hand across my mouth in shock.Absolutely FANTASTIC!!!P.S As a Brit I'm bombarded with awful accents in movies, but Chris Hemsworth and Olivia Wilde performed nothing short of miracles with their accents and as someone with Austrian family I can safely say that Daniel Bruhl did a damn fine job with his accent.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Now I'm not a NASCAR/Formula 1 kind of guy (my dad is another story) but this film made me see the world of racing from a whole different perspective. I was worried at first that this would be another typical macho sport-racing film, but I am glad that I was proved wrong, the story of the rivalry between James Hunt and Nikki Lauda had my eyes glued to the screen. To me, the movie is perfect all around, some might complain of the pace, but to me I didn't see it as a problem. This film is directed by the amazing Ron Howard, and this will go down as one of his best films right up there with Apollo 13 and Beautiful Mind. With him on the journey is Anthony Dod Mantle who gives the film beautiful visuals with the perfect light, Peter Morgan gives us grade A writing, and Hans Zimmer gives us a masterful yet subtle score that comes in at all the right moments.The acting is nothing to complain about either, Chris Hemsworth gives us a character that we can both love and loathe, Daniel Bruhl gives the best performance as the tragic Nikki Lauda who is also the narrator of the film, he also gives us a performance that is both likable and unlikable. The scenes with his wife were amazingly well acted which leads me to the supporting female characters, the wives of Lauda and Hunt played by Olivia Wilde and Alexandra Maria Lara. Both are beautiful eye candy and both add their talents amazingly to the film.Watch out for this to be a favorite around awards season, it has the capability to be nominated in a handful of categories (Picture, Director, Supporting Actor for Daniel Bruhl, Cinematography, Score, Editing, and Sound Categories). The Academy has always loved Ron Howard and I feel that they will nominate this amazing film, and in my opinion it deserves every nomination, it is that good!My grade for Rush: A</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ron Howard has a thing for movies based on true stories (see Apollo 13, Frost/Nixon and A Beautiful Mind), but none has been quite as high- octane as Rush, which has a very different feel from his previous work. I'm not saying that's a bad thing. After all, Howard is arguably one of the most consistent directors working today as far as quality goes, and Rush is a high-quality film. However, it feels like it's lost somewhere between a drama and an action movie. There are a lot of scenes representing both genres, but the two somehow seem out of sync. Something holds Rush back from being a truly great film.Being that it's Ron Howard in the director's chair, I had high expectations for the movie, especially because it stars Thor himself, Chris Hemsworth, who is quickly becoming a household name and is deserving of a role in which he can flex his acting muscles rather than his biceps. For the most part, he does a convincing job as Formula 1 driver James Hunt. This is probably because he has Daniel Brühl to work with as his arch rival, Niki Lauda, who shares tremendous chemistry with Hemsworth. And yet, the two are comically different from each other. Hunt is the playboy, partying it up and living each day to the fullest, while Lauda is cold and calculating, as finely tuned as the machines he drives. Really, it would have been next to impossible for these two not to be rivals, and indeed that's the focus of Rush.The film takes a firm look at what it takes to be a champion and, more importantly, the cost that such a drive can have on a man. The best example is the brutal car crash Lauda experiences mid-season, from which he miraculously recovered in order to return and finish the last of the races that year. While Niki's cost was more physical, James has quite an emotionally driven journey as well, as he literally destroys his life in pursuit of that championship title. Really, it's as though the two drivers represent different aspects of one person, and the movie represents the personal tragedy from which all great tales are built.Visually speaking, this is Ron Howard's most unique film to date. It's a lot more visceral than his previous films, with sex scenes and even a few stomach-churning wrecks (Niki Lauda suffers horrifying injuries as a result of his crash). It's also a lot bolder than his previous works. Howard adopts a style meant to mirror the high-adrenaline lifestyle that these two men enjoy, with plenty of slow motion and tight editing. With all this, though, I have to ask: "Why does it feel so slow at certain parts?" I'm not normally the type of guy who shrugs off a movie's story, but I couldn't help feeling impatient waiting for the dialogue to end and the racing to begin. This is one reason I don't feel like Rush was a truly great film.I'm not saying that it's a bad film, though; quite the contrary, Rush is a very good movie, and probably one of the best racing movies ever made. It pretty much gives the audience everything they expect, and in some cases even more (props to Hemsworth for being so much more that a pretty face). I'm almost positive that it will pop up for some sort of award during the Oscars. For me, though, the film never really shifts into high gear. It doesn't cross that line into greatness, and I'm pretty sure I wont remember much about it when 2014 rolls around. That doesn't mean that it isn't worth seeing, though, and I would actually highly recommend it. After all, it's a very human tale, and it's one about which I can imagine everyone finding something to enjoy. It's just not something that echos with the viewer after the end credits.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ron Howard's "Rush" relates the true-life tale of two Formula One racecar drivers - Britain's James Hunt and Austria's Niki Lauda - whose intense rivalry helped to define the sport in the 1970s.As befits a pair of arch competitors, Hunt and Lauda were polar opposites in any number of ways. Hunt, the "bad boy," was a hard-drinking, hard-living international playboy-type with a crappy marriage - his supermodel wife (Olivia Wilde) was having an affair with no less a figure than Richard Burton - while Lauda, the "good-boy," was a work-obsessed, early-to-bed homebody with a terrific marriage to a beautiful and devoted woman (Alexandra Marlena Lara). Hunt was also devilishly handsome and sexy, a fact which garnered him a bevy of overeager groupies and celebrity status, while Lauda, with his self-described "rat face," barely registered as a blip on the cultural scene. The movie chronicles their relationship - defined by incidents of high drama and near-tragedy - both on and off the track, with each developing a grudging admiration for the other's doggedness, tenacity and undeniable devotion to the sport over time.The movie has a number of things going for it. The screenplay by Peter Morgan doesn't dumb down the characters or overdramatize the conflict between them. In addition, Chris Hemsworth and Daniel Bruhl are excellent as Hunt and Lauda, underplaying rather than grandstanding their way through their roles. And, of course, it goes without saying that the racing sequences, though truncated at times, plunge the audience right into the heart of the action in a way not available even to real-life fans of the sport, be they sitting in the stands at the track or watching at home on TV. Once again, the intimacy of the medium of film makes itself felt in a major way.Why then the overall feeling of dissatisfaction with the film, the nagging sense that, for all the quality elements that have gone into it, the movie just doesn't amount to all that much in the end? Could it be that, when all is said and done, the story really isn't all that interesting or the characters all that compelling (Hunt's wife is given particularly short shrift in the screenplay)? Whatever it is, there is something about "Rush" that keeps us from giving ourselves over to it completely. So just enjoy the performances and car races and don't expect a life-altering experience from Howard's latest feel-good opus.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was an avid fan of Formula One from 1961 to 1993 when I began losing interest since the sport has now degenerated into a technical exercise. The period of 1966 to 1983 was the greatest period in the history of the sport and 1976 one of its best years. So I went into the theater with another formula 1 friend. Both of us expected to be pointing our inaccuracies throughout the movie. Instead we left the theater thinking this is a great film and a true tribute to Hunt and Lauda and formula 1 in the 1970s. Yes, there were a few inaccurate moments (Hunt and Lauda actually liked each, but its more fun to make them insult each other whenever they meet), but that did not detract from the overall excellence of the movie and the fabulous photography. I'm going to see this movie again. . . . and again. By the way, you don't have to be a racing enthusiast to enjoy it; its simply a great movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie last night, waited for it the moment I saw the first trailer. I knew, this has to good, it just has to be. I am a Formula 1 fan and a car junkie. This is the movie we've all been waiting for, this one is for all car nuts. The two lead actors did their job perfectly, you can really see the time they invested to be perfect replicas of Niki Lauda and James Hunt. This is probably the most accurate movie inspired by real people, there is almost no Hollywood in this movie, and that is a good thing. I like that they didn't use only English, so you could hear actors speaking German and Italian. And a word about the music, Hans Zimmer did a brilliant job, his music fulfills the movie. At the end of the movie I felt sorry not to be alive and see the 1976 season for real, but I was happy to be able to see it on a big screen :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fantastic ride</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Speed. The prestige of the championship. The dance of life and death. These are some of the elements that director Ron Howard explores in his enthralling racing film, Rush. It chronicles the rivalry between James Hunt and Niki Lauda in the '76 F1 world championships and the effect that the drivers had on each other and the rest of the world. I'm glad to say that this film is a great success and ticks all the boxes in regards to pure entertainment. The first thing I noticed when watching rush was a distinct stylised filming method. The world of 1976 is represented with an amber tinting, and a layer of gloss on top. The racetracks buzz with excitement, the machines look menacing and the editing is frenetic with quick takes to boost the thrill of the races. The film looks glorious throughout and I applaud Howard for achieving this on such a low budget. The whole cast play their parts well and I was truly impressed with Chris Hemsworth, who adds a maturity to the role and displays the many sides of Hunt. Bruhl is also fantastic as the cool and calculated Lauda. I read that Bruhl spent time with the now ageing Lauda and learnt his mannerisms and accent to the point, and this is evident in the film. The pacing throughout was great and the story had a near perfect blend of humour and drama. The dialogue and banter between Lauda and Hunt is scathing and brilliant, representing their ongoing competition on and off the track. The exploration of this rivalry is the films crowning achievement, documenting each characters growth during the progression of the season. The viewer is taken on the journey and forms their own opinions on the different philosophies of both drivers. Whether or not you are a fan of F1, you will love this film. It showcases the drama, the passion and recreates a bygone era of playboy drivers willing to risk it all. The races are tense and the acting first class. Howard has crafted something special here and I recommend it to anyone searching for a great time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great F1 biopic drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rush is a biopic drama based on the real-life rivalry between the famous Formula One drivers James Hunt and Niki Lauda during the 1976 Formula One season. First and foremost, I'm not a Formula 1 fan as I find the sport uninteresting and I don't know much about the sport itself.But, I find myself drawn into this film.Different than many typical racing sports film found out there, Rush actually shows the clash between two distinctive, contrasting personalities, the passion that brought them into the sport and fears that come with it. James Hunt is a highly sociable British playboy who loves to live life dangerously close to death, have the willingness to do whatever it takes to win, a seemingly typical F1 driver. On the other hand, Niki Lauda is an eccentric, methodical, disciplined, and seemingly unsociable perfectionist, constantly assessing the odds and potential risks and outcome of things.Watching these two characters constantly pushing their limits to be the world's best racer and what drives them to win truly makes this a very engaging, entertaining, interesting drama to watch.With a great character-driven script by Peter Morgan, brilliant direction by Ron Howard, good acting performances by the two leads to provide impressive character depth and gripping, intense score composed by Han Zimmer (again), the film successfully showed both personas, allowing the audience to draw out the differences between these two men, in terms of personal values and beliefs and how they eventually develop mutual respect for the other by the end of the film.Technically speaking, it seems like Lauda is the better driver as he knows the specifics, modification, requirements of a Formula 1 car compared to James, but James' bold and determined personality also shows that he's a good driver who certainly deserves respect.The racing scenes in the film was intense and beautifully filmed. The injuries sustained by Lauda during the Nurburging crash in 1976 looks about the same in real-life. It's definitely a compelling drama worth watching, not to be missed.Rating: 8.5/10 "When I saw it the first time I was impressed. There was no Hollywood changes or things changed a little bit Hollywood-like. It is very accurate. And this really surprised me very positively." -Niki Lauda (Carjam TV Interview, September, 2013) http://yjcool.blogspot.com/2013/10/movie-review-rush.html</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I'm not a formula racing fan, but this movie kills.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm a huge Ron Howard's movie fan, and this movie just proves me right. It's a very realistic movie. It can't be otherwise, because it is about two rivals who compete with each other in Formula 1. I never watched races in my life, because I never have been attracted to something I cannot do. This movie is not about racing, it is about something else. It is a story between two men who became rivals on one day and they started to compete to each other. Filled with hate they watched death in the eye every time they stepped in their cars.What is more interesting is how this movie knows how to reach your heart. And who more can do this better than Howard? I don't think there would have been someone in the world who could have made this movie like Howard did. Soundtrack was amazing, evolvement of the characters, their game and finally their respect towards each other was astonishing. Cast was perfect. Watch this one in the cinema, it is worth it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This for me was just amazing and great! The production with the limited budget and the great directing and acting. It all works so perfectly! It is like watching art. The feelings, the hate, the fear and the urge to win, you could really feel it. And the music by Hans Zimmer, WOW! I was sitting in my seat with a big fat smile on my face when they started the cars on the Formel 1 track. I looked at my buddies beside me, they all smiled and just enjoyed it! We are a gang of old friends, we have all been driving on the track our self on Nürburgring. This movie was a journey. I would recommend everybody to go and watch this. I felt like it was over after 40 minutes. Finally a movie that gives you more than the trailer promise. Well worth the money and the time. I will also be owning this on Blu-Ray.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>For all F1 a fans and a must watch for non F1 viewers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one for me was the most awaited films of 2013. An F1 fan for more than a decade, the movie lived up to what the trailers had built up.Hats off to Ron Howard and Peter Morgan (writer) to write and make a film about F1. F1 as a sport I believe has never captured the eye on Hollywood and that's a pity considering a fact that its a very popular sport worldwide.The story set in 1970s when as James Hunt (played by a brilliant Chris Hemsworth) tells Olivia Wilde's character that a F1 car is a coffin on wheels. F1 today is a far safer sport than what was it in the 70s. The rivalry between Hunt and Lauda was at its peak. They both came from similar backgrounds of rich parents who wanted them to choose normal career paths. They objected. But where Hunt was a playboy and risk taking driver, Lauda was a risk calculating restrained driver.But the best part of the story is how they drew inspiration from each other to beat each other. Even the women with their small roles inspire the men to become better drivers. The performances are brilliant. Both Bruhl and Hemsworth shine especially Hemsworth who is sad and lonely from inside in spite of all the attention around him. I would seriously urge the producers of the Bond Franchise to seriously look at Hemsworth to replace Craig in the future. And finally, the icing on the cake is the brilliant cinematography.I took a friend along who doesn't watch F1 and questioned me why do the drivers take such risks at the beginning. By the time the film ended, he understood the madness in the sport. Rush is for F1 fans but a must watch to all those people who think its a stupid sport !! Hope like my friend they understand F1 at the end !!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A legendary duel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>World Championship Formula 1 - 1976 . After a series of battles in the lower formulas , the Englishman James Hunt and extroverted womanizer and the Austrian champion Niki Lauda introverted and meticulous compete in the race for the world title with no holds barred . Ron Howard has the great merit of being able to bring to the screen with great effectiveness one of the great duels that inflame the world sports in many disciplines . Light years now separated Formula 1 then from today , on the one hand that's good because you have made &#x200b;&#x200b;huge steps to ensure the safety of drivers and fortunately the number of serious accidents is significantly reduced. On the other hand the progress and development of the technology have made the reign of the current Formula 1 engineers and telemetry a fact which has removed much of the epic from this sport. So here we are in 1976 and catapulted in part in previous years to see the challenge between two completely different ways of being both from the human point of view both sports . Hunt exuberant , sculptural and surrounded by women and friends and obsessed with winning a world championship. Lauda , a little more meticulous and does not care to please people . The fact is that beyond the mutual rivalry the two are estimated and respect . The accident at the Nurburgring in Lauda ( think of a GP 22 km long that unraveled in the middle of a forest creeps ) is reconstructed in detail . At the same time the film does not skimp on the track of great shots and sequences of the GP in Monza with the Austrian return to racing after a month and a half from the terrible fire of his Ferrari with a sensational fourth place and the epic final race to Fuji is a real treat for the eyes. Howard said that gives us a very good film ( and make movies about Formula 1 is not at all easy ) the cast behaves really well : Hensworth finally stops on the role of Thor and it shows all. Top of the situation and the real surprise is Bruhl perfect in the role of Lauda and with a great trick for the aftermath of the accident. Well the female protagonists and a mention also to our Field bean that appears in some scenes in the role of companion Lauda , Regazzoni . In short, a tribute to the Formula 1 that was where the pilot was also mechanic and engineer but unfortunately where death was tragically commonplace.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Do You Feel That Rush?!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wow, I never knew I'd be so engrossed in a film about racecars. The main reason behind that compliment is because the film delves into so much more than the sport itself, and that's essentially what makes a great sports movie and is why most of them basically suck, in my opinion. Rush, like Moneyball before it, fully concentrates on the drive (no pun intended) and soul behind the individuals who choose to take on such risky endeavors or sports in general. The picture overwhelmingly benefits from excellent performances from Chris Hemsworth and Daniel Brühl especially. Whereas James Hunt (Chris Hemsworth) plays the stereotypical jock (ladies man, bad boy), Niki Lauda (Daniel Brühl) starts out as more of an underdog, at least, in terms of his social life. As he witnesses the environment James proudly surrounds himself with, that jealousy and bitterness can be clearly sighted in Niki's eyes. Thus, he gets down and dirty from the business side of things, and this leads to a momentous, highly personal rivalry where both persistently overpower the other with their own set of methods. As a result, the audience witnesses pure complexity and depth within these two characters with their own special backstories and circumstances; the film wisely takes the time to build each character's traits and personality up in order to create a much more satisfying ultimate showdown- the one element that always heightens the tension and popularity of a rivalry in sports: one where the opponents have fully- developed personas and distinctive characteristics. What only follows is the classic and brutal form of competition as the two racers threateningly eye each other before engaging in their next intense race. On this note, I just want to immensely praise the race sequences throughout the film, perfectly capturing the sheer adrenaline and danger of the lives these daredevils settle for. As the menacingly enormous tires of those cars loudly speed right by the camera, you immediately know you're in for the thrill of your life, meaning if you never receive the opportunity to experience such an event, this film will surely suffice. It is undoubtedly touching when the participants of these races suit up and equip those sizable helmets while knowing full well that their lives hang in the balance and their lives would mean nothing without raising the stakes. With that, the spectacular sound design considerably services these scenes with the thunderous rev of that engine and the sound of the aggressive pouring rain. Few sports movies (racing ones specifically) are able to pull off this downright level of excitement for the moviegoers are all invited to experience and participate in an incredibly immersive ride (again, no pun intended). As the adventurers race for the finish line, stoic and epically dramatic music (by the consistently-brilliant Hans Zimmer) kicks in, and as your eardrums sense the pleasure of the violins and percussion's presence, you look on to an equally grandiose occasion. Rush terrifically balances character development and characterization with these more exhilarating and athletically passionate sections. In fact, the pace is amazing since it never even felt like two hours had passed me by. You're glued to the screen from beginning to end, and there's not one segment that feels unnecessary or uneventful, and I'd go so far as to say that it's one of the best paced films of the last few years. In addition, the cinematography of the film is utterly breathtaking and beautiful, showcasing various weather conditions with the motivation of winning continuing and a display of power and vulnerability all at once as the characters resume their imposing nature. Last but not least, it's a gripping and powerful story, fueled by exceptional writing, in which two men commence a rivalry that would go on to involve numerous predicaments. I immediately identified with Niki (though ruthless in his rude behavior at first) as the underdog who feels defenseless but will go through whatever unconventional path it takes to furiously destroy his foe (who's a good man- don't be mistaken for a second- which avoids the clichés that usually infest sports movies). With that said, since the film was a sports movie at the end of the day, it still happened to lightly follow that similar structure most sports films incorporate, which creates a tad bit of predictability with its execution. Another element I just couldn't tolerate was the portrayal of the film's female characters. I did not find any of them likable at all. Most of them only "hooked up" with the protagonists because of their fame and money, and it wouldn't be a detriment to the film if it was intentional but it seemingly wasn't. For instance, Olivia Wilde is befuddled when she learns that James Hunt isn't that big of a deal. "Oh, you mean I'm not going to be sleeping with the biggest racecar star I thought he was?!" They were repulsive- however, Niki's "soul mate" was a lot more tolerable even though the relationship didn't begin at the highest of notes. In sum, Rush is now absolutely on my list for Best Picture nominees. Damn, since the fall's start, that's been three fantastic films in a row (Don Jon, Prisoners, and Rush). This season will be quite competitive indeed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Rush" mini-review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Rush" mini-review"Rush" is a compelling look into a relationship between two formula-one drivers, Austrian Niki Lauda and Britain James Hunt. At first blush, "Rush" appears to be like any other sports movie, this time about car racing. However, it's also about perseverance and about what's important in life beyond the race track. Anthony Dod Mantle's (28 Days Later, Slum Dog Millionaire) cinematography is top notch. During the movie, we see the cars from every angle, inside and out. The audience feels like they are part of the race. I will go on record right now giving Mantle the Oscar for best cinematography. Nearly as spectacular is the sound in the film. We feel and hear the roar of the formula one cars without loosing a word of dialog. The complicated blend of multiple engines, pit crews speaking, fan reactions and other ambient noises as well as the sound track makes this a challenging mix. The sound mixing is also Oscar worthy as is perennial nominee Han Zimmer's sound track. Unlike some movie composers, most notably John Williams, Zimmer can go full bore, but he knows when to pull back and let the scenes play out in near silence. Poster boy Chris Hemsworth portrays playboy racer James Hunt like a pro, but it is Daniel Bruhl as the serious, workman-like Niki Lauda that truly shines in a more challenging roll. Director Ron Howard, along with Peter Morgan's script, help us care about the flawed main characters. That is no simple accomplishment. The ending of the movie is bitter sweet as the real-life drivers play out their roles, the playboy and the technician, to the end. Rating: Pay Full Price Peace, Tex Shelters</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not just a movie about F1 and racing.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw the movie poster and the title "Rush" and that made me decide to NOT see this movie. Then I read the critics and reviews at IMDb and I changed mind. I thought; give it a try. I like F1 and car racing, but a movie should have contents and that was indeed my doubt about "Rush". This is NOT a "Fast and Furious" movie, either a "15 minutes" movie ( Robert de Niro ). This is NOT just a movie about F1 and looking at the laps the cars make. The F1, although present in the movie, is not the main subject. It is the rivalry between 2 pilots, Niki Lauda and James Hunt, which started from the moment they met through 1976, the year of the F1 accident. Their different ways of living, their work and social life. 2 completely different characters put on the screen by Daniel Bruhl and Chris Hemsworth. Both not that well known, but they both make a great role, they work fantastic good. It was not a moment boring, it was a pleasure to see Daniel and Chris doing their job and they do it very good !!! Niki Lauda is Austrian and German speaking. Daniel Bruhl talks English with a German accent and parts of the movie is originally spoken en German. This means that it is highly advisable to see this movie in original version and not dubbed.So, it is really a different movie of the other "racing movies". We have special effects, we have a bit racing, but moreover : This is a movie about 2 pilots, their life, their target, their professional attitude. And the movie is nice to see for everyone, I think children of +12 included.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Best Films of 2013</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rush is an ingenious recreation of the 1976 Formula One season and recounts the intense F1 racing rivalry between James Hunt &amp; Niki Lauda. You don't really need to be a F1 racing fan or even be aware of what actually goes on in that sport to truly appreciate this film because what it depicts in its two hours of runtime isn't something that is exclusive to this very sport; It's about how our rivals sometimes bring out the best in us when we have got something to defend or overcome.The direction by Ron Howard is brilliant, the screenplay by Peter Morgan is pretty authentic, plus the vivid cinematography &amp; concise editing only added more depth to the film's storyline but the real highlight of this film is its two fabulous performances coming from Chris Hemsworth &amp; Daniel Brühl as Hunt &amp; Lauda, respectively, amongst which Brühl ends up stealing the show in a very closely fought battle. And the music by Hans Zimmer infuses an energy of its own into this film to enrich the overall experience.On an overall scale, this film is one of the best sports dramas to come out in recent years and is an immensely well-made &amp; highly satisfying ride of adrenaline rush that delivers the goods in just the right doses with its vibrant pace, intense action, arresting music &amp; solid performances from its cast. There are minor flaws here &amp; there but most of its footing has been correct and thanks to its pure edge-of-the-seat entertainment, Rush easily storms its way into the best ranked films of 2013.Full Review at: cinemaclown.wordpress.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best film of the year so far!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the theatrical trailer, it appears that Ron Howard's first directorial project since 2011 will appeal only to sports and Formula One fans. It is a pleasant surprise when this proves entirely untrue. Rush follows the intertwining on-track careers and personal lives of James Hunt (Hemsworth) and Niki Lauda (Brühl) - one a carefree playboy with great natural talent, the other a brilliant tactician willing to work his way to the top - throughout the 1970s, culminating in their battle for the 1976 world championship. The compelling narrative, centering on the drivers' clashing personalities and progression from bitter rivals to mutual admiration, would be an enthralling tale even without the dangerous thrills of Formula One.The supporting cast all deliver strong performances (Lara is especially stunning as Lauda's ever-supportive wife), but the film belongs to Hemsworth and Brühl; thankfully their dynamic performances prove more than worthy of carrying the film. Hemsworth's Hunt wins the heart of racing sponsors, several ladies, and the audience through embodying the British superstar's wild ways, witty self-deprecation, and exuberant confidence. However, he keeps his portrayal from devolving into caricature by imbuing Hunt with a sense of loneliness underlying his charisma, perhaps an emotion he attempts to fill with the track's life-or-death thrills. Brühl, who met with Lauda several times to prepare for the role, effectively changes his accent and mannerisms to become the endlessly determined, brusque-to-the-point-of- offensive Austrian. Anyone familiar with the 1976 championship will know that Lauda's career takes a terrifying turn; Brühl keeps every ounce of characteristic blunt stubbornness whilst giving viewers glimpses of (understandable) mental distress. His nuanced performance may well be awards-worthy.While some of Howard's recent projects have not lived up to the greatness of Apollo 13, A Beautiful Mind, and Frost/Nixon, Rush is arguably of their higher calibre. Howard's eye for cinematography and framing shots is particularly striking, notably in the harrowing hospital sequences and exquisite melding of archival footage at the end. He is aided by Peter Morgan's smart screenplay and Hans Zimmer's effective score; the former keeps the plot's pace moving briskly whilst the latter evokes both the excitement of 1970s Formula One and its lethal undercurrent.Rush's greatest achievement is arguably its ability to make two deeply flawed protagonists incredibly sympathetic, involving viewers in their fierce competition and often equally tormented personal struggles. While the film centers around the ultimate contest, it is hard to take sides whilst wishing for both drivers to succeed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Excellent film, based on a true story about the rivalry between two Formula 1 drivers in the '70s. Clever way to get fast cars and things blowing up into a film without it being gratuitous. The two men call each other "asshole," and they're both well justified, but as the film goes on and the excitement and stress builds, we see flashes of the good human sides of both and it's hard to decide who to root for more.It's not often that I can sit through an entire film and be so involved at all times that I forget about time passing and never once want it to be over already, but this one achieved it. I'm not a racing fan, so I had very little background or context, but it all made perfect sense as it unrolled, and now I know a lot more about Formula 1 racing and World Championships.A couple of short scenes of injuries were hard to watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Fantastic Movie that so Happens to be About Racing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You know, I have never really cared that much for car racing in real life, and yet that does not keep me from finding Rush one of the most complete and satisfying films of 2013.The thing about Rush is that it's not really a racing movie. While the film does follow the world of Formula-One racing, it is not what the movie is about. Where Rush really accelerates and manages to resonate, is in portraying the complicated love-hate rivalry between racecar drivers James Hunt and Niki Lauda during the early 1970s.This is a true story that is so fantastic that it almost seems as if it was fabricated, but the film never feels fake or Hollywoodified. Director Ron Howard and writer Peter Morgan go to great lengths to not make it the good guy vs. bad guy scenario. They present both the flaws and the things that made Hunt and Lauda great men of the sport. Hunt's a charming, easy to like playboy who is self-destructive, and Lauda is so calculating and abrasive he rarely shows emotion or vulnerability, and yet you've gotta love a man who is not afraid to say what he thinks. Featuring some of the most exciting cinematography from Anthony Dod Mantle since he won the Oscar for Slumdog Millionaire, and some genuinely whip smart editing, you really get the feeling of being in this world, on the track with these titans of racing. What manages to evoke this feeling is Howard's documentary like approach to the material.Ron Howard really is a chameleon of a director. He never makes the same movie twice, and there really is no other film in his filmography quite like this one. He sheds many of the genre conventions that you find in his other works for a stripped down, realistic approach. You feel as if you're a fly on the wall watching the ultimate racing doc that's all rock-and-roll. Then there's the rocking Seventies setting that's equal parts nostalgic and cool, by and large thanks to the surprisingly nuanced and of-the-times musical score from Hans Zimmer. However, there is also a heart to this movie that is both a testament to Howard's ability to shape smart characters and the performances of his actors. These two things combine to make these character's oddly likable, even when they aren't always the nicest of people.Overall, Rush is simply put, a phenomenal experience at the theater. It's a movie that can be fun, emotional, and thoughtful all in one. It paints the picture as to why we need rivalries in life. There has to be something pushing us to greatness, and very often a healthy rivalry is the only way to get there. Even if a Formula-One movie isn't your cup of tea, I implore you to at least give the film a chance as a character piece. Stars Chris Hemsworth and Daniel Bruhl compliment one another in their performances very much the same way that Hunt and Lauda did on the racetrack, and sometimes you don't need flowery words to express how much a performance, or in this case, two performances work. Rush is definitely a movie I will be revisiting in the future and is one that I will more than likely include, very proudly I might add, on my year end best list.I give Rush a 10 out of 10!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Anyone knows that Ron Howard always makes a good movie and he can bring true stories to the big screen so well, and here he did just fine with "Rush" the real life story of a 1970's rivalry between two world class formula one race car drivers. You have mister hotshot himself points leader and ladies man playboy type the English man James Hunt(Chris Hemsworth). And aside from the hard life of drinking and partying and going to bed with beautiful women left and right he wins race after race around the globe all of a sudden James has a challenge and that's in the form of new driver the serious Austrian Niki Lauda(Daniel Bruhl in a great performance). These two rivals are different like daylight and dark their personal styles go like for one Niki is cool and calm and quiet and pretty boy James is never at a loss for attention. Yet the subplots of personal styles take a backdrop to the thrilling scenes of the heart pounding races the two have against each other on international tracks. This film really did a good job with it's recreation of telling the 1970's world of formula one racing which had a rivalry that not many people knew about. "Rush" is a film of personal connection and friendship proving that life is close and always a race on the track no matter what lap you finish in.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the BEST MOVIES OF THE YEAR for sure. This movie is about friendship, marriage, attaining goals, perseverance. I was kept on the edge of my seat throughout the movie. Never a dull moment. Lovely vintage race cars. This movie will motivate you to get off your ass to "do it". The sex scenes in this movie are as wild as the racing. Yet, this movie has a beating heart; a heart that beats at 10,000 rpm. You absolutely must see this movie. One of the best racing and friendship movies of all time. Why as I write this, it is rated in the top 100 movies of all time.The sound track is strong. The visuals make you feel you are actually racing. You care about these characters through their all dilemmas and triumphs. I am exhausted after seeing it. And I have seen it 7 times. Go to U-Tube and look over videos which are 1 hour long regarding the rivalry between Niki Lauda and James Hunt. View the entire length and marvel at the authenticity of this movie; and notice how closely the real people resemble the actors in this movie.Take a date to this movie. How it is that anyone could criticize it in any technical or dramatic fashion is beyond me. Every scene is finely crafted. I am a professional photographer and I admire the direction and choices the screenwriter and director have made. Sure, there are those that want more racing track time, but this is a deeper story about friendship and rivalry. You must see it in your lifetime.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Thoroughly enjoyed "Rush." Ron Howard creates an energetic, compelling, and highly detailed world, and populates it with equally vivid real-life characters. I'm a film and motorsports geek, but rarely do the film and motorsports worlds intersect to produce anything good. "Rush" is, happily, the exception to the rule.The film avoids all the tired old "racing movie" pitfalls: the nearly-irresistible force dragging producers and directors toward the action movie genre, the romanticized homage to historical figures living and dead, the dumbed-down "good guy vs. bad guy" duel, ad nauseam. Instead, Howard knocks us back into our seats with an intimate, visceral impression of the the speed and danger of 1970s Formula One racing. He captures the essence of motorsport, that melding of the human will with the brute force of the machine, like no one else ever has. And he also shows the unavoidable, painful truth. That the technology of speed has always advanced more rapidly than the science of safety.So Howard creates a nearly perfect movie universe for Rush. But that's only the director's 3rd most important task. The two most important tasks are hiring the right actors, then getting the best possible performances out of those actors. I think Hemsworth and Bruhl are excellent choices. The former has the charisma needed to portray Hunt, the latter the intensity needed to play Lauda. And Bruhl absolutely nails Lauda's accent.But if there is a weakness to Howard's work in Rush, it is that he sometimes doesn't get maximum performances out of his actors. Occasionally, simply hiring the right actors is enough and much of the production just falls into place. Other times, the director needs to work his or her voodoo to get actors to cry, laugh, and achieve peak performance. Several of the film's scenes fell flat emotionally (especially the ski trip argument scene and subsequent restaurant scene.) They could have been big acting moments, they could have added more depth to the film, but it just didn't happen. It felt like Howard either told the actors to pull it back a little to keep the film "lighter" or simply didn't feel like expending a lot of energy shooting alternate takes.I doubt the lack of a big acting moment will have even the slightest effect on the film's box office, but it's just about the only thing preventing me from giving the film 10 stars. I enjoyed the film on many levels, and I think there's something for everyone to love about the film. And yes, I expect Rush to get a best picture Oscar nomination.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I rarely eulogise about big ?budget cinema nor do I exalt the virtues hyped-up films with big marketing budgets, I find them all too often under-cooked. Rush is certainly the exception to the rule.The characters are fully formed, the plot is purposefully driven and the script is nicely punctuated with recurring humour and clearly developed acts that move the story forwards while retaining a sense of it's self.If you don't know the story already, then you're in for a treat. If you do; then you've the opportunity to get the full visceral fly-on-the-wall experience of what was happening behind-the-scenes (artistic licence seems to be within a fair margin of error).Ron Howard seems to flit between the sublime and the ridiculous, with Rush most definitely being the former rather than the latter.The casting of Hemmsworth as Hunt was always going to cause ructions, but to my taste he manages to effortlessly embody everything about the racing "superstar"; from the 70s swagger to the clipped speech pattern Hemmsworth delivers a memorable and driven performance.The real star of the show however is neither Howard or Hemmsworth, but the excellent Daniel Bruhl as Austrian racing legend Nikki Lauder. Having been an admirer of talents for a while, it was only a matter of time before the promise shown in Goodbye Lenin, the Edukators, Inglorious B's etc led to leading roles in major international productions. His performance in Rush is as measured as it is passionate and (admittedly helped by the story) it's Bruhl who comes out with the most credit.With an admirable lack of profanity Ron Howard and counter-parts have skilfully delivered the best racing movie in many a long year.Rush is a film made with enough craft to draw you in and entertain you, and far more than enough guile to keep you intrigued long after the credits have rolled.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Little Red-headed Woman and I went with great anticipation and were not disappointed. This is a great movie. Set the same year I turned 21, this film looks just like the 70s did. Much of it appears a little washed out as you would expect if you were to see film shot from that period. The cinematography is stunning. While I remembered the names of the F1 drivers from that era, I remembered nothing of the story.Don't read up on this before you see the movie. Not knowing what happens only makes this a better experience. This is F1's version of the great Johnny Mac vs. Bjorn rivalry, but with death and destruction and not fuzzy little balls and high dollar rackets.While this is a guy movie, the wifey loved it. About 2/3rds of the way through she told me she needed to go to the sand box and relieve herself. I said, Go. She said, "I not missing a minute." There are no minutes to be missed. This is balls to the walls good cinema.The only down side is movies like this make 98% of the others movies look like manure. Superb acting, editing, action.....it is all there.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was a fan of formula 1 then and am still a formula 1 fan.James Hunt was one of the most charismatic drivers the UK has ever produced and I am pleased to say this film faithfully conveys that mix of Button/Hamilton/Beckham/Best which he seemed to embody to a public who were only just starting to appreciate the idea of celebrity in a way which we take for granted now. The fact that he died so young and in such obscurity makes this story so tragic and moving. I was so pleased that there was a clear demonstration of mutual respect by the two protagonists if only in the very last minutes of the film.Nikki Lauder remains quite rightly one of the most influential men in F1 , a portent of which is clearly demonstrated by his early genius.Personally I found the whole experience of watching their story incredibly emotional and brilliantly portrayed on every level,directing/acting/ filming and effects, oh yes and not to forget a superb soundtrack by the ubiquitous Hans Zimmer( how does he keep doing it?).I will go again, and buy the blue-ray as soon as its available.....well done everyone involved.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Just Cars Driving in Circles</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just look at that face on the poster. Who cares if the film looks like it's about men in fast cars going around in a circle? This is the perfect date movie. You have both action and meaningful dialog. RUSH tells the true story of the inexplicably long rivalry between two race car drivers in the 1970s. We follow Mr Hunk (James Hunt), and Mr Rat Face (Niki Lauda) as they fight to maintain their first place Grand Prix title from each other.Thank the heavens this isn't a 3D movie, the action was intense enough. RUSH goes deep into the weighty topics of life. You will find your brain grappling with the meaning of friendship, ambition, even marriage. We watch Hunt and Lauda mature and adjust their priorities in life. Well at least Lauda does. Chris Hemsworth, playing James Hunt looks every bit the Bad Boy with boundless energy for women, booze, drugs, and looking death in the eye with every race. Daniel Brühl plays the contradictory Niki Lauda, equally motivated to win, but by his own strict set of rules calculated to avoid death.As the story unfolds we meet girlfriends, managers, drivers, investors and assorted 1970s stereotypes that serve to flesh out the incalculable motivations and pressures involved in keeping the show on the road. Everyone has something to lose. Niki learns that happiness is the enemy. "It means you have something to lose." James seems to be suppressing his thoughts and feeling throughout the film with his physicality.Trust me, RUSH is, well, a rush. (impulse control issues)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dramatic tension and Authenticity of F1 in the 70's</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Making films about real life characters always presents a challenge; more so if one of them doesn't live to see the day his tale is made into a film. Coming from director Ron Howard, known for films like 'Apollo 13', 'A Beautiful Mind', 'Da Vinci Code', 'Rush' is about two great personalities in the high adrenalin Formula 1 racing. The story begins on the start line where Niki Lauda (Daniel Brühl) narrates the story of how James Hunt (Chris Hemsworth) influenced his life and the days of Formula 1 in the 1970's where it was not uncommon for drivers to die in accidents. James Hunt, who in real life was known as a playboy is appropriately portrayed on screen. There's a scene from his early days where he walks into at a hospital to get his injuries treated and lo behold, he seduces the nurse in James Bond style! Then, we are introduced to his career in Formula 3 where he drives for Lord Hesketh's team. Although the film marks the meeting of Lauda and Hunt in the F3 race on a sour note, it is believed that the duo were actually friends and shared an apartment during their early days. Was this an error? Or was it deliberately avoided to bring about dramatic tension between its lead stars right from the start? We wouldn't know. The character of Niki Lauda starkly contrasts with Hunt as he is cool, calculating, working with the team on developing the car and isn't bothered about partying or popularity. In real life too, it is believed that Lauda never let the achievements get into his head and he gave away his trophies to a local garage in exchange for car wash.Discussing the story itself isn't necessary for the review as most of the critical elements of the plot are based on actual, well known events. Its most poignant moment is how Lauda returns to track merely six weeks after a near-fatal crash with bandages on his wounds and leads the championship till he pulls out of the season's last race at Fuji when the treacherous weather conditions made the race too dangerous. 'Rush' does a wonderful job in recreating the F1 races, the imagery of powerful engines, tires ready to zoom as pedal hits metal, and the infamous Nürburgring crash of 1976. In fact, Niki Lauda in his interviews has praised the filmmakers for portraying the crash and his treatments in a realistic manner and that the scenes 'shocked' him. Reportedly, the actors weren't allowed to drive real Formula 1 cars. So, the film makers are said to have used F3 cars with the bodywork of F1 cars of that era to make them look like the real deal. Still, they drove some mean machines. Wow! The actors have done a good job and look like their real life counterparts. Chris Hemsworth still seems like Thor with the long hair, but less bulky. Daniel Brühl, an acclaimed German actor embodies the role of Lauda, Olivia Wilde as Suzy Miller, Alexandra Maria Lara as Marlene Knaus and Pierfrancesco Favino as Clay Regazzoni have done a neat job and there's not a moment where it feels inauthentic. What works for the movie, other than the stunningly recreated visuals is the emphasis on its characters. At its soul is the portrayal of how Hunt and Lauda influenced each other's lives and careers. Although the two champions were very different by their outwardly lives, they shared a common passion for racing and winning and looking at each other to seek the much needed challenge and why you need enemies!Verdict: if you are one of those who like Bollywood family dramas branded as racing films, like Ta Ra Rum Pum, let me assure you that 'Rush' isn't for you. But, if you are a Formula 1 fan, don't even think twice; just go for it.</fullReview>

Anyways here goes my review: RUSH has got to be one of the best made sports movies for 2013, no question about it. Without revealing any spoilers here -it gets the highest rating for telling a great story and delivering it with style, very reflective of the period. Special effects were limited but tastefully done. Ron Howard did a masterful job. The two actors made the characters very believable and come to life just as one expected them. the pace was very gripping (pun intended!) and all of the supporting cast were excellent. Caution on the language and bits of nudity for those who may think of taking the young ones along for the experience. Enjoyed the whole movie, lots of witty dialog and the whole theater erupted in a standing ovation at the end. I guess that says it all.</fullReview>

This has made me respect all the drivers from and before this era when I realised the dangers faced and the death rate per season .i think it could have been the start of the stricter safety rules observed today. The two actors playing James Hunt and Niki Lauda are completely believable and a joy to watch the duel unfold Gosee this it is a classic film about human competiveness ,respect and ultimately motor racing</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The tale of 3 F1 drivers..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First thing that struck me when I watched this flick was that 'why hasn't anyone in Hollywood thought of this before?'. Apart from gangster flicks and war-dramas, high octane action sequences are not the norm for bio-pics. This one kicks up your adrenaline from frame one. Those race sequences are just amazing and lifelike and dialogs are sharp and succinct. Cinematography puts you in the driver seat and Bruhl as Lauda and Hemsworth as Hunt are chalk and cheese. Hemsworth's roguish, play boyish, devil may care attitude provides the perfect antithesis to Bruhl's composed, demure persona. Ron Howard has pulled all the right strings to make this movie an epic, just as the rivalry between Lauda and Hunt. This is a must watch for any F1 fan. P.s:- I almost forgot Coimbatore is the hometown of the only F1 driver to represent India and that's whom we(me and Nithin Pbv) exactly ran into. Watching a movie on Formula 1 with Narain Karthikeyan himself is just the icing on the cake. Now beat that :P</fullReview>

It really was amazing and I must admit I had a few tears but that was properly because I am just a big girl. Lol. I seriously recommend this film, its enjoyable for everyone. I think the fact it is based on a true story also makes it more interesting and I think that is partly why I enjoyed it so much, it is very factual to what really happened and the story of James and Niki's friendship is also really nicely executed. Peter Morgan did an amazing job writing the screenplay and I think Ron Howard did a great job directing the film and he executed it very well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A movie that blends racing &amp; drama perfectly. Rush, is a masterpiece!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rush is a biopic about the infamous rivalry between F1 racers James Hunt(Chris Hemsworth) &amp; Niki Lauda(Daniel Bruhl) set during the 1970s. The movie basically chronicles the two racers lives right from when they were just petty F3 racers to when they competed together in the 1976 Grand Prix. This movie is absolutely flawless. If I had to pick one flaw then, it would be the fact that James Hunt vomited before each race. I didn't see the point of doing that. The way Ron Howard, the director, has shot the races is surreal &amp; otherworldly. You feel like you're racing at the track. This movie keeps you on the edge of your seat right till the end. I liked the fact that even though Hunt &amp; Lauda were rivals on the track, they had immense respect for each other off it. The viewer has no idea as to who is going to win the Grand Prix. Hunt or Lauda. However, both characters are equally likable. So, it didn't bother me as to who's going to win, in the end. Chris Hemsworth is charming &amp; suave as James Hunt. However, the highlight of the film is Daniel Bruhl. His performance as Niki Lauda is mind blowing. Bruhl had a tougher role to play &amp; he absolutely nailed it. Olivia Wilde is great as Suzy Miller. Alexandra Maria Lara is brilliant as Marlene Lauda. Pierfrancesco Favino is impressive as Clay Regazzoni. The supporting characters are effective as well. Rush is a must watch. Go for it as soon as possible.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the midst of mediocrity in cinemas at present, Rush is a welcome boost in the right direction. From the very first scene you are hooked; the roar of the engines, the visuals are engrossing and you already find yourself anticipating what's round the bend.It's refreshing, a unique film with real life circumstance; allowing you to witness such a powerful story of rivalry. Rather than film after film after film of the same nonsense, regurgitated, swallowed, then brought up again. I had recently seen "White House Down" and this mows it down and continues to do so for 60 laps. Both lead performances are outstanding; you find yourself constantly switching your allegiance; supporting Hunt,then agreeing with Lauda. You feel yourself within their fiery feud. For me it's Daniel Brühl who gives the best performance. He is without a doubt, one for the future. This was obvious from his role in Inglorious Basterds and this just etches his potential further.a scintillating, raw classic worthy of a the ticket fee.8.25/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film about fast cars and some seventies nostalgia too.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Film is from StudioCanal who also made 'Senna' (2010). The Director is Ron Howard who in 1995 directed 'Apollo 13'.This film is set in the seventies world of Formula One racing and deals with the rivalry between the drivers Niki Lauda and James Hunt.Film opens appropriately at the start of a race before giving us some back-story. A slightly-bloodied figure, wearing something like an Apollo space-suit, looking something like a Greek god, enters a hospital. He is James Hunt the racing-driver.Chris Hemsworth plays the part of James Hunt. This is the first time this reviewer has seen Chris Hemsworth. He looks like Brad Pitt, he looks and sounds like Roger Moore, he would make a very believable Alexander The Great. He has a big presence and dominates in his scenes.Ever since the gladiators of Ancient Rome, right up to the present time, certain occupations, such as; gladiators, firemen, gangsters, soldiers and racing-car drivers, have held a fascination. Narration by the James Hunt character explains why. The precarious life-style is attractive, exciting and glamorous. It is never explicitly stated why this film is entitled 'Rush'. However the whole film implicitly tells us that it is about the adrenalin-rush that comes from the speed and the life-style. That is what attracts ordinary people and that is what drives the participants. That drug-like addiction to drive and race is shown well.James Hunt came from a comfortable background, but film shows how enthusiastic amateurs, with a modest amount of money, could build their own Formula Three racing-cars in their garages, and then race them. To succeed as a racing-driver though, required the good luck of being talent-spotted, and then sponsored, by rich backers.The young James Hunt meets Niki Lauda played by Daniel Bruhl. Lauda is Austrian,his character has a Germanic-like intensity which is the complete opposite of the debonair Hunt. Lauda is obsessed, in a German-engineering way, in the technical side of racing. A workaholic who expects the same from those around him. By contrast Hunt is a playboy, driven to drive, driven to take risks, but also happy to indulge fully in the life-style made possible by his occupation. The interplay between the two drivers is both entertaining and intense. The competition between their different philosophies is at the heart of this drama.Other drivers are just nameless faces in the background, and it is correct that this is so, as anything else would distract from the central struggle between the two drivers. There is one exception; Clay Regazzoni. He it was, who in real-life, contributed in a very important way to this story. This is not clear in the film but it is right that he features in it. Perhaps this is a tribute to him. Certainly he would be a worthy subject of a film himself. He is played, superbly, by Italian actor Pierfrancesco Favino.The actor with the top -billing in this film is Daniel Bruhl who plays Niki Lauda. He is the real star of the show. Chris Hemsworth showed well the intensity of the desire to drive by James Hunt, but playing a good-looking sex-symbol did not stretch him to the extent as did the Niki Lauda role for Daniel Bruhl. Much more was asked of him, and he delivered.This movie was filmed in such a way as to give us a truly authentic rich-colour seventies feel to it. All other seventies details strike an authentic note too. Younger viewers may be shocked to see hospital staff smoking, but yes, smoking was as ubiquitous as it is shown in this film. Cars, vans, haircuts and jackets too, all looked in place. Some contemporary seventies music, placed Scorsese-like, in the background, also hit the spot.Familiar with the seventies, this reviewer recently revisited them, when I went to see 'The Battle of the Sexes', a documentary about the famous tennis match. I was unsure the details of this event and was happily reminded of the seventies decade. I knew the general story of the documentary 'Senna' and so decided to avoid it. With the 'Rush' story, I knew the general details, but not the finer details, and so was genuinely excited about how things would turn out in the film. The second-half of this film is almost totally about the racing and it is very exciting.All racing-enthusiasts should enjoy this film. However there is something here for people of all tastes. Director Ron Howard, like he did in 'Apollo 13', has been able to take a true story, and craft it into a great drama. While sexual-athlete James Hunt does engage in a lot of soulless sex (see the mirror), this film does also have time for romance too. Film is at times very emotional, and as the film progresses, the two protagonists find out things about each other, so do we. The recent 'About Time' was a celebration of life, so too is this film. The decade of the seventies was crazy, dangerous and wild. "Ayds helps you slim" was then merely an advertising slogan for a slimming product. James Hunt was the largest of those larger-than-life characters. Niki Lauda by contrast was the process-obsessed technician with an iron-will but perhaps the most human. Brad Pitt's Achilles in 'Troy' (2004), said that the gods envied us for the way we lived our lives. Too true. Enjoy life, enjoy the rush, enjoy this film. Magnificent! 10/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Rush features great acting, atmosphere and music, and I would say it could be a strong Oscar/BAFTA contender. It's among the best films I've seen for some time (among the few films that I have really enjoyed). The film captures the atmosphere of the 1970s and things like the weather conditions on the track, really well, without resorting to gimmicks or 3D effects. It's a revelation to see how dangerous conditions on the track actually are if you are not that interested in car racing. It will also appeal to women (I'm one) as well as men, since the action on the race track and 'car speak' are not too dominant.The performances by the two male leads are sterling, and it is a nice touch to see the real Hunt and Lauda towards the end of the film. Chris Hemsworth shows that he has a broader range than just fantasy films, and Daniel Brühl is excellent as Lauda. The acting by the supporting cast is otherwise good throughout, but ? rightly in my view ? the film focuses on the two key personalities of Hunt and Lauda.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Capturing the true spirit of Formula 1 on film is challenging. The sport does not lend itself easily to the medium of cinema- it is a popular genre but it's still seen as a niche market in some ways. Yet behind the corporations and money men there is a deeply human side to the sport that Rush captures perfectly.Racing drivers are human beings, subject to the same forces as the rest of us, and back in the 1970s, the sport was far more dangerous than it is today. To become an F1 driver was to know that two out of twenty-five drivers would die each year- with the risk of serious injury never far away. To take such risks on a regular basis meant you had to be a certain type of character to jump into the car.What Rush does is tap into that human side of racing. Chris Hemsworth takes on the role of playboy James Hunt, who drinks, smokes and sleeps (with several women) through F1, and who is fully prepared to put his life on the line is pursuit of glory. Chris, formerly of superhero Thor fame, is great as the arrogant yet likable Hunt, capturing his fragile side too- beneath the partying and exuberance is a man who needs the thrill of dangerous racing to feel alive.Daniel Bruhl is Niki Lauda, a no-nonsense, ultra-serious guy who takes a keen interest in the cars he drives, seeking to maximise their potential whilst minimising the risk. Whilst for Hunt it's all about the thrill, for Lauda it's about business and professionalism. Yet both desire victory and championships. They are polar opposites and push each other hard- Bruhl captures Lauda's attitude and strict approach really well, sounding just like him, acting just like him.The film pulls no punches with driver accidents and Lauda's own serious accident either. It gives us a glimpse into what Lauda went through and into his recovery and bravery as well.In short, both actors give a good account of themselves as two of Formula 1's most amazing figures- and Ron Howard has done a fantastic job of recreating the cars and scenery of the era. The cars are faithfully reproduced and look incredible. The blend of real machinery and CGI is done so well that you almost can't tell the two apart. The film is great, whether you love Formula 1 or not.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Must see!! Awards to come!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While I went to the advanced screening of this a lifetime race fan and movie buff, I was awed by the beauty and sophistication of this Ron Howard work.The protagonists truly embody the characters they portray in so that in the final moments of the film, you can't help but shake your head at how close they are to the real life men. I did worry at how Daniel Bruhl would take his character in the first few moments but soon relaxed into his portrayal. The cinematography of this film is noting short of stunning! As an attendee of many forms of racing, they capture the blood rushing adrenaline that accompanies the sport in the races and sometimes left me on the edge of my seat waiting to see what would happen. Not only that, but the angles on the racetrack that captured leaves blowing or other simple transitions throughout were absolutely breathtaking in their simplicity and design. Finally, the filtering and FX made me feel like I was watching my parent's old home movies at times. Spot on in transporting me back to a time before my age and making it feel so real.I do hope to see this film capture the hand during awards season. It wouldn't be a film I'd watch many times (because of the subject) but it is absolutely one of the best I've seen in a while. Notes: ~Fellow viewers (mostly female) reported they thought it was "too long". ~Some scenes may be too graphic for younger and sensitive audiences. Both gore and the lovely view of Chris Hemsworth's deliciously chiseled backside. ~Counting websites will take note on the number of times arsehole was said. It became comical! Also, nipples. There are quite a few so see note above.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the most Under-rated Movie of the 2013</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With little knowledge of what the movie was all about i bought the DVD of the movie and saw it. It proved to be such a pleasant surprise. The basic premise of the movie is healthy, competitive and life altering rivalry between Nikki Lauda and James Hunt. Famous F1 drivers of mid 70s who went on to become world champions.Nikki Lauda is world champion and is competing with James Hunt for the title for the year 1976. Ron Director of the movie has given such brilliant portrait of both the drivers. Nikki is shown as technically correct, focus and highly skilled driver. James Hunt is flamboyant driver, who is more courageous and has nothing to lose. The Championship is a critical junction when Nikki meets with an accident and gives opportunity to James Hunt to cash on and he does. James Hunt wins the World Championship for the year 1976. One of the capturing moments in the movie is when Nikki Lauda makes a come back after getting seriously injured and wins the fourth position in race. Daniel Bruhl gave fantastic performance. little do i know why he was not nominated for Oscars. Nikki was true star though he lost the Championship but still remained the winner. Amazing heart capturing movie. Loved the way it was directed.It is sometimes great to have rivals who can make you excel in life. Story of Nikki and Hunt. Must Watch...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best movies of 2013</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sports themed movies rarely make it to my personal list of movies I want to go watch, and even more rarely they make a lasting impression. Well, this first sentence was only true before I went to watch Rush. I give you, that my two and only reasons to go and see this movie were the leads - Chris (think Thor)and Daniel (ah, Good Bye Lenin and 7 dias en La Habana, and boy I'm happy I did. I must say that my interest in F1 was quite superficial, and only in the 1990s I was somewhat caught by the sport when the statistically (and statistically he IS) the best driver of F1 ruled the track,and I've never really troubled myself with F1 history and all those discussions of who's the best and all, thus the story behind 1976's F1 championship was totally new to me. Getting back more closely to the movie, I'd say just this - in my opinion Rush is the best 2013 movie I've seen, Chris and Daniel did wonderful jobs, and if this movie won't get any nominations (think Oscars) I'll be very very surprised. And now I'm off to continue with some old F1 GPs videos and some documentaries as the movie's so great that I'm actually inspired to dig deeper into the story itself. 10 out of 10 and a huge +</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went to see this movie because I heard it was good and I love the actors.I was pleasantly surprised to find it was SO entertaining and the story so engrossing.I was even more intrigued when I learned it was a true story! The writing and the acting were so brilliant that I fell in love with each character, and I debated throughout the entire movie, "Which character do I like better??" (I would swing back and forth, but ultimately my heart went to Niki) The acting was spectacular. While I knew Chris Hemsworth would be outstanding, I was AMAZED by Daniel Bruhl! WOW. Both actors had fantastic chemistry and I totally believed they were lifelong racing brothers who had love/hate feelings for each other, leading towards boundless respect in the end.On some level, this felt like a Love Story, a story of redemption, and a story of brotherhood and loyalty.I walked out of the theater feeling inspired. Happy. Deep in thought. And most amazingly, CURIOUS and eager to know MORE about the world of Formula 1 Racing, cars, and the real life Niki Lauda &amp; James Hunt!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The film unfolds like a feast of tasty appetizers that never settles into a meal.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's my firm belief that if you have to start a movie in medias res and go back to the beginning, then your original beginning isn't strong enough. This holds true in Ron Howard's latest film about F1 racing legends, the Maverick Brit James Hunt and his prickly Austrian rival Niki Lauda, where the movie opens at a critical moment only to immediately go back in time to recap. Ron Howard knows how to create drama, pace and suspense perfectly but there seemed to lack a cohesive narrative thread that would have made Rush outstanding.What I liked: The movie is as slick as a race car and the racing scenes are wonderfully executed, especially when there is poor weather conditions. The movie is certainly entertaining. The characters and relationships however are underdeveloped and, frankly, a little wasted; except for Daniel Bruehl who plays Niki Lauda and adds all the heart and soul to this film. He is brilliant and seemingly reaches beyond the written character, if I am to compare him to Chris Hemsworth's less dynamic portrayal. Somehow, while Hemsworth is convincing his character, ironically, lacks the charm to carry the emotion of each short scene, whereas Bruehl's Lauda grows on us and stays with us. The best moments of the film come late when we come to respect the rivalry as they do. I enjoyed that there is no definitive hero and both characters make for a series of well captured scenes but?What I didn't like: The film unfolds like a feast of tasty appetizers that never settles into a meal. The story is interesting and there are well-executed moments of real connection and emotion but they never last long enough or fit properly to create a fluid whole. The camera-work by Anthony Dod Mantle was electric and worked very well in some seems but, again, seemed to piece together different moods or ideas that contributed my overall sense of disharmony.My rating: Wishing for an Oscar nod for Daniel Brühl.http://canyoutellastory.wordpress.com/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Unexpected from a racing film, this movie is a sure was to indulge yourself in the realm of competition and rivalries within sport. With the exception of Ron Howard, all aspects of this film where keeping me from seeing it. However, the racing (Formula 1) aspect is the least poignant part of the film. As always, Howard's multi-faceted approach to a film is a grasping angle to what this film offers. Hemsworth's role was far from the macho and mundane characters he has been type-casted in in the past, and Brulh's performance is probably the best of the film. The dynamic relationship between the two main characters and their impeccable direction of their story, from Howard, makes this film an enjoyable watch and perhaps a reference point for the genre of future racing films, that until now have always exhausted my senses.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is fantastic. It turned out better than I thought it would and not as cheesy. I find stories about two different opposing forces that has the equal tenacity and drive colliding with each other to be awesome. In this case, one is the wild card, a charger that relies on his senses. And the other is the more disciplined one, the brain that relies on his calculations and instincts. Although the bad blood aspect of this film might not be real. There is just way more tension if you don't do research on the outcome, before watching this movie. Also this is a bit of a cheap shot, but Chris Hemsworth basically plays Thor with no powers in this. Daniel Brühl was just awesome as Nikki Lauda. Overall this is one of the top rivalry films I have seen.8.2/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Daniel Brühl, who else? He not only plays Lauda, he is Lauda. I watched the cultural Monday-Night Program on ORF2 (the ORF is the Austrian Broadcasting Corporation), when Niki Lauda, Daniel Brühl and Peter Morgan had been interviewed. Niki Nationale has given Brühl his sanctus.On the same day, when Lauda crashed and burned in the Green Hell, in Vienna collapsed a famous bridge into the Danube. I was a five year old boy living in the suburbia of Vienna and honestly the bridge affected me more. The Death-Toll was one in Vienna, almost one in Germany. When Lauda realized that a priest was at his bed in the hospital, he mobilized all his mental power and came back from the valley of death. (AND the doctor said, Lauda survived because he was NON SMOKING - a fact, that young people should think about!)James Hunt meant nothing to me, until the movie-project came into the headlines. I think Chris Hemsworth fits perfect in the role.RUSH is one of the best movies about racing and one of the best movies of the Year 2013.Thank you Peter Morgan. Thank you Ron Howard.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Rush is a cinematic masterpiece ? a truly great time at the movies for almost everyone to enjoy. I was surprised by Thor (Chris Hemsworth) who seamlessly transitioned from hyperbolic cartoon superhero into a real-life legend. His acting was nearly flawless and never overdone. His German counterpart, Daniel Bruhl, brought another breath of fresh air to our Canadian theaters. You could almost taste the tension between the opposing personalities ? and it never failed to thrill!In addition to great acting, the filming was absolutely breathtaking: you will literally be on the edge of your seat for the entire two hours. I would highly recommend this movie to sports fans and non-fans alike. There is a perfect mixture of sass and sport to make this movie a perfect date night flick!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I came to the movie because I remember that Formula1 season, and the thrill of a Brit winning the Championship for the first time in a decade. I had only ever seen a few minutes of a Hemsworth in Thor, and had low expectations of a comic book Ozzie actor. I was wrong, the story is brilliantly told, and the movie captures perfectly a less PC, less rigid, less technical, more colourful, more risky and more exciting motor sport era. Hemsworth turns out to be a charismatic actor who brings a sense of the dangerous (reckless) energy that Hunt had as the last off the. 'Gentlemen amateurs'. Lauda heralded a new era and proved that although less reckless, he embodied courage in a different way. The rivalry was real and fuelled a great seasons racing. The movie really caught the era for me, the background captured perfectly in flashes of news, fashion, and a general looseness that is missing from our photoshopped era. Supporting actors are great, Olivia Wilde even looks like Suzy Hunt as I remember her... But the main thing is that the pace is like a race, and the movie drew me in with real drama, no mean feat given that I already knew who won! I don't understand some of the pedants who think their view of this history does how supersedes all others. For me this was real as it should be and dramatic as it could be. As for some prurient type complaining at seeing Hemsworths buttocks, go watch the latest Disney film, and leave this for the adults amongst us. Fantastic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The HUNT for the next great racing flick is over. Allow me to LAUDA merits of this great film of racing history.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are no spoilers in this review of Rush, for the 1976 Grand Prix championship was settled long ago. That it was done in the most unexpected fashion under torrential conditions by the shadow of majestic Mount Fuji, in the legendary racing circuit of the same name, has perhaps made it all the more a hallowed story of Formula One history. Books have been written and documentary films have been made recounting the lives of James Hunt and Niki Lauda many times over. Even the tapes of the live broadcast still exist. A tricky thing, making a story interesting despite everyone already knowing how it all went down.Yet, Ron Howard does just that. As expected, there are embellishments, so let's get the biggest one out of the way: Hunt and Lauda never met in that particular F3 race. It is something that has been pointed out when production photos were leaked revealing just that fictional encounter. Certainly not the first nor the worst type of creative license.Surprisingly, aspects of Hunt's personality are actually toned down. By all accounts, his sexual appetite was more of a compulsion, and his hard drug use and alcohol consumption more than recreational. He was renowned for enjoying all these to excess, even before having to nurse the pain of a broken marriage. His temper was described by Sir Sterling Moss as "volatile", with Hunt punching many a poor marshal who eagerly rushed to help Hunt after a shunt ? an oft repeated rhyme for this was a regular occurrence throughout his career. Instead, Ron Howard relies yet again on re-imagining another encounter - his version of Hunt's aggression slightly more noble.Despite these, Hemsworth's Hunt is still pretty much like the real Hunt, from the pre-race nerves, the vomiting, right down to the witty, politically incorrect, off the cuff remarks. In all, the James Hunt of Rush is a highly sympathetic character, one with real fears and tangible feelings underneath his playboy persona.Daniel Bruhl's Lauda on the other hand, is on the verge of one-dimensionality. Throughout the film, the Lauda of Rush is too uptight, too much of a straight edge. While the real Niki Lauda's methodical and no-nonsense approach is renowned, Lauda is a respected figure then and now. His then wife, Marlene Lauda, said of the ever escalating competitiveness of F1 late in Niki's career, "All the drivers are so serious, it's no longer fun. Niki is the only one who likes to smile and be friendly with the other drivers" ? a far cry from his on-screen depiction of an insufferable pedant.Only the real Lauda's act of self-preservation truly hints of the film version's human side. A decision borne out of fear, Tyrrell driver Jody Scheckter, called the real Lauda's actions as true bravery. Lauda got out of his Ferrari, defied Il Commendatore, and did not make any excuses. He just could not finish that race and he owned up to that decision.My biggest complaint is that for a motor racing film, Rush shows very little racing, with any long sequence only occurring about an hour into the film. Instead, races are abbreviated as quick flashes of blurred landscape and overused shaky in-car/on-car camera footage ? likely added post-production. Devoid of wide angle shots and any form of continuity editing, it's hard not to call attention into the shakiness as a crutch to depict frantic excitement. With the availability of such stable cranes and booms mounted on various high speed chase cars (such as the ones seen during production!), I was hoping for Rush to break from the "action equals shaky camera" trend of Hollywood filmmaking. Show me real driving! Alas, we are treated to quick, jarring cuts. Inevitably, I could never quite tell where the hell they are in the iconic racetracks of F1's yesteryear, were it not for the captions. Save for Monaco (which only appears in Hunt's visualization) and Nurburgring, all the other racing sequences could have been shot in Brands Hatch for all I know.Nonetheless, even though shot in digital format (Arri Alexa and Canon C300) I must commend the colour grading. The temptation must have been there to make it look orange and blue, or perhaps excessively filtered, like oh so many disgusting instagram photos. Instead, there is a subtle warmth to the whole film, as though it were shot in 1970's film stock.Yet, I really only point out these minor annoyances of Rush's action driving sequences because I am such a big fan of Frankenheimer's Grand Prix (1966) ? still to this day my benchmark for any racing flick. There have been many car related movies, few have been about racing, and all have failed because they pandered to the lowest common denominator of automobile fans. Because despite these embellishments, glossed over details, and current action filmmaking clichés, Rush is a masterful work of storytelling. Foregoing long drawn out and realistic driving sequences, Rush's plot moves very fast indeed, all whilst largely staying true to the actual historical turn of events ? Frankenheimer's Grand Prix was a notoriously slow burn. Nonetheless, perhaps in homage to Grand Prix, Rush also utilizes track announcers, reporters, and print headlines to advance the exposition (As an aside, I am unsure whether Simon Taylor plays Murray Walker or is he playing himself?).If anything, the mere fact that there is a slick new racing movie out will leave motorsport fans and racers alike thankful. So used are these fans and racers to have their love, their passion, and their pastime being mangled and misrepresented, that anything close enough to the gritty realism of the sport is a very welcome and refreshing change indeed. For those of you who feared this will be Stallone's Driven, redux, then you need not worry. Go watch it! You won't be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An F1 Feast whether you like the sport or not</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I like my motor racing and was old enough to remember the Lauda / Hunt season of 1976 which captivated the sporting public. I was dubious about the epic battle coming to the silver screen and yet after watching it, concluded that I'd just seen the best motor racing film of all time.We have been in this territory before. Both Steve McQueen and Jack Lemmon have had a go and in recent years we've seen NASCAR as well. But none have come close in captivating the sense of romance, danger and sheer bravery of the two protagonists in question.So why does it work so well? For a start, watching Daniel Brühl as Nikki Lauda was like watching the great man himself. A dead ringer who portrays the great man impeccably and who is the very antithesis of Hunt, the flamboyant, heavy drinking womaniser and maverick. Hemsworth looks great - not a dead ringer for Hunt but good enough and his accent is perfect.Of course, anyone who knows their motor racing knows what happens in the end. But it is the journey that is taken, from Lord Hesketh privateering a young James Hunt in Formula Two where he first comes to race with his Austrian counterpart, to the 1976 F1 Season and the tragedy of that day at the Nurburgring.It would be easy to focus on the climax of the film with Hunt being the winner, after nearly losing the title with a double puncture. But it is Lauda who is quite rightly the hero. The crash, the horrendous rehabilitation, the shocking press conference, the fear at his return at Monza, and then retirement in the final race. To come back from those injuries in only 6 weeks and to come so close to another World Championship is testament to the bravery of the man who went on to become a racing legend.The film also pays a great tribute to Hunt, who whilst affectionately known as 'the Shunt', was far more than just the stereotypical playboy. By Lauda's own admission, Hunt was a highly skilled driver who was incredibly quick. He lived his life on the edge both professionally and privately. To lose the great man at the age of 45 from a heart attack was a tragedy in itself, especially as he had been sober for four years.Whether you like F1 or not is irrelevant. Rush is a brilliant true life story which is expertly crafted by Ron Howard. The race scenes are fantastically reproduced and the sound is epic. You are left under no illusion that these guys put their lives on the line every time they turned up at the track.Rush has been tipped for the Oscars and quite rightly so. You will not see a better acting performance than from Daniel Brühl and I hope that he receives the coveted golden statue as it will be well deserved.If you haven't seen the film give it a go. Its a fabulous story, has some truly comic moments at times (the broken down car scene is a belter!) but also drama, heartbreak and triumph. And it is the fastest two hours I've experienced at the movies for many years.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Funny, intelligent, thrilling and moving, 'Rush' is a terrific movie, not just for F1 fans</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For whatever reason, the sport of Formula One is one that hasn't been served incredibly well in the movies. Aside from Asif Kapadia's 'Senna', there haven't really been any shining standouts. Thankfully, 'Rush' the latest movie from Ron Howard (reteaming with his 'Frost/Nixon' screenwriter Peter Morgan) is excellent, managing to make someone with no knowledge of the sport (i.e. this writer) compelled during the race sequences and throughout the entire championship. The movie centres on the rivalry between two F1 racers during the 1970s ? the British playboy James Hunt and the disciplined Austrian Niki Lauda, played by Chris Hemswoth and Daniel Brühl respectively ? and particularly during the 1976 Championship. This chalk-and-cheese relationship is at the very heart of 'Rush', with the differences between the two painted broadly, but effective nonetheless. Hunt is a racing pop star ? with a legion of screaming fans and tendency to the go to a party after race. Lauda, on the other hand, is socially-inept and rigidly determined to win the championship, consequently being unafraid to speak his mind as he calls an extremely expensive Ferrari made for him, "a s***box". Hemsworth plays Hunt in a way similar to how he played Thor but still gives a good performance, while Brühl once again proves him to be a great actor, delivering a terrific and always engaging performance as Lauda. It wouldn't be a great surprise if he picks up some major acting nominations.The race scenes in 'Rush' are a sight to behold ? Howard uses every trick going to make them exciting and he succeeds. With the shadow of death looming over each race, they are simultaneously exhilarating and terrifying, particularly Nüburgring in Germany, as Lauda and Hunt dart furiously around an incredibly dangerous track in extremely stormy weather conditions. Aiding these sequences, are Anthony Dod Mantle's excellent cinematography, some roaring sound design and Hans Zimmer's score, which sounds unlike much of his recent work, wonderfully sounding like The Edge from U2 at times and at others like Ramin Djawadi's score for 'Game of Thrones'. 'Rush' is easily one of the best movies Ron Howard has directed in recent years, (it's a vast improvement on 'The Dilemma', that's for sure) and possibly one of his best films in general. You could level numerous complaints at the film, that many of the characters are thinly- drawn or that the script isn't up to the standard of 'Frost/Nixon', but when said movie is emotionally engaging with heart-pounding races, such flaws don't even register. It may not break the mould, but 'Rush' is funny, intelligent, thrilling and moving.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Superb Performances...Great Authenticity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am an F1 fanatic - I not only follow the current events, but also the background stories and history of the sport. Therefore I am fully aware of the dynamics of the sport throughout the decades, and the details of the Lauda and Hunt careers.As such this film was a must-see for me, in the hope that it gives justice to F1 as a film topic, and also to see how this fantastic story is told.The performances of Hemsworth and Bruhl are superb...without doubt the best thing about this film...both performances are Oscar-worthy. I had already heard acclaim for Bruhl as Lauda (and he was great), but for me Hemsworth as Hunt was surprising - he really nailed the accent and mannerisms.The second success of the film is its authenticity. Clearly a lot of effort has been made to get the details of the era - the cars, the sponsors, the fashion, the F1 facts, the characters. Without this authenticity, real F1 fans would hate this film, but I believe they will be satisfied.The look and sound of the F1 action is pretty good. Some of the CGI is not the best, particularly when used to make a car spin more dramatic that it perhaps was, but overall it does not ruin the film.The film is more about the characters of Lauda and Hunt, than the sporting action, and that's fine. If you want to see more about the racing events and actual footage, watch the season reviews. This film does not provide a detailed insight into what happens throughout the seasons, nor events beyond the main characters. There are some weaker aspects to the film: 1. The film feels fairly clunky, almost like a series of movie trailers stitched together...it does not flow from chapter to chapter. I think this is because the makers are trying to cover all points in 2 hours - character background, on-track action, news events, etc. Perhaps it would work better as a TV mini-series (episode 1: pre-F1 careers, episode 2: pre-1976 F1, episode 3: 1976 up to German GP, episode 4: 1976 and career climax). 2. The commentators are simply annoying. There is a continuous commentator narration around the race events, and also a poorly cast Stirling Moss character pops up at each race. These are supposed to provide an update on what is going on in the season, but it could have been done better - at least with variety. 3. There is a little poetic license. Non-F1 fans or even casual F1 fans probably will not notice, but if you know the details of the era, how F1 operates, and Lauda/Hunt as drivers, you will spot them. Obviously these are there to add to the drama, and in general they can be accepted.Documentaries aside, I believe this is the best motorport movie so far. Sure it is not full of action, but it's a drama...a character study. When the action does intervene, it is heart (and ear) pounding.F1 and motorsport films have been a challenging topic, and there are not many about, so I hope this will encourage more, because there are some equally fantastic stories to be told.</fullReview>

Both Chris Hemsworth and Daniel Bruhl gave performances that summarised the drivers personalities artfully, especially the later. However, the film's constant bombardment of tense race after tense race made it lose sight, it was slightly dreary.

The racing scenes are thrilling, and the personal dynamics in the pits and away from the track genuinely intriguing. Lauda's character is played by Daniel Brühl who is cunning, self-centered and perfectionist at first, but develops as the movie progresses and becomes the emotional center of the movie towards the end. Hunt's character is diametrically opposite to Lauda's and is well played by Chris Hemsworth. The racing sequences are realistic and keep you on the edge of your seat. The women in the movie don't play a significant role and are there just for the for the sake of it. I would genuinely recommend this film to anyone who loves the action genre just for the sake of the racing sequences.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A well crafted movie with fantastic acting!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie "Rush" is about the rivalry between two racers; James Hunt and Nikki Lauda. We get to see the story from both perspectives and get to know both racers better. But who will be the number one racer? Hunt or Lauda?So that was my little synopsis of the movie now let's talk about the directing, cinematographing and some other 'technical' stuff in this paragraph. Let's start with the directing. Ron Howard has directed the movie and he did a very good job at it. With Howard it's most of the time a hit or miss. Howard has made good movies like "A Beautiful mind" but also bad movies like "The Da Vinci Code" (eventhough it was based on something good) This time it was definitely a hit. He used some good camera movements and long takes. The long takes were not that often present. But I still think it deserves a mention. He did a good job at the racing sequences, but at times this was a bit to fast paced for my taste and you couldn't really see which was which. The cinematography was pretty good. It was way better than the last movie I saw, in fact, everything is better than that movie, but I wouldn't call the cinematography fantastic or Oscar-worthy. It was just really good. This was done by Anthony Dod Mantle. Let's continue with some visual aspects. The CGI and make-up. The CGI-crash of Lauda was really good. It was very convincing and very near to the real crash. This brings me to the make-up of Lauda his face after the crash. Wow. This was done fantastic. It was hard to watch, so hard that I even switched to the next tablat. But the amazing sound choice didn't make it less gross. The sound design was done very well. The editing of this too. The soundtrack was fantastic, but I wouldn't expect anything less of Hans Zimmer. The editing too was done good.The acting now. I will talk about the two protagonists James Hunt and Nikki Lauda. Lat's also talk about them in that order. Hunt was played by Chris Hemsworth. Hunt was a playboy and a complacent asshole. Hemsworht absolutely nailed the part. He was very convincing and on the plus side, he also looks very similar too the real James Hunt. He may sound like a very annoying character but no. He wasn't annoying at all. Thanks to the fantastic writing you care for him. We see that he has his own problems. His drinking problem, and how his playboy characteristic backfires. His counterpart and also protagonist is Lauda played by Daniel Brühl. He was way better than Hemsworht in the role. Brühls accent was really convincing and I thought that he really came from there his acting may have looked stiff, but that's where they were going for. This fitted the character of Lauda perfectly. Brühl was cast perfectly. His appearance wasn't as close to his real counterpart as Hemsworth was, but the fantastic acting weighs up. Lauda is a smart man who uses his intelligence to beat Hunt in comprising to Hunt who doesn't think about his actions and just does them. This brings forward some very good dialogue.With that last sentence I will go over to the last 'Big' paragraph of my review. The script will be discussed in this part. Peter Morgan was responsible for this. And credit to him, because he did a fantastic job at it, in case you didn't notice from my last paragraph. The dialogue overall was good, but the dialogue between Lauda and Hunt was really good. The chemistry and friction between them made this only better, but this was of course thanks to the amazing acting capabilities of both actors. The way the story was told was also very good. It was a good choice to switch between both perspectives and show both characters imperfections. Doing this they made the characters more real. All of the characters were also well developed due to this. And thanks to all of these things combined you get sucked into the story and get invested into it. The film overall was very thrilling, surprisingly this was thanks to the directing but also editing the score and actually everything combined. But it is much more than just a sport film. It's a gripping movie with a meaning and fantastic characters. The movie makes you care about them and understand their actions. But as I've said: It's much more than that. Due to the things I've just said in the previous paragraph I will definitely recommend this movie to anyone! Even if they are not interested in F1, just like me, because the movie will pull you in and make you interested. The movie is also overall well crafted, as said in my title. That's why this movie get's an 9.25/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am so impressed with this movie. The trailer doesn't do it justice and I initially thought it would be a mediocre movie at best. I wasn't expecting the story to be so much deeper than two arrogant men just racing formula one cars. Their story was actually very captivating and they both have the spirit to make them unforgettable.It truly is a terrible experience but honestly I'm sure it happens all the time. And to keep putting yourself into harms way is either a very brave thing to do or incredibly stupid. Another surprise to me was Chris Hemsworth's acting. I knew he wasn't a bad actor but I didn't know he was a good actor. The cast are well suited to their roles and they really immerse themselves in their characters.Overall it was a great movie with a really good story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Chris Hemsworth, playing playboy British 1970s Formula One driver James Hunt, is the poster boy for this film and sure, he is charismatic and really takes his role well. But the real star is Daniel Bruhl, who has the meatiest role as the forthright, stubborn, super-confident, ultra cool rival Austrian driver Niki Lauda. Director Ron Howard has a tough task, balancing the need to satisfy motor sport fans' need to see all that sweaty racing up on the big screen. But Howard also tries to portray real life events and people in a faithful and meaningful way, while keeping the scenes coming at a cracking pace. And he does a great job. The script is excellent. Apparently the writer dined with Lauda 30 times, and won his trust, and so the movie is filled with little details that make the characters seem human, as opposed to the two dimension, superhuman idols they could have been. It's really interesting to realise that Hunt and Lauda both rebelled against their families, and both had an almost insane desire to win. And the film also explores, very well, the extent to which both of them were willing to ignore the normal warning signs of extreme danger to their lives in exchange for fame and fortune. Hunt did it in driving in extremely wet conditions in the Japanese Grand Prix, and Lauda did it in the German track where he crashes and almost dies, and then, during his comeback, when he ignores the pain from his burn scars to get back into racing again. But as the film makes very obvious, to drive Formula One in the 1970s was very much to risk death. Everyone accepted it, and on any given day, either your number might come up and you die, or you win the race and get international praise and a big payment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not a Formula 1 fan, but I really liked this movie. It's about cars and races, but that's not the main topic of Rush, it's more about the rivalry of 2 drivers Niki Lauda and James Hunt. The actors and their personalities are great and the fact that this was a true story, really makes this movie awesome. The atmosphere of the 70's contributes to the charm of this movie, the cars, the people, the clothes :) and the actors are almost identical to the real persons. Rush not only gives you a lot of adrenaline during intense races but it also incites a lot emotions for both characters. I strongly recommend it even if don't like cars or races, simply because of the story . I must admit that in the end, I really started to become more interested in F1.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes, an entertaining piece of film by R. Howard. For a historic racing junkie like me it's a must to see movies like these when they comes up. The romance about the '76 season is the story that has been spoken about over and over and over again in almost 40 years. The hard contrast between these two drivers in the movie - well playing actors, by the way - seems to me being a little "over the top" to make it more thrilling on film. I've read hundreds of books and other autobiography's about 1970's formula 1, and here it seems like the script-makers had some free hands to get some more edge on the story; a k a "Hollywood Frosting". Obviously, two drivers driving for such hard competing teams can't be seen on the pub sharing a cage of beer after the races, but I think they (Lauda and Hunt) had more respect for one another than the movie partly shows. Enough about that. Otherwise good elicited racing cars from mid-70's. Some JPS Lotus 77's and Tyrrell P34's to sparkle the screen, as well as the "main events" McLaren M23 and the Ferrari 312T. But, as a finish, why did they totally jump over Lauda's freshmen year along with the March team in 1972? A few minutes artificial footage would not been a suffer to the movie, it would have rather enriched it. Fun movie with some flaws; It's not worth it's average ranking.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ron Howard offers us an utterly satisfying and rigorously made movie. This is one of the best drama movies based on a true story, in which you can completely connect with the drivers' milieu. Chris Hemsworth and Daniel Bruhl's actor traits suit perfectly to the James Hunt and Niki Lauda's ones respectively. This is a touching story about one of the most fierce racing rivalries of all time, It's a story about the bond between life and death. It is a relentless, yet heartbreaking battle between two of the best F1 drivers, who actually can't live without each other on and off the track. They are each other's friend and foe. One is nothing without the other.Part of the Howard's movie is slow-paced, filled with verbal fireworks, yet the other part is a FormulaOne-fast-scenario. An enthralling movie, undoubtedly deserving an Oscar not only for best Picture but also for best Actor. We can see one of the most compelling performances of 2013, here, in Rush.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ron Howard's Thrill-Ride will Give You an Adrenaline 'Rush'!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's been a lot of hype surrounding director Ron Howard's last venture into the world of Formula One racing starring Chris Hemsworth and Daniel Brühl. It's safe to report that 'Rush' is a thrill ride that will leave you entertained from moment one.Rush tells the true story of a single season of Formula One racing in 1976 featuring the intense rivalry between playboy superstar James Hunt (Hemsworth) and science-focused misanthrope Niki Lauda (Brühl). The film progresses as the two work pit their dichotomy of passions for racing against one another on a world stage that eventually leads to Lauda's near-fatal accident and subsequent return to the competition. It's the battle of the Formula One alpha males as the real-life rivalry between the hard-nosed Austrian and the British playboy is given full, glorious vent in Ron Howard's exciting car-race movie.While Howard follows both men's romantic lives, the focus is really on the love-hate relationship between two bitter adversaries who can't help admiring each other. And what a relationship! It's a duel of dualism, with audiences leaning into the corners to decide whether to ally themselves with Hunt's hedonism or Lauda's hard-headedness. Howard's triumph is that the choice is never an easy one. Howard has a way of wringing human tension from a story even if you have no great interest in or knowledge of the setting. Apollo 13 was set in space; Cinderella Man was (and yet wasn't) about boxing; and Rush mines the noisy, gasoline-and-testosterone world of the Formula 1 circuit in ways that even non-gearheads can get their heads around. As well as brandishing his usual mastery for pacing gutsy dramas, Howard's command over his division of digital artists results in some great sequences once the action moves to the track ? the recreation of Lauda's fatal crash is stunning! What helps the film move along, are the impressive turns by the two leads. Chris Hemsworth is very convincing as the flaky, womanizing Brit who puts fun before everything else. Fascinating and layered deep with a silence under the glitz and glamor, James Hunt was a lonely person. Hemsworth illustrates all of it with a light sensitivity and a charismatic nature. Daniel Brühl fully understands the mechanics and precise ways of Niki Lauda. Serious to a fault, his Lauda is a study in straight talk, calculated risk taking and common sense, qualities that often put him at odds with everybody else. Bruhl gives his character soul with the occasional smile and showing of vulnerability.When seen on the big screen, Rush is an absolute thrill-ride. When the lights went down, my heart-rate was inexorably starting to climb. After about half an hour I was having difficulty breathing. I wasn't the only one. The whole row I was in sounded like an outing of emphysema patients!</fullReview>

I admire James Hunt(Chris Hemsworth) as well, because of his sporting spirits and attitudes toward life.As far as I am concerned, this movie is an excellent one after I review all the racers' personal story on the wikipedia. It is really a good story reteller.But if you concentrate on the film itself, the shooting might be a little boring, because there does not exist any foreshadowing in this story. The movie is just telling, without any artificial decoration. So I could find out the ending even if I am just watching it for about one hour.As for movie like To the Fore and Unbeatable acted by Eddie Peng, each of them have different advantages.

		<shortDescription>Intense Rivalry on the Racetrack</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie about the intense rivalry and hostility between car racing champs Niki Lauda (Daniel Bruhl) and James Hunt (Chris Hemsworth) has the feel of a movie and documentary. The two personalities are a contrast between the disciplined, serious Lauda and the partying, fun-loving Hunt. The film-making was spectacular as it showed the view behind the wheel as cars race at terrifying speed. In one event, won by a Hunt, Lauda literally crashed and burned, resulting in serious lung damage and permanent scarring. (Lauda opposed holding the event because of the poor race conditions but entered against his better judgement.) Later, he returned to show his unyielding drive as he continued to compete and win. Both became world champions and beat one another in fiercely contested races. What stays with the viewer is the image of two highly driven young men whose rivalry brings out the best in each other as they mature and come to respect one another. They are not only great racing drivers but become men of character. Once again, director Ron Howard has created a movie that speaks to the heart with this great addition to his many directing achievements.</fullReview>

Now make the sport bike movie to honor racers like me; the unsung hero's of American highways.

		<fullReview>Rush is a movie about two Formula 1 drivers and their rivalry. Story wise, as it is a biography, it is quite interesting and entertaining, even though everything could have gone wrong with a movie about racing. Fortunatelly the driving scenes are not the main core of the film and that makes the movie interesting to audiences other than formula 1 fans. Next stop the performances. The two main stars are making a good work with their characters, especially as the film gets to the accident, when the characters must overcome their superficial status that they had for the first part of the movie and focus on the emotions and how deep actually their rivalry goes. For those who know the story there won't be any surprises, but for those who don't, the plot is gripping enough. So 7 out of 10.</fullReview>

However, some of the details seem very Hollywoody, ie made up for dramatic effect. Plus, in adding in some poetic licences, you also feel that more important true details have been left out. Then again, director Ron Howard has always been more about box office takings than art, more about drama than fact.Good performances from Chris Hemsworth and Daniel Bruhl in the lead roles. Good support from a cast which includes Olivia Wilde and Natalie Dormer.Very entertaining, but don't expect to come away knowing all the (true) facts about the James Hunt-Niki Lauda rivalry.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>RUSH (one of the best masterpiece &amp; one of my all time valued experience) They say "a wise man can learn more from his enemy than a fool from his friends". This movie is a "motion" example of this true fact. Very often a movie got so rightly made which leaves a lasting impression on a viewer, but this is something else, it gives you goosebumps &amp; inspires you throughout. Based on true rivalry of James Hunt &amp; Niki Lauda, both the champions of Formula 1 in late 70's, the movie deals with not only the glam part of this sport, but also gives a really deep insight. It shows us how blessed a someone can be who has a good rival, who can indeed become each other's inspiration. Having very different ideologies, both James Hunt &amp; Niki Lauda compete each other right from the beginning of their careers in Formula 3 till the end in Formula 1. Chris Hemsworth playing James Hunt is all true to his character, what a racer thought-out to be; bold, risk-taker, casanova, full of life. But, the real surprise is from his methodical, brilliant opponent, Austrian driver Niki Lauda played by Daniel Bruhl, who not only justifies Lauda's depth but also fulfills a promising act. The story follows their distinctly different personal styles on and off the track, their loves and the astonishing 1976 season in which both drivers were willing to risk everything to become world champion. It's a matter of fact, that only a handful of movies can achieve a perfect mastery of art from all this departments; cinematography, acting, background scores, editing, screenplay directing all just bestowed perfectly. Tightly directed by Ron Howard, perfectly written &amp; crisply edited, Rush is an exhilarating ride. Ron Howard who is master in taking different genres through-out his career, deliver his second best after 'A Beautiful Mind', the term which suits him. Hans Zimmer's back scores engages us as always. A notable mention is for the director of photography, Anthony Dod Mantle, who shot all the racing sequences with a thrilling frame, the film has a beautifully crafted close-ups &amp; keen details. Kudos to the digital intermediate colorist even, who gave us a real feel of the 70's &amp; formula racing. The movie just not falls into a another sports film category because it has much more to deal with. It deals with the philosophy on life of both the competitors, the formula sport pros and cons &amp; the undying spirit. The more I speak about this movie, makes me watch it again. I, hardly remember the number of times I watched (or can say experienced) this since last year. Always will be regretful of missing it on the silver screen. Nevertheless, it's perfect, full of spirit &amp; is all filled with gems.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Rush (2013): Dir: Ron Howard / Cast: Chris Hemsworth, Daniel Bruhl, Olivia Wilde, Alexandra Maria Lara, Pierfrancesco Favino: Electrifying action sports drama about that adrenalin rush when faced with stern competition. True story of the battle between two Formula One drivers. Chris Hemsworth plays English playboy James Hunt who boozes and hooks up with several women. Daniel Bruhl plays the focused Austrian driver Niki Lauda who is appalled by the actions of Hunt. Set mainly in 1976 with Ron Howard creating exciting racing action as well as tension when weather creates a major crash. One narrative element that isn't examined to its fullest is the married lives of the two driver. Both drivers react differently to this. Hemsworth creates the flamboyant competitive personality of Hunt while Bruhl is equally great as Lauda who survives a nasty crash that leaves him scarred. One big flaw is that Olivia Wilde, as Hunt's wife who leaves him for Richard Burton, and Alexandra Maria Lara as Lauda's loyal wife seem like an after thought and are too much in the distant background. Pierfrancesco Favino plays another racer named Clay Regazzoni from Switzerland, who died a few years prior to this film's release. This is not a film about Formula One. It regards a rivalry so fierce that the two factors can do no more than nod and respect each other. Ron Howard began his directing career with an inferior race car comedy called Grand Theft Auto. Here he raises the rod with intense focus as two champions pit against each other in a struggle for fame, triumph and hopefully dignity. Score: 8 / 10</fullReview>

Filled with amazing visuals, spicy story lines and superb castings, Rush has well and truly solidified it's position in the entertainment world. Most fans of Hemsworth will recognize him from Marvel's Thor franchise but what they won't be able to recognize is his love and passion for the racing industry.

		<shortDescription>Completely unexpectedly good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to admit I watched this film for reasons that had nothing to do with it, it was a completely random choice. I even looked it up first just to see what it is about before I started watching it and was kind of put off by being a sports movie about car racers. I have to also admit that I think the sport itself quite silly, even amongst other silly sports. But the film was so good that I had to rate it top grade.The story is a classic conflict between the clear headed unpleasant man racing cars for money and the maverick charismatic risk taker that does it for the kicks, but unlike most American movies, it does not turn one into a hero and the other into a villain. Instead it presents the world of racing as it was back then: high risk of injury and death, the glory and the pain, the races that are not cancelled if people paid too much for viewing rights no matter the risks, the gladiatorial adrenaline filled world of the racers themselves.But what was better than great acting, great directing and a wonderful story was the refreshing perspective from actual people with actual lives and problems and emotions. It was so personal and so touching that I believed it to be Lauda's own biography and searching for it I see that he actually published one, called To Hell and Back, yet the script is not based on that, but on the work Peter Morgan did with constant input from Lauda. Daniel Bruhl's extraordinary performance was also honed by him spending time with Niki Lauda.Not everybody is happy with the film, though. Some think that the film pales in comparison to John Frankenheimer's Grand Prix, a movie that I have no watched. It might make a good viewing if you like this one.All in all, I really appreciate the effort done in researching and planning the film as well as the wonderful performances and directing. Carjack TV videos show Lauda and Hemsworth and Daniel Bruhl interviews of the film which might come nicely after watching the movie. Great job all around!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Based on a true story.Rush is a biographical sports drama based on the lives of Formula 1 drivers and fierce rivals Niki Lauda and James Hunt. The film covers their early lives and forays into motor sport but its primary focus is the 1976 Formula 1 season when Lauda is the defending champion and Hunt, his closest challenger to the crown. What follows leaves both of them scarred forever. Lauda wins most of the Grand Prix(s) in the first half of the season leaving him in a seemingly unbeatable position in the table. Then came the Nurnburgring Grand Prix in West Germany. There were concerns about the safety of the track but the race still went on which resulted in Lauda's vehicle catching fire after sustaining a rear suspension failure. Lauda sustains severe burns and is rushed to the hospital, fighting for his life. James Hunt meanwhile manages to cover ground on the now recovering Lauda, much to the latter's frustration. Lauda returns to the circuit after just 6 weeks out but his efforts go in vain as Hunt is crowned champion.Niki Lauda is played to near perfection by the diminutive but charismatic Daniel Bruhl. There is an astounding similarity in their resemblances and actions which Lauda himself had admitted while giving the go ahead to the movie. Chris Hemsworth does an amazing job of playing the cheeky James Hunt as well.This complete package will absolutely blow your mind!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>'Rush' is a solid film with two brilliant performances from Hemsworth and Lauda.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's no doubt that Ron Howard can make great films. His movies have won numerous awards and have starred some of the biggest names in the business at one point or another. That said, with only a few exceptions such as 'Apollo 13&#x2032; or 'Parenthood', most of his movies tend to be forgettable after the first year or so and begin to collect dust in people's movie collections. Unfortunately, that's also the case with 'Rush'. People may love it at first, but I doubt that anybody will mention it next year.Much like Howard's first film as director, 1977's 'Grand Theft Auto', 'Rush' is a race car movie. However, instead of focusing on the races, this one hones in on the two main characters and their transformations at the height of their careers.The film tells the true story of the rivalry between Formula One champions James Hunt (Chris Hemsworth) and Niki Lauda (Daniel Bruhl) in the 1970s. The incredibly handsome Hunt leads a playboy lifestyle and is not above drinking, doing drugs or having sex with multiple women right before a big race. He takes dangerous risks and is a superb driver, which leads him to win quite a bit. On the other hand, Lauda comes from a very wealthy Austrian family that has disowned him for going into racing. He's the complete opposite of Hunt, and is only concerned with winning and working 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. He has no time for friends, love or parties.Naturally, these two collide in more than one way and actively dislike one another. However, each respects the other's amazing skill in driving. After several races, Lauda is severely injured in a crash on the track and receives major burns to his leg and face, after which Hunt indirectly helps him return to racing in under two months.Howard's camera follows these two daredevils through their successes and failures. We forge bonds and gain respect for both, even despite their faults. Bruhl is phenomenal as Lauda. People used to call the real Lauda a rat because he had bucked teeth and mousy face, and acted like a rude prick most of the time. Nevertheless, when Lauda recovers in the hospital, Bruhl gives an exceptional performance. As the doctors vacuum out his lungs with a long pole, or when Lauda tries to put his helmet on over his newly burned face, the actor makes us feel the character's pain.Of course, Hemsworth is the Thor-like god we expect him to be. He's deeply charismatic, funny and devastatingly handsome, but there's real pain behind all the charm and beauty when his widely publicized marriage doesn't work out and his friends turn on him. One of my favorite scenes comes when Hunt brutally and deservedly attacks a member of the press for asking Lauda how his wife can look at his ugly face now that he's burned.'Rush' is a solid film with two brilliant performances from Hemsworth and Lauda. It's worth the price of a movie tick and I expect decent returns at the box office, but it rarely feels fresh and the racing scenes aren't particularly suspenseful.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Excellently portrayed true story of James Hunt and Niki Lauda! Ron Howard's directing was superb by capturing real emotion on the F1 circuit! Hemsworth and Bruhl are fantastic!! Both actors really did a great job and it was like really watching the F1 legends rivalry take shape. The support actors really did a great job, especially Lauda's wife. The true story of this "rivalry" is actually very compelling. I watched HUNT VS LAUDA doc and it was great, but RUSH was story we wanted and didn't disappoint! The whole movie felt like you were given the inside scoop that nobody else really knew about other than the race drivers race car driving.. It was as if you were riding shotgun to back story and to the speed of the race cars.</fullReview>

But this movie is well worth the watch. 2 hours seem short with this movie,the story is really well made. Even if you don't really like racing this will give you a whole new perspective of the racing world. Watch this.. Even with your children. Not too young of course, but it is such an exiting story it will be well worth it!! I told all my friends about this movie, because it is not a well known one. To me it could have been one of the best and biggest movies ever made. Should have gotten multiple Oscars. Not only for the acting, but also for the story being told.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm Austrian.Watching Austrian Television I saw Niki Lauda more often in Television then Michael Schuhmacher and David Hasselhoff combined.I have heard the story. Still I never understood why we considered him a hero just for having won some races and wasting his face while doing so. Now I know. If this would not have been a real story, I would have considered it "too much". Too much pathos. Too many coincidences. Too much everything. I would have considered the actions of the actors to be irrational. Claim, nobody would act like them in real life. But so they did. And for this, they really are heroes. Great movie, with excellent pictures and Hans Zimmer Soundtrack (no superlative needed). Direction was great, and even though the story was exaggerated at points and even though I was aware of that, it didn't matter.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had heard very good things about this film; however, I was never really sure why people thought it was so great. I always thought it was "just another racing movie," and didn't really have much to it. But I was surprisingly wrong, and I'm very glad.Since this is a racing movie though, I thought the action and the cinematography put into it was great. The different angles that were used to get certain shots were perfect, and it seemed to put you right in the car with them. On top of that, both Hemsworth and Bruhl put on great performances. Bruhl is the typical know-it-all who is full of money and schemes, and Hemsworth is the pretty boy who pulls all the chicks and just happens to be good at what he does. When these two clash, the rivalry is perfect.My favorite part of the movie is how it is setup. Let me explain what I mean. Who is the protagonist? Who is the antagonist? They both had reasons to be either one, but there was still never a clear answer. It's different. It's genius. It's brilliant.8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The most impressive thing Rush did for me was actually that I liked it. No I didn't. I loved this movie. I'm saying that it's impressive, because I have absolutely no interest whatsoever in F1 Racing. What did it for me in this film were the amazing characters. Polarized til' the death, Nicki Lauda and James Hurt's rivalry in this movie is amazingly well portrayed with amazing (and shocking) performances by Chris Hemsworth and Daniel Brühl. The script is amazing and I really have no complaints about the movie, whatsoever. What really intrigued me about the movie and kept me on the edge of my seat was basically that I knew nothing about the real story behind the film and because it is so well written, acted and shot I just needed to keep watching. The film features some of the best footage of cars and engines and racing that I have ever seen. The rivalry between Lauda and Hurt is compelling to say the least and it is extremely interesting to watch these two opposite people in every way compete to be the best, but in a way they still motivate each other. Kinda like Batman and Joker...kinda...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I originally didn't know anything about the source material going in to this movie. I didn't know James Hunt or Niki Lauda so I went into this film with an open mind. Needless to say I was completely blown away by the smart, funny and amazing script-work from Peter Morgan. This film has instances where you are gripping the edge of your seat while the leads are racing in a physical and metaphorical battle with each others personalities. This is also a film that has two amazing performances from superhero Chris Hemsworth and Daniel Bruhl. Both give convincing and memorable performances that makes the film much more interesting than other actors could do. I have to say that Bruhl gave the best performance of the film because you relate to his push to be the best and his bluntness to all his instructions to his team.The other performances from Olivia Wilde, Julian Rhind-Tutt and Natalie Dormer are all short but memorable. Overall I can not recommend this film enough. If you get the chance see this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An interesting story wins out over average film-making</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>RUSH is a film which tells the true-life tale of the rivalry between F1 drivers Niki Lauda and James Hunt during the 1970s. It's a film which explores what makes the two men tick in terms of their personal lives, but it also looks at the world of racing back in the 1970s, which was definitely a more dangerous time to be a racing driver.The film begins quite slowly, with lots of extraneous sex scenes that director Ron Howard seems to enjoy slipping in for no real reason other than to titillate the audience. I'm not really a big fan of Howard as director and he's quite lazy here, repetitively using songs on the soundtrack to evoke the emotion of his leading characters when better writing in the script would have helped.Stick with it though, because after the first hour this starts to get much more interesting. A sense of suspense and impending doom hangs over the whole production and you begin to get invested in the leading characters. Both Chris Hemsworth and Daniel Bruhl are good as the leads, with the latter putting in a particularly effective performance as a man whose desire to win leads to some tragic circumstances. RUSH is rounded out by a solid supporting cast and some excellently staged racing scenes which lift it above its average beginnings.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gripping F1 drama based on real life rivalry</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can't recall having watched many dramas or movies about Formula 1 and this actually surprised me with it's depth of story line and intense character rivalry based on a true story. James Hunt and Niki Lauda were polar opposites - Hunt British Formula 1's reckless playboy of the time and Lauda the methodical, determined and arrogant Austrian. Hemsworth and Bruhl delivered outstanding performances to give so much depth to the fierce rivalry that drove one another to ultimately becoming world champions. Although there are major differences we also see a singular similarity in both characters of the unnerving belief that they will be world champion. This is something that bonds them - even if they would never be friends there is an underlying respect beneath the banter. Bruhl in particular was fantastic - especially after the major accident. His performance shows how obsessive such rivalry in sport can make a person become. And he also shows how a near death experience can make a person more aware of the life around him he could have lost. Cue the repeated shots of his wife played by Alexandra Maria Lara(who outside of the main two I thought was absolutely superb in a supporting role). Lauda realised at that point he had achieved what he had wanted to achieve and nearly paid the ultimate price in trying to achieve it again. He decided he had nothing left to prove and only everything to potentially lose and left the ball in Hunt's court. Hunt delivered and achieved his ultimate goal - something that he only had to experience once to prove to himself that he could do it. The party lifestyle never stopped and sadly he was lost to the world at only 45. Rivalry can push others to go further than they ever would have. But it can also be dangerous. This drama recognises both of these factors. It can also leave a lifelong respect between those who experienced it and when it's over leave a gap that can never be filled. For me the viewer - I was left with a lasting respect for the rivalry of two polar opposite champions - who never tried to change themselves or the way they operated. Who had true inner belief that one day they would be world champions. And although it can be deemed as reckless - who had the courage to lay it all on the line and risk everything to achieve their goals.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Outstanding and an equal to Grand Prix</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>During my teens and early adulthood I followed the Gran Prix Formula One racing scene as the best race car drivers in the world raced on that circuit. I was a Jim Clark fan and I thought he was the best driver during his time. A Formula 1 champion, Clark was also an Indy 500 winner and his death was significant in that the world had lost another great driver of a time much different than today.In the movie RUSH, set in 1976, Clark had been dead from a crash for over seven years, a stretch of time that I could tell you who won which race, where the races in Formula 1 were staged, and who had the best and fastest cars. As mentioned in Ron Howard's RUSH (2013), at the beginning race of the 1976 season, of the 25 drivers to start that first race, two would be killed by the end of season. That was normal for F 1. Driving a F 1 car was as dangerous a job you could have, ranking up there with being an astronaut. Like riding on a bomb waiting to exploded as referred to in the movie, it took a special man to guide the bomb down the track, turn after turn, all in accordance with a precise skill of hand, eye, and foot coordination. Jim Clark was just one of the great drivers not to live to an old age, and like the others that raced in Formula 1, the thought of death was always present, like being a soldier in a war that was asked to lead the charge. John Frankenheimer directed Grand Prix (MGM 1966) and it was, at the time, the most exciting movie I had ever viewed. Attending a screening here in OKC, the wide screen production was an event of historical significance worldwide. In a future viewing forty-five years later from that first look, Grand Prix presents itself as a fully encapsulated microcosmic look of the time and period of 1965 Formula 1 racing spectacle and pageantry. With appearances of many of the F 1 drivers of the era, along with real race footage interwoven with make believe shots, Grand Prix holds the test of time, providing a film still fresh and beautiful as the day it opened in the theaters almost a half a century ago. Not as personal a movie as RUSH, the epic Grand Prix is still the greatest film on auto racing ever made, and also the most visually handsome of any. It puts you in the seat of an F 1 car and never relents in the spine tingling exhilaration of power of the experience mixing with the terror of a sudden catastrophe. RUSH, on the other had, gets into the soul of two men in their pursuit of greatness in F 1 and their drive to better the other. The better acted movie, RUSH gives its' two protagonists enough differences to try to make you pick one over the other, yet allowing both to have good and not go good attributes in the way they live their lives. Ron Howard is as fine a director as Frankenheimer, but RUSH lacks in the racing scenes where Grand Prix excels. Real footage always, well usually, bests make believe, and in this comparison, RUSH comes in second place. One significant difference that gives RUSH a positive advantage over Grand Prix is the finality of the accident. Not that the accidents shown in RUSH are better shot or more exciting, the gory frames that you are required to view are horrific in nature, realistic to the point of nausea. A driver's body, minus his head, sitting in a wrecked F 1 race car; a driver burning in race car while trying to free himself; and another driver being loaded into a meat wagon with injuries that you really don't want to look at. I will give Ron Howard credit that he didn't prolong the savagery, cutting away in enough time to allow the viewer get away from such nastiness, but leaving a lot to ponder in the future. I liked RUSH very much. A movie I will see again in a couple of years, to enjoy the acting skills of the various "faces" of the beautiful people, including Chris Hemsworth as James Hunt, Daniel Bruhl as Niki Lauda, Olivia Wilde as Suzy Miller and Alexandra Maria Lara as Marlene Lauda. Director Howard tries to get us into the head of the Hunt and Lauda, how they tick, how they as race car drivers, take the sport as individuals who were on different time clocks. Fascinating work by Howard and outstanding performances by Hemsworth and Bruhl. As for Garner and the rest of the cast of Grand Prix, routine and workmanlike performances, yet putting those actors into real race cars and having them in truth, drive the F 1 race tracks, you cannot take away from their bravery. The race car genre in movies is littered with some good, some not so good, and some really bad. In my book, there is noting worse than a bad race car movie. Both Grand Prix and RUSH are outstanding and very good, respectfully. Two movies on the same track ten years apart, but in reality, not one second apart in taking the checked flag.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrific movie dramatises a compelling sporting rivalry</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Rush' tells the story of the dramatic and at times tumultuous rivalry between Formula One motor racing drivers James Hunt and Niki Lauda during the 1970s, culminating in the remarkable 1976 season.Motor racing films are notoriously difficult to gain mainstream attention and success, yet 'Rush' achieves this better than most, finding an excellent blend between the on-track action and the personal drama between both protagonists.Told primarily from Lauda's perspective, the film encapsulates the nature of an elite sporting duel pitting the playboy, arrogant and cocksure Hunt against the cold and calculating Lauda. Both are chalk and cheese yet the relationship on screen demonstrates the symbiotic link between them. The narrative surrounding both drivers' journey to their 1976 face-off is cleverly juxtaposed: Hunt and Lauda are diametrically opposed characters yet both possess stupendously large egos that make neither particularly likable.The film's centrepiece is Lauda's horrific accident at the Nurburgring in the 1976 German Grand Prix, which he barely survives, and his subsequent battle to return to compete for the Championship he is defending. The recreation of the real-life accident - and other racing scenes in the movie - is supremely done with the colours, speed and sound of the cars beautifully realised by Director Ron Howard. The track action is expertly contrasted with the grim hospital scenes where a recuperating Lauda has the last rites read, his lungs pumped and his burned skin repeatedly bandaged. The culmination of the film is the final race of the 1976 season with both drivers risking everything in the torrential rain of Japan. For anyone not knowing the story, the denouement has the potential to be both surprising and a little underwhelming albeit completely in keeping with the logical progression of both characters.'Rush' is a powerful and entertaining recreation of a true story that defined Formula One for years and, in many ways, defied fiction, such was its stupendous journey and finale. Inevitable comparisons can be made with the magnificent 'Senna' documentary film and just like it, 'Rush' provides a story that will appeal to motor racing enthusiasts and the uninitiated in equal measures.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Rush" is worth watching</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Rush" is another cinematic success for its director, Ron Howard. It is a 2013 film written by Peter Morgan and is currently available on NetFlix Instant Download Streaming. The film is just over 2 hours long, but when it was over it seemed like I had been in the cinema about 30 minutes. The film centers on the battle for the 1976 Formula 1 World Championship, and the rivalry between the Austrian "professor" Nikki Lauda and the British playboy James Hunt. The two are depicted as enemies, but in actual fact they were good friends who trusted and respected each other on, as well as off- track. This bit of artistic license does not spoil the film and is reasonable in order to make the battle between the two for the F1 crown more intense. The film is nicely paced. We are introduced to both characters through their own narrative and scenes that leave the watcher in no doubt as to their background and philosophy on life. The two are first seen in competition in 1970 at a Formula 3 race at Crystal Palace (where they have a coming together) and sets the scene for the rivalry throughout the film. I'm not sure if this is further artistic license. The two definitely did race each other in F3, but I am not convinced as to whether this actual incident occurred. After that we are given a whistle stop journey between 1973 (when Hunt came into F1) to 1975. We are shown the dangerous nature of F1 at the time with the Francois Cevert accident at Watkins Glen in gory detail ? although this does not seem like gratuitous, but necessary to bring home just how unforgiving the sport was back then ? and it truly was (of the top 12 points scorers in 1976, F1 cars were to claim 3, 1 ended up in a wheelchair and 1 had his career ended by a leg crunching crash). I gave it 9 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The epitome of rivalry</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Since seeing Backdraft in 1991, I've been waiting for Ron Howard to return to something a bit more gritty. And with this film, he found just the right balance. Rush deftly captures the essence of rivalry. It also depicts an accurate look at the 1970s. I can relate to both since I was there in the 1970s and I've been through the intense rivalry that comes with steep competition with a group of adept people that face possible elimination. Without even trying, it's all too easy to be identified as someone's enemy. It's only when it's all over and done that you realize that your enemy wanted to be your friend.Right from the get-go, the cinematography and audio mix hit you. That was my first indication that this was a high-quality film. Then, after a while, it becomes apparent that the characters are really strong. There's a definite sense of authenticity to this film and the later races really get the blood going. I actually worried about the drivers and was 'hanging on the edge of my seat' as the old expression goes. Be sure to check this film out -- even if you're not really a fan of racing. It's also worthwhile to take a look at the documentary that accompanies it. Cheers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A reckless, feckless playboy pits his wits against a methodical, rat-faced rival in the deadly world of F1 in the 1970s. There are so many ways this film could have faltered into B-movie and/or made-for-TV mediocrity. The premise outlined above practically screams such credentials. Peter Morgan and Ron Howard should take a bow for steering clear of obvious pitfalls and crafting something truly insightful and cathartic from this material. Like many admirers of this film, I have no interest in F1, and actually rather despise the sport as the plaything of airhead rich fools. This film works because it is a classic odd couple formula. It also has in-built drama from the life-and-death activity these men earn their crust from. Then there is that whiff of authenticity they garner from basing this on a true story. The actors inhabit their roles completely, and the sense of mutual loathing and respect is finely conveyed. The narration is slightly annoying, but bearable. Clever, insightful and engrossing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I liked Rush because of the way it is put together and the fact that it is based on a true story. As James Hunt progresses through the formula driving leagues, his rival Nikki Lauder bought his way into Ferrari. There are multiple arguments between Hunt and Lauder, as the season goes on there is a fight for the title between our two main characters. The turning point is when they are on a race day and the rain is pouring down, Lauder suggests to call of the race, Hunt comes in and notices that if they call of the race Lauder will win the championship. They go ahead with the race and Lauder has a crash, causing severe burns. While Lauder is out Hunt wins most races. In the end it is Hunt who wins the championship. I like the twist in the true story that it is not always a happy ending. Lauder is still alive to this day, but Hunt sadly passed away at the age of 45 due to a heart attack. So if you fancy watching a fast action film, I would definitely recommend this film and I rate this film an amazing 8/10.</fullReview>

Ron Howard has been involved in this sort of film since 1976's "Eat My Dust" (which is more enjoyable).Clearly there is something I am missing, but this has to rank up there with all those Indian movies for the most over-rated on IMDb.

		<fullReview>This movie is a nice watch, I would say a well directed movie showing the rivalry between two formula one champions. I did not know anything about the two prior to this movie but the movie gave me good insight. I enjoyed this movie but I felt the story was too simple as if evident what was going to happen. It felt like a commercial film. The conversations between the two should have been more insightful. The action scenes were really good. I did not get bored that is the best thing in this movie but definitely not a great movie. The movie could be said a bit clichéd. The music was not that good. Some of the scenes were not at all required. The most depressing thing for me was Natallie Dormer just appears for 5 minutes. But Nevertheless if you love action then this film ranks very high among the action flicks due to sheer direction because it is very difficult to make a movie on car racing that too for the period of 1970-76. So go for it if you love action</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Howards is one of the last director which cares about story telling. His last movie "Rush" shines the light on the competition between James Blunt and Niki Lauda, both on the F1 circuit, and off the tracks.Howards manages to draw the interest of viewers, even of those who thinks that Formula 1 is a remain of the past, like safari, fur-coats and tobacco.The main actors are really good, and never once did I question their impersonations. Niki is described as a sensible, reflexive person ; whereas James Hunt is shown as childish, self-centered and sometimes toxic for his entourage.My only dislike is related to the direction of photography. The balance of colors, the composition, the choices of focal lengths, the vibration of the image to convey emotion (trembling hands, engine vibration, etc) ... I like none of those.But the story and acting saves it all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Turbo is a movie I really detest more then ever, because of what it did to Indy car racing. Nothing intense was blown over into the racing sport, but I think that my making a snail the better racer, this will actually prevent any interest in children to look into the actual human racers. I've said before that even though I don't follow much racing (I find NASCAR a total bore), but the Indy car circuit is something that holds a lot of nostalgic memories. I've attended the Long Beach Grand Prix almost every year ever since I was five, and I already have my ticket for next year.I can understand why a lot of other people don't find the same passion that I do. It can be just as boring as NASCAR and being that it's under stricter rules then Hogwarts, then where's the sense of rebellion? I tell those folks the following- Driving an Indy Car is more dangerous then NASCAR- The track is more difficult to navigate and requires more focus- I find the high-tech design of the vehicles fascinating- The races are not as long- Watching the dialogue of the sponsor leaders is like watching senators fight each other- There's more pressure on the driver to impress with their racing and their instinct.This all happens to also be the rules of the Formula One circuit in Europe in the historical drama, Rush.James Hunt (played by Chris Hemsworth) and Nick Lauda (played by Daniel Brühl) in 1970 are both skilled drivers that build a rivalry at the start of their careers in a Formula Three Race in England. Hunt is a very brash, philandering playboy, while Lauda is more focused, determined racer who uses his own technical genus to develop a better car.Lauda goes as far to get a large loan from the bank so that he can buy his way into the Formula One circuit. He later becomes discovered by Ferrari and joins them, where he wins his first championship in 1975. Hunt spends time on and off his team when they fail to secure a sponsor, but manages to get a spot on the McLaren team when another quits. Each driver manages to rack up points from each race, furthering their revelry through the 1976 season. During the German Grand Prix, Lauda meets a terrible demise as he ends up in a critical crash that leaves his face heavily scarred with burns and terrible pain. He decides to race two months later, not wanting Hunt to win the points as easily. Both guys may have more respect then hatred when the final race in Japan proves to be more treacherous then ever.I came in knowing I was going to watch a good movie. I didn't think that this would be great. Director Ron Howard must be a fan of Formula One car racing, as Rush just looks gorgeous. This is a beautiful looking movie, as it's doing a mix of a seventies television style tint along with a stylish tone.Both Hemsworth and Brühl both work out great as these two rival drivers. What I like about the story is that even though that the racing audience loves them, they are both two different kinds of jerks. Hunt may have more of a likable appeal to the cameras with his quick skills, Lauda is the better racer, knowing his own car better then his mechanics. The pacing here manages to flow just as well as one of the Formula One machines, knowing when to be loud and when to slow down and allow it's story to be told.I'll give this ten Formula One helmets out of ten. This could be the best movie about auto racing around (I don't care for Days of Thunder). Rush is thrilling, tragic, and respectable; just like the two racers of the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well Written, Well Cast, Well Directed- Must For Racing Fans</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I a way I equate this with a sort of drama between the 2 drivers that comes off as sort of a Ben Hur type of drama. I think that if I were a big time racing fan, I'd like it more but I am still at a strong 7 here. Ron Howard shows he can still direct and tell a story well behind the camera. He has a script written by the same guy who has written other films for him (like Frost-Nixon). The drama gets very strong here.As for the sex sequences, they are laughable. One thing Hollywood does well is portray hugs, love, and kisses. One thing it does poorly is the sex beyond. Luckily there is only a minimum of it in this movie.The casting of the leads is excellent as both actors are solid in their roles. The film does start a bit slow but moves along well at the end. Being shorter at the end is an asset as you leave the theater with the illusion the entire movie was speedy.Strong finish at the checkered flag sends off the viewer with a good feeling.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I blame IMDb for not being totally enthralled in this movie. A poll suggesting it should have gotten some award buzz and a rating of over 8, I was expecting good old fashioned story telling. captivating character development. Something classic. Instead I got a really great Sunday night movie. One reviewer said "captivating story of two world renowned people", but I never heard of them before "Rush". Sure, F1 was, and is, not part of my life but at the end of the day this is a film. Regardless of knowing the characters a film should make one want to get to know them, and admittedly the characters were not captivating enough which was by no means a lack in acting skill. Rather, struggled drawing interest out of a famous driver that a non-F1 fan could relate to. Maybe the problem is that Niki is far more interesting than James Hunt? Nonetheless, to spite my lack of connection to the characters the film was well worth the watch. The cinematography was at times so avant-garde in the sense that I was hating it, then loving it, then hating, then loving - so I appreciate it, and respect it which is far more superior to just loving it.The acting was on point - to spite the lack of interest, i mean the characters weren't interesting enough to google anything about them that the film didn't tell me. The music was good, not too memorable nor distracting so fair in its delivery.The locations were nicely covered and the production design was (especially in the pits) well realised in terms of the fact that its a period drama. "Rush" cannot be faulted in its entirety, my expectations was the disappointment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I remember as a kid watching the final race of the 1976 F1 season live on television and the tussle between Nikki Lauda and James Hunt.It was only when I was older I realised what Lauda had gone through at the earlier part of the season when he suffered that horrendous crash.Rush is a film about two committed, driven and at times equally infuriating and detestable racers.Lauda the calculating, loner from a business minded family who was well known strategist and for the set ups of his racing car. Daniel Brühl captures the spirit of this almost cold, aloof character who will then have to recover from an almost fatal accident and make him appear human, even likable.Chris Hemsworth has the showy role as the wild, erratic, playboy James Hunt. Always looking to have a good time with party and girls and rather reckless on the track. However Hunt as his own demons and in the 1976 Formula 1 season, he spends most of his time chasing Lauda who had a dominant points tally.Unlike other race films, director Ron Howard did not have try too hard in getting a thrilling story-line. Real life provided it. Lauda was well ahead in the championship until his accident which allowed Hunt to claw back, but Lauda miraculously recovered enough despite his burns and returned to racing and the title went to the final race decider.Both actors capture the spirit of the people they portray. Hunt became well known to racing fans after his retirement as a F1 commentator and Hemsworth does well in getting his vocal mannerisms with maybe just a lapse or two to his Aussie accent.I reckon the film would have little interest to those who despise racing but for others there is plenty of thrills here.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A well told sports story that was engaging and makes great use of sound to draw in the viewer</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>On the day I watched Rush I had just been listening to a film review show from Mark Kermode and Simon Mayo from early January 2014 in which they had discussed an acceptable moratorium for spoilers. Kermode's reasoning for always being careful is that even if something happened in real life, it is unfair to assume everyone knows this, so it is worth avoiding details of the ends of movies. At the time it was a discussion I just listened to but it came back to me when watching Rush because many months prior in their review, the pair did not talk about the outcome of the story or the fates of the characters involved. This was important to me because I did not know of these guys apart from their names ? I was born in the 1970s and really only watched F1 for a few years when Hill and Schumacher were going at it, so for me this was a real thriller and not just a dramatic retelling of stories I knew already.And I watched it as such although I acknowledge that for those in the know, perhaps the film will have a different impact. For me though I really enjoyed it because one of the main things it does is to show how totally life and death the sport was back then, how unforgiving the conditions were and how everything was being driven right on the edge of what was possible. As it is an American film there is perhaps more explanation than was necessary, plus the races themselves are really cut down to be a handful of sequences of overtaking and dramatics; again this may annoy some, but as someone who drifted away from the sport after watching one too many processions around a track, this was fine by me. That said, the racing action is shot with urgency and quick edits around the cars and the driver POV to put the viewer in the middle of the action, although this is not the main weapon, because that is the sound editing.By another coincidence I had recently watched a show with Idris Elba about his passion for cars and speed and one of my complaints had been that the sound of these powerful engines had been impacted upon by unnecessary music, losing a bit of the sense of the power and speed. With Rush the opposite is wonderfully true ? the music can be easy to miss because the main soundtrack is that of the engines. I can only imagine the impact of seeing it in the cinema but even for me the sound effects were great. Outside of the races the creation of the characters is solid ? not deep or detailed but more than enough to make the point and engage the viewer. Hunt and Lauda are shown in broad but effective strokes and their rivalry and begrudging respect is clear ? this is important because although it is a race, the film needs us to be on side with both of them, recognizing the flaws of each but also respecting them.The performances from Hemsworth and Brühl both work well at this level. I don't know the people from real life but from the clips and summary at the end it seemed like they got it pretty well as it needed to be. The supporting cast continues the "broad strokes" approach and are good enough to engage the viewer. Howards' direction is brisk and, although F1 purists may not appreciate the rapid edits and shots, I thought the approach helped build tension. I do think that knowing all the details of the true story will limit the impact of the film at a dramatic level, but I think it is strong enough to hold the interest anyway thanks to how well it tells the story full stop. It may not have a lot of depth and detail, but in the focus on the rivalry and these two men it is engaging with a good hatful of moments which were thrilling and moving.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Rush" is a formulaic piece that excels in almost every way other than its predictability. It's well acted, well filmed, and has great music to boot. If it wins an Oscar for something I'd expect it for the music first, then perhaps an acting nomination to Daniel Brühl (Niki Lauda) second.You do not need to be a formula 1 racing fan to enjoy this movie. I have never watched an F1 race in my life, nor even seen an F1 movie before this one. What makes the movie interesting is not the sport, but the main characters and their relationship with each other.It's a brilliantly acted rivalry between Niki Lauda (Brühl) and James Hunt (Hemsworth). Both turn in A+ performances. By far the best performance I've yet seen from Hemsworth. He proved to me, with this movie, that he's more than just an action star. However he is outshone by Brühl. The film succeeds in showing both the tough exterior and the still tough but different inside personality of Lauda. That's a major accomplishment for both the director and the actor.What makes Rush worth watching isn't the suspense of what is going to happen next. It's perhaps one of the most formulaic sports movies I've ever seen. It succeeds in spite of that. It's the depiction of the main characters, their rude exchanges, and their underlying respect for each other, that makes it worth the 2 hours.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a Rush</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rush is Ron Howard's best up to date, a visceral thrill ride. It is an exceedingly well crafted sports drama movie, that focuses on the rivalry between two distinctly different men in the gladiatorial world that was Formula 1 racing in the 70s."25 drivers start every season in Formula One, and each year, two of us die. What kind of person does a job like this? Not normal men, for sure. Rebels, lunatics, dreamers... people who are desperate to make a mark and are prepared to die trying"- Niki LaudaIt is 1976, Bernie Ecclestone is yet to take center stage, race car drivers are superstars with low life expectancy and all that is worth looking forward to in Formula 1 racing is the competition between James Hunt and Niki Lauda. Both of them supremely, almost inhuman racing talents, with arrogance to spare. Yet they could not be more different- Hunt's brash style versus Lauda's cool discipline. Hunt's live life to the max philosophy, versus Lauda's switchblade efficiency.James Hunt: The closer you are to death, the more alive you feel. It's a wonderful way to live. It's the only way to drive.Niki Lauda: A wise man can learn more from his enemies than a fool from his friends.Shot in documentary style, Rush does not seek to establish deep human connect, but instead etches out the story of two diverse personalities competing for the same prize. Whose side are you on? Never mind that because even if you do not understand the difference between motor sports and basketball, or even if you are not a petrol head, you will still be enthralled. Rush is a blur of exquisitely choreographed races, a palette of gorgeous cars and women, a fight for racing immortality between two crazies. Ron Howard has been churning out tripe lately (The DaVinci Code, Angels &amp; Demons). Here is back in form in adrenalin pumping style. The pace is snappy, the editing brisk, the soundtrack is racy, and the dialogs memorable. But the most crucial aspect of a gripping conflict was getting the casting spot on. People would believe this is Chris Hemsworth's breakout role, irrespective of recent past involving Norse gods, hammers and other superheroes. While he is great as the bodacious Hunt, it is actually Daniel Bruhl's Niki Lauda who steals the show, creating sympathy for a self absorbed, myopic, rude and an essentially unlikeable person.Who was the better racer- Hunt or Lauda? Does not matter. What matters is Rush is an un-missable movie, and hence is, quote WWE's Road Warriors- "what aaaaa rush"- 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great production value, amazing performances</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Finally. Just when I thought that this year had been without a single highlight with respect to Hollywood (co)productions in general, I had the pleasure of watching this little marvel.The story is fast paced, well thought of and does not paint its characters entirely in black or in white, like we are used to from other "blockbusters". The effects are great, but without bludgeoning viewers to death with unlikely and unconvincing CGI. The movie lasts about two hours, but it's one of the few instances where I wouldn't even have minded a 2h30 or 3h production, had it included more details about the drivers' lives, their competitors and some more background. It was a gripping mix that left nothing to be desired.But the most impressive part of it all was the acting of the two main characters (Hunt &amp; Lauda): Truthfully, I would not have expected such an impeccable characterization work from Chris Hemsworth, who is generally known for solid, but certainly not for overwhelming performances (e.g. Thor, Star Trek). His work here is admirable, translating Hunt's playboy on the one hand and his insecure side on the other hand to perfection.However, it was Daniel Brühl's brilliant performance as Niki Lauda that put everything else into perspective. Having met Niki Lauda personally and, as an Austrian myself, having seen him interact many times on T.V. and on the radio, Brühl just nailed it with flying colors. The resemblance not only concerning Lauda's appearance, but most of all with regard to his mannerisms is almost frightening. Brühl, as a German, had to learn to talk with an Austrian accent in English AND in German, including Niki Lauds's very specific and rather odd pronunciations. Needless to say he mastered everything flawlessly. Heck, if he ever chose to stop acting, he could start a career as a Lauda imitator. To summarize it, his whole act was extremely convincing, the interactions with everybody else appeared genuine and most of all his enemy/friend chemistry with Chris Hemsworth was brilliant.I'd like to see one more competition between these two: Brühl &amp; Hemsworth should be nominated, Brühl should win this competition and get the Oscar.All in all, I'm glad to see that not all hope is lost for cinematic productions and that some movies still focus on their stories and their characters instead of regurgitating the embarrassing tripe that we've been served as "blockbusters" this year (e.g. World War Z, Elysium, Oblivion &amp; many more).</fullReview>

I think the script does a pretty great job of outlining certain incidences and outcomes in the two leads' journey. Hemsworth is good enough, very charismatic like always, but I think this is Daniel Bruhl's film through and through. He's pretty amazing in the role and despite the contrary, he makes his character way more likable. He's undeniably leading, arguably more of a lead than Hemsworth, but I don't care... I want him to get that Oscar nomination. The film editing and cinematography are also pretty impressive, and Howard does a great job behind the camera. Highly recommended!</fullReview>

Throughout the film,the characters' psychologically impelled to take along and create more meaningful message about life, about passion and energy of humans.Niki Lauda is a typical image man have passion for what they determined to go to the end of it while James Hunt is a representative for young people always desire to express yourself, and victory or bitter defeat reinforces the power of reason.Chris Hemsworth and Daniel Bruhl has shown great performance in Rush.Daniel Bruhl's acting deserves to be nominated Oscar for "Best Supporting Actor" the following year.Rush has many beautiful scenes, especially the Grand Prix stage race Fuji (Japan). The daring cinematography on F1 help for the viewer to feel the excitement as the audience directly track racers to the finish as well as the dangers of this sport. Director Ron Howard also use historical footage of the Grand Prix race in 1976 as well as the winner of Lauda and Hunt. The competition between the two "giants" of the legendary Formula 1 Ferrari and McLaren are also included in the film.Powerful cinematic language is also very sexy and Ron Howard takes the viewer through many emotional states and eventually left the aftertaste mix between sweet and bitter. Whether a fan of Formula 1 sport or movie lover normal, almost everyone will experience feeling "suffocated" when watched the legendary race track between Niki Lauda and James Hunt.It was reproduced on screen wide through subtle way of director Ron Howard.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is seriously one of the best films I've ever seen, and I've seen several on the top 250 list. The cinematography is stunning, every race scene was poster-worthy. The acting is superb... I never really cared for Chris Hemsworth prior to this film, he seemed so arrogant and one - dimensional in his prior films, but he proved that he has depth and solid acting skills in this film. I also feel that his acting skills have matured recently because he was great in Thor: The Dark World. You really get the sense that he is larger than life as James Hunt, and that he is a true playboy.Hunts rivalry with Niki Lauda is epic, it really is a remarkable story of two men risking everything to one-up each other in life and on the race track. There are so many twists and turns in the story, and it flows really well. Of course the race scenes were the most action oriented portion of the film, and they were epic and visually stunning. My heart was racing (pun intended), and I got totally lost in the moment and it felt like I was in the film so to speak. This is one of those movies that are made for the big screen too, I highly recommend that you see it in theaters if you get the chance.The film is severely under-valued to have made as few box office sales as it did. I went on a Friday night, the night it was released, and the theater was only about 10% occupied. It's a shame that people flock to crap like Harry Potter, Twilight, Transformers, etc. and don't but nearly as much emphasis on truly well rounded films like Rush.</fullReview>

Bruhl's portrayal of Lauda in particular is great - his drive, intelligence &amp; unlikable character funnily enough endeared him to me! I knew little of the story before watching, my only experience of Formula 1 racing is of a background noise at home in the late nineties on a Sunday afternoon. But what a story this was.

The way the relationship between James Hunt and Niki Lauda is portrayed in such a beautiful and intelligent way that after the movie ends you won't be able to take sides on who you would support from the two champion drivers.

		<fullReview>I have watched a rather old version of this story line in Grand Prix, a film featuring James Gardner. This move does take the next step and really tries to let the viewer get inside the head of the driver,how he is feeling as the car reaches extremely high speeds and truly how it feels to keep control and succeed in this dangerous sport. The cast of mainly new talent was well chosen. They are reported to me based on real people, which makes this picture even more genuine and keeps the excitement and energy of this film going until the end. The technical side of this also has to be mentioned, as it has made the project even more intense. Seldom does one get inside a speeding car and really feel the pressure of the movements, virtually pulling one around in your own movie seat. Grand Prix was not a true story only based on the particular race in the South of France and Monaco. This however, is a true story which makes it all the more powerful and exciting to watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw an ad for this film in the cinema foyer and I thought to myself that the man in the racing car looked like Niki Lauda. I had no idea who the good looking blonde driver was meant to be though. Maybe that comes into it. Anyway, turns out the ad was for a fact based dramatisation of actual Formula 1 racing car drivers...so, Daniel Brühl already has some credit in the bank for his portrayal of the multi-time world champion Formula 1 driver Niki Lauda. This movie got a good review on "At the movies" so that also made me more inclined to watch it. However, seeing Australian Chris Hemsworth as the "other" driver (James Hunt) in the clip for the movie on that TV show made me think that his English accent seemed quite contrived...sort of a clipped, aristocratic accent...I'm thinking ball park Prince Philip territory here! In any case, this wasn't so marked to me in the movie proper, so it wasn't a negative for me.Especially early on, this movie has a sort of comic book feel to the proceedings...or perhaps "Boy's own adventure" is another way of saying this...perhaps a bit of a 1970s English movie feel to the movie as well...or swinging 1960s style. In other words, it seems pitched more as entertainment than gritty, realistic drama. Personally I found the racing in the movie lacked much detail, insight and intensity, but on occasion the racing presented was all those things...as when Niki Lauda weaves between F1 cars after coming back from the hospital.Where the movie does hold great interest and drama is in the factual information presented to the audience via on screen text...i.e. who won a certain race or what the season leaderboard looks like. It's this aspect which makes the movie engrossing when the actual driving scenes don't. You're made aware of where Hunt stands in relation to Lauda in their fight for the F1 crown.Also fascinating is the insight into the business of racing at this time in the sport's history. You see what Hunt and Lauda were doing before they made it into the big league of racing...their time in Formula 4 (I think it was "4").Watching the movie, it occurred to me that it quite easily have been all about Niki Lauda and his journey. I can't say that I could have associated the name "James Hunt" with the phrase "champion F1 driver" but the movie is very informative in making a case for that proposition and justifies its approach of making the theme of this movie the rivalry between these two disparate drivers.In creating an approach based on rivalry it also occurred to me that perhaps the movie fabricated the interactions between these two drivers. On screen, they appear to be in each other's pocket most of the time and I really couldn't believe it was like that in reality. However, at the end of the movie there was some archival footage of Hunt and Lauda chatting to each other at a racetrack, which makes me wonder if there is more truth in this movie than I thought.That being said, there were many times when my credulity did not come easily. For instance, did Hunt really give that reporter an answer like to that to what the reporter asked Lauda at a press conference? Did that actually happen? Did Lauda really watch that on TV when he was receiving treatment? They had televisions in those rooms? Really? Those scenes make for good drama and narrative motivation, but still, I was wondering where truth ended and fiction began. To a lesser extent, I found it hard that Lauda accept the premise of the barbs Hunt would throw at him pre-race at times...surely, if that happened, Lauda would just ignore such a prat, right? If all this stuff happened though, than it is a terrific representation of the duality of Hunt's relationship to Lauda.Overall, this movie is like a philosophical representation of two competing life philosophies...in the form of two extreme, polar opposite personalities. No doubt the middle ground between them would be the ideal in life...perhaps. It would be lovely to think that Hunt and Lauda did have their conversation at Lauda's jet inside the hangar as depicted in the movie. I also liked in that scene how Lauda puts into words something that I was thinking about Hunt's status. Whilst unsure of the actuality of the scene, I also liked how Hunt proffered some home truths to Lauda when the latter unsuccessfully tried to have a race cancelled due to rain.Perhaps it was in "At the movies" where director Ron Howard admitted having doubts as to whether Chris Hemsworth had the acting chops to pull off this performance. I found Chris performance engaging but he also has a couple of scenes where he gives good reaction shots to the dramas he faces...he really 'inhabits that moment' so to speak."Rush" has a climactic race between Hunt and Lauda at the end of the movie. Initially I thought Lauda's action implied something, but on reflection I found it a cagey move perhaps worth the gamble, even if the movie posits an entirely different motive for his action.Just in passing, I'll note that Niki Lauda did get referenced in a song by The Music Men on the audience performance segment of the TV show "Hey hey it's Saturday". Seeing this movie, it does now seem cruel in retrospect.As mentioned in my opening paragraph, even though I am only slightly aware of F1 history and even less of James Hunt as a player in it, this movie does a sterling job of rectifying that situation.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rush to the Oscar Award Ceremony!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Oscars is a long way away, but this movie will be remembered for a long time.First of all, I didn't know too much about the back story of this rivalry, however people need to understand this is a movie, the idea is not to follow the exact real life event, but to throw in a few new ideas.This movie was really great, the trailer did not exactly deliver, meaning, lets just put it this way, when I booked ticket to see this movie I brought my pillow and pajamas just in case. Now enough with the silly jokes and puns, the movie progresses through with the introduction of Stephen Hunt with Niki Lauda appearing later on to rival him, severe tension arises between them along with their romantics events then slowly but surely the movie builds up to a ultimate series of events which begin crash down on us, I did say i'd stop with the puns right?Anyway I have to applaud the way the movie is compiled and how the ending is shown. Without spoiling anything I have to give credit to Peter Morgan/Ron Howard for their superb avoidance of portraying a jolly, joyful and friendly ending, instead they showed a mutual understanding between Hunt and Lauda, in which after doing my research was pretty accurate to what occurred in real life.Overall great movie, and yes, as the Summary Title says I can assure you an Oscar or two will be dealt out here, possibly Daniel Brühl and Chris Hemsworth will have a rivalry of their own for an Oscar? Time will tell.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was an amazing film! I haven't seen a film in ages which gave me that kind of enjoyment. And not to mention it had Daniel Bruhl playing a lead character which is always good.My dad forced me to go to the cinema to watch this as it was based of the 1976 F1, the time when he had just gotten into F1. Now, I have never really been into F1, so I thought "Okay, this film isn't going to be that good." But by god I was wrong!!The part which got me in the film was when Niki was in the fire. I knew he would live as my dad had already told me so (As before I had not seen the trailers) but it was the fact that Niki just kept shouting 'Get me out!' as the people struggled to get him out. It was just so terrifyingly awesome! And then when later they said he was stuck in 800 degrees plus for a whole minute I was just like oh my god! And the thing which really made me shiver was that this actually happened to the real Niki Lauda!I also loved the part when a reporter asked Niki does he think his wife will still love him with his burnt face and James just beat the living hell out of him for asking that! That made me so happy as even though they are rivals, they still care.Overall, the film was a massive success with great actors and a brilliant sound track. It is something I recommend you watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Growing up watching F1 with my dad are some of the great memories i am glad to have. Being at a race and experiencing the noise and excitement of the chase is something else. Mr. Howard did an amazing job making this film. To be honest, I did not really know what to expect when going to see this film. I was very impressed with the movie in a whole. From the acting to the direction of the movie and how it was filmed. The camera angles and shots where impressive. The movie portrayed the formula 1 racing era during the 70's very well. the Movie was around 2 hours, I think. It really felt like an hour. I was on the edge of my seat for most of it. In my opinion, no scene was dragged out. the scenes were shot and they moved on with the story. I really liked that.I would gladly go see this again, and take my friends. Thanks, Mr. Howard, for another great film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went to this film with boyhood memories of James Hunt. I had the toy car (hey I was only 7 years old at the time) and didn't understand motor racing but I remember that final race and to see it reconstructed here had me quite literally on the edge of my seat. This is a very fast moving (pun not intentional) film - extremely well acted, edited and directed. Ron Howard certainly has some back catalogue, but I think this is one of his best. Yes there's quite a bit of artistic licence and a poor script in places - but that doesn't matter - the events actually happened. Nikki Lauda suffered those horrific burns following that crash and James Hunt liked sex, drugs and alcohol (the former a bit too much) but they were both 70s icons and it's good to see their rivalry, their story on celluloid. Thumping testosterone soundtrack too! Don't miss this (although you may want to look away when Lauda has a very large suction tube inserted into his lungs!).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nothing short of spectacular</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Captivating, breathtaking, beautiful. This is how I would describe Howard's latest project, "Rush", a movie which tells you about the passion of sports as much as it tells you about life and death.Set in the 70's, the movie explores the real life events of the legendary rivalry of James Hunt and Niki Lauda. An English playboy and an Austrian professional, respectively, these two men with direct contrast in their lives and views had one thing in common: their passion for racing. Their explosive competitive nature begins when they meet in a Formula 3 match in 1970 and culminates on the World Grand Prix of 1976. During the course of those six years, they both learn what it is to live your life and cheat death, while looking it straight in the eye, as they set their lives aside to take a risk in what is one of the most dangerous sports. Emotionally, this film is one that you will hold your breath for more times than one.The cinematography is compact and panoramic, and it grabs every aspect of the racing track and its components seamlessly. From the moment the credits disappear, you are transferred back into the 70's, from the vintage cars of the era to the colours of each detail. The music is fitting, and when you find yourself losing tiny details, it draws you back to place, and your focus is once again at its peak. Chris Hemsworth (Thor, Star Trek: Into Darkness), proves that he got the part thanks to more than his likeness to the real James Hunt. He fluctuates wonderfully between the passionate and fearless driver and the party animal who wants to live a good life. In comparison, Daniel Brühl (Inglorious Basterds) as Niki Lauda is icy, professional, ruled by rules in every aspect of his life. Wonderfully executed by Brühl, don't be surprised if you root for him in the end, especially after the race of Nurburgring in 1976.If you are a fan of F1 and this particular rivalry, this movie does it complete justice and it adds a bit of drama to carefully narrate a story that has been told amongst racing cycles for years. If, like me, are no interested in racing, you will still appreciate this movie for its sheer emotion, its beautiful story telling, its 70-esque settings and wonderful acting.Don't miss this movie. And don't be surprised if it ends up receiving some Academy Awards as well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Winning Film About Winning</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I almost passed on watching "Rush" because I am not really a fan of F1 car racing. However, very positive word of mouth egged me to squeeze it into my schedule. The buzz proved true -- this is one excellent film.Austrian Niki Lauda is a straight-laced, super-serious and introverted man, already a world champion the year before. British James Hunt is a happy-go-lucky, smoking and drinking, and gregarious ladies man, looking for his first major title. During the 1976 F1 season, Niki Lauda was leading all the way on total points until a devastating event threatened not only his crown, but his life. Can he summon enough will to fight the mortal odds and recover in order to race to the finish, or will James Hunt just be handed the championship cup of his dreams on a silver platter?Even if we only see Chris Hemsworth's face in the posters as James Hunt, this film was more about Niki Lauda, played with devastating realism by Daniel Bruhl. The conflict between two racing arch-nemeses with contrasting personalities seemed to be too ideal a story to be true, but amazingly this film indeed was inspired by a real events. We would witness their relationship evolve from jealousy, enmity, challenge, admiration to respect.Their relationships with the women in their lives were so well-executed in order to further delineate our two main characters off the track. James and his whirlwind marriage to New York-based model Suzy (Olivia Wilde) again contrasted perfectly with Niki and his calculated marriage to the elegant Marlene (Alexandra Maria Lara). The racing scenes were very intense, so well-shot. Those scenes when you see the track in the point of view of the driver. You can smell not only the gas and the fumes, but the adrenaline rush in the air. You can feel the real danger as past accidents were shown in ominous graphic detail. These scenes will definitely be showered technical Oscar nominations for cinematography, editing, sound and sound effects mixing. Director Ron Howard takes full advantage of the inherent drama in these events to create a very tense film, not only on the race tracks, but also in their personal lives and their philosophies about winning. Even if I did not know Lauda and Hunt, I was drawn into their story complete with all the ingredients of epic action, drama, and romance. Howard does not lose control of his material as everything fell in its right place in the gripping final cut of the film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This moved at a pace similar to motor racing, hardly pausing for breath. Sometimes you hear contrived dialogue in films of this type but here the dialogue was delivered as fast as the action on the screen. No long monologues here.The two leads had to carry the film...and did. Showing rivalry without it being too bitter or really getting nasty and ultimately having utmost respect for each other. Out of the two I thought Hemsworth was probably the better, nailing the British accent especially that which has a plum in its mouth. The supporting cast did not really have a lot to to other than look concerned as they raced or whoop or otherwise when race over.Motor racing scenes will not disappoint the motor racing fans amongst you...with plenty of noise and pulsing music to go with it.Was a bit worried of someone as long in the tooth as Ron Howard directing; thought a young jazzy/visionary director would stamp himself all over this one, but no Howard directed with gusto and at pace.So yeah, jump into the driving seat on this one for a couple of hours as it is based on a good, true story with the rivals being two totally opposite characters.</fullReview>

The film is based on a true story and follows the rivalry between 2 legendary Formula 1 drivers James Hunt and Niki Lauda in the mid 1970's.After watching interviews with the drivers and short documentaries on the events that occurred the film seems extremely accurate and the two performances from Chris Hemsworth and Daniel Brühl are spot on.

		<shortDescription>Less compelling than the real thing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>James Hunt and Nikki Lauda, rivals on the track in Formula One, were both born into wealthy backgrounds, had the attention of beautiful women, and were both very arrogant young men, albeit in different ways. You might think that a dramatic reconstruction of their careers might not seem very appealing; but you might also remember that the documentary 'Senna', about another talented, spoilt and arrogant young racer was actually quite compelling. Unfortunately, Ron Howard's 'Rush' takes a simplistic approach to representing both the character of the two men and also the intricacies of racing, sometimes combining idiocies in both departments simultaneously (in the first race we see, Hunt is beating Lauda to some championship - the cumulation of a season's racing - without apparently even knowing who he is). You won't learn much about motor racing from this film, nor what makes a good driver, nor even much about the two men's characters beyond a tabloid characterisation. Even the track footage is strangely uncompelling.</fullReview>

You connect with them and find your heart in your throat when you watch them race, even if you already might know what's coming.Brilliant acting and writing.

My interest in F1 has now started thanks to this marvellous film that focuses on the relentless rivalry between stars James Hunt and Niki Lauda that took place in the 70's racing scene. Ron Howard directs with energy and flair, carefully balancing flashbacks and current moments together to create a fast moving movie, plus the camera-work is something to behold, especially when focusing on close ups of car engines revving, glass being blown in the wind and rain water flicking up into the air. The stars look as good as the cars, with Chris Hemsworth delivering a performance I never thought he'd pull off, not to say he's a bad actor, he's not and he proves this playing James Hunt, Hemsworth is so unforgettable. Daniel Bruhl is just as powerful as Hemsworth, playing the somewhat lonely but driven Niki Lauda who proves fierce competition to the cocky Brit driver. Would I watch Rush again? Without a doubt, the racing scenes are absolutely gripping and the performances are tremendous, do not miss this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Auto-Sports Racing Film There Is</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>****SPOILER ALERTS****Growing up in Indiana the only racing I really ever followed was one ... actually only one race that is: the Indianapolis 500 -- I occasionally would watch another Indy-class race or even a stock car race but growing up in the 60s and 70s, Formula 1 racing was hardly ever shown on American TV ... perhaps only on ABC's Wide World of Sports but I can't remember too many of those even (this of course was long, long before cable TV was even available and all-sports channels let alone all-auto-racing channels were ever thought of or dreamed of I imagine) ... even Sports Illustrated, the biggest and most popular sports magazine of the time, gave piddling coverage to Formula 1 racing ...That is until one moment in time: the horrific crash of Niki Lauda ... let me remind everyone of the tried-and-terribly-true journalism credo: "If it bleeds, it leads" ... and so Sports Illustrated and even TV sports shows were quite suddenly very interested in the state of Niki and of Formula 1 racing ... cover stories were even devoted to this crash and the weekly sports magazines and shows were regularly doing in-depth coverage of Niki's recovery and then his amazing comeback not to mention the dynamic dual of Lauda and James Hunt for the world title that year ... and yes, even as a young teen, I too was engrossed in the monumental recovery and courageous return to racing that Niki made that year only to drop-out of the final race that season due to what he deemed to be unsafe racing conditions, that being a fairly heavy and constant rainstorm ... Hunt was able to win the world championship that season by only a single point having gained many points during Niki's (only) two race absence after the severe burns he received inside and outside his body which drew the sporting world's attention to him and Formula 1 racing that season ...This movie not only covers the pure guts and determination of Niki's will to be a champion but shows the sport of auto racing better than any other movie I have ever seen ... it makes you feel the power of the machines, the speed and the mere inches these drivers operate within at those speeds, and the frightening results of a single miscalculation of the speed and inches they compete within ... But I was further surprised that this film was directed by Ron Howard ... this is not to say I am not a Ron Howard fan ... I usually enjoy his films though some can be rather sappy etc (imho) and not to my taste but I do not shy away from watching most of his movies ... but thinking of joining his directorial skills and style with this sport and story was surprising to me and so when I came across it through some accidental luck on IMDb, I made sure to see it purely out of interest to see how all of these ingredients would mix ... well, the mix perfectly and this is a film to be admired and one that I would think would make most people's pulse jump a bit from the fine editing (credited to Dan Henley and Mike Hill) and perfectly planned racing sequences which, I have read, were a mix of principal photography, cgi, and archival footage ... a flawless blend to my eye and many kudos to all the folks involved on that side of the production ...This is the best racing film I have ever seen and I would imagine the best one out there if judging only by the racing sequences alone ... I am not including the standard car chase scenes that pollute so many movies these days as frankly, those are most typically tiresome retreads (pun intended) of all the other car chase sequences done in all the other movies where you basically wait around for fifteen or twenty minutes for the next car chase to begin (let's take the "Fast and Furious" franchise for an example ... as one critic on this thread complained of the "wooden acting" in between the race sequences in this movie, I can't imagine what could be more oaken than the "acting" which interrupts the car chases in F&amp;F franchise ... and for the record, the acting in "Rush" is not wooden but well done and the interplay and sparks between Chris Hemsworth and Daniel Brühl (along with their counterparts) do not make it so you sit around only waiting for the next action sequence ... it is well done and each of the stars have a firm grip on the character and "character" of the man they are portraying ...This is one of Howard's very best films, the best auto-sports film around, and a rock solid 10 in my book ... highly recommended for racing fans, of course (who have probably sought this out already) but also for fans of movies of people overcoming inner and external injuries and shortcomings to achieve their goals and it is quite certainly not one of the oh-so-many sappy, Hollywood cookie-cutter "oh golly he got grievously injured or had inner demons he had to overcome to finally win the big one and get the girl and have millions of adoring fans and the old-time trainer who never got his shot at the big time but knows everything it takes to get to the big time and finally found the one pupil he could impart all of this knowledge upon, etc, etc, etc" movies ... it is high-quality storytelling of each character's striving to become the best at what they do ...definitely one to keep a copy of as it is worth watching on a semi-regular basistake care, cormac"One star in the sky so I named it Otis Redding" -- John Hiatt</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Daniel Bruhl Is About All There Is</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Daniel Bruhl's intelligent performance as Austrian race car driver Niki Lauda is about all there is to recommend in director Ron Howard's film about the rivalry between Lauda and English driver James Hunt (a preening Chris Hemsworth). Bruhl's focused, steel-eyed stare and effortlessly executed diction is filled with a sly sense of irony and sets apart what could have been a routine impersonation of a cold, clipped Germanic workhorse. After all these years, Howard still can't figure out how to deliver action without having to explain it to you and, as such, relies heavily on screenwriter Peter Morgan's heavy-handed exposition to tell you what you need to know. Morgan accomplishes this by having sportscasters yell into microphones about how the action taking place is so exciting; the result is condescending. Other than Bruhl, there isn't much else to recommend, with a couple of Howard's collaborators worth noting, cinematographer Anthony Dod Mantle and composer Hans Zimmer, turning in lesser work than they are capable of. Being a racing movie, it's edited within an inch of its life by longtime Howard colleagues Dan Hanley and Mike Hill; but their work is at least clean enough that you can reasonably follow along. Which is all Howard requires from you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A bit too academic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With Rush, Ron Howard wraps up a solid film but which lacks as often this little thing that would make it excellent.The scenario is captivating, dynamic, but the rivalry between the two pilots could have deserved more intensity, more tension and most importantly a stronger build up. What makes the story interesting is the captivating, enigmatic character of Niki Lauda embodied by the excellent and charismatic Daniel Brühl, because James Hunt is a lot too superficial and caricatural.As for the cinematography, it is effective especially regarding the racing scenes punctuated by some CGI shots that are for once relevant, but the mise-en-sc?ne remains quite conventional.Anyway, Rush is a very neat movie on every level, but in fact maybe too much, at the same time with Ron Howard as the director you had to anticipate for something very academic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went to see this with my dad and sister. Now, being a girl and not really interested in formula 1 or any racing, i thought i wasn't going to like the film.... I was wrong.Rush is one of the most interesting films i have every seen. I really felt like i was back 1970s. Chris Hemsworth and Daniel Bruhl give great performances as the rival duo Hunt and Lauda. The footage combined with actual footage from the seventies made it more real. This film has everything in it, love,tragedy, laughs and an in site into the mind of a formula one racing driver.The costume department really helped to capture the atmosphere of seventies and the music as well. Daniel Bruhl's accent is extremely well done and never slips during the whole film. Chris also gives a great performance showing the ups and downs of Hunt's life as he works his way up through the leagues in order to become champion.Overall, i think the cast and crew did a great job on the film,the acting is superb and the stunts are amazing. 7 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is recommended.Gentlemen, start your engines! The need for speed is the mainstay in Ron Howard's cinematic ode to racing, Rush, a well crafted, if formulaic, Formula One racing car drama. &nbsp;The film tells the true story of two racing champions, British playboy James Hunt, and temperamental Austrian driver Niki Lauda, and centers on the on-going rivalry between the two drivers. Both are Type A personalities: ambitious, energetic, and competitive. And both are unlikeable characters, which throws the audience's sympathies askew from the onset. &nbsp;They act predictably petty and selfish throughout the film with no real maturity or growth to speak of. There is no real surprises in the character's development, actions, or motivations in Peter Morgan's straightforward script. It also doesn't help that the dialog never builds any real conflict or resolution.Yet what makes Rush so watchable are the purely technical aspects of the film. Howard knows how to set up his shots for maximum effect and he skillfully keeps the action sequences exciting and tense. The Formula One racing scenes are wonderful and quite exhilarating. &nbsp;Particularly impressive is the rain-soaked Grand Prix racing sequence an expect blending of visual images. His biggest misstep is incorporating the real footage of Hunt and Lauda which seems a tad jarring in comparison.The film boasts first-rate production values. The editing by Daniel P. Hanley and Mike Hill is just terrific, as is the stunning photography by Anthony Dod Mantle. &nbsp;Special mention also goes to the expert sound design, the strong makeup work, and a music score by Hans Zimmer which is never overdone or intrusive. The period art direction and costumes help to capture the 70's era with clever subtleties. As long as Rush stays literally on the course, the film is highly entertaining. But whenever it detours into the realm of the human drama, the film is a bit of a bore. This is not the fault of the actors involved. Liam Hemsworth and Daniel Brühl bring the right degree of vanity and physically posturing to their conventional roles. Both actors make their stilted characters more believable. Manyl of the supporting characters are underwritten and rarely seem authentic. This is especially true with the female love interests played by Olivia Wilde and.Alexandra Maria Lara, fine actresses that aren't given enough to do.Although Rush may veer dangerously off trackage times, it does cross the finish line, just not in the winner's circle.

		<fullReview>Finally a men's movie ! I liked it well although I find that a little snivelling at times (while the world of F1 otherwise the motor racing is not at all this way) because sequences on this hero of Niki Lauda are a little supported otherwise accommodating. The leg Ron Howard, doubtless.Fortunately scenes with James Hunt raise the whole of a little hot pepper, and call upon a stalk more respect. I hope at least that the congenital morons'll merge a little less circuit and route... Forgive my broken English but I don't know why I should make a longer commentary, its simply dumb and dumber ! Since when quality equals quantity ? Or maybe the caretakers write the movie reviews (I find out that IMDb has curious manners to consider critics...) So, we could say too that the shortest is the joke is the best of all. You wanna know everything ? Go and see Rush, but don't search for a entire book, it's only entertainment !</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Review: Rush Night Film Reviews www.nightfilmreviews.com</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Loud, proud, and relentless in its portrayal of sport rivals, Ron Howard's Rush is another entry into his formulaic and conventional directing resume. Like any well oiled machine, Howard is an expert of giving audiences a fundamentally linear narrative with striking and beautiful aesthetic choices, even if the narrative follows the rivalry between two Formula One drivers whose careers and competition is anything but straight-cut.Rush isn't the best film of the year by far, and in terms of narrative the film suffers from clichéd plot-points, predictable sport film tropes and by-the-book autobiographical rules, but one of the highlights of Rush is the effortlessness of telling the story of two incredible men's lives, without making one or the other the lead protagonist or antagonist. Rush is the true story of two passionate and talented drivers whose race to becoming the Formula One World Champion is something quite unbelievable.The film begins in the middle of its narrative, at the beginning of the 1976 German Grand Prix in Nürburgring, mere moments before Niki Lauda (Daniel Brühl) experiences what is suspected to be a rear suspension failure that hospitalized him for a month and a half. We then flashback to 1970 at a Formula Three race in the Crystal Palace circuit in England where the rivalry between Lauda and James Hunt (Chris Hemsworth) begins. Destined to be rivals since their initial meeting, the film follows the trails and tribulations of Lauda and Hunt's fight to the Formula One circuit. Lauda, a mechanical genius who uses his skills on cars to earn his spot beside Clay Regazzoni (Pierfrancesco Favino) and the Scuderia Ferrari racing team, shows skill as a engineer but suffers socially, proving to be somewhat inept when it comes to interacting with people. While Hunt, an unapologetic, globetrotting playboy, seems to have no problems interacting with his fans (maybe a little too often). Where Hunt lacks for meticulous calculations and mechanical understanding, things Lauda posses, Hunt makes up for in raw talent, ambition and "balls".The film chronicles not only an intense rivalry set in the dangerous world of Formula One Racing, but the film also depicts a rivalry of wits between two men, who suffer and sacrifice so much for respect in a world inhabited by high-adrelanline, death-defying racers.Rush is definitely a return to form for Howard, who, after the problematic and chaotic The Dilemma, had a lot to prove aesthetically and narratively. Aesthetically, Howard had his wheels spinning uncontrollably with inspiration. From the film's 1970&#x2032;s grainy look, to its very artistic slow-motion racing scenes (which acts as a nice irony to the sport), to the choice of camera angles when covering the pivotal scenes of the race, usually shooting at a very low angle, Howard does use the film to solidify his place as a stylistic filmmaker again, as he did previously with Cinderella Man, Apollo 13 and A Beautiful Mind. Howard surrounded himself with the best this time around, and made no mistakes. With a modest $38 Million budget for a Hollywood film, Howard was able to create an high-octane Formula One film, grounded as a character piece. Written by Peter Morgan (The Queen), shot by Anthony Dod Mantle (Slumdog Millionaire), Scored by Hans Zimmer (The Dark Knight trilogy), and produced by film-extraordinaire and longtime collaborator Brian Grazer, Rush is assembled just like any other team in the Formula One cockpit, meticulously and strategically.It also did not hurt that Howard was able to get Hemsworth out of Nordic armour and deliver his finest performance to date. The real star of the film is Brühl. Underrated and overlooked since his career-defining role in Tarantino's Inglorious Bastards, Brühl inhabits his rat-like character and shows the intolerable side of a man obsessed with perfection, discontent with happiness, and who shows no emotional response to the fast pace world which exists around him. Brühl's transformation into Lauda is one that will hopefully be acknowledged come award season.Rush is a good film. More of a solid entry into the autobiographical sport genre, much like 42 earlier this year, the film lacks an intensity most great sport films have, which is the intensity of the sport itself. Some of the greatest sport movies ever made use the sport to elevate character progression, intense emotion or moments that audiences cheer for. There was never a rousing moment of triumph, pleasure or extreme emotion with our characters that took place on the racetrack. Unfortunately for the film, some of the best scenes happen on the streets of Italy, in the hospital, or in restaurants and furnace rooms where the characters grow and evolve; the racetrack is just a forum for winning.Unfortunately for the audience, between near-fatal crashes, personal lows and tragic endings, Rush never emotionally resonates with us. Lacking for a connection with Hunt and Lauda, Howard doesn't give the audience much time to connect with his drivers the way they do with their vehicles. "Men love women, even more than that, men love cars!". I don't think there could have been a more accurate way to describe the film and the world where testosterone, ego, and fuel, pumps the veins in the hearts of each racer.Night Film Reviews: 7/10 Stars</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a fan of F1 I can say that this movie has every information about 1976. It has a great switch between drivers life and social life of both Niki Lauda and James Hunt. Chris Hemsworth plays James Hunt grippingly, actually I've always imagined James like that. Nice guy, nice accent ;). Daniel Brühl is just Niki Lauda. Well chosen actors. Racing scenes are sometimes breathless, depends how you feel about F1. Of course throughout movie you'll once at side of James but a moment later you're Lauda team.Actors and crew work a lot with Lauda and Chris Hemsworth has to watch a dozen videos of James Hunt witch gave a brilliant final film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ron Howard is back!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ron Howard has come a long way from being a star on The Andy Griffith Show and Happy Days to being one of the most gifted filmmakers of our generation. He has made some great films (Apollo 13 and A Beautiful Mind) and he made some bad ones (The Grinch and The Dilemma). With his latest movie Rush, about the rivalry between James Hunt (Chris Hemsworth) and Niki Lauda (Daniel Brühl) during the 1976 F-1 season, he has literally come back to the top! Chris Hemsworth and Daniel Brühl deliver two of the best performances of the year as Hunt and Lauda, two F-1 racers turned enemies. These are performances where they step right into the character instead of acting for the sake of acting. It's just fascinating to see these two battle each other on and off the racetrack. That gives a sign of true rivalry.The racing sequences are riveting and make you feel as if you are part of the action. The cinematography is fantastic; the pace never drags; it's one of the best experiences of the year.10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>When was the bar lowered?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not bad but terribly overrated drama. Seems like these days every movie that is halfway good is over-hyped and hailed as a masterpiece. I don't know when it happened but at some point in the last decade or so the bar was lowered. Now every moderately good film is lumped in with the greatest of all time. I'm no racing fan but I have enjoyed racing films before. Rush is overlong and doesn't build to anything really. The ending, or more to the point the last half hour, felt like a story searching for a powerful finish that it never found. I know this is based on real people and events, but I fail to see how that matters in the context of judging how they told the story. A dramatic film is not a documentary and artistic license is acceptable and, in many cases, desperately needed. What it comes down to is that this is a middle-of-the-road drama. Nothing exceptional and certainly nothing new. The performances are adequate, but nothing to rave about. The story, real or not, is fractured and lacking in any sense of a point in the end. I felt like I learned nothing of significance about the two men that the film focuses on. This is particularly true for James Hunt, portrayed by Chris Hemsworth. Other than being a walking cliché, what else was there to the man? The film has no answers. It has few more for Daniel Bruhl's Niki Lauda. Perhaps if they had chosen to focus on just one of the men rather than both, they could have told a more interesting story. As it is, it's a superficial drama about two men with unimpressive racing footage sprinkled throughout.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Quite A Rush</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is much to like here, mostly the performance of the main character. There was however a technical issue with the crazy editing, which left me dizzy and confused about what some perceive as action versus razzle dazzle. In essence, the film explores what the world of car racing offers anyone who participates of its thrills. As the audience, we are witnesses to the speed, the car designs, the sudden arrival of tragedy. The film goes in deeper and looks at how the drivers become enamored of the rush, and what what would be the ultimate goal.There are two young man who challenge each other to be the best. Each has his own personal agenda and constantly tries to do outdo the other, sometimes, defying family and conventions. It is easy to admire one but not quite like him. It is fascinating how the other can throw a spell on us in minutes. Once they are behind the wheel, they are not that different from each other. They both mortal and vulnerable and liable to have each race be their last. One scene in particular shows a fan being honest as he request that an autograph be signed, just in case...There are emotional moments in the movie, as one of the stars is involved in a fiery crash which could mean the end of his career, and this experience is an epiphany for both leads, as one discovers his own strengths and the other, for a moment, steps back and recognizes the best in both. In the end, both learn to appreciate what is really important, and the final race of the movie is a testament to both courage and stupidity because there is no other reason to have that to placate people's greed and morbid instincts.It is a pity this film shows up the same week "Prisoners" come out which shows a heart stopping race to a hospital in a crucial scene of the movie. The editing there is superb, where in "Rush", we rarely get more than three seconds of the camera focusing on the intense moments we are supposed to witness. Thank God for the actors, the costume design, and the technical aspects here. It is a faithful depiction of the world of the 70's, its decadent culture, and the world of racing. Unfortunately it is presented as if we were in the middle of a twister because it is hard to stay focused on an object, a person, or catch that rush that should be an essential part of this experience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mix between the fast and furious and a Chris Hemsworth suckfest</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When this movie hit theatres in 2013 Chris Hemsworth was the talk of the town and every casting agent in Hollywood was dying to cast Hemsworth into every role possible whether he fitted the character or not. Hemsworth was carrying 50lbs of muscle in his upcoming role for Troy (a few months later) it was if they dragged a blonde bodybuilder onto the set to play Hunt. The movie itself wasn't awful but it reminded me of a formula one adaptation of the fast and furious. Insert cheesy quote here, followed by a gear change here and finally a cut shot to the engine. Got it? Brilliant! If you're a fan of formula one or realistic portrayals of historical characters give this movie a skip. If your a mindless idiot who likes the fast and furious, grab some cheetos and prepare to be entertained.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nein! Twenty percent risk, no more!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based loosely on a true story, Ron Howard's "Rush" charts the rivalry between James Hunt (Chris Hemsworth) and Niki Lauda (Daniel Bruhl), a pair of Formula One drivers. Hunt's a risk-taking womaniser, Niki's a cautious Austrian, personal qualities which Howard conveys via sledgehammer.Though slick and exciting, and though it features a likeably eccentric performance by Bruhl, "Rush" is mostly an assemblage of clichés. It climaxes with Hunt and Lauda begrudgingly admitting mutual respect. Shot on a zillion dollar budget, this cartoon for the console generation finds Howard a long way away from his Roger Corman produced car flick, "Grand Theft Auto".6/10 ? Worth one viewing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A solid movie but nothing special</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's no match for 'Senna', the absorbing documentary that made me, for the first time ever, interested in motor racing (for the duration of the movie, anyway), but 'Rush' is enjoyable enough in a Ron Howard kind of way. It's bright and colourful and looks thoroughly artificial, and it's bolted together in Ron's usual workmanlike fashion, like a sturdy chair or a table that doesn't wobble. The movie centres around the rivalry between 1970s racing giants James Hunt and Niki Lauda, played here by Chris Hemsworth and Daniel Brühl. Hunt is popular, charming and a right slag; Lauda is cold, arrogant and disciplined, and so they clash on and off the track. It's a subject that I would have been more interested in as a documentary, I think, but the two central performances are pretty good, Hemsworth being his usual charismatic self and Brühl impressing with a performance that's far more shaded. Howard and scriptwriter Peter Morgan check off the events efficiently, breezing through the movie in a way that makes it not unpleasant to watch but nothing like as engaging as it needs to be; for most of the film there's no sense of the passion and energy that should be present. The races are chopped up into brief montages announced by captions that are on and off the screen before there's time to take them in. The rush of the title is nowhere to be seen. Until, that is, the big accident, at which point the movie suddenly becomes gripping and emotional for half an hour or so. This stretch is operating on a level far above the rest of the film and it's a shame that the whole thing can't match it. Ah well. It's a solid film that zooms in and out of the memory without stopping.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Niki Lauda story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In many ways this reminded me of those biopics that were made in the early 1950s. An undercurrent of fact mixed with a large dose of hogwash. The reality of the Hunt vs Lauda battle was a cracking story and I remember following it at the time, but most of the film left me cold - possibly because of a truly abysmal portrayal of James Hunt, but also the rather paltry amount of awfully CGI track action and the fact that every facet of the story was portrayed in a very naff stereotypical fashion. In fact were it not for a masterful performance by Daniel Brühl who really does capture some of the essence of Niki Lauda, I'd have probably scored the film a couple of points lower. I was hoping this would be a racing film that might finally outshine Grand Prix, instead, its really only slightly more watchable than Bobby Deerfield.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Watched this film last night and was a bit disappointed compared to the Senna film. There was too much romance and I didn't think Chris Hemsworth made a good James Hunt. We watched a recent documentary about the relationship between Lauda and Hunt that was much more interesting and I believe (having met them both personally) closer to the truth. It would have better with more original footage and covered the relationship with the team more at an engineering level. Having said that the intensity and 110% commitment from F1 drivers cam across very well and the dismissal of the risk was shown well. The scenes of Lauda's recovery were quite shocking as I am sure they really were. Still I give it 7 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Rush is a well acted, directed movie with a great story. Helmsworth has a strong performance as a Flamboyant race car driver. Ron Howard, directs a perfect story of the clashing professional race car drivers Hunt and Lauda. Hunt is a reckless and flamboyant personality, while Lauda has an arrogant and anal retentive personality. The personality clash creates an intense rivalry. (The irony of the story is both characters have huge egos,push limits and left wealthy families with promising futures.) Each action of Hunt and Lauda pushes the other driver to be better. The crux of Rush's story is an accident and how the two main characters react to the horrific event. The pressure of racing is the minor part of the movie! The real story is about people and how their personalities interact.</fullReview>

I remember it well from childhood, being interested in cars and racing at the time.Rush lacks depth. The acting is shallow and underdeveloped.The seventies setting is also rather unconvincing.Perhaps it is that I don't dig the direction of today, and unfamiliar with the current stars.Rush feels to me more as a soap opera or something.Quite surprising that it is rated 8,2 as an average here at IMDb.</fullReview>

Again, we find ourselves before a biopic which totally disregards the historic facts and actual events.

And what about the final drama of finishing fifth when actually finishing third? Screen players dramatic touch, but in my opinion out of the line in a biopic.Entertaining, but as usual in Hollywood movies, inaccurate... therefore worth a 6.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There was a good amount of promotion for this film before it was released, including its director Ron Howard (Apollo 13, A Beautiful Mind, The Da Vinci Code, Frost/Nixon) appearing on Top Gear to do Star in the Reasonably Priced Car, I was definitely up for a true story film about racing. Basically young and brash Briton James Hunt (Thor's Chris Hemsworth) and cool and calculating Austrian Niki Lauda (Inglourious Basterds' Daniel Brühl) are highly skilled racing drivers who developed a strong rivalry during their time in Formula Three, and they soon enough buy their way into Formula One, Lauda joining Ferrari and Hunt joining McLaren. While they are preparing for the big leagues with their new cars and sponsorships, Hunt gets married to supermodel Suzy Miller (Olivia Wilde), while Lauda starts a relationship with socialite Marlene Knaus (Alexandra Maria Lara), and the two racers meet each other on the track for the 1976 Formula One season. Lauda dominates and wins the first two races while Hunt struggles to beat him or be in good place, and the Spanish Grand Prix he does win he is disqualified for his car being too wide, and more problems arise when he does not stick to the rules of Formula One, and he finds out Suzy has been having a relationship with actor Richard Burton. Following the divorce from his wife Hunt gains his competitive spirit back, and the disqualification from Spain is overturned, so his points are reinstated and he is still in the running for the championship, and meanwhile in a private ceremony Lauda marries Marlene, but he worries the marriage has effects on his racing skill. At the German Grand Prix the race is threatened by heavy rain, causing the track to be dangerous to drive on, Lauda insists that the race should be cancelled, but he is overruled by Hunt and the other racers who convince the F1 committee he is worried of losing his points, the race goes on with the rain pouring, and it is halfway through that disaster occurs, when Lauda's breaks fails and his car crashes violently into the embankment, catching fire, and other cars crashing into it. Lauda is pulled out of the wreckage and suffers third degree burns to his face and toxic fumes in his lungs, for six weeks he is treated for his severe injuries, and while this happens he watches on television as Hunt wins many races and gains many points, and against doctor's wishes he returns for the Italian Grand Prix to race, he comes fourth place, while Hunt fails to finish the race. The 1976 championship is coming to its climax, with Japanese Grand Prix, where it is again rainy, and Hunt is only three points behind Lauda and can only win the championship if he comes third or higher, in the second lap Lauda opts out and returns to Marlene, explaining he will not risk his life, while Hunt continues, and after the final lap he is eventually positioned third place and beats Lauda by just one point, and he wins the 1976 Formula One season trophy. For the next year Hunt enjoys the lifestyle as a winner and all that fame has to offer, money, sex and drugs, while Lauda starts learning how to fly planes, they meet each other at an airfield, Hunt confesses that having won a championship he has nothing to prove, he continues to race until his retirement in 1979, becoming a commentator for motorsport broadcasts, he died in 1993 aged forty five from a heart attack, while Lauda retired in 1985 and now runs airlines and does commentary. Also starring Pierfrancesco Favino as Clay Regazzoni, Me and Orson Welles's Christian McKay as Lord Alexander Hesketh, Stephen Mangan as Alastair Caldwell, Green Wing's Julian Rhind-Tutt as Anthony 'Bubbles' Horsley, Alistair Petrie as Stirling Moss, Natalie Dormer as Nurse Gemma, Patrick Baladi as John Hogan, Joséphine De La Baume as Agnes Bonnet and Kristofer Dayne as Mario Andretti. Hemsworth is a perfect choice as "Hunt the Shunt" being swaggering and determined, but also thoughtful, and Brühl is equally perfect as "The Rat" being tactical and nerdy, and scowling a lot, the direction by Howard is well paced, with fast paced action during the sometimes dangerous and high- octane races, and a good script for the slower bits, a thrilling and thoughtful biographical drama. Very good!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another good Ron Howard movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When you think Ron Howard, you think Richie, obviously; and then you think blockbusters. He's made a quite a few of them. Apollo 13, A Beautiful Mind, Frost/Nixon, Cocoon; and those are just the films that I like. Pretty much all of his films are commercial and/or critical successes, and every new film is met with a lot of hype and fanfare. We can now add Rush to that list of blockbusters.For those that don't know, Rush is the true story of James Hunt and Niki Lauda, Formula 1 drivers in the 1970s. The two men were at the top of their game, which led to a very personal and merciless rivalry both on and off the track.Rush follows the same pattern that all of Ron Howard's films seem to, which, considering his track record, is probably a good thing. The main similarity is the very strong story, and Rush has a fantastic one. The rivalry between Lauda and Hunt was a vicious one, with incidents that arguably could only have been the stuff of fiction. The fact that it's all true is incredible, and you don't need to be a racing fan to appreciate it. Another similarity. Like with Apollo 13 and Frost/Nixon, Howard is able to take a subject with a niche interest and make it appeal to the masses.In Chris Hemsworth and Daniel Bruhl, we are also witness to two very good performances. If you've seen Inglorious Basterds, then you probably already know that Bruhl is a very good actor; and here, he's excellent as the cold, boring Lauda. The real star, though, is Hemsworth. After a filmography that includes superhero and horror movies, this might be seen his breakthrough as a serious actor. It was very impressive. The supporting cast were decent enough, but nobody else really stands out beyond the top two. What was nice to see is Green Wing alumni Stephen Mangan and Julian Rhind-Tutt make appearances. But, at the end of the day, you're watching the movie for the two leads, and they're very good.Here's the problem, though. As good as the story is, and as good as the actors and the performances are, Rush falls down where so many of his films have done. The script. They're not awful, don't get me wrong ? his films wouldn't be successful if the scripts were horrendous. The problem with the scripts are that they're overly sentimental and, at times, very cheesy. It really gets a little hard to watch when the stuff being said is so full of exposition.However, if you're happy to forgive the filmmakers for that (and most audiences seem to), then you're still really going to enjoy this movie. Despite the subject matter, it manages to balance a good amount of humour and drama. Add in some excellent performances, and you've got a fun film to watch.This will never go down as one of Ron Howard's best movies, and he won't win any awards for it probably, but it's a great effort. Give it a look.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not the Definitive Racing Movie, But Zips Along.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was energised by the reviews for this seemingly out-of-water subject for director Ron Howard. Especially the talk of the technical advancement of small cameras that can give you a microscopic glimpse of the physics at play when racing a formula 1 car. I was almost stunned at how cliché sounding the exposition was in the first act. I thought, OK it starts out by-the-numbers, but it will finish off a winner (can't help with the racing analogies). I was disappointed how little racing footage was shown. I have yet to see a properly made movie about the drama that occurs on the track during a race. I don't know why directors claim that watching racing is boring. We get glimpses of the forces at hand as the camera is jerked around when attached to the car. I suppose ultimately they are afraid to spend the money to make such action scenes.It was made clear in the reviews that this was not a film about racing, but about two prominent characters from the racing world. With the 70s period being depicted, it's almost like "Forrest Gump" or something as we relive 1976. I was also feeling kind of trapped in the script that insists on keeping the story factual. The movie spends a great deal of time on relationships, and exploring what their relationships are about. But I felt their was too much time in sacrifice for good old racing footage for the touchy feely stuff.If there was any talk of Oscars, the only one I would consider is Daniel Bruhl for lead actor. That is kind of strange that the marketing features Chris Hemsworth, despite the striking persona Niki Lauda displays as a major component to this film. Worth noting is the careful balance of action, tech talk, and marital relations the script adheres to. Such as a major race being shown through the wife watching it on TV.I enjoy racing movies sometimes, but not when it really isn't about racing. This movie spends less than half the time on racing, and the rest doesn't resonate in an award winning way. Despite my cynicism about this imbalance, there were certainly some poignant quotes that made me think. So credit that to the screenplay. As for director Ron Howard, the only sense of his style that helps perhaps is the pacing. He keeps the momentum going, deliberately sacrificing a beat or two that would normally allow a heavy moment to sink in. For this film it works, because it represents how shallow the main characters are. My final verdict is that it is a watchable movie, but still is not the definitive racing movie. I would wait for the DVD</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ron Howard's handsomely-staged drama unfolds in the pit lanes, plush homes, and smoky offices of the Formula 1 world of the mid-1970s. A period biopic, it has a similar look and feel to Tom Hooper's The Damned United, and while it also shares a writer (Peter Morgan), this film isn't buoyed by the same standard of cast.The story concerns the rivalry between Englishman James Hunt (Chris Hemsworth) and Niki Lauda (Daniel Bruhl) as they work (or buy) their way up from Formula 3 and compete for the 1976 World Championship. When a film is based on real events, professional critics have a habit of giving away the entire plot, as if we should already be aware of every twist and turn. Ignorance is bliss, as far as this non-professional is concerned, so all I'll say is that there are crashes and squeals on and off the track, and the Championship goes down to the wire.Some things about Rush are very good. Anthony Dod Mantle's cinematography is pristinely flashy and grimy in the right measures. Hans Zimmer's score is suitably stirring - and suitably drowned out by the excellent sound design. The performances are all solid.The problems are with the script, whose dialogue can be lousy at times; really clunky and by-the-numbers. Ron Howard works with workmanlike efficiency, concentrating on moving the plot onward, but never allowing a scene to breathe, perhaps for fear our attention won't hold before the next engine roar. I would rather have seen a tighter focus on fewer characters, and got more involved in Lauda's unusual relationship with his wife (Alexandra Maria Lara, making the most of a virtually silent role). The psychology of those who dance with death for a living is referred to without being explored.So we're left with a swift, visceral, formulaic page-turner - one that's worth a watch, for non-drivers and petrolheads alike.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>fast cars, interesting rivalry</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't care for car racing and know nothing about Formula 1, but I thought this movie was OK. There were lots of race scenes and they were shot well. It gave the feeling of seeing these cars race at hundreds of miles per hour plus you got a feel of what it was like from the driver point of view.So the film is about a rivalry between 2 guys that first met at Formula 3 races. Then they move up to the big time, and are in a heated battle for the most points. Lauda is the more serious and trying to get points taken away for breaking rules. Hunt is the party boy whom is competitive and more lax. During the racing season, Lauda gets hurt and brings drama as this lets Hunt get back in the race for point leader. Lauda has already one the top spot before, so Hunt has real drive and risks his life to win.There is also a little about each drivers' wife and how their personal relationships functioned.FINAL VERDICT: The acting isn't too great, but the racing scenes are. Plus Chris Hemsworth is very good looking in this. So if you like fast cars, check it out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A technical marvel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When Oscar nominations were announced this year many bemoaned the lack of Rush in any of the categories with Ron Howards FI biopic not even able to score a look in in any of the seemingly appropriate tech or sound spots. It's a curious and unanswerable question when one is to ask why Rush was so overlooked, but it's also not hard to see why the film was perhaps just merely forgotten about.Rush is a film that from a production stand point would be graded in the highest order yet there is an element amiss in the film that stops it from being an emotional movie, a movie that transcends whatever scene it is set in and gets viewers to appreciate it on a whole different wave length. The sound editing, visual effects, stunts and Anthony Dod Mantle's at times ground breaking and stunning cinematography (after this effort and his work on films such as 127 Hours and Dredd 3D Mantle is quickly establishing himself as one of the best in the DOP game) in Rush are without question A grade efforts but Howard has somehow miss?stepped when concentrating on the lives of these two different and amazingly driven men.In one of his first lead roles outside of the Marvel universe Hemsworth as playboy James Hunt is a solid presence in the film but one can't help but feel it's pretty much Thor in a fast car and therefore not much of a stretch of his acting ability. Daniel Bruhl as the much more stoic and professional of the two racers Niki Lauda does a fine job of portraying a man that at times is extremely hard to care for and that's where the film becomes an enjoyable one not a classic. These two true life men lead undeniably interesting lives and the focus of the events in the film are at times edge of your set moments but to transcend a film to another level (and get those Oscar nominations) you need to have people that no matter how vile or arrogant they get they still draw your feelings out, and James and Niki sadly just don't have that.A never dull and visually impressive piece of movie entertainment Rush is another fine entry into the increasingly broad film catalogue of director Ron Howard who is one of the most consistent and interesting directors working today. Rush is also a film that could have been so much more but as it stands is a thoroughly entertaining and enjoyable night in with a movie, just don't expect to be thinking about it in the days following.3 and a half lung cleanouts out of 5 For more movie reviews and opinions check out - www.jordanandeddie.wordpress.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too fast to tell a story properly</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Another movie in a series I've seen lately that I didn't like. It almost looks like some trend in Hollywood movies these days: start promising an interesting story, even develop it up to a point (careful! not too deep!) and the end abruptly and leave the viewer with a bunch of question marks above the head (I believe the proper expressing for this is "wtf?!). So, the story was promising (getting into deep dungeons of friendship/rivalry/antagonisms of main characters) but it ended up wandering around almost random scenes from their lives and ending ,as usual, just when it becomes interesting. Now something on the "technical aspects of the craft": Cast is very good and so are the performances (two main characters only), as well as editing. The direction can be described as "somewhat too nervous and erratic", probably following the script. There were some good ideas but, unfortunately, not developed properly. As if producers said: no money for a second more. Too bad. It could have been a really good movie. But it isn't.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Don't go to men who are willing to kill themselves driving around in circles looking for normality." During the 1970's Formula 1 racing was hugely popular. Two of the most popular drivers at that time were James Hunt (Hemsworth)and Niki Lauda (Brühl). They were instant rivals and personal enemies. During the 1976 season the rivalry hit its peak and the two found themselves neck and neck for the world championship. When Niki is involved in an horrific accident the two realize what they mean to each other. I was a little hesitant about watching this going in for a few reasons. I am not a racing fan nor am I a fan of racing movies. I wasn't a big fan of Days Of Thunder...so that is my disclaimer. As far as this movie goes it was better then I was expecting but I never really felt a connection with any of the people and when the accident happened it didn't really have any affect on me. Days Of Thunder did have more of a rivalry feel to it and played that up. This one focused more on each driver individually more then the racing rivalry. When you watch it you will know what I mean. Overall, the movie was better then I expected but was really missing something to cause the necessary emotions. I give this a B-.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After all the positive reviews and high scores for this movie, I expected a lot more. First half (that would be one hour) of the movie is particularly bad, painting main protagonists as one-dimensional characters and skipping through events with music video editing style and pace. Only after first hour we get first proper race action, and we only get one more at the end of the movie. It's OK, does it job of kicking movie in the higher gear, but it looks to "modern" for my tastes. That means, too unnatural and "assisted", with extra bright and vivid colors. I guess in theater sound does help in creating the atmosphere, but watching at home you won't smell the tires burning.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Film Shame about Chris Hemsworth</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film about the rivalry between James Hunt and Nikki Lauda follows the BBC documentary Hunt v Lauda about the 1976 Formula 1 World Cup. This had to be a fabulous basis for a film because of the real life twists and turns which actually occurred leading up to the final showdown in the last race of the season in Japan. I advise anyone to catch that documentary if they can as it is pretty thrilling and gives lots of vox pop from those who were there. Back to the film though, it's very good and the action sequences are pretty phenomenal, everything to keep any petrol head, 14 year old boy or even his giddy girlfriend on the edge of the seat. Daniel Bruhl is a great Nikki Lauda, all serious and autistic. Alexandra Maria Lara is uncanny as his graceful and dignified wife. The only weakness in the film is the casting of Chris Hemsworth. He manages to look the part but never really captures the essence of Hunt who was far more complex than given credit in the film. He also can't manage Hunts witticisms and if you YouTube James Hunt, you will find that the real James's delivery is much funnier and more droll. Advice to Hemsworth, stick to the beefcake roles. Go see the movie at the cinema as the race scenes are better there</fullReview>

Even the driving scenes seemed unbelievable to me particularly the long shots down every start/finish straight - for some reason they all looked completely unreal and that is on my tiny telly, goodness knows what they looked like on the big screen. I had little idea what was going on. Someone crashes "who is that?" asks my Mrs, "I've no idea" I say. Oh, and one other thing that drove me to distraction was the totally invasive and somewhat condescending 'commentary' on every race - ugh! This is (another) of those films I am heartily glad I didn't part with any money to see. I don't know who would have done a better James Hunt but there must have been someone??? 10/10 for Nikki, 0/10 for everything else (Except the six-wheeler Tyrell - I loved seeing that!)

		<fullReview>the movie could have been better. there are many reviews here which talk about + of the movie, so let me just talk about what the movie is missing. the movie is liking watching a documentary or a quick summary of the results of all the races took place between Niki and James. character build up, there is nothing about the background of the two character. In one scene Niki's dad says he don't want him to race and thats the end of it. where did Niki got love and talent for racing, we don't know. where did he became such an expert on cars, we don't know.James, how did a drunk playboy become the best driver out there, we don't know. who trained him or did he just woke up drunk and said, f**k yeah i will drive the car in the best car race ever and win the title.Niki goes through s**t accident and he is back on race, which is total madness, nothing been said what was that, which motivated him to take such pain and come back. Sure, he had love for race, but the pain and the level of accident he went through was so big and it was not well justified.other then James and Niki, all other characters are under developed. there is nothing romantic in the film. both James and Niki meet some hot random chick and they are married or in love in next and nothing has been shown the marriage or personal life of two character. Olivia Wilde goes on a ski trip and ends with another man, only 1 scene was shown to reflect the difference between a married couple. heck married couple have 10 fights every day, and that was not even a fight.at the end, i felt like i was watching two racers competing for something. not much detail was given why 2.3 second is so critical when in everyday life we don't even think about 2.3 second. i agree in race every second counts, but how the 2.3 second was such a moving number. so, in the end if you know James and Niki, know all about F1 race, and wanted to see quick summary of their race life from that era, this is good movie. if you want to know them, what bring them to racing ground and why they were ready to put their life or why they were better then 10 other drivers on the ground, then in my case i had to go and read Wiki article on them. good luck for yours.</fullReview>

Then I watched a recent Indy car race on TV and was swept away by the much better camera work and amazing wreck footage.

Or Perhaps More Accurately a Biopic of Formula One Drivers Jimmy Hunt and Niki Lauda and Their 1976 Competition for the World Championship.

Just in Case You weren't Paying Attention or were Drifting Thinking about Something Else, Anything Else, Perhaps PlayStation or XBox.This is what Passes as Great Filmmaking or Storytelling? Oh Yea, its an Intense Tale of Superstar Rivalry but the Movie is Never Intense. It just sort of Stays Parked. When it does Creep Off the Starting Line it Rolls Along at about the Speed of a Sunday Drive.Boring, Restrained, Common, and Formula Film of a Motor Sport that Most People have Very Little Knowledge and After Watching this will Know just about the Same. It is Hardly Informative, Barely Entertaining, and is a Mega-Budgeted Movie from an Award Winning Director that is Extremely Overrated. Never Once does the Rivalry Seem Powerful and On the Edge. Odd Considering the Film Makes a Heavy Handed Attempt to Show that the Drivers who Participate in this Type of Death Defying Daring-Do are Next to Insane and Alpha-Male Maniacs that are Thrill Seekers Extraordinaire. If You are Seeking Thrills Don't Expect it Here. Average at Best and Humdrum at Worst.</fullReview>

They don't add those, maybe the reason might be to achieve the optimal speed and making the vehicle more aerodynamically stable. In that case, they could have added something like "HELMET VISOR WIPERS" .... this should give a sufficient vision to the drivers and enable them to utilize their potential to the fullestBravo Director !!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's been a while since Ron Howard's first theatrically released motion picture as a director. That was the Roger Corman produced/low-budget cult flick GRAND THEFT AUTO. And now he's returned to speeding cars but a lot more seriously, and it's a true story.RUSH centers on the rivalry between two racers who could not be more different, yet both share a heavy dose of navel-gazing narcissism...Chris Hemsworth plays James Hunt with the kind of polarizing, unapologetic devil-may-care attitude that makes it nearly impossible to root for the man. With so much confidence and so many girlfriends, why does he need our support? Other than vomiting before each race, he's more of a... well... superhero than human being. And then there's the not so perfect looking fella who's more professionally in-tuned to the racing life. Enter Daniel Brühl's Nicki Lauda, with a chip on his shoulder the size of Hunt's nighttime libido.Ron Howard has made a grungy biopic with a realistic, no-nonsense aura but something is missing. While we learn from the start that Lauda is the best in the world, and Hunt is right behind with more hunger to surpass the man he describes several times as a "rat," we never learn enough about either, deep down, to make their stint on the rip-roaring Indy 500, composed of a year-long globe-spanning circuit shown in speedy montage sequences, really matter.</fullReview>

For the most part, the film is proficiently acted and directed; an effective, generically crafted sports drama. My impression, however, is that there is surely some integral material that just didn't make the final cut (for whatever reasons). The most striking thought I had at the conclusion of this film is that it is almost entirely devoid of any character development. These characters are there, they're racing fools, and that's apparently enough motivation for all of the story's players. The story never really penetrates any real emotional depth. And that's okay, I don't want to complain because the movie is not the one I wanted to see nor is it the one I would have made.

		<fullReview>5.1 of 10. It's as if they're trying to make this the Semi-Tough (1977) with a little Brian's Story of racing films. Stylistically, it's impressive. Howard clearly has a passion for sports competition and wants to make a film comparable to the best sports films. In that, he succeeds. Beyond that, it's little more than typical sports propaganda, complete with product placement as if the film itself sold out ad space.It's clearly designed to promote racing and persuade some to become fans and racers, trying to make it seem like a sexy outlet for rule breakers and full of something other than physically talented morons sniffing too many fuel fumes. The screenwriter and Howard do that by giving the characters more depth and faults than usual.Amongst other failures, the Formula 1 scoring system is never explained, so it feels as if there's some sort of back-room manipulation going on like in "pro" wrestling. That and the leader board mishaps might make for a more interesting story.Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby is still the racing, and maybe all sports, film of choice.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great directing, acting, cinematography for an average story.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The best thing about this flick is Ron Howard's directing, editing,cinematography,special effects and the soundtrack. I grew up in the 70's and it seemed like 1976 all over again. The fast cars and loud engines almost shake you in your seat and that alone makes for a good movie. The racetrack scenes showing the rain pouring down makes you feel something out of The Lord of the Rings. Now, the story line and driver rivalry seemed a bit average and not necessary entertaining. In fact it appears almost made up in parts and over exaggerated just to add some entertainment. But overall this is a typical racing flick from 1976 with updated technology for 2013.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Racing movie without race</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Screenplay was really bad written. I do understand there was a lot of events to tell and in different times but the transition of time just didn't work.Very choppy. Besides this is a Racing Movie there was no racing excitement happening until just before the end of second Act. Characters personality were very shallow, they tried hard to define it but just didn't work. Niki Lauda German accent was way too strong which was very annoying and sometimes even hard to understand. Color Grading Vignette was overused and pull you out of the story instead of drag you in. Even though was directed by Ron Howard who is Academy Award winner it just didn't work for me at all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Decent Movie but falls short of greatness</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went to the screening of Rush with high hopes after what i found were Rave Reviews of the Movie.No Doubt, the movie is decent solid watch, but falls short of being a classic or worthy of an Oscar nomination as claimed by many.Mild Spoilers ahead.As we know by now the story revolves around the rivalry between the Brit James Hunt and the Austrian Niki Lauda with emphasis on the 1976 season. The plot is pretty straight forward and inspired by the true events portrayed authentically.The story moves at decent pace and i also kind of liked the way the season is depicted race by race in a tight gritty manner. Technically the film is good, visually authentic, with decent film editing and good cinematography.However, what seriously limits the film is mediocre dialog, and the lack of an emotional connect to the characters. The women and pretty much the entire cast have precious little to do both in terms of dialog or impact.Chris and Daniel are good in their roles but at some level fail to make us deeply care about them. They do of course have their moments but they are few and far between.If you are an avid F1 fan like me, you d be aware of how, much up to the 70's (hell even 90's till senna's death)F1 was a very dangerous sport with few security regulations, high risk tracks and an indifferent FIA. The film touches on these themes, but alas, fails to draw the kind of emotions/empathy for the drivers.So, all in all a good film which could have been so much more :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rushed to leave the theater.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Trust me I am the biggest Ron Howard fan and I went into this movie with nothing but pure excitement and high expectations. Maybe that is what I did wrong, expecting the usual Ron Howard film, but I was sadly disappointed with his work on this one. I will be the first to let you know a good movie from the next and I am really surprised with all the high ratings for this movie, but I was very disappointed with this one. Yes, you get great shots from the drivers perspective, okay racing scenes, decent character development, but not your leave the theater in deep thought and feeling like I took something with me from the theater like mostly all Ron Howard films. I actually saved the ticked stub right after I purchased it as a kind of memento to say I saw this film in the theaters, maybe 20 years down the road, but I actually threw this stub away in major disappointment that I Just spent 11.50 for this movie. yes, the plot is there, and I understand its a true story between these 2 racers, but this should have made it even more excellent of a movie that Ron Howard takes on. I should have known when I saw three other companies that were part producers of this movie besides Imagine, that right there should of shown that Ron didn't have full say when it came down to certain decisions. Has Ron finally sold out for money, instead of great film. It seems that way, and I have lost a lot of respect from him from this film he just put out. I had a feeling since I haven't heard much about this movie from the word of mouth movie chatter that I normally pick up on, I thought maybe it was because everyone has broken bad and that is all there was to talk about, but I see now that I couldn't even be excited to start a conversation or be involved excitedly to discuss this movie with friends or family. I gave it 6 and that's pretty good just based on the okay visuals you get and how hard it is to shoot fast driving scenes. Say it ain't so Ron, is this what we should be expecting from here on out. What is with all the other partnering companies we saw with your Iconic IMAGINE company in the beginning of the film? Remember when we use to see just that one single IMAGINE logo before all of your other movies and there we knew we were in for a great one? Im not sure where these other band wagon companies came from but please just make sure your next movie is from IMAGINE alone or I can Imagine Ron Howard losing all his credibility for great movie making.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An unbearable succession of clichés</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>...again, this movie is an unbearable succession of clichés! Rarely have I seen such an artificial mindless plot. This peace of work is by all means unworthy of representing the lives of these famous names in F1. And the costly technical arrangements do not compensate for this unforgivable lack. What a waste of resources...! I am wondering why these talented actors and filmmakers got involved with this script in the first place. And I am also wondering why Nikki Lauda, the protagonist of the story, gave his blessing to the use of his name and his certainly impressive life story. A mystery to me. However, the bad monetary performance of the movie speaks for itself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The power of vanity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have never been a fun of formula 1 racing and this movie confirmed my impressions that there is no point in a sport that is inherently dangerous, has cost lives of several drivers and offers very little in terms of spectacle.Usually, I would not share my views on a sport unless I deemed it relevant but the protagonists of this film are partakers of the risky side of this sport where due to lack of alternative channels for their testosterone are prepared to die in every single race. Everything else comes second and is random.In all fairness, Ron Howard puts on the front seat of the lives of two legendary champions where we see their ups and downs, not to mention their gigantic vanity where their personal rivalry pushed one another to succeed even more.An interesting character study combined with edge of your seat action and the audience will be treated to some serious adrenaline rush.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rush? Hmmm, not sure you should actually</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's much to admire in Ron Howard's biopic of the battle between Niki Lauda (Daniel Bruhl) and James Hunt (Chris Hemsworth), not least both actors' portrayals of the leads and Howard's, at times, brilliant action sequences. Sad to say though there's a lot that simply doesn't work.Act 1 (the set up - early years) has moments of cringeworthy scripting and acting with little that engages (in fact I found myself wishing it was all over).Act 2 (the action sequences when 1976 is dramatically recreated, race by race) is mostly enthralling and really brings together all that is good about this movie (Bruhl, Hemsworth and Howard's direction).Act 3 (the denouement) is a missed opportunity. It's desperately rushed - despite its two hour length. I suspect an order from the studio to cut the timelength came into play with the consequence that it feels like an afterthought.What makes Rush worth seeing is the most important aspect of the movie, the bitter rivalry between Lauda and Hunt. Both actors uncannily capture the drivers' individual personalities but the script by The Queen writer Peter Morgan sometimes leaves them with nowhere to go, at others it dazzles, "You're the only man that is better looking after skin grafts" quips Hunt to Lauda in Act 3; and Lauda's repeated statement that a 20% risk of death in each race is all that's acceptable is used well and resonates.It's the supporting actors that lets it down; an unconvincing Murray Walker, an unlikeable Lord Hesketh, Hunt's wife - all fail to convince. Only Alexandra Maria Lara, as Lauda's wife, strikes a real chord. At $38million this is a big budget movie for the UK. Its ambitions are clear to see. Just a shame the whole doesn't amount to more than the sum of its variable parts.Want to see a great motor racing movie?(There's very few of merit and despite my reservations this one's definitely among the elite.) Watch Senna.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not really intended for petrol heads.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am quite a big F1 fan and well acquainted with the Niki Lauda/James Hunt story, so I have been looking forward to seeing this film for quite some time. Overall I was quite shocked about how real to life the film was. However it does cater more to the mass market then petrol heads. The film places a huge emphasis on the drivers and their lives with very little of the actual driving itself (in-fact many of the races are just a quick drive by with the result written over it) and it does overplay this a bit too much for my liking.However the film as a whole is quite gripping and even if you know the story well, there is enough to keep you on the edge of your seat. It goes to great lengths to show just how dangerous the sport was back then and how the drivers diced with death each and every time they got behind the wheel. However be prepared to watch a film that unfortunately places most of it's emphasis (way too much in my opinion) on the sex, drinking and drugs.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than Driven!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As Hollywood recreations of real events go, this is not too bad. Of course liberties have been taken with the facts, but this is inevitable when the events of several years are compressed into a couple of hours. The recreation of racing in the seventies is generally well done but for those who lived through the 1976 season the movie lacks dramatic impact. Hemsworth and Bruhl do a good job as Hunt and Lauda, but the other roles are virtually bit parts. The portrayal of BRM's Louis Stanley (a notorious tyrant) is particularly poor. If you know nothing of seventies racing you may enjoy it, but if you are not a racing fan it probably has little to offer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great disappointment/ rent the 1966 "Grand Prix"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The hype for this film belies the second rate racing sequences, especially the claim that one would feel as if he or she were in the cockpit of an F1 car. If you are interested in F!, I suggest that in lieu of wasting money on this film, one should either rent or buy the 1966 movie Grand Prix. That film brilliantly presented the thrill and drama of F1 in all its glory, excitement and tragedy. Grand Prix's story line is generally considered rather weak but that is a very small concession for it incredible racing sequences. John Frankenheimer was an extraordinary director who visually captured the excitement of open cockpit racing in what was truly its golden era. Ron Howard on the other hand uses a combination of slapdash racing sequences and optical effects which fail, in my estimation, to truly convey the stunning excitement of this incredible sport.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Extremely fast race cars ............</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>............. in a super slow movie!There are a lot of reviews here so this review is to the point. Skip the first 40 to 45 minutes. At that point there is some great racing footage and an actual feeling of excitement. And you will not be lost in the plot line.From there on you can skip 'the incident' and jump to more racing or just finish this predictable flick.The rivalry between Hunt and Lauder is easy to keep up with and figure out its conclusion long before the end of the movie. Its two hours of movie which could easily have much more editing to shorten it because when its over it was all much ado about nothing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Twice.After 45 min into it, there was about 5 minutes of actual racing. Went to the restroom, ran into a friend, spoke with him for about 15 minutes. Came back to my seat and asked my wife...."What I miss?" Her: "Absolutely nothing." They went back and forth some more about who had a bigger attitude, and who was the better driver and then I fell asleep. Wife woke me up to see the last (and apparently only) race. Fairly expensive nap.Worst Ron Howard film I have had the opportunity to miss. I never fall asleep in movies, but this was nap material.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was so bored the first 45 minutes! It was SO SLOW. Even the good looking blond guy was a drag. The women in the film have nothing to do but look miserable and/or have sex because they are SO turned on by men who are willing to die in cars. Really? The hospital scenes are purely gross. I did not even watch most of it. The car racing scenes are techno--meaning that they are quick cut aways and close ups of people's faces ==a lot of nothing. If you want a race movie go see Grand Prix. This is getting good reviews because Ron Howard directed it. Sad. The guy has lost whatever went into making Apollo 13 or Beautiful Mind or Splash etc.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No matter how obsessed we continue to be with the 1970s, there's always one more myth left to excavate, and this very entertaining and well-made motor racing movie from director Ron Howard and screenwriter Peter Morgan brings us a meaty tale from 1976: a story of antler-clashing, engine- revving alpha-males. This was a year in which not everyone in fact was obsessed with the release of the Sex Pistols' Anarchy in the UK. In the profoundly conservative world of Formula One, millions of TV viewers were increasingly preoccupied with an extraordinary duel developing between two drivers: the glamorous swashbuckler from Britain, James Hunt, and the icily correct Austrian Niki Lauda.</fullReview>
