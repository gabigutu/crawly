		<shortDescription>Clint Eastwood's First Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>By the early 70s, actor Clint Eastwood's career had gone from being a mere extra to a well-known Hollywood star. Thanks to the success of Sergio Leone's immortal Westerns, Eastwood was noticed and soon he began to work in very good projects, with great results. Despite being a respected actor, nobody could have imagined that his talent as director was even superior to his acting skills, and after a fairly good debut in 1971 (the thriller "Play Misty for Me"), he crafted his first masterpiece in 1973 as a tribute to his own artistic mentors: the haunting western "High Plains Drifter"."High Plains Drifter" is the story of a small mining town named "Lago" which is constantly troubled by outlaws and gunfighters. One day a stranger (Clint Eastwood) comes to town, and manages to kill three of those outlaws, gaining instant recognition and the offer of having whatever he wants from the town if he gets rid of the rest of the gang. He accepts but the town doesn't know that the mysterious stranger has a secret that will change their lives for ever.The figure of the stranger comes to town to alter the fragile equilibrium of their existence, and soon the town's own demons return to haunt them. Eastwood's character is not exactly the hero we know, but a morally ambiguous cruel man that doesn't hesitate to use and abuse the townspeople and that clearly has an agenda of his own. Written by Ernest Tidyman, this is a dark tale that explores the ambiguous morality of people and the concepts of justice and revenge.Eastwood's second directorial effort is a powerful movie that brilliantly combines the elements of Western with those of suspense and thriller. Due to his solid career in Westerns, Eastwood knows the genre's characteristics and pushes them forward to create something more, a movie beyond its genre. With brilliant camera-work, he goes from dream sequences out of a nightmare to day sequences in Leone's Spaghetti Western style. This is definitely a tribute to his mentors (In fact, he included a small reference to his directors in a cemetery scene).The acting is remarkably good, with Eastwood himself leading the cast with great skill and his powerful presence. His character is a lot more complex than his "Man With No Name" and it could be said that he mixes in one character the characteristics of the three outlaws of "The Good, The Bad and the Ugly". The underrated Billy Curtis is great as Mordecai, probably the only one in town who knows (and understands) the stranger's secret. The rest of the cast is very good and even those in small roles (such as William O'Connell as the barber) give performances of high quality. Apparently Eastwood's talent with people was there from the beginning.Tidyman's story is very well-constructed, and can be seen from diverse points of view. Every character in town is well-defined no matter how long their screen-time is, and Eastwood makes the most of it. It's hard to find a flaw in this movie and I really can't praise it enough. It is a story that once that grabs you never lets you go."High Plains Drifter" is a must-see, not only for Western fans, it is a powerful story that is more than what it seems. Great camera-work, haunting images, terrific script, superb acting, all pieces fit to create Clint Eastwood's first masterpiece. This dark western sets the path of Eastwood's career as a director and one can see why is he one of the best directors alive. 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Man With No Name has returns as an avenging angel of death!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The exotic location in the desert, near Lake Mono in the California Sierras, certainly gives the film a fresh and refined look among Westerns...The sparkling colors of the backgrounds and the changing cloud formations gave effective shots...The film has certainly the most dramatic opening sequence of any Western... Through the burning desert, Bruce Surtees' lens discovers a lone horseman.... The camera pans with the horseman to reveal a small town by a lake-lagoon... The horseman rides in, the camera tracking behind him, interrupted with faces of suspicious locals - even a coffin maker with his merchandises - and instantly one is reminded of Sergio Leone and his faithful reproduction of Kurosawa... A coach driver cracks the whip... The horseman turns, and moves back... He enters a bar and asks for 'a beer and a bottle.' A town heavy intervenes: 'Flea-bitten range-bums don't usually stop in Lago. Life here is a little too quick for them. Maybe you think you're fast enough to keep up with us!' The drifter replies: 'I'm faster than you'll ever live to be!'True to his promise, the Stranger kills the 'trouble shooter' and his two friends, and also rapes the town belle who responds as any Eastwood feminine victim is obliged to, with resistance turning strangely to joy... The town midget, Mordecai (Billy Curtis) offers him a cigar inquiring: 'What did you say your name was again?' The hardened Stranger replies: 'I didn't!'The Man With No Name has returned, this time, quite literally, with a vengeance... His dictatorship is flavored with cool humor... The name Billy Borders is mentioned to him...'Don't know the man,' he confesses.'You didn't have much time to,' comes the reply, 'because you shot him yesterday.'When his rape victim, Callie Travers (Mariana Hill) inaccurately empties a pistol at him during his bath, he casually resurfaces, cigar still in his mouth, and in an aside to his sidekick, Mordecai, reflects: 'I wonder what took her so long to get mad?' His fellow chauvinist suggests, 'Maybe because you didn't come back for more.'The townsfolk accedes to the Stranger's requests, who pushes them to the limit, even forcing them to paint the entire town blood red... 'When we get down,' says one of them, 'this place is going to look like hell.'This is the Stranger's intention; he takes a brush and strokes out the name 'Logo' on the town sign and writes 'Hell' instead.In a series of flashbacks, primarily from the Stranger's point of view and later from Mordecai's, it is revealed that the townsfolk stood by and let three men whip their Marshal to death... The Marshal had discovered that the basis of the town's prosperity, a mine, was actually on government land and not on the townspeople's own. He was going to report this, so no-one felt obliged to intervene when he met his vicious end... His body now was lying outside the town in an unmarked grave: 'They say the dead don't rest without a marker of some kind... he's the reason this town's afraid of strangers.'Now they have reason to be afraid of the three men who paid the price for the crime in which they all agreed... The Stranger analyzes this fear: 'It's what people know about themselves inside that makes them afraid.' The town reaction to his is reserved... A group of vigilantes try to kill him... The Stranger repays them with a stick of dynamite... Despite their training, the remaining locals are horrified when they realize that he does not intend to remain for the final showdown..."High Plains Drifter" is one of the most important Westerns ever made, and when Eastwood takes his rightful place in film history alongside Cooper and Stewart and Wayne, this is the film that will be seen as the quintessential example of his art...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An entertaining and well thought out western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really had no idea what to expect when I grabbed High Plains Drifter from the video store shelf. I recently saw The Outlaw Josey Wales, and really enjoying that film, I figured I couldn't go wrong; I was right. High Plains Drifter is more than just another western with the standard assortment of gun fights, bar scenes, and shots of horseback riding on wide-open prairie. To be sure, it does have its share of the said events, it is a western after all, but what I particularly liked was the film's character development and well thought out story.I don't want to ruin any of the film's enjoyment for any potential viewers, so I won't go into describing any of the characters. Suffice it to say though that they all have a very realistic quality to them, especially Clint Eastwood's character. No stereotyped good guys/bad guys here, thank you very much.As I mentioned, the story is also very nicely developed. It has multiple layers which are peeled away as the movie progresses, remaining entertained throughout.High Plains Drifter is an excellent western. If you're a fan of the genre, you'll no doubt find it to be an entertaining watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Supernatural Western?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A lone gunman with no name and seemingly with no past, rides into the dusky town of Lago. The residents of Lago at first view the stranger with suspicion, but when news that some outlaws that are out for blood are on their way to town, they ask the stranger for his help. This is Clint Eastwood's first Western film that he directed, and it's clear and evident that the guy not only loves the genre that made his name, he also knows what makes it work. Obviously having worked for Sergio Leone, Eastwood was making notes because High Plains Drifter oozes the mythical aura of many of Leone's finest genre offerings. To which, with thanks, the result is one of the best offerings in the 70s for the Oater enthusiast. The film opens with our mysterious drifter slowly coming out of the beautiful sprawling haze and into Lago, it's ethereal, then there's just the sound of the horse breathing and the clop of its hooves that can be heard (the sound mix here is incredible), it's a gloriously mysterious opening that sets the tone perfectly. Yet Eastwood is just toying with us though, for a quick jolt of sex and violence snaps us out of the beatific warmth and into a quite hauntingly cold and morally challenged place. From here on in the stranger will demand all manner of odd things from the residents of Lago, he seems to be toying with them and revelling in their discomfort, with Lago quickly resembling an arid hellhole. You see, Lago has a dark secret, and our mysterious stranger has a purpose, and it's this purpose that makes High Plains Drifter an intriguing and gripping experience. A well known fact now is that the great man of the genre, John Wayne, wrote Eastwood to strongly complain about his harsh vision of the West, one can only think the Duke failed to grasp the post Vietnam feel of a 70s made Western. It's a great directorial effort from Eastwood, more so when you marry up his acting performance to his directorial duties. Very much the perfect role, it lets Eastwood accentuate his rugged Western leanings. Eastwood would direct the similarly themed Pale Rider in the 80s and then the genre crown topper Unforgiven in the 90s. A Western great in each decade? Well that will always be debatable, but what we do know is that the Western genre was considerably lucky to have had such a man to keep the genre going for the newer interested wanderers into the Wild West. Beautifully photographed (Bruce Surtees) on the shores of Mono Lake, California, it's a film pungent with sex, sadism, retribution and risks. High Plains Drifter is mystical and magnificent and essential Western fare. 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A dark, cruel supernatural western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A small frontier town is worried and scared for it's future. Three men who murdered the sheriff in front of the whole town have been released from jail and are heading back to take revenge on the town. When a stranger comes into town, he is offered anything he wants if he will help defend them against the men. The stranger accepts but both he and the townsfolk have hidden agendas.High Plains Drifter stands out from Eastwood's many good westerns simply because it is a lack darker than many others I've seen and also possesses a weird supernatural quality to it. The plot is immediately dark, although it starts with Eastwood being who we expect him to be, an early rape sets him out with a more morally complex character than I had expected. This darker, cruel strand continues as it is clear that, although hired to protect them, the stranger also seems to be taking pleasure from harming the town itself.Those who have seen it will know the ending, although it is evident from the first flashback what the film's twist is. Knowing it doesn't make the film less enjoyable but it is probably better to figure it out yourself. The film also has a good streak of humour going through it and is enjoyable ? the twist of the stranger punishing the townsfolk easily filling the time.Eastwood is as good as always but the support cast is also full of well known faces. The direction is good and adds to the weird feel to it, the music makes it feel other worldly and the flashbacks to the whipping stop it all getting too light. By the time the town literally becomes hell, the film has always won me over.Overall this is maybe not the best western Eastwood has ever done but it is certainly one of the most different! The supernatural twist and the streak of cruelty running through the film make it very interesting to watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Darkest Eastwood western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"High Plains Drifter" is probably Clint Eastwood's darkest western and that says quite a bit. It has similarities with "Pale Rider", his other western gem. The hero is a mysterious, ghost-like figure and he fights against the evil and corruption that infests a small town in the middle of nowhere. What sets these two films apart is that here Eastwood is fighting a lone battle , and his only sidekick is the midget Mordecai, while almost all other inhabitants of Lago are corrupted or/and cowardly.Eastwood delivers one of his strongest performances here and manages to be charming and humorous besides exacting cool-blooded vengeance. His interactions with the two women (Marianna Hill and Verna Bloom, both solid in their roles) who are very different draws comparisons to his earlier film "Hang 'Em High". But what sets this apart from the typical Eastwood fare is the dark nature of this movie. Anthony James, the man with the unforgettable face, is once again back as one of the main villains. The rest of the cast are quite forgettable and lesser known names, which adds credibility to this movie, making it a film to be taken seriously and not just a gathering of famous faces.This film's perhaps strongest asset is the excellent screenplay by Ernest Tidyman, the Oscar-winner for "French Connection" and it is probably the best screenplay ever written for an Eastwood-directed western. The storyline never ceases to surprise and is full of suspense and great dialogue. As always, Clint knew who to pick. As always in the Clint films, this movie is not about love. Clint and Bloom's affair almost results in love, but it never gets the chance to develop. The surprise ending adds a great touch. This film really is a delight for fans of Clint Eastwood and unusual, film-noirish westerns.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a chick flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Obviously this was produced before the age of feminist political correctness. The anti-hero with no name--Clint Eastwood, of course, a throwback to his days making spaghetti westerns in Italy with Sergio Leone--comes riding tall in the saddle down into a valley with a mining town by a lake. (The movie was shot around the Mono Lake area of California.) Particularly effective in this unforgettable opening scene is the music sounding like the high whine of the wind off of the desert. This town would be "Lago" later to be renamed "Hell" by Eastwood's character who is identified in the titles as "The Stranger." The stranger really just wants a shave and a bath and something to drink and eat and place to lay his head for the night. What he gets is a bad time from some roughnecks and a woman (Callie Travers, played by Marianna Hill) who has attraction/avoidance feelings for him. He shoots the three guys and rapes the woman before the movie is twenty minutes old. What I mean by this not being politically correct is that, despite herself, she likes it! That sort of thing is not done in cinema these days. The idea that a woman might be turned on by being raped would not play before today's audiences, nor would a Hollywood producer make such a film. I won't go any further into the plot but suffice it to say that Eastwood is just beginning to kick tail. It seems that everybody in town is cowardly and without the will to protect themselves from the bad guys, especially the three who just got out of jail and are headed their way. How Eastwood, who directed from a script by Ernest Tidyman (The French Connection [1971]; Shaft [1971] etc.), handles the familiar revenge theme is interesting. First it is no accident that Eastwood's protagonist is named "the Stranger." That is the English title of a famous novel by Albert Camus that surely influenced Eastwood. Camus's stranger is an existential anti-hero, a kind of benign sociopath who really doesn't feel anything for others except as they affect his life. But he is not particularly violent and just lives from one day to the next without any direction or goal. He just "exists." Eastwood's stranger does more than just exist. He takes action, and he is very good at it. Indeed, I can't recall a western movie in which a gunman could draw faster or shot straighter, or any movie hero who was less afraid of putting his life on the line. So, in a sense what Eastwood has added to Camus's stranger is Nietzsche's superman. And herein lies, I think, the underpinning of Eastwood's philosophy and his "message." Note that the people in the town to a man are cowardly. The only exception is Sarah Belding (Verna Bloom) who, like the aforementioned Callie Travers, can't resist the stranger's forceful charm, and falls in love with him. This somehow inspires her to leave the corrupt town. Yes, the town, like most of human society is corrupt. And yes the average man in the street is cowardly and without the will to defend himself. It is only the ubermensch, that rare breed celebrated in the works of the German philosopher, who has the skill, the strength and the will to bend events to his liking and to take on those who would use violence to achieve their ends. So what Eastwood does here in his second directorial effort (following Play Misty for Me, 1971) is to diverge from Leone's formula. While there is some very funny and intentionally ridiculous dialogue in such films as, for example, The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly (1966), or For a Few Dollars More (1965) or A Fistful of Dollars (1964), there is little that is funny, intentionally or otherwise in High Plains Drifter. Furthermore, whereas Leone just wanted to make a buck and saw that tough-minded heroes or anti-heroes involved in action-filled revenge plots was a good way to do it, Eastwood is interested in also making a philosophic (and perhaps political) statement. We are degenerate, we humans, he is saying, except for those rare individuals who take the law into their own hands, make their own rules, and through superior skill and bravery, make their own luck and create their own reality, as does his stranger. In this film there is also an element of the supernatural, or so it would appear. The stranger "sees" in his head the whipping of a past sheriff of the town. Perhaps it comes from the mind of the dwarf Mordecai (very well played by Billy Curtis, by the way) who witnessed the tortured death while hiding under the saloon. At any rate, the stranger shows that he is just as handy with the whip himself as he is with his six-gun. By all means see this for an early look at the work of Clint Eastwood as both an actor and a director. You will not be bored I can assure you. But don't invite the girl friend over. If there was ever an anti-"chickflick," this is it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A superb western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As is often the case with a Clint Eastwood western, High Plains Drifter is rather good.The usual scenario opens, with Eastwood (playing an unnamed character again) riding into a small mining town, Lagos, where a small group of thugs unsuccessfully try to kill him.This small act serves as an introduction to the local townsfolk: small-minded cowards who are all talk and no action. They also bear a horrifying secret.Eastwood is eventually approached to help them fend off an upcoming attack from three criminals who have just been released from prison.He also suffers from a recurring nightmare, which I will leave to you to find out.Needless to say, all of the pieces come together by the end, and those of you not astute enough to have noticed will be saying, "of course!"A good story combines with Eastwood's anti-heroic personality (he never really played a good guy, did he?) and a good supporting cast to produce one of the best westerns of the 1970s. As the Maltin summary states: "Half-serious, half tongue-in-cheek, with great role for midget Billy Curtis."Curtis plays Mortecai, the town dwarf, who shadows Eastwood around Lagos. Some of the scenes in this are extremely funny, but are balanced by some harshly violent moments, of which Eastwood's nightmares are a prime example.1985's Pale Rider bears similarity to High Plains Drifter in certain areas, but you'll have to watch that yourself to find out where.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best westerns of all time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Most people are turned off by this film because it won't surrender to the audience. The film won't let people like the characters but I think that's the great element of this film. This town is chock full of cowards and not one(except the midget) deserves to be rescued. See most westerns have the undeniable lovable characters that deserve to be saved from corruption. Eastwood takes this film in a twisted, unique direction. Someone on this board said this didn't appear to have supernatural elements in it. I disagree. At the end Eastwood's character is asked by the midget Billy Curtis who he was. Eastwood told him that he knew. Billy then looked down at the tombstone of the dead sheriff that was killed by the three bandits. Eastwood then disappears into the sun's haze as he rides away from the town of Lago(at the conclusion of the film) with eerie music in the background. I liked the film's dark tone and thought this was more than just a western. It had those thriller elements,too. One other part of the movie that adds to it's supernatural aura is when Eastwood remembers back to the sheriff's whipping death at the hands of the three bandits(Eastwood wasn't even there, how would he know about that). This has it's detractors for it can be very off putting and very violent. But it's still fresh and very creepy. 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Avenger Angel Looking for Revenge</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the coastal city of Lago, a stranger (Clint Eastwood) arrives and is challenged by three `bad guys'. He kills them and sooner is invited by the locals to protect the city against three outlaws that would leave a nearby prison in a couple of days. One year ago, these bandits killed Marshal Jim Duncan using whips. The marshal asked for help and the coward persons did not help him. The killers were sent to jail and promised to burn the city when they leave the jail. The citizens offer anything the stranger want `free of charge' if he protects them against the rage of the criminals. What they do not know is that the stranger is the avenger angel of the killed marshal looking for revenge. This movie about revenge is great: we never know whether the `stranger without a name' is a brother or friend of Jim Duncan, or whether he is Jim Duncan himself looking for revenge. Fans of western movies will not be disappointed with this story, no matter whether he is a cowboy or a supernatural character. My vote is seven.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Clint Eastwood's Signature Film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Of all of his westerns, his performance in 'Drifter was time and again the movie that, unarguably to me, defined his career. From the opening minutes when he rides into town, and coolly walks up to the bar, to the time he vaporizes into thin air when the credits roll, his performance in this film was gritty, flawless and truly Eastwood. Another quality to the movie is it's blend of atmosphere and story, no wonder why its played over and over again on TV. I remember watching it for the first time when I was around 12 (1985) I was very impressionable then and I remember how cool it was to watch Clint go thru his motions during the movie. Nobody knew his name or where he came from, and he didn't oblige them by making them guess throughout the movie. He shot his gun with lethal accuracy when anyone gave him trouble, and was noncommittal to the cowardly townsfolk who wanted his help to take care of the outlaws released from jail. He did things his own way. Those are just some of the reasons why I gave this film 9 stars out of a perfect 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Clint Eastwood revives his signature role as "The Man with no Name" as he seems to come out of nowhere from the distant prairie and descends upon the sleepy little town of Largo and after that things there will never be the same again for the people who live there.A film that has a lot more to it then what you see at first with Eastwood not being that mysterious and having a past which is seen in flashback every so often in the movie. Styled a lot like "High Noon" but with a twist that builds up slowly at first then takes off like a loose bronco to it's dramatic and fiery conclusion."High Plains Drifter" doesn't follow the well worn standard western scenario which is why it make it unique and thought-provoking at the same time. Eastwood was never better here as the cool yet pragmatic stranger who's very anonymity makes him both mysterious and threatening to everyone he ruins into, friend or foe. Over the years since "High Plains Drifter" was released, back in 1973, it has reached cult statues and Eastwood has never made another western as good and as "High Plains Drifter" and that includes "The Unforgiven". Eastwood is more then a match against those out to get him but what they, his enemies as well as the audience, don't know until the very end of the movie is that Clint has something, besides his quick guns and steel nerves, that is far beyond that of mortal man.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>12th Review: Deconstructing the Western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>High Plains Drifter looks and feels like a deconstruction of the language of the Western.A brilliant mix of psychological and macabre, and in places even quite bizarre, it is an investigation of what is created when weakness and desire meet the man driven half to madness (Eastwood) yet seems sane: he is pathological, but is he the only standard of true sanity as a protagonist here? Has he truly lost all sense of ethic? He starts here as the archetype of antiutilitariansim: nothing he does is for anyone's benefit if it costs him a moment of care. He is cold, brutal, effective. Yet behind this there is a sense that he has a twisted right on his side. Having being so wronged his revenge is more complex than simply killing: it demands retribution, and retribution demands the whole town pays.More existential than even Once upon A time in the West, or, the Good, the Bad, and the Ugly it is about the nihilism and the circle of violence that must be closed.The filming is supremely confident for a second film: real silences and pauses, laugh out loud lines and situations and cold, cold chills: the language of film is expressed explicitly and implicitly. This is the death knell of the Good vs. Bad traditional Western: it is more like Kurosawa's Yojimbo though here the bad guys are few and the townsfolk are by implication as guilty as the rest because they let evil thrive and let it break a good man.Never answering it's own questions: like Lago itself it is a world created in isolation and as such is a unique and powerful testament to Eastwood's continuing expression of the darker psyche of the cost of opening up the cowboy image and getting to a colder, starker, realism that defined 70s films.Compulsive viewing and an important film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Welcome to Lago, no actually its Hell!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A mysteriously callous stranger (Clint Eastwood) rides out of the desert into a small town called Lago and terrifies the locals by raping a lady and treading over the townsfolk, but when he kills three cowboys who wanted to make something out of nothing. The inhabitants are grateful that he freed them, but then they try to hire him to protect from three more cowboys who will return back to town when they finish their jail sentence in the next day or two. The stranger refuses the offer at first but when they tell him he can take anything for free and have power over the town he accepts the offer. Through this power he changes things around in town for his pleasure and this causes disruption amongst the locals who seem to regret hiring him.Oh, I just love this bewildering film and I can't get enough of it! What we get here is a brutally mystical revenge western by Director/Star Clint Eastwood. I was totally mesmerised by it and Eastwood's direction is on the boil by capturing a strong essence of charm and also discomfort. It has a lot of elements going for it that it makes you (well, me) want to watch it over and over again. That's probably a good idea too, as thorough symbolisms and blinding supernatural occurrences fill the cryptic story. Some you might pick up on, while others don't seem to standout but are hidden under the material. Those enigmatic factors really keep your full interest, as the plot is played out very well with an eerie beginning that just pulls you in and then it ends with such a cunning conclusion. Before we get to the conclusion the haunting climax definitely builds sheer dread and packs bite with its visuals? a lot of bite! There's not much action in the film, but the story's subplots is what guides it and slowly builds the questions. You just wonder - There's got to be more to this new stranger in town and the townsfolk seemed to be keeping some hidden secret (or sin) behind close doors? The more the story builds on those the queries the less you seem to worry about the lack of gunfights and brawls. You actually start to read more into these mysteries when some of the questions are answered towards the end. Though, also watching the stranger toy around with the (guilty) townsfolk is pretty riveting stuff.Another feature that blows you away would be how atmospheric it does get, with a pounding and alienating score that ticks away with its high pitch and howling sounds. These just added more unease to Eastwood's character when he was on screen with this humming score in the background. It just holds such an inspiring awe with its striking rigorous and desolated backdrop that went hand-to-hand with the brood horror and hell that follows the town's inhabitants. Engrossing scenery fills the back-shot with its vast mountains ranges and open spaces of dirt and rocks. One thing that stood out for me was the quieter moments, when it focused on body language and facial expressions to portray emotions. This really added to the alarming mood and a fairly sparse script was incredibly effective in making it highly-strung. Even the uneasy sound effects are used to great effect, especially in a particular nightmare scene. Violence is pretty much in your face and at times rather brutal, but Eastwood paces it superbly and fits it into the story. The humour that fills the story is a bit of a variety as sometimes there would be some subtle and dry humour, but then again when the dwarf was on screen it seems to play more as a loud joke. Steady camera-work is evident with plenty angle shots from behind and above and the occasional zoom. The texture of the film's material and powerful visuals is real moody, daring and it has a fairly cold-hearted tone to it all. It just leaves you with such an empty feeling.Performance wise the cast was nothing but top-grade. Dauntingly malevolent is a good way to describe Eastwood persona as the mysterious stranger, in which he gives a typically first-rate and hypnotic performance (as usual). Is he some sort of Revenging Angel or a ghost of the past? This is what you ask. But anti-hero definitely comes to mind. The supporting cast is exceptional with the likes of the Verna Bloom, Billy Curtis, Marianna Hill, Mitch Ryan, Stefan Gierasch and Jack Ging.This is one spellbinding semi-supernatural Western!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Well it's what people know about themselves inside that makes 'em afraid."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm perfectly willing to allow Clint Eastwood his pronouncement of ambiguity regarding the character of 'The Stranger', and have read with interest the many opinions offered in the reviews and threads on this site. I've seen the movie at least a half dozen times over the years, but today it was with the express intent of crystallizing my opinion. As I've felt all along, the character of The Stranger is indeed a mortal man, the brother of the slain town marshal Jim Duncan, and I'll get into that in a minute.Let's keep in mind that Eastwood himself has had quite some time to reflect on his direction and portrayal in the film, and the subject of a ghostly apparition had time to take hold of viewer consciousness. The film itself has added to the controversy, at least twice via statements made by hotel owner Lewis Belding (Ted Hartley). The first time occurs right after he supervises the evacuation of his hotel, remarking disparagingly to the Preacher (Robert Donner) - "...they're emptyin' my whole hotel, throwing out paying guests right into the street just to make room for our new guardian angel". Later, when addressing Lago's citizens at a town meeting right after the dinner scene with The Stranger and Callie - "...couldn't be worse if the devil himself had ridden right into Lago". So right there you have the seeds planted for both an avenging angel and a demon bent on revenge.There IS a real mystery to the film, but it's not the identity of 'The Stranger'. To fully understand, it's important to view the movie in it's unedited form via tape or DVD. Watching "High Plains Drifter" on TV, even a cable channel leaves too much out, particularly in the way of dialog, and especially regarding the character of Callie (Marianna Hill) and her relationship to the people in the town.The movie offers two flashback scenes, the first by 'The Stranger' only about twenty minutes into the story, the second by Mordecai (Billy Curtis), again shortly after the evacuation of the hotel guests. In both flashbacks, one is able to recognize every citizen of Lago that we already know by name, EXCEPT ONE. About midway in each scene, a character is shown entering from, and then retreating back into the shadows, with half of a bearded face visible. It's the face of The Stranger. The reason Eastwood's character can recall with clarity what occurred on the night Marshal Duncan was killed is because he was there. The mystery then becomes why he was powerless at the time to intervene on his brother's behalf. Presumably he wasn't a citizen of Lago, or he would be recognized, so there must have been another reason for him to be there. Visiting his brother, certainly, but for reasons unknown and unexplored, 'The Stranger' did not become involved at the time of his brother's death.The one person who had an inkling to The Strangers' identity I feel, was Sarah Belding, making reference to the dead marshal in an unmarked grave. But The Stranger wasn't biting, he intended to remain anonymous, a position he affirmed when he first checked into Belding's hotel and didn't register. Sure he could have used a phony name, but then some of the mystique he was attempting to establish would have been compromised.I'm quite intrigued reading some of the threads maintaining certainty regarding The Stranger being a 'spirit' citing reactions the character has, as if one could actually know how a spirit would go about his business. But since we're playing that game, I'd offer two reasons why he couldn't be a spirit or a demon. On the ride into town, The Stranger's reflection is shown on one of the store front windows as he goes past. Then in the first bar scene, The Stranger's arm casts a shadow on the wall as he takes his beer. Granted, most of my spirit and demon lore has come from other movies and popular literature, but I believe that both of those occurrences aren't possible with beings from the other side. What REALLY intrigues me now is if Eastwood was clever enough to consciously plant those things in the film to keep everyone and his brother (no pun there) guessing. Oh, and one last thing - if The Stranger really WAS a ghost, then who's ghost was the horse he rode in on?When I first entered a rating for this film on IMDb, I gave it a strong '8' as one of the upper echelon film Westerns, right up there with "High Noon", "Shane", and Eastwood's own "Unforgiven". However now, after having so much fun watching and re-watching the movie, and reading some of the great discussion on this site, that has to warrant at least two bonus points, I'm re-establishing my rating as a '10'.One last thing - if you're interested in hearing Clint Eastwood himself describe who/what the character of The Stranger represents, head over to his website at http://www.clinteastwood.net/welcome2.htmlFollow the links to the movie, and then click on the audio icon for "High Plains Drifter".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Completely disturbing, dark, violent western with an interesting Supernatural element</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>High Plains Drifter is one of the many Westerns I have seen as of recently. So far it is the most unique, and the most dark, twisted story yet. Clint Eastwood directs but this is far from usual tale. High Plains Drifter is perhaps one of the most unique westerns in existence because of it's Supernatural suggestions and it's disturbing theme. Nonetheless you'll be captivated by it's mood and style and when it's all said and done you'll likely have many questions and want to see it again although it will leave you feeling truly afraid for the first time of The Man With No Name.Clint Eastwood directs and stars as the mysterious stranger who rides into a small town one day and faces a group of gun slingers hired to keep trash out of the small town. But in true Eastwood style he makes short work of them and suddenly becomes the only gun slinger in town to protect them. But is he protecting them?? This time Eastwood's stranger is disturbed, vicious, violent, completely off the deep end. Whereas the strangers in his previous films have been far more cool and collective there is something evil about this man. As the film is hyped in the first 20 minutes he commits three murders and a rape and takes control of the town. Seeing Eastwood in this role is a little jarring always having pictured him as the Western Hero but still he plays the role to it's fullest and makes this what it is. Billy Curtis plays Mordecai, the man who becomes the stranger's wing man so to speak. Curtis is more of the hero than anyone in town and is mostly under rated by everyone there. He does a great job of adding the overall feeling of gloom to the small town. The rest of the cast that make up the small town including Verna Bloom, Mitch Ryan, Robert Donner, Jack Ging, and Stefan Gierasch do a great job. They all have this distinct air of being dirty, evil, no good, and as the history of this town unfolds we discover their individual sins and deeds that they have committed. Terrific character actor Geoffrey Lewis plays Stacey Bridges, the typical Western villain riding himself into a completely not typical western town where sin is being rectified. When Eastwood is the most evil thing in the Western you'd have to be a good actor to still come across as a bad guy and Lewis does that perfectly. He's a worth adversary to Eastwood's stranger.High Plains Drifter is one Western I could debate and discuss on for hours and hours. I think Eastwood is a ghost or some sort of angel of Vengeance sent to this town to make them pay for allowing a good man to be whipped to death in front of them in order to hide their shady business dealings with a mine that belonged to the Government. There is so much depth and hidden story to this film that it is just amazing!! The entire back story of this town unfolds while we are watching Eastwood exact his revenge and turn this town into Hell, literally. We don't know exactly what the town has done until it's nearly all over but he gets his vengeance and makes them pay. Without a doubt a disturbing and twisted film and an absolute must see for anyone who loves cinema and wants something different from a classic, tried and true genre like The Western and leave it to Eastwood to pull it off. I think High Plains Drifter is probably one of the most underrated films of all time. The tone of the film and message and story is so disturbing I'm not sure I'd ever watch it again and yet that being said it was so brilliant. I know many have said that Eastwood has explained numerous times the stranger in this film and that he was completely human but I like to look at it from a Supernatural angle because there is a sincere shiver up my spine when Mordecai says to Eastwood's stranger "I don't even know who you are" and Eastwood says..."Yes you do" and rides off into the sunset until he literally vanishes into thin air. It's completely different and a must see!! 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Eastwood's only great film as director?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Excellent, spare western is Eastwood's unacknowledged masterpiece. Features Mordecai the midget (Curtis), whom Eastwood's gunman turns into the town marshall and mayor. Basic Yojimbo-inspired plot embellished by powerful social commentary and violent, hallucinatory nightmare sequences. the only thing that makes Eastwood's destructive, cynical hero palatable is how pathetic the townspeople he's humiliating are. He paints the town red, watches everyone die, and returns to the grave. A must-see for fans of continental Westerns for its quality, depth, and for the clarity of its hellish vision. Great photography, nice location to fit the desolate mood of the story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Eastwood rides into a western town...get those pine boxes ready...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I rank HIGH PLAINS DRIFTER as a better than average Clint Eastwood film with Eastwood himself at the helm as director. It's really a character driven story set against a western backdrop with Clint as the avenger who rides into town presumably to avenge the murder of a man whipped to death while the townspeople shrank back in the shadows merely watching.We learn later that the whipped man threatened to expose a secret about the town's mine that they were hiding and his name was Marshall Duncan, the man responsible for turning in the outlaws who served prison time and came back for their own brand of revenge.It's a grim story with some clever plotting and a relentlessly suspenseful tone that keeps you glued to your seat until the final acts of revenge have been executed.I know none of the players other than Eastwood, but VERNA BLOOM (who reminds me a little of Vera Miles facially), is excellent as the only halfway decent person who recognizes the mission Eastwood is on. He plays the role with his usual grim sense of humor and sarcasm, riding off into the hills after most of the bad guys are disposed of.The final scene is set up so that he never actually gives his name, but he tells the sheriff inquiring "What's your name?" that he should know to whom he's speaking and the camera pans to the grave marker of Marshal Duncan, indicating perhaps that Clint is the brother of the murdered man. At least that's the implication I get from the ending.Summing up: Fascinating, mysterious, enigmatic and compelling western is food for thought...but full of graphic violence, not suitable for young kids.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lessons from the masters, well learned in Eastwood's first western as director</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've been a fairly big Clint Eastwood fan for 20 years - interestingly enough though, I'd only seen this, his second directorial effort and first western as director once, a long time ago. Seeing as how I was going to be re-visiting The Outlaw Josey Wales for a film club though, now was as good a time as any for a re-watch.The plot couldn't be simpler, in many ways harking back to "A Fistful of Dollars" in its elegant, stripped storyline: A stranger (Clint) rides into the town of Lago, quickly getting into a shootout that he didn't start and besting the three gunfighters that the town had hired to protect them. The townspeople are afraid of another trio who had once been on the payroll also, doing time in prison for a crime committed a year before that the town is complicit in, and due back to wreak vengeance. Seeing as how their protectors are dead, they agree to hire the stranger at any cost, and he proceeds to wreak havoc on the town in more ways than one before proceeding on his way after filling his bargain in apocalyptic fashion.If the plot's simple, the characters, style and symbolism of the piece are a little less so. The Stranger it seems is haunted by dreams - memories or visions, who can say for sure? of a man who seems to be him, the town's former marshall, whipped to death by those same three men riding back for their own vengeance. "Lago" means "lake" and the town sits on an unnamed body of water; the town seems brand-new, most of the buildings are still under construction and unpainted, though from what we learn it's been around for over a year; the townspeople are greedy and cowardly, and The Stranger is cold, merciless, in the end even demonic. Is he a figure of vengeance, a revenant or demon sent from the real Hell that he names the town after, and that the marshall is seen in one flashback as damning it to, as he orders it painted completely red before the killers arrive in town? Though nearly everybody in the town is unpleasant, a couple of more positive images do stand out - Verna Bloom in one of the two significant female roles is the hotel-keeper's wife, who seems at first to despise The Stranger but seemingly just because he's another brutal bastard - when she realizes that he's the only man in the town with guts she softens, and he beds her just before the showdown. A dwarf, Mordecai (Billy Curtis), is also treated more softly, with The Stranger proclaiming him sheriff and mayor, pumping him up to the point where he alone of all the townsmen shows any guts at the eventual gun battle. I suppose it could be said that Clint's vengeful figure is capable of some charity and feeling towards the only two positive and "good" characters in the film. Significantly enough the other female character, a single woman (perhaps a whore? it's never very clear) named Callie (Marianna Hill) who he rapes shortly after entering town, develops an ambiguous love-hate attitude towards him and it's left quite ambiguous as to how much has to do with the rape (which both The Stranger and other townspeople deny) or because he then ignores her for the most part, even after she betrays him at one point.A town that seemed promising and new, fresh and full of vitality at the beginning of the film, perched on a cool lake and apparently prosperous, at the end has been half-burnt and decimated through a supernatural wrath, a vengeance for the greed and cowardice that killed a marshall and cowers before his redeemer - this is old-Testament film-making of a pure kind that Eastwood never really returned to in such an obvious way. There are certainly obvious odes to his spaghetti years, in the dirt and violence and unpleasantness of the townspeople and their souls, in Dee Barton's wonderfully eclectic, eerie score and of course in Eastwood's character; I also think it shares some kinship with the Don Siegel-directed Civil War film The Beguiled from 1971, another film with more than a touch of the supernatural, and few redeeming characters. But Clint makes it his own through the economy and his refusal to make things any more flashy or outré than the screenplay calls for (which is plenty). The cast is terrific, mostly made up of names that were second-tier at best at the time and are largely forgotten now. Bloom and Curtis are especially good Perhaps not one of the very best 70s westerns, and I'd certainly still put it behind "Josey Wales" and "Unforgiven" in Eastwood's western-ography, but it's definitely one of the weirder and more fascinating examples of the genre from America during the period.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My Favorite Clint Eastwood Western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While other Clint Eastwood westerns have received more fanfare (The Outlaw Josey Wales and Unforgiven come to mind), this is my favorite of them all. This most certainly isn't your Daddy's traditional John Wayne fare, and those expecting to see as such will be surely disappointed or at the very least surprised. Eastwood made a name for himself in the 60's as the "Man With no Name" in several Sergio Leone spaghetti westerns, and he continues this anti-hero character in 1973's High Plains Drifter, a dark revenge fantasy many viewers (mistakenly) think has supernatural elements to it.Eastwood rides into the town of Lago and immediately guns down three "troubleshooters" who goad him into a fight. We quickly find out the dead men had been hired to protect the town from three other criminals who are due to get out of a territorial prison and seek revenge on those in Lago who had been responsible for their imprisonment. Realizing he is their best chance to save the town and themselves from impending destruction, several town leaders unsuccessfully seek his help. After initially refusing their request, Eastwood relents when he is promised "anything he wants" in exchange for his services. Throughout the film he takes full advantage of the town's offer through humiliating requests, outrageous demands and inconveniencing its many residents- while ostensibly setting up an ambush for the arriving criminals.We find out through a recurring dream that former sheriff Jim Duncan was whipped to death in the center of town while cowardly townspeople watched and refused to help. Eastwood's arrival is no accident: it is implied much later in the film (and by Eastwood himself off camera) that he is the brother of the dead sheriff out to seek justice, thus explaining his no-nonsense demeanor and harsh treatment of the townspeople.We root for the Eastwood character not because he is a genuinely good person but because everyone in town is either crooked (the mining officials), gutless (bartender, barber, sheriff) or simply unable to stand up for themselves (the women, the midget). We revel in Eastwood's actions simply because everyone else receives their just comeuppance. This film is well acted, well paced and entertaining. Present are many fine character actors- Mitchell Ryan, Stefan Gierasch, Walter Barnes, Geoffrey Lewis, and many others- who all lend to the enjoyment of the film. A must view for all Eastwood fans and another fine addition to his outstanding canon of work.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>" Ghosts, Lawmen and Spirits that go bang in the night "</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Of all the films which strike directly into the hearts of men, this film is special. The movie " High Plains Drifter " is part fact, part revenge and part moral tale. A marshal is hired in the town of Lago and discovers that leading townsmen are illegally mining on government land. When the Lawman decides to arrest them, these same citizens send a trio of gunmen to kill him. After, he is bull whipped to death in front of everyone, they close the case and pretend it didn't happen. All is forgotten, until a desert stranger (Clint Eastwood) appears and reminds the town-folks of it's unfinished obligation. Fearing retribution from the three unruly gunmen whom they falsely imprisoned, they hire the stranger to protect them. Granting him a 'free' hand in anything he might want, the citizens soon come to regret their hasty decision as the stranger makes them all pay for their spineless behavior. What transpires is a bit of Twlight Zone, pay-the-piper and holy retribution for their cowardly sins. Much to the credit of director and star Clint Eastwood and to the cast which includes Billy Curtis as Mordecai, Mitch Ryan as Dave Drake, Jack Ging as Morgan Allen, Stefan Gierasch as Mayor Jason Hobart and Geoffrey Lewis as Stacey Bridges. Dark drama, murder, rape and loathsome human interaction marks this story and collects enough entertainment to brand it as a cult Classic. ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Clintis Eastwoodis Maximus....what more need be said? This is a beautiful film all around baby. Mr. Eastwood really brings to life this creepy tale of the dead out for blood in an old west setting. The dialog is poetic, and as this beauty unfolds so do the one-liners. Watching this movie as a child, I was, and still am affected by all of these concepts. Maybe this is why I wasn't too floored about "The Crow". It had been done before, but Clint made it a western! Starting from the opening credits until the end, the cinematography is very very sweet. I love the fade-in, fade-out of our hero... "The Man With No Name". This guy has been all over the west man. I think he started off as a bounty hunter, and ended up a retired minister. I would love to see him go back out for one more ride.... ah where were we. Yes the long suspenseful shots along with the Philip Glass style soundtrack make up for one eerie western.Great film. Worth watching anytime.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant. Courage and strength, not just moral platitudes, are necessary for freedom and decency to prevail.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the best and most unique Westerns of all time, "High Plains Drifter" is probably the most interesting -- and controversial. Of course it's in the modern, non-mythological style, which neither glamorizes the old West, nor the moral codes of its protagonists. Yet this film is its own unique moral fable. Clint is absolutely at the top of his acting game. Although there certainly is violence and dramatic shots of Western landscape here (particularly the stunning opening scenes), this is overwhelmingly a character drama. Nearly all the many characters of this plot become full real people. It's a tight, spare drama with little waste. You need to pay attention, or watch it several times. Or both, to get the most out of it.What at first seems to be a shockingly amoral film, turns out to be one of the most thought provoking tales of social and personal morality and the need for personal courage I have seen. Like much of Eastwood's work, it's point of view is strongly Nietchzschian -- the extraordinary man surrounded by weaklings of various sorts. Yet this is no call for strong man rule -- it illustrates just what can happen when people are so weak as to need that. There are no pat answers here. Rather issues of right and wrong, survival and revenge, strength and weakness are dramatically played out in starkly different circumstances than most current day Americans have ever experienced. What if an entire isolated town, a social system unto itself, is complicit in murder wholly to protect it's own illegally based prosperity? What if an entire town fears for its continued existence and physical safety in the face of hard and evil men -- who are returning to exact revenge for actual wrongs done to them by that town? What if this town, this social group, is filled with moral and physical cowards, who must look outside their own, to some strong individuals, for help? How far will they debase themselves in their need for external strength, and leadership?Most shocking to today's audience will be Clint's early rape of the town's belle (and woman let's say of easily shifting alliances) Callie Travers. She clearly was trying to seduce the Stranger in her own game playing put down way, after she saw him establish dominance by blowing away the town's three gunfighters. But the Stranger then clearly takes her against her will, after he grows tired of her games. She's furious afterwards too, and tries to shoot him. An utterly clear case of rape in today's climate. No one will side with her, since this town needs this strongman. So she is defenceless, and without effective recourse. Further, the degree of her own moral compromise becomes clear when we see how easily Clint can seduce her once he has cemented his alpha domination of the town. It's clearly solely for that reason. "I don't eat with dogs" she says, at first resisting his request she join him for supper, still mad about her violation. "Oh, I think you might," Clint responds, "when it's the leader of the pack" and trains his steely gaze on her. She melts into his arms, and asks for thirty minutes, to make herself ready. This is fully believable; we've seen glimpses of the power games that make her tick from her first introduction. Her moral standing is even more compromised when in a flashback we see her next to one of the towns richest citizens (her lover?), an owner of the mine, looking impassively on as the town's paid assassins whip the town's Marshall to death. The upstanding Marshall had discovered that the mine, which is the reason for the towns prosperity and existence, is actually on government land, and felt he had to report it. Not just men, but women too can be guilty in this Eastwood film, and deserving of their own type of special punishment in this anarchic and unsocialized time and place. In the end it's the townspeople themselves, and the assassins they had had unjustly imprisoned for something they didn't do, which destroy the town in an orgy of combat, cowardice, lack of leadership and self destruction. The Stranger steps back and has no part of this on either side, having already catalyzed it's fulsome unfolding. As the assassins look to be winning in destroying the town, belle Callie Tavers, rape "victim", switches sides again and professes her never faltering love and devotion to one of them, continued she says all the time he was in jail.In contrast the hotel owner's wife, who Clint seduces rather than rapes, decides after their intimacy that she wants nothing more to do with the town or her marriage. She seems to have been ambivalent about the town's prior actions, had little direct role in them, and is now disgusted. Like the Stranger she stays out of the final melee, as she too prepares to move on.You must be brave and strong, before you can be free and enforce some sort of moral decency, is one of the teachings of this most Clint of all Eastwood's movies. Moral platitudes and preaching, but the town's utterly ineffectual Preacher or others, is not enough. There is no big brother here to do it for these people -- these townspeople are on their own. And not up to the task. The degree to which the weak, including their women, will suck up to the strong and degrade themselves, particularly when they are moral as well as physical cowards, is another. Women are not always forces of moral good here (unlike in the vast majority of Westerns). Neither are they the worst forces of evil or cowardice. (And they don't get the worst revenge either.) This is a Western with an Old Testament feel to it.As the film ends, what was earlier foreshadowed becomes crystal clear. The Stranger is the ghost or alter ego of the assassinated town Marshall. Whose grave is unmarked no longer.It's a brilliant piece of work, and probably my favorite Western.</fullReview>

Clint plays "the Stranger" role to a T but it just didn't have the same appeal without the whistling, dramatic cinematography, and mismatched lip/voice editing. Plot line was pretty simple. Setting very simple. Heck, the whole movie is simple. Still, a must see for Clint fans.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is a western version of Seven Samurai. Only a bad one. The story line is more or less the same with some unpleasant side stories. The Stranger, is NOT like other strangers of Eastwood movies. He is cruel, wild and doesn't care about anyone. Exactly an anti-hero that seems to be the only hope left, despite his obvious lack of care.The point worth noting is that this is one of Eastwood's low movies, full of inconsistency. The ugly stranger, wildly rapes a woman, kills people he doesn't like, forces them to give him stuff against their will, explodes a hotel, evacuates a hotel completely just for himself, more or less bosses people around, and in the same time helps some Indian with a lot of blankets, assigns a midget as the mayor and sheriff, and train civilians to be gun-fighters.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lesson to Lago</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There once was a frontier mining town called Lago where all it's residents lived in greed, hypocrisy and fear. The town had a Marshall to keep order but instead of the town backing the law to fight off gunslingers who were skimming money from the mines they figured they would be better off hiring the gunslingers to run the town so they in effect sanctioned the Marshall's death. The town's most prominent prostitute conspired with the gunslingers to rid the town of him. The towns clergy and congregation stood by and did nothing and the mayor and townspeople stood by and watched. The town eventually turned on these three murderers and they got sent to prison and they hired three more gunslingers to take their place. The time came for the three to be released from prison and at the same time a drifter from out of nowhere or maybe just from the nearby the high plains rode into town. A man who went by no name. A gunslinger himself who would dispense a frontier justice of his own to the entire town and befriend only those who the town got a kick out of making fun of. A midget and a couple of Indians. For every other person and in fact every building that stood in the town he had another plan. The three gunslingers on their return to Lago will find that Lago has had a change of administration since their absence and a change of name. Lago is now Hell. Clint Eastwood directs. He would make only three more Westerns in his career in The Outlaw Josey Wales in '76. Pale Rider in '85 and The Unforgiven in '92. Ernest Tidyman who wrote the series of Shaft movies had just come off an Oscar win for his screenplay for The French Connection when he wrote the screenplay for High Plains Drifter. Eastwood had just come off his directorial debut in his acclaimed film Play Misty for Me. This is a surreal film that pays homage to Eastwood mentor Sergio Leone and says good bye to the man with no name character except for in 1985 when Eastwood revived the no name character in a slightly different incarnation as the preacher in Pale Rider. This is a good and different kind of movie and I would give it a 9.0 on a scale of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>TITLE: High Plains Drifter is a 1973 American Western film, directed by and starring Clint Eastwood and produced by Robert Daley for The Malpaso Company and Universal Studios. Eastwood plays a mysterious gunfighter hired by the residents of a corrupt frontier mining town to defend them against a group of criminals. The film was influenced by the work of Eastwood's two major collaborators, film directors Sergio Leone and Don Siegel. The film was shot on location on the shores of Mono Lake, California. The screenplay was written by Ernest Tidyman, who also wrote the novelization. Dee Barton provided the eerie film score. The film was critically acclaimed at the time of its initial release and still is, holding a score of 96% on Rotten Tomatoes. Directed by Clint Eastwood, Produced by Robert Daley, Written by Ernest Tidyman RELEASE DATES: August 22, 1973 RUNNING TIME: 105 minutesSTARRING: Clint Eastwood as The Stranger, Verna Bloom as Sarah Belding, Mariana Hill as Callie Travers, Billy Curtis as Mordecai, Mitchell Ryan as Dave Drake, Jack Ging as Morgan Allen, Stefan Gierasch as Mayor Jason Hobart, Ted Hartley as Lewis Belding, William O'Connell as the Barber, and Geoffrey Lewis as Stacey Bridge SUMMARY: A stranger on horseback rides into the mining town of Lago. Three gun-toting men follow him into the saloon, taunting him. When they follow him to the barbershop and threaten him, the Stranger shoots and kills all three of them. Impressed with this performance, a dwarf named Mordecai, who works in the barbershop, befriends the Stranger. An attractive woman named Callie Travers bumps into the Stranger in the street on purpose, insults, and badgers him. When she slaps his cigar from his mouth, he drags her into the livery stable and rapes her. Next, he rents a room at the hotel. That night, he dreams about a man being brutally whipped. It is revealed later that Marshal Jim Duncan was whipped to death by gunfighters Stacey Bridges, Dan Carlin, and Cole Carlin while the people of Lago looked on. Only Sarah Belding, wife of hotelier Lewis Belding, attempted to rescue him. A corrupt faction in Lago wanted Duncan dead; as the Marshal discovered that the town's mine is on government ground, (the townsfolk feared that this news, if reported, would result in the mine being closed, which would threaten the town's livelihood). Sheriff Sam Shaw tells the Stranger he will not be charged for killing the three men. Meanwhile, the townsmen discuss Bridges and the Carlin brothers, who are due to be released from prison that day. The town double-crossed the three gunfighters after they killed Duncan, and the men are expected to seek vengeance. Since the men slain by the Stranger were the mining company's new protectors, the townsmen decide to hire the Stranger as their replacement. Presenting the offer to the Stranger, Shaw explains that the three gunfighters were caught stealing gold from the mining company, although he admits the gold was poorly protected. The Stranger declines the job until Shaw tells him he can have anything he wants. Accepting these terms, the Stranger indulges in the town's goods and services, and makes Mordecai both sheriff and mayor. He also has Belding's clients moved out of the hotel, dismantles Belding's barn in order to make picnic benches, has the entire town painted red, and paints the word "HELL" on the "LAGO" sign just outside of town. While the Stranger trains the townspeople to defend themselves, Bridges and the Carlin brothers are released from prison and make their way to Lago. They begin on foot but kill three men and take their horses. A group of townsfolk tries to ambush the Stranger in the hotel, but he kills all but one of them. After Belding inadvertently divulges his complicity in the attack, (which left the hotel destroyed), the Stranger drags Sarah Belding into their room, and she sleeps with him willingly. The next morning, Sarah tells the Stranger about Duncan's murder, and how Duncan was buried in an unmarked grave. She remarks, "They say the dead don't rest without a marker of some kind." QUESTIONS: Why did the Stranger ride out of town the next morning? Who did the Stranger fine? What color did the people paint the town? What happen when the gunfighters hit town? MY THOUGHTS: To me this movie was kind of had a very slow pace to it. You knew the climax long before it happen which made this movie boring. I thought that Clint Eastwood did great in his role as the Stranger. However, there was no one backing him up. The other thing missing in this movie was a leading lady. There really wasn't any actress that stood out in this movie. To me you can't have a good movie without a leading lady. Therefore based on the lack of the leading lady and not that much action I give this movie 5 weasel stars</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Grim, Violent Western with a Surreal Touch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>High Plains Drifter is a difficult movie to characterize, combining graphic violence with a thoughtful, even philosophical approach. The film starts with a worn out Western premise, as a town hires a gunfighter to protect it from vengeful outlaws. However, the film takes an unexpected direction, exploring the corruption of the small town and the concept of retribution.One of the film's most interesting aspects is its subtle critique of the Western hero. At times, the film implicitly condemns the townspeople for needing a hero, rather than standing up for themselves. They get far more than they bargained for in Eastwood's Stranger, a borderline homicidal maniac with a penchant for rape.High Plains Drifter combines the artsy with the action, and delivers more than its share of the violence. It is best appreciated by those with a taste for thoughtful westerns, and can be seen as a prequel to Eastwood's later Unforgiven.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Conceptual western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Clint Eastwood, having achieved world top box office draw status by way of spaghetti westerns (built on traditional TV westerns) never lost the opportunity to go somewhere a little bit different, and High Plains Drifter was one of his earliest ventures off the beaten track.While undoubtedly a western, High Plains Drifter takes the bold step of cross pollinating the western genre with a revenge plot and an oblique supernatural story. Eastwood, the drifter of the title, arrives in the town of Lago, only to be recruited by the townsfolk in a solitary Magnificent Seven role to defend them against revenge-bent criminals newly released from jail. It turns out that Eastwood's stranger has some revenge of his own in mind, on not only the crooks but also the townspeople, for he appears to be (it is not spelled out) the reincarnation of the lawman they failed to support when the crooks last came to call.This was a bold and original scenario for a western but, under Eastwood's knowing directorship, it succeeds admirably, having a distinctly otherwordly atmosphere underling the traditional western trappings.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Painting the town red</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It becomes clear from the beginning of the story the strange man we see arriving at a desolate Western town has his own agenda. We watch him riding on his horse throughout the town, as though he were inspecting it. His visit to the saloon is met with nervousness because he never speaks to anyone. When three men decide to challenge him, they are surprised by the quickness this guy reacts to their threats. Not content with disposing of these scum bags, he takes an insulting woman to a remote spot where he shows her not to mess with him ever again!The higher ups in the mining town decide to engage him. His price turns out to be high. The merchants realize this weird character is what they need to defend them after three notorious bandits are freed from a nearby jail. These bad guys are paying for the crime of torturing and killing the last sheriff in the small town. The powerful people decide to give him free spending in getting what he wants in order to secure his services.The stranger proves to have expensive tastes, something the owners of the main businesses didn't count on. The stranger takes whatever strike his fancy. To irritate everyone he decides to appoint the dwarf that is the object of ridicule, as the new sheriff. He decides to paint the whole town red in preparation of the arrival of the three bandits, and renames it Hell. The stranger proves he is a step ahead when it comes to dealing with the three bad guys.This was Clint Eastwood's second film as a director. He took the Ernest Tydyman's screenplay and turned it into a surprising Western that gave him an opportunity in which to shine. His character is one of the darkest gun men of the West. This was an introspective man that saw the evil ways in which an honest sheriff was killed senselessly. He wanted blood and to avenge his death.Being a director who must direct himself, Mr. Eastwood did a fine job in the finished product. While he is on camera most of the time, there are also satisfying performances from the cast. Verna Bloom appears as the disgusted wife of the hotel owner. Mitchell Ryan, a wonderful actor doesn't have much to do within the large cast assembled. Billy Curtis made a good impression as Mordecai, the dwarf turned sheriff. John Hillerman, who went to have a principal part in "Magnum P.I" has a small part here.Bruce Surtees, the cinematographer, was a favorite of both Mr. Eastwood and Don Siegel. He captured the vast panorama of the locations in which the film was set, notably Mono Lake, the Sierra Nevada Mountains of California, and the other sites. Dee Barton contributed to the soundtrack.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Perhaps my favorite Clint Eastwood Western!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>HIGH PLAINS DRIFTER is one of the most unique Westerns ever! Directed and starring the great Clint Eastwood as a no-named stranger who drifts into town (what else is new!), DRIFTER is Eastwood's first Western that he actually directed, and you can see the influence of the 2 directors who had the most impact on Clint Eastwood's career (Sergio Leone and Don Siegel) in this absorbing, surreal, ominous, satisfying film. DRIFTER is an combination of those director's styles. It has the expansiveness (shot in the desert) and a large cast of diverse characters you'd expect to see in a Leone Western, but also there are a lot of intimate, intense scenes of character interaction that Siegel specialized in. Of course it has showdowns! All of which are expertly filmed by the ever-so-attentive film student Mr. Eastwood! DRIFTER starts out similar to those Eastwood-Leone Westerns with a catchy opening tune (although this one is way more dark than the ones in Leone's films) and it immediately draws you in to the story. Eastwood's no-name character rides into the desert burg Lago and is greeted with instant disdain, contempt, curiosity, and fear by the town residents. The opening tracking shot of Eastwood riding in on his horse with all the townsfolk looking on is film-making at it's best! Each character is introduced with just looks and facial expressions and you can tell what each one is about immediately! The town of Lago had hired 3 killers (led by an appropriately evil Geoffrey Lewis) to whip and beat the town marshal to death. We find this out in a strange dream that Eastwood has. Which begs the question: How did Eastwood's character know about this? He is obviously a stranger since no one in town has ever seen him before and was not there when the marshal was killed (or was he?). This is the big, unanswered question of DRIFTER. Is Eastwood related to the character (brother, perhaps)? Did the spirit of the marshal somehow occupy Eastwood's body and demand revenge? Or he Eastwood a ghost? Never really answered until the end when Eastwood tells the town dwarf Mordecai (memorably played by Billy Curtis), who is putting the headstone on the marshal's grave, that he already knows who he is! And even here we are still not sure! All we know is that Eastwood left town the same way he arrived, like a mirage! Eastwood comes in and takes over the town in exchange for helping them get rid of the 3 killers who have been released from prison (the townsfolk turned on them after the marshal's death and had them put away). This manipulation is reminiscent of A FISTFUL OF DOLLARS where Eastwood played sides against each other, but with a hidden agenda that had nothing to do with money!The excellent cast includes Stefan Gierasch (as the town mayor), Mitchell Ryan (as the local businessman), Walter Barnes (as the town sheriff), Ted Hartley (as the hotel owner), Verna Bloom (as hotelier's wife), Marianna Hill (town slut who Eastwood's character actually rapes early in the film), John Hillerman (as a shoe salesman), and Anthony James (as one of the 3 killers).HIGH PLAINS DRIFTER proves that Eastwood ranks not just among the elite Western directors, but the elite directors period!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Clint Eastwood vehicle playing his usual character as avenger gunslinger</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This violent Western is set on Northern outdoors and the star is a mysterious revenger, ¨a man without name¨ , who comes to the aid of embattled citizens. It deals about a gunfighter (Clint Eastwood) arriving a little town called Lago that has the usual shops and buildings, as General merchandise, Livery stable, Hardware, Barber shop, Saloon , Hotel and of course the Church. The drifter donning his six-guns is contracted by townspeople to protect them from a trio of avenge-seeking outlaws(Geoffrey Lewis, Dan Vadis, Anthony James)who have justly released from jail. But the villagers wind up painting the little town and calling it : ¨Hell¨.Well crafted Western with interesting screenplay by Ernest Tidyman. Although atmospheric , it's also downbeat and sometimes just downright nasty. The story is almost terrific as the drifter comes to strange frontier town just in time to reckoning villagers and bandits. This stirring picture contains a powerful examination of morality and hypocrisy on people of a little town. Good casting with several secondaries as Michell Ryan, Marianna Hill, Verna Bloom, Walter Barnes, Robert Donner and special mention to Billy Curtis as midget become Sheriff and Mayor. Exquisitely shot by Robert Surtees with a magnificent cinematography on the barren exteriors and snowy mountains backgrounds. Thrilling and suspenseful musical score by Dee Burton. The film is made in somewhat similar style to ¨Pale rider (1985)¨, only this time the drifter appears to have been sent from hell rather than heaven to right from ordinary injustices. Later on, Eastwood produced and directed another successful Western ¨Unforgiven(1992)¨ also with some common theme.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Drifter" has a unique place in the Greatest Westerns ever.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fade in. We see a sprawling vista of a desert against a mountainous backdrop. Everything lit into hazy gold by the scorching sun. The dust, unsettling and disturbed. In the distance,a blurred horseman is riding towards the screen, slowly taking form. He is The Stranger, a man with no name, a drifter with no past and no apparent purpose but to seek retribution for the sins of the people in the town of Lago.Thus opens Clint Eastwood's first directorial effort in the genre that made his legend.. A stranger rides into the town of Lago, his pale horse and his bestubbled face attracting the curious and worried glances of the townspeople. The stranger's horse moving at a slow sinister gait. He stops and dismounts to enter a saloon.. he asks for a drink, only to be taunted by a bored gunman:" Flea-bitten range-bums don't usually stop in Lago. Life here is a little too quick for them. Maybe you think you're fast enough to keep up with us..."the stranger, laconic and cool..replies:"I'm faster than you'll ever live to be...."A little later, the stranger kills the pompous gunman and his two cohorts. Just minutes after, he meets the town beauty with a sharp tongue and punishes her by raping her inside a barn in broad daylight.He is now the most feared man in Lago.He then checks in at the town hotel, the man at the desk asks him to register and give his name, but the stranger won't, leaving us in utter bewilderment even more as to the identity of this man. The townspeople too, are perplexed. As the stranger lies down on the bed, a flashback dissolves onto the screen, showing a man, who turns out to be their former Marshal Jim Duncan, down on all fours, being whipped to death by three men. The townsfolk looking on, indifferent to the fate and the pathetic cries of help from their OWN marshal. Moments before the marshal's death, he cursed: "Damn You ALL People To HELL"...With this flashback, we know that The Stranger is connected in some way to the marshal, whose death was caused or at least permitted by the townspeople, but the key question is How? With Clint Eastwood purposely depriving us (Genius!) of a clear connection between the Stranger and the Marshal (i.e. He refused to give his name in the Hotel, they could be brothers) interpretations of character of The Stranger spring to mind. The Stranger could be the personification of the town's collective shame and guilt that had long been consuming their souls. He is the manifestation of a life that is beset with fear,.. and of SINS.When three outlaws are released from prison and plan to make the town of Lago pay for their lost time, the townspeople, consumed by fear, turn to The Stranger for protection, in exchange for ANYTHING the Stranger wants.Just as Fear corrupts a person's dignity, so does The Stranger as he moves around town getting his hoggish share of "freebies" from the town's merchants. Leather and goods, food and shelter (having the whole Hotel emptied for him to shack in).These atrocities, strangely enough, seemed ineffective in soliciting sympathy for the townspeople because they are portrayed as cowards, selfish and undignified.The Stranger prepares the town for battle but will he stay to help them? or will he leave these deplorable people to fend for themselves? DO COWARDS DESERVE PROTECTION? These questions, reminiscent in a way of Snyder's essay "A Nation of Cowards" are put forth by the movie, but in the ending,. The Stranger did protect the town, but only after the town had suffered a great deal did he step in.High Plains Drifter is a metaphysical western, it is intelligent, rich thematically but very entertaining and even funny. It might not be the best Eastwood western but it certainly has the distinction of being the most unique.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Greatest Supernatural Western of All Time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"High Plains Drifter" represented Clint Eastwood's second turn behind the camera as a director after "Play Misty for Me," and this rugged, scenic western shoot'em up qualifies as the greatest supernatural western saga ever made. Eastwood learned a thing or two about directing from Sergio Leone. Compare the Man with No Name's entrance into San Miguel in "Fistful of Dollars" with the Stranger's entrance into Lago, and you can see that Leone heavily influenced Eastwood. Shot for shot, Eastwood duplicates Leone, but adds his own neat touches. The sound of the horses' hooves shuffling through the sand and the variety of camera angles as the Stranger rides down the street is nothing short of brilliant. Later, during a night-time shoot-out after several men try to beat the anti-heroic protagonist to death as he lies asleep in bed, Eastwood pays homage to Don Siegel. He grips his Colt's .45 revolver the way he did in Siegel's "Dirty Harry." Just as a robber was blasted backwards by Harry Callahan through a storefront display window, the Stranger nails an assailant with a slug that propels him through a storefront window. This lean, mean western is a study in economy. Eastwood directs with a sure hand. If you don't pay close attention to the action, you'd never guess that this is a ghost western. Imagine "The Fiend that Walked the West" crossed with "High Noon" and you'll have a good idea what to expect from "High Plains Drifter." From the first image of Eastwood's duster-clad Stranger riding through a heat mirage to the last image of him vanishing into the same heat mirage, this is unmistakably a ghost western. Dee Barton's eerie music contributes to the moody atmosphere of this saga. Later, the hotel keeper's wife observes that perhaps the dead don't rest in an unmarked grave. One of the last shots in "High Plains Drifter" is the dwarf painting a name on a tombstone.The frontier town of Lago lives in fear. Something terrible happened one night on their dark streets that the townspeople have never forgotten. Three unrepentant ruffians, Stacy Bridges (Geoffrey Lewis of "Every Which Way but Loose"), Cole Carlin (Anthony James of "Unforgiven"), and Dan Carlin (Dan Vadis of "Triumph of the Ten Gladiators"), killed Lago City Marshal Jim Duncan (stunt man Buddy Van Horn) with bull whips. The entire town watched as these three hellions whipped the lawman to death. Nobody raised a finger to stop them. The men who formed the conspiracy, Dave Drake (Mitchell Ryan of "Magnum Force") and Morgan Allen (Jack Ging), operate a mining company. They learned that upright, honest Marshal Duncan had discovered they were excavating gold from government land and he threatened to inform the authorities. Drake and Allen hired Bridges and the Carlin brothers to kill Duncan. Afterward, they planted a gold ingot where these killers lived, framed them for a robbery, and had them sent to prison. As "High Plains Drifter" opens, this murderous trio has just been released from prison and they are heading straight to Lago to square accounts.Meanwhile, the paranoid citizens of Lago have hired three gunslingers to run strangers out of town. The Stranger (Clint Eastwood of "Joe Kidd") arrives to get a bottle of whiskey, and tough guy Billy Borders and his two cohorts try to run him off. He leaves the bar and takes a chair in the barbershop across the street. Borders and company follow him. They try to kill him while he is getting shaved. They believe he is unarmed, but he has faked them off by putting a carved piece of wood in his holster. When they try to make their move, he blows all three of them away without a qualm. Drake sends Sheriff Sam Shaw (Spaghetti western actor Walter Barnes) over to offer him a proposition. The Stranger can have anything in town he wants for free if he will protect them from Bridges and the Carlin boys. The Stranger accepts their offer and promptly ridicules them by appropriating Shaw's badge and pinning it on the town midget, Mordecai. Mordecai revels in his new found importance and angers several of the leading citizens. This subplot is reminiscent of the Lee Van Cleef spaghetti western "Day of Anger" where the hero made a gunslinger out of the town tramp and the citizens had to bow and scrape to him. Furthermore, the Stranger makes the town mayor Jason Hobart (Stefan Gierasch of "What's up Doc") give an Indian a pile of blankets and jars of candy for his kids. The Stranger forms the Lago Volunteers and drills the cowardly townspeople in the art of ambush. Meanwhile, he makes Mexican laborers tear down a barn to build picnic tables and he has the citizens paint their town red. The Stranger rides out to the town sign and paints HELL over Lago, and then abandons Lago when Stacy and the Carlin brothers hit the town like marauders. The final shoot out in Lago at night with orange flames licking the buildings and back lighting the action makes for a fantastic mise-en-scene! The cast is uniformly excellent. Geoffrey Lewis is superb as the revenge ravenous Stacy. Eastwood's old co-star from his TV series "Rawhide" Paul Brinegar plays the barkeeper, and in a pre-"Magnum, P.I." role, John Hillerman plays the boot maker. Bruce Surtees' widescreen cinematography is striking. Eastwood couldn't have chosen a better looking location on Lake Mono in the California Sierras. Ernst Tidyman, who won an Oscar for "The French Connection" and "Dirty Harry's" Dean Riesner provide several memorable lines of dialogue. "High Plains Drifter" resembles a Spaghetti western with respect to its arid setting and its swift-shooting gunslinger protagonist. The imaginative use of bullwhips rather than rifles adds immeasurably to the action. Eastwood's wry, understated sense of humor shines through every scene. This is a superior western, far better than the lame "High'em High."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Avenging Angel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Clint Eastwood gives notice here of the major directorial talent he would come to be ? arguably the best working in America at the moment ? with this supernatural slant on his 'Man With No Name' persona from Leone's spaghetti westerns. Here he plays the familiar monosyllabic stranger, riding out of the desert to dispense some righteous justice on both the townsfolk therein and the bad guys who killed the town's marshal and who are on their way back after a spell in prison to seek retribution against the folk who put them away.Eastwood's character may or may not be some kind of avenging angel ? he certainly supplies plenty of visual hints and has his character survive a near-point blank shooting from a woman he raped by merely sinking beneath the water in his bath. It's this ambiguity that makes the film, really. Had the stranger been clearly identified as a ghost/demon/angel assigned to deliver a hellish version of divine retribution, or the revenge-seeking brother of the marshal whipped to death by the bad guys as the townspeople looked on, the film would have been flat and unremarkable, but leaving his motives clouded in mystery adds another layer to the otherwise routine story. Either way, the film entertains on a grand scale. The townspeople are ? with a couple of exceptions ? rotten to the core behind their normal facades, and it is watching their come-uppance dished out in measured, unpalatable servings, rather than by the report of a gun, that contributes towards a major share of the enjoyment.The town and its people, beneath their everyday appearance, are equally spooky. The buildings distanced apart, barely any women around and no children at all. It's as if they are already in limbo, unknowingly killing time as they await their collective fate.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Clint Eastwood's strangest and most startling Western ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The lethal and mysterious the Stranger (Clint Eastwood in peak steely and formidable form) arrives in the seedy and lawless coastal community of Lago. The cowardly citizens hire the Stranger to protect them from a trio of dangerous criminals who've just been released from prison. The Stranger proceeds to turn the place upside down: he rapes fiery harlot Callie Travers (the gorgeous Marianna Hill), makes persecuted midget Mordecai (a marvelous performance by Billy Curtis) both sheriff and mayor, repaints the burg red, and renames it Hell. Director Eastwood, adapting an intriguingly cryptic script by Oscar-winning screenwriter Ernest Tidyman (who previously penned "Shaft" and "The French Connection"), crafts an arrestingly stark, dark and brutal nihilistic stunner that turns standard Western conventions completely on their ear: the beleaguered townspeople are all contemptible weaklings, the outlaws actually have a valid beef against the hamlet, and the Stranger makes for a genuinely scary, ruthless and vicious anti-heroic bastard of an avenging angel of death. Moreover, the handsome cinematography by Bruce Surtees, the odd, eerie, quasi-supernatural Gothic horror-Western tone, the unsparingly harsh amoral sensibility, Dee Barton's spooky score, a sharp streak of wickedly deadpan pitch-black humor, the laconic dialogue, and several jolting outbursts of savage violence all add up to one remarkably bizarre and haunting one-of-a-kind doozy. The bang-up acting from a terrific cast of familiar faces rates as another substantial asset: Verna Bloom as the disapproving Sarah Belding, Mitchell Ryan as crooked sycophantic mining company boss Dave Drake, Jack Ging as sniveling hotelier Morgan Allen, Stefan Gierasch as the ineffectual Mayor Jason Hobart, Walter Barnes as the folksy Sheriff Sam Shaw, Robert Donner as a hypocritical preacher, and Geoffrey Lewis, Scott Walker, and Anthony James as the three mangy no-count outlaws. A real gritty gem.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Clint is at his mysterious best in this one. Perhaps his closest other movie to this would be "The Pale Rider". Certainly, they do not have the same plots, not even remotely, but they both have an air of mystery to them.Clint is once again defending the weak and fighting injustice, this time, on a very personal level.Seems a bit irreverent (lol), but little Jimmy Dickens plays a very convincing part in this shoot-'em-up as, what else, Clint's sidekick and most avid supporter, this time. No more about that, though. You'll have to watch to figure out exactly what that means.Similar to "Pale Rider", our hero gets the girl, but he once again rides into the sunset alone. He just can't seem to settle down, can he? In a twist, he's not in Mexico this time. In fact, he's quite familiar with his surroundings, but the movie unfolds in such a way as to allow that tenuous connection to develop teasingly slowly; very-well done. In fact, it continues to develop as the movie trails off.If you haven't unraveled the mystery by the end of the movie, don't panic. Clint reveals all in his parting remarks to his dear friend. You'll have to be quick, though. Clint's never been long on verbiage, and this is no exception. When he does speak, however, it is a good idea to listen closely. You'll only get one last chance. lol Well, I hope you enjoy the movie as much as I have. I don't know how many times I've seen this one, but it's one of my Clint Eastwood favorites.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Saw this flick again for the ??? time. But this time I saw something that I hadn't seen earlier. "The stranger" is like a biblical figure that has the ability to see, feel and have indicative dreams about "evil". Rides into "Lago" from nowhere only to find himself in a town whose residents are consumed by dark forces. Without provocation he is dragged into situations where he has no choice but to take care of the problems without hesitation. Even when he encounters the first woman in town whom he takes, she was only seeking contact even though through insults. They reluctantly realize that he has the ability to help and save them from outlaws. And since they were unable to ward of the threats from the outlaws themselves, they painfully needed "The stranger" even though it meant to sacrifice themselves materially to his demands. When asked by "Mordecai" at the end what his name is, "The stranger" only says that he already knows. This film has it all and that's why I gave it a ten.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Is Clint Bad Or Good? Both</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>High Plains Drifter(1972) is Clint Eastwood's tribute to the Speghetti Westerns of Sergio Leone. In fact this film can be seen as an American Speghetti Western. High Plains Drifter is a Western-Noir because most of the cast of characters(even the hero) is not a clear cut hero. Clint Eastwood gives a good performance balancing between hero and villain. This was done as a homage to his mentor Sergio Leone who played a important role in his directorial career.This film is better than Unforgiven(1992) because the main character is a man of a more vengeful and brutal nature. This is of Eastwood's early masterpieces as director. One of the best scenes is when he has the whole town painted red and renames it hell. Clint Eastwood would play a ghost again in Pale Rider but without the same viciousness he displays in High Plains Drifter(1972). This will be known to movie buffs as the film where Clint Eastwood rapes someone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Strangest Western I've Ever Seen!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILERSThis movie is one helluva of a weird western movie. There are no heroes in this film. We have the protagonist, played by Clint Eastwood's character. The protagonist, a mysterious stranger that comes into town, is enigmatic, definitely not likable, with questionable motives. The townspeople are pretty horrible people. I didn't like anyone of these people with the exception of the midget. The townspeople hire this mysterious stranger to save their town. But was does the mysterious stranger do instead? He destroys practically everyone and leaves the town in ruins. This is not an easy movie to watch, but it is endlessly fascinating.I didn't much care for the rape scene between Clint's character and the town prostitute. It was disgusting and disturbing. It's like, this woman's a bitch so she deserves what she gets. The other woman that is forced to sleep with Clint's character obviously forgives him the next day. She becomes nice to the protagonist and decides to leave town for good. I don't like the way how this film treats its' females. Females in "High Plains Drifter" are powerless, victims, and generally treated like crap. That is the only complaint I have about this movie.There are a lot of supernatural elements in this movie. Is the mysterious stranger somehow related to the murdered town sheriff? Is he a spirit out for vengeance? The last five minutes of the movie, the midget sees the mysterious protagonist ride away and disappear into the mists. What a cool way to end a Western.Clint Eastwood is very good in this movie. I think that's why I keep watching this movie every time it pops up on cable TV. It always makes me wonder just who or what this mysterious stranger is, was.Watch this movie yourself and decide.Definitely recommended for anyone who enjoys Clint Eastwood movies. This movie is a great classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>High Plains Drifter (1973)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Clint Eastwood's follow-up to his immensely promising directorial debut (Play Misty For Me) also marks the first of his numerous outings as director into the western genre; it also sets up the dark tone that would reach its peak in his Oscar-winning masterpiece, Unforgiven (1992). Following in the tradition of Sergio Leone's classic "Man With No Name" trilogy (Fistful of Dollars, For a Few Dollars More, and The Good, The Bad, and the Ugly), High Plains Drifter (1973) is the story of a mysterious stranger who wanders into a small town expecting a drink and a hot bath, but ends up having to protect the citizens from three soon-to-be-released gunfighters who had threatened to return and avenge their arrest. While the plot isn't original per se, its development and its characters set it apart from the myriad of similar features that came before it: instead of being a mere conflict between good and evil, Eastwood blurs this line and delivers a bleak film about human nature that stands as a prime example of the film renaissance of the 70's. Clint Eastwood plays the stranger not as a hero, but as an anti-hero; instead of reprising the John Wayne role of town savior, he more closely embodies the character of David in Sam Peckinpah's Straw Dogs. While some of the things he does appear to be good-natured -- example: using his unlimited credit in the town to buy blankets for penniless Indians --, there is nothing in his introduction that remotely resembles virtue: within the first 20 minutes of the film, he has murdered three men and raped a woman. And yet this is the character we end up rooting for -- which is exactly the type of avant-garde techniques that were popularized in this era of film. The screenplay by Ernest Tidyman (who won an Academy Award two years prior for The French Connection) is a seamless combination of the dry humor of the 60's westerns and the upcoming gloominess of the 70's; while there are plenty light moments to ease the overall heavy tone of the picture, he doesn't tie every loose end at the conclusion, leaving us a little to think about as we walk away. There are a number of unanswered questions, such as: is the drifter REALLY a stranger to this town? If so, why does he have a dream of events that took place there BEFORE he arrived? While I think I've solved these puzzles now, I'll leave it up to you to make up your own mind. As for the production itself, High Plains Drifter excels in every department: performances, direction, and writing are all top-of-the-line. There are even subtle references to fascism and dictatorship -- a good example of how even the most unlikely picture could still have political meaning if made in the 70's. High Plains Drifter is not without its flaws, but its originality and unusual depth more than make up for them. In preparation for the town's invaders, the stranger (literally) paints the town red and sarcastically writes "Hell" over the city sign; by the end of the movie, in which Eastwood is whipping a man to death in the middle of the street as flames lick the town up in the background, this is hardly a joke anymore. Because in the end, the townspeople have just traded three violent invaders for one.Grade: A-</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Classic Morality Play</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First, I do not see this film as a continuation of the Sergio Leone films, which were "high opera." The spaghetti western trilogy told simple stories, and had simple, tidy endings. This film is a character study, and it requires multiple viewings to absorb its nuances. And as for an ending? Pick one.I agree with those who find similarities in this film and in "Unforgiven," a film that did not work for me. This film, however, worked for me on many levels.Who exactly is Eastwood's character (the "stranger")? It isn't clear, but there are many clues, and the answer to the riddle keeps us returning to the film time after time. There is something between Eastwood's character and Verna Bloom's character. What is it? What does she know about the stranger? It's hard to say. She, herself, is a very eerie presence.Billy, who plays "Mordecai," nearly steals this film. Interestingly, he played the mayor of the Munchkins in "The Wizard of Oz." The sheriff is superb, and so is the barber (who shows up again in "The Outlaw Josie Wales" as the ferry operator). Where does Eastwood find these people?I thought the three "bad" guys were miscast. Geoffrey Lewis does not come across as a psychopath to me. On the other hand, I was happy to see that one of his buddies was the creepy guy who worked at the diner in "In the Heat of the Night." He could have played Norman Bates. It would have been better if the three gunslingers at the beginning of the film -- really bad looking dudes -- had switched roles with the three "bad" guys at the end of the film.This is a very stylish, if violent, movie, and the fact that it is a western is superfluous to the story it tells. In exposing the dark underbelly of the small town, the film reminds one of "Blue Velvet," which followed years later. This film isn't for everybody. One wonders if Eastwood deliberately made "The Outlaw Josie Wales" three years later to reassure fans that he could still make a traditional western. In fact, as a traditional western, "Josie" ranks with "She Wore a Yellow Ribbon," "The Searchers," "Shane," and "Red River." This film is not for traditionalists. It is a challenge for many. But, it pays off in so many ways, and I highly recommend it. 9 out of 10.  </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Edgy, classic Eastwood</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For what it is worth, I am not particularly an admirer of Clint Eastwood as a director. I find his sparse style generally uninspiring, and the tales he chooses to film tend to be overly simplistic. His earliest directorial efforts were his best, and he seems to have resorted more and more to formulas thereafter (with the exception of "Unforgiven"). The film he made about the Grenada conflict, "Heartbreak Ridge," springs to mind, and "Pale Rider" (in which basically nothing happens) as well. In the standard Eastwood directorial effort, the end is obvious, formulas abound, and Eastwood relies on his own character's enigmatic manliness to make some kind of Big Point."High Plains Drifter," though, is in my opinion his directorial masterpiece (along with the much later "Unforgiven"). I offer one scene as an example of original direction: after dispatching a few young punks in a bar in the formulaic "proving his gunfighter credentials" scene (predictable scenes are Eastwood's directorial nemesis), Eastwood's gunfighter checks into a hotel, goes to his room, drinks, passes out, has a nightmare that sets up the movie's revenge theme, awakens the next day, and walks out into the street past a woman who says nothing but stares at him. This all lasts what seems to be several minutes of screen time. Now, this may not sound like much, but it is a moody and successful move that brilliantly frames the rest of the film almost as a documentary of the mind and motivations of the gunfighter, as opposed to a standard shoot-em-up. It also shows a bit of the naturalistic style that was much over-used in later (non-Eastwood) films such as "Tom Horn."Favorite line in the film, in a "High Noon" townspeople-discussing -their-fate moment: "Our sherifff is about as much good in a gunfight as boots on a whore." I doubt he could get away with that line today. That the townspeople the gunfighter comes to "save" not only are chickens but actually are morally as bad as or worse than the gunfighters he is "protecting" them from turns the genre on its head and serves as the (very welcome) cynic's response to "High Noon."This film also established Eastwood's recurring stable of actors, such as the under-appreciated Geoffrey Lewis, John Quade and Dan Vadis. As for the general theme, I point to Mark Twain's short story "The Man that Corrupted Hadleyburg." Good direction, good supporting actors, good scenery, good story, good "life-is-tough" moral lesson (an Eastwood trademark) - this movie has it all if you like Westerns or Eastwood or just good films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Technically good, but morally wrong!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie leaves me with very mixed feelings. I can understand those who call it one of the best Westerns ever. In fact, it is quite well made and well acted. It really gripes the audience. But don't forget to look at the negative side: this movie really is excessively violent! Within the first quarter of on hour, the protagonist, played by Clint Eastwood himself, kills three men and rapes a woman. A devils advocate might argue that this is no celebration of gratuitous violence, that the protagonist is no hero, but an anti-hero. But I am afraid the protagonist might well be considered as a role model by some people. Especially testosteron tormented juveniles who are still in the process of consolidating their moral value system, might conclude - after seeing this film - that it is quite `cool' to massacre and rape. The ambivalent attitude of the raped young lady towards the protagonist might contribute in letting them believe that only those women get raped who really like it. I therefore conclude: this movie is technically good, but morally wrong.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'd give this movie some marks for being one of the most unique westerns I've ever seen. Clint Eastwood acts well in the movie and the action scenes are done well in my opinion.The main issue is that the main hero character rapes one woman and borderline forces another women to have sex with him. These scenes in and of itself wouldn't stop me watching a movie. It's quite different though when a movie sets up the rapist as the hero of the movie!You'll read a bunch of reviews about how this rapist goes to this town to dispense justice to cowardly townspeople who covered up a murder in relation to their mine. I'm sorry but that does not excuse rape. Clint Eastwood's character is meant to be an anti hero but he's not really. Ultimately his portrayal is far closer to a conventional hero than to say a Walter White.For a point of reference, I'm a man in my thirties. The 70s were definitely different in terms of attitudes to movies!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is essentially a Western Ghost story. Someone thought maybe he was the brother of the dead Marshall, but what we have is a story of a man wrongfully killed and then not given a final resting spot. As one of the characters in the movie states, "Without a headstone, the dead roam (paraphrase)." Marshall Duncan was set up and murdered due to the greed of the town leaders and businesses. And the townspeople did nothing to stop or help. They, in the eyes of Marshall Duncan, are all guilty to some degree. Those that don't like the movie decry the violence and rape and thuggery of Clint. Well, it was because they were being punished for either their active participation in Marshall Duncan's murder, or their passive allowance of it. Oh, he is after the actual perpetrators, for sure, but everyone must be punished. The whole town. There are no innocent people, you see. Not in this town, at least.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Eastwood Redefines the Antihero, in Dark and Gritty Western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"High Plains Drifter" of 1973 is a gritty, dark and exceptional Western which proves that Clint Eastwood is doubtlessly one of the most memorable individuals ever in cinema, both as a brilliant actor and great director. Several years after embodying the Western anti-hero, the 'Man With No Name' in Sergio Leone's brilliant Dollar-trilogy, which culminated in the matchless masterpiece "The Good, The Bad and The Ugly" of 1966 (the all-time greatest Western, and, in my opinion, one of the greatest films ever made), Eastwood reprises the role of the nameless stranger - and creates an antihero incomparably more ruthless than the role he owes his fame to. "High Plains Drifter" was Eastwood's second feature-length film as a director. I am not the biggest fan of his debut, the 1971 thriller "Play Misty For Me" (which is doubtlessly more than decent, though), and would personally regard "High Plains Drifter" as Eastwood's first directorial masterwork. The film is an incredibly dark, gritty and sometimes obscure Western with many elements of a supernatural Thriller. It's protagonist is an antihero with a stress on the 'anti' - ruthless, violent and cold-blooded. It is not surprising that the first Western directed by the most famous star of the Spaghetti Western is also arguably THE American Western which could most easily be mistaken for an Italian one. It were the Italian Westerns which made the Genre gritty and turned its heroes into antiheroes, and "High Plains Drifter" epitomizes these aspects.A nameless stranger (Eastwood) comes to a small lakeside town in the West called Lago. By proving his talent as a gunman, he quickly establishes his superiority over the, initially hostile, townspeople, who subsequently ask for his protection against a bunch of outlaws. The stranger is not the kind of person to give away his help out of good will, however...From the first sequence, "High Plains Drifter" is incredibly atmospheric. The music, the photography, the setting - it all goes perfectly in hand. The film brilliantly brings up the feeling of a supernatural Thriller with a highly uncanny undertone. Eastwood is brilliant in his role of the nameless stranger, a man more ruthless than the 'Man With No Name' in Leone's films. Then again, he is only ruthless towards the self-satisfied, hypocritical townspeople, who are more or less scumbags themselves - only weaker scumbags, that is. 'The Man With No Name' is arguably the all-time epitome of cinematic coolness. So is this 'Stranger' here, only that he is more aggressive, cynical and violent than Eastwood's earlier role. The rest of the cast is also good, especially worth mentioning are the two female cast members (The Stranger treats the two female characters vastly differently) Verena Bloom and especially Marianna Hill, whose character Callie is 'tought some manners' early in the film. "High Plains Drifter" may well be called Eastwood's first masterpiece as a director, and if I don't give it the full rating, it is just due to the superiority of Leone's films (especially "The Good, The Bad And The Ugly") to which it cannot quite compare - but that, no other film can. Overall, "High Plains Drifter" is a sublime first Western directed by Clint Eastwood, and along with films like "The Outlaw Josey Wales" and "Unforgiven" it stands among his greatest directorial works. Not to be missed!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Supernatural Western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one great western. (Spoilers to follow!!) Clint Eastwood outdoes himself with the eerie, surreal and sometimes horrific town of Lago and its visit from "The Stranger". What most people who watch this movie don't pick up on is (and I warned you about spoilers if you haven't seen it yet) The Stranger is the Marshal. He's back for revenge. Is he a ghost? Is he a reincarnated apparition? Or is he death himself coming to take the men who whipped him across to the other side? Or is it similar to Pale Rider, where the revenge is for the marshal that shot and nearly killed the Preacher. It is truly a reckoning for the outlaws and the town of Lago, either way you frame it. Lago's residents hide in fear rather than coming to the aid of the Marshal, who you only see in flashbacks from The Stranger's dreams. Upon hearing of the infamous gang's release, Lago's town council hires unsavory chaps to "guard" against their return. It's only hazy a bit here (and the only thing I can think of is Lago Mining company owes these bandits for running the Marshal out of town. I gather they did the owners of the mine a "service" and took it too far... so they got stiffed and turned in to the law.) Well, they're out of prison now and on their way back. The Stranger foils the town's plans by killing the gunslingers before he even gets a shave. Then the town is reluctantly obliged to hire the Stranger to protect them. He runs roughshod over everyone and treats the people as if they were cattle. Then in an elaborate scheme of red paint, a picnic feast and renaming the town to "Hell".. The Stranger gets his revenge on those who whipped him before.The reason I believe he's the Marshal is the ending... Mordecai asks one last time what his name was, as Mordecai is carving the Marshal's tombstone, and The Stranger says "you already know" (or words to that effect.) Meaning, Mordecai was the only one who knew he was the Marshal... and off The Stranger goes into the heat of nowhere... and that eerie music plays him out. A fine movie by Eastwood and one of his best non-Italian westerns (second only to the almighty Josey Wales..)I love this movie. If you are a fan of Westerns, you will too. But it's not the John Ford style white/black hat battles that make this movie so great. It's the moral ambiguity and indictment of a town too spineless to get involved. They pay the price for it in the end, as the town is burned to the ground and all those who could've helped but didn't are left to view the ashes of their possessions and realize their error...</fullReview>

He sticks with a realistic vision of the west instead of some campy cowboy film ,filmed on a Hollywood lot with flashy costumes scripts full of clichés.His vision of the west is the most authentic . The influence of Sergio Leone is evident from the start ,but he takes the essence of the spaghetti western and projected his vision in to the film.This gem was the first in a long line of great Eastwood films</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>an enigmatic western that distinctly marks Eastwood the star as director</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>High Plains Drifter will have you and your friends talking, arguing about what happened when and who was really killed, but it's the mystery surrounding the film that elevates it past its spaghetti-western roots. Eastwood has learned from the masters (hence the names on the tombstones- Leone and Siegel- as a tip-of-the-hat if not an entire farewell), and goes past it a little to tell another story of a ruthless gunslinger. Only here the stakes are raised; gone is the gunslinger of Leone's films where money was all that mattered and a good cigar in tow. Also gone is the slightly comic character of Two Mules for Sister Sara. The Stranger is a spooky cat, a guy who rides into a town, 'gets rid' of some bad dudes, and then demands that his services be met to get rid of some more that they need, without letting the town know he's really out for a whole other kind of revenge.There's a sensibility here that reveals Eastwood as a stylist, not merely the simplistic storyteller he's been pegged by some critics (albeit many have now come around following what could also be argued as showy strokes in Million Dollar Baby and his Iwo Jima movies). He lets it go like a western should, most of the time, with tense wide-shots and close-ups, directed for the story. But then those flashbacks; it's like we can't be sure what's coming, except that it's brutality, revealed like a feverish nightmare. And as the film goes on, the sinister edge that Eastwood has on Tidyman's script grows more and more, and the existentialism of the westerns of the period peels away to a much more hopeless realm. Is there any chance of any redemption? While maybe not as iconic as those classic Italian productions, or even as deep and sorrowful as Eastwood's own Unforgiven, High Plains Drifter has little spurts of pitch black humor (there is one killing scene that, perhaps unintentionally, brings it out, plus the classic exchange between the little guy and the Stranger: "You didn't say your name" "I didn't"), blood-curdling violence, and a chilling human element. It's a near masterpiece.</fullReview>

As much as I like almost anything he has done, this move stands on top as my favorite Eastwood Western.It was the second film he directed, and the first western. He returns as The Man With No Name, seeking revenge for something that happened in the past.He does an outstanding job, and is joined by a great cast that included Geoffrey lewis (The Devil's Rejects). It is a story that keeps you guessing and is full of action starting with a rape in the beginning and ending with a town in flames.This is Eastwood at his best.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Clint Eastwood as a metaphorical, merciless vengeance-demon from hell</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Last weekend I was in a western mood, so I watched HIGH PLAINS DRIFTER and THE WILD BUNCH in a row. Though I might not be the greatest western 'conaisseur', I must say that HIGH PLAINS DRIFTER is perhaps my favorite western and possibly one of the best ones out there. It's different, dark and foreboding. And it's a slow tension-builder.The deserted plains during the opening-credits and the atmospheric soundtrack pull you in right away. Almost the entire film takes place in an isolated small town (with only one street), which adds up to the desolate feeling of the movie. Clint Eastwood proves himself a masterful director by unfolding the plot step by step, slowly giving more and more information, and choosing subtle yet original camera angles.I'll try not to reveal too much about the plot. Clint arrives in a town at more or less at the same moment three criminals are released from a far away prison. The town seems to have a dark secret and fears the return of the criminals. So they hire Clint to protect them.Eastwood is simply amazing, and though his character is not really likable, you can't help but respect him. Every single spoken line of his is memorable and injected with grim &amp; black humor. I simple love the way his character is introduced in this film: He enters the town on his horse, buys a beer and a bottle of liquor in the local bar, goes to the barber-shop, kills three bad guys with three shots while having a shave, walks out to the street, grabs the local beauty-queen and rapes her. All this in the first 15 minutes of the movie!!! Eat that, John Wayne!The cool thing is that we know almost nothing about Clint's character, The Stranger, except that he's driven by personal demons of the past. An ingenious move, I'd say, Mr. Eastwood. Though we never know his identity, we do get a big hint at the end about who he might be. The acting of the complete cast is good but Clint steals the show. The three criminals are sadistic, brutal killers (example: driving a wooden stake through someone's throat and laughing at the amount of blood that comes out) and the final showdown at the end is satisfying.So HIGH PLAINS DRIFTER has got a lot of typical western ingredients but in fact isn't your typical western at all. It's different in a dark and violent kinda way with a strange type of protagonist. I saw this movie together with a friend who'd seen more westerns than me already. He was pleasantly surprised by this movie, so that proves my statement that HIGH PLAINS DRIFTER is a must see (even if you're not a big western-fan, I might add).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Various Shades of Black</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"High Plains Drifter" was the second film directed by Clint Eastwood (after "Play Misty for Me"), and the first Western. The theme- the efforts of a small mining town to defend itself against a gang of criminals with the help of a mysterious outsider- is very similar to that of a later Eastwood Western, "Pale Rider". The character played here by Eastwood, referred to only as The Stranger, is also reminiscent of an earlier Eastwood hero, the Man with No Name in the "Dollars" trilogy of spaghetti Westerns he made with Sergio Leone. Not only is he nameless, he is also laconic, soft-spoken, cigar-chewing and capable of ruthlessness when it suits his interests.The differences between "High Plains Drifter" and "Pale Rider" perhaps reflect the differences between the periods in which they were made. In the sixties and early seventies there was a trend towards "revisionist" Westerns such as Peckinpah's "The Wild Bunch" or Altman's "McCabe and Mrs Miller", films which called into question the moral certainties on which many earlier Westerns had been based. The causes of this tendency have been debated, but one influence seems to have been a decline in American patriotism and self-confidence deriving from factors such as the Vietnam War and the Watergate scandal."High Plains Drifter", dating from 1973, falls (in some respects at least) within the revisionist tradition. The inhabitants of the mining town of Lago are not innocent victims of a criminal gang but are themselves guilty of corruption and physical cowardice and are, in part, themselves to blame for the predicament in which they find themselves. The Stranger is no clean-cut, all-American hero; within a short while of his arrival in Lago he has shot dead three men in circumstances which only doubtfully amount to self-defence and has raped a woman. (Like a number of Eastwood's other films- "The Beguiled", "Play Misty for Me" and "The Gauntlet" come to mind- this one has a misogynistic streak running through it).By the time "Pale Rider" was made in the Reagan era of the mid-eighties, America's self-confidence was reviving, and although very few Westerns were being made during that period the old moral certainties were being revived in other genres, with movies like the "Star Wars", "Superman" and "Indiana Jones" franchises. It is therefore perhaps not surprising that "Pale Rider", like Lawrence Kasdan's "Silverado" made around the same time, is much less revisionist than "High Plains Drifter". There is a much sharper moral distinction between the miners and their villainous adversaries and the mysterious gunfighter who comes to their aid is much more unambiguously heroic.Both films have supernatural overtones, with a suggestion that the characters played by Eastwood are ghosts returned from the dead to seek revenge on those who wronged them in their lifetimes. In "Pale Rider" those overtones are not only supernatural but also religious; Eastwood's character is referred to as The Preacher and he is explicitly linked with one of the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse. ("Behold a pale horse, and his name that sat upon him was Death"). No direct suggestion is made in "Pale Rider" as to who The Preacher might have been in his lifetime, but in "High Plains Drifter" The Stranger is identified with Jim Duncan, the former Marshal of Lago who was whipped to death to prevent him from revealing that the mine upon which the town's prosperity depends had been illegally sunk on Government land. Eastwood, in fact, has said that the Stranger was originally to have been the dead man's brother, but he preferred a more mystical interpretation.The film is attractively photographed and competently directed; Eastwood's directorial style was clearly influenced by the directors he had previously worked with such as Leone and Don Siegel. The film-makers clearly went to some expense, building a complete Western town on the shores of Mono Lake, California; hence the name Lago. (The actors do not seem to have been in agreement as to how this name should be pronounced- most use the correct Spanish pronunciation, but some anglicise it to Lay-go).The film has been critically acclaimed, but it has never really been my favourite among Eastwood's movies. The makers of "revisionist" Westerns often claimed that, in the name of a greater realism, they were abandoning the sharp black/white moral distinctions which had once characterised the genre in favour of shades of grey. The trouble with "High Plains Drifter" is that there are really no shades of grey; Eastwood has simply abandoned white in favour of various shades of black. Lago may have no clean-cut heroes, but it has plenty of villains. The Stranger and his accomplices are little, if any, better than the outlaws. This may, or may not, be a more "realistic" portrayal of life in the Old West than the one given in films like "High Noon", but the implied supernatural elements in "High Plains Drifter" suggest that realism was not Eastwood's main concern. The film has its virtues, but for me the moral squalor of virtually all its characters means that it does not work as a traditional Western, and its mystical tendencies mean that it does not work as a revisionist one either. 6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent but disturbing movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is certainly one of Eastwood's more disturbing and darker ones. An excellent film about corruption and revenge in the Old West. Eastwood plays a drifter who wanders into a corrupt mining town. The townsfolk are hiding something. They are scared about three criminals who are being released from jail and coming to town. The townsfolk hire the drifter to protect them, after he kills the three men the town originally hired for protection.SPOILER Clint Eastwood IS Jim Duncan, the sheriff who was whipped and driven out of town. During the flashbacks, its Eastwood's voice. In the opening scene, Eastwood quickly turns his head towards the sound of a cracking whip, and finally in the very end, when the little guy is making a headstone for Jim Duncan, he says to Eastwood: "I never got your name" and Eastwood replies "You already know it". I think that is all pretty conclusive evidence for who he is in this excellent film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Firstly, in a interview, Clint said that he had heard people giving the 'Stranger' figure which is obviously portraying 'The Man with No Name' figure some sort of mysterious character when all it was was the brother of the dead marshall. Secondly,the woman that was raped was due to her immorallness and 'sluttness', after all when he is leaving she seems to have become more cobncious (plus of course she enjoyed clint giving her ''one'' as he must have had a lot of strength in him, after all he must of spent quite a lot of time without a woman). Thirdly, this movie reinforces the myth of the west, it was a hard, cruel and dirty no-go era. Furthermore, did you know that John Wayne diapproved of High Plains Drifter to such a extent that he wrote to Clint complaining to him about the film. Finally, did you know that in a interview (seperate to the previous interview, Clint said that one movie that he wanted to have more appreciation than it actually had was High Plains Drifter.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Man With No Name returns</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A spaghetti western with horror influences. Sounds like a film that was written by God, directed by Jesus and shot in heaven, and it is...well, almost. Although Clint Eastwood's horror-western is undoubtedly a very nice little story, it lacks the epic vision of the classic Leone films and so can't be considered in the same divine category that it could have been if it was. The film exudes a very low budget feel, most of which comes from the very small village that has been constructed and the fact that most of the acting is terrible. It doesn't matter, though, and these things actually add to the film in the long run as they lend it the classic spaghetti western feel. As you might expect, Clint plays the character he is best known for; the Man With No Name. Here, he takes that character to the extreme as he gives a very malevolent and uncaring performance, which is far from 'the Good'. The common shoot-out scenes are present, but Clint has also decided to include a rather graphic rape scene, which will no doubt offend some viewers.Clint Eastwood is a minimalist filmmaker. His directorial style is solid and unfussy and as anyone who's ever seen a Clint Eastwood film will know; he's a man of very few words. This is of obvious advantage to the film as it means that it remains efficient throughout, which engages the audience and ensures they don't get bored. The way Clint plays the character is magnificent, as he continually makes us believe that he is infallible; which is needed for the film to work. Eastwood also succeeds in creating a cerebral atmosphere, which gives the film it's element of fascination. The fact that Eastwood directs and stars makes this a big personal achievement for him personally also. As I say, this isn't the greatest spaghetti western of all time; but it's a long way from the worst and fans of Eastwood will be in heaven seeing him perform his greatest role again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lago, a town with many secrets</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the great western plots is the outsider stranger who comes to a town and one way or another rids it of its bad elements. A cliché best typified by Shane. In High Plains Drifter we have the town of Lago which sure doesn't look like much. A mysterious stranger comes to town played by Clint Eastwood and he's certainly up for the role of town savior. But as the film unfolds is Lago a town worth saving?The funny thing is that Eastwood himself did a variation on the plot of Shane in Pale Rider. He's as noble there as Alan Ladd was in Shane. But in High Plains Drifter his gunfighter skills are almost superhuman. And he's far from noble. His brooding presence frightens the town people but he might be their savior so like it or not, they put up with it though they don't like it.In fact the town's leading citizens are really a scurvy lot and the town has a lot of secrets. As you watch High Plains Drifter you wonder if the crowd is worth saving.It all works out the same as it does for Shane, but with one supernatural twist. In fact there's not another Clint Eastwood movie let alone western film where the supernatural comes in. It truly is a star vehicle for Eastwood, most of the supporting cast don't have enough to work with to create memorable characters. An exception is Barry Curtis, a midget who Eastwood elevates to prime importance and is really the only true friend the High Plains Drifter has.In fact High Plains Drifter has a ride into the sunset like no other.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It may not be Eastwood's best western, but it's a mean and moody piece of film-making</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>HIGH PLAINS DRIFTER is the first western that Clint Eastwood starred in that he also directed himself. While he gives a typically great performance as the titular character, the real surprise here comes from his matured, stylish direction that would have you thinking he'd been making these films for twenty years beforehand. This is an eerie western, laced through with violent flashbacks and an increasingly hellish atmosphere as it tells the story of corrupt townsfolk who watched a man die at the hands of three violent outlaws.It's one of those films where my attention was gripped for every moment. Eastwood doesn't play a likable character at all ? he starts off by raping a woman ? but the reason for that gradually becomes clear as the film progresses. The supporting cast of ne'er-do-wells is fine, although nobody gives a stand-out performance (apart from Billy Curtis as the kooky, lovable dwarf, Mordecai). Geoffrey Lewis pops up in an early role as one of the bad guys.The direction is superlative and the script avoids the typical clichés for the most part. I paid particular attention to the soundtrack, which combines eerie, dramatic effects with excellent music. The ending is one of those ones that actually exceeds audience expectations in terms of the dramatic tension, excitement, and plain good ol' fashioned filmmaking it excels in. This may not be Eastwood's best, but it sure as heck is up there with the best of them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More than just a drifter</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fearful of three recently released outlaws who murdered their previous sheriff, the citizens of a small Old West town hire a mysterious gunslinger to protect them, but the stranger knows more than he lets on this offbeat western with a 'Twilight Zone' style twist. While the twist at first feels like an afterthought, it begins to make more and more sense when one reconsiders prior events, and while the gunslinger initially seems merely heartless and cruel with the way he humiliates the townsfolk when given carte blanche and unlimited store credit for his services, all of this comes across as logical in the end. Plot turns aside, the film offers an interesting outlook on the risks of giving someone absolute power, and it is curiously debatable whether the townsfolk would be better off at the mercy of the outlaws than the very unpredictable stranger who enjoys raping their women, drinking all their booze and wrecking property where possible. Clint Eastwood plays the part well with a quiet charisma, but even as an antihero, he is a bit too dislikeable (making light of a violent rape; destroying buildings) for one to root for him - and given how despicable all of the townsfolk are shown to be, 'High Plains Drifter' is a film without a single likable character in sight. That said, there is perhaps something deliberate to this as the film noticeably plays against stereotypes of chivalry in the Old West. Indeed, while some have cited 'High Plains Drifter' as a supernatural western, it presents characters more flawed and down-to-earth than in most traditional westerns out there.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a marvelous film, and lays bare some of the ugliness all around us. Even an avenger is not pure. But it's less than Clint's best work. He kept improving his perspective on us, and triumphed in Gran Torino. There are several clues as to his jaundiced and incomplete understanding of righting wrongs. People touched by god, do divine work, they do not rape and or seduce vulnerable women. Maybe he is and maybe he's not an avenging angel returned to earth. Personally, I think he need not to have spoken to Mordecai as he leaves town. Plus the women he raped and seduced are unrealistically compliant / forgiving. That Clint has fortunately disappeared from his subsequent films. William Munny was a more perfect avenger for women in his award winning film "Unforgiven". In Gran Torino Walt Kowalski is the paradigm of avengers.</fullReview>

Everyone instantly recognizes him, but, despite their obvious fear, they see him as the one man who can save the town from the three gunmen due to arrive any day, now. He begins his retribution by raping a woman and killing several men who try to ambush him. And it doesn't stop there: by the time the three desperados arrive, he's effectively set the stage for the three to rape and murder as they see fit. Which they DO. In the end, of course, he exacts his revenge against the trio as well (they bull-whipped him to death while the town watched). The movie ends as it began, with Eastwood riding off into the shimmering heat waves. It's an effective little ghost story and was unusual at the time for being one of the few weird westerns to have hit the big screen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A menacing and mysterious western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>High Plains Drifter was Clint Eastwood's first western as director and it shows that he had absorbed a lot from Sergio Leone, who he worked under to make the Dollars Trilogy in the 60's. It's an American film that resembles an Italian western in many ways. Its plot is typical enough - a mysterious stranger arrives in a joyless settlement called Lago, populated by immoral, cowardly folks and ends up working as a mercenary for them in thwarting a gang of outlaws whose arrival is imminent. It's quite an unoriginal plot to be honest but it's the details that surround it that make it quite unique.There is an unmistakable mystic aura about it, with the stranger entering the film out of a strange mist and ending the film in a similar way. While it remains fairly oblique, it's certainly very prominently suggested that his character is some kind of avenging angel from beyond the grave and that he may be some form of incarnation of a marshal who was murdered in the same town some time ago. This incident is alluded to by dream-like flashbacks where it is made abundantly clear that the townspeople were as much to blame for the killing as the outlaws who executed it. Consequently, the stranger is not only hell bent on revenge against these hoodlums but he also wants to teach this town a harsh lesson too. In this way, while he ultimately defends them, he puts them through some traumas in doing so. Because the townspeople he is to save are so morally bankrupt, this changes the dynamic significantly and the movie has much less clearly defined morals. Eastwood directed a very similar themed western in the 80's, Pale Rider, which dispensed with these troubling conundrums and made it more of a clear case of good against evil; High Plains Drifter is the more interesting film precisely because it did not do this. Eastwood himself has more or less made an acting career out of playing dark heroes but his character here has to be the most extreme of all his anti-heroes, after all he not only kills with little concern but he also rapes a woman to put her in her place. This is a very questionable scene to be perfectly honest and very troubling.It's a very stylised film too, which really adds a fair bit. The final fiery showdown in the town that has been painted red and renamed 'Hell' is particularly memorable, while reinforcing the supernatural aura. The town itself is practically a character too. It's a settlement so small we can feel the whole of it. Its unusual lakeside setting additionally adds a strange atypical feel. The flashback scene of the whipping is nightmarish with an ominous soundtrack, similarly when Eastwood unexpectedly exits Lago it is accompanied by an unusual insistent, probing guitar riff than disorientates the viewer somewhat. It sums up the film in some respects in that, despite a very standard story line on the surface, there is something very strange and mysterious about High Plains Drifter. Its ambiguity and mysteriousness are strange for a western but for these reasons it remains extremely interesting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Moral Ambigities of the Old West</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Clint Eastwood is often since as one of the greats of the Western genre, both as an actor and as a director. His first Western as a director was the very dark, morally bleak High Plains Drifter.Eastwood stars as a mysterious stranger who comes to the small desert town of Lago. He makes his presence known by killing three men and raping a woman. The Stranger is hired by the townspeople to lead the defence against three newly released prisoners who want revenge against the town. But The Stranger's presence leads to conflict within the town as he is given carte blanche to do whatever he wants as the townspeople have their own dark secret.High Plains Drifter is a dark, violent film set in amoral world. There are few likable characters as violence is a way of life and there are moral dilemmas are presented in the film, such as the hiring of a man who rapes, the town's willingness to frame three power hungry thugs that were hired by the mining company and the town's witnessing of the death of the old sheriff and not doing anything to help him. The whipped scene reminded me of the story the murder of Kitty Genovese who was murdered and no one in her apartment block helped her despite her screams: and it turned out that the writer was heavily influenced by that cast.High Plains Drifter does have a supernatural edge to it, being more ambiguous about the main character, his actions and his motives. There is an eerie quality throughout, particularly from the music which uses a synthetic music. This is a film that is very open to interpretation, particularly the ending.Eastwood does have some ambitious shots for the top, using hand-held cameras to great effect to follow the actions, including during the assault on the town and a quick moment of seeing some shooting in the first person.High Plains Drifter is one a more artistic effort from Eastwood, showing a world of moral greys, being revisionist to the Western genre. It is a film that is a ghost story as it is a Western film and can easily please the fans of Eastwood's work.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>According to legend, it was a few simple edits that changed Eastwood's 1973 Western from a relatively conventional story of revenge in the near-lawless American West of the 19th century into something far more strange and far more effective.Eastwood plays the drifter of the title, a menacing anti-hero who emerges from nowhere and settles into a small town with a dark secret, first troubling and then intimidating the local townsfolk. It eventually becomes clear that Eastwood is no stranger to the town or its secret and the story eventually takes a supernatural, although never explicitly so, twist. One of the great Westerns from a period that seemed to be dotted with them (Once Upon a Time in the West, A Fistful of Dollars) and one that blurs genres to great effect.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A strange and interesting western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have over 20 Clint Eastwood movies in my library and this is definitely his most mysterious.The plot and subplots have all been well explained by other reviewers so I won't go there. It is somewhat dated now and the Strangers attitude towards women are a little archaic but are integral to the story and his desire for revenge.Plot and subplots aside, the main focus for me is on deciding who or what the Stranger is. In my opinion, he is not the dead Marshall's brother because he knows to much about his death but wasn't present. So that leaves us with the concept of a supernatural figure, either an avenging angel or the ghost of the Marshall but reincarnate in a form that is not recognisable.It is my opinion he is the ghost of the dead Marshall, forced to live in purgatory until he extracts revenge on the people who murdered him and allowed him to be murdered, and did not have the decency to provide him with a gravestone. There is a line in the movie spoken by Sarah Belding to the effect that 'they say the dead don't rest without a marker of some kind'. And of course the Marshall's grave is indeed unmarked. We also suspect that Sarah might know who the Stranger is and why he is there and this could be a reason as to why she leaves the town.So the Stranger consigns the townsfolk and his killers to a very real version of hell while rectifying the issue of his own headstone which will allow him to finally rest in peace. At the end, as the Stranger leaves, he sees Mordecai the dwarf chiselling the name of the dead Marshall on the gravestone. Mordecai repeats an earlier line 'what did you say your name was ?'. The Stranger nods to the marker and replies 'you already know'.Well that is my interpretation which works for me but the neat thing about this movie is that the identity of the Stranger is an open question which different audiences might interpret as they choose.It is also a darn good shoot-em-up western as well filmed in a surreal setting.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is indeed Clint Eastwood's signature western, it's a true antihero western. At first I didn't know what this movie was going to be about, a lone gunslinger comes to town and causes a bit of ruckus. But it doesn't get to the meat of the story until a while into the movie, close to 30 minutes into it. In this Clint is basically a bad guy but he still has few morals although not much. But to some degree he is still a likable character. And this time he is more mysterious than he ever has in a western. The whole movie builds up for the main climax and a twist near the end is done alright. Whats really good about this film is how it doesn't reveal entirely what is going on until the very end. Just when you seem to have gotten everything down there is more to it, in a good way. I also enjoyed watching the message behind this western movie. Overall it isn't one of the best western film I have ever seen but it's still pretty darn good.7.6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yes, this is a good film, but I'm not a real big fan of the theme and story. Eastwood's film tells the story of a lawman done wrong by the town that hired him to protect them. The opening sequence gives the audience the clues they need to figure out who a newly arrived stranger is.The film is a parable on courage, and sacrificing or deferring that courage to someone else whom you hope will do the job that you can't. Take that a step further. What if the person in whom you invested your faith and security needs your help? What if you fail that person in their time of need?That's the theme of film. Revenge verse justice. Honor verse basefulness. Which wins out, and who deserves what is the story the film tells. How much are men willing to sacrifice to get someone to help them save themselves? It's a fairly brutal and honest look at the savagery and cowardice to which men, as a group, will stoop.Shot around Mono Lake, some distance north of where I live, it was interesting to see a well known vacationing spot turned into a location for a big western, complete with shoot outs. The shots are respectable and well set up. They aren't overly artistic, nor merely functional, but are in line with classic Hollywood film making. The score is a fusion of traditional gun-fighter western music, flavored with a hint of horror to underline the larger revelation that is the film's story itself.Me, I like the film for what it is, and not always so. When I first saw it I took exception to Eastwood's character and his antics. With perhaps a less impassioned framework I can see the film's message, but even so I still have qualms with the extent of the Drifter's actions. But that's just me.If you like westerns, but are a little tired of the traditional fair created prior to the 1970s, then give "High Plains Drifter" a whirl on the DVD player. Warning, this is not a western to watch with children.An interesting film. Take it for what it's worth.</fullReview>

The story, which takes a while to come together, is pretty decent once you get it.There are certainly plenty of complaints you could raise. The rape aspect is completely unjustified. John Wayne criticized the film's violence and ultimately never worked with Eastwood because of it. The plot is not as clear as it could be. But I think as much as these may be marks against the film, there are not strong enough to take away from the film's legacy.I will be the first to admit I am not a huge fan of westerns, and aside from a handful just do not really get into them.

		<shortDescription>The Greatest Revenge Story Ever Told</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's room to argue about whether or not High Plains Drifter is Clint Eastwood's best western. (or film for that matter) My agreement usually depends on what day of the week I'm asked. I will however say that in my opinion this is definitely his greatest stateside western, though I'm sure some people still might disagree.There's certainly the highest amount of revenge ever visited in a film. The first and foremost is that of the outlaws who killed Eastwood (or his brother) and the second more interesting revenge against the town that he humiliates, desecrates, and pretty much destroys in the films fiery, violent climax.Reportedly inspired by the Italian film Django Il Bastardo. This takes the earlier film's exciting premise and wrings out all the story potential and ends up creating a better movie, though the other film is definitely worth checking out.A real standout supporting player is little person Billy Curtis. He really makes the best out of his role as the town's laughing stock whom Eastwood makes mayor and who has a ball watching the whole place taken apart. Interestingly, he got to be the hero and got the girl in the 1935 poverty-row novelty western The Terror Of Tiny Town.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a good film, memorable "post-Western" Western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Play Misty For Me, Eastwood's first feature film as director, pleasantly surprised many critics by avoiding important genre clichés (the obsessed murderess is not a wholly unsympathetic character, for instance), especially those expected from Clint "Dirty Harry" Eastwood. High Plains Drifter, his second feature, received respect but not open admiration, since it was after all another Western starring the original "Man With No Name" actor as, well, a man with no name. That's too bad, because the film holds up remarkably well and its graces should have been noted on first release.In fact, Eastwood uses this film to develop important technical chops. What struck me, seeing this film again after a few years, right at the beginning, was the use of sound. The rhythm of the horse's hooves, the crack of the whip, the lighting of a cigar, all are technically perfect recordings, brilliantly timed, and used to create an aura of significance.The film is a Western, to be sure, but approached as a Gothic romance. Italy's Spaghetti Western directors had been moving in such a direction for years, but of course, being European, their sense of the Gothic is somewhat different than ours, and their sense of the American West derived from watching motion pictures. This film is both authentically "Western" and authentically "American Gothic" as well, right down to its implicit Puritan morality.Eastwood is hampered by having on board as cinematographer Bruce Surtees. Surtees started out with Don Segal and it took him several films before he mastered the art of the wide screen lens - his images, in his early work, always look a little flat and more like TV than cinema. That's a pity, because this film cries out for a depth of vision he can't bring to it.There are weaknesses in the script as well; Tidyman was a solid genre screenwriter, but Eastwood recognizes a richness in the story that Tidyman himself misses. For instance, the parallel relationships Eastwood's drifter affects with the two women in the film could have been far more telling and dramatic. Eastwood tries to get the actresses to produce what the script hasn't given them, and he almost succeeds.So it's a good film, a memorable film, but it could have been a great film. As it is, and coming out in 1973, at the very end of the Western genre (and its European Spaghetti equivalent), it is among the first "post-Western" Westerns - largely ironic, somewhat surrealistic, but tightly controlled by one of America's most interesting directors of his era.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"High Plains Drifter" is one of Eastwood's best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Reprising his "Man With No Name" persona in this film (which he also directed), Clint Eastwood took the standard Western revenge story to new levels. In "Drifter", Eastwood is "The Stranger" who wanders into the small mining town of Lago to merely have a few drinks and a quick shave and bath. Before too long, he's killed three bad guys and raped the town tramp. The three dead men had been hired by the town to protect the residents from three more rotten fellows heading their way. It soon becomes apparent to viewers that the town is totally corrupt and that they're hiding some very devious prior actions. After first declining their offer, Eastwood's "Stranger" reluctantly agrees to defend the town against their three "enemies." But the Stranger has a lot of unique ideas on how the townsfolk should prepare themselves for the onslaught and he begins to humiliate and debase them to the nth degree. Of course they richly deserve what's coming to them since they were all complicit in the killing of the former marshal. Seems he discovered that Lago's main mine was actually situated on government property and he was determined to inform the authorities. The greedy and rotten citizens of Lago made sure that he never got the opportunity to do that. Although in the film it's never stated overtly that the Stranger is actually the ghost of the marshal, it's not too difficult to surmise from the audience's standpoint. When all is said and done, "High Plains Drifter" is a somewhat mean-spirited movie with few likable characters---but that may be why it's so much fun to watch. There are plenty of not-so-famous people in the film. Old-time western actor Walter Barnes has a field day chewing up the scenery as the cowardly and portly sheriff. Mitchell Ryan is around as the utterly corrupt boss of Lago's mining facilities. Verna Bloom does a credible job playing the only woman in Lago with any sense of decency. Geoffrey Lewis (as Stacy Bridges) does his best to make his character about as worthless and rotten as a human being can possibly be. "High Plains Drifter" is grim, unconventional, revisionist, and without one iota of anything remotely connected to Political Correctness. On that basis alone, it deserves the highest rating.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>High Pains Grifter</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dee Barton's ominous score heralds an angel of death materializing from the high desert haze: Clint Eastwood rides from the blasted plains into the sun-soaked seaside town of Lago, as townsfolk stare through the sandy heat at him atop his dusty horse, clopping steely-eyed down the main street. The Stranger from Leone's spaghettis ? reincarnated to rewrite the American West.Within ten minutes, this Stranger has had a beer, gunned down three misfits and raped a woman. Super cool. Super cruel.High Plains Drifter (written by Ernest Tidyman and Dean Riesner) has been called deconstructionist; formulaic, a dark study of the soul and a simple western? Exactly what this movie is, only history can judge ? one thing is certain: High Plains Drifter is a scorching classic: Clint Eastwood's first true American "avenger" film, re-writing the book on the quintessential cowboy; no longer the singing fop or the John Wayne do-gooder; the cowboy was now a sociopath, a recluse, an "anti" hero.The second directorial effort by Eastwood (after Play Misty For Me, 1971) is a revolution in film-making. We may well say "they just don't make 'em like that anymore" but the fact is: they didn't even make 'em like that back then! Note all the departures from Gene Autry/John Wayne convention: The Stranger is the Cowboy Star of this show, yet his horse is not white, but a dirty mottled appaloosa; he is unshaven, with a dusty longcoat (and he doesn't get any cleaner), he speaks without unclenching his teeth, like he holds all and sundry in utmost contempt (which he does), he doesn't wait for the "bad guys" to draw first (he'll shoot 'em in the back, or in the dark, or without warning ? as long as he kills them); even his hat was not the usual "cowboy hat" with upturned sides, but flat-brimmed; and since when do "heroes" rape? The Stranger oozed "bad guy," which is what he would have been in previous movies of this genre. Yet The Stranger is The Hero.Or is he?Though this movie is about a twisted kind of redemption, The Stranger didn't even have the mandatory "character arc" that defines every movie about redemption; instead, everyone around The Stranger arced, while he stayed the laconic, stone-hearted, anti-authoritarian maverick. This may be how the term "anti-hero" got coined: since it is taken for granted that every hero should have a defining arc and since The Stranger didn't, maybe he was not the hero of the movie, even though we invested our emotions and aspirations in that character. Not that anyone else was the hero. Maybe this movie didn't really have a hero! Who made the rules that every movie should? Hence: "anti" hero. (Almost every Eastwood movie featuring a character like The Stranger would boast the same absence of Hero Arc, from then to now.) The Stranger displays such calculated cool in gunning down the misfits that the town sheriff (Walter Barnes, channeling Skipper from Gilligan's Island) begs him to become the town protector against three outlaws who held a vendetta against the town and were on their way to Lago for revenge. In return for his promised protection, The Stranger manipulates the townsfolk into granting him free reign of the town and its resources, then proceeds to twist their panties with his insouciance and raw decisions ? tearing down people's barns to make picnic tables, making the town midget the mayor and sheriff; giving over supplies to Native Americans for free, eventually forcing the townsfolk to paint all their buildings red and rename the town "Hell" ? and we realize that The Stranger himself is exacting some kind of revenge on the townsfolk.In the town's dark past, these duplicitous, distrusting townsfolk stood by and watched as their Marshal, Jim Duncan (Clint's actual stand-in, Buddy van Horn), was whipped to death by the three outlaws. Was it coincidence that The Stranger breezed into town at exactly the moment that the outlaws would return? By movie's end? NONE of these questions are answered! The cast and crew of this movie would become Clint's long-standing film team: Bruce Surtees (DP), Henry Bumstead (Art Director), James Fargo (assistant director), with a cavalcade of familiar character actors: Dan Vadis, John Quade, William O'Connell, Geoffrey Lewis, Anthony James? Mordecai: "What did you say your name was again?" The Stranger: "I didn't." In unbidden irony, before we can speculate on whether The Stranger is Marshal Jim Duncan's brother, or an avenging spirit, or Jim Duncan himself, he has faded like a wraith back into the high plains haze from whence he came?.as The Man With No Name character is made more solid in American Western culture than Leone could ever have imagined.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Atypical genre dish</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wow, this film certainly defies categorization. It is most certainly a Western, but unlike any I have seen before or since. Among the most unique takes on the genre I've ever seen.This is a revenge opus extraordinaire, in the vein of Odysseus or Hamlet in it's deliberation. And like Hamlet, there is a supernatural theme here, albeit one that does not just appear in the beginning but develops into a crescendo over the course of the movie.Clint Eastwood stars as a mysterious drifter that wanders into a town, seemingly no different than any other stranger that might pass through. BEGIN SPOILER: This is no ordinary stranger, but a revenant, one returned from the grave to work his vengeance upon those who had wronged him in life. Of course, the townspeople don't know this, and all save one never really come to that realization. The stranger is not only identical to the marshall that the townspeople idly watched being murdered by vicious desperadoes, but is one in the same. It is perhaps a message by the director of the tendency for people to distance themselves from others and to avoid getting involved, especially in times of great peril. Is it not then ironic that no one even recognizes the man that was once the law in their town? One among many oddities is that the avenging angel, if you will, is quite solid and looks like any other living, breathing human being. END SPOILER Another unusual aspect of High Plains Drifter, especially for a Western, is that no character in the film is very likable - all have their character flaws and there is no one to truly root for. Few of them are really despicable, but none are really great. Any looking for "realism" in film should scream in exuberance for this one, then, since it's a pretty accurate summation of human character - most of us are flawed in some way, with only a few that are really bad.As for the movie itself, there aren't many flaws to speak of. It is certainly unusual and unlike any other Western, but that's good. Most of the characters were almost over the top cowardly, but that was a central theme to the film and certainly made sense. Few are willing to risk their necks if there's a better alternative. And the protagonist had few redeeming qualities, even when we finally understand the rationale behind his cold and deceitful behavior.In the end, High Plains Drifter was an unorthodox, odd sort of film that rubbed me the right way. I don't believe it will ever grow tiresome.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I read a response to this movie that I couldn't believe. Someone didn't like this film. Someone didn't understand the plot. They couldn't follow the scenes and couldn't make sense of the actions of the characters in this excellent movie.This is a fantastic classic western. You have "the stranger" (Clint Eastwood) returning from the past to right was has been wronged. Stacey Bridges (Geoffrey Lewis) is the lead outlaw and is outstanding as he and his gang show no remorse for the townsfolk that turned on them so long ago. You have the cowardly and lazy Sheriff as well and well done by Walter Barnes.This movie is a thinker too. You and the other characters in the film only realize who "the stranger" is towards the end when you find out his reasoning for returning after all this time. This is a great western full of gunfighters, barbers, boot makers, bartenders, lose women, action and suspense.I only gave this film a seven out of a possible ten. The special effects and stunts are a bit dated by today's standards. However the film is excellent and if remade today by a director like, oh let's say Clint Eastwood. I could see it earning a nine or maybe even a ten!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Clint Eastwood--Heir Apparent to Sergio Leone</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's evident in this film anyway. He has the Leone close-ups, the long silences, the dark, brutal stories, the nameless stranger. The only difference between them is Clint doesn't take as long to say what he wants to say.Clint reprises his man with no name roll in this his first western film as a director. WARNING! MAJOR SPOILER AHEAD. He is not a ghost. The marshal who was whipped to death doesn't even look like him. In fact, he's played by long time Clint Eastwood associate Buddy van Horn, who directed DEAD POOL and worked with Eastwood in a number of other movies, namely the EVERY WHICH WAY...ANY WHICH WAY movies. My beef about this movie is that if they wanted to give the audience the impression that Clint Eastwood was the ghost of this dead sheriff, they shouldn't have gotten such clear shots of his (Van Horn's) face. His face should have been hidden in shadow, by the gathering crowd, or maybe the camera should have shot him from a distance. But this is a good, intriguing story, and you still wonder just who this stranger is. An avenging angel possibly? Who knows? He sure knew how to mete out perfect justice, not only to the gunmen who whipped the marshal to death, but also to the town itself for showing such despicable cowardice. Leone's influence is obvious in this movie, and he taught Clint very well. 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dark western transcends its plot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is like a dark reflection of some of Eastwood's earlier Westerns. I hadn't meant to watch it but was soon caught by the dark, complex atmosphere with its suggestion of the supernatural. The plot if summarized briefly would differ little from Shane or the Magnificent Seven (or even Cat Ballou!), but the devil, as they say, is in the details.There is also, surprisingly, plenty of black humour here. While much of it depends on sight gags, there is also much subtle satire of Western clichés not excluding Eastwood's own performances. Some of the in-jokes are summarized in the trivia. The opening and closing scenes of a lone rider on a vast plain, shot with long telephoto so he hardly seems to move against the heat-shimmering foreground, is reminiscent of the famous scene in Lawrence of Arabia.The characters are almost all "bad and ugly", including the anti-hero Stranger himself. However there is enough sense of appropriate retribution and redemption to keep the movie from descending into the merely negative and bizarre.The chief danger of a movie directed by the star is self-indulgence. That was my first impression, and my initial rating reflected this; but on reflection I think Eastwood fully intended the irony of the classic poster-like Eastwoodian frames, and I raised it to an 8. I am not an Eastwood fan as such, but I believe he has made a fine contribution to the canon. Well worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A strange but watchable film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first saw this film I was rather confused. It is a film that can only be truly appreciated when seen at least twice. The storyline is complex and gripping although it can verge on the convoluted at times. An interesting thing to note is the distinct lack of music throughout the film. While many westerns use the ubiquitous twang of electric guitars to heighten the tension of the scene "High Plains Drifter" succeeds in doing this through clever use of camera and ambient sound. For example in the final showdown between The Stranger and his foes there is no music at all. The atmosphere is created by the light from the flames and the crackling of the burning timber. The one thing that annoyed me about the film is the ambiguity surrounding Clint Eastwood's character. While this adds to the dramatic effect I personally found it annoying that so little is revealed about him.All in all a great film with some slight idiosyncrasies but with enough drama to make it enjoyable, if a little difficult to understand.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A western on a different plain</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a really interesting western directed by and featuring Clint Eastwood. There are elements of this film that echo back to the famous Leone/Eastwood collaboration of the sixties but this is a vastly unique and different film and should be considered in an independent light. There are similarities - He is again the nameless stranger with a character similar to that played in the Dollars westerns and his dialogue is threatening yet highly amusing.However there is a supernatural quality about this film, the score is brilliantly haunting and the desolate setting - the mining town of Lago - seems almost ghostly. Eastwood delivers a fine performance as perhaps the most controversial of anti-heros featured in a western and he dominates the film from start to finish.The great thing about this film is that it's not what it seems. It might not jump out at you at first but this western has something extra. You'll just have to watch it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Eastwood Western, or a Westwood Eastern?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is an unusual take on Old West themes of violence, revenge, morality and religion. It starts out straightforward enough, but it gradually develops into a sort of surreal fantasy. Everything just gets more and more twisted. By the end, you're not sure if you've seen a Western, or a dabble into Eastern philosophy and mysticism.Great atmosphere, mysterious flashback scenes of bullwhipping, and the occasional stick of dynamite keep you riveted to your seat. Dry-humor wisecracks from a younger (and never better-looking) Clint Eastwood keep you entertained throughout. "Into the Badlands" (1991) with Bruce Dern is a great companion movie to see along with this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Superb Eastwood performance, and direction, in a somewhat twisted style. Eastwood performs wonderfully in this Western with a darker edge. With his usual stares and lack of emotion or speech he controls the scenes with small movements and looks, conveying more than some actors can do with an entire speech. This dark and somewhat disturbing tale of unstoppable revenge is filmed extremely well and draws you into the story without full understanding. Slowly, through flashbacks and intimations, the truth comes out, some things only appearing through the viewer's own assumptions. Sympathies are thrown from side to side, and at some times without anyone deserving anything more than contempt and hatred. This is a film that pulls many emotions from the audience, taking them on a none too clear path, with even the final conclusions being hinted at and leaving the audience somewhat unclear. A brilliant movie, and a showpiece of the Eastwood career.</fullReview>

SPOILERS!! Right to the point,Eastwood returns as a man who was killed by the town folk,yes killed.Naturally he wants vengeance and rightfully so.Suprisingly though,I've been shocked by the number of viewers who did'nt realize Eastwood was a ghost,and now I'm even hearing that Eastwood's original intentions were that this nameless character was the dead marshall's brother?!?!? Well,,believe me,unless you have a 3rd minds eye or are psychic,there's no way you would ever come to the conclusion that this was The Marshall's brother. If your interested in seeing one of THE most original westerns EVER,,,,check out this film.This could easily qualify as a fourth installment in the Spagetti classics,plus after viewing,you will probably be surprised that no one tried to copy this formula of success,probably a first in the industry. This film easily stands on it's own,but I would advise seeing the dollars trilogy first,then this,then round it off with Unforgiven.Overall,this film rates a solid 9 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A small town is set upon by a single "drifter." The drifter is Clint Eastwood (no name). It turns out that he was the Marshall of this town who was bull-wiped to death while the town just stood by and watched. Now Clint is back to rid the town of the miscreants who plague them.You might think that this is small town, but there are elements which sometimes give the movie a surrealistic effect. E.g. the name of the town is "Lago" (lake) but Eastwood renames the town to "HELL" and the point hits home when he has the town's people repaint their buildings. It's for the "party" at the end.Basically it has overtones of being a western "The Seventh Seal" and Clint is leading them all along for the ride. The movie is extremely tight - even to the very last scene.Although I only gave this movie a vote of '8' I very highly recommend it as quintessential Eastwood. It is so good and even though it is now 30 years old (made 1972, it's now 2002) I've seen it more times than I can remember. See it again and again - and if you're a film student... *STUDY* it!- Zafoid</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Eastwood sets the West on fire!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Clint Eastwood's first self-directed Western is one of his most memorable, effective and arguably darkest outing in the genre. Eastwood takes the familiar role of a tough, silent, nameless stranger who rides into a cowardly Mining town only to quite literally make all hell break loose for the local community when they ask them to help defend themselves against three feared gunmen. High Plains Drifter is electrifying from its iconic opening where Eastwood's stranger appears on the horizon like a ghost to its nightmarish climax. The film isn't quite as interesting when Eastwood isn't on screen and some details of the plot might as well have been non-existent. Generally, however, this is a perfectly-paced story with a strong dose of tension, suspense and symbolism and is only more powerful and noteworthy on a second viewing. Despite being a box-office hit, the film wasn't well received by critics in its day, perhaps for its unconventional and dark overtones, but was undoubtedly a breath of fresh air for the genre and is now recognised (along with Eastwood's follow-up The Outlaw Josey Wales) as a superior 1970's Western.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A while back, I took a break from movies, mainly because all of the recent ones stunk up the theaters like a newly run over skunk. Five movies and a month later, I saw HIGH PLAINS DRIFTER and enjoyed movies once again. I was so impressed, that it was the first movie I bought since BRAVE HEART was released on home video. Now that I can write a review for HIGH PLAINS without sounding like a blurbmeister, here it is in a nut shell.A drifter strolls into the remote western town of Lago. No one likes him, and the feeling is not only mutual but shown in the first several minutes. That does not stop the town for asking help from this stranger once they know that three outlaws are out of jail and probably targeting Lago.Acting and story are perfect in HIGH PLAINS. It is hard to look at another movie without comparing the acting to HIGH PLAINS. Clint Eastwood is very much at the top of his game. The movie suffers from simplicity. Like SOYLENT GREEN, you know the 'surprise ending' far before any of the characters do. But it does not stop HIGH PLAINS DRIFTER from being one of the most compelling and one of the most easy movies to get into. Two thumbs up.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The anti-High Noon or Kitty Genovese in the Old West...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As vicious as a rattlesnake with a case of hemmoroids, I've always described "High Plains Drifter" as "Eastwood at his scariest". Reflecting upon what kind of an animal it is, two things come to mind. First, this film could almost be called a photo negative version of "High Noon" (the fact that John Wayne hated both films helps this assertion). In both, a fundamentally good man goes against the "enlightened" voice of the town. But in High Noon, this was to protect them. Here, it's to punish them...and the Marshall pays a far higher price than Will Kane ever did for that defiance. In both, the protagonist takes on a gang of outlaws alone. But in High Noon, Kane is trying to get their help, help that they can most certainly provide, and they refuse. Here, everyone is all too willing to help out...until they see the price the Stranger expects in return. Will Kane faces the gang down in spite of the blatant cowardice on display. The Stranger leaves them to the gang's tender mercies and then strikes. The contrast is, to say the least, very striking.Second, the brutal murder of the Marshall brings to mind a real-life incident that Ernest Tidyman may have had in mind when he wrote the script: the death of Kitty Genovese. One fateful night, she was attacked not once, but twice, within the same two hour period, crying out for help that never came. Nearly thirty of her neighbors in the apartment building where she lived (and near where she died) just watched...doing nothing. Not that I think Tidyman was advocating quite what Eastwood enacted on the town for such a crime, but the thrust is simple: we all have responsibilities to each other we can't duck. When we try, it comes back to haunt us.Is this a good film? I would have to say yes, but be warned: "High Plains Drifter" is an exercise in brutality. Have a firm stomach and a strong set of nerves ready before watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Clint Eastwood's Darkest Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>High Plains Drifter(1972) is Clint Eastwood's tribute to the Speghetti Westerns of Sergio Leone. In fact this film can be seen as an American Speghetti Western. High Plains Drifter is a Western-Noir because most of the cast of characters(even the hero) is not a clear cut hero. Clint Eastwood gives a good performance balancing between hero and villain. This was done as a homage to his mentor Sergio Leone who played a important role in his directorial career.This film is better than Unforgiven(1992) because the main character is a man of a more vengeful and brutal nature. This is of Eastwood's early masterpieces as director. One of the best scenes is when he has the whole town painted red and renames it hell. Clint Eastwood would play a ghost again in Pale Rider but without the same viciousness he displays in High Plains Drifter(1972). This will be known to movie buffs as the film where Clint Eastwood rapes someone.</fullReview>

There are of course the cliche sights as he rides into Lago; the storekeeper who looks up with fear in his eyes, the barber filled with apprehension, the gunslingers standing outside the saloon and of course the undertaker making a coffin. I can only think of one other opening of such excellence and that begins the masterpiece Shane.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>High Noon, with a similar tale of villains released from prison hell bent to shoot up a town, did it much better.Clint has done better things with Dirty Harry, The Outlaw Josie Wales and The Unforgiven where he plays the same Eastwood avenging character.The film had some good one-liners and moody photography especially towards the end when the town was burning.The music conveyed a sense of impending menace but the town of Lago really did look like an artificial film-set.Not one of the best Westerns but I've seen it several times now and have not fallen asleep - which is indeed a recommendation!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>High Plains Drifter is the best Western I have seen ever. Basically, Clint plays an anonymous, enigmatic cowboy who seeks revenge on all those who caused his demise (which is shown in flashback and through very shrewdly placed dialogue)in a small town called Lago. It is obvious that he is some of reincarnation of the town's former sheriff. The most likeable of the town folk is Morcedai, a diminutive barber shop helper. The one liners in the movie are very smart. What I found interesting was Clint's way with women. If it airs on the late show, I highly recommend it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best "Clint film", but not the best film that Clint is in</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Perhaps some explanation is required here. Drifter is indeed the best Clint film, because it is the finest example of a film that could be fairly described as being a "Clint film". Clint directs and stars through a plot that concentrates almost entirely on him. The "acts" in which he is not the main focus of attention could be counted on only two fingers (if memory serves). Other examples of "Clint films" include "Dirty Harry", "The Outlaw Josey Wales", "Pale Rider", "Honkytonk Man", "The Unforgiven", "Every Which Way But Loose" et al. The indisputably finest film that Clint is in must be "The Good, The Bad and The Ugly" wherein Clint had to share the credit with the infallible Lee Van Cleef, an inspired performance from Eli Wallach and of course the renowned directing by Sergio Leonne.Featuring one of the most moody and atmospheric openings in any film (a feat made all the more commendable considering that it was filmed in broad daylight) and managing to convey instantly The Stranger's dislike of the town. For an excellent example of perfect timing you need look no further than the first five lines of dialogue, where it is quite clear who has the upper hand and who is running scared (while standing still). This is Clint at his very best. Comparable only with Sabata in ability, The Stranger goes on to display his Herculean talents time and time again in the ill fated Lago as he razes it to the ground.As he goes about his systematic destruction of the town, The Stranger displays again and again, with an acerbic wit, his hatred of all things Lago: a sneer here, a toss of the match there. Perfect. Funny in a very clever way yet still able to maintain its integrity as it conveys this jaundiced view of the old west. We see the town's residents being portrayed as a group of deceitful and cowardly egotists. The Preacher is a hypocrite, the Sheriff a coward, Lewis Belding is a traitor, his wife an open adulterer and the barman is just plain stupid. The only member of the town who we like is Mordecai and that is simply because his diminutive stature has left him out of favour among the other residents, which perhaps leads him to see this stranger in a different light (he lights Clint's cigars from the very beginning even after he has witnessed the rape).Meanwhile, as this picture is being built up we also see Clint acting in a less than saintly fashion. He himself is depicted as being a drinking womaniser (though the women supposedly come round to enjoying the time he spends with them). And why does he hate the residents so much? They had him killed because he refused to back down after discovering that their mine was on Government land. Fair enough. Turning them into the Government for that would have ruined them though, and he should have understood the danger that he was in. And what of the men who had killed him, and had then been arrested under false pretences, something that he didn't seem to approve of? Well sure enough, they had been arrested for something that they didn't do, but they were bad cookies, so what was the quibble. Sure enough, what Lago did to him was not right, but he must have been pretty stupid to let himself get killed over such a thing. I can imagine it now, the classic "I'm telling on you" scene, immediately followed by the "Oh no you wont" scene.These minor flaws aside, the picture includes a great wealth of varied characters, and very interesting events. Though the film has a slow feel to it, with Clint's slow drawl, a surprising amount happens. Almost everyone in the town is made to appear like a real person, and this creates a good feel for this unfortunate town stuck in the middle of the desert. As the plot develops we really do become curious as to what exactly will happen if and when Marshall Duncan's killers return. This itself is handled quite well, though it is not the films strongest point. The best bits are where Clint lets himself roam free to just "be Clint".An excellent movie and possibly one of the funniest westerns out there, while not sacrificing anything as a serious film in it's own right. It does upset me though when people watch this film and fail to see the humour because it is too subtle for them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Highly influential tale of revenge</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Probably the most controversial film on Clint Eastwood's resume, so much that even John Wayne said he would never do a film with the man after viewing this.Provocative film that centers around a mysterious stranger that rides into town one day, and turns out to be the ghost of the town's sheriff that the town folk had killed. He ends up seeking revenge on them as well as the gang that whipped him death.The movie is very dark and moody like film noir, and the haunting music score will run chills up and down your spine. It's obvious that the "coming back from the dead to get revenge on the gang that killed you" theme in the film also inspired later movies such as "RoboCop", "Dark Man" and even "The Crow".Overall, a dark decent into mankind's soul that will keep you thinking for hours after the movie had ended</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You are now entering Hell. Have a nice day.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Clint Eastwood follows up his directorial debut, the memorable 1971 shocker "Play Misty for Me", with this intense, flagrantly un-P.C., stylish film. A grim yet riveting Western with a touch of the (possible) supernatural, it stars Clint as an unnamed person who rides into the seaside mining town of Lago. The folks there fear the return of three former residents, who are now vengeance minded outlaws. Despite the rather nasty actions of the stranger, the townsfolk decide that he's their best bet to protect them from the wrath of these outlaws.The stranger makes himself at home, and takes advantage of the locals when they bend over backwards to make him happy. Eventually, he commands that they re-paint all the buildings red, and the place is re-christened Hell.Clint is at his low key best, displaying that effortless charisma in the role of a man who doesn't exactly go out of his way to endear himself to anybody (much less the audience). Yet he's hardly that out of place since the locals are - "Bad Day at Black Rock" style - complicit in some tragedy and barbarism in the past.The widescreen photography is beautiful, as is the stirring music score by Dee Barton. With the help of an excellent crew (also including art director Henry Bumstead), he creates a lot of impressive atmosphere. The viewers will also notice how absolutely brutal the action is, with a lot of gunshot violence and death by whipping.The cast is peppered with a lot of familiar faces and wonderful character actors. Verna Bloom has the most sympathetic female role as Sarah Belding, wife of the hotel owner (Ted Hartley). It's fun to recognize actors as they turn up: Mitchell Ryan, Jack Ging, Stefan Gierasch, Billy Curtis (who has an especially solid role), Geoffrey Lewis, Scott Walker, Walter Barnes, Paul Brinegar, Richard Bull, Robert Donner, John Hillerman, Anthony James, William O'Connell, John Quade, Dan Vadis, etc."High Plains Drifter" is unpleasant on occasion, but it's extremely well made and gives us a real gem of a finale, as characters confront one another amid burning buildings.Pretty damn good as far as Clints' efforts in this genre go.Eight out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I would call this an uneven film. At the beginning I thought I would be seeing one of the best of Eastwood's westerns, it really starts very well when he arrives in the town of Lago. There is a great shootout at the barbershop, also his confrontation with a hysterical Marianna Hill. The supernatural in the story adds a lot to it. The relationship of Eastwood with both Marianna Hill and Verna Bloom is unusual and some of the best moments of the film. In his effort to give a dark touch, I think Eastwood went too far specially in the action scenes which became a bit confusing. I would not say this film is not good, but it has such a great story and scenes, that it makes you expect more than it finally delivers. If Pale Rider was Eastwood's Shane inspired supernatural film, this one is the supernatural inspired by High Noon.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Chalk up another great movie for Clint Eastwood.High Plains Drifter is a very strange movie indeed. It is also a little confusing. In fact, it takes a while to fully get whats going on. But I think that is how its supposed to be.The music was really really well placed in the movie. Helped set the tone for a lot of scenes.Clint Eastwood steals the show as The Stranger, a mysterious man who rides into the scared, shady town of Lago and isn't long before he starts kicking everyone around. Geoffrey Lewis plays Stacey Bridges, one of the most cold-hearted bandits I've ever seen on screen. There are also great performances by Verna Bloom, Billy Curtis, Mitch Ryan, Ted Hartley, Jack Ging, Marianna Hill, Paul Brinegar, Robert Donner, and Walter Barnes.The movie is very cold and ruthless: just how a western based on revenge should be. There are many moving scenes. And there are also very comical ones. Eastwood himself is very comical and as always: you can't help but love his character.This is definitely a classic.9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>... and Hell followed with him.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This Clint Eastwood western is a lot of fun although not really suitable for younger viewers as there are some fairly violent scenes including a rape and a flash back which shows somebody being whipped to death.The film opens with a lone horseman coming out of the desert and entering the town of Lago. After a drink in the saloon he pops into the barbers for a shave where he is interrupted by three locals spoiling for a fight. Clint quickly dispatches them before they can get off a shot. It turns out that these three had been hired to protect the town from three murderers who had killed the town marshal, this crime the town covered up but to get rid of them they framed them for a robbery. They swore revenge on the town and are due to be released from prison the next day.The townspeople approach the nameless gunman, played by Clint, to help then protect the town, he isn't interested until they say he can have anything he wants if he helps. He soon takes advantage of the offer getting free items from just about every shop in town and making the local midget both the sheriff and the mayor. The more he takes the more the townsfolk start to argue amongst themselves, some even make the mistake of trying to kill him. By the time the three murders arrive the gunman has literally painted the town red and renamed it Hell.In many ways this is similar to his later film "Pale Rider", in both it is strongly suggested that the protagonist is an avenging ghost and he even rides a similarly coloured horse. The acting in the film is solid and includes many people who where regularly in Clint Eastwood's films of the time. As well as the action the film is memorable for the haunting music. This is one of my favourite westerns, I'd certainly recommend it to fans of the genre.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Clint Eastwood plays the "The Stranger" a man with no name who is sent to punish the people of a small mining town for their wickedness. The film is like an Old Testament version of High Noon. It's smart and one of my favorite films of the 1970s.The Stranger arrives in Lago on a pale horse and stops at the saloon for a drink. Three bored gunslingers try to provoke him into a fight, but he ignores them. Later, while sitting in a barbershop they make their move and he kills them. The Stranger is then insulted by a young woman (Marianna Hill) and he takes her off to a barn and rapes her. She seems to enjoy the experience. The townspeople have a problem. They conspired with three outlaws to kill Jim Duncan, the town marshal. The outlaws have been released from prison and blame their incarceration on Lago. The Stranger is hired to provide protection which he does at a price. The Stranger has regular flashbacks in which three men with large bull whips slowly kill a man in the streets of Lago. It becomes apparent that the victim is the dead marshal. Speculation on the identity of the Stranger is the main puzzle of the movie, he intuitively knows the town's history and treats everyone with contempt. This works because the people of the town are cowardly, corrupt and loathsome. By 1973, American Westerns, especially those starring John Wayne, had become tired, sentimental and predictable. High Plains Drifter was about crime and punishment and The Stranger was brutal and unpleasant. It was a different type of Western. Director, Eastwood used the West as backdrop for the action, but it could have been set in any time or place. The film has a quasi-religious aspect. In the Book of Revelation, Death rides a pale horse and Hell follows with him. This a great movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the most fascinating westerns ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Clint Eastwood is in my mind a great action star but an uneven director. In his career as a director, he has turned out two masterpieces, the later "Unforgiven" and this. Its a bit self-indulgent at times and not wholly original (just like most westerns of the time it seems inspired by "A Fistful of Dollars"). Plus, as a director Eastwood is not Sergio Leone. Still, this is one of the most fascinating westerns ever made. It touches upon themes not often openly acknowledged in westerns. The whole town of Lago is tired of being pushed around yet none of them ever have the courage to stand up to either their victimizers or their "savior" (Clint Eastwood). Eastwood's character is great because he's morally ambiguous and not all that clear cut. His actions are often reprehensible, but you start to root for him because hes the only character with any brains or courage. Some have complained about the open-ended depiction of Eastwood, but I think it adds to an almost surreal atmosphere. This is one of the darkest and most offbeat westerns ever made.Eastwood as usual is a great action star and this may be his most mysterious role. You never really know his motivations. The supporting cast is great all around, especially the great part for midget Billy Curtis. The film is quite unique also, with a strange dreamlike atmosphere and a possibly supernatural conclusion. Eastwood becomes an avenging angel whose only positive aspect is he kills people even worse than him. There are a few problematic things about the production (the view of rape will offend many modern audiences), but overall this is one of the best westerns from the time. (7/10)</fullReview>

In a turn of events this town is about to face a day of atonement and it all becomes clear when Eastwood paints the town red and calls it hell. High Plains Drifter is actually superior to Dirty Harry in some ways. For instance the pace is tighter, it's aged better and indeed features Eastwood at his most charismatic and mean spirited. The way people make a big deal about Million Dollar Baby, Unforgiven and Mystic River (Which are good) sadly neglect that this in my opinion will be Eastwood's Oscar for best director. This movie is poetic in its violence and the themes of justice and vengeance are given dimensions that far exceed most westerns. This is a must see and is the highest on my want list for DVD. Speaking of which this movie needs a special edition DVD, it's that special. So see it! * * * * out of 4-(Excellent)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Nothing really, at least in my opinion, matches an old Clint Eastwood western. You know what to expect; violent interludes, smart talking and of course, smart shooting. Well, it's back to basics here: Sombre, yet good guy Clint, is a drifter, who "happens" to stumble across a small little town in the west that, surprisingly, (for those times) knows very little about guns, or self defence. So, it's a blessing from God when gun-smart Eastwood comes in, teaches them how to defend, and in reward for his efforts, gets anything he wants on the house. But, cleverly, as well as helping them, he exposes them, for the nasty, brutish, greedy people they really are. In his mind (unkown to the rest) he's only there to kill off the three guys who bull whipped the "Marshal" to death all that time ago. Brilliant. That's the word that pretty much correctly describes this piece of cinema. It's brutal, ugly work, venturing further into the horrible times of the west- but it's a clever, groundbreaking piece of cinema nevertheless. **** out of **** (4 out of 4)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Eastwood's tribute to Sergio Leone</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I commented on the incredible "The Outlaw Josey Wales" (1976) while ago I was still having enormous troubles of deciding which one of Clint Eastwood's fabulous movies actually is the ultimate western of the 70's? Is "High plains drifter" (1972) better because I sometimes think so. Then again, I think of how unbelievably spectacular "The Outlaw Josey Wales" is and immediately change my mind. I love Eastwood and I love both of these amazing films as well as his other works and that creates quite a difficulty. When I have two practically flawless western masterpieces it's naturally extremely hard to name a better one. Truth is I had seen "The Outlaw Josey Wales" much more often. Nevertheless, recently I bought the Dvd of "High plains drifter" and after seeing the classic again I can say that I've finally made up my mind. It simply has to be better."High plains drifter" is much more classic Eastwood. Unlike in "The Outlaw Josey Wales", audience doesn't even know Clint's character's name. He's a good old cool and mysterious stranger: nobody knows where he came and where he's going. Everybody knew what Josey Wales was up to and why. It's easy to see dazzling "High plains drifter" as Eastwood's tribute to Sergio Leone because masterful Clint really shows all what he has learn in his legendary Dollars trilogy years. Witty and absurd story, extraordinary settings and marvelous acting makes "High plains drifter" a memorable classic. Once you've seen the hell-red town of Lago you can never forget it. See the breathtaking largen-than-life widescreen version and enjoy! This is truly the greatest western of the 70's. 10/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film, which I believe marked Clint Eastwood's directorial debut, also happens to be his finest work as a director (with the possible exception of the outstanding "Unforgiven"). The later remake as "Pale Rider" falls far short of this film, which is truly a cinematic masterpiece."High Plains Drifter" contains all the elements that any great film should: a thought-provoking central theme, a unique and consistent visual style, an intelligent script, great casting, and excellent performances by all the central characters.The choices made with the detachment of the set from the rest of the world, and the bleak, simplistic view of every element of this movie are inspired and serve to very effectively highlight the central theme of the film without losing the viewer in details.A note to anybody who watches this film without using their brain: The high-plains drifter is NOT just another super-powered gunslinger, he represents the physical incarnation of spiritual vengeance and karma. "High Plains Drifter" has only one message and delivers it relentlessly: Everybody is responsible for their actions (or inactions) and everyone will get their just desserts.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Movies and Mythology -- Eastwood believes.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Eastwood is a spirit returned from the dead. A former sheriff who was whipped to death by some rowdy cowboys returns to the scene of the crime and involves everyone in the town who could have helped him, but didn't, in a bizarre plan to welcome the bad boys back to town after coming out of prison. The avenging angel and the dwarf jester concept of mythology underlies the entire plot. Watching it unravel is the appeal of the film. A fine though little-known supporting cast. Billy Curtis outstanding as the dwarf.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A clever presentation of karmic laws!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am tremendously fascinated by this movie. The first time I saw it, it took a long time for me to appreciate that "The Stranger" was a transmetamorphic revenging spirit. The revenge was carried out according to the individual and collective karmic situations of the people of Lago. The spirit "parasitized," and subsequently abandoned at a crucial moment, those who passively watched as he(the marshall) was murdered. He manipulated his murderers to murder those who arranged for his murder. He directly killed the men who had killed him. After evening the score on these counts, he returned to the spiritual dimension. The term "karma" relates to the spiritual laws of cause and effect. "What goes around, comes around" is another way to expressing the karmic "law of balance." Our misfortunes are proportionate to the misfortunes we have caused others. There is also an illustration of the principle that "the first shall be last and the last shall be first" with the spirit's appointment of the town's major, and the benevolence he bestowed upon some of the local native Americans. There was also a recognition of the principle that just as wrong doing in its different forms can lead to misfortune and tragedy, altruistic action can be a source of reward. I appreciate this movie as a subtle spiritual masterpiece. I've gotten a little more out of it each time I've seen it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Black-Hearted and Vengeful, Clint's Later-Era Drifter is Tough to Watch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Clint Eastwood stars and directs in this shameless Leone homage from the early '70s. Eastwood's unnamed horse-mounted strangers have never been the friendliest characters in the west, but in this instance he takes things to a whole new level. He's quick with guns of several varieties, mowing down three rowdy bar patrons and raping a bystander in the film's uncomfortable opening scene, then settling in to take the surviving villagers for all they're worth when he's hired for protection. As it turns out, the village has a few dirty secrets of its own, and its leaders soon resort to a wide variety of veiled threats and bumbling backstabs to keep them quiet. That leaves absolutely no one in the clear as a moral compass, even the twisted preacher, and the film soon settles in to spinning lazy circles like a rudderless ship. Misogynistic, mean-spirited and narrow, it's not a whole lot of fun to watch beyond a few sporadic action shots and one or two well-placed puns. A far cry from the unspoken atmosphere, dense moral grey area and thick, palpable character of the Spaghetti Westerns that made Clint's name in the mid '60s.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quite possibly Clint Eastwood 's most badass movie , classic!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>High Plains Drifter is a dark and very unpc western classic directed and starring Clint Eastwood. Everyone has their favorite Eastwood western ( Unforgiven is my favorite ) , but you really can't go wrong with any of Clint 's westerns in my opinion as they are all great films and classics. Clint is a man with no name , but with supernatural overtones that are left to the viewer to interpret his origin. Within minutes of his arrival to town our un named antihero shoots down some thugs and rapes the town tramp . The town as corrupt and cowardly as they are offer to hire this stranger for his deadly skills as there are dangerous criminals getting out of prison looking for revenge on the town that betrayed them. Clint now has free reign of the town and he paints the town red, makes a midget sheriff and mayor and brings retribution. A traditional western this is not, but this was a great vehicle for Clint and one of my favorites. A decade later Clint made Pale Rider which is similar to this and excellent also.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Greatest of it's genre!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>High Plains Drifter is the zenith of it's genre. I don't know if anyone can aptly put into words the level of genius and perfection this movie has. I have watched HPD so many times that I know almost every line in the move - from ALL the characters. I think HPD is the single greatest violent western of all-time - better than even The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly. It is certainly my favorite western ever and the reasons are these; the setting (Mono Lake in California) is visually stunning with the town built just for the movie. The music is so eerie and foreboding - it's mesmerizing! The character development is simply outstanding. William O'Connell who played the Barber, and John Quade who played the Freight Wagon Operator are two of my favorite actors. The facial expressions that O'Connell makes and his ultra nervous mannerisms ( shaking like a leaf when attempting to shave Clint!) are simply brilliant, brilliant acting that cannot be matched. Mariana Hill who plays Callie Travers is excellent as the town floozie. Clint's side-kick Geoffrey Lewis is at his menacing best! Robert Donner the Preacher, is astounding. His line, "I'm just a simple man of God" is said with a lilt and depth that you have to hear. Everyone in this epic classic is amazing - everyone. The script is perfect in my opinion. The plot of the movie centers on Sheriff Jim Duncan who is bull-whipped to death after we learn he discovered the Lago Mine was on government property. The townsfolk, convinced he was going to reveal this to the authorities have the 3 hired thugs do this dirty deed. Only Verna Blooms character, Sarah Belding tries in vain to help Sheriff Duncan. The man who never reveals his name rides into town and in no short order he has raped the town floozie and dispatched 3 thugs who the town fathers hired to ward off the now jailed Stacy Bridges and Carlin Brothers - who murdered the Sheriff - disturbed him while trying to get a bath and shave. Mayhem ensues when Stacy &amp; the Carlin brothers return to Lago to seek revenge for being railroaded by the moral corrupt towns folk. A fascinating case study of right and wrong, morals and justice. I do not have enough superlatives to bestow upon this movie. I watch it at least 2 - 3 times a month. There is an element of psychology in the movie that relates to Clint's character and the dearly departed Sheriff. Is he the Sheriffs brother or is he the Sheriff reincarnated? This is up to each viewer to make their own decision . This movie is 10/10 perfection. See it. Buy it. Love it. Forever.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Where death is the reward for the cowardly?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Vengeance is mine, says Clint Eastwood in this story of retribution set beside a pristine lake somewhere in the old West (actually shot at Mono Lake, California). Here's the pitch: the marshal at the town of Lago is brutally whipped to death by three bad guys while the town's people watch and do nothing to help. The bad guys wind up in jail for a spell, but on the eve of their release, The Stranger (steely-eyed Clint Eastwood) turns up at Lago to have a killer of a town party and paint the town red, literally and figuratively.What follows is a succession of confrontations by the townsfolk with The Stranger who summarily dispatches, sometimes with extreme prejudice, any and all who get in the way of his job: which, quite simply, is to wreak vengeance upon the three miscreants when they return to Lago, and this time, with the enforced help of the cowardly residents.The opening sequence has the The Stranger descending through the heat haze and from the sierra across the undulating plain to the lake shore and Lago, obviously a nod to the opener for Shane (1952); after the dirty deeds are done, director Eastwood pays homage to Shane again, as The Stranger disappears into the heat haze and sierra once again, never to return. Using inter-cuts and recursivity, Eastwood effectively weaves the back-story of the marshal's murder with the unfolding carnage. The finale, while technically interesting ? being mostly at night ? does not have the force of a story like Shane, for example, and certainly not Sergio Leone's Once Upon a Time in The West (1968), arguably the best attempt to date to show vengeance and retribution.Eastwood gives his usual stolid performance as a Man With No Name. But most everyone else overacts, of course, the exceptions being a delectable and aloof Verna Bloom ? and the horses. Well, this is a fantasy after all, even at the most banal level, so anything goes. For the curious, the epilogue clearly discloses the identity of The Stranger, so I'll leave that morsel for you to discover when you see this movie, which is mainly for Eastwood fans. I wouldn't rank this film in a list of all-time great Westerns, however.The most striking feature is the natural setting, startling in its beauty and an excellent contrast to the dirty little brown town full of dirty little people, the last perhaps being the reason the story fails, ultimately, to deliver any truly worthwhile message: we all know death comes as the end, but none of us would want to identify with any character in that Hell of a town, and certainly not with The Stranger on a pale horse.Maybe that's why, after also doing another story about vengeance with The Outlaw Josey Wales (1976), Eastwood went on to produce and direct Pale Rider (1985), an unashamed remake of the Shane story, in yet another attempt to get it right? In my opinion, though, not until Unforgiven (1992) did he truly succeed with a story that rivals Shane, and perhaps even trumps it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gothic/Supernatural Western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>On his second film both in front of and behind the camera, following the success of PLAY MISTY FOR ME in 1971, Clint Eastwood decided more or less to resurrect the mysterious Man With No Name persona of the spaghetti westerns he made in the 1960s with director Sergio Leone that made him an international star. But in HIGH PLAINS DRIFTER, that persona is taken to a whole other level. The end result turned out to be one of the most commercially and artistically successful westerns of the 1970s, and further cemented Eastwood's reputation as a diverse individual both in the acting and directing departments.Eastwood plays the mysterious title character, who rides out of the desert into the town of Lago, situated on Mono Lake at the eastern foot of California's Sierra Nevada. The townsfolk, naturally enough, are deeply suspicious of this guy and his motives, particularly when he begins to take over the town step by step and set neighbor against neighbor. But they have a reason to be suspicious, because they're harboring a dark secret. Only one year before, the town marshal was killed by a trio of outlaws (Geoofrey Lewis; Anthony James; Dan Vadis) hired by the town's mining company in an attempt to keep the marshal silent over operations being done on land that actually belonged to the federal government. The townspeople did virtually nothing to stop it; if anything, they were complicit in the killing.But when word gets out that the outlaws are to be released from jail, intent on taking violent revenge on Lago, the town hires Eastwood as their "protector", giving him free reign. Of course, as Eastwood is quick to learn, when it comes down to it, everyone in town is scared by these outlaws, a fact that becomes obvious when, after he has ordered the town painted red and renamed Hell, they let Lewis and his friends all but destroy Lago. But in the end, Eastwood has a surprise for all concerned...including the audience.Although sometimes thought of as a parody of the Man With No Name films, HIGH PLAINS DRIFTER is more of a Gothic and even supernatural extension of that persona, heightened by elements of black humor, particularly involving the town midget (Billy Curtis) who is basically an outcast of the piece. Much of the supernatural element of the film can be found in the flashbacks to the marshal's murder, in which the connection between Eastwood's character and the marshal is chillingly ambiguous, particularly in the next-to-last shot of the film. Eastwood, as always, is great on both sides of the camera; and his cast includes well-known character actors like Mitchell Ryan, Stefan Gierasch, Robert Donner, John Hillerman, Richard Bull, and Jack Ging. Lewis, who would appear in several more Eastwood films, makes for a thoroughly nasty villain as well.Wisely filmed entirely on location at Mono Lake (the town of Lago was built from scratch, with the buildings fully developed to allow for both interior and exterior shooting), HIGH PLAINS DRIFTER benefits mightily from Bruce Surtees' incredible cinematography and Dee Barton's haunting music score. It is one of the most mysterious films of its genre, and, despite a few objectionable scenes (including a fairly nasty rape), it is among the best, and a prime example of Eastwood's abilities.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrible film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>High Plains Drifter is such a pretentious and badly crafted film that it begs the question of what Eastwood was thinking when making it. Any moments of interest in the film are crushed by the rest of the film which is overlong, dull and, generally, pointless. Eastwood simply retreads his old role of a nameless gunslinger. In his other film (usually under the wing of Sergio Leone) it comes across very well. Not so here. The craftsmanship of the film also seems to draw criticism. It looks nothing like a real town and is obviously a Hollywood set constructed for the film. I would rate this * 1/2 out of ****.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Eastwood had obviously picked up a thing or two from Sergio Leone, and it shows in this bleak, violent, and absurd Western. But whereas Leone's 'Man with No Name' was a likable purveyor of death and vengeance, Eastwood's 'The Stranger' is so menacing and cruel that he's rendered completely unsympathetic from the get go. While I enjoyed some of the film's more surreal moments (painting the town red and the apocalyptic finale), Eastwood goes too far in trying not to take his character seriously and turns him into a nearly cartoonish comic book figure. When he tosses the dynamite into the hotel room and then guns everybody down, about the only thing missing was a 'Yippee-ki-yay, motherf*cker' or 'I'll be back' type quip.I'm sure there are those who prefer action over art and gritty realism over style, but I'll take 'A Fistful of Dollars' over 'High Plains Drifter' any day.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A satisfying western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The most controversial scene in this movie concerns the taking by Clint Eastwood of a "lady" and now referred to by many posters as a rape. These people should first of all consider the context, i.e. the "wild west" in the 19th century. This was not an epoch or location noted for gentility and good manners. Indeed, such attributes would have been ridiculed in a rough mining town such as this. Anyone being raised here would be influenced from a young age by ongoing situations and the general mores of the town. Let's not mince words here, this girl was a slut. Her initial approach to Clint was notable for its lack of finesse, but this girl knew no other way to approach a man. She had learnt from observation that this was the way to achieve her ends. This same approach, in a more modified form can even be seen today in some quarters. Rape? I don't think so. Her dubious character was accurately drawn. There is a strong and ironic comedic overtone to this movie and is very welcome considering some of the violence depicted. Never have so many craven cowards been assembled in one place. Of course, the movie is dated, but now takes its place as a classic of the genre. A great watch if you are in the mood for a simple plot which is brimming over with malice and satisfying revenge themes. Thank goodness Clint didn't ride off into the sunset followed by the departing unsatisfied wife who had simultaneously loaded up her buggy as Clint left town. That would have been unforgivably corny. On another note I thought the buildings in the outdoor set were unconvincing in some respects. The timber was too smooth and modern looking. Also the windows were obviously plate glass (not invented) and too sparklingly. clean considering the dusty street. And modern building materials could be seen, especially round the backs of the set.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Clint Eastwood's best hell pulse-pounding climax classic western masterpiece!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Disclaimer: If you are a viewer that mainly prefers art-house-type movies, then you might as well ignore this review. In addition, if you're not able to take a Clint Eastwood's best pulse-pounding western masterpiece film, ignore this review, as well. We'll both be better off.High Plains Drifter (1973) is in my opinion Clint Eastwood's best pulse-pounding climax classic western masterpiece! It is my fourth favorite Eastwood western film flick and it is in my top 5 Eastwood western films! I love this movie and it is a tone horror dark western movie. Which is the film that I really believe, is a classic Clint Eastwood's best western! This is Clint Eastwood's second film as a director finds the celebrated action star returning to his familiar Old West stomping grounds and his internationally acclaimed role of "The Man With No Name." This time, The Stranger (Eastwood) mysteriously appears out of the heat waves of the desert and rides into the lawless, sin-ridden town of Lago. After making a name for himself with a string of blazing gun battles, The Stranger is hired by the townspeople to provide protection from three ruthless gunmen just out of jail. The Stranger quickly proceeds to paint the entire town bright red, rename it "Hell," and supply divine retribution in the fiery, pulse-pounding climax of this acclaimed western shoot-em-up.Plot: A drifter with no name (Clint Eastwood) wanders into a small town, where his gun-slinging abilities are in high demand. When the drifter rides into Lago, he is met with incredulity and disapproval by the townspeople. But once he shows his skills with a pistol, the locals realize he may be able to help them fend off a band of criminals who have been terrorizing the town. He agrees to help the townspeople, but does so with his own secret agenda."You're going to look pretty silly with that knife sticking out of your ass." - Best Clint Eastwood's dialogue lines in the film. I like that this film has a good plot, it is mysterious and scary all the time. The three villainies Geoffrey Lewis, Dan Vadis, Anthony James are scary killers in this film, that no one can touches them, and they kill everything that moves. I love how this film is portrayed and that Eastwood is a mysterious stranger on a revenge against the corrupt, selfishness and greed in the town Lago. The movie is evolving about a murder of marshal Jim Duncan (Buddy Van Horn) who was murdered in the town of Lago from three outlaws and the towns people covered up. Clint Eatswood is probably which I assume Jim Duncan's brother that get's revenge on everyone. I have never seen in any movie the town been painted red and written Hell never. Buddy Van Horn been whipped to death by three outlaws. This film is gruesome, bloody and very violent with a gore and tons of shoot-em-up scenes. It is different than For a Few Dollars More but is still pretty good western flick.Like is said I think for a western flick that Clint Eastwood directed is probably his best western movie he directed. I love this movie to death I love it and it is my third Eastwood favorite western film! After he has killed the three men the locals ask if he will stick around and save them from three convicts who are being released after the town got them to commit a rather heinous crime. Seen in flashback scenes the crime is the brutal murder by whipping of a town Marshall. The problem in the film is actually the rape scene, which is tough to watch and the score is a little dated now. The good is not afraid to try something different and raises more questions than it answers. Engaging story, great performances and plenty of violence/action. You have even one explosion in it, the town is burning up in flames and the mysterious man kills all three outlaws on the same way that they killed Jim Duncan. It's not exactly feel good fare like I said and darker than you'd maybe expect but It's not without a sense of humor and Eastwood expertly directs it, keeping it well paced and relatively short at an hour and 45 minutes long.Overall: I seriously love this film to death! High Plains Drifter is a daring and quite different film with Eastwood not playing a hero type! This film get's a solid 10 by me which everyone of the cast did a solid performance cause I saw the acting been realistic and there are no CGI in this film! High Plains Drifter is a 1973 American supernatural western film produced by Robert Daley for Malpaso Company and Universal Studios, directed by and starring Clint Eastwood, and written by Ernest Tidyman (who also wrote the novelization).10/10 Grade: Bad Ass Seal Of Approval Studio: The Malpaso Company, Universal Studios Starring: Clint Eastwood, Verna Bloom, Mariana Hill, Billy Curtis, Mitchell Ryan, Buddy Van Horn, Jack Ging, Stefan Gierasch, Ted Hartley, Geoffrey Lewis, Dan Vadis, Anthony James, John Hillerman Director: Clint Eastwood Producer: Robert Daley Screenplay: Ernest Tidyman Rated: R Running Time: 1 Hr. 45 Mins.

		<shortDescription>A bizarre western that takes many risks</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Following the success of Sergio Leone's masterful 'Dollars' trilogy was surely a daunting prospect. This makes the fact that Clint Eastwood not only starred in, but directed a western with apparent gratitude to Leone and his distinctive style all the more exciting. I consider the 'Dollars' trilogy to be not only among the best westerns and trilogies of all time, but of the best films of all time, particularly the second and third instalments. It was because of this admiration that I approached High Plains Drifter with a certain ambivalence. I am well aware of Eastwood's supreme talent as a director; Play Misty for Me, however humorously dated, is still stunning, and Unforgiven was a uniquely understated yet grimly powerful film, and there are numerous other examples of his greatness, too many to state here. Yet I was surprised that I believed that, upon reflection, Eastwood did not only follow those succession of films admirably, and crucially, originally, but with one that I consider to be better than A Fistful of Dollars.High Plains Drifter carries a pervasive mystical tone, that is at first strangely disorientating, but gradually, settles into a near-perfect explanation, or excuse, for a revenge western. Throughout the film there is much typical Man with No Name-style bloodletting, the barber's scene being the most obvious example, but it is not this that interests me. It is instead the great risks Eastwood takes, not only in the film's characters and narrative, but with his own image and reputation. Due to his roles in television westerns such as Rawhide, Eastwood was in reality, a minor star. The 'Dollars' trilogy secured his lasting reputation in westerns as a strong, quiet, yet brutal and funny loner. High Plains Drifter dispenses with nearly all humour from Eastwood's character who, not coincidentally, has no name. Instead the idiosyncratic townsfolk of Lago provide much of the humour, including the almost fantastical character of the dwarf Mordecai. Also, perhaps most significantly, is the almost unbearable callousness of Eastwood's character; throughout High Plains Drifter Eastwood rapes two women, and casually dismisses them, with the second falling for him unrealistically. This is the most surprising aspect of the film; that an actor this handsome, would decide to mould himself into an image so despicable as a director. I find this impressive, because it shows Eastwood's resilience as an actor, and that he is unafraid to muddy his image.Also the film is notably more experimental in tone than the spaghetti westerns and traditional American westerns that came before; there is a dream sequence and instead of the Ennio Morricone-esque scores that were inevitably going to be imitated, High Plains Drifter utilises an innovative score comprising ghostly choirs to illustrate the main crux of the film's plot.Eastwood's character is, essentially, a wraith, who has come back to avenge the murder of federal marshal Jim Duncan, who was whipped to death by outlaws. He also resembles the marshal. His character is an angel of death figure, and much hellish imagery is used to heighten this; for instance when he is whipping the outlaws at the climax of the film, he stands illuminated by the fire surrounding him, almost resembling Satan, punishing the outlaws for their actions. In fact the entire climax of the film, despite narrative discrepancies, (where could that amount of red paint be sourced from, if timber was so hard to come by that they had to tear apart barns that were already standing to build tables?) is incredibly visceral in this regard. While the ending leaves little open for interpretation, it is the perfect conclusion to a very unique film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Rewatched it just now, excellent, cathartic, funny, ultra-violent, eerie sort of black comedy western starring Clint Eastwood as a nameless avenging angel who brings some cleansing to a town of corrupt and fearful people who each carry a share of guilt and shame after they allow a marshal to be tortured to death at the hands of bandits. The soundtrack by Dee Barton is very eerie and shrill, often composed of wild animal-like howling that compliments the primal violence. The film is funniest when Clint Eastwood offhandedly rapes a woman without a second thought and takes over the town as if it were his right. The kindly smile he wears as he implies sexual assault to the wife of the hotel owner is priceless. You can tell Eastwood had fun making this film and also starring in it. The pyrotechnics and action are spectacular, especially the finale. Refreshingly simple and fun film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When a mysterious stranger(Clint Eastwood)rides into the sleepy town of Lago, his presence is met with extreme anxiety by the townsfolk. However, upon finding that sadistic outlaw Stacey Bridges and his two cousins have been released from prison, the townspeople decide to appease the stranger in the hope he will protect them from the three gunmen. The stranger agrees before setting himself up as a king amongst the townsfolk, who are unaware of the dark surprise he has in store for them. The townspeople soon find themselves turning against one another and tensions reach boiling point after some of their number try to kill the stranger. Meanwhile the three outlaws are fast approaching Lago, but why does the stranger bear an eerie resemblance to the town's sheriff whom they brutally whipped to death in the town's street a year previous...Clint Eastwood's second foray into directing(after the chilling Play Misty For Me), High Plains Drifter is a ghoulishly symbolic nightmare with pinches of extramundane mysticism. Despite being gorgeously existential, the movie is an ode to the Dollars trilogy and it is evident that Clint drew a lot on his association with Sergio Leone, which is why I define High Plains Drifter as a pseudo-spaghetti western. Clint was awesome as the nameless stranger, playing the part with the awe-striking, cool-headed professionalism that he crafted so masterfully as the Man With No Name. Unlike most (American) westerns, High Plains Drifter has no heroes, just villains. Let me begin by saying that the film is beautifully metaphoric in it's depiction of guilt. It is a study of the our "dark side" as individuals and the conscience that terrifies us so when we do something wrong, the voice in our heads that keeps us awake at night warning us that someday, we'll get what we deserve. Even those of us who claim to fear nothing at least fear their own conscience and this is cleverly represented in the movie. The stranger is this immortal being whose unyielding objective is to punish the people of Lago(and the three outlaws)for their wrongdoing. It transpires that the locals hired the trio of killers to viciously whip the stranger(formally the sheriff of Lago, Jim Duncan)to death a year before after he found that their mine was on government property. Anyway, on the surface the stranger symbolises the severe guilt felt by the townsfolk for condoning this heinous act. The three outlaws are also symbols of this burden carried by the locals as they went to prison for committing out the murder and thus are seeking violent retribution on the people upon their release. The stranger's arrival in the town highlights the sins of the townsfolk returning to haunt them, as does the outlaw's climatic attack on Lago. On the other hand, the townsfolk symbolise the evil of ordinary people who may appear righteous but deep down, are repulsively corrupt. This is an evil that indeed doesn't go unnoticed and will be dealt with, as is the case in the film. Many will make of the film's symbolism differently, but that's just my ten pence worth. High Plains Drifter featured top notch performances all round. Verna Bloom and Marianna Hill were both fantastic, as was Geoffrey Lewis as the savage Bridges. Jack Ging also gave a furiously engaging performance.Thanks to the intelligent script, High Plains Drifter has a dazzling aroma of deliciously morbid humour about it. I always like to see piercing cynicism displayed in a movie and this film has plenty of it. The cinematography was stunning with the shots of the town and surrounding lake glistening in the sun. The shots of the towering stranger standing against the backdrop of the burning town near the end of the movie added a hellish atmosphere to the film's already macabre surroundings and the psychedelic musical score intensified the surrealism.High Plains Drifter is like a revenge themed spaghetti western, albeit with disquieting imagery and grisly absurdism thrown in. Ironically, it conveys an ultimately compelling moral message. 9/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I attended film school at the University of Southern California in the mid-1990s, I took an advanced course called 'Terminal Cinema.' I can remember how this film, HIGH PLAINS DRIFTER, was the focus during one of the weeks of the semester/syllabus. I did not always agree with the professor's take on things, because some of what he said was pretty far out there. But his interpretation was that Eastwood was basically playing a Satanic character-- that the anti-Christ had been unleashed on the town, as evidenced by the various goings-on. The rape of the woman at the beginning is definitely an unholy act, so maybe the professor was on to something. Or else on something.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brutal Western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>High Plains Drifter begins in seemingly familiar territory for Eastwood in his second Directing venture, with a nameless man (Eastwood) riding into a small Western town. However, the film quickly changes pace with a disturbing rape scene and an equally disturbing flashback of the man being nearly beaten to death with bull whips. We then begin to see that this is a revenge film and that it is not going to pull any punches. The film is an inversion in some way of High Noon, but instead of the lone righteous Sheriff defending a town full of cowards, the Nameless Man comes to defend the town and also use it for his own devices. 7.5 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Man With No Name drifts into town</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>High Plains Drifter (1973) is one of the best Clint Eastwood westerns I've ever seen, right up there with Unforgiven (1992), Pale Rider (1985), The Outlaw Josey Wales (1976), and The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly (1966). Basically it's about a stranger who drifts into a dysfunctional Texas town and ends up........well, you'll have to watch to see how everything unfolds. I don't want to give anything away. The cinematography is great, the scenery is great, the camera angles are great, the music is great, and the acting is great. This movie has gained in stature over the last four decades and is now considered a classic Western. This movie has a little bit of a supernatural aspect to it with Clint Eastwood's Man With No Name character.High Plains Drifter comes highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Outstanding western with excellent an story telling quality</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This in my humble opinion is perhaps one of the all time best westerns that I have ever seen. The story is very solid and still makes perfect sense today. The characters motivations are very relate-able and make perfect sense. There is the right amount of story line, plot, character development and action for an almost seamless blend. There is enough comedy to balance out the violence and there is a great morale to the story as well.of negative reviews of this movie are from people who did not understand that it wasn't ever meant to be a realistic straight forward formulate western. It was meant to be a fun kind of parody on them and that is why the characters are stereotyped and over acting to make this humorous. I really can't think of a more enjoyable and entertaining combination of all of these particular elements in any other western. in any. I can't recommend this film highly enough.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Eastwood's Westerns Never Let You Down</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>He rides into town on his horse, and all the townspeople stop to stare at him. He tries to get a drink at a bar, but three yahoos just won't leave him alone (guess what happens to them). He treats women with utter contempt, but they throw themselves at his feet anyway. He doesn't say very much, won't give out his name... but is a gunfighter par excellence. Welcome to another Clint Eastwood Western.This one is a bit more elaborate than most though. Not only is he taking revenge on the outlaws who whipped him to within an inch of his life, (or possibly killed him, the film leaves that to your imagination) but also the population of a small town which just stood by and let it happen. The various indignities he subjects them to as a price for his help, like forcing all the guests out of a hotel so he can have it all to himself, and having the locals to daub their buildings in red paint while writing on the sign WELCOME TO HELL are hilarious.He smokes his cigars, is nice to Indians and Mexicans, and never looks flustered for one minute. It's impossible not to be drawn to this guy, despite his dubious moral compass. Eastwood directed the film too, and he seems to have learnt a few tricks from his mentor Sergio Leone... such as how to film a tense gunfight and good use of the long shot when necessary. He would go on to helm many more films, and it's obvious why when you see talent like this. Yep, I like it. 7/10</fullReview>

The townfolks hire him to create a militia to defend the town from three outlaws who are on their way. He's given free rein over the town, and starts making strange demands. As the town is forced to supply him at his whims, discontent spreads.Is he defending the town? Or is he tearing the town apart? Clint Eastwood is playing the anti-hero. His motives are muddy. He rapes a woman. He is a rough man. There's a dark secret that the townfolks are hiding about the previous sheriff. Does the man with no name have any relationship with that? It's an iconic role not only for Clint, but for American Cinema. His murky motivation is a sign of times in an era of discontent.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disturbing and often comic magic realist western-fable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A great, idiosyncratic Western for which Clint Eastwood is indebted to Sergio Leone's great trilogy. Many odd, solipsistic things occur during the film. The set is purpose built but has been left to look as such, as if the town had materialised overnight. The protagonist certainly does and the charismatic townsfolk only emerge in response to his arrival - there is none of the usual urban business in the background. Thus the film unfolds, in a deliberate, dogmatic fashion.Eastwood's terse stranger is virtually a moral blank slate (actually I suspect that an act of charity toward native Indians early in the film is designed to offset the asceticism of this character trait). Instead we are fed the backstory about the inevitable baddies to let us form our own parameters of right and wrong in this alien, godless town. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Clint Eastwood was Outstanding</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Clint Eastwood plays the role as a stranger who visits a small Western town and takes complete control of this town called Lago which has very cruel and evil people living their and Clint walks into big trouble. As you watch this film you will begin to realize why this particular stranger visits this town because of the horrible murder of a U S Marshall who is bull whipped to death. Clint Eastwood directed this film and created a very different Western which clearly showed how men and women in a small town can be so evil and become so self-centered. Clint added plenty of romantic scenes with women, and some could very well be considered rape in a horse stable and a hotel room. John Wayne did not care for Clint's change in this type of Western, but we all know that Eastwood made many new and different Westerns, namely: "Unforgiven".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worthwhile, but a dark experiment in film-making..........</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you are expecting anything other than a dark, downbeat film-making experiment from Clint in this one, you should forget those expectations and approach it from a different viewpoint, or at least an open mind. To me this movie is the screen equivalent of a Walter Sickert painting, which I realize is a hard-nosed critique, but not a bad connotation from a talent standpoint. Everyone agrees that Sickert was a great painter and his downbeat ugly paintings are interesting studies, but do you really want to look at them? Like Sickert, Clint is artistically first-rate here, but due to the style of the movie parts of it are ugly. As in Sickert paintings, Clint has deliberately avoided inclusion of anything positive, upbeat, or humorous here other than as a cruel joke or a smirk. Does Clint here display the work of a budding genius filmmaker, or is "High Plains Drifter" just a mean, ugly waste of time? You must decide for yourself.In my opinion this is a well-made film and a worthwhile addition to the enigmatic world of film experimentation. One saving grace in its overall concept is that the protagonist's motivation is apparently revenge-driven, rather than cruelty for cruelty's sake.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I first saw the film in England in 1993, while I was studying at the Actor's Studio, Ms Hill was my teacher. And of course, being a young and curious student I wanted to know by whom I was taught. So, I got the film, sat down with a Coke and some popcorn and watched it. After the the film was finished, I realized I hadn't even touched the popcorn and didn't drink anything from my Coke. I was just very much into the story. I asked myself, if it was because the next morning I would see Ms Hill again, seeing her in a different light? No. I had just seen a film really worth watching. And I was proud of my teacher, that she had participated in such a great movie. Excellent film! A must see for movie lovers and especially young filmmakers! Thrilling storyline with a fine twist at the end. Great visuals, and very well told. At times controversial and shocking, but let's be honest; what's film-making all about?! Impressingly great performance by Mariana Hill and Clint Eastwood. This film has absolute cult status and became one of my favorites!!</fullReview>

In High Plains Drifter, he is the nameless guy who rides into town one fine day. Clint clearly has issues in this movie. Repressed angst? The result of a traumatic childhood? Who knows. He's antisocial and can't stand the townspeople - a feeling that is emphatically returned. When push comes to shove there's a whole lotta shovin' and he finds himself training the other men for an upcoming assault by a group of revenge-seeking desperadoes. Is Clint Eastwood a ghost?

The fact that I am still bambuzzled is a compliment to the intent of the writers.Succinctly, upon my last viewing of this film, my opinions of the anti-hero alternated from being an angel of mercy, to the devil himself, or in the alternative, the simple mortal brother of the slain lawman.I believe this was the true aim of the writers to leave a giant question mark as to the identity of Clint Eastwood's character. Coupled with the erratic behavior and choices made by 'Stranger,' plus the weak and hypocritical nature of the townfolk, this film attains classic status.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not a big fan of westerns at all! But "High Plains Drifter" must be one of my personal favourite of all Eastwood movies. (I've seen them all except two: "Paint your wagon" &amp; "Le streghe".)I don't know if it's the overall badass attitude, the story, the characters or the cinematography that makes this film special but one thing is for sure, it's a true classic! I prefer this film to "Unforgiven" and "The Outlaw Josey Wales" by far.It's ambiguous, eerie, cliché, violent and politically incorrect. Even the music (and sometime the lack of music) is awesome, you won't find any banjos, dobros, harmonicas or fiddles gigue of any kind; almost an horror movie soundtrack if you will. In two words: Classic &amp; Badass!</fullReview>

Eastwood soon shoots them dead, scaring the townspeople, who decide to enlist his gunfighter skills to defend them from three former residents, who are being released from prison, and are out for revenge against Lago for a betrayal. Eastwood soon discovers that the town has many unpleasant secrets, and that he has some of his own...Eastwood imbues this western with a terrific spooky atmosphere, aided by an ethereal music score, and sure-footed direction. Good story and acting, memorable end. Only negative is that it is quite violent, though it is that brutal violence which is the impetus for the plot, so hard to get around. Mysterious film will leave the viewer haunted.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hell of a film...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Clint Eastwood's allegorical western is a genre classic. At the time of its release it was unlike any other western that had come before it. And it remains one of the best films ever made in that genre to this very day.The plot is simple and set in a gorgeously stark lakeside location. A stranger (Eastwood) passing through the mining town of Lago stops for refreshment and is almost immediately provoked into killing three hired guns. He is then accosted by the town bike and proceeds to rape her in a stable for her rudeness. Not your average travelling salesman then.The townsfolk of Lago were previously complicit in the murder of the town sheriff. He was killed by a trio of mining company employed hoods. They whipped him to death in the street. These three killers were then framed for theft by the townspeople and conveniently imprisoned. Bad news is they have just been released from the pen and are heading back to town with payback on their minds.The townsfolk, noting the stranger's prowess with a gun and his mercenary attitude to life in general, ask him to help defend them from the returning thugs. In return he can have anything he wants. And that's a big mistake. He agrees the deal and sets about teaching them a lesson they will never forget.The set-up is simple, but within this straightforward framework resides a complex and multi-layered allegorical fable about morality, sin, cowardice, greed, hell, revenge and redemption. This is not your typical horse opera, no sir.People who have seen the film are all, to some degree, hung up on the question of the stranger's identity. There are several possibilities and theories.He's the Devil. This is based on his almost supernatural ability to avoid certain death and the scene in which he refuses to help the townsfolk until they offer him anything he wants. The suggestion being that this is the key moment when they have willingly sold him their souls, and he is then free to take them to hell. One character points out: "This couldn't be any worse if the devil himself had ridden into Lago."He could be an avenging angel on a mission to teach the sinful populace of the town a lesson.Or, he is the restless spirit of Jim Duncan, the murdered sheriff, returning in another guise to take revenge against the town and the men who killed him. The stranger has dreams of Duncan's death. Some critics point to the closing scenes when Eastwood is leaving town and the midget Mordecai, who is putting a name on the sheriff's grave marker states: "I never did know your name..." to which the stranger replies: "Yes you do". As Eastwood rides away, the camera pans to the name of the sheriff on the grave marker.Perhaps he is really just a footloose traveller passing through who, by a twist of fate, gets caught up in events and everything else is just smoke and mirrors. "I was just riding through looking for a drink and a hot bath."The identity of the stranger doesn't really matter. It is never specified but the script provides plenty of clues and cues to generate speculation and it is therefore in the eye of the beholder. You pay your money, you take your choice. Deliberately left open to interpretation. Me, I like the Satan idea, and sometimes I think that's the most likely interpretation. Then I watch it again and I'm pretty much sold on the ghost of the dead sheriff idea. It varies.Whoever or whatever the stranger is, his actions are more significant ? he rides into Lago, he clearly has an agenda ? whether that is ultimately pre-defined or off the cuff. His mission is to mess with them, show them the error of their ways and orchestrate punishment. That's what he does and then he's gone. Like a ghost, melting into the heat haze as he rides into the distance in the closing scenes.How he rolls is, he makes the local midget the sheriff and the mayor. Takes serious advantage of the offer of anything he wants; has them paint the town red (Preacher: "You can't mean the church?" Stranger: "I mean especially the church."). He changes the name of the town from Lago to Hell. Then he deserts them to the mercies of the vengeful killers, later returning in a night of flame, whiplash, gunfire and reckoning to wipe out the bad guys; finally leaving Lago a chastened and ruined husk that either needs to be reconstructed or abandoned.Reasons why you should watch it? It's provocative, stimulating, intriguing and a fabulous example of the creative invention going on in American mainstream cinema in the early seventies. The violent action still has the power to shock even now and it is directed by Eastwood with the skill and flair of a major creative talent. He extends the western mythology re-envisioned by the likes of Leone and Peckinpah and elevates it to another level. The screenplay by Ernest (Shaft) Tidyman is blackly humorous, laconic and smart, littered with some classic Eastwood one-liners, and there is not a single dud performance from the very accomplished cast. Great atmospheric score from Dee Barton and haunting cinematography by Bruce Surtees. Even if you don't like westerns, watch it for the sheer thrill of being reminded why cinema is an art form.The creativity and quality on show is something you won't see replicated in Hollywood movies today. Amazing what could once be achieved back when no one had even imagined CGI could ever exist. And if they had and considered the implications, they wouldn't want it to.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Top Notch Eastwood Western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love Eastwood westerns. And this is definitely one of his bests. Many fans and even Eastwood himself have pointed at this story being a supernatural tale. About a dead man returning for some unfinished business. Whether that be the case or not, I simply view this as a vengeance tale of a man who wants payback from the men who killed him, and the town that let it happen.This was also the funniest and in ways darkest westerns starring Clint. Eastwood rapes women on two different occasions (although it should be noted that clues pointed to them being consensual.) The role of the dwarf Billy Curtis as the appointed sheriff was hilarious, as was the town in general. The aspect that makes this movie so great is the story's formula. You become so accustomed to Clint saving a town, you can't help but laugh.The town's sets were sort of a let down. They seemed like they were just that, sets. Made by carpenters a week before filming. Other than that it's hard to find anything wrong with this film.This is a notch below some of Clint Eastwood's more notable westerns, but is the best of his "second tier." Although it may only appeal to Eastwood fans, "Drifter" is a great movie that really makes you appreciate Westerns in general. I highly recommend you watch some of Clint's other westerns to truly appreciate "High Plains Drifter."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Bit Too Dark For My Liking</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As the movie begins, your mind is immediately drawn to the later Eastwood picture "Pale Rider": Eastwood's mysterious character appears in an Old West mining town that's terrorized by the thought of three returning outlaws, and they hire this stranger to be their protector. The similarities really end there, though. Eastwood's character in this is far less noble and selfless than his character in "Pale Rider." In fact, he isn't noble or selfless at all. He's motivated by a desire for revenge and nothing more. The three outlaws he agrees to take on viciously beat and - yes - murdered him in the town a few years back while the townsfolk looked on and did nothing to help him. So he has few kind thoughts for the residents of the town either.And, yes, I said that Eastwood's character had been murdered years before. A quasi-spiritual element gets added to this movie with that bit of knowledge that gets revealed slowly over the course of the film. Eastwood's character had been buried in an unmarked grave, and local legend had it that anyone buried in an unmarked grave won't rest. Duncan (the name of Eastwood's character in life) certainly wasn't resting. The whole thing led up to a decent enough confrontation at the end of the movie that leaves the outlaws dead and the town devastated and Duncan riding off into the wilderness, apparently having earned his rest.Eastwood did well with the role. It's the sort of role he could probably do in his sleep. The rest of the cast was solid - no one particularly outstanding, but no one who dragged the movie down either. It was an OK movie. I just found it a little too dark for my liking, lacking in any truly redeeming purpose. It did make me appreciate "Pale Rider" even more than I already did, though, with the very different take Eastwook put on that very similar character.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good idea that fell flat...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After having just watched this film, I'm frankly quite disappointed that this film has such a high rating on IMDb.I went into the movie with no expectations other than what I had read on the back of the DVD. I heard from several people that this was a decent western with a supernatural twist, and the idea really excited me. But the outcome was nothing of how I expected.While I've read the reviews that Eastwood's character was "cruel and menacing", I have to ask: Were we watching the same film? This "menacing" character gave native children candy, their father a dozen blankets, and befriends a little person. Sure, he kills a few guys in the first 5 minutes (how surprising for a Western), and he does rape a woman. However, you have to take into account that this woman quite obviously wanted the attention by causing the confrontation, and the scene in which she's taken to the office after attempting to kill him provides a good source that she's been around alittle. To be fair, none of the characters were likable, and the only character which had any real depth to them was the leading bad guy, who should've got much more screen time.You can tell that Clint Eastwood was (trying) to emulate Sergio Leone's superior style, but I found everything, from the characters to the atmosphere, just a cheap imitation of earlier better Westerns. "The Stranger" was a bad Western cliché who was nowhere near as iconic as Blondie.I'll give it to Eastwood - the idea of being a supernatural Western was cool, and the soundtrack was in all fairness fairly decent. It's an average film that deserves an average rating.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the first Westerns that took a revisionist stance as opposed to the traditional ones of the genre. Clint Eastwood plays here his favorite type of hero ? Unnamed stranger . Well , not quite unnamed ? the movie makes it kinda open who he is to give it a supernatural feel. The character of Marshal Duncan was played by stuntman Buddy Van Horn, a long-time stunt coordinator for Clint Eastwood, in order to create some ambiguity over whether he and The Stranger are one and the same.The movie itself is rather straightforward revenge movie. It's style over substance , but what style ! Clint Eastwood is the definition of word "charisma". He might not be the best actor in the world , but when he's on screen you can't take your eyes of him. "High plains drifter" shows us something we can't find in movies anymore ? a true manly man , a true star , a true icon. The movie is Eastwood's tour-de-force . He's simply bad ass. Every man fears him , every woman wants to be with him (even if she doesn't want to admit it).I liked Billy Curtis as Mordecai. The other actors are also OK. The direction by Eastwood is solid . It's the first time Clint Eastwood directed one of his Westerns. The scene with whips is actually disturbing and that's a good thing. There are some laughs and nice dialogues . As I said earlier it's a simple revenge movie. More violence than substance , but who said that's necessarily a bad thing ?I give it 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Strong Western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>High Plains Drifter (1973) *** (out of 4) A mysterious stranger (Clint Eastwood) comes to the small town of Lago where he's hired by the townspeople to help them kill three men about to be released from prison. At first the people think they've found a bargain but soon they start having second thoughts. This here is such a strange film that I can't help but wonder what Eastwood was exactly trying to do with it. Was it a homage to his earlier Spaghetti Westerns with Leone? Was it a spoof of the Western genre? Or was it a mixture of some sort of strange ghost story set in the West? I'm really not sure but it seems to try and mix all three to the point where this is just a downright surreal and at times rather frustrating film. I don't think it's bad film-making but in fact very good film-making because Eastwood never really lets on to what he's trying to do and that's where the film gets most of its power. I personally never saw this as a horror movie, although I know many fans claim that. To me the movie is simply about getting revenge against the so-called bad guys and the so-called good guys hiring the stranger. We even get a rather bizarre rape scene, which usually leads to quite a debate in what exactly it was going for. Was it saying women enjoy rape? Again, I'm not sure but this is a scene that's pretty ugly yet Eastwood follows it up with a hilarious scene of the woman seeking revenge while he's taking a bath. The strange mixture of seriousness, drama and then comedy makes for one strange film but the director and star does a fine job handling the subject even though I think the movie begins to lose some of its steam towards the end. Eastwood the actors turns in another fine performance because there aren't too many people who can say so much with such few lines of dialogue. Verna Bloom, Marianna Hill and Geoffrey Lewis all turn in fine supporting performances by it's midget Billy Curtis, who I had just watched in The Terror of Tiny Town, who steals the show with a wonderful performance as the other outsider in town.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a post-"Spaghetti Western" Clint Eastwood Western. Because it is not one of these earlier films, the music (one of the best aspects of the films) isn't nearly as good and Eastwood doesn't wear the duds he wore in his three "spaghetti" films (i.e., Westerns made in Italy). However, it's still a dandy film--however, it is VERY important to understand this is NOT a film for kids!!! Apart from all the extreme violence, the language is pretty raw and there is a rape scene early in the film. This rape is very problematic, too, as with heightened awareness of sexual abuse, the rape was not handled well in the film--showing an old fashioned "she wanted it" view of rape.The film begins with Eastwood coming into a very unfriendly town and killing three stupid thugs that try to pick a fight. The town is excited to see his skills with a gun and magnanimously ignore his raping a woman shortly after the shooting. While the lady was very nasty and I think Eastwood's character with no name might have been provoked enough to slap her,....he raped her!? The town's acceptance of this is just one of many indications that they are a town not worth saving. But, because they give Eastwood carte blanche to do ANYTHING he feels is necessary, he agrees to protect the citizens. Eastwood takes full advantage of this carte blanche and does him darnedest to upset the townsfolk--giving away liquor, making a malevolent midget the new sheriff AND mayor, and forcing the town to be painted red.Why all this occurs and the despicable way the townspeople have behaved and will behave are a treat to see. I don't really want to discuss the reasons further, as it would spoil the film. However, exactly WHO Eastwood was and WHAT his motivation is are left intentionally vague. At the end of the film, the midget (Billy Curtis) asks him who is is,...and Eastwood tells him "you know". Really?! I have some ideas, but this is far from a certainly. This left the film with a mystical and strange quality I actually liked. In many ways, it was an interesting and bizarre take on the films HIGH NOON and BAD DAY AT BLACK ROCK--two other films I strongly recommend.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>70's Western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A stupid 70's social film, with a mean anti hero as a lead character. This film is about revenge, it has rape, murder, and a hard edge to it. A little to hard for my taste, Eastwood literally paints the town red, and creates his own hell on earth. (you will get what I am saying if you saw this film) In the end we do not know if the character is from hell, or someone who knew about the events that happened. There is one really good scene in the barbershop with Eastwood, with the local gunfighters.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Next to "Hang 'Em High", Clint's worst Western **spoilers**</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay, let's get this outta the way: I think I've seen a minority of Clint's films, but, I think I'm able to make the above comment since I've seen all of his Westerns save "Pale Rider" (and "Ambush at Cimarron Pass", the film he claimed was the worst ever made). Clint's first Western as a director was a let-down, especially by the high standards set by Eastwood.Eastwood's Westerns are superb as a whole. The carefree, cigar-smoking, quick-drawling, quiet Man With No Name was the pinacle. While I like "Unforgiven" and "The Outlaw Josey Wales" better, those are Clint's claim to fame, and classics in their own right ("The Good, The Bad, and the Ugly" being the best of the three). Then he went to America and misfired with "Hang 'Em High" (which, according to what I heard, was to be directed by Leone, who turned it down). That film was more like a traditional John Wayne Western (and don't get me wrong, I love John Wayne), only waaaaaaaaaay too slow. Eastwood got into two shootouts and him walking calmly up to people and arresting them doesn't fit his character. "High Plains Drifter" would appear to, but it's nearly as bad.Not that it's bad outright. It's good, but again, given the body of Clint's work (not including his Universal cheapies like "Revenge of the Creature" and "Tarantula" [though I enjoyed both]), this is dissappointing.Clint is the mysterious stranger who rides all over the place and then ends up in a typical backwater (or backdesert, if you prefer) Western town. Three guys make fun of him, so he wipes 'em out. A woman harrangues him with insults, and she's - well, see the movie. So far, so good. But after awhile, it's kinda lame. The plot is unoriginal (kinda like a twisted version of "High Noon") (though that's not a bad thing in itself) and the ghost story wasn't all that interesting. Even Clint whipping the one baddie to death isn't really worth mentioning, and the end shootout is, since it's nighttime, next to impossible to follow.I think I'd take "High Plains Drifter" as a self-parody gone awry. That's what it appears to be. Again, it's enjoyable, but there are tons of Westerns (and not only Clint's) that are much better.Five stars.PS: In case you don't know (this isn't a spoiler to the film, since it's never revealed in it), Clint said that the Stranger is actually the dead Marshall's brother! Kinda takes away from the film, doesn't it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My first Clint Eastwood western...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>...and it might be my last. This film was supposedly "inspired" by the tragic murder of Kitty Genovese.A stranger (Clint Eastwood) wanders into the very small town of Lago. Within 15 minutes he's shot three men dead and raped a woman. The townspeople hire him to kill three men who have been released from jail and are coming to the town for revenge.I'm not a fan of Western movies so I'm probably not the best judge on how good this film is. I found it somewhat self-indulgent and a little slow. The violence isn't that graphic (compared to what we have today) but do we need to see a brutal, bloody and long whipping twice? DEFINITE PLOT SPOILERS!!!! The sexism in this in this is just unbelievable. He rapes a hooker (well played by Marianna Hill) and she LIKES it!!! He then seduces Verna Bloom which gives her the courage to leave her husband. It seems that Eastwood thinks he's so great in bed that women automatically love it and get strength from him. What saves this film from being totally worthless is the main plot--the townspeople of Lago stood around and watched while their sheriff was whipped to death. No one tried to help him. (I'm not giving anything away-it's shown at the beginning) So, the townspeople are guilty (in a way) of murder. A reason is given for it--but does that excuse what they did? Also Eastwood is a killer and a rapist. There's not one person in this film to root for. Only Billy Barty comes close. I could be seeing too much into this, but how can you enjoy a movie where all the characters are murderers? SPOILERS END!!!!It is well-directed by Eatwood--there's some really beautiful wide screen photography here. The acting is OK. Eastwood never moves a muscle in his face but the townspeople and the killers themselves are well done. I can't say I enjoyed this but I did find the psychological aspects of the plot very interesting. But it's very full of itself, was boring in parts and is pretty depressing. I can only give it a 6.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>High Plains Drifter</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From director (his second time) and actor Clint Eastwood comes another good man-with-no-name western. Basically a Stranger (Eastwood) arrives in the mining town of Lago to stay for the night. At first the people are all staring at him and seem not to like the look of him, he guns down three desperadoes. The town hire him (giving him anything he wants with no cost) to be the gunfighter to defend the town from three murderess outlaws, Stacey Bridges (Geoffrey Lewis), Bill Borders (Scott Walker) and Cole Carlin (Anthony James) who have been released from jail. The Stranger has personal "business" as he witnessed them brutally whip to death the town's local lawman Marshal Jim Duncan (Buddy Van Horn) who is in an unmarked grave. Anyway, the three outlaws are returning for vengeance, and The Stranger is getting the town ready, painting the entire village red, and the sign of Lago saying "Hell", as you'd expect gunslinging follows. Also starring Verna Bloom as Sarah Belding, Marianna Hill as Callie Travers, Mitchell Ryan as Dave Drake, Jack Ging as Morgan Allen, Stefan Gierasch as Mayor Jason Hobart, Ted Hartley as Lewis Belding and Billy Curtis as Mordecai. Eastwood as always is perfect with that voice, those eyes and attitude as the anonymous cowboy, and the gun fights as always are enough to keep you interested. Clint Eastwood was number 18 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, and he was number 61 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons. Very good!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Be Careful What You Wish For</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What`s that fable that tells us we should be careful what we wish for ? The Monkey`s Paw is it ? Well HIGH PLAINS DRIFTER is more or less the same tale set in a frontier town in the wild west . Callie Travers gets what she wishes for from the stranger and spends the rest of the story complaining about it as do most of the other characters in Lago . Gawd some people are never happy and the town`s folk in Lago don`t deserve to be seeing as they`re both cowards and greedy . Oh and they could have easily defended the town themselves against three outlaws without the help of the stranger , but I guess they`re the sort of people who always in need of someone else to fight their battles . I`m not entirely convinced if it`s the point the film is making but it does seem to have a slightly fascist subtext that might is always right , or at least Darwinism is . I can`t readily except what some other commentators have been saying about HIGH PLAINS DRIFTER being a supernatural film because Ernest Tidyman`s script strikes me as being ambigous rather than supernatural. It`s a very good script and Eastwood show`s us he can be a very good director when he tries , though some of the acting is painfully obvious when the characters are called upon to show fear. Mind you the characters are total cowards so I guess they show their fear by having a convulsive fit</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Would be better if Pale Rider wasn't so superior to it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Make no mistake, this and Pale Rider are the same movie. And make no mistake, both movies are about the spirit of a wrongly slain man returning for revenge. This was common knowledge when the movies came out, and only recently have people tried to distort the plots. Makes you wonder if some of the nuttier Eastwood fans actually think he'll return after he dies. We know the answer to that, don't we? This could have been a good story, but the high profile spaghetti influence has just been too powerful, sorry to say, ever since the early sixties. The bullies who want to make westerns unenjoyable really sank their teeth into the making of this one. The lead character has no redeeming quality. Ther is nothing likable about him. And it just cuts the whole story to shreds, since we want to see revenge for a good man dying. We don't care anything about this character. No one cares if his murderers ever see justice. So this story just falls flat. The movie becomes an ordeal. And there is no method in the spirit character's mean streak. It just falls flat. Just meanness for the sake of being another stupid spaghetti western. That is the chief difference between this and the vastly superior PALE RIDER, in which characters are explored and don't look like cartoon stereotypes. These stereotypes are hard to sit through without constant groans. Not the worst of Eastwood, but must be compared to his PALE RIDER any way you slice it, and any way you slice it, PALE RIDER is superior on all levels. There is no way any one can like this movie as much. So rent the other one if you want entertainment, if you want to think, if you want to feel, if you want anything.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pointless Trash!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A masterpiece of abysmally bad writing, direction and cinematography! What could Eastwood have been thinking, when he made this mess? The most bothersome thing about this atrocious assault on the cinematic art, is the depressing waste of as solidly talented a group of actors, that any director could ever hope for. As I watched this "film", I kept hoping that somewhere, in the aimless, pointless jumble of screaming, gunfire and explosions, there would finally emerge something vaguely resembling a plot; something that would connect all of the foolishness, but it never happened; it just continued on, becoming more and more ridiculous, in its mindless inanity. Even the least demanding of moviegoers should save their money and Eastwood should hang his head in shame!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Like Unforgiven, High Plains Drifter is very highly overrated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Another Eastwood piece of crap. Okay, from what i have seen, Eastwood has only directed and starred in two really bad and overrated films. As mentioned above, they were Unforgiven and High Plains Drifter. High Plains Drifter is a poor and unforgiving film that's premise isn't fully realised. The pacing is one of the issues that deserves looking into, and is the main reason why this film isn't deserving of it's current status on IMDb.Eastwood isn't the greatest actor in the world, and that certainly shows here. His direction as well isn't close to mastery or thrilling. Instead Eastwood tries to re-image the fading west in the supposed style of his earlier classics like The Outlaw Josey Wales or For a Few Dollars More. At times it can feel like a biographic account because of the slow moving shots for example.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Drift Somewhere Else</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of three movies to ever receive the '1' rating from me. Many reviews written by people are either 1 or 10, nowhere in between. Most people either like a film or don't, period. I am not one of those. My life is movies. I watch all kinds, and give them the rating they deserve.Now then... What the hell are you thinking Clint Eastwood? Where's the artistic talent? Maybe it was there but I was so appalled by the rape scene I missed it.. Rape can be a very antagonizing element when added properly to a film. This instance served no purpose. Also I kept falling asleep during the scene where the whole town (all 11 of them) are shooting at a dummy on a wagon for like half an hour.The problem with this movie is the choice of events to progress the plot. They seem tasteless and make the plot drag rather than keep interest. Western lovers will love this because it's a western. If, however, you love a good movie for all the reasons that make a movie good, avoid this one at all costs.Mystic River was also directed by Clint Eastwood and it sucks for the same reason this one does. Some people never change. Way to go! Another movie of his (Blood Work) had some pretty gross scenes and just focused on how decrepit he was, not to mention it was as predictable as the taste of celery.Clint Eastwood needs to schedule a luncheon with Spielberg, Tarentino, or Sam Mendes and maybe beg them for a few pointers.Dude, Clint, you don't deserve my name. Your movies are designed to appall, so I guess that makes you a success. Congratulations, you suck.</fullReview>
