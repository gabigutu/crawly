		<shortDescription>Awkward</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I like the 4 actors in the leading roles, and that was why I went to watch this, even though I suspected it would be bad.And yeah, it was bad. Not only the plot overall, where literally nothing happened. At all. Basically, every scene, and almost every line of dialogue was stupid and/or weird (and not the funny kind of weird). IMDb has it classified as "Adventure, Comedy, Romance", but I saw no adventure at all, and barely any romance; and the comedy in it was like... well, a parody of a parody, or something like that. And believe me, I am the type of person, who actually loves the "silly and cute" type of comedies (for which I am often labeled as "shallow"). But this was too silly even for my tastes. Most of the time it was just stupid, rather than silly. And even the moments that were supposed to be cute had enough cringe worthy elements in them, that the fun and that "aww" feeling in them was ruined. And I'm not a prude. I have laughed at this kind of humor before, and have had lots of fun watching movies that use it. But it has to be done well. Here, it wasn't. The writers didn't do a good job, period. Not even a decent job. It made those 4 actors look bad and they (mostly) don't deserve it. I know they're better than that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Much cringe</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Me and my father saw this just last week and to me..? It's cringe worthy. Now, there were some funny parts (tiny though) in this movie but what killed my mood and just made me and my father both cringe so much was the brothers. I felt like the movie was trying too hard to be like Step Brothers but instead we got Dumb and Dumber 3. At least the Dave brother was tolerable, but Mike? No. He was that one person you want to shut up. I could not laugh at the parts where he was shown. I just could not. Heck, the side characters were more laughable than him (I.E. the cousin and the bride).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mike and Dave need a better movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates' had some promise when the trailers first came out. I honestly believed this film would capture the tone of the first 'Hangover' movie, but something went wrong early on.1. I know this film was based on true events, and I guarantee the true events would have been far more entertaining than the ones depicted in this film. For he most part, the movie has a strong opening where we see how these two brothers party, but we also witness the aftermath of their wild antics. Things move well enough till we get to the point where they actually end up on Hawaii. At this point, things take a tumble off a cliff.2. Mike and Dave and played by Adam Devine and Zac Efron respectively. These two make an okay pair as brothers, but Adam Devine (especially) pushes the limit. Aubrey Plaza and Anna Kendrick are probably the worst additions to the cast, cause they are terribly unfunny. You would assume both Devine and Plaza would bring a certain level of comedy and timing, but they unfortunately don't and the jokes are misplaced.3. I'm not saying the movie is completely unfunny, but the most you get are a few chuckles here and there. Efron and Kendrick are better actors to star in a film like this, frankly this is below their standards. This should have been a direct to TV or DVD movie which featured some unknown/up-and-coming actors instead of bigger names filling the void. The side characters are annoying as f#%k, which in turn lowers the bar on the comedy.The movie fails to redeem itself and it's only passable as maybe a rental. No one should waste their time and especially money on going to the cinema to watch this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Obnoxious guys meet obnoxious girls. Not characters you want to spend a lot of time with.Anna Kendrick was so embarrassed she tried to hide behind bad wigs. Here's a movie maker that couldn't even make Hawaii look good. Based on the outtakes over the end credits the cast was having more laughs then the audience.It's a 98 minute movie that seems longer. You know the premise from the trailers but where are the laughs, few and far between. There are plenty of awkward moments that aren't funny.The location is wasted and seemed more like a dude ranch then a beach location. There is no need to see this in a theater. It will play just as strained and unfunny on a home platform.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is a whole new level of "waste of time and money"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love comedies. I watch a lot of them. Cute, silly, stupid, clever - any. Some - good, some - bad, some - are really not so good.But this was a whole new lever of terrible. The script sounds like being written by 12 years old, but they usually don't use "f-word" as often. Who talk like that, even in a comedy? As for comedy acting skills - the girl who played Tatiana and Zach Efron are the only watchable there. There is no excuse for this waste of time, money and good actors. I feel really sorry for the girls and Zach. I guess, every actor has a film on their resume they would rather forget about. This is definitely one of them. I hope this is not the new Hollywood standard for comedies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>They think they have just made them all better parties, but to their parents and to admittedly, reality, brothers Mike (Zac Efron) and Dave (Adam Devine) have only ruined all of the family events they've participated in for their wild party style. So when its Jaine's (Sugar Lyn Beard) turn to get married the family is taking no risks: Mike and Dave are to bring wedding dates to the wedding in order to be kept at bay. That's when Alice (Anna Kendrick) and Tatiana (Aubrey Plaza) put on the façade of being nice and ordinary girls to score a free weekend in Hawaii after discovering an advert from the two brothers. Yet when the chaotic spirits of both pairs start to explode, an apparently normal weekend turns into a ludicrous series of events."Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates" has good and charismatic leads, with natural comedic timing and an appropriately funny cast built around them with a script that has some effortlessly funny gags working. Yet, a fair amount of laughs are not enough to surmount the film's lack of heart, which often transpires into both annoying and unmotivated sequences and humor which is close to being mean spirited.What severely lacks from the film is a fresh and interesting comedic voice. As much as you feel the director's passion, I couldn't help but feel very cold about the style and visual choices the film makes. It is directed with almost no life, it doesn't feel alive and breathing, the shot choice is for the majority so basic it made my head ache at some point. There aren't any passages in the film where you feel inspired filmmaking and character or story being given a chance to flow. The editing is very mechanical and brings the film into feeling more like a series of gags, which might be occasionally good, but lack any kind of drive given the very predictable and clichéd script.Still, there's no denying the talent almost everybody has for comedy and even when handed what for most is very average material they manage to elevate it and thanks to what is sure to be a lot of improvisation they make the scenes that work, work really well and transcend what are otherwise deeply problematic character development elements. Efron's career has lately been all about these R-rated comedies and I have to admit I am one who really enjoys his effort in these: he is a great screen presence and always brings a palpable irony to the scenes. Adam Devine at this point is an enigma for me, I have no idea where he'll go in the future, that is because he has some really borderline annoying stuff here, but I don't know if it's thanks to him or the gag in itself I was never brought to a breaking point. I enjoyed probably all of his beats and he had many different ones to bring alive, succeeding in all of that variety.What is frustrating about the movie is how standard it feels and how much everything around it is striving to be better, but what we end up is this basic studio comedy that goes through every single beat we except and leaves the audience with little passion at all. The premise is right, the talent behind cast well, the script is trying to go to fresh places occasionally, but there is an incredible aura of average all around that simply flattens the film to the point of annoyance. Not to mention the ridiculous quantity of screeching women all over the place that had me almost covering my ears."Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates" is a film that delivers some good and at times great laughs thus succeeding a laugh prompter, yet a comedy film it lacks any depth of character or story to make it live any further than its closing credits unfortunately.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>rude, crude, lmao comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the funniest films in years, this crude and politically incorrect comedy was funny from the get-go thru the final credits. Never taking the plot too seriously, the film avoids necessary predictability, taking great advantage of the loose set-up to pile on the laughs throughout. I wasn't familiar with most of the cast, but whoever they were they delivered the laughs. This was the rare movie that didn't seem too long (cf. Cafe Society and Star Trek Beyond, both of which I saw this same weekend). An old-fashioned stupid sex comedy - a perfect escapist film for a day when the temp was climbing toward three digits. And it made me want to head back to Hawaii for my next vacation.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I won't beat around the bush here. This film is terrible because it is a case of what could have been. The cast are the reason I went to see the film. They severely disappointing for the majority of the film. There is one saving grace between Zac Efron and Anna Kendrick where they are are talking while sitting on a tree. It is sweet, nearly heartfelt and was thoroughly enjoying. That being said, this scene could not save the film from having one of the worst screenplays of all time. The cast were severely misused in this picture. Aubrey Plaza should use her quirky Parks and Rec talents here and this could be successful. She doesn't work as a conniving leading lady. Anna Kendrick should stick to her girl-next-door type of comedy. This crude comedy doesn't suit her. Zac Efron should do more work like Neighbours, where he acts very well against type as a disobeying college student. Here trying to play the voice of reason, it was an uncalculated risk that could have worked with an anyway decent script. Adam Devine is out of his depth. It pains me to say it because his work on Modern Family is brilliant and he is great in Pitch Perfect. This cast did not suit the film. Their personalities may, but not their acting skills. In summation, this picture is not worth seeing. The story has some potential when in the hands of a competent director and intelligent screenwriters. This is not the case. Poor directing, a truly awful script and the wrong cast, your 90 minutes is better spent watching a Woody Allen film which will give you more laughs and no awkwardness.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Funnier than it looked but unfortunately not funny enough.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on the "sort of" tries story of Mike and Dave Stangle. Two immature brothers who are told by their family to bring responsible dates to their sisters wedding.Another film that seems to be just over the mark from what I believe to be a style of comedy devoted to the stereotype of teenage humour. Or at least that's what I thought from watching the joyless trailers for this film. But as always I walked into the screening room with an open mind. So did I actually end up laughing at Mike And Dave Need Wedding Dates? Well yes I did laugh a couple of times.... Not very many but a couple. But the problem is the distance of time between each laugh was way too long. I laughed right at the very start and thought this could actually be good. The trailers might have just mis-sold the film. Unfortunately I didn't laugh for another 20-30 minutes. And this seemed to be how the pace of the film went. And the main reason I laughed at the specific gags I laughed at was because they made a difference to the constant barrage of crude "humour" being thrown towards the audience. The biggest problem seems to be that this comedy isn't funny. The lead actors do a good job in making some scenes funnier and Zac Efron delivers one of his best performances of the year ,but then that's easily done for him after the trainwreck on steroids known as Dirty Grandpa and the unfunny Bad Neighbours 2. If the script was better then the film would be better. That's really the only thing wrong with the film. There is one main stand out actress who can't act for all the money in the world and this is the person who is playing the sister of Mike and Dave.Once again 2016 delivers another unfunny comedy but this one isn't as bad as others before it. Still it might leave some people wishing Mile and Dave were never invited to the wedding in the first place ** &lt;-- Two Stars (Out Of Five)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wasn't terribly excited for the comedy of this film, simply because the trailers seemed to splice scenes at awkward moments - but I was laughing hysterically for nearly the whole film! The relationship between the four leads was both funny and heartwarming, and while the comedy took a crude turn at times, it never stretched reality so far that I was taken out of the moment. Sidenote - the girl who plays "little Genie" absolutely blew me away with her performance! Very unexpected! Overall the film was nicely cast, save for a few roles that required very specific looks. Great suspense and soundtrack, great location, and great costuming!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>People take comedies too seriously</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'll start with the obvious flaws of the movie. There was definitely some over-acting in this film however done in a very SNL type way which happens in a lot of comedies. The movie itself is raunchy and at times kind of corny. As with most Hollywood films the storyline was just okay. I would've liked more backstory on all the characters. For instance it's never said why Anna Kendrick's character gets left at the alter or how long they were together or how recent it happened. That all aside I thought it was pretty hilarious. It had some undeniably funny moments and even though these four characters seem shallow they all had human moments that showed a little depth to them. Besides how deep do you expect characters to be in a raunchy rom/com anyway. I think its funny when people see these type of films and complain about the language. People complained Dirty Grandpa was too over the top. It's literally called DIRTY grandpa. Anyway if you love funny over the top comedies with awesomely crude characters this will be hilarious to you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Raunchy, Harmless Fun,</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates is a good movie with a reasonably well developed plot and a terrific comedic cast. The highlight of the entire movie ls certainly the cast itself, the chemistry between Zac Efron and Adam Devine makes it all worthwhile, they are very convincing as brothers.As well as that, their is a natural connection between the lead actresses, Anna Kendrick and Aubrey Plaza, who are fiercely entertaining as two rebellious girls, certainly different from Kendrick's previous roles. The humour was, at times, tasteless. There is several innuendos, drug abuse and moments of sexual endeavours that simply came across as immature comedy that only young teenagers could really laugh at.Some of the films major plot points are also very absurd. For something that is suppose to be loosely based on a true story there is not a whole lot of realism, such as one of the girls throwing herself in front of a vehicle to get a guy's attention and a particularly discomforting masseuse scene, it was ridiculously exaggerated at times. Funny and with a charming cast, Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates may have its flaws but if you are looking for an enjoyable adult comedy, i's worth the watch. Two brothers must search for dates for their sister's wedding in order to keep them under control, but the two girls they find have other ideas. Best Performance: Adam Devine / Worst Performance: Alice Wetterlund</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK, this is my second official review on IMDb for a film that's had a bit of a bashing by some, a little bit intimidating if I'll be honest. Part of me wants to agree with the guys and gals that have given this sub-5. It doesn't have the depth that some comedies have, not all the characters are likable, some of their arcs are frankly unbelievable, and I have no idea whether some of the scenes are even slightly possible. If yes, sign me up, you'll know which scenes if you watch the film!HoweverDid I laugh my ass off for the best part of an hour and a half? Yes. Was I stone cold sober? No. Would I watch it again? Absolutely.Effron doesn't display the awesome acting you might be expecting from some of his other films, but he's definitely funny (if a little crass and childish at times, but hey it's called "Mike and Dave need Wedding Dates, what are you expecting?!?? My regular movie buddy even turned to me and said so much).There's romance, there's comedy and, kind of, adventure (not sure on the one film classifiers at IMDb). Focus on the comedy. Accept that this is childish. Pour yourself a glass of something yummy, and just enjoy it for its silliness. Simple fun to be enjoyed by anyone who can see past some of the stupid lines, nonsensical plot themes and obvious set ups. Still enjoyed it though!</fullReview>

Probably one of the most random films I've seen that doesn't make any sense.The only thing worth watching about the film is Zac Efrons face and body - it's an amazing body but not even that could save this film. Don't worry ladies, if you get hit in the face by a quad bike the day before your wedding, all the bruising and swelling will be gone for your big day! Another weird part of the movie is the very random massage the bride gets. One minute the girls are bad then good then bad, makes no sense! Also the bride takes drugs like oh OK that's fine to take these from you! Didn't find the film funny, it's search for laughs but doesn't deserve any. I actually got bored watching this film.

		<shortDescription>It does what a comedy is supposed to do</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film tells the story of two brothers who do not take things seriously and basically messed up every family event they have attended. Their sister is getting married soon, and they are ordered to bring a date each to keep them in check."Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates" is a funny film and made me laugh lots! The two brothers, Zac Efron and Adam Levine do look quite similar and they are convincing as brothers. Mike and Dave are seriously funny, but seriously annoying to their parents. The mishaps in the wedding are not unprecedented, I recall "The Big Wedding" with a stellar cast but I was thoroughly bored. In "Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates", the presentation of the events, and the whole package of nice location and beautiful people, and the hilarious story makes the film a joy to watch. I think the wildly different personalities of Tatiana and Alice provides a nice contrast to the brothers who are so similar to each other. I like how the film turns out in the end! I enjoyed watching it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>We have all been young and pumped up with bravado when young and beautiful, not giving a f*ck about older people and 'responsibility' (whatever that is), flexing our wonderfully, God-given slim physiques at the world.This pretty much describes Efron's career path. If films like this are anything to go by (another of his frat boy/party boy comedy onslaughts), getting old is going to hit him pretty hard, unless he concentrates on broadening his range rather than his impressive physique. (For those of you salivating for the money shot, you'll have to wait patiently as it's near the end of the movie).The main gripe I have with Mike and Dave?is that it isn't funny or crude enough. I'm a broad-minded man. Not as broad as Mr Efron's chest, but I can let a lot go, especially with gross out comedies...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Same Old Churned Out Junk, Very soft commercially-friendly humour, If you like the WNBA, this is the movie for you</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't understand how this got a 6.5, there are way funnier movies that have gotten 5's. This movie is really bad, it's the same old churned out wanna-be relationship humor. They should call this a romantic comedy first of all, too much mush. And there are some serious issues with the acting pair-ups. One of the big issues is with the actresses. They are really bad and not nearly as humorous as the male counterparts. I understand this is a big break for Aubrey Plaza but her entire role is unbelievable. None of her jokes or manner come across as funny, instead they come across as completely forced. Her brand of acting is dry, passive humour, and she found her place perfectly in the awkward Parks &amp; Recreation, this is out of her scope. The director is also making Aubrey Plaza and Ana Kendrick out to be these super hot, wild girls that Zack Efron falls in love with but it's not a match, the girls aren't crazy and they're not hot. I don't get how we , as viewers, are supposed to be drooling at Aubrey Plaza and Ana Kendrick the way the director makes them out to be. He needs to pick actresses who are funnier or who are hotter. A solid 50% of this movie is reliant on the female roles, it is not a male dominant movie by any means, in fact maybe even more than 50% are female scenes, so the girls in the movie needed to be on the same level as the male parts and that's not the case unfortunately. The idea of this movie is soft, commercially-friendly humour, if I were Zack Efron, i wouldn't have taken this role, he just did Neighbors 2 and is really evolving his sense of humour and his unique brand of comedy that is working well with Seth Rogen and others. This is way way too soft for him at this point. They need to pair him with funnier (and better looking actresses). Pull in an Ana Faris or Kristen Wig-esque actress and I think the movie might have been a solid 10% better. I was just really disappointed and felt it was a waste of money. Give us something new and funny and at least a bit interesting. Not to mention the movie is really vulgar at times, that doesn't add to its funniness because it's supposed to be a soft-humour movie bordering on a bit of a romantic comedy... Overall a very very confused movie that won't be remembered. A big budget 4. Heck honestly it's a 3 , it was really really bad at times.. There are so many more issues I can go into with the racial stereotypes played out in this movie as well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can't believe I'm about to write this line.MIKE AND DAVE NEED WEDDING DATES is the funniest movie I have seen this summer (so far).There, I said it and I don't even feel like I need a shower.I know - I'm surprised, too. &nbsp;MIKE &amp; DAVE is a pretty funny movie of the over-top, gross out type - think THE HANGOVER or NEIGHBORS, &nbsp;M&amp;D tells the story of...well...Mike and Dave (Adam Devine and Zach Efron)&nbsp;who think they are just "great partiers" at the various weddings they go to -&nbsp;as seen through their eyes&nbsp;in the opening credits, only to discover "the rest of the story" from their parents (Stephanie Faracy and the great, underused Stephen Root) - they go out of control to disastrous results. The remedy? &nbsp;Bring dates to their sister's destination wedding.They go about it by putting an ad on Craigslist that goes viral. &nbsp;Enter into it Alice and Tatiana (Anna Kendrick and Aubrey Plaza) two ladies that party even harder than Mike and Dave who B.S. their way to the wedding pretending to be shy, demure and ladylike. &nbsp;As you can imagine, chaos ensues.The key to this type of movie is the performances of the leads and in these 4, they are in good hands. &nbsp;Aubrey Plaza commands the first part of this movie as she is over the top and inappropriate from the start. &nbsp;She had me laughing early and often. &nbsp;Zach Efron joined in gamely and Adam Devine does what i think Adam Devine does, be the dimwit. &nbsp;I gotta admit that this act wears thin on me, but is serviceable here. &nbsp;Kendrick draws the short straw on this part of the movie as she seemed to be trying to hard in a part that was underwritten.And then an interesting thing happens...as usually occurs in these types of films, they leads find their "hearts" and the shenanigans tone down. &nbsp;When this happens, the relationship between Kendrick and Efron shine (I'd really love to see a movie with just these two) their heart and sincerity come to center stage and I really start to root for them. &nbsp;Fortunately, for me at least, this means that Devine needed to tone down his act, which I was grateful for. &nbsp;The unfortunate side effect is that Plaza had to tone hers down as well, and she became somewhat of a background player in the 2nd half of the film after carrying the first half.Comedic movies often rise and fall on the performances of the supporting players, the can be fun (see THE HANGOVER) or they can be non-descript (see the recent GHOSTBUSTERS), fun works, non-descript doesn't. &nbsp;This movie has fun supporting players starting with the afore-mentioned Root as Mike &amp; Dave's father. &nbsp; Add to that Alice Wetterlund's bi-sexual Cousin Terry, Mary Holland's uptight Maid of Honor Becky and Lavell Crawford's Best-Man Keith, they all have their moments to shine. &nbsp;But, for the me, the real unexpected surprise was Sugar Lyn Beard as the Bride, Jeanie. &nbsp;She was inappropriately hilarious in a role that could have been one note, but wasn't. &nbsp;Only Sam Richardson's groom, Eric, was not fun, but he wasn't supposed to be - and he wasn'tIs this movie an Academy Award winner? &nbsp;Well...no. &nbsp;Is it a fun way to spend a couple of hours on a warm summer evening - heck, yes! &nbsp;And isn't that what summer comedies should be? &nbsp;I think so.7 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank (of Marquis)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just watched this with my movie theatre-working friend-who had seen this before and enjoyed it-and his nephew. It's quite raunchy and has plenty of current pop culture references which I found quite funny. There's also some slapstick scenes that were also good for some laughs. There were also some touching ones. Zac Efron and Adam Devine and Audrey Plaza and Anna Kendrick fit their roles and do their stuff to mostly good effect. We're told this is based on a true story...sort of. Not doubt much of what is on screen is exaggerated for comic effect. This is mainly just the kind of movie just meant to entertain though some lines do make one think of what one's destiny is. Overall, I very much enjoyed Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Above-Average Hilarity with A Great Cast!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Surprisingly enough, the dames are raunchier than the dudes in the dim-witted, slapstick saga "Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates," with Zac Efron and Adam Devine standing in for the notorious, real-life Stangle brothers. Typically, when a movie advertises itself as "based on true events," audiences are inclined to roll their eyes and prepare for the worst kind of exaggeration. Ostensibly based on their madcap memoir "Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates: and a Thousand Cocktails," the movie "Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates" escalates their escapades to the extreme, but freshman director Jake Szymanski and "Neighbors" scenarists Andrew Jay Cohen and Brendan O'Brien have apparently captured the gusto of the real-life counterparts. The premise is simple. Father Stangle informs his two trouble-prone offspring that they must bring dates to their sister's wedding because otherwise they have managed to sabotage every previous family function were they showed up alone. According to People as well as Vanity Fair magazines, the guys took their dates to a nuptial in Saratoga rather than a Hawaiian wedding. Actually, they attended their cousin's wedding rather than their sister's marriage. Furthermore, despite trolling for total strangers as their dates with an outlandish Craigslist post that depicted them as half-human and half-horses, the Stangles took two girls that they knew. The Stangles have acknowledged that Hollywood has livened things up a little, but they claim that Zac Efron and Adam Devine have captured the essence of their monkey business. Ironically, Hollywood haywire here is stranger than the matter of the facts. Efron and Devine radiate enough chemistry and charisma that you like them as much as you laugh at them throughout their misadventures in this standard-issue nonsense. Meantime, as Anna Kendrick and Aubrey Plaza steal the show right out from under them as their daffy dates. Despite its predictable plot, "Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates" not only provides enough genuinely side-splitting antics, but also at 98 minutes, it doesn't wear out its welcome.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Silly enough to be entertaining</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ehh. "Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates" is a movie, and you can watch it, and maybe you'll laugh, but by the next scene you won't remember what exactly you were laughing at in the first place, and then when the movie is over you'll leave the theatre, get in your car, start the engine, and never think about "Mike and Dave" ever again.All this movie is, is a simple romantic comedy with some raunchy moments, and if you go in expecting that then you'll have a good time. The acting was fine; everyone did a good job, though Aubrey Plaza (who I really love) did annoy me at times, as did Adam Devine, but they also made me laugh, so I can't be too angry. The chemistry between the characters is believable; Aubrey and Anna really do feel like best friends, and Zac and Adam act like brothers. I believed their relationship, and as Zac and Anna slowly begin to fall in love, I believed it.In fact, by far the most interesting thing to watch in this movie is the budding relationship between Zac Efron and Anna Kendrick. They are both somewhat damaged or troubled characters, and just by being around each other they find healing and acceptance, each of them working out their problems by finally getting them off of their chest, something they would not have been able to do if they never would have met. Every time these two were on screen together I was absolutely riveted, and I wish that the movie would've just been about the both of them and their relationship, because they were the best part about this film. Their relationship and their backstory could've really been developed into something great, but for what it was in this film, it was effective and realistic enough to feel believable and sweet, and I would recommend watching the film just for their storyline."Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates" is a sweet, silly, breezy movie that you won't hate yourself for watching, but you won't remember in the morning.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>VIEWS ON FILM review of Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The title says it all. Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates (my latest review) marks the third time I've seen a comedy that takes place in Hawaii. The other two are 50 First Dates and 2008's Forgetting Sarah Marshall. "Wedding" which falls somewhere in the middle, is not as funny as it should be nor is it as raunchy as it could have been. A main character singing and grinding to "This Is How We Do It", been there. Another getting shockingly hit by a car, done that. Two female troupers getting high on Ecstasy and running around naked. You know what, that might be a new one.Anyway, despite scenes involving an unconventional method of having sex, a women's full frontal nudity that brings back the 70's, and a line in which someone says, "you look like Don Johnson made a baby with 'Zack' Morris", Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates only garnered some mild chuckles from me. This film sans script, has persisting moments that go on for too long, and has line readings that scream improvisation overload. The rest is just f-bombs, conventional gross-out gags, and obligatory outtakes during the end credits. Comic up-and-comers Adam DeVine and Aubrey Plaza along with chiseled Zac Efron, don't stand a chance with this material. Oh and by the way, save your money if you haven't seen "Wedding" yet. Its trailer which promotes summer movie salivation, is way more humorous.Directed by first-timer Jake Szymanski and distributed by 20th Century Fox, Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates introduces us to a sexual term known as the "push pop" (don't ask). The flick follows bumbling brothers Dave Stangle (Efron) and Mike Stangle (DeVine). They come from an upper class family, have jobs as partners in the selling of liquor, and have the maturity level of a couple of teenagers. They also like to wreak havoc on family social events (their destructive behavior resulted in a bad trampoline accident and the near death of their grandfather, no joke). When it's announced that their younger sister is about to get married, well their dad insists that they bring dates to the wedding instead of constantly just hitting on random ladies. Mike and Dave agree and eventually go on The Wendy Williams Show to put the veritable word out. In walks Alice and Tatiana (played by Anne Kendrick and Audrey Plaza). They are a couple of stoner chicks who live in a rundown apartment, say stuff like "hot as balls", and eventually get fired from their jobs as waitresses. Mike and Dave choose them because they come off as good girls. Bully for that. They do this only so they can get a free trip to The Aloha State (the location of the nuptials), bide their time by watching male porn in their hotel room, and sneak off to smoke the almighty reefer.Now "Wedding" is pretty lightweight satire despite a lot going on. I mean, you don't know where it is actually headed. There's a mixture of romance between Dave and Alice, a love/hate relationship between Tatiana and Mike, the bride-to-be getting hit in the face by a ATV (ouch), and a side plot involving a bisexual cousin trying to get with one of the ill- mannered rendezvous. In the end, it's really hard to care about anyone involved because the banter between the characters feels made up, forced, and badly off-putting. The similar-themed Wedding Crashers was no masterpiece but it felt more absolute. It had funnier zingers, an actual conclusion, and an actual resolution (its box office take of $285 million is proof of that).All in all, after seeing Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates, I'll probably see a lot worse comedies in my lifetime. And in jest, I'll probably see a lot more superior ones too. Rating: A fair 2 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wedding Crashers for the Snowflake Generation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>They're two brothers stuck in a permanent state of adolescence. They're two puerile reprobates pretending to be nice girls to hustle a free trip to Hawaii. The setting; a lavish Oahu resort where Mike (Devine) and Dave (Efron) will watch their little sister Jeanie (Beard) get married. The tables are set, the wine is chilled, the suckling pig has been basted; lock and load.Mike and Dave is yet another bawdy comedy in a summer already inundated with bawdy comedies. As such it has all the familiar contemporary trappings of the genre: basic camera coverage, bacchanalian sensibilities and an over-reliance on improvisation. Thankfully the main four; Efron, Plaza, Devine and Kendrick, find their niche within the plot. Their motivations are clear, their chemistry easygoing and their interactions with other supporting cast members is downright Shakespearean. This may come as a pleasant surprise to some. Comparing a mediocre comedy to Shakespeare? Well the plot is inducted by a quixotic request from the parents of the brothers in the hopes that finding wedding dates would pacify them. When they find their dates, each duo tries had to put up a front but ultimately succumb to their worst natures. Chaos ensues, truths are revealed, it ends in a wedding.Mike and Dave's greatest asset is its self-effacement. It knows it's juvenile, it knows it's unoriginal and it knows it's second life on blu-ray is going to be limited to Redbox and the paltry shelf space of the guy that peaked in high school. Yet it really doesn't care. It's here to make you laugh and it will resort to Adam Devine screaming at an octave only dogs can hear to do it. At least instead of the girls being relegated to the shrill "I'll give him one more chance to grow up" roles they're giving as much as they can take (if not more). I don't know about you but there are somethings even I wouldn't do for Rihanna tickets.If the film has a secondary asset it's in Mike and Dave's attempt to flip the script on gender roles and casual misogyny. By far the most noticeable permutation of this theme is Alice Wetterlund's libidinous cousin Terry who competes with the frat-house bravado of Devine's Mike for the heart of Tatiana (Plaza). While disappointingly underused, when Wetterlund is on screen hilarity naturally ensues. Sugar Lyn Beard likewise joins in the fun in two uproarious set-pieces that are brought to the tipping point by her chirpy disposition. She's much more than a caricature and her wedding is a little more than a plot device but rather an opportunity for all involved to grow as people.Of course just like the recent Neighbors 2: Sorority Rising (2016), Mike and Dave is unsuccessful in translating socially progressive themes. But unlike that retread, Mike and Dave does have its heart in the right place and its impact cannot be overstated. You can tell there's a lot of pieces cut from the final product (including a competitive streak between the brothers that doesn't go anywhere), yet I like to think most of those cuts were made to get Aubrey Plaza to not just shine but glimmer. She's been in two films with Zac Efron so far this year and both times she's proved her co-star a middling comedic force and the material she's given beneath her abilities.Running the gambit of predictable and safe comedy back-and-forths, Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates stands as one of the biggest surprises of the summer season. It may not successfully flip the script and many have derided it as a middling Wedding Crashers (2005) for the snowflake generation. Yet as a comedy it just works.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unbelievable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What happens when we take some of the strongest young talent around, mix it with a script that has limited use of some of the most recognized words in the English language, manages to avoid an NC 17 by some miracle and asks the audience to leave their brains outside? You get this offensive, tasteless, and mentally impaired movie.Loosely inspired by various comedies we have seen before but without any redeeming quality or grace, we witness a family that hasn't somehow killed any of its members, treat each other with the utmost disrespect and seems only concerned with coming up with the next opportunity to use foul language supposedly to keep the audience believing something funny is happening. I'm not against hearing a colorful word, but it's like using spices in the right amount, and pretty soon we're burned and bored.Here's a movie that makes the younger generation look pretty useless and dumb, Hawaii becomes a rather plain scenario because all of its charms disappear as we are confronted with every possible display of vulgarity and ignorance. There's not a single clever, cute, or funny moment. Well, maybe the reconciliation of one of the couples is a fresh moment of fresh air but that can't overcome the prevalent stench.There are issues with the proper use of language, too. As far as I know there was a man in the massage scene, but people kept using the feminine term. If that slipped by, I wonder if it was just intentional or just another instance of the effort to come up with anything memorable. All through the movie I was waiting to for a surprise since Zach and Anna were there, or maybe some of the inspiration would follow one of the leads from his hit TV show. An absolute waste of time, money, and talent. Stay away.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>he first two are Dirty Grandpa and The Brothers Grimsby. This movie is sorta kinda based on a true story. I like dirty comedies, so this was definitely my kind of humor. Anna Kendrick is adorable as usual, but it was fun to see her act like a stoner most of the movie. Adam DeVine and Zac Edron star as Mike and Dave, two slacker brothers who always screw up big family gatherings. When their sister, Jeanie is getting married, the family hold a type of 'intervention' for Mike and Dave and tell them to bring nice respectable women as their dates to the wedding. They even go on The Wendy Williams Show to advertise themselves, which catches the attention of Tatiana (Aubrey Plaza) and Alice (Anna Kendrick) Tatiana and Alice are two best friends who are slackers, too. They get drunk and lose their jobs. Alice is going through a depression because her fiancé left her at the alter. Alice and Tatiana meet up with Mike and Dave and all get along real well. They are soon off to Hawaii for the wedding. Pretty soon, Mike and Dave realize the girls are just as crazy as them. If you love dirty comedies, you'll love MIKE AND DAVE NEED WEDDING DATES!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Simply Terrible - A Waste of Time and Money !!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My wife and I were hoping for an uplifting comedy. The short previews looked OK. The film though is total crap. It was like they were trying to break a record to see how many times the "F" word could be used in a film. Zac Efron is capable of so much more and we have enjoyed some of his previous films, I don't know how he stooped so low to be a part of such a low class film. The jokes were flat the plot was ridiculous. The acting was poor and over done. What a waste of $28 and 2 hours. If I compare this film with The Wedding Crashers or Step Brothers which were both eons in front of this film in humor plot and acting quality, I don't understand how the films director could lead it to such a poor result. If you decide to go - well at least we tried to warn you. Save your Time &amp; Money and go see something else. My wife and I have made a pact that if we ever feel the way this film made us feel within the first 20 minutes we will walk out of the film &amp; either ask for a refund or tickets to something else worth watching.</fullReview>

The dates are annoying as hell, acting like female rap stars especially with their speak. I had high hopes for this and as ALWAYS the trailer is misleading. I laughed maybe three times and I cried once when I opened my wallet, twenty bucks to take a nap. Well, it's cheaper than getting a hotel. This was perhaps the longest film I've ever slept through. I don't need to see hairy bush, this isn't 1977. The last twenty minutes is soap opera drama and I tapped out, walked away and ripped my movie ticket. I need a refund.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wow. What a Joke.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's based on a true story? sort of. Essentially, it began with these two single fellas whose parents complain to them that they're always starting trouble at every party. So in order to stay in line, they are told to find dates for their upcoming sister's wedding in Hawaii. As a joke, they throw an ad up on Craigslist, their description for the essential date looking something like this: ? An excuse to get dressed up ? Open bar &amp; food all night ? Eccentric/downright dangerous bro-2-bro dance moves (may need to sign a waiver) ? Adventure ? Mystery ? Suspense ? True LoveRoyalties once our night's story is developed into a romantic comedy**if this happens (we estimate the chances at 85%) we refuse the right to let Ashton Kutcher play either of our characters, however, we will consider him for a supporting role.Next thing they know, they get over 6,000 responses from girls who find them attractive, leading to appearances in talk shows and a series of mock-dates. Fox Studios even made the last part of their ad come true. The unfortunate result is a wild and mean-spirited "comedy" that exists for all the wrong reasons.The two leading males, Mike and Dave, are played by the overly handsome Adam Devine (Mike) and Zac Efron (Dave). Their dates are played by the even more overly attractive Aubrey Plaza (Mike's date) and Anna Kendrick (Dave's date). None of these four young stars are as funny as you'd think they are, and they each resort only to screaming like drunk bozos to spice up the sleazy screenplay. They're all unbearably annoying to watch, Anna Kendrick in particular. The supporting cast was equally as horrible, say for instance Sugar Lyn Beard, who plays the soon-to-be-married sister of Mike and Dave. She's not exactly a "bad actress," she just has this annoying high-pitched voice that doesn't even sound that natural.But that's not even the worst of it. No, the worst is yet to come.There is no story, but rather a series of jokes that drag on and on and on without a clear punchline. Within the hour and thirty-eight minutes you'll need to suffer through, a girl falls off a roof and gets seriously hurt, a building catches fire at a 4th of July party, a grandfather dies at his birthday celebration, a girl gets hit in the face by an all-terrain vehicle and is heavily bruised the day before her wedding rehearsal, and all of these bits are intended to be the most hilarious thing ever. But did I laugh? Well no, but the audience in my screening were hysterical throughout the entire movie, which makes me incredibly worried.Emotional moments of redemption are attempted by the third act, but none of them are earned nor appropriate. The crazy events and dirty jokes all try to meet up in some sort of message about how life is not about getting the big things. Yeah, right. Just the number of "should I really be laughing at this" type of jokes glamorizes the romantic lifestyle rather than attacks it. So therefore, the redemption that this movie tries to get to is complete bull. In the end, Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates becomes exactly how it started as: a joke. It thinks that funny is about being rebellious and mischievous, but there's no way that has any affect in the long run.Overall Grade: F</fullReview>

The other actor, Adam Devine, is really funny, maybe a new Jack Lemmon? But those that represent the essence of fun in this film, are "the three graces", Anna Kendrick, Aubrey Plaza and Sugar Lyn Beard, they are the best ingredient, the spices of the movie. Very funny the twin sisters Andrea Miceli and Nancy Miceli. Also very funny Kumail Nanjiani, as Keanu, the massage expert. I liked the music too and the opening credits.

		<fullReview>Swearing is funny! Wait, no it's not. Nor is it clever, interesting or original. Yet the entire movie is laden with it, but not in a way that sounds authentic, just shallow. Cohen and O'Brien's screenplay is a mess, from the utterly stupid dialogue to the ridiculous plot points and clichés. But that's the least of the problems.Director Szymanski hasn't done a feature before. That much is clear. From the start, even the few gags that had potential fall flat, to the point where the audience doesn't know whether it's actually meant to be funny. A lot of the jokes are badly edited too, so the comic timing is way off - making a conversation faster doesn't make it funnier.On to the fab four. Efron has all but lost my respect, whereas Devine and Plaza never gained it in the first place. The real disappointment though is (Oscar nominated!!) Kendrick, whose horrendously fake emotional damage is cringingly bad - especially the constant wedding video-watching. It's been a long time since Up In The Air. And unsurprisingly the partnership that works best is hers and Efron's, who actually seem to have some brief connection at one point before it predictably diminishes.But, crucially I didn't fall asleep, or feel like it was a waste of two hours. Some moments were preposterous (massage), racist (black Ken) and crude (ecstasy-induced nudity), and I didn't once laugh (except at a blooper), but the time passed pretty quickly. Like in the movie, it might be worth popping a few pills first to make it more than just tolerable. Still at least the real Stangles made lots of money from their dreadful story...2/5</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Comedies set in Hawaii instantly remind me of 50 First Dates and Forgetting Sarah Marshall, and this isn't far off the mark. It's in the same vein as the comedies with the same title structure, Harold &amp; Kumar Get The Munchies and I know Pronounce You Chuck &amp; Larry, stupid but entertaining, and this happens to be one of the funniest films I've seen this year. It's the silly leading the crazy with brothers Mike, Adam Devine (Pitch Perfect, Workaholics), and Dave, Zac Efron are forced into getting 'nice' dates to keep them in check for their little sister, Jeanie's (Sugar Lyn Beard) wedding. Their online ad for dates go viral and in stream hundreds of annoying and funny applicants. But they end up getting duped by equally immature BFFs and real life best friends, Tatiana played by deadpan comedienne Aubrey Plaza (Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World, Parks &amp; Recreation, Funny People) and Alice played by Pitch Perfect singer star Anna Kendrick (Up In The Air, Into The Woods.) I could be wrong but I believe this might be Jake Szymanski's first main feature debut after many TV shorts and episodes, who is quite familiar with comedy being credited to directing shorts titled Denise Richards' Funbags, Zac Efron's Pool Party and Three Matthew McConaugheys and a Baby. It's hardly surprising that he has a good understanding at what makes people laugh especially with shock and awe. There's plenty of outrageously, awkward scenarios which ensures laugh-out-loud moments such as the quad bikes, Kumail Nanjiani (Central Intelligence, Life As We Know It) as Keanu the masseur and some embarrassing sexual encounters. What probably most shocking, if not too over-exaggerated, is that this is actually based on a true story, with the real life Mike and Dave getting cameos with over-competitive cousin Terry and according to a recent Vanity Fair interview, the brother are pretty much spot on!It's hilarious in parts and actually, going against the critics hate parade, it's not a bad story, the script is better than a lot of comedies out there, it doesn't lose slack and the soundtrack is good. You can tells the cast had fun with the out-takes and there's even a needless Branscombe Richmond (Renegades) cameo. (I was shocked to see him) not necessarily for the big screen but certainly a worth while watch for a barrel of laughs.

		<fullReview>This movie took me off guard, even though I knew I had an idea that it had to do with a wedding theme. A 98 minute movie directed by Jake Szymanski had comedy in it, but it also had an emotional attachment when it came to the big "I do's". One of the reason why I was interested on watching this movie was because one of the actors Zac Efron - Also known as Dave Stangle. I wont do the movie spoiler here, but if your currently married and don't think you can still manage any topic thats related to weddings, I don't recommend watching this movie. Unlike myself, I didn't think the whole entire film was going to be related to weddings, but it did. So I did get emotional, since my whole marriage didn't go as planned. But overall it was a beautiful movie, the meaning behind it was to never give up, that in every bad situation there's always a chance to fix things and that no matter what love can conquer every tragedy (for those that fight for hope). I just thought that this movie was going to be a little funnier and not so obvious when it cane to predicting what was going to happen next. I guess that even though I am a hopeless romantic, I felt like the theme of this film was divided into several categories and not just focused on one. The whole Production was filmed very well, the angles and locations that were chosen for this film made it looked very propelled. The editors did a great job, not once did I feel like my eyes got bored and looked away to see what was on my phone or if someone texted me. So it did kept me interested due to the fast cutting of the clips. The Audio production also did a great job on choosing the music for this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates is your typical raunchy summer comedy. The movie follows two wedding crasher like brothers that are given to order to bring respectable dates to there sister's wedding. In the typical comedy way, two not so respectable girls answer the call and pose as the respectable girls they need to be all in order to get a free holiday.Like most comedies, I often try to come into them with a low expectation. This was, if it was a decent laugh, then I'm not going to be disappointed. If it ends up being an all time classic comedy, even better. If you are planning to see this movie, I suggest to go in with these low expectations. I say this not because it is an awful movie in anyway, but because I it serves as a great TV watch. In the end, the focus of comedies is to make you laugh and at no point during this film did I feel that this movie was failing at this job.I thought the chemistry between the main four characters were fantastic. While there wasn't many situation where the four shared to focus at the same time, I thought the combinations of DeVine and Efron as brother, Kendrick and Plaza as best friends, and Efron and Kendrick and Plaza and DeVine as their paired romantic interests all worked really well. I thought from a cast perspective they all bounced off each other really nicely and created a real natural flow.The only downside I really had with the cast was DeVine. While I thought he worked really well in his pair ups, I just felt that as far as quality, his behind with the others such as Efron and Kendrick playing stand out roles. For me, DeVine shares a problem I also have with Melissa McCarthy in that I think in a supporting comedic role they are fantastic but when it comes to stepping up into that main role where they have to touch on more than one emotion they struggle a bit. This can really be seen in a scene where both Efron and DeVine's characters are upset and Efron pulls a real cry and DeVine just scrunches up his face. While it was pretty funny, it is scenes like that that shows he lacks that extra dimension. I felt like they could have easily had a few really emotional scenes throughout this film but with someone like DeVine, they can't tone it back and play a serious scene.Overall, this was a nice easy laugh. I don't think you have to be into the complete adult humour to enjoy but you have to be matured enough to see the funny side of some of the jokes.7/10</fullReview>

There was a definite opportunity to make this film far better than what we got but overall the film was 'ok'. Nothing more and nothing less. Watch it when it comes on the Netflix or the Redbox but don't spend more than matinée price at the cinema. This is no Hangover but a film worth watching with a couple drinks in you. Thats pretty much it with this. The most disappointing aspect of this film was the fact that I was able to predict its story line from its trailer and that speaks volumes.

		<fullReview>Is this movie dirty, raunchy, sophomoric? Yes. Is it funny? Hell yes. A lot of movies now seem to base humor off of dick jokes, vulgar language, sexual content, which lately has been over-saturated in the film industry. This movie's humor definitely stems from that content, but it made me laugh my ass off. It didn't feel like they were trying too hard, and even though you could tell there wasn't much of a script, you could see the actors were having fun, and that showed on screen. I thought it was one of the funnier R rated movies I've seen in a while. So much better than Dirty Grandpa, which has Zac Efron and Aubrey Plaza as well, but where Dirty Grandpa was just flat out dirty with very little funny moments, Mike and Dave had tons of funny moments. If you can get past the fact it's immature, you'll have a good time. Not the greatest story, but it's got some heart and even more laughs. Enjoy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went into this movie thinking I was gonna see something worse then Dirty Grandpa, the premise didn't make me want to give it the benefit of the doubt, which is loosely based on a true story.Mike(Adam Devine) and his younger brother Dave(Zac Efron) are asked by there parents to bring wedding dates to there sisters wedding in Hawaii, in hopes to keep them under control, cause Mike and Dave seem cause mayhem at every party they are at. So both of them become internet sensations when they advertise that both are need of wedding dates, even go on Wendy Williams. After so many interviews with very little luck, they meet Tatiana(Audrey Plaza) and Alice(Anna Kendrick), and feel a little connection, and end being there wedding dates. But little do Mike and Dave know that Tatiana and Alice are not what they seem.Unlike Dirty Grandpa some of the jokes here really hit there mark. Efron here this time plays a great straight man playing off of Devine insane zaniness, the two do have great chemistry. Audrey Plaza basically playing a similar character from Dirty Grandpa, but here seems to be putting more effort. Anna Kendrick is good too, showing more to her character. The four leads do play off each other quite well. But some of the other gags go further than they should, to the point where it wasn't funny anymore. The other supporting cast do well with what they are giving.It's not the unfunny disaster that was Dirty Grandpa, but nowhere near the comedy masterpiece that was The Hangover(2009).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Horrendous Tinder jokes for 1.5 hours</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A few years ago late night comedic TV show hosts used to do this thing where they'd just use internet terms outside of the internet as the entire punchline to a joke. They'd say "YOLOOOOO!!!" and "L-O-L" and "Hashtag_____". The joke was that they were old and using young peoples lingo and internet things are funny so you don't even need to write any material just say those words apparently. That was some of the cringiest work going about. The modern version of that is just saying "Tinder" over and over and over again or using shock words like "finger ing" and saying that over and over and over until it looses its comedic shock. Thats what happened in this movie. Seriously there was at least 9 tinder jokes that were awkwardly slapped into scenes. Adam devine was the only saving grace in this flick. And even still it was a weak poor performance from him. You're better off stringing together an entire season of Workaholics and watching that instead of this, because this felt like a workaholics episode but 50% less funny. It was really cring-y to watch the 2 chic characters try and act drunk for a good portion of the movie. They just slur their words and hicup a lot and mention "fist ing" and "tinder" and "finger ing" over and over, its not funny unless you've never been exposed to dirty humour before. Why didn't they just have a few drinks before filming? do some method acting would've made it more convincing then watching a clearly sober person act drunk. It looks like They were sipping on a fresh wheat grass juice under an umbrella and the director yelled "action" and they just started swaying around and slurring dialogue to appear inebriated. Hollywood seems to be the opposite to where it was years ago. The actors were all completely smashed drunk and on screen trying to act sober like Oliver Reed. The last thing I saw Audrey plaza in was that Father John Misty video and she was ace in those 3 mins. Sucked hard in this film though. Im not sure if we have reached peak shock humour but i'd say we'd be close. There's only so many times you can just shout shocking words before the audience members become accustomed to those and it no longer has a comedic angle. At least in Workaholics they'd get creative with words, mixing stuff together and generating some new phareses like "Ayoooo-maggots!" The worlds changed and I don't think you can get away with this sort of thing anymore. You have to at some point start writing some proper material instead of relying on the laugh that comes from an audience member hearing a dirty word they've herd a million times in private but never on the big screen. I think directors are forced to get Effron to take off his top in each movie because it translates to an extra 10 million views world wide $$$$$$$$. Hey the kid looks good. Shocking actor. Yes Audrey plazza even said "Hashtag" out loud as an actual joke in this film. pure toilet movie. Rubbish Trash Garbage</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'MIKE AND DAVE NEED WEDDING DATES': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five)A raunchy romcom, based on the true story of brothers Dave and Mike Stangle; who famously took out an ad on Craigslist, looking for wedding dates. The film stars Zac Efron and Adam Devine, as the Stangle brothers, and it costars Anna Kendrick, Aubrey Plaza, Sugar Lyn Beard, Sam Richardson and Stephen Root (most of the four leads have previously worked together, on multiple other movies before). It was directed by Jake Szymanski (a veteran TV director, making his feature film debut), and it was written by Andrew J. Cohen and Brendan O'Brien (who previously co-wrote both 'NEIGHBORS' films together, also starring Zac Efron). The movie's received mostly poor reviews from critics, but I thought it was mildly funny. Mike and Dave Stangle (Devine and Efron) are two brothers that run an alcohol selling business together; and they also party excessively. They're notorious, among their family members, for always ruining family get-togethers. So their sister (Beard), and father (Root), both insist they bring wedding dates to their sister's Hawaiian wedding (to help them avoid having another accident). In order to find dates, the Stangle brothers put up an ad online (which goes viral). Two other 'hard-partying' friends (Kendrick and Plaza) see them on television, and decide to trick the brothers into inviting them (by posing as nice girls). The movie has a great premise, I think, and it's definitely funny (at times). The cast is all great in it, and the direction is decent. The script could have used a few more rewrites though; the genuine laughs are just too few and far between, and a lot of the line delivery seems forced (at no fault of the actors, I think). A lot of comedy flicks fall victim to these flaws though; just none of the great ones. This isn't a great one.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://vimeo.com/176638264</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's over-the-top and ridiculous but delivers some hilarious moments</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As of today, there are a few particular aspects that define R-rates comedies: vulgar sex humor, abundant profanity, and a story with little ambition; all of this sums up this hysterical comedy directed by Jake Syzmanksi in this feature film debut. Zac Efron and Adam Devine take positions of the lead roles and bring middling efforts to bring on the laughter. At some degree, they succeed but their over-the-top goofy portrayals of the lead characters make this comedy both fun and obnoxious to sit through, though it is slightly better than Zac Efron's previous outing when he starred opposite Robert De Niro in 'Dirty Grandpa' earlier this year. Enter Efron and Devine as Mike and Dave Stangle, two hard- partying brothers who've become known for going to their family gatherings with nothing bigger on their agenda than to party their souls out, and their reckless, party-to-the-death behavior often leads to disaster. Whether they cause a fire or send a family member or friend to the hospital; they always seem to be the disastrous catalysts of their family gatherings. When their younger sister Jeanie (played by Sugar Lyn Beard) is getting married in Hawaii, their parents (played by Stephen Root and Stephanie Faracy) propose an elegant solution: the boys must each bring themselves a date to keep them under control. In a desperate efforts to find nice dates, they meet Alice (played by Anna Kendrick) and Tatiana (played by Aubrey Plaza) who start off as nice young ladies, but on vacation turn out be even bigger party animals. Before they know it, Mike and Dave are forced to deal with the chaos that ensues. If you are amused about by characters indulge in a constant parade of sex jokes and hijinks, and occasionally slapstick humor without a pinch of substance, this just might be a movie for you. Otherwise, you are likely in for 98 minutes of tedium. Surprisingly, this film is just a little more than that. Though the main story is nothing of true aspiration, Zac Efron and Adam Devine bring a fair amount of heart and laughter to the screen; even when they have the tendency to annoy in some scenes screaming and yelling like children high on caffeine. Aubrey Plaza and Anna Kendrick also make a wild bunch, and the chemistry between is fine, though not great; especially as it's hard to buy Kendrick as a raunchy bad girl who gets high on ecstasy. The humor these four bring to the screen often ranges from to somewhat funny, to amateurish, and to deeply absurd. While most of the humor isn't particularly smart, especially the childish antics perpetrated by the two main leads; these four actors at least use some of their comedic chemistry. As typical as many average comedies, there jokes don't always land, some of which fall too far in the category of a sitcom. When Efron and Devine are on screen together, the jokes are dumb; when Plaza and Kendrick come on screen, the jokes haves little substance. In the end, not many of the jokes are remotely quotable.Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates is a bit of a mixed bag of dumb, funny humor and hit- and-miss comedic material. Overall, this is an okay film but is not destined pleased everyone, particularly those seeking for a comedy with a smart, witty story because this movie doesn't quite have one. But as long as the laughs there, some can easily come to appreciate this hysterical comedy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Fun And Easy Watch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Zac Efron has starred in no shortage of comedies lately. With Dirty Grandpa and the Bad Neighbours franchise under his belt, he is really starting to flex his comedic muscles (so to speak). Therefore, it comes as no surprise that he stars in this hilarious 'loosely based on true events' romp, Mike And Dave Need Wedding Dates.Zac plays Dave Stangle, a dim-witted lad who is in the alcohol business with his equally dim older brother Mike (played by Adam Devine, who you will remember from Pitch Perfect and Modern Family). Both are notorious for their destructive behaviour at family get-togethers so when they are confronted by their fed-up father to bring sensible dates to their sister's upcoming destination wedding, they are on a mission to find the perfect girls.They end up with Alice and Tatiana (played by Anna Kendrick and Aubrey Plaza respectively) who are far from wholesome but manage to convince the boys that they are. It's not until various unconventional situations occur that the ladies' true colours are revealed to the Stangle brothers who are now facing the dilemma of potentially ruining yet another family event.This film is what you would expect ? a lot of crude humour and ridiculousness so don't expect anything more. My biggest fear was that (like most movies of this nature) the best bits are all in the trailer, leaving the film empty of anything fresh however I can safely say there are plenty other laughs to be had throughout. No Oscar nominations here, but a fun and easy watch.motherofpopcorn.wordpress.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The 3rd Funniest Dirty Comedy of 2016!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first two are Dirty Grandpa and The Brothers Grimsby. This movie is sorta kinda based on a true story. I like dirty comedies, so this was definitely my kind of humor. Anna Kendrick is adorable as usual, but it was fun to see her act like a stoner most of the movie. Adam DeVine and Zac Edron star as Mike and Dave, two slacker brothers who always screw up big family gatherings. When their sister, Jeanie is getting married, the family hold a type of 'intervention' for Mike and Dave and tell them to bring nice respectable women as their dates to the wedding. They even go on The Wendy Williams Show to advertise themselves, which catches the attention of Tatiana (Aubrey Plaza) and Alice (Anna Kendrick) Tatiana and Alice are two best friends who are slackers, too. They get drunk and lose their jobs. Alice is going through a depression because her fiancé left her at the alter. Alice and Tatiana meet up with Mike and Dave and all get along real well. They are soon off to Hawaii for the wedding. Pretty soon, Mike and Dave realize the girls are just as crazy as them. If you love dirty comedies, you'll love MIKE AND DAVE NEED WEDDING DATES!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Here's the Pitch Perfect-meets-Dirty Grandpa mashup that precisely no one asked for. And it's dumb. And sometimes hilarious.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's a definite Apatow-type genre comedy making the rounds these days, consisting of semi-improvised dirty talk by young ne'er do wells who suddenly get super wholesome around act three. This is one of those, and it's a decent example of the breed ? which is to say, not particularly intelligent and almost entirely dependent on (a) its cast and (b) the ability of said cast to pull off funny one liners.Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates isn't a good movie, but it does get you from (a) to (b). (Like that?)The titular Stangle brothers (Dave, played by Zac Efron, and Mike, Adam Devine) are thinly-sketched liquor salesmen with a serious failure to launch; while they bounce around all Animal House style, their parents lament the brothers' (utterly contrived) history of ruining family gatherings (by generally being manic and partying too hard). The parents implore the duo to stop chasing women and to find real, actual dates for their dear little sister's wedding.Their Craigslist ad soon goes viral, landing them a TV spot and the attention of an even bigger pair of screw ups, freshly unemployed drunks Tatiana and Alice, played by Aubrey Plaza and Anna Kendrick. The wily ladies hatch a scheme to clean themselves up, land the guys, and score a free trip to Hawai'i. Of course, they do.The wedding gets royally boned, but that's not particularly funny or interesting. People also get sporadically wholesome, and ditto on that. These characters are thin and none has much of an arc save for bouncing around like pinballs between wholly artificial deep reveals. If it weren't for Plaza's foul-mouthed quips over sly, knowing glances, Kendrick's actually-kind-of-decent-after-all damaged damsel, Devine's babyface rants, and Efron's pure comedic charisma, this film would founder. But every now and then, the guys ? and it is generally the guys, I think ? hit one out of the park. There's some legitimately funny stuff in here. (It also has low points, like the cringe-worthy, 2010-era Adam Sandler-style cutting of the ATV crash scene. Feels like you're watching a cheap B-movie comedy.) Upshot, it's uneven.The supporting cast is decent here. I doubt you'll rush to the marquee to see Stephen Root, but he's good as the frustrated dad; Sugar Lyn Beard (now there's a name) does more with the little sister bridal role than she probably needs to, hamming it up to good effect. I enjoyed the choice of Sam Richardson as her fiancé, and similarly that the filmmakers made precisely no mention of the fact that the pending marriage was interracial. (But before you ring the bell and declare social justice achieved, consider the underlying premise of women as simple arm candy to soothe and control hyperactive man-boys ? and gaze also upon Alice Wetterlund's "Cousin Terry," a comic-relief predatory lesbian with a Tesla who certainly comes off like a stereotype, but to my knowledge, isn't ? at least not yet.) Bell not rung.I will say, for a movie about pretending to be someone you're not, this film graciously shortchanges the inevitable reveal. (You know, that moment when a protagonist has fibbed to get where they are, reaped the rewards, and then has to come clean, despite having developed real feelings in the interim? their poor counterpart is always dumbstruck and super hurt, whereas in real life they'd likely have smelled a rat and seen it all coming.) Reveals happen here, of course, but they don't seem to matter very much to anyone. Blink and you'll miss one of them. I like that.So, overall? I loved the first 15 minutes of this movie. I loved various other minutes of it, but nowhere near all of them. It has a saggy and dumb middle and it misses its shot at greatness by a substantial margin. But sometimes you're in the market for a lousy, R-rated comedy with a few high notes, some good looking leads, improvised quips, and nice Hawaiian scenery. There are other, better entries in this slim little canon (Forgetting Sarah Marshall comes immediately to mind), but this one isn't all bad. Summer's here. See a movie.Haus Verdict: About as smart as you thought it would be (not very), and sometimes a whole lot funnier. Efron really makes it for me. Is that weird?

		<shortDescription>Fun but lacking in chemistry</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When 'The Hangover' came out in 2008 and was a massive success, my hope was that this would signify an evolutionary step in the comedy film world. A step where story would drive the humour, rather than other way around. That was what made that film so great. Sadly though, it seems to have almost gone the other way and now almost every comedy we get has next to no story and simply relies on comedic actors to carry the entire show. The problem with that is that there are very few actors in Hollywood who can actually pull it off. Is Adam Devine one of them? Sadly, not quite yet.Zac Efron seems to be making a career out of being the straight guy playing along side a comedian who is expected to carry the show. Just film after film these days, it seems to be all he does. He's good looking and appeals to female audience members I'd imagine, but he also sucks a lot of life out of films. I can honestly say in 'Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates' he failed to make me laugh once. Can a film (a comedy for that matter) survive with one of its two leading characters being that ineffective? I don't think so.There's some fun to be had here though. Anna Kendrick and Aubrey Plaza deliver a few laughs and Devine gives his everything in every scene and it comes off now and then. There really isn't a lot for them to work with though. The fact that is based on a true story is a bit of a joke. It is based on one, but the true story itself is about as uninteresting as you could possibly imagine. Two guys put an ad out looking for some dates to a wedding - stop the presses! Apparently they did, and even thought it was enough to make a movie out of. I assure you however, it wasn't.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's Wedding Crashers for stupid people.. That's about what I thought of it for the first 15 minutes. I was fidgeting in my seat, cringing at every last failed joke. Then the film took off. Holy God did it take off. The film waits until the duo and their dates come to Hawaii for the big comedic setups, and every one of them is a smash hit, including the best choreographed and outrageous massage scene in any movie I've seen. Efron and Devine are a great team. Devine has some excellent comedic timing, and a John Belushi-type charm.. albeit some of his performance is a bit over-the- top. Plaza and Kendrick are delightful as the girls, although it seemed Kendrick was given way more screen-time than Plaza. This is an uneven film, but you have to stick with it, and by the end, you'll realize it's worth sitting through. The big gags are worth it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw "Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates", starring Zac Efron-Dirty Grandpa, The Lucky One; Adam Devine-the Pitch Perfect movies, Mama's Boy; Anna Kendrick-the Pitch Perfect movies, Scott Pilgrim vs. the World and Aubrey Plaza-Dirty Grandpa, Scott Pilgrim vs. the World.This is an 'R' rated comedy that is based on a true story, sort of-At least that is what it says in the opening credits-that happened in 2013. Mike &amp; Dave Stangle are two real life brothers that are the text book definition of party animals. When their sister is getting married, she wants them to shape up and play nice, at least during her wedding. Zac &amp; Adam play the Stangle brothers and at every family get together, they take partying to the limits and beyond, usually with things ending in explosions or something being burned to the ground. After their parents and sister hold a family meeting-more like an intervention-to get them to act nice, Zac &amp; Adam decide that their best chance to shape up is to go on Craigslist and place an ad, saying that they need 2 nice girls to take to their sister's wedding-all expenses paid in Hawaii. Of course they are deluged with offers-who doesn't want a free trip to Hawaii?-but the lucky winners are Anna &amp; Aubrey. The only problem? Anna &amp; Aubrey turn out to be party animals in sheep's clothing-They are just pretending to be good girls for the free trip, of course. The humor is really 'R' rated material, so if you are easily offended by such then you might be better off seeing something else. I enjoyed it and thought it was good, raunchy fun . During the end credits, there are some out takes &amp; bloopers. It's rated "R" for language, drug use and sexual content-including nudity-and has a running time of 1 hour &amp; 38 minutes. I would buy this on DVD.</fullReview>

I was just hoping for a few laughs and instead got a really fun movie that doesn't take itself too seriously. Zac Efron and Adam Devine deliver in their own right but Anna Kendrick and Aubrey Plaza definitely steal the show. Director Jake Szymanski does a great job of keeping it light and funny while still delivering a story that tugs at the heart strings, not a lot but enough to make you care what happens. Would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a fun movie that'll make them laugh the whole way through.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Some may know that I am a big fan of Zac Efron and his comedy line of movies and 'Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates' falls right along that line. This film had plenty of hilarious moments throughout and had me genuinely entertained with the amount of over-the-top humor it presented. On top of the moments, Anna Kendrick, Zac Efron, Adam Devine, and Aubrey Plaza did a great job every moment they were on screen, bringing the laughs every chance they could. I have been waiting to see Anna Kendrick let loose on screen for a while and with this film and also 'Get A Job', it was awesome to finally see that. Adam Devine is naturally ridiculous with every on-screen shot and never fails to get a laugh out of a crowd and even his co-stars (See gag reel at the end of the film). Although hilarious, an avid movie lover will notice the pointless and utterly ridiculous plot and sometimes way over-the-top antics. Regardless, this is just another raunchy comedy fit for mindless entertainment. I am a fan and if you like movies like 'Neighbors' or 'Dirty Grandpa', it will be one you will be a fan of too.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This dumb comedy has a few laughs, but ultimately is unsatisfying. Adam Devine and Zac Efron play a couple of dufuses who are forced by their sister (Sugar Lyn Beard) and father (Stephen Root) to find dates for her Hawaiian wedding. The brothers post an ad on Craigslist which goes viral (this much of the film was based on a true story). They soon attract two sloppy potheads, Aubrey Plaza and Anna Kendrick, who pretend to be normal, upstanding ladies to win the trip. When they get there, their baser natures soon fly free. The four of them get into a bunch of trouble. I saw this mainly for Kendrick and Plaza, who are both funny and extremely sexy in the film. Of the two guys, Devine gets a few good moments. Efron doesn't get much to do at all, which is disappointing considering his excellent turn earlier this year in Neighbors 2. The main problem here is a lack of ambition. The cast is game, but the screenwriter (and I'm sure the army of punch-uppers behind the scenes) don't give them enough funny jokes. It wouldn't be a bad way to waste a Sunday afternoon, but I wouldn't make an effort, either.</fullReview>

This movie didn't get under the lowest bar for a funny, entertaining and well acted comedy. I barely chuckled until the outtakes. Maybe they should have made the movie with all the outtakes instead. There were younger folks laughing. I must have a different view of what's funny, more old school. Some of the best comedies had all pro comedians, Richard Pryor and Gene Wilder in Silver Streak. John Candy in Uncle Buck. the 80's side splitting Porky's and Tommy Boy. In the way back machine, Some Like it Hot was a 10 star funny Bone breaking movie. I gave Mike and Dave a 5 star rating because it just didn't have what it takes compared to the 8, 9, 10 comedies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>They say "familiarity breeds contempt", but I say, "familiarity breeds contentment", well, cinematic contentment anyway? and familiarity ain't bad for cinematic chemistry either. Take the cast of the raunchy comedy "Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates" (R, 1:38) for example. Adam DeVine and Zac Efron, playing the title characters, respectively, have previously worked together in the "Neighbors" movies. The two female leads, Anna Kendrick and Aubrey Plaza, have also done two other films together (2014's "Life After Beth" and "Scott Pilgrim vs. the World" in 2010) and are good friends in real life. Kendrick and DeVine appeared together in the "Pitch Perfect" movies, while Efron and Plaza shared the screen in 2016's "Dirty Grandpa". What's more, this film's co-writers, Andrew Jay Cohen and Brendan O'Brien, also shared writing credits on those "Neighbors" movies. And, to take the "familiarity" theme one step further, Movie Fans may already be familiar with this movie's basic premise ? if they remember hearing about the real-life 2013 events (or read the book) on which the Stangle Brothers' story is based.Mike and Dave Stangle are trouble makers, but they consider themselves party makers. After all, injuring wedding guests with an ill-advised trampoline stunt, shooting fireworks into a camper and causing an uncle to have a heart attack at his anniversary party are just a few isolated incidents in an ongoing string of party awesomeness, right? Well, these two brothers' parents (Stephen Root and Stephanie Faracy) aren't going to take chances on one of these legendary mishaps ruining the upcoming Hawaiian wedding of Mike and Dave's little sister, Jeanie (Sugar Lyn Beard), to the kind but boring (kind of boring) Eric (Sam Richardson). Jeanie suggests (and mom and dad insist) that Mike and Dave bring dates to the wedding ? to keep the pair in line. The guys don't like having their style cramped, but they agree, for Jeanie's sake.Not really knowing how to find "nice girls", Mike and Dave place on ad on craigslist. The ad goes viral and the guys are soon meeting a number of the, ahem, "candidates" in a sequence reminiscent of Eddie Murphy's character searching for "his queen" in 1988's "Coming to America". An appearance on "The Wendy Williams Show" brings this quest to the attention of down-and-out besties Tatiana (Plaza) and Alice (Kendrick). (Think of the "Dumb and Dumber" characters, with nicer legs, a few more IQ points and lots more booze.) The girls refashion themselves into nice girls, engineer an encounter with Mike and Dave, and before you can say "Aloha", the foursome are on a plane to Jeanie's destination wedding.Tatiana and Alice manage to make a great first impression on everyone in Mike and Dave's family, but it's not long before the girls' true (wild) colors begin to show. Mike and Dave realize that the girls need more straightening out than they do and, soon, the whole family ? and the whole wedding needs some serious straightening out. Some of the situations that arise include on ongoing gag about a relationship between one of the girls and the guys' lesbian cousin Terry (Alice Wetterlund), a masseuse (Kumail Nanjiani) who takes things too far, a dangerous ATV stunt, an unfortunate "live mic" moment, an awkward discussion of parental sexuality and an ill-timed first-time experimentation with "Ecstasy"."Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates" is the best wedding comedy in more than a decade, but does take things a bit too far. The four leads are familiar enough with each other to have good chemistry and they're clearly having fun, which goes a long way to ensuring that Movie Fans have a good time. There's some overacting, but it is entertaining to see Kendrick, who is known mainly for intelligent, charming, confident characters, play the exact opposite of those characteristics. Efron and DeVine might have been better off switching roles, but they did well, with the help of Plaza effectively playing her now familiar carefree/shame-free character, along with scene-stealing turns from Wetterlund and Nanjiani.This movie calls forward the spirit of the series of memorable wedding comedies from the first five years of this century (i.e., "Meet the Parents", "My Big Fat Greek Wedding" and "Wedding Crashers"), but goes further than any of them. Some of the situations and gags from those movies reappear ? as if on drugs (which, in some cases, they are). The film's advertising doesn't hide its raunchiness, but it might make even the most open-minded viewers uncomfortable at times, such as with a "Scarface" reference and one other scene, both with incestuous undertones. However, if you can take it, much of the movie is very funny and first-time feature director Jake Szymanski keeps the plot moving and the wild moments coming. "Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates" is an entertaining, boundary-pushing entry into the wedding comedy sub-genre. "B+"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's Totally Gross</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went to this movie with my daughter and 13 year old granddaughter. This movie was rated as a comedy. From the start the foul language never stopped. We were appalled. The sexual situations left nothing to the imagination. Showing a lesbian type of sexual situation was totally inappropriate and not necessary. The full frontal nudity of one of the girls was uncalled for. It was a waste of our time and money. Actually, we want a refund!!! Had we known in advance how gross and foul this picture was we never would have purchased tickets for this movie. The trailers didn't indicate the foul language that shortly followed. Unfortunately I watched the trailers AFTER seeing the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Screw the critics!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you want to see what real people really think of this movie just search "Mike and Dave" on Twitter- what you'll see is everyone raving about how they haven't laughed that hard in the theater in years. This movie makes its audience belly laugh for a solid 98 minutes. Don't listen to these critics- go see for yourself. I bet you, like everyone in the two theaters I have already seen this in, will laugh your butt off. With all the depressing news of the real world, its nice to have some comical relief. A funny enough summer comedy that never quite breaks free from the countless raunchy iterations that have come before it. Good natured yet deliriously dirty (and somehow based on a true story), Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates is probably the only good thing to ever come of Craigslist. It may not be Oscar worthy, but its enjoyable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fox MegaCorp believes that Real Life . . .</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>. . . should be like a grown-up version of Disney World, MIKE AND DAVE informs us. That's why it casts an aging version of that HIGH SCHOOL MUSICAL guy in its Lake Woebegone rendering of America. Whether you're talking Fox "News" or a Fox flick, all the Minorities are Polychromatic but Housebroken, all the White People are Wild but Harmless, and all the Incomes are Waaaay Above Average. It's a given that REAL "Real Life" will never rear its ugly head on Fox "News" or in a Fox Big Screen offering. If three million American mass shooters (the actual number of PTSD, suicidal, and\or diagnosed paranoid schizophrenics in the U.S. Today who ALREADY own Bushmasters!) each "take out" 100 normal people, Fox Talking Heads will reassure the shooters (the ONLY Americans left alive) that "Guns don't kill people." Similarly, the Zacs and Annas of MIKE AND DAVE may set off more explosions at a wedding reception than the hijackers produced on 9-11, but none of the Fox Pretties will suffer a scratch, because actions have no consequences among the Rainbows and Unicorns of Fox World.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Of course nudes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are some nudes. Some funny moment using nudes. Mostly you will see sexual humors in this movie and only those who understand those humors will like this movie.If you found out about this movie and doesn't think if I should bring kids or not to see this then don't do it. Don't bring in kids since there are *HUGE* amount of scene that isn't for kids to watch.I up vote this because of many understanding humors.Don't watch this video on the theater when people keep on laughing behind you since I hate that. Hard to hear what the joke was but I watch this twice so I can hear it. Many painful jokes that sound wrong but at the same time funny</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mike and Dave Need Weeding Dates (2016): Dir: Jake Szymanski / Cast: Zac Efron, Adam DeVine, Anna Kendrick, Aubrey Plaza, Stephanie Beard: Juvenile comedy about the need to grow up as brothers Mike and Dave Stangle learn when their parents have a meeting that ends with them finding dates for their sister's wedding. They stress "nice girls" but they end up hooking up with female versions of themselves. Mike and Dave have the reputation of raising havoc at family events. Alice and Tatiana are doped up versions who go along with the invitation in order to gain a free vacation. Predictably all havoc breaks loose again but it mainly lies with the females while the brothers are blamed. While the concept is fun the payoff never gives us Rihanna as it seemed to hint at. Zac Efron plays Dave who desires to aim his ideas through drawing. Adam DeVine as Mike witnesses some of the havoc and is distraught at behaviour that surpasses even his. They are upstaged by their female co-stars. Anna Kendrick as Alice is crushed over memories of being stood up at her wedding and responds by getting stoned often. Aubrey Plaza poses as a school teacher who will obviously stoop to any level to gain tickets to a Rihanna concert. Stephanie Beard has a blast as sister and bride Jeanie who is drugged by Alice and has an orgasmic time at a massage parlor that leaves her with the most joyously bizarre facial expressions. While the message may regard maturity, what viewers are really left with is the reality that females are just as outrageous as the males when it comes to wrecking a perfectly fine wedding. Score: 7 / 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's not their sex-crazed ambitions that lead to ruination, but simply their outrageous unintelligence.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Perhaps going further than any other film to pointlessly emphasize its grounding in reality, "Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates" claims to be "based on real events." The problem here is that nothing about the end result seems to exist in any sort of reality - not a raunchy comedy realm, an exaggerated boy-meets-girl romance, or even a misfits-gaining-popularity environment, much less real life. It's almost like a cartoon in the way that slapstick occurrences turn from deadly to irrelevant in a matter of minutes (one of the characters has half her face practically torn off by an ATV tire, only to be nearly healed about a day later), or in the way people become disgusted by extreme recklessness and then immediately celebratory; serious predicaments are devised for familial conflict, only to be laughed away by some random, crude gag. And the premise is less convincing than those seen in "Mrs. Doubtfire" or "Big Momma's House," even though no one actually dresses up.The introduction is one big college party montage, which segues into the plot with remarkable speed. Two liquor salesmen brothers (Zac Efron as Dave, and Adam Devine as Mike) have a knack for destroying every family gathering - not to be blamed on their inexcusable mindlessness or daredevilry, but on the fact that they show up stag, which somehow forces them to chase girls and cause destruction (usually of the property kind). As if somehow more believable in its modernity, their parents (Stephen Root and Stephanie Faracy) provide them with proof: a cut together, fully edited video of their detonative shenanigans and the ensuing havoc - one instance of which leads to the death of their grandfather. A quick joke later and the setup is complete: sister Jeanie's (Sugar Lyn Beard) upcoming destination wedding in Hawaii will require that the two boys bring dates.It's unimaginable to think that the brothers' last-minute acquisition of female partners from Craigslist (they place an ad that goes viral, giving them some 6000 responses and a guest appearance on The Wendy Williams Show) would prevent them from making a catastrophe of the wedding. It's not their sex-crazed ambitions that lead to ruination, but simply their outrageous unintelligence. Like the duo from "Dumb and Dumber," Mike and Dave can't really function in normal society. So, of course, they meet their female counterparts, Alice (Anna Kendrick) and Tatiana (Aubrey Plaza), who similarly have a difficult time of blending in with other human beings (until the end, when, after instigating much upheaval, they fix everything and fall in love). Self-absorbed and oblivious to the outside world, as if permanently inebriated (surprisingly, they're not continually drunk, despite nonstop drinking), these personas move through each scene with a single purpose: to prattle nonstop about graphic sexual items.The dialogue is clearly meant to be the selling point, with the primary foursome exchanging plenty of insults and commentary laced with cursing and sex-related riffs. But it's part of the problem. Never do their conversations sound funny or even creative; it's just a lot of innuendo, double entendres, and impromptu dancing - as if making faces and spontaneously shimmying in place can effectively take the place of solid jokes. The end product is quite a bit like "Couples Retreat" but for teens, with its tropical setting and opportunities for oneupmanship, misadventures, and revelations. But there's no consistency anywhere in the picture - whether its with physics, behaviors, comedy styles, or even nudity - which makes the the poignancy of realizations completely phony and the exposing of enormous lies entirely inconsequential. At least the outtakes are amusing.- The Massie Twins</fullReview>
