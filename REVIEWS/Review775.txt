		<shortDescription>Fine Australian drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Following the rape and murder of a colonial family, outlaw brothers Charlie and Mikey burns are captured by ruthless local lawman, Captain Stanley. Rather than imprison both fugitives, Stanley presents Charlie with a proposition (though it's really a demand) that Charlie kill his older brother, and gang leader, Arthur or else Mikey will meet his demise at the end of a hangman's noose. It is a proposition which will have karmic repercussions for all involved.Directed by Brisbanite John Hillcoate from a script by Aussie indie icon Nick Cave, this film has some of the most gorgeous photography of the Australian outback ever committed to film, showcasing it's unique desolate beauty in it's dust, flies and exquisite sunsets.Hillcoate assembles a very fine ensemble cast, most notably Ray Winstone as Captain Stanley and Guy Pearce as Charlie Burns - two actors performing at the top of their game. Danny Huston is effective as Arthur Burns, a man whose serene exterior belies his vicious temperament. Other performers include Emily Watson and John Hurt, as well as fine Australian talent David Wenham, Leah Purcell, Tommy Lewis and quintessential movie aborigine David Gulpilil. All performances are excellent.Despite it's high violence quotient, the film has an admirable lack of moralistic tone. There are no obvious good guys and bad guys, all the characters are shades of grey possessing both positive and negative attributes, although some characters may lean one way or the other. In particular, Captain Stanley has a good heart though history may judge his methods of justice with contempt, and Charlie Burns has a fierce sense of loyalty and honour but his associated family ties have led him to commit horrific crimes. Even Captain Stanley's wife, Martha, in all her Victorian innocence and naivety, has a dark side to her soul; an attribute which will further propel all towards their destinies.It's strong subtext of white colonialists' condescending treatment of the aboriginal population puts this film in fine company with other Australian indigenous-themed films such as Fred Schepisi's The Chant Of Jimmy Blacksmith, Nicholas Roeg's Walkabout, Rolf de Heer's The Tracker and Phillip Noyce's Rabbit Proof Fence. The Proposition is the best of these. This is a big call, I know, but the fact is that none of those other very fine Australian films possess the tension which so completely permeates Hillcoates' picture. This film represents a major achievement for both Hillcoate and Cave and is the best Australian film to leave these shores since Ray Lawrence's Lantana.8.5 out of 10.Slick. :cool:</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just superb - wonderful, austere direction that gets the best from a great cast and some extraordinary landscapes. A tight, disciplined script from Nick Cave that's testament to how his writing continues to reach new levels - not to mention his collaboration with Warren Ellis on the beautifully uneasy score. There's a fantastic blend of European and Australian sensibilities here that makes this the least clichéd film to come out of this country for 20-odd years - and if it doesn't do well, it'll be because an increasingly soft and gutless nation is afraid to venture out of their frappuccino and mortgage comfort zone. This is powerful, worthy art.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A real treat of a Western - gritty, bloody, unjust &amp; riddled with flies. An apocalyptic glimpse of some hard family lessons from Nick Cave. Brilliant performances all round thanks to Ray Winstone, Emily Watson &amp; Guy Pearce in particular. Visually stunning due to the location (anyone with the ability to remove a lens cap or activate a camera would capture something beautiful in that wonderful country Australia! But these scenes just envelope you and burn into your brain - in a good way). Tempting to add more to this scant comment box but it might just take something away from your viewing pleasure. And that would be a travesty because this is definitely a film to go in "fresh" to.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Aussie Western makes Tombstone look like Paradise.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nick Cave's essay in the true and tried Western format, shows how a harsh land (Colonial Australia) brutalizes the men who try and conquer it. Yet this tale has passages of lyricism that counterpoint the sudden moments of savagery. It is a very gritty often grisly picture of 19th Century Australia, warts and all, right down to swarms of blowflies. Perhaps the sadistic violence gets a bit over the top especially towards the end, but thanks to a fine cast, crisp direction, and the scorched cinematography it generally works. A standout performance in a minor role by John Hurt rather steals the show, while Ray Winstone and Emily Watson are particularly sensitive together. One suspects the harsh conditions are somewhat overstated for dramatic purposes, though the story is supposedly based on fact. Tombstone Territory never looked as unpleasant as this. It is certainly one of the most interesting period dramas made in Australia.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why is everyone so focused on the gore &amp; blood?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't enjoy violence in movies, especially if it's unnecessary. But this movie was justified in its use. Calling this movie very violent or bloody is misunderstanding the movie - it's taking the focus away from what matters in the movie: the landscape, the directing, the music, the characters as they are being acted out the story as it's unfolding. The violence connects you with the feelings and thoughts of the characters and conveys the the mood of the era - I came away feeling as if I had experienced living in "wild" Queensland. The story is simple but it's very well executed. And needless to say, I've learned from every single Guy Pearce movie I've seen. Ray Winstone was incredible, Emily Watson very effective, and John Hurt was a pleasurable bonus.The ending is poetic and beautifully done.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Visceral, poetic study of blood-ties</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is a visceral, violent study of blood-ties exploring ethnic and family bonds, feuds, loyalty and betrayal. You can literally smell the reeking sweat, blood and dust of the colonial Outback coming off the screen. Nick Cave's script is shot through with his signature dark poetry; it translates wonderfully onto the screen. Guy Pearce, Ray Winston and Danny Huston put in powerful performances. Emily Watson is also superb but somehow this film seems to be more about men than women and so her performance feels a little isolated from the rest of the movie. The film is a strangely skewed morality tale crossed with a tale of the absurd. There is something so absurd about Captain Stanley's English breakfast and standard roses in the hot, fly-blown wastelands of the movie, and off course there is something so absurd about how violent humans beings are to each other. Despite all the violence though, some of which is stomach-turning, this movie has some moments of great tenderness and elegy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Everyone connected with this film should be extremely proud of the movie they created. I will mention specifically: Delhomme for his extraordinary cinematography; Eden for her beautifully stark Set Decoration; Hillcoat for impeccable direction and especially John Hurt in a small but tremendously evocative early role.A staggeringly moving and uncompromising examination of contemporary emotions set against our early settlement history. The first thing I noticed about this film was the look of Guy Pearce's character's hair-dirty and stringy-something that Hollywood with it's pretensions and million-dollar babies would never allow. But these people looked bad, acted bad and I'm sure-smelt bad. In short, they were real people and they acted as real people in those monstrously uncompromising times would have acted.My friend said after viewing the film, that he didn't believe early Australia had the same frontier gun culture that is so often displayed in American films of the same genre. I too do not believe that our early settlement revolved around the gun mania of American settlement but I was not bothered by the gun culture shown in The Proposition. I kept looking for bits that did not play right and I could not find any-the film played real to me from beginning to end. Although extremely violent in those parts where violence was called for, this violence did not seem out of place or overdone. I have tried to know something of our early settlement history and what I saw fitted into that mental picture well. The unimaginable violence we displayed to the Aboriginal people was masked and not really a part of what occurred in this film so if some of that violence was shown towards white settlers then it seemed to blend in this film.An extraordinary film and I hope against hope that it will be eminently successful and therefore lead to the creation of other films based upon our early settlement history.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Put simply this is the best Australian movie I have seen for years. A so-called Australian Western this is uniquely Australian and a must see for both Australian audiences and international audiences who would have no idea what living in early 'civilised' Australia must have been like. Well acted with top internationally recognized talent (Pearce and Winstone are fantastic), beautiful landscapes, and a violent yet somewhat beautiful and (again) unique story, I hope this movie is seen well beyond the Art-house, and I hope there is adequate marketing because this movie is so much better than the run-of-the-mill stuff we usually see in the cinema.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The narrative may be weak but there is much to make up for it in this hauntingly beautiful and bleak film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Australia is a country in the throws of settlement by the English and lawlessness is rife. As the bloody clearing of aborigines continues, one gang's attack on a white family causes outrage. The pressure is on Captain Stanley to bring in the Burns gang, led by the sadistic and heartless Arthur. When Stanley's men capture the two younger brothers he strikes a deal with Charlie, the elder of the two. In nine days time, on Christmas Day, young Mike will hang unless Charlie has returned with his brother ? dead or alive.The plot summary and the advertising seemed to offer some form of thriller but in reality the film delivers something altogether more interesting and memorable. Set in the Australia outback where settlements are being born and laws being established, the film charts the moral complexities of the good and bad in the story while painting a beautifully bleak backdrop of open space and bloody, pointless violence. It is not an easy film to watch and certainly not one to expect to come out of laughing or feeling good about things. Nor is it a film to go into expecting a traditional plot because it is this area where the film is at its weakest because it is not a "this happened, this happened then that happened" sort of story. This is not to say it is boring but it does require patience for the casual viewer. Personally I found most scenes to be interesting but most admit that the narrative kind of hangs around rather than moving forward firmly in one direction.The substance is more in the characters than in the narrative and on this level it was engaging. Although the posters and summary will tell you this is about the Burns brothers, it is as much if not more about Stanley and his wife. It is he would has the duality of trying to defeat violence by encouraging it while also heaving under the burden of trying to take this job entirely on his own shoulders while protecting his wife from knowing anything about the real world out in the desert. It is an interesting thread and for my money it was the thrust of the story ? the issue of what Charlie will do is actually part of Stanley's story rather than the other way around. With this as the story the film is much better because it does paint a convincing tale around this. The Burns brothers thread is still interesting but less is done with it ? with Arthur himself being very little more than an enigmatic plot device.Style wise the film is fantastic as it delivers a bleakly convincing picture of the birth of Australia. The landscape is beautifully filmed and, although Cave could have done more as writer, his contribution to the soundtrack is as welcome as it is well used. The sudden moments of violence are uncomfortable and difficult to watch. They are delivered in visceral moments of gore that are bereft of any touches that would glamorise the death; here it is horrible and full of flies. Of course you are right to note that a hauntingly stylish delivery should not be taken as a replacement for substance but I think it has just about enough of the latter and an abundance of the former to carry the film as a whole.The cast are mixed but nobody really turns in a bad performance. Winstone dominates the film with easily the best performance and the most interesting character. His Captain Stanley wears every decision and Winstone allows us to see the effect this country has had on his soul. Watson is also good, simple at first but touched by the violence that her husband cannot defend her from. Pearce is an astute and subtle actor who keeps the audience with his thread even though it is less interesting; however Huston is not used as well as he deserved. He gives a memorable performance but his character is never more than an action waiting to happen. Wilson is convincingly young and his flogging is difficult to stomach, while Hurt turns up in a nice cameo as a bounty hunter. As much as the performances though, the film is about atmosphere, and Hillcoat has done a great job in producing a desolate film that is as beautiful as it is disheartening.An imperfect film due to the lack of a strong narrative, this is still a memorable affair for many reasons. It looks great, has a great use of music and produces a haunting desolation in the country and the characters. Not a fun night out by any means but for what it is, it is well worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very bloody Western too hard to swallow?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Set on an arid desert and sun-baked continent, during the late 1800's British settlement days, Pearce stars as Charlie Burns, one of three brothers that make up the notorious criminal Arthur Burns? At the opening credits Charlie and his younger brother the 14-year-old Mikey are captured after a bloody shoot out with regional Captain Stanley in the aftermath of a brutal rape and murder? The decent captain is after their eldest brother Arthur described as 'the beast,' and is prepared to do just about anything to get him...Thus Stanley lays out Charlie an unholy bargain: While Mikey stays in his custody, in jail, Charlie must find, kill or return Arthur or his teenaged brother will be hung on Christmas Day? He has nine days to do so? Charlie eventually finds his brother but is left with one choice? He must decide if he can live with his decision to either kill Arthur or let Mikey be executed? John Hillcoat's characters not only strike us with their emotions of grief and pain, or their passion of hate but they are presented in their real states that sway down hopelessness, denial, pity and firm belief? Pearce combines a touch of kindness to Charlie's character, but it's a touch that keeps out of the way any love? It's, in essence, only enough to add a decisive influence on his personality that makes him unpredictable? Danny Huston is magnificent as Arthur Burns? His deeply intelligence and totally brutal character is captured in a very good sense? Richard Wilson, Mikey is given little to do beyond being frightened and horrorized? Winstone is amazing in the role of the army officer who wants to civilize the place? We feel how his nerves are about to break? He imprisons his wife Martha for safety and protection caring at the same time about her delicate sensibilities? Emily Watson is absolutely stunning as the fragile woman whose gentleness captures convincingly the character of Emily, the innocent wife who cares about her husband, her house and her perfect "garden" but her way of life is so far away from the reality of her surroundings? John Hurt gives an interesting performance as the deranged bounty hunter? "The Proposition" is too violent, too dirty, too bloody, and too barbaric to be forgotten so easily?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Different Kind Of 'Western'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wow, what a brutal "western." I put "western" in quotes because most people think of the western half of the United States as being the locale for western movies. This movie was made and set in Australia but the time frame is similar: around 1880. What's "brutal" about the story is the violence, bloodshed and language - but only in spots. The language is odd in that the vocabulary of most of the people is above-average, but be warned there are a number of f-words. I question whether that word was around in the 19th century, but it's prevalent in this film. Actually, the violent scenes will be more offensive to viewers than the profanity. Like the profanity, however, the violence only comes in spurts. Most of the film has much calmer moments, surprisingly low-key.One thing that is there throughout the 104 minutes is the excellent cinematography. This is a pretty film, nicely shot with some beautiful scenery and colors, stylish at times, too. To me, this was the best part of the movie. It's indeed a visual treat. Benoit Delholmme deservedly won several international awards for his camera-work in here.The story is uniquely presented, different enough that it kept me very involved wondering what was coming next. For those expecting a brainless revenge story or shoot 'em up western, they will be disappointed. There is a lot of thought to this film, and it varies scene- to-scene from classy to crude.Guy Pearce, Ray Winstone and Emily Watson are three actors I am familiar with, and I enjoyed all three of their performances. This is not a well-known movie here in the States, but if you like tough westerns and something a bit different, check it out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>For pure realism, no Western can compare!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After watching this film, I would argue that no other Western has conveyed the loneliness or natural setting that this one has. Nor has any other Western shown its outlaws and lawmen in such an impartial or objective light as this one has. And considering the company of films this would include, 'The Unforgiven' being at the top, also 'The Outlaw Josey Wales', 'The Good, the bad, and the ugly', 'A Fistful of Dollars' and such, that is saying a lot. Many people on this site talk about the violence. Well, they are right. It is VERY real. However, it is not glorified in any way. And that is the key. The violence is justified. There is one common theme in all Western films: violence. America and Australia are unique in this way; although different, historically and culturally, they both had very violent settlements. This was mainly due to the vast geography, the climate, the harsh conditions, and the clashing of its inhabitants. So violence was the result of this mix. But don't be put off by this. There is much more going on in this movie than just violence.Whether it is the loneliness - the raw, beautiful, unforgiving nature of the Outback, or the question of class, race, mortality or family, we as an audience are privy to what it was probably like in the mid to late 1800's Australia. We are shown various groups involved; the aboriginals, the Irish, and the English to name a few. After watching this film, I simply want to know more. For that I give it a 10. Period.In addition to that. The acting is sublime. The direction and the cinematography are tops. The musical score cannot be more suitable. And the writing is supreme.Pound for pound, the best Western I've ever seen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So I just got back from The Proposition, an extremely upsetting and visually arresting Australian western written by Nick Cave and directed by John Hillcoat. The cast was amazing: Guy Pearce, John Hurt, Danny Huston, and above and beyond all, the stunning Ray Winstone and the always perfect Emily Watson...The film was brutal, violent and like nothing I had seen before. When I say it was violent, I can't stress enough how violent it actually was. There were some stomach turning moments where I had to actually avert my eyes...and I have a pretty high tolerance for that sort of thing. The thing about the excessive violence, though, is that it is completely appropriate for the story, set, I believe in the 1800s, in desolate Australia.The plot is a simple, classic genre plot: a band of outlaw brothers rape and pillage a good Christian family and then comes the more complicated revenge, loyalty and morality drama that will blow you away. Winstone's man of the law gives Pearce's criminal a proposition: bring home his third brother, responsible for a hideous crime, or he will kill his weak younger brother. The mythological overtones are perfectly done as are the inferences to Conrad's Hearts of Darkness. Huston's character is like a version of Kurtz. The characters are all ambiguous in their motives and every actor is game for the challenge...Also of note are the indigenous people of Australia, who the director says contributed to some of the script. There is black on black violence, there are members of the tribes working with the white men on both the outlaw's side and the legal. All of the native people are wonderful in their parts, proving again that stereotypes are not to be believed...Winstone plays the chief police man assigned to catch the gang responsible for killing a family who his wife, Watson, was friendly with. The gravitas and depth that Winstone conjures for this lawman who sometimes crosses the line is a wonder to watch, his character's arc is the most impressive. Watson, what more can I say about this actress?! I have loved her since Breaking the Waves and she is able to turn a "wife" role into something beyond any other actress' reach, a true original. She looks right at home in the period setting. Hurt, too, gives a master class in character acting as a bounty hunter...The look of this film is stunning, just unbelievable. The director uses the landscapes and the colors of nature to paint a story of their own. Not in the way say, Terence Malick does and not in the way that compromises the integrity of the land. The land becomes the sets and seems perfectly natural and not at all contrived...the costumes and art direction too are really top notch...Hillcoat was on hand to answer questions and talk about the film as well, which was cool. my boyfriend asked him a question about a disclaimer at the beginning of the film warning indigenous people that images of the dead were used throughout the film and he gave a great response about the cooperation of some of the Aborginal people and the opposition of others. He credited them with helping tell a story that hasn't yet been told in our time. He was very well-spoken and obviously knew the importance of handling the film's subject matter with compassion to all involved...Cave's music score was also very effective and contributed to the tense, sweaty, fly-laden atmosphere of the dirty film.I highly recommend this film to anyone...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Strange And Violent Western Set In The Outback</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Captain Stanley captures two notorious outlaw brothers Charlie and Mickey Burns . He makes a proposal to Charlie . If Charlie goes and kills the leader of their gang Arthur Burns and brings his body back they will be given an amnesty . If not Mickey will be hung on Christmas day which is nine days away You always know what you're going to get with a film by Australian director John Hillcoat namely strong memorable drama that's best viewed with a ready supply of anti-depressants . You also know what you're not going to get , laughs , mirth and a strong narrative drive . Certainly both GHOSTS OF THE CIVIL DEAD and THE ROAD suffered slightly from a lack of a strong narrative drive and in this British produced pseudo Western set in 19th Century Australia there's also a sign of this flaw from the director The premise is one that grabs you and leads you to ask what you would do in that situation but as soon as Charlie leaves town on his quest the story meanders slightly as we're shown lots of panoramas of the Australian outback with a vague mystical air which will remind you of Australian cinema of the 1970s where the landscapes were the stars of the movie . One also gets the feeling in the first third that you're might be watching an Aussie version of APOCALYPSE NOW where a man with a mission involving extreme prejudice finds his target building an empire amongst the natives This doesn't happen thankfully and after a slightly unfocused first 40 minutes the story gets back on track with characterisation coming to the fore . THE PROPOSITION is much more character driven than the premise promises . There is a slight cop out in that Mickey is the poor unintelligent younger brother who has merely tagged along with the gang through family peer pressure and while Arthur isn't portrayed by Danny Huston as a stock psychotic villain with staring eyes and manic laugh his actions do more than enough to convince the audience that this rabid criminal dog needs to be put out of his misery . The characterisation between the good younger brother and the violent bad older brother could been written and developed as a bit more grey but there again it might have made it more difficult to cheer on Charlie the middle brother played by Guy Pearce The cast are excellent and special mention goes to Ray Winstone who is a national institution in Britain and watching him here you're aware of how underrated he is and gives a depth to Captain Stanley a man tormented by trying to uphold the law without giving in to rough justice from the locals . It's perhaps difficult to believe a rough working class bloke would be married to Emily Watson's rather middle class Martha but Watson does manage to project an innocence that seems out of place but that's undoubtedly the point . One character that did puzzle me was Jellon Lamb . John Hurt of course steals the show every scene he appears in but is there any point to the character except to spout Darwin ? it's a slightly confused and unnecessary character And THE PROPOSITION is a slightly confused film that stops it from attaining true classic status . It's a bleak nihilistic character study from John Hillcoat and contains all the strengths and weaknesses from the director's prior and future work . That said it's much better than most of the films the UK Film Council insist on wasting their money on from the same period</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Admirable clarity, not a little poetry</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This Aussie Western, scripted by Nick Cave, written by John Hillcoat, presents its mythical story with admirable clarity and not a little poetry.For mine, it was too slow in parts, but it is a worthy work of sharp imagination that uses its setting as character and boasts several excellent performances -- in particular, Ray Windstone and Danny Huston stamp their characters with solid authority.Though Guy Pierce is the film's focal point, I found his performance self-consciously laconic and further proof that he is best in strong supporting roles, not leads.Emily Watson brings a strapping presence to her turn as Winstone's independent wife and David Wenham has fun with the ultra-arch, almost ludicrous stuffed shirt Eden Fletcher.The film's violence, which is not coy, is more sudden than stylized and Frenchman Benoit Delhomme's cinematography emphasizes Australia's harsh glare and limitless landscapes.Hillcoat, working from Cave's spare blueprint, doesn't accessorize the drama too heavily or ruin the action with too much cutting.</fullReview>

It's characters show a splendid view of passion and connection between humans as well as egoism and ruthless self-interest devoid of humanity that makes this a powerful and modern horror reality film.It may not be fair to compare this with Peckinpah's westerns because Peckinpah's were certainly ahead of their time with realism and complexity but The Proposition is so much more sophisticated in the best sense. It makes most American westerns look black and white...Few directors/writers are as compelling.

		<shortDescription>"Australia? what fresh hell is this?" ?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Late nineteenth century Australia seems to have been quite a hellish place indeed if we are to believe what Nick Cave and John Hillcoat have given us here. From the unflinching, seeming authenticity, the weight of conflicting emotion on the part of each and every human being portrayed, and the sheer beauty of it?pain, suffering, and all?I won't be the one to dispute it.I must admit that I have never seen a western before. The closest I have come is the first two seasons of the magnificent "Deadwood" on HBO. If The Proposition is any indication of what I am missing, sign me up for a marathon now. Nick Cave has scripted a haunting ballad of a time left behind. Like his music with the Bad Seeds, the film is both brutal and lyrical at alternating and overlapping instances, yet if there is one thing that runs throughout, it's honesty. This is the Australian outback at its' hottest and most dangerous. Flies scurry across frame every second of the way, touching down on the sweat-soaked flesh of the people invading their space. Give credit to the actors, this isn't a Hollywood film, the swarms are plenty and there is never a flinch or notice, even when one lands on a lip or eye. They are also real people and not clichés. When one character, fast asleep in his bedroom with pistol at close proximity, is awoken by a gunshot, he doesn't rise with gun ready for action. Instead he jumps up, hand on gun, and goes full speed into the closed door, falling to the floor. This jolt knocks the lingering sleep from his head and he turns to tell his wife to stay put before opening the door and leaving. There is no humor in the scene, just the reality of fear quickening one's actions to a higher speed than his lucidity.As for the story, the Irish Burns brothers have been wreaking havoc in the outback. The three and their cohorts ride through towns partaking in murder and rape without a second thought, until one instance wakes Charlie to discover the nightmare he is in. Charlie, played to stoic perfection by Guy Pearce, takes his younger brother away from the carnage only to be soon found by local British authorities, led by Captain Stanley (Ray Winstone). A proposition is then struck that Charlie has nine days until Christmas, nine days to find his brother Arthur, (Danny Huston), to kill him and end the hellish trail of death he leaves in order to save his younger sibling from the noose. Charlie agrees as he has taken his brother out of the life to save him; he must do what he can to keep that dream alive. The journey begins: a quest for redemption, for penance, or maybe to join Arthur again and lead a charge for rescue.Flanking Pearce, (his Till Human Voices Wake Us has been on my to see list for almost 5 years now, if anyone has seen it please let me know how it is), are two amazing performances by Winstone and Huston; both wear their emotions on their sleeves. Huston is an intelligent, educated, yet sadistic man. He does whatever he needs to and at night stares out into the distance, a look of wildness etching the contours of his face. Is he thinking about his deeds with an anger keeping him awake at night or about what atrocities he will commit tomorrow? One compatriot asks later in the film if they are misanthropes, if they hate humanity? Huston's answer is "Lord no, we're family." Caring for his own blood is all the humanity he needs. Winstone's captain is the opposite. He is a just man, trying to civilize a wild country. Trying to balance the cold stare needed to accept the violence he inflicts with the compassion necessary to hide it when confronting his wife is heartwrenching. Every emotion is flashing behind his eyes, sometimes he must do what is right, and not "just", and others he must do what is necessary for the overall good.The supporting roles are also superb as John Hurt supplies a nice turn as a bounty hunter out looking for the Burns clan and Emily Watson is unforgettable as the captain's wife. Her character is on the fringe of all the happenings going on, but when she slowly finds herself discovering the truth, her performance really shines. A gorgeous example is a scene where she is describing a dream to her husband, the camera-work is magical?as it is throughout the movie?and the composition of shots lend the tale even more emotion by shielding us from her face as she recites.This film cannot be critiqued without mention of the haunting score by Cave and Warren Ellis. Music enhances each scene it is used in. Gorgeous strings and piano mixed with hard, driving guitar create mood and tension. Even the use of traditional Celtic melody works perfectly. The juxtaposition of Peggy Gordon with the visuals it is overlaid on is stirring. Nick Cave has bridged his dark storytelling from albums like Murder Ballads and Let Love In seamlessly to the big screen. Our emotions are amped up as we journey through the roller-coaster ride of feelings. If you have seen Wim Wenders' poetic Wings of Desire and remember the two scenes in the music clubs where the angel first meets his love and next seeks her out in human form, all to driving rock beats, you will know what I mean by music creating a powerful hold. You will also know then that the second band used is Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds. His music has had a strong grip for almost two decades in cinema.Who knew dirt, sweat, graphic violence, and a palpable humidity on screen could be so breathtaking a sight to see.</fullReview>

I am happy to be blessed with the opportunity to see this movie. Where I currently live gets a lack of films which really disappoints me. It was pleasantly surprising to see that this was showing, sadly though I was one of two people in the theaters. The lack of people who like good films or at least try new films makes it hard for these types of films to be made. Please support great gems like the Proposition.Sincerely,Chris</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Aussie Heart of Darkness</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An inspired Hillcoat-Cave collaboration that will repulse and attract audiences in equal measure, The Proposition is a lyrical, enigmatic but brutal examination of the human condition set in early settler Australia. Hillcoat's stark framing and unflinching portrayal of violence is perfectly blended with Cave's multi-dimensional characters, and atmospheric soundtrack.Captain Stanley goes after the murderous Burns brothers by setting them against each other. His proposition is that middle brother Charlie kill older brother Arthur, in order to save younger brother Mike from the noose. It is expedient justice but also astute psychology on Stanley's part; Charlie seems less than reluctant to take on the task of dispensing with his charismatic but psychotic older sibling.Stanley's mantra is that he will civilize this land, but his failing is in choosing the wrong target. His treacherous sergeant, feeble superior, and uptight wife together conspire through ignorance and fear to undo the Captain's intent. When Mike is flogged beyond reason and physical endurance, the Captain's moral argument is won, but perhaps at the price of all their lives, as the Burns brothers come seeking vengeance.Pearce adds impressively to his CV, in an understated but powerful performance as the brooding middle brother. Stanley is not exactly a good guy, but as much on the side of good as it is possible to be in this God-forsaken landscape. It has taken a while to get used to Winstone in such roles, starting with Sexy beast, but he is wearing them with aplomb now. Danny Huston is a pleasant surprise as the educated but deranged Arthur, while John Hurt revels in playing against type. Emily Watson, never less than excellent, embodies the prim Victorian. My own first impression of Australia was flies, flies, flies, and Hillcoat captures this. The question is not why there are so many flies in this film, but why they are curiously absent from other Australian films. They are both a metaphor for the squalor and decay that infest existence, and an acutely observed detail of the arena.Before the British, other Europeans famously arrived in Australia but considered the landscape uninhabitable. Threaded through The Proposition is the suggestion that they were right.The broader reference is the existence of our dark side, embodied in Arthur, a Kurtz-like figure, a god-like presence in an inhospitable landscape, facing an assassin dispatched from a 'civilization' that does not like what he reminds them of. The film references Conrad's infamous tale but anchors it in this universal tale of white men's ill-fated attempts to conquer a land where they do not belong. The aborigines tolerate them, or despair of them. "Strange, you whities" says Jacko, while house servant Tobey shows his role as subservient ends at the garden gate, where he leaves his boots and returns to his barefoot roots. Two Bob simply abandons his white mates at the end. Like the land, their attitudes to these invaders range from indifferent to hostile.The Proposition is less poetic violence than violent poetry. Too much to take in here in one viewing, in time to come this might just match Walkabout as the masterpiece of Australia-set cinema.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One rough Western . . .</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an Australian film, and an Australian Western at that. It didn't get a lot of press or a lot of play, and I didn't even get to see it until I rented it one day - from the library! It is so well done as a film, and I believe probably one of the best Westerns ever made. Coming from a life long John Wayne fan, that's a lot to say. But it is so rough and gritty and hard - even the violence is hard. And it is violent. Though none of it is gratuitous, with all of it in context, and very believable. Realism is one of the film styles I am drawn to, and this is definitely that. It lacks all of the polish of Tombstone, which is a great Hollywood western. In fact, it is the complete opposite. I think only Unforgiven reaches some of the rawness here, and I say some. There is one scene of vengeance that is even a bit much for me, and pushes it almost to the edge of watchability. But just the one. The cast is excellent, with outstanding performances by all, most notably Ray Winstone as the chief good guy and John Huston's boy Danny as the chief bad guy. Danny Huston's performance is very understated, which I think right for the character. This is one of the few films in my collection that I would say is not for everybody, perhaps only for the adventurous. I say that as a conservative. as I look at the morality in anything I see - and will gladly walk out of a film if they're preaching the wrong message. If you can get past the hardness, it is almost a haunting film, even a little mystical. It stays with you for days.fullgrownministry.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Violence as an art form.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Proposition (2005) **** There is a brooding sense of despair and dread in The Proposition, that is found in few other films. This is a violent film, but no more violent than your average run of the mill slasher flick. The difference is in the atmosphere that Hillcoat and Cave create out of the grime, the dirt, racism and desperation of the 19th Century Austrailian outback. That difference transcends the violence from shocking to downright gut-wrenching.Ray Winstone, as the local authority, captures two members of the brotherly Burns gang, Charlie and Mikey. Mikey is apparently mentally handicapped, and as Winstone points out, not able to comprehend his crimes, and is as such, essentially innocent. Charlie is offered a proposition - save his beloved younger brother, Mikey, from the noose, by killing his murderous and sadistic older brother, Arthur. This proposition is offered in the first 5 minutes of the film, and sets the pace for the remainder. Charlie is faced with this morally ambiguous task of which brother must live, and which must die. The final sequence of the film, taking place during a Christmas dinner, is incredibly powerful and terrifying alike.This is not an easy film to watch: its dark, its violent, and its a moral puzzle. The film does not glorify its violence, it abhors it and so do we. It shows us men who are essentially good, doing bad things, and men who are inherently bad doing even worse things. Eventually even bad men must draw a line in the sand, and the film transcends the blood line of brothers and seeks to find the answer to how much is enough.Very dark and intensely violent in its mood and structure, The Proposition is a artistic take on violence thats either hard to watch, or hard to look away from.4/4</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Enthralling, but less than the sum of its parts</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Proposition has the kind of premise that Anthony Mann would have loved ? wild colonial boy Guy Pearce is released into the outback to kill his psychotic older brother Danny Huston to save his younger brother from the noose by Ray Winstone's policeman determined to civilize his godforsaken corner of 19th century Australia. Unfortunately it never quite makes enough of it. Coming to it after both the excessive praise and the equally excessive backlash I wasn't disappointed, although the film does have problems. The most obvious is that screenwriter Nick Cave and director John Hillcoat become so enamoured of Winstone's character that he dominates the film to the detriment of not only the other players but the film itself: while there's none of his scenes that should be cut, neither Pearce nor Huston get nearly as much screen time. As a result, the central moral dilemma is kept firmly backstage and Huston's nature is only really hinted at rather than explored, although the violence, when it comes, is convincingly blunt. It's a film with great things going for it ? there's some fine dialogue, Hillcoat has a great visual sense and a striking eye for the Scope frame, while an underplayed Winstone is superb - but one that never becomes great.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I awaited this film for quite some time (not having a theater in my hometown there was no plausible way of me seeing this film and this fact combined with the films stupidly limited releases forced me into using other means to view it). I'll admit right away that I over-hyped the film for a long time before I finally saw it (Guy Pearce being a favorite actor and dark Westerns being a favorite genre) which is usually a principal ingredient in the recipe for disaster.The Proposition is a brilliant, beautiful and very poetic film (the juxtaposition of the harsh, ugliness of humanity and the beauty of language and nature is especially chilling in many scenes and adds everything to the shared humanity element making this film so powerful).I'm not going to go into too much in fear or spoiling something in the plot, but do NOT LET YOURSELF MISS THIS FILM. I've been very interested in checking out Nick Cave's fiction for some time and I think this film will finally inspire me to do so.One of the best Westerns released during my lifetime.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gritty History</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The best part about The Proposition is that it is a glimpse of Australian history that few of us know anything about. Screenwriter Nick Caves, who is primarily a composer, tells the fascinating the story of rival factions striving for control of the Australian outback in the 19th century. While we are never given dates, but director John Hillcoat said in the Sundance Q&amp;A that it roughly represents the second generation of imports, or children of the first convicts. The battle for supremacy is between the Irish and the British, with the aborigines tragically caught in-between.The Burns gang is Irish, led by the educated, perceptive and slightly psychopathic elder brother Arthur (Danny Huston). Brother Charlie (Guy Pearce) no longer rides with the gang, apparently sickened by their wanton cruelty. The movie starts with British soldiers ambushing Charlie and his apparently retarded and hyper-sensitive brother Mike (Richard Burns). They are seeking justice for the rape and killing of a local white family by Arthur and his gang. British Captain Stanley (Ray Winstone) captures Charlie and Mike and gives Charlie a proposition?find your brother Arthur and kill him or your beloved brother Mike will be hanged on Christmas Day.This is a gritty western that boldly strives for realism, complete with obscene and graphic violence, yellow teeth and nasty flies. (According to the cast at Sundance, the realism was intensified by filming entirely on location, sometimes in 130 degree temperatures with the flies as constant companions. "Everyone swallowed flies," said Hilcoat.) It deglamorizes the period in much the same way that Eastwood's Unforgiven did in 1992.Guy Pearce puts in a solid performance as the strong silent type made up of sinewy strength and moral fiber. Winstone is also terrific as the ethically conflicted British captain, who vows to civilize the land, but recognizes that savagery is not the solution. John Hurt turns in a fine little performance that's a lot of fun. But I was most impressed with Danny Huston (John Huston's son, Anjelica's brother and former husband to Virginia Madsen (Sideways). His character is rich and multi-dimensional and Huston plays it magnetically: educated and intelligent, lover of Australian sunsets, sensitive Irish patriot, leader of the family and sadistic executor of frontier justice. Even after stomping people to death and beheading others I still couldn't help feeling for the character.(I spoke to Huston after the performance and asked him if it wasn't unsettling being caked in blood and gore and playing such a ruthless character. He said it was a lot of fun. OK, so he goes to a different school than Daniel Day-Lewis. Anyway, I thought he carried the movie.) It would be hard for me to recommend this as entertainment. It was very slow-moving at times, relying on cinematography and landscape to keep your attention. And the blood and guts were way too much?I found myself closing my eyes in parts. But it does provide a rare glimpse of a part of history that Australians still grapple with to this day.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Frustrating</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is much that is really standout about this movie, so much so that I'll hesitantly recommend it. Still, this is a deeply flawed movie, and it's frustrating, because it could've/should've been so much better than it turned out to be.The good parts: it's utterly beautifully shot. In a fine year for cinematography in the movies this is some kind of high point, and is probably recommendable on that basis alone. (It demands to be seen on the big screen.) Production design is amazing -- you can smell the sweat and filth on these characters. The direction is remarkable all around, especially the framing of the shots. And it's impeccably acted up and down the line -- Ray Winstone in particular takes a very contrived character and makes him human and believable. It's a remarkable performance, in it's way, and I'd love to see him get an Oscar nomination for it.The script is the big problem. It's very weak -- the plot makes no sense, the moments of Solemnity are pompous and cheesily pretentious, and many of these characters don't "exist" so much as they are poetic conceptions, stand-ins for ideas about violence. The movie is predictable in it's twists and very difficult to take seriously -- which is what it so obviously wants to be.Very reminiscent to my mind of A HISTORY OF VIOLENCE, another movie where bravura movie-making overwhelms a substandard script.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What an unexpected awesome movie. I didn't know any of the actors, save of course for John Hurt, but after seeing the rating it got on IMDb I wanted to see this film. I was absolutely thrilled that I did.The action starts immediately from the opening scene and grabs your attention. The characters are totally believable and the story doesn't take any time at all to start moving...and move it does. At no point was there a dull moment leaving time to start thinking about going for a snack or taking a washroom break. This movie kept me intensely watching with scene after scene of classic good guy's who are bad guy's and vice-versa. Several surprises are in store for those who like to figure out what's about to happen next. Through it all you really feel the discomfort people must surely have endured in the early settlement days, in the outbacks of Australia. An excellent Western that could easily be mistaken for an American film...but it's not.Hats off to the team that made this wonderful movie and I hope they make more just like it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great modern day western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Western seems to have gone out of fashion in recent years, which is a shame - so it's a good job that there are people like John Hillcoat out there who are willing to deliver films like this. The Proposition is a real old school western - gritty, violent and fleshed out by sophisticated and interesting characters. Director John Hillcoat succeeds in capturing the style of the classic westerns, and the fact that this film was written by Nick Cave means that it will be no surprise that there's a trippy, hallucinogenic feel to it also. The plot focuses on an impossible situation. After capturing Charlie and Mike; two of the notorious Burns brothers, Capt. Stanley decides not to hang them both - but to give the elder of the brothers, Charlie, a proposal. He and his brother will be given a full pardon if he can bring the eldest and most notorious of the Burns brothers, Arthur, to justice in nine days. Otherwise the youngest brother, Mike, gets the hangman's noose.One of the main reasons why The Proposition is so good is down to the fact that it's so well put together and everyone involved in the film is at their best. Guy Pearce very much looks the part in the lead role and holds the film together well. He gets great support from the likes of Ray Winstone, Danny Huston and Emily Watson. The fact that the film is brought to life by such a talented bunch of people really does it a lot of favours, as each actor ensures that the story gets across in a way that is always interesting. Many of the best westerns are violent and gritty, and this one is no different. While there aren't a great deal of gunfights and fistfights, the ones that do feature really make an impact. The film feels very realistic throughout, and this ensures that what happens is always credible and believable. It all boils down to a shocking and fittingly ambiguous climax that will generate as much thought from the audience as the film that precedes it. Overall, The Proposition is easily one of the best westerns made in recent years, and it's a damn good film in its own right too!</fullReview>

I was a bit surprised that a musical anachronism crept in, especially since this movie was sound tracked by my favorite musician on earth, Nick Cave, along with the redoubtable Warren Ellis.Please note one gaff: When Charley Burns (Guy Pearce) enters the shanty bar and meets John Hurt's character, Hurt sings a satirical version of the old Irish-American standard, "Danny Boy." This movie is set in the 1880s, but the song was written in 1910 by Frederick Weatherly, an English lawyer, and set to the tune of "Londonderry Air" in 1913.</fullReview>

No one wastes their ammunition either, and the feuds are based on real problems ...if'n you raise your gun, then you best plan to use it! Even days later, just thinking about scenes... I still can't believe how real these characters all seemed; their sets; their clothing; their equipment, everything ...everything, I swear that I went back in time! Wow! "Oscar-worthy" indeed! From the opening scene ...when Capt. Stanley hit that kid, I swear I could taste blood in my own mouth, and then all the dust, and the heat and those flies of that Australian outback, (which made our Old West in the U.S. seem like a kiddies' sandbox!) And who the hell are the good guys in this film, anyway!? No one is... I reckon. Nope. Life is tough. It really defies belief how anyone could survive. And I appreciate how the film portrayed some of the Aboriginal mystic perspective on things.Nick Cave took back the Western flick! No, he's done better than any western I've seen ...in recent memory... {{Sorry Sergio?!}} His movie is that gritty "Neo-realism", but with this band of Irish brothers. Convicts, I suppose, but I was really impressed how the idea of "moral superiority" kept shifting between all the characters. As motives and the film's plot are slowly revealed, it's interesting how the worst of this lot lives in a cave, like Osama bin Laden! Maybe in brutal environments, like these, some folk end-up relying so much on their own internal compass---more so than folk living safely in their civilized cities---that mountain dwellers lose the context of what is means to be human?? Then again, maybe there are reasons why some people are forced to lose their meaning, or belief in humanity?!? These brothers have made their own brand of integrity; not man-made laws, mind you, but this savage integrity that is based on the instincts of survival.Cave's story should give anyone pause to consider... politically, about what it means to live in a society and the idea of "civilization". Because these characters are most complex. Each has the capacity for good AND evil, yet all of them---in their own simple way--- just want to find some kind of safety and a little comfort ...please... from that brutal Australian environment, mate!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Nick Cave's script and the performances of Guy Pearce, Danny Houston and Ray Winstone render a vision as close to that of America's greatest living writer (comparable to Herman Melville), Cormac McCarthy: left unbridled, man will overthrow and destroy the moral forces of the universe. Against the backdrop of the Australian outback in the early days of the 20th century will man choose to civilize himself? That question is still the most pertinent one today. Winstone's "Everyman" Soldier risks his own life as well as that of his naively civilized wife, beautifully played by Emily Watson, to bring order, morality and an end to idolatry of the self. Guy Pearce struggles to choose between familial blood ties and simple human decency. Danny Houston employs the essence of his own sweetness to render a modern villain in the guise of the Lord's avenging angle. Rarely does a cinematic script achieve total ensemble realization from cast and crew. Bravo!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My cinematic gurus, I present you a proposition which I think you will undertake. There is this unorthodox , gripping film entitled (what else?) "The Proposition". What you would have to do is call a certain number 305-888-FILM. You will be a connected to a very abhorrent, deafening voice which will tell you a listing of films available for moviegoers to experience. Next, you would have to dial the letters "P-R-O" with your touch tone keypad. You will be a "pro" if you get this far. At this point you are in the selection process of "The Proposition". After, you would dial your zip code on your touch tone keypad. This will lead you to the extravagant cinematic establishment where they are exhibiting "The Proposition" near you. At the climactic point, you just have to "giddy up" to that cinematic establishment and purchase tickets for "The Proposition" and enter the murky theater room where they are playing "The Proposition". What do you get in return? You get to experience probably one of the supreme western films in history! I propose you the plot of "The Proposition". The film is set in the secluded Australian Outback of the late 1800's. Guy Pearce stars as Charlie Burns, the middle brother of a triad of outlaw siblings, whose ravish acts include: attacking the Hopkins farm, raping pregnant Mrs. Hopkins, and murdering the entire family. Yes! They do have a burning sensation to be bad boys. Charlie and his younger brother Mike are captured by the law enforcement head-honcho Captain Stanley and his henchmen. The eldest Arthur Burns lies in an isolated Australian Outback locality so he is not part of the seizure. Captain Stanley presents a proposition to Charlie. The prop is for him to capture and kill his older brother Arthur and in return he will spare his live and that of Mike also. Charlie Burns seemed to be burned out of the massacre business with Arthur so he accepts the proposition and goes on the journey while Mike stays back in a cell. What follows is a sensational film that depicts the egocentric iniquitous side of mankind. I say "shoot them up, way up" for the mesmerizing acting performances of "The Proposition". Pearce has not been this good since his unforgettable work in "Memento". Danny Huston was wickedly startling as Arthur Burns. Ray Winstone will get your acting vote as the conflicted Captain Stanley. In other words, Winstone definitely had the tools to hammer the Stanley character. I propose to the Academy to nominate these actors for their thespian efforts! It is a proposal I hope they will not refuse! John Hurt, Emily Watson, and David Wenham also do get my support for Oscar nominations for their outstanding thespian supporting performances. Director John Hillcoat's punctilious work should also be lauded come Oscar time. Nick Cave's profoundly painstaking screenplay deserved enough kudos for Nick to get out of his cave and walk the red carpet. Benoit Delhomme's breathtaking cinematography was worthy enough to call this "homme" a talented film technical artist. I propose that you go on your "marry" way to accept "The Proposition". ***** Excellent</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film (pure cinema) is not for the faint of heart. If you're a fan of Peckinpah (The Wild Bunch)or Leonne (The Good Bad and the Ugly, For a Few Dollars More), you'll love it. For the first time in a while I had left a theater and said "now that's how you make a movie." Ray Winestoen as Captain Stanley, amongst other stellar performances including Emily Watson, is the driving force in this movie. I am looking forward to seeing him team up with Cave and Hillcoat again in 2007.The leader of the Burns game, name escapes me, is reputed to be an "animal" and doesn't appear until mid-film much like Col. Kurtz. The premise is simple but it's the rich, understated nuances of the actors that is captivating. Any good western has urgency, like Will Kane in High Noon, brother sent to kill brother before younger brother is hung. There's also an amazing performance by the "guy in the bar" that returns to kill Guy Pierce. There is obviously an abundance of talent in Australia and the U.K.. "The Proposition" resuscitated my faith that the medium of film , at least outside of the US, and its directors are still committed to the art and not the box office. Who knows, in a few years Hollywood could corrupt him into directing a live action of the Jetson's or some Hollywood crap.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A work of art</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just read a review of this film in an esteemed British paper. All the reviewer could say was that it was too violent and tried to depict the awfulness and filth of the era too closely. WHAT? This film is a work of art. The writing is some of the best I have heard in a long while. The visuals are extraordinary, the editing is exquisitely musical ( I wonder why...Nick Cave has brought his musical talent here in full) and the acting brilliant. This is a very tight piece of work. I did not feel it was trying to be 'realistic' - whatever that means - but to create a film that pushes the envelope of the medium. It is beautiful work. In spite of the 'unpleasant' story and the blood, I felt uplifted - not only by the ending but by the pure poetry of the whole. I was amazed at the biographies of the writer and director. They should be inundated with work. With such crap out there (I had just seen Serenity, voted higher here on IMDb than this film), I hope we get to see many more movies by these two.I suspect this film appeals to a certain group of people, and Serenity to another. I would love to see votes sorted by age group and also by particular preferences, so it is easier to understand the rating system and not go and see a film that you don't like simply because it is rated at 8.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a morally crunching western that's probably one of the best of its kind from down under</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember reading some interview about The Wild Bunch where someone described how watching it almost made that person feel like he was "in the dust" with the characters up on screen. I mention this because I was reminded of it watching the Proposition, which made me feel, for lack of a better analogy, like I was right up in the flies in the film. There are, indeed, quite a few in the film, mostly by incident I would gather (in that climate many just constantly buzz around people's heads). But sometimes the imagery of some of these flies, combined with the violent, doomed nature of what was up on screen, was quite affecting. It also adds greatly to the wretched, harsh and immediate feeling of this film, where none of the actors are really good, though even the ones who are the villains are given more of a fully centered view than just cardboard cut-out bad-guys. When it is violent, it doesn't hold back, with the blood quite rash and the actions taken through it range from being startling to really disturbing.The cast is also uniformly good, which really helps off-set one or two liabilities that pop up in the film. Guy Pearce and Ray Winstone are on opposite ends of the spectrum as gang-member and sheriff, the latter of which offers the 'deal' of the title to Pearce to kill his fellow older brother in crime who committed a heinous act in turn for his and his younger brother's freedom. However things are not as easily done than said in this 19th century Australian hell of an outback as Aborigines still cover many a track in the deserts, and morality becomes eschewed with strong laws and big codes of the land. In maybe my favorite acting of the film, however in a 'hammy' way, is from John Hurt who has a small part but every moment of his screen time is put to good use to make some good points for the sake of the film and to also be another of the odd casualties who probably make up the background of the story. Emily Watson is also good, though in a tormented, frightened way as the Sheriff's wife.If maybe there are a couple of little things that might keep the film from the total greatness of the last superb one, Unforgiven, it's because it's already splendid esoteric feeling is compacted further with some elements. There are some voice-over bits, for example, primarily little bits with a whispering voice, and also some things in the music by the film's writer Nick Cave that here and there are irksome. Sometimes with a western the images can speak totally for themselves without extra poetic exposition. Not that there aren't some amazing images though of the wide rocky outback too, which only adds to the atmosphere. But The Proposition succeeds nonetheless in due to carrying out a very gritty, tragic vision that leaves nobody innocent in the end, and with more than a few lives and minds ruined. A particular lashing scene (where in I really got the 'flies' feeling) could also mark for me as one of the most vicious scenes in any western, almost on par with horror movies with their visceral need to rightfully shock.Surely not for traditional western tastes, and maybe closer to that original analogy of Peckinpah with its subversion of genre, The Proposition is one of the better 'foreign' films I've seen this year.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was one of those films that I was really looking forward to seeing and maybe I built up my hopes a bit too much as I ended up feeling disappointed.It is a slowly paced film aside from the very frantic opening and I was willing it to get a move on.The story centres around three brothers.One is held captive while another is told he must kill his elder brother in order to save the youngest.Eventually the elder brother is found and he is a psychotic rapist and murderer.Will his brother kill him or not?I won't spoil the plot by saying,but the outcome was kind of what I expected.The acting is fine with no duff performances,but I felt that several scenes between the captain and his wife(Ray Winstone and Emily Watson)slowed the film down and didn't fit into the context of the movie.This was especially relevant in the scene where she is sat in a bath tub talking about a baby.It just didn't seem to suit the situation to me and felt a bit forced,as though the movie was trying to change direction by showing a softer side.This is a movie that is most definitely a slow burner,but one that ultimately didn't quite hit the mark.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a keen music fan i was very intrigued by the proposition of watching a film scripted by Nick Cave. A quick glance down the cast list heightened my expectations with many of the actors/actresses having appeared in some of my favourite films; Guy Pearce - Memento, Emily Watson - Angela's Ashes, Ray Winstone - Sexy Beast and John Hurt - Alien.Centering around three criminal brothers and the lawman out to end their reign of terror, The proposition is an unsettling thriller set in the Australian outback. In a cruel twist of fate, Charlie Burns, played by Guy Pearce, is told that his younger brother will go free if he takes the life of his older brother. The premise of the story is where the films strength lies, and as the captivating tale unfolds it quickly becomes apparent that the characters lack the necessary depth for the audience to empathise with them. That's not to say that all of the performances are lacklustre, John Hurt is exceptional as an aged bounty hunter, and Ray Winstone puts in a powerful performance as Captain Stanley, however, i was more captivated by the stunning scenery and superb cinematography than most of the acting. As well as the breathtaking visuals, the haunting soundtrack was perfectly suited to the film's gritty edge, showcasing another of Nick Cave's many talents.Given time, the characters could have been developed into so much more but with the film running at just over 100 minutes, we are not given a chance to fully appreciate the motivation behind their actions. Despite not having mainstream appeal, this film is still very enthralling, and will certainly please film fans who have an appetite for revenge thrillers.7/10If you liked this film, you will also enjoy these:Dead Man Unforgiven The Assassination Of Jesse James By The Coward Robert Ford The Three Burials Of Melquiades Estrada</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Would you kill your older brother to save your younger brother from the noose? In 1800s Australia, somewhere in the rugged skeleton colonies of New South Wales, police trooper Captain Stanley (Ray Winstone) puts this proposition to Charlie Burns (Guy Pearce, greasier and grimier than he was in THE HARD WORD, 2002 ? if that's even possible).THE PROPOSITION is filth and dust and blood, punishing Outback heat bleeding off the screen; a land so untamed it spawns lawmen as sociopathic as the lawbreakers they pursue.Captain Stanley has the best intentions ("I will civilize this land") but has been hardened by the vicissitudes of keeping order in this barren world far from Britain. ("Australia. What fresh hell is this?") After capturing two of the three notorious Burns brothers, Charlie and Mikey, Stanley proposes to hang youngest brother Mikey come Christmas Day if Charlie has not yet killed his older brother, Arthur. Charlie reminds him he is only a copper, not a judge and jury, to which Stanley replies, "Clearly, Mr. Burns, I am what I wish to be." Arthur (foreboding Danny Huston) is the sadistic eldest brother singularly responsible for putting the "notorious" in Burns, so Captain Stanley proposes a pardon for Charlie and Mikey when Charlie kills Arthur.What no one counts on is the ruthlessness that comes at Charlie and Stanley from all sides: the insubordinate prison guards who disapprove of Stanley's plan and who can't stop thinking about rubbing their wonderful filth over Captain Stanley's delicate wife (Emma Watson); Captain Stanley's superior, sadistic Eden Fletcher (David Wenham, putting on the weaseliest voice he could possibly muster) who has Mikey flogged; bounty hunter Jellon Lamb (John Hurt, educated, articulate and crazy as the heat) who is also hunting Arthur; the aboriginals of this stolen land who pigstick Charlie in a shocking scene...Then there is Arthur Burns himself, a poet savage, a lunatic genius, "a monster, an abomination," whose credo of love and family are an insane irony when we learn of the family he recently raped and mass-murdered, the very reason for which Captain Stanley has set his own brother upon him.Arthur seems to realize what a deviant he is when he carves a knife down a man's chest, while asking brother Charlie, "Why can't you ever just - stop me?" The strange paradox of this movie is Arthur's rightness in the way he perpetrates his wrongness. When his young crazy gang member asks Arthur the definition of "misanthrope," their Aboriginal gang member answers and the youngster turns on him, "I didn't ask you, you black bastard!" Hilarity. Arthur replies, "A misanthrope is someone who hates every other bastard." Youngster: "Is that us?" Arthur: "Good lord, no! We're a family." Dark hilarity piled on dark hilarity.Words cannot describe this particular visual feast, baked in the furnace of the great southern desert land; when Captain Stanley sits on his porch and gazes out at the expanse of dry flat earth haze, the heaviness of the air makes it hard to breathe.Though everyone's performance is superb, Ray Winstone floats miles above the cast for nuance; just the way he holds tears in his eyes in moments when moral ambiguity clouds all reason, is enough to put tears in yours.And everyone gets to point a gun almost directly at the camera, arm ramrod straight, in hard closeup. We can see the director drooling at this angle.Written by Nick Cave (who also composed the dirty violin soundtrack), directed by John Hillcoat like shade never existed, THE PROPOSITION is a good hard bushranger tale ("bushranger" is the Aussie version of the wild west "outlaw"), probably the first to draw you into the old world so fully with its attention to 1800s detail and its ochre cinematography, the accepted social injustices toward the blacks (Aboriginals), and avoiding the base romanticism of Ned Kelly movies (Australia's most famous bushranger). What makes this film so immortal is that the words "outlaw" and "bushranger" are never mentioned - because by film's end, it is impossible to distinguish who the outlaws are.--Review by Poffy The Cucumber (for Poffy's Movie Mania).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a very good film. It's set in the Australian outback and the settings and cinematography put one in mind of the 1970's film Walkabout as it manages to capture perfectly the beauty yet incredible harshness of the Aussie Outback. The story is a simple one beautifully played out by fine actors at their peak. Mr Pearce has come a long, long way since he was Mike (in Neighbours), his broody and moody acting matched only by his fantastic beard! Ray Winstone plays his character with incredible sensitivity and, to be frank, couldn't get much better. The rest of the cast also work hard and provide superb back up.As a warning this is a slow film but the lack of speed serves to build up both the atmosphere and the tension. There's not much to the story which enhances the gritty and realistic feel of the film. With this one it's not the depth of the story, it's the depth of the way in which it is told. Sit back (with just a little patience) and enjoy!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still has me reeling</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A marvelous, haunting, brutal, tortured descent into the outback of right and wrong, The Proposition is as good, no as great a "Western" I've seen since Eastwood's Unforgiven. A beautiful evocation of a time and a place, cinematically stunning, musically spare and poetic, unremitting in it's executions of the will of violence and the struggle of men. But to me, The Proposition is a rumination on White Man's Burden, a fraught incursion into the moral morass of Australia's Aboriginal genocide and Christian hypocrisy, ignorance and fear. The disregard for the Aboriginies is pivotal to Arthur's (Danny Huston) madness, while Captain Stanley (Ray Winstone) must toe a line, one which nobody seems able to comprehend, in pursuit of civilization. Biblical homage can't get too much closer than one brother's murder of another, and the paradoxical simplicity/majesty of the basic acts resonates vibrantly throughout The Proposition. So, while I am less familiar with director John Hillcoat, I do know Nick Cave, so I can more easily attribute my visceral movements to his artistry, with no disregard to Hillcoat's direction. Nor any toward Guy Pearce, a chilling Huston or-(one of my absolute favorite actors)-Winstone. This is truly one of the best films of recent memory.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The merciless struggle for civilization in the Australian outback</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In this Australian western directed by John Hillcoat, Captain Stanley (Ray Winstone), representing Her Majesty's army in the wild Australian outback, captures notorious Irish outlaws Charlie Burns (Guy Pearce) and his younger simple-minded brother Mike. Stanley makes the following proposition to Charlie: either he kills his more dangerous older brother Arthur who's hiding in the wilderness and is wanted notably for the slaughter of a whole family and the rape and murder of a pregnant woman or Mike will be hanged on Christmas day.Penned by Aussie rock musician Nick Cave, the fantastic and poetic script for "The proposition" plays on a familiar theme found in many other westerns, notably John Ford's "My darling Clementine", "The searchers" and "The man who shot Liberty Valance": the struggle between civilized order and anarchy that civilization cannot win without the help of outsiders closer the anarchy pole. In "The proposition", Captain Stanley is the civilizing force, Charlie Burns is the outsider whose help he needs to achieve his goal but the anarchic side is not so much represented by Arthur Burns than by the land itself, the Australian outback, of which Arthur seems to be the physical manifestation. As Roger Ebert pointed in his review, "The proposition" is like a western shot in Colorado if Colorado was located in hell: a dusty desert constantly burned by the sun with legions of flies covering any being, dead or alive, foolish enough to go there, a god-forsaken country where death is omnipresent.This makes Captain Stanley's commitment "to civilize this land" tragic and absurd as the outback seems so hostile to human life that the fight seems impossible to win or not worth the sacrifice it will require. This is perfectly illustrated in a scene where Stanley tries to have a traditional English breakfast, with poshed eggs and bacon, in the middle of his garden where he managed to grow a couple of roses: his attempt to keep a British lifestyle seems surrealistic with the desert surrounding him, flies flying constantly around his breakfast plate. Moreover, the civilization Stanley is fighting for doesn't seem to be worth the fight itself: a violent, racist society, organizing the genocide of the Arborigines and revealing in gruesome parody of justice, as when Mike Burns is whipped to death on a public square. Stanley himself is above that. Although a violent man by necessity, Ray Winstone's portrayal gives him a great humanity: he is sensitive, devoted to his mission and tenderly loving his wife (Emily Watson) that he tries to shelter from the violence of the life in the outback. Although at the beginning of the film, Stanlay seems to be the one in the position of power, it clearly appears that this is not the case and that he made a dangerous bargain by letting Charlie go free: if he betrays him, Arthur will come for him and no force on earth seems to be able to stop him. Arthur Burns, portrayed in a mesmerizing way by Danny Huston, is an almost supernatural figure in the movie: living like a mad prophet in a cave, quoting Shakespeare, the Aborigenes think he is not a human but a werewolf and might as well be. He spends his days sitting on top of a mountain, starring intensively at the land surrounding him, leaving his lair only to bring death and destruction in a whirlwind of fury and brutality. To find him, his brother Charlie has to ride through a literal land of dead, filled with rotten corpses of both animals and human beings and has to symbolically die himself, an Aborigene's spear piercing him through and through. Arthur Burns is like an ancient evil god, the personification of the outback itself, representing its mystery, its mystic, its brutality and its hostility to life.Although dominated by Huston and Winstone, the rest of the cast is excellent too, especially John Hurt playing a scene-stealing bounty hunter. Depicting in realistic terms the violence of both the Burns brothers and the English army, The movie is extremely violent and bloody, the obvious reference here being Sam Peckinpah. Besides the script, Nick Cave also composed the haunting soundtrack.An instant classic, "The proposition" is the best western since Clint Eastwood's "Unforgiven", and a major contribution to an important genre.</fullReview>

I have seen this movie twice already and no doubt, will be seeing it again. Unlike many glamorized versions of the west, this movie shows the filth and uncertainty of the time. I read the that director wanted to be true to the time and had the buttons on the costume made by hand, and believe me when I say it shows.

		<shortDescription>A masterpiece.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let's face it, I thought to myself as I sat down to watch The Proposition, an Aussie western written by grungy singer-songwriter Nick Cave. The Western's time is over. After an all time high with the Leone films, the Western fizzled (Silverado), sank (Open Range), and finally bombed (American Outlaws). But The Proposition is a savage, complex beauty of film that would give Leone goosebumps. The story is deceptively simple; In order to save his younger brother from the gallows, Charlie Burns (Guy Pearce), must kill his older brother. What sounds like a one-trick pony of a film is actually incredible. Charlie's run in with a profane, racist bounty hunter (played with quirky grandeur by the excellent John Hurt) manges to be white-hot suspenseful and gut-busting hilarious all at one. Ray Winstone gives a tour de force performance as an English immigrant desperate to keep his civilized way of life, and protect his wife (Emily Watson) from the dangers of the Outback. Nick Cave's stark score and the meticulous costume design add to the movie's excellence, as does the cinematography- this film is simply one of the best-looking ones ever made. Now that I think about it, this movie resembles a Nick Cave song; an intricate, intelligent bit of dark poetry that lurches through bouts of violence and tragedy, occasionally stopping for a glint of meaningful emotion. And, like a Nick Cave song, by the end of it, I was awed, and sad that nothing else in the world could ever be quite like it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Raw Story That Gleams Like a Diamond</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THE PROPOSITION is one of the more satisfying 'westerns' to come along in years. Just as Serge Leone created the spaghetti westerns in Italy and set a precedent that American films were to follow, so director John Hillcoat and writer Nick Cave turn the back country of 1880s Australia into a devastating impressive work of grit, dirt, lawlessness and hardship of living in the early days of Australia's distance from Britain. This is an art piece sculpted from brilliant actors, some of the finest photography on the screens today, and a film score that is breathtakingly beautiful.Shot almost entirely in shades of umber and sienna THE PROPOSITION is the tale of a gang of brothers - Charlie Burns (Guy Pearce), Mikey Burns (Richard Wilson) and hooligan and evil Arthur Burns (Danny Huston) - who have wrecked havoc on a frontier town under the eye of police Captain Stanley (Ray Winstone), married to the lovely Martha Stanley (Emily Watson), and the extremes to which the law will go to capture the worst of the perpetrators, Arthur. After a gruesome shoot out Charlie and Mikey are captured, but Captain Stanley propositions Charlie to bring in his loathsome brother Arthur to spare young brother Mike from the gallows on Christmas. Charlie rides out to find Arthur, encounters a bounty hunter Jellon Lamb (a brilliant tour de force role for John Hurt), mixes with the aborigines, and ultimately confronts Arthur. And that is quite enough of the story to relate in brief.It is the quality of the film that takes your breath away. Not only is the acting utterly first rate by the entire large cast, but the rhapsody of imagery created by the camera of Benoît Delhomme and the haunting score from the pens of Nick Cave and Warren Ellis give us a frame after glowing frame gallery of some of the most beautiful film ever made. This is a movie so rich in story and production that it is bound to become considered as one of the greats of the western ilk. Highly recommended (for those who can tolerate a lot of violence!).

		<shortDescription>New Mythological Villain!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Arthur Burns sits perched on the rocks over-looking the Australian range, staring at the clouds covering the full moon and can smell the death and violence in the air; the camera focuses on his eyes while the rage builds. The juxtaposition of the next scene blazes as a fire is literally lit in his hide-out, and suddenly as his horse beats the barren ground the soundtrack sounds like demons are unleashed. The lost poetic soul we just saw, discussing the need humanity has for love, famine and family is now the raging demon that crusades across the outback - and this is the new myth of Arthur Burns. Arthur Burns belongs in the pantheon of greatest and most complex villains of movie history. This film was perfectly acted, written and shot. The expert eye of Hillcoat has been unmatched in westerns since Eastwood shot Unforgiven. The Proposition has just slid into my number 2 slot of favorite westerns. The scene described above is just a small sample of the mastery that exists in the score and the composition of every shot. Ray Winstone - fast becoming one of my favorite actors. He was brilliant in Sexy Beast, and now another script came around written with such poetry that it caters perfectly to Ray's ability.Everyone must see this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Be grateful. That shower you use? Those things weren't always common. There weren't many in 1880s Australia, in a setting similar to the U.S. wild west. Most everyone in The Proposition is filthy and attracting flies to no end. Several people witnessing an event midway through the movie are shown with hundreds of tiny bugs on their backs, and the main characters find themselves squinting throughout the film to keep them out of their eyes. I was wondering at points if cg was used to add some of them. But I'm also a bit unsure as to why we saw so many. I mean obviously these characters would have a stench, but are the flies an effort to portray something extremely realistic, or was it some sort of metaphor? These are filthy people, making rash decisions, performing unforgivable deeds. They are no better than the corpses which fill the screen occasionally which are also attracting so many flies.This is one of the better westerns I've ever seen. Charlie Burns (Guy Pearce) and his younger brother Mike are capture by Captain Stanley (Ray Winstone). Justice is sought for the recent slaying of a local family. Mike is young and quite helpless, so Stanley focuses on Charlie and offers him a deal. He will let Charlie go for the moment to seek out and kill the one really responsible for the killings: Charlie's older brother Arthur. There isn't much choice in the matter though. If he does not succeed, Mike will be hung in just over a week's time. On Christmas actually. If he succeeds, Charlie and Mike will go free.This is not your typical western. For one, it's exceedingly violent, so I shall dust off my old Bad Boys II Violence Warning here. All sorts of nastiness that would better be left as a surprise. What I perhaps liked the most in the film was how these characters change in your mind. It seems pretty clear cut at the start who the responsible parties are, and who is the "villian" and who can do no wrong. But this will not be the case. It is also not a situation where the plot twists and turns. I would just rather say that the story will progress and get more interesting. The proposition that Stanley offers Charlie in the beginning is certainly the setup for the film, but what are the precise implications for all those involved? Though the setting is a desolate area, the cinematography is still quite breathtaking in several scenes. It even won three separate awards for cinematography, as well as its soundtrack, last year in Australia. So I don't want to say this film was as good as Unforgiven, but comparisons are there. It has an effective look, it's a different kind of western, and there is some truly great dialogue in there. The U.S. release is quite limited, but check it out if you can.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best film I have seen in a very long time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My all time top five favourite films is a list that has remained happily undisturbed for the past few years. I've seen some excellent films in that time but nothing that has had me scratching my head and getting ready for the problems of entering a new entry. Until last week when I came out of the cinema having seen The Proposition. This film is simply magnificent. The direction is stunning and should have won the director an Oscar - every scene feels as though it has been carefully thought about and this makes for beautiful and harrowing visions of the wild Australian frontier. The acting is marvellous with Ray Winstone putting in a career best performance (which is really saying something for Britain's best actor). Everyone else is also superb even down to the sinister locals who in their looks and mannerisms seem to have stepped straight out of the nineteenth century. Yes, the film is disturbing and the violence can make for uncomfortable viewing. But this is of course necessary to bring home just how dangerous and anarchic life on the frontier really must have been. The film's score helps to create a haunting atmosphere throughout and the story, though simple, is genuinely moving. I really am not used to using so many superlatives in a film review but The Proposition leaves me no choice. Anyone who enjoys cinema must see it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Got the DVD from Australia and sat to watch this this evening. I heard of this as a Nick Cave fan (and indeed a fan of 'westerns') I was blown away by the quality of this film, the acting, direction, script &amp; beautiful cinematography. A bleak, violent and powerful account of the outlaws and police in 19th Century Australia. Guy Pearce is amazing in this, although he has few lines really, he conveys a complex stir of emotions throughout this film. I can see why this has drawn comparisons with Apocalypse Now, as there is a powerful journey at the heart (of darkness?) of this film. I urge you to see this. Fantastic use of the bleak beauty of the Australian outback, vibrant sunsets and bleak desert storms serve as the backdrop to this tale of lawlessness and deceit.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Nick Cave wrote the screenplay for this western set in late 1800's Australia. It follows the lives of a lawman, an outlaw and the one who comes between them as a mutual ally/enemy. It is very gritty with it's depictions of violence and cruelties of the time which may put off some people, but it is very rewarding to sit through. The struggle between the Irish. Australian and Aboriginal people is truly mesmerizing and captured my attention throughout the whole film. One thing the film did was portray every character as a good and bad element, making you sympathize and detest them, proving that there is never good/evil, but just people.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sheer brilliance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have always passionately disliked Australian films. Every one I have seen seemed to be an attempted revisioning of a markedly superior American film and it just didn't wash. However, 'The Proposition' is a fresh new look on the Western genre and director John Hillcoat succeeded in turning Nick Cave's script into a brilliant work of art.'The Proposition' begins with a gritty and intensely realistic gunfight between a gang of Ned Kelly-esquire outlaws and the police. When the law finally overpowers the criminals, they invade their hideout. Inside are two brothers. One of the brothers, played with exceptional skill by Guy Pierce, is given an ultimatum: find your older brother, a misfit murderer/rapist, or your young sibling is hung for the crimes. The story moves at a relentless pace from then on - incorporating brilliant scenery, bloody violence and great acting and direction to add to the amazing tone of the film. For those with a weak stomach, there are some scenes in 'The Proposition' that may not be for you. One particular scene, involving a very bloody and realistic whipping scene reminiscent of 'The Passion of the Christ' will be imprinted in your mind for quite a while.In short, 'The Proposition' is an Australian film that succeeds on so many accounts. Hillcoat's third cinematic feature is certainly his best, and should be given a wider acclaim than what it is already receiving. I highly recommend this film to anybody who is a Western film afficondo or to people who enjoyed Sergio Leone's spaghetti westerns.RATING: (in Australia): MA 15+ for Strong Violence and Coarse Language.</fullReview>

Show the harsh reality of those times in those conditions. The acting was wonderful in particular Pearce and Winstone. Ray Winstone i had seen little of but came away a huge rap for,he played his tormented , frustrated role well. Pearce shone....Marvell's. I think if you go to this film looking for some deep meaning you will be disappointed...take it for what it is and enjoy it, a film about loyalty, betrayal and endurance in some of the worlds harshest conditions.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>John Hillcoat's masterfully directed Australian Western, "The Proposition" is a morally ambiguous treatise on betrayal, loyalty, and justice in a pre-industrial revolution colonial society. There's something brilliantly unsettling about a movie that starts off immediately with an ominous sense that "this is not going to end well." The viewer is thrown right into a horrible dilemma, and with its grisly violence that is as wonderfully photographed as the mythic Australian Outback the blood is splattered against, you get the white-knuckled feeling that something terrible is about to happen at any moment. Nick Cave's fantastic script unfolds like a great novel, told from multiple points of view with superb character development and dialogue that ranges from the poetic to the psychotic on themes both Biblical and Shakespearian in scope and is not surprisingly married perfectly to the haunting music score, also from Nick Cave.The highly stylized direction, which combines classic cinematography and near-perfect framing of scenes with avant-garde flourishes, would alone make for a fine film, but you also have an amazing cast that lifts the film towards greatness. Danny Huston is quite literally scary as hell as the madman leader of the murderous Burns gang. Ray Winstone and Emily Watson are methodically perfect in their roles as a husband and wife desperately trying to bring civility to a lawless land. Guy Pierce, though basically doing a riff on his classic characters from "Memento" and "Ravenous," is gritty and compelling.Like all great films, "The Proposition" is most memorable for its finely painted details. Aside from some of the most graphic violence ever captured on screen, I will never forget moments of surreal beauty: the Australian landscape bathed in a twilight glow, the sunset behind Ayer's Rock, and the ghostly paleness of Emily Watson's face as she turns her gaze away from her husband and thinks of something horrid.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Finally an Australian movie that audiences can relate to and enjoy.After several years of misfires at the cinemas with Australian movies that were either just plain bad (Deck Dogz is a prime example) or when they have been good just plain inaccessible to mainstream audiences (Somersault, well done but a very bleak and empty movie)an Australian Movie comes along that has actually blown my socks off.The Proposition is pure Cinema at its best, with Cinematography that makes the outback look like a living Hell during the day and Heaven on Earth at Night, Location Sets, Costumes and Props that are so Historically accurate you get a true understanding of what British settlers really had to face when settling in a Hostile New Land. Direction, Script, and Performances so taut and tight that each scene will resonate in your memory long after you have left the cinema.Its not hard to see why Master Actors like John Hurt, Ray Winstone, Guy Pearce, Emily Watson, and, David Wenham put up with 55degree Celsius (131degrees Fahrenheit) weather on a Daily Basis without complaining once to the Producers or Crew when they were involved in one of the greatest movies that any of them would have done in recent memory.This is a movie that has to be seen on the Big Screen of a Cinema to be truly appreciated for its scope and cinematography.Without a doubt this movie will be nominated for many Academy Awards and will win at least one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just got back from seeing this picture at probably my favorite film theater but I arrived a bit late and missed the first 10 minutes with the gunfight they said was really quite brilliant. So perhaps my view on this picture alters from the masses but I still give thumbs up and say that this film is an AFI asset. This film was not boring like the westerns of old and even thought Sergio's films were cinematic gold, I feel they grow tedious with a secondary watching, but this film had action told a simple tale and sets and scenery right to the smallest detail. The acting was great, the dialogue never clunky and morals we're clear though not in the beginning. It gave the right impression of this barren land where the flies are small demons and heat sucks out your soul and all your feelings. Where the sun turns from enemy to an artist's impression of the beauty we all know we could be achieving. This film is violent but not for no reason, it shocks you and scares you into believing what the morals and ethics are hidden within this exciting western set in Australia with bushrangers and trackers and knives and gun wheelin'. Truly a great film that I was glad to be watching showing the world that Australia can do it and maybe they'll give somebody who had a part in it an Oscar or award, but I wouldn't count on it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>2005's "The Proposition" is a Western that takes place in Australia, and it's far from a typical Western.THE PLOT: Captain Stanley (Ray Winstone) is the new lawman of the territory and he's determined to civilize this brutal wasteland. In his way is a band of outlaws comprised of three brothers and a few others, but two of the brothers want out after the leader, Arthur Burns (Danny Huston), savagely murders a family in one of his raids. The two brothers are apprehended by Capt. Stanley, who offers a proposition to the older of the two, Charlie Burns (Guy Pearce): Find and assassinate the leader and both will go free. Charlie agrees to the assignment to save his little brother, not to mention he believes Arthur crossed the line when he killed the innocent family, which included a wife with child. Plus Charlie seeks redemption.As far as filmmaking, cinematography, actors, locations, soundtrack &amp; editing go this is a top-of-the-line film with a surreal, haunting edge. As my title blurb suggests, there are similarities to "Heart of Darkness" and the original "Apocalypse Now," although it fails to achieve the greatness of the latter.The story plays out in a realistic manner with long stretches of drama and bleak landscapes interspersed with flashes of extreme violence. Ray Winstone and Guy Pearce are great as the two main protagonists. Capt. Stanley understandably wants to rid the land of the brute outlaws, whereas Charlie seeks redemption for himself and his little brother. Danny Huston as Arthur Burns is captivating as the focal point and villain. Yet he's not a villain in the clichéd sense and he's not one-dimensional. He loves the beauty of God's creation, he loves the art of language and he's a mystic of sorts, but he clearly crossed the line at some point in his outlaw endeavors and now must be wiped off the face of the planet. Will Charlie do it? My only criticism is that the film seems too short. It needed more time for details and character development. As it is, we sort of have to guess the details, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. I just wish the film would have gone the route of "Apocalypse Now" and given us more definition and development. Another minor criticism is that I wished they picked someone other than Emily Watson to play Capt. Stanley's wife. Not that she does a bad job in the role; it's just a matter of taste.The runtime is 104 minutes.FINAL WORD: "The Proposition" is one of those films that gets better with repeat viewings, as long as you like the approach of films like "Apocalypse Now," albeit way shorter (too short). I would love to see a Director's Cut that adds about 20-45 minutes.GRADE: B+</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm a lover of westerns and this is one of the best. Yeah, it's bloody and violent as I'm sure the early days of Australia were just that. The grittiness of the environment make the movie feel authentic, you can almost smell the people who lived during that era. Ray Winstone delivers his best as the tough lawman with a conscience, and Emily Watson balances him as his proper English wife. John Hurt portrays the bounty hunter in an eccentric way, displaying his classic training as an actor. The movie doesn't romanticize the western life, it shows it as it most likely was, dirty, hard and dangerous. The story will lead you to a somewhat predictable outcome and the characters involved along the way keep you interested to the end.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Why, said the clouds to the stars in the sky" whispers a cryptic, singsong voice while a lone rider gallops through a desolate landscape. The speaker reads some more lines and a tone is set which is spooky, mystical and dark. Scenes like this stand out the most to me. This movie has some timeless, unforgettable images and some of the characters are very real, particularly the youngest Burns brother. It's hard not to relate to him, cowering and crying in his cell. There's a variety of interesting characters in the movie, and although it isn't totally successful (the oldest Burns brother, while a refreshingly offbeat and literate character, is too sketchy and Stanley's wife has dialogue that seems more unconvincing than other characters) it is an intriguing moodpiece with some genuine, unsettling and mythical qualities.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Australian Western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Western genre has often been the domain of American filmmakers, with Akira Kurosawa who transferred the genre to Medieval Japan. However in recent years they have been non-American entries look at their own version of the Wild West. Here is an Australian effort and it can easily challenge some of the best Westerns out at the moment.Set in the late 19th Century, Captain Stacey (Ray Winstone), give the Irish outlaw Charlie Burns (Guy Pierce) that he finds difficult to refuse: he will share Charlie and his slow-witted younger brother Mikey (Richard Wilson) from the Gallows in exchange for Charlie killing his older psychopathic brother Arthur (Danny Huston). Charlie pretty much has to take it, but it tests his morality to the limit. Captain Stacey also lives a tough live. He is a British veteran, given the task to bring law and order to the Outback, fight Aboriginal resistance and protect his wife Martha (Emily Watson) from the tough world and keep her innocence. He too lives in a tricky moral world, not really wanting to kill Mikey who he sees as a pawn of his brothers, despite what the local community think.The world set out by the director John Hillcoat is not a nice fantasy world. The Outback of Australia was grim, and here he makes a really grim and gritty Western with realistic violence and shows the harsh climate of that part of the world. Hillcoat understands that world and he seems to have a bright future. His adaption of The Road looks promising. He shows the mix picture within the groups and the international make-up of Australia at the time.Nick Cave writes an excellent script, showing the moral issues that affect the characters, from Captain Stacey protecting his wife and bringing law and order to the Outback, to Charlie's loyalty to his brothers. Many have they own case for you to support them. This was not a black and white world. Cave also writes a good score for the film.They are excellent actors in this film. Ray Winstone offers one of his strongest performances and I would like to see him in more roles like this. Guy Pierce, a actor of great talent, offers another good performance and has an excellent Irish accent. Emily Watson is directed well in this film. So was Danny Huston. Even many of the supporting actors like John Hurt and Richard Wilson had chances to shine.An excellent film for Western fans.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More existential than spaghetti.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When watching a Western film it is very difficult to not compare it to traditional Westerns. They all generally share the same gritty, open expanse camera shots and the same mean characters that you really shouldn't like, but root for anyway. Sometimes drawing these comparisons can help determine whether the new breed are up to standard or not, but there are cases where accepting a film as a certain genre before seeing it can hinder the viewing experience (for example Lars and the Real Girl). This is because as a viewer you are expecting to see the characteristics that films of the past have defined. 2005's The Proposition is such a film where ignoring the 'western' tagline (and all the preconceptions that come with it) will ultimately increase your enjoyment of the film and what you get from it.The plot at face value is deceptively simple. A town in 19th Century Australia is being terrorised by the "Burns Gang", which is made up of three Irish brothers and other social outcasts. The captain of the police force, Captain Stanley (played by Ray Winstone) is looking to find and bring to justice the leader of the gang Arthur Burns (Danny Huston) after they recently murdered a family. Captain Stanley captures two of the brothers, Charlie Burns (Guy Pearce) and the youngest of the three, Mike Burns, played by Richard Wilson. He offers Charlie a deal: find and kill Arthur or Mike dies.Quickly deciding to take Stanley up on the offer, the film then follows from different viewpoints the two characters having to deal with the results of the Burns attack. From Stanley's point of view we see how the Burns gang has mutated the town into bloodthirsty monsters, eager to find a scapegoat as quickly as possible even if they are innocent. The film drags the audience with Stanley into the barren wilderness where he struggles with the notion of family, loyalty and morality. When looking at the plot on paper it appears like a typical Western: murder, vengeance, self-discovery, rise of the outcasts. In reality the film is slow, meditative and more existential than spaghetti. In order to truly reap the rewards of the film, you must try to forget it has certain conventions of the Western and instead look at it as a film about colonialism, culture, alienation and society. While there are some brutal gun fights during the film, they are filmed in much the same manner as the rest of the scenes: subtle, to the point and most importantly, realistic. Unlike some other Western themed pieces (such as Deadwood) the picture is never crowded; the world where these characters live is a barren desert, which creates an impression of intimacy between the audience and characters as there is often so much space on screen with only one or two people occupying it. From this you may be able to guess that the cinematography is gorgeous throughout: beautiful sunsets, mountains, characters thoughtfully staring at the sky in awe can all be expected in truckloads. However, if you're the type of film fan who likes a great variety of shots, locations and sets, it is likely you will not get your hit here. If, on the other hand, you like character depth and some fine acting (who doesn't?) you should be pleased. Like the gun fights, the characters are subtly created and developed, rarely giving anything away to the audience apart from mannerisms or the odd philosophical snippet from Arthur Burns.If you are familiar with the writer, Nick Cave, from his other musical projects or films, it is likely you will know he likes to intersect bluntness and symbolism. Therefore what you get are characters that act and talk realistically, but are shrouded in religious and historical symbolism to help the audience discern who they are. This is helped even more so by an impressive list of actors portraying them. While all the actors are fine in their roles, it can seem that some of them (Guy Pearce in particular) may have been told to play the characters so consciously reserved that it didn't give them a lot of room to work in. The result therefore is that they are convincing and more than adequate at portraying what the characters are supposed to be, but are never really given the opportunity to break out and show different sides. The standout roles I believe are Jellon Lamb and Arthur Burns. While John Hurt, who played Jellon Lamb has a reasonably small role in the film as a bounty hunter looking to capture the Burns brothers, he gives the character just enough insanity to make him the most puzzling and interesting of them all. Danny Auston not only portrays Author Burns as a self-aware psychopath with a tendency to turn killing into torture, but also as an intelligent man, who is compassionate towards nature and loyal to his family.The Proposition is a very good drama film about multiple subjects in a wrapping that can at first seem difficult to get into. While it can be classed as a Western, people who are expecting to sit down and see the next Unforgiven will be disappointed. This is a thoughtful, intelligent comment of the difference of societies and how colonialism can affect nations. The direction, acting and writing are all of a good standard and the cinematography is beautiful. Two standout performances from John Hurt and Danny Auston and the blunt yet symbolically rich script from Nick Cave is highly effective yet restrictive in places.</fullReview>

This movie is lyrical, beautiful, deep, shocking and absorbent. It may disturb people because of it's violence, and that makes the film much more visually shocking, but still I think The Proposition is unique.Verdict: An intelligent, impeccable, painful and heart rendering Australian movie.

There is brilliant symbolism in this movie. Like any western, you have your lawmen and your outlaws. The lawmen want to civilize the country with this being reflected in their little cozy homes and proper attire. The outlaws don't care for structure so they appear dirty and unkempt, like the dust that refuses to be cleaned off the lawmen cozy homes. The western genre has always been a breeding ground for matching theme to content. The Proposition is no different and excels. This is a very real western.

		<fullReview>This low key (but far from non-violent) western may be set in Australia, but the plot borrows much from traditional American fare; it's a re-run of 'The Wild Bunch', with the odd nod to 'Unforgiven' thrown in (although the western is such a well-defined genre, there are probably countless other films that it echoes as well). It's superiority over the herd lies in the fact that the lawman (Ray Winstone) trying to keep order is actually painted with some sympathy; and the romanticisation of the outlaws is very limited compared with otherwise similar movies. And whereas I hated the way that 'Unforgiven' encouraged us to judge its characters by modern standards, the moral universe of 'The Proposition' is subtle, but very much of its time. On one hand the plot is slow, and Winstone and Emily Watson (who plays his character's wife) have rarely been more subdued (John Hurt, on the other hand, in a cameo role, steals his scenes); but as the ending approaches, the film takes on the proportions of a perfect tragedy. Mostly, I find westerns lazy and clichéd; but this is an intelligent film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a violent, bloody, and beautiful movie that deserves to go down in history as one of the best Western movies ever made. The three stars, Danny Huston, Guy Pearce, and Ray Winstone all deserved Oscar nominations, as well as the cinematography. Whether you like his character or not(Its hard at times to like any of the characters) Ray Winstone gives one of the best quiet performances I have ever seen. There are two scenes, one of Sheriff Stanley offering a proposition to Charlie Burns and the performance of the song Peggy Gordon that will give you shivers. This is a great piece of Australian cinema that should not be missed. One of the best movies of the last five years.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Harsh men are born of a harsh environment; that's a given; but the fellas herein fairly wallow in their harshness. If any one of them (on either side of The Law) has any redeeming qualities whatsoever, I missed 'em. There are no "grey" characters (with the possible exception of the woman): these are men whose hearts are black as midnight. Though there are instances throughout where the story might've faltered or the filmmakers balked, that (thankfully) doesn't happen. And the end is in-your-face hardcore. THE PROPOSITION goes that extra yard and doesn't punk out. Fantastic film-making. (Did I make mention of the fact that the cinematography is gorgeous?)

		<shortDescription>Evil walks this land - but to what end?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film features beautiful cinematography, an exotic locale, and an outstanding cast, including John Hurt, Danny Huston, Guy Pearce, Emily Watson, David Wenham, and Ray Winstone. Its grim depiction of the Australian frontier in the 1880's features a character who might best be described as Manichaean: Evil, incarnate, and among us.Various precedents for this premise come to mind. When, in Mozart's opera Don Giovanni, society has no answer for unbridled evil, The Stone Guest intervenes and drags the villain down to Hell. In Peter Greenaway's film The Cook, the Thief, His Wife, &amp; Her Lover, a post-Enlightenment world has no supernatural foil for the villain, who marauds unopposed by any civil authority. At the outset of The Proposition we understand that Arthur Burns (Huston) and those in his thrall, are capable of the most outrageous atrocities and care nothing about human society. Who in this world can withstand such a creature? We are shown at every turn how Burns and his clan seem to be as natural to this harsh, unforgiving environment as desert scorpions. In contrast to their very nature are Martha Stanley (Watson) and Eden Fletcher (Wenham), who choose to pretend their rose bushes and fine saddle horses are no more incongruous here than if they were back in England. It is their unexamined assumption that British justice can also be transplanted to the Outback that places Captain Stanley ? Martha's devoted husband and Fletcher's dutiful enforcer ? at the center of this story.The Proposition is really the project of Nick Cave, a songwriter who created both its screenplay and its musical score. Both are adequate for the telling of this engaging story, but what of its archetypal monster? The Judge in Cormac McCarthy's novel Blood Meridian, seems to be more than a man and more like a force of nature. Whether man or phenomenon, there seems to be some terrible, obscure, operative principle behind him. The fact that we are unable to imagine what that principle may be is what makes him so terrifying.There doesn't appear to be any such principle behind Arthur Burns. Languishing in squalor in his desert lair, he pursues no agenda, beyond eating rancid meat and swatting at flies. Yet he knows poetry, appreciates a well-sung song, and never fails to admire a beautiful sunset. The evil which Burns embodies and perpetrates in his godforsaken corner of the world is, to be sure, terrible enough. But it stands little chance of withstanding civilization's encroachment, whether Captain Stanley can foresee that day or not.Which brings us to the film's title. Stanley charges Charlie Burns (Pearce) with the task of bringing his big brother's career to an end. Charlie must choose between barbarism and humanity, but why does he choose as he does? I am not convinced Cave has created a character who knows.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went straight to the liquor cabinet and poured a shot of bourbon after watching this movie. This is an unsettling movie that is not for everyone. Director John Hillcoat paints a picture of the untamed Austrailian beginnings that is simultaneously beautiful and ugly. Nick Cave's poetic screenplay covers many subjects of this time frame without losing focus on the film's purpose. The cast is great from top to bottom. Nick Cave also contributes a terrific soundtrack. The violence in the movie pulls no punches, but it is also the roots of violence in the depth of these characters that make this film disturbing. The landscape of the Austrailian Outback captures a backdrop reminiscent of Monument Valley. All the violence leads to an empty feeling at the end, but this might be a credit to the movie's frank method. Kudos are definitely in order here for everyone involved. Perhaps this is will be a catalyst for a new era of western movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>an Australian western to shake the ages</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A great film. The movie takes place in the outback of Austrailia. Even with its awkward setting, the movie still keeps the exciting theme of a western.The main characters are the three burns brothers, all criminals. Charlie burns (Guy Pierce) is a vigilante, deadly with a weapon, and cares much for his younger brother Mike Burns (Richard Wilson). Mike is the tamest of the three, and is afraid of violence. The last brother, Arthur Burns (Danny Huston), is insane. He is fond of violence and uses it effectively. After Charlie and mike are captured, Sgt Lawrence (Robert Morgen), offers Charlie a proposition. He proposes that Charlie will kill Arthur, who is a menace to society, in exchange for the life of mike. The story is about Charlie's amazing adventure to find Arthur. Meanwhile, Mike is being prosecuted and tortured by the townspeople who want him dead.This movie was ingenious. There are twists and turns at every corner. This move was original and yet still utilizes the wonderful western themes. I highly recommend this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Take a Journey Outback---If You Dare.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Australian Bushrange Era of the late-19th century is an unforgiving and uncivilized land that makes the U.S. Old West of the same period look like something straight from Charles Dickens or Norman Rockwell. A constable (Ray Winstone) tries desperately to stop the reign of terror of a heartless group of outlaws who seem to have no conscience, no fear and no emotion. He captures two brothers (mysterious Guy Pearce and out-of-place Richard Wilson) and comes up with a plan to capture the third and most dangerous brother (Danny Huston in a whopping performance). Winstone propositions Pearce to kill Huston in a week's time and if he accomplishes his mission he will let Wilson go. Thus dilemmas aplenty for Pearce as he has until Christmas Day ironically to save his younger brother by killing his older one. Official David Wenham (a standout in "The Lord of the Rings" trilogy) presses Winstone to punish Wilson, effectively making the whole plan go awry. Winstone's wife (dynamite turn as usual for Emily Watson) is the only notable female in a time and place where women were little more than an after-thought. Also along for the ride is the highly enigmatic John Hurt who nearly steals the show with two whacked scenes that blend in well with the intoxicatingly brutal and crazed story. A pure trial of near-epic proportions to sit through as "The Proposition" is a down-right nasty and ugly masterpiece that sucks you in to its demented world with ultra-violent sequences, a hypnotic score and landmark cinematography. Relative unknown director John Hillcoat keeps you tense with a pull-out-all-the-stops mentality as he pushes the envelope on the cowboy genre with arguably the finest addition since Sam Peckinpah's "The Wild Bunch". Adapted perfectly by Nick Cave from Cormac McCarthy's "Blood Meridian", "The Proposition" knocks you down, kicks you, spits on you and goes totally ballistic after that. Atmospherically realized winner. 5 stars out of 5.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Film Review: The Proposition (Possible Spoilers) On very rare occasion does a motion picture surface which is as disgustingly filthy as "The Proposition." And even rarer is when a statement similar to the preceding is one of admiration. As a general rule, when a film production company attempts to create a gritty and soiled motion picture, the results are minimal, at best. While the players are made to look dirty, there is still a sense of style and beauty behind the layers of obvious makeup. That is nowhere near the case in this film. To exemplify, the most easily recognizable actor in this picture, Guy Pearce (Memento, LA Confidential), is almost unrecognizable as the murderer, Charlie Burns. I would almost believe Pearce forewent bathing for a fortnight while sleeping under stars in some desolate and humid area. His stringy and oily hair, dirty and dusty face and horribly stained clothing are so effective, the layers of grease seem to all but ooze over the edge of the movie screen and into the theater. Hollywood doesn't treat it's actors this way; there needs to be some beauty to sell! Furthermore, "The Devil's Rejects" only wishes it could've been this gross.The basic premise of this film is one of loyalty and family ties. The aforementioned murderer, Charlie Burns is responsible, along with his brothers, Arthur and Mikey, for massacring the Hopkins Family. While this massacre unfolds before the events of the film take place, that particular event forms the general backdrop of the story and has set events in motion. To be brief, Charlie and Mikey are apprehended and Charlie is given the option of tracking down and slaughtering Arthur in exchange for his and Mikeys lives.Anyone familiar with other recent artistic Western interpretations, most notably Dead Man, will easily accept the on screen action, which is very sparse. As the film is set against the backdrop of an incredibly rural Australia in the late 1800s, there is not a lot to interfere with the dusty desolation of the Bush, and the camera spends its time documenting this fact. However, the general photography presented prevents this picture from being dull. There is also a level of gore found within which is absent from all but the most over-the-top horror films. However, this gore is not gratuitous, nor does it exploit. The function of the gore in this film is to help convey the brutal lifestyle of the times, whether completely fictionalized or not.While very few (if any) motion pictures are without flaw, there are several aspects of this film which prevent me from awarding it a higher score. The most glaring fault of this film is presented approximately halfway through. The scene in question involves the flogging of young Mikey Burns, who was partially responsible for the Hopkins Massacre. This particular scene felt heavy-handed, forced and far too preachy for its own good.Overall, this film comes highly recommended and is certainly worthy of subsequent viewings. I know I'll purchase a copy when the DVD is released.7.5 out of 10G.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is set nearing the end of the Bushranger era. Charlie Burns (Guy Pearce) is sent out by Captain Stanley (Ray Winstone) to kill his brother Arthur Burns who is a notorious gang member who is responsible for rape and murder in order to keep his other brother Mike Burns alive. So Charlie Burns sets out after his brother who is unknowing of his predicament. Without telling anymore of the story this Aussie film has been greatly filmed and has great filming locations. The storyline of the movie itself does everything. The thing that brought the movie down is the racism to aboriginals and violence against them. The violence itself in the movie is well plenty there is probably to much graphic violence but overall a great movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Set in Australia of old, law and lawlessness, racism and abuse, nick caves screenplay is a brutal one yet strangely subtle at the same time. Ray Winstone plays the sheriff determined to capture the one man who has eluded him and will stop at no cost. So he enlists the mans own brother (guy Pearce) to kill him and thus pardon his own misdoings and those of his other little brother. This Australia is hot, dirty and full of flies. Racial tension is high between the invading whites and the local tribal aborigines, who they are intent on culling. Beautifully shot against the outback, desert, sunsets and night skies are filled with nicks haunting musical interludes. The whole thing flows like a sandstorm until the sweary, blood red ending. You get a sense that you've been with the characters longer than the hour and a half length as so much brutal pain and violence is crammed in next to the amazing visuals and bed seed-esqe songs. This being nicks first screenplay I hope that there may be more because whatever is music's loss is definitely cinemas gain.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A beautiful Aussie film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Set in the Australian outback 19th century, The Proposition is one of the many recent slew of brilliant Australian films. Directed by Nick Cave, this film features some stunning scenery, brilliant acting and a fine story.Captain Stanley (Ray Winstone) and his men capture two of the four Burns brothers, Charlie (Guy Pearce) and Mike. Their gang is held responsible for attacking the Hopkins farm, raping pregnant Mrs. Hopkins and murdering the whole family. Captain Stanley's proposition to Charlie is to gain pardon and, more importantly, save his younger brother Mike from the gallows by finding and killing Arthur (Danny Huston) within nine days.This movie is one of the best Australian films. It looks beautiful and features moving and terrific performances by Guy Pearce, Ray Winstone, Emily Watson, David Wenham, David Gulpilil and John Hurt. The story is well made and the themes of the story (family, loyal and betrayal) are tied in and done extremely well.The major qualm I have with this movie is that at time, it can be very slow, which is annoying because this really is a great film.4/5.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first thing that appealed to me about this movie was the fact it was a UK/Australian production and the cast looked fantastic on watching the movie i was not disappointed.The film was very authentic and real (sometimes unsettlingly real)and the thing that makes this so apparent is the characters. There are no good guys and bad guys as such just people surviving in a harsh land every character has a light and a dark side but most rely heavily on the dark side of there personalities.Ray Winstone plays the troubled Captain very well and i was pleasantly surprised at Guy Pierce's excellent Irish accent. The rest of the cast did a very good job and added to the authenticity and the harsh backdrop.The movie, at times is bloody and graphic and the final scene's are hard to watch but very necessary to the story, you never feel as if it is gratuitous violence.The film has some haunting moments and and the soundtrack is used wonderfully as is the occasional voice over. Nick cave has done a brilliant job with the script and i'll look forward to seeing more of his work.I fully recommend this film it might not be to everyones taste but i fail to see how someone could dislike this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Home, Home in the Outback</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tagged by many reviewers as an 'Australian Western', John Hillcoat's 'The Proposition' does indeed borrow a great deal from the stock-characters and iconography of that genre ? chief amongst these being the conflicted lawman at odds with his civic masters, the vengeful outlaw clan, and the bleak, forbidding landscape. It also borrows the romantic nihilism which has pervaded the Western for the past two decades: no matter what codes of conduct, personal or private, the heroes and villains may support, all are defeated by a brutalised world and sense of self.The script is generally sound, though Nick Cave does occasionally lapse into incongruous lyricism ("Australia?What fresh hell is this?"), which jars somewhat with the generally colloquial tone of the piece. This is a minor complaint, though, more than made up for by the quite astonishing Australian landscapes.Ray Winstone gives his best performance since 'The War Zone' as the township Captain of Police charged with the task of apprehending the Burns Gang. As ever, despite his usual hard-man persona being employed to full effect, he is at his best in more reflective mode ? a man determined to civilise his community (and himself) by whatever means necessary, but sorrowfully aware that the brutal instruments of that process may damage him. His is the only fully rounded, believable male character in the piece. By comparison Guy Pearce has a less challenging role ? the villain-confronting-his-past. We can empathise, in the most general terms, with his plight ? forced to betray and murder a bad brother to save a (presumably) good one, but we are given so little detail as to his complicity (or otherwise) in his sibling's past crimes that it is difficult to sympathise with him. Danny Huston, as Pearce's erudite but brutal bandit brother (a million miles from his lecherous civil servant in 'The Constant Gardner'), has comparatively little to work with in the script, and his role is very much a theatrical contrivance, but has a genuine sense of presence on screen.A striking, engaging, occasionally poetic, but ultimately bleak film. Well worth a look.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"I want you to kill your brother."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Here's an Australian Western steeped deeply in marinara and done in the tradition of the sleaziest of the spaghetti genre. It's a gritty, violent, and truth be told, fly infested film that sears your viewing pleasure in a visceral display of blood and guts that will leave you as squeamish as it's victims. It even throws in a little Darwinian Theory for those in a scientific mood, while vast expanses of dusty, yellow desert landscapes play havoc with your vision throughout. It's not the easiest of films to watch, and while the real villains of the piece, David Wenham's Fletcher, John Hurt's Lamb, Danny Huston's Arthur, get their due, so does just about everyone else, innocent or otherwise. The ending in fact could have gone either way, and I was fully expecting Guy Pearce's Charlie Burns to blow his brains out in response to his brother's question - "What are you going to do now"? Had he put Arthur out of his misery, that would have been the way to go, an alternate ending perhaps even more powerful than the real one. I give it marks for stepping outside the traditional Western box, but weak stomachs be advised, there's no Butch and Sundance dialog here to ease the way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Blood stained poetry</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In one scene late in this movie one of the characters holds a piece of jewellery in front of his eyes. He turns it round slowly, watching the light reflecting off its multi-angled surface and softly claims to have never seen anything so beautiful. Seconds later, he has grabbed the owner, forced her down on a table and is threatening to rape her at gunpoint, the collision between beauty and ugly, disgusting violence being indicative of the experience provided by The Proposition.This, for want of a better phrase, is not an easy film to watch. Set in the outback of Australia in 1880, it plays with genre staples like sweeping shots of the desert that take in it's desolate splendour, slow paced reflections that recall the Spaghetti Westerns of Sergio Leone and taut, vicious moments of brutality and pain. There is a truly unsettling moment at the midway point when a young man is dragged screaming before a lynch mob and flogged repeatedly and as such, the film is both a lustful yearning for the romanticism associated with the wilderness, but also a damning illustration of colonialism and how the West was won. Only this time, it's not the West at all, but the East.Guy Pearce as lead character Charlie Burns has garnered plenty of praise for his role but in truth, the real focus of the story is on Ray Winstone's performance as Captain Stanley. As the leader of the local police force, Stanley is a conflicted man. He is determined to civilise this land but isn't afraid to use underhanded means to achieve it resulting in the unresolvable moral dilemma when he sends Burns to kill one brother in order to save another. Furthermore, he has the unenviable task of sheltering his innocent wife from the reality of their situation, a task which is testing him to breaking point and driving a wedge through their marriage. In conveying all this Winstone is never less than captivating. He is full of pride and resolve but is let down by the fact his London morals do not apply in this insane lawless land and he deserves as much adulation as possible for his portrayal of wounded male pride.His is not the only notable performance though. John Hurt puts in a brief but scene stealing turn as Jellon Lamb, a pessimistic bounty hunter as well read as he is drunk, while Danny Huston hangs over the proceedings like a demonic spectre. His dark charisma is enough to seduce his brother Charlie back into his gang and his intelligence is only matched by his ruthlessness, a trait that sees him discussing poetry with dying men before torturing them with knives.It isn't perfect of course, no film ever is and some audiences may find the achingly slow pace galling. Plus, with all the depth and characterisation in abundance, its a shame there wasn't any left over for David "Faramir" Wenham as the stuffed shirt Englishman in charge of the town, a stereotype who seems to have fallen out of another movie.That said though, this is still a hugely rewarding film. An immediate comparison would be Cronenberg's A History of Violence with its themes of violence, redemption and moral indecision but The Proposition is arguably the better of the two. Hopefully it'll find a larger audience on DVD and while it might be a bit too uncomfortable to watch for some, there'll still be those who revel in its dark imagery.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was recommended THE PROPOSITION by a few people on the horror board - and I gotta say it was a good recommendation. There were a few problems that I had with it that I'll mention later - but overall this is a beautifully filmed, well-acted, and violent tale of family, loyalty, and revenge...Set in colonial Australia, THE PROPOSITION tells the tale of Charlie Burns, who is enlisted by the local constabulary to find and kill Charlie's older brother who is wanted in connection with the rape and murder of a local woman. The lawman takes Charlie's younger brother as "collateral" until the deed is done. At this point, Charlie must decide which bond is stronger, the one with his younger or older brother...The camera-work, settings, and acting are all top-notch in this film. It's a bit of a slow-burner, but there are some scenes of explosive violence, and the story unravels at a decent pace. There were a few things that I took issue with - most of which deals with how the incident involving the death of the local woman was presented. There's very little background given on what actually happened and how Charlie and his brothers may have been involved, which made it kinda hard for me to sympathize with either the local law or with the Burns clan. The vagueness of the situation knocked it down a bit in my book. I feel that there could have also been a bit more background give on the Burns gang itself, as it seemed as though their back-story may have been interesting - but this wasn't expanded on either. Regardless, THE PROPOSITION is a strong film that I'd recommend for drama/revenge fans...8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A philosophical western courtesy of Nick Cave certainly revives the gritty western genre to an extent and is a welcome addition in a movie era where westerns continually disappoint.It's a realistic, blood drenched look at an uncivilized Australian era where an idealistic lawman convinces an outlaw to kill his brother who's an even more human stain. All this escalates and much blood and violence ensues before it concludes with everyone involved either dead or emotionally scarred for life.Deliberately paced and filled with jarring images of violence and dread, The Proposition is not easily forgotten and it makes an impact. The script is well written by Cave, takes no shortcuts and doesn't sugarcoat the violent era it's portraying. I wouldn't say I enjoyed the film very much, didn't always get the philosophical mumbling but in the end the film makes you think and you won't forget it for a while.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A stupendous movie of grand, poetic proportions</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The relentless Australian landscape becomes the central character in the movie, and plays its major role by sapping humanity from its inhabitants. Flies, present from the beginning, seem to become omnipresent - perhaps representing the decay of social order.Ray Winstone is magnificent as Captain Stanley - a fearsome man in a fearsome environment, who nevertheless is intent on maintaining a semblance of order and hard-to-hold humanity. Though fearsome and flawed, Captain Stanley has a goal of "rightness," which holds to true north the moral compass of the story. His and his wife Martha'sloving relationship, and their pact to maintain a civil standard amidst the most exigent circumstances, provide silver threads (tho' at times tarnished) of hope for mankind. Emily Watson is excellent as seemingly pristine Martha, and though flawed, as is he, she is believable as his compassionate retreat. I am not fond of violence in movies, and must admit to hiding my eyes during parts of this film. The violence, however, is not gratuitous. It is an inevitable aspect of that bleak world, and is a necessary evil. Stunning cinematography depicts a land that is violent by definition, poetic in its twisted, barren beauty. This is not a pleasant movie. It is, however, a stupendous one. Initially I didn't want to see it. I am very glad I did. Violence is not the main memory I retain of this film. More, I remember the Captain's and Martha's love in the face of gritty desperation, and beyond that, even more memorable is the ultimate triumph of human spirit. It is a parable of Existence itself.I will be surprised and disappointed if it isn't nominated for the American Academy Awards in 2007.</fullReview>

The sight of the Australian outback is one that has never been captured so dismal and so harsh. The viewer feels the pain of the heat and the flies and how nature's elements can be overpowering as well as overwhelming. The outback controls this film as well as the characters. Western film rarely if ever has brought me to a place so dangerous and so haunting. Nick Cave has created a masterpiece and John Hillcoat brought it to life with his actors shinning ever so bright. The performances transcended ever so beautifully. Those with a soft stomach should stay far away and those who dare watch this film are traveling to a dangerously dark place.

		<fullReview>Written by musician Nick Cave, "The Proposition" is an unflinching look at brutality in the Australian wilderness during British colonization. Captain Stanley (Ray Winstone) is on a mission to bring order to the wilderness. As part of this mission, he is determined to track down the vicious outlaw and murderer Arthur Burns (Danny Huston). To do so, he convinces Arthur's brother Charlie (Guy Pearce) to track down Arthur in exchange for the life of the Burns family's youngest son (Richard Wilson).Captain Stanley's plan, of course, goes awry even as he tries to shield his proper wife (Emily Watson) from the unyielding violence of their environment. The movie is close in tone to Cormac McCarthy's "Blood Meridian." Yet, thankfully, "The Proposition" promises and finds mankind capable of redemption. Depending on your outlook, you will either find the ending a cop out or a thankful affirmation that mankind unrestricted is not solely ruled by Darwinian impulses. Order and redemption are possible.The performances are uniformly excellent and the direction by John Hillcoat is accomplished. Ray Winstone as Captian Stanley brilliantly portrays a lawman grappling with his conscience as he tries to bring justice to the wilderness. Will likely be the year's best performance. The always excellent John Hurt is fantastic as an unscrupulous, driven bounty hunter.Be forewarned, though, this movie is truly brutal. It is not enjoyable and I would caution against viewing the film. It is unrelentingly brutal and incredibly tense.Recommended, but it definitely contains an NC-17 level of violence. Of course, the movie is rated R. If a movie features more than a few seconds of male nudity or realistic sex scenes, it is given an NC-17. Unrelenting violence like the kind featured in "The Passion," "Munich," and "Saving Private Ryan" earns an R rating. This sort of double standard renders ratings practically useless. Content description is truly the best way for adults to gauge the suitability of movies for their particular sensibilities.Read more reviews at http://solipsisticblog.blogspot.com/.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>this movie is amazing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>i haven't felt this good leaving a theatre in a long time. john hillcoat and nick cave teamed up remarkably well on this film. the story is so gritty and so ugly yet the film itself comes off beautiful. simple shots of nature are so soothing in the picture, then an act of violence will pull you out of it and make you realize the horror the characters are going through. i kept hearing how violent this film was but the criticisms against it are not warranted. i think the problem people have with the violence in this film is that we see the characters with their families and we see the painful decisions they have to make that lead to violence. without a doubt, the driving force of this film is family and the loyalty one has to it. this is a worthy addition to the classic westerns we've seen through the years and one of the best pictures I've seen in awhile.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Really great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film was very gruesome, unrelenting, but authentic to the setting in Australia a hundred years ago. This was in contrast to the barely audible poetry in the background, a beautiful piece of artistry. The violence was necessary, to show Arthur Burns as a monster, a necessary motive for Charlie to kill him in the end and save the Stanleys. Emily Watson portrayed the one civilizing influence in the town with dignity and grace. Everyone else was a postmodern stone age drifter. John Hurt was his usual brilliant self. The beautiful Australian Outback sunsets contrasted well with all the ugly rotten teeth. There was not one logic hole to be found, something worth a great vote in itself, being so rare.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Echoes of Ford, Peckinpah, Leone, &amp; Eastwood - the best Western since "Unforgiven"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Echoes of Ford, Peckinpah, Leone, &amp; Eastwood - the best Western since "Unforgiven"Musician Nick Cave has crafted a basic meat - and - potatoes screenplay for this unapologetically brutal morality Western fable set in the grimy arid No Man's Land of the Australian Outback circa the 1880s focusing on the titular offering given by lawman Captain Stanley (the always excellent Winstone) to captured outlaw Charlie Burns (ditto Pearce): his prisoner can get off from the crimes charged of murder and rape in exchange for either of his gang's brothers, the cold-blooded Arthur (a chillingly good Huston, a chip off the old master, his father, John's shoulder), his eldest, or his feeble-minded younger brother Mikey (Wilson) also in stir who will be hung on Christmas Day if Charlie fails to materialize with Arthur in the five allotted days to trek the wilderness for his sinister sibling.With its basic trappings of redemption and being torn between family bonds and self-preservation Cave, a relative novice to the art of screen writing, concocts a taut, no-holds barred hard look at the unspoken truths of the old West, namely duty, honor and courage which have been abandoned for greed, self-destruction and destiny. His characters are all at a stalemate deciding on their fates. Captain Stanley is a drunk whose passion for the military has been compromised by his faith in his wife Martha (an equally good Watson) who demands justice for her beloved friend, the victim of the crimes committed. Meanwhile Stanley's cowardly vulgar squad has ill-will and contempt for the impotent leader and to make matters worse the dust-choked village's official, Eden Fletcher (Wenham, a well-coifed weasel) is hell-bent on punishing the imprisoned Mikey by forcing his indecisive jailer to lash him 100 times with a cat-o-nine tails.Kudos to the make-up by Sally Gordon and her crew for the unsettling bloodiness; Jill Eden and Margot Wilson's perfect set decorations and costume designs respectively; Chris Kennedy's grotty production design; the evocative cinematography of Benoit Delhomme; razor-sharped jolting editing by Jon Gregory and Ian Seymour and finally Cave doing double duty with his eerie soundtrack collaboration with Warren Ellis (including an unnerving piano tinkling of "Jesus Loves Me").Director Hillcoat (who collaborated with Cave once before in 1988's "Ghosts?of the Civil War" of which I am unfamiliar with at all) effectively depicts the harsh realities of the Old West with its fly heavy, grimy and murderously hot environs reflecting the evils of its good and bad guys and the common ground they all understand: one man for himself. With echoes of past oater auteurs Ford for his scope, Peckinpah for the all-too-realistic graphic violence (and there's some humdingers sprinkled liberally throughout; the squeamish have been warned!); Leone for his vision and Eastwood for his themes of a Man With No Name vanquishing the status quo. This is the best Western since the latter's neo-genre classic "Unforgiven".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cave &amp; Hilcoat craft a brilliant character piece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first watched this movie, I did not like it - at least as a western. The plot seemed all too predictable and there were characters like those played by David Wenham and Emily Watson that seemed all too unnecessary. I then took a step back and realized what a marvelous film this was.The film has interesting pacing. Cave and Hilcoat waste no time in cutting to the chase. There is a shootout with Charlie and Mikey Burns. Captain Stanley, played beautifully by Ray Winstone, offers Charlie the proposition in question: kill his brother Arthur Burns by Christmas, or Mikey dies. This is the setup for what turns out to be more a character piece than a standard action or western movie. The two main players are Captain Stanley and Charlie Burns.Stanley has made a deal with Charlie and feels that if Mikey dies, he and his wife's lives are at stake. This is where Winstone plays the character so well. We see him turn from a character who will "civilize this place" to a paranoid, nervous failure. I particularly love the scene where he stands outside the jail wielding a gun threatening to shoot anyone who lays and hand on Mikey and then yielding to his wife. This scene is a far cry from the Stanley we see in the beginning.Charlie's struggle is different. He too yields to family. He has a clear chance to kill Arthur and doesn't. His reasoning is not out of fear, but out of the fact that Arthur is family. The scene where they sit gazing at the sunset is poignant as it shows they have a bond - however weak it may have become. Their discussion is brief, while providing a subtle statement about their relationship.I questioned the ending at first, and then realized it worked on a number of levels. We must remember that the writer is Nick Cave - and while his writing can be direct and violent, there is also a tendency to be subtle and symbolic. Stanley is a self concerned man, planning to show that he can clean up the land by bringing in a dangerous criminal. Later, he is concerned only for the life of he and his wife. He is not concerned at all with Charlie and Mikey really.Charlie on the other hand questions what he should do. He ultimately makes the decision ****spoiler******* to kill Arthur as Arthur attempts to murder Capt. Stanley and his wife. Yet even though Mikey has died, Charlie does not proceed to stake revenge on Stanley. It's not the way Charlie does things. In spite of being a criminal, we see by this that he does not believe in vengeance or torture and kills Arthur because of this - not for any other reason.This is a sharp contrast to what Wenham's character does as he has Mikey flogged. People watch on like it is a show - they embrace the violent torture. They handle human life like entertainment. Wenham has Mikey flogged, we can guess, to spite Stanley as Stanley has overstepped his authority. So precious life is in the old outback.So what is this movie in the end? It's a good start for cave as a screenwriter. It looks great. I'm not an expert on Australia, so I don't know what to say about the authenticity, but there are shots in here that create a feeling of desolation, heat, and emptiness. I particularly love the flies....I think if viewers pay attention to some of the characterizations, they may appreciate this more. I read some viewers didn't like the characters, feeling they were too empty. Well for some, that was the point I think Cave wanted to make. Furthermore, this movie takes to task the definition of "justice," as for some it holds different meaning. Among the principle characters in this piece, that meaning ultimately results in their downfall.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Warts-and-All Western Omelete from the Outback</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The brilliant, piercing anger of THE PROPOSITION comes from an irreconcilable conflict. What is more important: family ties, marriage vows, or the larger society? Ray Winstone is a captain intending to civilize an Australian outpost with harsh British justice. The Aborigines have a policy that if we kill one of their people, they'll kill one of ours. That policy drives the local politician David Wenham a bit bonkers. So Wenham takes an action that completely upsets the small town applecart. By pitting brother against brother, wife against husband and natives against the colonial invader, THE PROPOSITION manages to shake the mold off of well-worn Western clichés. Using aboriginal "dream-time" to unsettle the familiar Western narrative, THE PROPOSITION proves to be a spaghetti Western without irony. While it is impossible to build a Western town that doesn't look like a Hollywood back lot, this movie piles on the flies, kicks up the dust and displays the worst dental work in recent memory. KING KONG tried to make a setting sun profound; THE PROPOSITION actually pulls it off. Emily Watson delivers yet another impeccable performance. Watson has flawless porcelain skin and the best baby blues in the business. Winstone tries to protect Watson from the worst consequences of his decisions; instead, he puts her right into the cross-hairs. When all hell breaks loose it actually means something. Precious few films can claim that distinction. There are no heroes in THE PROPOSITION, but, at the end, there is a heroic moment. With its adult sensibility, fine ensemble cast and buckshot swatches of wisdom, THE PROPOSITON transcends the genre and hits the bullseye!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Australian Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I expected quite a lot from this movie, and got even more than that. My family also came from faraway shores and settled among the gumtrees of inland Australia. The striking beauty of the landscape that is so well captured in this movie looks very similar to the view from my window. Although more than a century has passed since the time depicted in the movie, we are still a bunch of white people trying to tame this harsh land and each of us brings a little piece of our old mother Europe with us, reminiscent of Mrs Stanley's rose garden, a tiniest of foreign specks in the vast brown land. The slowness of the movie reflects the slowness of all life in the searing heat, the omnipresent dust and all-pervasive flies. The inner sanctum of the movie deals with human nature, its ruthless savageness and its trembling reaching out for the ever-illusive beauty and kindness. Ferocious and resplendent, fulfilling and unsettling, monotonous and exciting, this movie soars high above what passes for ambitious cinema of today, and is certainly going to be more and more appreciated with every passing decade, like the finest of Australian shiraz wines.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>violent, art western from Down Under</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Proposition" is a grim, atmospheric western set not on the American frontier but rather in the Australian outback of the 1880's.Captain Stanley (Ray Winstone) is a police officer sent from England to impose law and order on the largely uncivilized populace inhabiting that newly settled region of the world (his jurisdiction includes aborigine natives as well as the recently arrived whites). Those orders set Stanley in direct opposition to the Burns Gang, a notorious band of thieves and cutthroats comprised of three Irish brothers who are suspected in the rape and murder of one of the most prominent and influential families in the territory. After Stanley captures two of the men, he imprisons one - the weak, sniveling Mikey - and frees the other, Charlie (Guy Pearce), threatening to hang Mikey if Charlie fails to hunt down and kill the third brother, Arthur, purported to be the vile ringleader of the group. Thus is sent into motion a brutal, violent tale of revenge and justice that soaks the exquisite Australian landscape in generous helpings of blood and gore."The Proposition" is not for the faint of heart or weak of stomach, as it literally rubs our noses in the violence it is portraying. In vivid, unflinching detail, the movie captures the inhumanity and bloodshed perpetrated by the characters on one another throughout the course of the story. Stanley is an unlikely central figure for the tale, since even though he begins as a hardnosed, unyielding stickler for law and order, he turns out, in the long run, to be one of the most reasoned and restrained players in the drama. In fact, he faces intense opposition from the townsfolk for being too lenient with his prisoners and too slow in exacting justice for the horrible crimes committed. Stanley, who is also deeply devoted to his loving wife, stands as a kind of transitional figure linking the barbarous past with the hopefully more "civilized" future of this continent uniquely tucked away in its own little corner of the world.The second major character is Charlie, who has to decide between betraying his older brother by killing him in cold blood or letting his younger brother swing at the end of a rope if he doesn't. Unfortunately, Charlie is not nearly as fully developed a character as Stanley is, nor is his moral dilemma as clearly developed or dramatized either. We don't get the sense that we know much about Charlie even after we have spent quite a bit of time with him which is a shame since his thought processes and actions are pivotal to understanding the outcome of the story. Perhaps more successful is the portrayal of Stanley's wife, Martha (Emily Watson), who is torn between her innate compassion for humanity and her desire to have her dear friend's death avenged by the public execution of the men responsible for the heinous crime.What distinguishes "The Proposition" from so many other westerns is its deliberate moral ambiguity, its recognition that people don't always fit into nicely wrapped packages of good and evil, and that fairness and justice are not always the clear-cut commodities we've been taught to believe they are from literature and movies. And all this is done against a stark natural landscape that stands as a mute, indifferent witness to the insanity of the humans' actions.Pearce, Watson and, especially, Winstone deliver remarkably restrained, understated performances as the three main characters caught up in the drama. After all, with all the blood and carnage up there on the screen, the last thing the film needs is a bunch of over-emoting actors adding to the excess of it all."The Proposition" is clearly not for everyone, but die-hard Western aficionados would be remiss in not seeing it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just as good as any of the Oscar nominees this year</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Proposition is a bloody tale of vengeance in the Austrilian outback. The opening scene has an excellent shootout, filling your head with the sounds of a realistic gunfight. Then, when the two younger brothers are captured, and the younger's nose is broken, the sound of dripping blood seems all to realistic, causing your stomach to churn. However, if that hasn't convinced you that you are in for an experience of a movie, then captain Staley's monolouge will do just that. The final scene is great. The acting is great. The cinematography is great. Everything about the film seems to be almost perfect, save for an underutilized Guy Peirce, and some slow scenes with the captain and his wife. The movie is not for everybody. The gore if the film may certainly turn off the squamish. A boy is flogged, men are shot and decapitated graphicly, a woman almost raped, and the landscape painted is an unforgiving one. It does slow down at times, and is likely to bore some of the younger or more impatient viewers. However, I think that many when they watch it will be caught up in the storytelling and scenery, to enraptured to notice the films flaws. At least on the first viewing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Propositon</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stunning film from director John Hillcoat and writer Nick Cave, set in Australia during the on-coming British Colonial occupation as Captain Stanley(Ray Winstone)offers Charlie Burns(Guy Pearce) a proposition..if he wants his young fourteen year old simple-minded brother to remain alive he'll have to kill his psychopathic brother Arthur(Danny Huston)who had recently slaughtered an entire family capping that off by the rape and murder of the pregnant mother of said family. His associates are Samuel Stoat(Tom Budge)and Two Bob(Tommy Lewis), both look at him as their leader..this is one happy family of murderers who Stanley, and his town, want dead. Stanley is not respected by the men who work under him or by his wealthy boss, Eden Fletcher(David Wenham). When Charlie sets off on his mission he notices several who are dead thanks to the spear-killings from aboriginals hidden within an Outback where those who have always been there know the right places to hide. He also encounters a colorful,lying bounty hunter named Jellon Lamb(John Hurt).Almost dying from a spear attack, Charlie is rescued by his brother Arthur when the dilemma put before him kicks in. If he wants his mentally-troubled brother Mikey alive, he'll have to shoot Arthur and the film opens opportunities to do just that. When Fletcher orders Stanley to have Mikey flogged with 100 lashes, the film shows that the Captain's troubles may just be beginning. Stanley has a wife named Martha(Emily Warson)who he loves with all his heart. Their marriage is tender and warm..Stanley fears deep inside that harm will come their way, but he earnestly believes that Charlie will do the right thing, but knowing that Mikey received truly horrifying whipping slashes will always haunt him with open possibilities of payback.The film is grim, bloody, grisly, and uncompromising. Arthur and his gang are at one moment seemingly harmless looking at their inherited sun-piercing land with poetic awe and the next decapitating heads and slicing torsos with large knives. But, the film also shows the sadistic side of colonials in the example of Fletcher who watches without a whiff of repulsion as Mikey's torn back is soaking the whip and ground with blood. Where does it end? Can law &amp; order, humanity &amp; love, exist in such a harsh environment where the sun pierces the flesh with it's rays, people who inhabit the little town look as if they have barely seen water, bodies are frail and hair is caked with dirt and dust. The Outback, like it is often portrayed in film, can look simply jaw-droppingly beautiful at one moment and a beast of heated hate the next.The performances are superb from top to bottom. Pearce and Huston say so much without even speaking. There's this quiet torment festering inside Charlie because of what his brothers and friends have done. The killing isn't glorified here, and is seen as cruel and unnecessary. In a way, the Stanleys are our only gaze at humanity and they arrived here by command to live the best way they can. Their tenderness is the only truly hopeful thing we can gage in such a truly hard-bitten wasteland of rage.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A "Proposition" worth accepting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For decades, the western was one of Hollywood's most dependable genres. A western was always expected to deliver action, sometimes romance, a morality story, and most times, you could always tell the good from the bad. The Propostion, a western set in the Australian Outback, follows the model that has been in vogue in more recent westerns to approach the old standby with a different tack, taking our expectations about a western and turning them on their ear. But the Proposition is much more than even that, it is a tale that examines ideas including love, loyalty and the very idea that a world that is uncivilized by nature can ever be otherwise. It is a tale that is mesmerizing and haunting, and some of it's images may be difficult to shake off so quickly.The film opens with Captain Stanley (Ray Winstone), the local law, having captured two thirds of the murderous Burns gang, brothers Charlie (Guy Pearce) and 14 year old Mikey (Richard Wilson). They are responsible for the rape and slaughter of a local family, but Stanley knows that the real killer of the group is still free, eldest brother Arthur (Danny Huston). So, he offers Charlie a proposition: he will let him go and give him nine days, until Christmas, to find and kill his brother before Stanley hangs Mikey. Charlie, desperate to save his childlike younger brother, accepts the deal and sets out in search of Arthur.Stanley's is not able to completely hide his deal with Charlie, and is quickly under pressure from the local town power, Eden Fletcher (David Wenham) and his own, wife, Martha (Emily Watson), who was friends with the murdered family, to bring the younger boy to justice quickly and then make sure both Charlie and Arthur are killed also. There has also been sightings of "rebel" aborigines nearby that Fletcher wants dealt with, and Martha is desperate to ensure that the upcoming Christmas dinner does not get put off.The Proposition is a film that fails to look at anything with a completely black and white attitude. The people in the story on both sides are good and bad, some leaning one way more than others, but they all possess the attributes of both sides of the equation. Captain Stanley is a believer in the law, and has a desire to "civilize" the territory, but even he knows that there are all sides to a story, and that bringing young Mikey to justice will not stop the real evil, and he questions whether Mikey is even capable of having committed such an act, as he cowers in the corner of the cell at the slightest movement of the guards.It touches on issues of brotherly love, as Charlie reunites with Arthur, and wants to save Mikey, and knows that Arthur has gone too far in his brutal activities, but Charlie simply cannot bring himself to pull the hammer on another brother. The side story with Martha, trying to assemble her Christmas dinner, living in a house surrounded by a well-maintained garden, is one element of a greater message contained in The Proposition, the idea that this is a world that cannot be "civilized" and that they are tilting at windmills, clinging to a concept that simply will not take hold in this brutal, barren landscape, and perhaps even, it shouldn't. When Captain Stanley dismisses one of his servants, a local aborigine, he removes his shoes before leaving, returning to the world that is, abandoning a dream that is only contained in this one little space on the map.The Proposition is bathed in the color red, both from blood and the plains illuminated by the sun. The cinematography is impressive, capturing the harsh, stark world these individuals live in. As with many other modern westerns, it also doesn't shy away from the more unsavory elements of the time and place. Every character is dirty and unkempt, right down to their teeth, and the omnipresent flies cover people everywhere, living and dead.The actor's all do an accomplished job. Pearce is short on words, but has plenty of presence. Stanley, trapped by circumstance and also his conscience, is portrayed by Winstone as a man with a constant headache, swallowing power for it often, and also desperate to attempt to keep his from the unpleasant aspects of the world he inhabits. Huston gives Arthur the necessary wild edge, but he is also a thoughtful character, able to stop and marvel at the beauty of the world around him. Watson portrays Martha as a woman trying desperately to hold on to some semblance of the world she is familiar with, but also not afraid to occasionally look into her husband's darker world.The Proposition is a film that doesn't offer up any easy resolutions to what transpires on screen. However, it is worth the effort to watch if you like your drama not so cut and dry. It is a harsh tale about harsh men living in a harsh time, and knows that everything cannot be wrapped up so easily. As one character says to the other late in the film "So, what are you going to do now?" If that isn't a comment on any of our lives at many moments, what is?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Powerful, artistic but too violent.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this film today with a friend who had a dual reason for going, seeing Guy Pearce again whom we both love, and because Nick Cave wrote the script and choose the music. For me, a 60 year old woman, it took courage to attend knowing what I would in-for violence-wise. A bit more character development of the Burns brothers would have been of benefit and the violence toned-down would have helped, at least from this woman's perspective.I thought Ray Winstone had a very challenging role as he was a caring man, foolhardy in obvious ways, but still one who was behind violence acts against the aborigines and against criminals. I felt that the movie had some Shakespearian tragedy aspects to it, and that the there was even a Christ figure, but I don't want to say more because of ruining the storyline for others. Shakespeare has had officers of the law being like buffoons and this definitely had that happening in some segments.This is the kind of movie that I liked a lot, but it was too distressing at so many places to watch again. So, I am glad that I saw the movie in a theater, but for me, I couldn't recommend the movie to anyone unless they are prepared for heavy sometimes gory violence. I did feel it was gratuitous in some places. I like the word "visceral" to describe the movie, as a reviewer here stated, as I could feel the movie physically after sitting through it. It left me shaken. Guy Pearce did not disappoint, nor did Emily Watson, like a beautiful flower against the dusty barren countryside, and Danny Huston, I finally liked him in a role in this film. The acting was all great; oh, not to forget the inimitable, John Hurt, again Shakespearian in his delivery. Oh yes, the heavy irony of the juxtapositions of patriotism with massacre, and the civility of the sheriff's home life, sensitive wife, and tender feelings with the gritty ruthless violence rampant in Australia at that time.

		<fullReview>So much violence. And none of this pretty, stylised violence Hollywood gives us. This was realistic, and gory. The acting was fantastic, and even David Wenham, who was a little over the top with his English iciness, was wonderful.There were no pure characters, just varying shades of grey. The redeemable characters are left in a reasonably terrible state. Just so wonderfully Nick Cave. The settings are spectacular, just awe-inspiring, and the overwhelming grit of the film is perfect.There are no buff, pretty people here. Everyone is filthy, literally. Skinny, or bloated, blood covered, and real looking.The soundtrack is eerily pretty, and I am so going to be buying it.If you see one Australian film this year, make it "The Proposition".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A beautifully crafted film, making superb use of the landscape. Too many people have already exhaustively detailed the plot, so suffice to say that Guy Pearce and Ray Winstone's characters play out their drama of justice in concert with various other interplayed 'stories'. For instance the obvious love, but also obvious unfulfillment of the Stanleys' marriage, the complex relationship of the three brothers, the killing of Gulpilil's character by the Tommy Lewis character-a denouement subtly suggested by the other aboriginal actors's characters drinking while observing their fellows being captured and abused. Personally, I found it extremely refreshing to see complexity and difference being utilised in aboriginal characters. No simplistic Noble Savage stuff here. The Tommy Lewis character was a small gem to my mind, a man angry and disillusioned but nevertheless a warrior of sorts , and able to distill wisdom from two cultures also. Presumably that was what one commenter was objecting too, that such a man could be self-taught, as was Arthur Burns.Also I find it hard to understand some comments about David Wenham's portrayal- this was not a caricature or naive melodramatic reading , but a portrait of a cynical and declasse expatriot, who knew very well how to play the fop to deliberately annoy and distance himself. Note his his insolent use of "Martha" instead of the polite "Mrs Stanley " for instance. Hard too to understand why Guy Pearce's performance was called 'wooden' or 'emotionless' , personally, I think it was an excellent portrayal of a tortured man. Nor was he any hero, but as violent as his brother - but without the sadism.The ending was perfect- did he or didn't he ........</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A good, film with a simple plot and outstanding performances. However, it's more Pom than Oz.Not since the days of Weird Mob,Walkabout and Wake in Fright have the Poms and Euros been so dominant. They do know how to film this wonderfully diverse land though.Winstone and Watson have more screen time than any of our actors (I know they're meant to be English. But any number of our excellent actors could have done these roles) and do a great job. I wouldn't be surprised to see them get top billing overseas. Pearce gives his usual charismatic performance with much brooding and little dialogue to work with. I would have liked to see more of him. All of the other cast members give memorable performances-Morgan, Wilson, etc.Even though I think it's a good film, I wouldn't class it as great. I thought "Jimmy Blacksmith" was better,particularly Schepisi's direction. While the violence was very graphic in "Proposition", Schepisi could come at it from a different angle. For example, when a woman is about to be axed to death he would cut to an egg falling off a table and cracking. A lot more subtle but just as effective.It's so good to be somersaulting into a much better year this year and seeing so many entertaining films featuring our talented actors.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Powerful and Brutal</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not a film for the fainthearted, The Proposition (Directed by John Hillcoat; Written by Nick Cave) peels back the layers of revisionist history and gives us an unsettling look at the brutality of nineteenth century Australia. A self-styled "Australian Western," this is essentially a bush ranger film, set in the 1880s, but these madmen make Heath Ledger's Ned Kelly look like a pansy! There isn't a bad performance here, and Nick Cave's music is suitably haunting. Guy Pearce (pictured left) is Charlie Burns the bush ranger tracking down his homicidal rapist brother Arthur (Danny Huston). Charlie has accepted a proposition from the local policeman, Captain Stanley (Ray Winstone) - if he kills his older brother he and his younger brother can escape the gallows. Eventually he finds his brother and "will he or won't he kill him?" is the question that keeps the audience going. Stanley and his wife (Emma Watson) seek desperately to "civilize" this savage country. They want to replicate England as best they can, steadfastly refusing to come to terms with, or seek to understand, the hostile wilderness that surrounds their little island of a frontier town. The visual cues to this are fascinating to watch for. Mrs. Stanley has roses, that most English of plants, growing in her front yard. The fence around their homestead is a white picket fence (though the cross bars are rough-hewn Australian gum, an interesting juxtaposition of old and new world materials). A portrait of the Queen dominates their dining room. They open a box of Christmas decorations including white cotton "snow" and they sit down on Christmas Day to carve a hot roast dinner, though it's probably 100 degrees in the shade outside. During this Christmas meal they are brutalised by Arthur, the mad Irish bush ranger, who wraps his victim's bashed and bleeding head in the union jack. Here in this climactic (and difficult to watch) scene, Charlie must make his decision - does he intervene and take his brother out or will family ties prove too strong? Indigenous people fare quite well in this film. There are certainly depictions of subjugation, humiliation, brutality and race hatred ("What is an Irishman?" asks deranged bounty hunter Jellon Lamb (John Hurt) but a *igger turned inside out?") But at the same time, the Aborigines are a force to be reckoned with. Somewhat like a John Ford western where the Indians are almost a force of nature inhabiting the landscape like the the rocks and the desert sands of Monument Valley, the Aboriginal people of this film are a constant threat to those who dare to walk into their country (beautifully shot by the way). They are skilled warriors, they are dangerous, they know the territory in a way that white people could never hope to know it, and if you wander onto their turf, you might at any time find yourself fatally speared when you least expect it. Giving the Indigenous people the upper hand in their own country works well in establishing their dignity and self-reliance. Two other scenes work in a similar way. One of Arthur Burns' gang members is an Aboriginal man, and when a racist policeman falls into his trap while looking for his Aboriginal tracker (played by David Gulpilil - again!) he is told "You've got the wrong f***in' blackfella!" In a strange way you find yourself wanting to cheer for this guy - even though the life of a bush ranger is hardly admirable, at least it's self-determining! More subtly, but just as powerfully, when Captain Stanley lets his Aboriginal domestic servant go, before walking through the gate, presumably to return to his own country, he removes his shoes (symbol of the white man's repression), places them carefully in the dirt and then walks out barefoot. It's for reasons like these (and many others) that the extreme violence of this film can be forgiven. I would rather not watch graphic violence and am as uncomfortable with it as most people. But if it's a choice between the sanitised history I learned in school and the horror story that was Australia's actual colonial past, bring on the gore. I don't mind being shocked by violence and racism if it leads to outrage over them and concerted action against them. This is the effect the film ought to have on thoughtful viewers. It doesn't glorify bloodshed, but it has the potential to bring something redemptive out of it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A haunting and brilliant Australian Western, saturated with murder and poetry</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Despite my reservations at Nick Cave's ability to write a sustaining screenplay, he has crafted a totally authentic and compelling account of life in Remote Australia some hundred years ago. Hillcoat brings this vision delightfully to the screen ,and all the actors are brilliant, with the possible exception of Wenham, who almost seems one dimensional in his character, and sadly adds some uncertain and certainly unintentional comic relief. Anyone with a queasy stomach may want to skip this, but this has only the briefest moments of actual on screen violence- in fact they are almost subliminal.This is not one that can wait for DVD however. Cave's brilliant soundtrack (certainly a very worthy purchase) and the gorgeous landscape of Winton QLD makes for an unforgettable experience, where the characters battle the crippling harshness and cruel beauty of the land as much as their own tortured souls and each other.Simply the strongest movie I have seen in a very long time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Captain Maurice Stanley (Ray Winstone) has been brought to a village in outback Australia in the 1880's to "civilize" its inhabitants by a prominent citizen (David Wenham). The movie opens with a gunfight between Stanley's police and members of the Burns family, surrounded in their home. The police prevail, and Stanley presents Charlie Burns (Guy Pearce)with a proposition, that he kill his psychotic brother Arthur (John Huston). Arthur's gang had recently murdered a farming family, including the pregnant wife, and burnt down their home, causing outrage in the Banyon community. As a surety, Stanley takes a younger brother Mikey as a hostage, and states that he will be hung for the murders in 9 days on Christmas Day. Stanley enjoins his men not to tell anyone about the proposition, but during a drunken spree his sergeant opens up, and the news spreads to Wenham, who plays his role of supercilious money superbly. Wenham orders that Mikey be given 100 lashes. After 40 his bloodied body is cut from the triangle and he is thrown in his cell to die. Captain Stanley had sought to intervene, but lacked the toughness required to face down a major landowner and the townspeople. Arthur, with Charlie in tow, hears what has happened, and comes to Banyon for revenge. The movie plays out to inevitable tragedy. Stanley loves his new wife and her English ways and sensibilities; this choice signals his weakness in a harsh land. Wenham courts the crowd to feed his arrogance. The sergeant sees any fineness as weakness and despises Stanley. And Arthur requires a spark to unleash a devilish fury. A powerful story of human character and death played out against a forbidding landscape.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just another terrible Aussie movie (that's what they'll say), I mean aren't they all. We have no good writers, average directors and actors who can't wait to get away. Everyone was happy in Australia to put the boot into the local industry time and time again, but where were those people when this masterpiece came out, probably refusing to see this because its too violent, or bagging it because it took English money to make it. This is a sensational western, one of the best ever (Up there with The Wild Bunch, Unforgiven and the Good, the Bad and the Ugly) and if it wasn't Australian it probably would have made a lot more money. But who needs money, I'm sure every person who saw this movie was moved, and I suppose that's what cinema is about. Although if people actually go see good movies, Hollywood will be forced to make good movies, but that's just a thought. I'm too angry at the general population to actually continue writing this.</fullReview>

But knowing how cold and evil this movie is does help you enjoy the more subtle things like character and story. There are some nice performances here (John Hurt was a highlight) and I found myself wishing the story would move away from Guy Pearce and back to Ray Winstone. The story itself is as Western as they come: retribution, justice, misanthropic family. Fairly simplistic. It's not a bad movie, and it does plunge you into the brutal Australian outback where society lives on the raggedy edge.But it is, first and foremost, a nasty affair. The violence runs grisly, and when the blood isn't flying, the sound design picks up the slack and your imagination does the rest.Not my thing.5/10</fullReview>

Instead of hanging them both, Stanley has a proposition for Charlie. If Charlie kills his feared criminal brother Arthur (Danny Huston), Stanley would give both him and Mikey pardons. Martha Stanley (Emily Watson) is lonely without her husband.It is dusty, dirty and brutal. Ostensively, this is Guy Pearce's movie with the two brothers. I find Stanley even more fascinating.

		<shortDescription>Brutal, uncompromising vision</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Few westerns get as bleak, hopeless and depressing as John Hillcoat's achingly beautiful The Proposition. It puts us in colonial Australia, where British immigrants live, restless in their empty, harsh new land, and prone to troublesome, destructive behaviour. Guy Pearce plays Charlie Burns, a ruthless outlaw. When his young brother is captured by menacing lawman Stanley (Ray Winstone), he's given a deal: find their even worse, murdering brother Danny Burns (Danny Huston), or hang with his brother. This sets an ambient chase in motion across the dusty outback. This is no streamlined action opus though. It ambles along like a 3 wheeled cart, taking its time getting where it's going and making uncomfortable pauses to dwell on the brutality that befalls the characters. Where other directors would shy away and show something off screen, Hillcoat refuses to compromise, keeping his camera dead center on the atrocities, which makes for uncomfortable viewing, but always compelling. Huston makes a cunning monster of Danny, a vicious outlaw with neither compassion nor remorse. Winstone finds himself at odds with his wife (Emily Watson) who finds his methods too harsh, but has no notion of the lengths the outlaws go, and how bad it can get, until they're at her door in a nauseating sequence that encapsulates the bitter tone. Pearce makes a silent but deadly gunslinger, saying more in a shift of horse or twitch of his grimy trigger finger than could be written in volumes. John Hurt shows up as a drunken old coot, and David Wenham makes a wormy high ranking official. Hillcoat combs the restless wisps of mist that shroud barren rock faces as well as he navigates the weathered and world weary mugs of his terrific troupe of actors, creating a hard luck, take no prisoners, kick in the nuts of a western that will entrance and exhaust you emotionally. Alternative maestro Nick Cave turns in a spine chilling spoken word original score that coasts on the hoof beats, gunshots, screams, whiplashes and devilish deeds of the lost souls in this uncompromising tale.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It Took Years to Write This Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I did not read any of the other reviews until I finally wrote my own . . . have wanted to do it for years, but am intimidated by the scope of this 2005 movie, from the acting, to the haunting scenes, all the way to minutia that is impossible to get out of your head. There are things in this movie that you cannot un-see or un-hear. Whether you ultimately love this movie or not, you'll never get it out of your brain.Americans make the best movies, right? Well, if that is your belief, this purely Australian/British ensemble will shake you to your core, from Director John Hillcoat all the way to the screenplay and music of Nick Cave, it is an Australian masterpiece.So, what stands out . . . I mean besides everything? The acting, the actors. If you want to see professionals, from famous to unknown, ply their trade, watch and listen, you're about to go on an actors' hayride.Let's pick one, to me previously unknown actor Tom Budge. One of those performances where every time he is on the screen, you want to turn to every other viewer and ask, "Did you see that?!? Were you listening, watching?" As a dirty, vile little scumbag of a character, he left his mark on cinema in this movie.Other fine performances? OMG, all of them, but how could you possibly overlook that Australian of all Australians, David Wenham? A perpetual favorite in so many Aussie settings and by so many other actors from down under, e.g., Nicole Kidman. His dialog is so precise, so contemptuous that just listening to him makes the viewer want to spit, to get the awful taste out of their own mouth.Summary: A movie for movie lovers, a violent and haunting travesty of mankind at its absolute worst . . . and best. Don't miss this one. I'm 70 and I've been watching movies since Scarlett enchanted us all. Let "The Proposition" haunt you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Proposition is brutal, violent, and uncompromising, but also beautiful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Proposition is a Western that takes place in the Australian outback in the 1880s. It is brutal, violent, and uncompromising, but also beautiful and thought provoking. It primarily examines the impulse among imperialists to "civilize" the lands they occupy through violence. The film's narrative flows through a "proposition" made by a local sheriff to a captured criminal. He must track down his outlaw older brother and kill him, or else his younger brother, who was also captured, will be executed. Interestingly, this proposition is essentially a sub-plot in a larger story about one civilization attempting to impose itself upon another, and the brutal oppression required to do that. The film perfectly illustrates this with the image of a perfectly manicured upper-class British home, surrounded by harsh desert populated by an indigenous Aboriginal people. The Proposition is an experience of pure cinema, fully utilizing image, sound, and music to achieve an artistic vision that can only be film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Proposition... a 2005 Australian / U.K. collaboration is a really very good movie . It is unforgiving in its relentless negative assertions of the human being.. It washes away the clean suppositions of the American "wild west", as told by great American movie directors over many decades. This is the real...TRUE GRIT... , a film that dares you to assume this couldn't have happened. O.K....its in the Australian Outback, but men are men...and when they are free to behave like savages...they will.(It is about survival too) It requires more than one viewing (all great movies do),if you can stand to see again--- the horror that lurks in all of the human psyche... its here for all to see. Ray Winstone (Captain Stanley) is brought from England to "clean up" a particularly nasty family of murderous thugs...the Burns Family. He is a tactical policeman who puts a daring operation into motion. He expects Charlie (Guy Pearce) to kill his brother Arthur (Danny Huston). The scheme is put into jeopardy by the poor judgement of the Judiciary. From that point...anything can (and does) happen. There are violent scenes here...But this is a small town in the Australian Outback in 1890. Violence was not.....un-common. This an above average Australian ("Western")..........Watch IT....!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I haven't really been enjoying Australian movies. I find them to be too much of the same old same old (and in some cases not done well). I watched Rabbit Proof Fence some time ago and I enjoyed it. After some digging I found this, based on the premise it was enough for me to take a look.The plot is that Charlie and Mikey Burns are outlaws who are arrested. Captain Stanley offers Charlie a proposition, to kill his older brother Arthur in 10 days, or Mikey gets hanged.Now the acting is actually pretty average. I don't really like Guy Pearce as an actor and that's the same to Danny Huston. I did enjoy Ray Winstone's performance as well as John Hurt. Aside from that not many of the performances were memorable.I also very much enjoyed the visual quality of this movie. The Australian Outback does look wonderful in this movie and it is a visual treat to the eyes.So if you want to watch an Australian movie that is very grim in tone then this one is for you. If you also are a fan of Westerns then this is also for you. It is well directed and well written. It is worth watching but only to those who either want to see an Australian movie in a different tone or fans of Westerns.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Outback, as well as "The Proposition," is just as punishing and unforgiving as the men who roam it -- and it's savagely entertaining. The film takes all the familiar ingredients of the Western with an Aussie spin. Unlike your typical Western movies, it's much darker, downbeat, and brutally violent. Set in rural Australia in the late nineteenth century, Charlie Burns (Guy Pearce) is a criminal living in the outback. He and his two brothers, Arthur (Danny Huston) and Mikey (Richard Wilson), are outlaws wanted for rape and murder. Arthur is a violent and dangerous cold-blooded sociopath, much more so than his siblings, and is wanted by the law. The authorities capture Charlie and Mikey after a bloody shootout, and the brothers are handed over to Captain Stanley (Ray Winstone), a British lawman sent to Australia to help bring order to the colonies. The Captain's proposition to Charlie is to gain a pardon for both of the brothers, by tracking down the elusive Arthur and killing him. Charlie scours the backwaters of Australia, but isn't certain if he can carry out his mission. A movie you cannot turn away from; heartless and uncompromising, filled with disregard to innocence and civility.One of the strengths of "The Proposition" is its relentless moral ambiguity. Characters that would be heroic in more conventional Western movies show their darker sides here. It's a tough and uncompromising story, but it's superbly written, features terrific acting on all fronts, and its beautiful cinematography captures this desolate landscape where only the strongest survive.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think the main downfall of this movie is that the entire plot is revealed in the first five minutes of it (as well as the plot synopsis). John Hillcoat also directed "Lawless" which was a pretty good movie but since it was based on real events it doesn't matter if it was predictable. This wasn't allowed the same graces. Danny Huston's voice was really the only reason I kept watching it. Guy Pierce was decent, Richard Wilson was awful snivelly, and Ray Winstone was not very threatening, though I did appreciate him standing up for Mike. The other main villain (whose character name I don't remember) was too demented and I really felt sorry for him rather than disliking him. This didn't bring anything to the "aus-western" genre except for the whole "which brother is more important" thing.I think the best way for this to be better would be to reveal the proposition at the very end instead of right away. It wouldn't be a twist ending as much as something worth waiting for.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This one was recommended to me after I watched, and very much liked, The Road (2009) by the same director. Although it's set in Australia in the 1800's, it has very much the look and feel of a Spaghetti Western. It's an interesting film with some nice ideas, but I just didn't seem to be able to connect with any of the characters. More of my thoughts later, here's a brief summary first (summary haters and those that don't wish to know anything about the plot please track down that murderer while I write the next paragraph).Charlie Burns and his young brother, Mike are captured by Captain Stanley and his troops. They are wanted in connection with the brutal rape of the pregnant Mrs Hopkins and the murder of her entire family at their homestead. The older brother, Arthur, has escaped into the hills. Stanley propositions Charlie with either tracking down and killing his brother Arthur or seeing his beloved younger brother Mike hang in nine days. He takes off in search of Arthur but events out in the bush and back in town are about to take a turn for the worse for both Charlie and Stanley? I'll leave my summary here so as not to incur the wrath of the spoiler police.It's a pretty well made film, as I said, in the style of a Spaghetti Western. Some stunning scenery on view, credit to the cinematography for that. Decent performances all round, particularly from Guy Pearce as Charlie Burns and Ray Winstone as Captain Stanley. Both stood out in this one. Emily Watson was also good as Martha Stanley, as was John Hurt as the bounty hunter, Jellon Lamb.As I said at the beginning, I found it quite hard to connect with any of the characters, good or bad. I guess they had no redeeming features in my eyes. I like the concept of the film, but the way it was executed, cutting back and forth between Charlie's search for his brother and events back in town with Captain Stanley, didn't work for me. I found it a bit of a mess over all, but not all bad, there are some scenes in there that I really like, but maybe not enough to make me want to watch it again.My score: 6.7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not quite Unforgiven</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Proposition aspires to be an Australian Unforgiven, but hasn't quite figured out what made that film so great.During the frontier era Down Under, Captain Morris Stanley (Ray Winstone) and his men have managed to capture two members of the terrible Burns Gang. The outlaws are responsible for a string of villainy, including the recent massacre of the Hopkins family. Captain Stanley offers Charlie Burns(Guy Pierce) a deal. If he will venture into the wilderness and kill his mythically evil brother Arthur (John Huston), Charlie and his weak, simple baby brother Mikey (Richard Wilson) will receive pardons. But if he doesn't kill Arthur by Christmas, 9 days away, Mikey will be hung by the neck until he is dead.As Charlie journeys deep into the Australian wastes, Captain Stanley returns to town, where he struggles to keep the misery and ugliness of the world from the eyes of his wife Martha (Emily Watson) while contending with the cold and merciless Mr. Fletcher (David Wenham), the local power broker. Stanley also has to deal with degenerate troops and rebellious Aborigines, while Charlie must handle a liquor soaked bounty hunter (John Hurt) and his insane brother, who's retreated into the hills and made himself ruler of a kingdom of two men, a woman and a dog.If there was one word used to describe The Proposition it would be?hard. A second word would be brutal. A third, dirty. It's a story of how nasty this period of Australian history was and how men either wallowed in it, tried to control it, or just fought to survive it. Almost all of the characters except Martha and Mikey are rough, vicious killers. Morality doesn't separate these men. It's not that some are good and some are evil. They're all pretty bad. What separates them is whether or not they believe the world and people can be better than what they are. Stanley is the "hero" of the story, not because he's a good man, but because he acknowledges how horrible the world is and sacrifices so much to protect his wife from it. He even builds an emotional wall between them, afraid of contaminating her with the things he's seen and done. Charlie is the "hero" of the story, even though he's a murderer, because he finally has enough of the awfulness and refuses to go along with it anymore.But while those two men are powerful parts to the story, the film never really has anything that binds them together or places their internal struggles in some greater context. Unforgiven had striking characters wrestling with personal demons, but it used them to tell a bigger story of the Wild West. I t deconstructed the legends better than any other Western ever has. It starts with the exaggerated romance of the West with English Bob and The Scofield Kid. Then it tears down that pretense with Little Bill, who represents the relentless will and merciless drive it took to really tame the frontier. But then it tears down Little Bill and the idea of order and control, all of it ground under the heel of the suicidal, homicidal, chaotic malevolence of William Munny. It dissolves the Western hero down to a mass murderer who triumphs through luck and pure meanness.The Proposition never has a larger point to make about the Australian frontier like that. And without it, the film is a bit of a grueling march from one human atrocity to another.The other star of the movie is the Australian landscape. Like most other Westerns, the land upon which men fight and scheme and die is as much a character as they are. But this land has none of the grandeur or nobility of the American West. It is a desolate, broken, blinding abyss that looks as though it has been struck down by God's right hand.The Proposition is a clear and punishing story but it fails to be profound. Whether attempting that and falling short is worthwhile of itself, is something you'll have to decide.</fullReview>

This was why the Hurt Locker worked, this is why the Proposition works.A simple tale, like a lot of really great stories, of a middle brother in outback Australia who is captured by the police and told to kill his older brother in order that his younger brother may be spared. The story swaps between the journey of Charlie Burns(Guy Pearce) and between the police chief, Captain Stanley (Ray Winstone) and his efforts to stabilise the town and protect his wife.The character journeys, both the predictable one of Charlie Burns from outlaw to vigilante (a subtle distinction perhaps) and the more surprising change of Captain Stanley from being the chief villain, for putting Charlie in the questionable moral position, and by the end becoming perhaps the most morally straightforward of the characters.The performances are solid throughout, the cast of sort of alternative great actors including memorable supporting performances from David Wenham and Emily Watson really strut their stuff. There are a lot of scenes in the film which cater to the actors abilities, a lot of scenes where the emotional barometer is really high.The cinematography is also really accomplished. John Hillcoat has gone on to direct the Road and the setting (filmed on location in Australia) seems to led itself nicely to impressive cinematography. Anyone who can take a lens cap off should be able to direct an incredible piece of cinema, but everything Hillcoat does with the camera feels like (to me at least) early Kubric, characters are put centre stage, there is a lot of symmetry and use of really fantastic imagery, even when there are fairly standard interior interchanges, Hillcoat creates beautiful and striking images.Most importantly is the feel of the film, I felt all the way through like there was a kind of a longbow being drawn. Right at the start the arrow is laid, ready to fire, and all the way through the pressure is building and building, until the point when the arrow is released, and in a flurry of violence and power, finishes the cycle of the film.A wonderfully violent and well acted piece of alternative cinema, powerful and shocking and exhilarating. I urge you to see it. Nine and a half out of ten.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>this is what a modern film should be like....... Good dialogue, good characters, good acting, and good cinematography Danny Huston as Arthur is possibly one of the most hugely underrated bad guys in modern movies. His character makes you want to see more let alone his sinister style is so bold every time he is on screen. Superb just by Danny Huston. Guy Pearce does a pretty damn good job as well by stepping out of his typical acting role. The caring brother who the viewer sees as ambiguously good. And of course Ray Winstone is incredible in any movie he is in. He adds the good side to the story, well alittle, just as Pearce's character does. The cinematography was just absolutely beautiful. The music score and sound editing is acceptional as well. The story was intriguing and interesting and ended on an exciting yet dark note. Great movie but not one of the all time greats WOuld have gave it a 8 or 9 but it deserves a 10 on this site bc of the terrible reviewers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Proposition 9-15-08When I think of The Proposition I think of a film that eschews many cinematic/narrative conventions and is all the more interesting for it. The film seems to use action and not words to develop characters. I was vexed for most of the film not understanding why they weren't giving me more to go on in regards to our protagonist. I honestly didn't feel I understood Guy Pearce's Charlie Burns until the final moments of the film. It occurred to me that this seemed to be the point as this sort of eleventh hour revelation occurred for two of the other main characters. It would be a tremendous oversight to speak of this film and not mention the beautiful cinematography. As silly as it may seem it gives one the feel of acutely being there that adds the overall experience a great deal. The film moves along at a slow but steady pace that feels natural and not in the least dull. The afore mentioned Guy Pearce is subtlety brilliant. Danny Huston is a name I am making a point to remember as he was brilliant in this film. Though it is Mr. Ray Winstone that damn near steals the show in a role that calls for both tenderness and intensity.</fullReview>

A little tightening would do well. Some magnificent photography and spacey mysticism, but it needed a more ruthless hand on the tiller.Nonetheless, touching.There is a coolness and reticence to the film which I approve of.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Aussie take on American western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Italy has the films of Sergio Leone, and now Australia has a competent take on the American Western as well. Guy Pearce continually amazes me with the range of his work. Starting with L.A. Confidential, he's continually seeking out new characterizations. Not satisfied with one type of role, or a specific genre like so many of the Hollywood leading men today, Pearce stretches the boundaries of his immense talents each time he appears on screen. Here he plays the middle child, of a group of three reckless, criminal brothers. When he, and his youngest brother are captured by the local authorities, he's given the arduous task of seeking out, and killing the eldest brother he hasn't seen in many years. An outlaw of ruthless reputation who now resides in the dangerous aboriginal outback of Western Australia. While the middle brother has great affection for his younger brother, he doesn't regret leaving his older brother in his past. What ensues is a reawakening of what it means to be civilized in an uncivil world.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I want to say so much about this movie. But as with every work of art ever have been or will be made, it stimulates a great variety of different feelings and thoughts to every one that experiences it. So here is what "The Proposition" made me think. It made me think that there are very few occasions when judging objectively one could be called a purely evil person. Every individual is able of "evil" or "good" deeds depending on the environmental circumstances. Was captain Stanley who wanted so fiercely to "civilise" that place, evil? Was his wife who wanted to see Mike Burns lashed for the death of her friend, evil? Were the prison wardens evil? Was Arthur Burns evil? Were all the citizens that demanded Mike Burns to be lynched, evil? I do not think so. They were certainly not good, too. Some were stupid, some were corrupted with power to deal death so easily, some were afraid, and some just wanted someone to pay for all the fear that they had dealt with all this time, without caring whether he was innocent or not. Is that evil? I do not think so, it is human weakness. Human selfishness. Human fear. Sometimes, you just go there to where you can never return from unscathed. Going there may have been your decision (as was with Arthur Burns) or may have been not (as with his brother, Charlie Burns), this is not relevant. What is relevant is that at times, hurting yourself or the ones you care about, either physically or psychologically, is inescapable. This, of course, does not make everything all right for you, but unfortunately this is life. I liked this movie because it showed that humans are both able of great evil and great good. I liked it because it has a very catching atmosphere and the music to go with it. I liked this movie because it made me think optimistic. I am disappointed by people, but sometimes I have to remind myself that it is not purely our fault. We are weak and pathetic, and everybody who expects perfection from the human race is delusional. And the fact alone that people can make films (or whatever else) that make you think about these matters, is surely optimistic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Aussi western....and it works!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was a bit scared that an Australian western just wouldn't work, but this movie definitely proved otherwise. Set against the harsh reality of the colonialism in Australia, this movie is telling the story of a man that must make a '' Sophie's choice '' between either his older brother or his younger one. On the other hand we see the storyline of the sheriff that captured the young sibling and is demanding this horrific exchange. His wife lost a dear friend because of the brothers, and she's forcing him to punish them as severely as possible.The strength of this movie is that it doesn't choose any sides. There are villains nor heroes, good people nor bad people; just a bunch of people victimized by the harshness of life during that particular part of history.I liked this movie. It brings back a new élan to the western-genre, stripping it from certain clichés while putting it in a correct historical context. This is what the western needed for quite some time now. And you know, I kinda hope that this title generates more Australian based westerns in the near future.The only thing I have to comment at is that the relationship between the two older brothers felt a bit rushed. They had very little screen time together. A missed chance.</fullReview>

He was on the floor and it looked like he only had one arm left, and the other arm got shot with Author's bullet. If he did have his arm sawed off, shouldn't there have been a lot more blood squirting EVERYWHERE? Next, Did Charlie and Mikey actually participate in the initial rape and murder of the innocent family in the beginning? Were they there for sure? When Charlie is going back through the burned site of the massacre, it looks as if he was visiting it for the first time (so, he and Mikey are innocent, and just being punished for Arthur's crimes ? just 'cause they are brothers?) Also, was Martha actually getting raped, or was the guy just starting to rape her? I cannot tell if the rape actually happened (if contact was made).Lastly - do you think Charles had to be 'on the run' and completely leave that part of the land? I mean, if he stayed wouldn't there by a bounty on his head?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rounding Up The Burns Brothers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For those of you who think the American West was a rough place to be, ought to take a look at The Proposition and what it took to bring in the famous bushrangers of the day. In fact the methods used to kill Jesse James and Billy the Kid are nothing compared to what constabulary captain Ray Winstone tries to do get the infamous Burns brothers.The film opens with Winstone and his men capturing two out of the three, young Richard Wilson just leaving his teens and middle brother Guy Pearce. But the eldest, the leader, Danny Huston is the one they really want. At that point Winstone comes up with a proposition that I'm sure the authorities in the USA would never have put to Frank James in order to get Jesse. He sets Pearce free and says to him, bring Huston in or the younger one hangs in nine days. Let me make it clear here, that the Burns brothers aren't busy robbing banks or trains in some populist war of their own making like the James brothers. All three of the brothers and the rest of their gang were just busy massacring a settler family and raping the pregnant mother. These are not nice people, still this is not something most of us would have had the nerve to propose.A lot goes wrong from both sides and it all ends with a lot of blood spilled. If a semblance of law and order is established by the end of the film, you be the judge.The Australian frontier of the nineteenth century was not a place for the fainthearted. Still The Proposition suffers from a lack of rooting interest for either side, both are so bloody. The most sympathetic character is that of Emily Watson, Winstone's wife. I might have enjoyed The Proposition more if there was a decent rooting interest provided by the story. Still The Proposition is a well crafted picture of life on the Australian frontier, shot on that frontier in Queensland.</fullReview>

Well, we mustn't forget the drunken Jellon Lamb (John Hurt). He did tend to rattle on a bit. I really can't square Captain Stanley with Beowulf, even though Winstone played both characters.Guy Pearce (Momento, L.A. Confidential) was very good as the brother who had to do the dirty deed to save his younger brother.It was the Queensland scenery that made this film worth watching, but when you are looking at characters that are presented in varying shades of gray and have to choose who may be good or bad, then that challenge is what makes good film.</fullReview>

It is incomparable to Leone's works and Unforgiven, plain and simple. To cut it short:Likes: the originality. I love the idea of a western set in late nineteenth century Austrailia. The inclusion of native aborigines and English/Irish settlers in a western setting was neat to witness.the cinematography. The director has done a great job and I believe the filmwork, shots and scenery really made this movie. The colors and gritty feel to it I thought were great and it is good to see some creativity in recent films. Reminded me of "Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada.", another recent film I enjoyed more. the acting, (to some extent). I thought Ray Winstone and Emily Watson did a great job. John Hurt was the greatest performance and I wished he had played a larger role (I felt the movie needed more characters like him). the others were "decent enough".a different western that is refreshing to see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There is little not to like about John Hillcoat's "The Proposition". The story is genuine and emotional, but also savage and brutal. When it comes to violence, the movie does not hold back like many films of its kind. This will turn away some viewers and attract others. The movie is also well-shot and acted. One of the best things about it is that it always keeps your attention. You become wrapped up in the characters' struggles and it's a very intriguing watch.The film has been labeled an Australian western, and while there are some certain elements of western, I would say it's a breed all it's own. It doesn't come close to films like "Unforgiven" and "The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly", but it does stand it's own ground. In fact, if it is a western, it is the best one in several years. This movie is an emotional roller coaster ride, and it is just short of brilliant. I was glad I watched this gem.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>tense, violent folk narrative</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Since the appearance of the Mick Jagger "Ned Kelly", I have seen a number of attempts to transfer the "Cowboy" genre, or "Western" to Australia. Should be easy - hot dry desert landscapes, an oppressed native population, man on horseback carrying guns - yep, John Wayne or Clint Eastwood ride into focus - "g'day!" Well, not quite. This is a very beautifully made film, and some of the other "Aussie Westerns" aren't half bad. But this film reveals, like none of the rest ever did, why it is Westerns can not be made in Ausdtralia.At the time in which this film is set, Australia had three distinct ethnic groups - English, Celtic (Irish and Scottish), and native - that effectively defined three economic classes as well: rich, poor, and poorer, respectively.Despite the wretched bias against natives in the American West, the fact remains that - at least in comparison to 19th century Australia - 19th century America was truly a land of opportunity - it was easy to lose one's past and show up as a cowboy with an assumed name. It wasn't so easy, but it was possible, to begin a cowboy's life and eventually work to become a wealthy rancher. The reverse, by the way, was equally true.Most of the outlaws in this film are Irish; so we know - and they know, which is more important - that they are doomed - they will die as outlaws, or suffer short lives as indentured servants, or die of exposure in a wilderness far harsher than America's.This fatalism makes them desperate men with little opportunity - becoming criminals is as close to freedom as they can get. The important moment in a man's life in the American West is his act of self-definition - he chooses his name, he chooses what he does - he even chooses his personality, as director John Ford demonstrated in films as early as "Stage Coach" and as late as "The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance".The characters in "The Proposition" aren't so lucky. Eventually, none of them can stop being who they are - this leads to the final sequence of scenes in which all efforts at self-definition transgress to the point of extreme violence, until the predefined self is accepted; which certainly brings a kind of peace, but at a terrible price.As for the rest of the film - gorgeous photography, a strong script, solid direction, excellent acting - the film could have been trimmed in the editing room, but the over-all effect still carries quite a punch.So I do recommend this film as a tense, violent folk narrative about life in Australia when living there was almost unbearably hard (for the Europeans, that is).But there are no cowboys here, this is not a "Western".Hopefully, Australian film-makers will realize that they need not borrow from or compete with Western movies from the West - they have their own stories to tell, and can certainly find their own means for telling them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What can only be described as a work of savage beauty</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One thing must be pointed out from the start - any with a weak stomach need not apply. Whilst each frame is a work of almost picture postcard perfection, the atmosphere and ambiance a work of art first and cinematography second, there are moments of barbarism and brutality which some may find rather unsettling. But this is no piece of self-indulgent ultra-violence; what this film portrays is the nature of man to meld with his environment, that a savage place may make savagery necessary. Aside from the obvious attention to detail in making this as authentic a period drama as is possible, the soundtrack is a hundred per cent spot on, the individual performances, especially from John Hurt and Guy Pearce, are fantastic, and the script contains some truly memorable lines. From a personal standpoint, I'm not a big fan of either the western or period drama genres (depending on which you think this falls into, maybe both), and if it wasn't for the Nick Cave written screenplay, I may not have bothered watching (I'm a bit of a fan, shall we say). However, it has to be said that this is as good an example of a hard hitting period drama/western as you're likely to find, especially from a relatively unknown director on a less than excessive budget. Definitely worth a look, if you're not bothered by a bit of blood and guts action, and as enjoyable a film as I've watched in a long time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Australia One: Homo Sapiens Nil</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Two Australian movies have made it to Santa Cruz in the last month. But whilst the first, Look Both Ways, left me feeling better when I came out of the theatre than when I went in ? despite the subject matter of testicular cancer ? The Proposition has me much more unsettled. This is an unremittingly gloomy movie, and one in which no one is having any fun at all. Certainly not the Aborigines whose land has been stolen, the settlers who are trying to make a living there, the police tasked with keeping order in this violent frontier land or even the maniacal outlaws for whom rape and murder are everyday events. This is, of course, all the fault of the British, who settled Australia by force, so I came out of the theatre with a large excess of post-colonial angst, even by my high, angst-ridden, guilty, British ex-pat standards. We Brits are the spawn of the devil, and I don't need drunken, racist 19th century troopers singing Rule Britannia to remind me of my place in the order of things.But the movie. The Proposition of the title is that Charlie Burns, Irish homicidal outlaw in tough colonial Australia (excellently played by incredibly thin Guy Pearce), kill his psychotic elder brother Arthur (Danny Huston ? picturesquely disheveled ring leader of the Burns family gang who raped and murdered a settler family), in order to save his younger, slightly dim-witted brother Mikey (Richard Wilson) from the gallows. Mikey and Charlie have been caught by Captain Stanley (Ray Winstone ? perfect in the role) of the local troopers, and it is Stanley who makes the proposition to Charlie, so while Mikey is thrown in jail to await his hanging and provide sport for the uncouth guards, Charlie goes off into the desert to catch up with Arthur and destiny. A loquacious and philosophical bounty hunter (John Hurt) is also after Arthur, and meanwhile back at the ranch, Captain Stanley tries to hide the true nature of the violent and unpleasant place they have come to inhabit, from his innocent English wife Martha, (lovely Emily Watson), who serves tea in delicate bone china cups, and dresses for dinner while the neighbors are being butchered. Add to the mix a sadistic English landowner Eden Fletcher (David Wenham, whose buttoned up portrayal of Fletcher suggests the guy had an unpleasant experience at an all-boys British public school), who wants a Burns, any Burns, flogged and dead, and who leads a towns-folks' mutiny against Stanley's more measured approach to law enforcement, and the scene is set for some extreme violence. And that is what we get with The Proposition. I'm not saying that's a good thing or a bad thing ? it's just a warning. (My husband actually refused to go with me.) I can't remember ever before being warned about a movie by the staff at the box office when I bought the ticket, but that's what happened this time. But then this is America; they were probably concerned I'd sue if I was upset by the gore.The film is beautifully photographed. We see sun bleached, stark rock and desert. Barely a blade of grass or a tree survives in this primeval landscape, there are vast, magnificent blood red sunsets, dust, grime and flies. The local Aborigines are being systematically rounded up and exterminated, except for a few who work as the white man's servants and are portrayed as traitors. The location filming is excellent, and I loved the soundtrack, written I assume by musician Nick Cave who wrote the script.The main problem I have when I watch movies like this is that I'm far too practical. I look at Arthur, camping out for months in the rocky, barren, drought ridden hills, and I wonder where he got all the fodder to keep his horses in such good shape. I watch Arthur staring meaningfully into the sunset and spouting poetry, and I wonder why he bothers with all the murder and mayhem as he's apparently not even making any money from it? We are given no insight into what made him the way he is. This is a man who enjoys stamping people to death, and I want to know why. The movie is very stylized, doesn't really have a satisfactory conclusion and is perhaps trying too hard to be meaningful, but that isn't necessarily a bad thing. It's certainly a little ponderous in places but at least it is trying to say something, and to engage our brains. Not a "Friday Night" movie by any means. I'm just not certain quite what it IS saying, nor am I certain how meaningful it really is, but I actually enjoyed it more than I thought I would, given that our local movie critic excoriated it.And looking at that geologically ancient landscape, I came away with the feeling that when all the people are long gone from Australia, the landscape will still be there, essentially untouched and as utterly remote and alien as it was long before even the Aborigines found it. Perhaps it's the one place which never should have been settled, and the people - black, white and everything in between - are just a temporary blip on Australia's vast history, and for all the tragedy and violence, their passing will be barely noticed by the land.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the greatest Westerns of all time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My first thought when this film ended was "WOW". And it's not easy to elicit a reaction like that, especially nowadays. But this stunning piece of Australian cinema left me awed and breathless from the opening credits to the harrowing ending. It begins with a montage of snapshots depicting the era- 1880's Australian Outback- including photos of a murdered family, all set to a hypnotic lullaby. What follows is a gunfight reminiscent of a video game in its intensity and ferocity. When the smoke clears Captain Stanley (Ray Winstone, in his best performance since "Sexy Beast") offers a deal, or proposition, to Charlie Burns (Guy Pearce, channeling the Spaghetti Western-era Clint). We learn that the Burns Brothers have been inflicting terror on the region for some time, and that includes the rape and murder of the woman, along with her unborn child, husband and young son, seen in the opening. Captain Stanley, the proverbial "new sheriff in town", has been brought in to tame the wild frontier. But upon capturing Charlie and the younger Mike, instead of killing them, he makes them an offer: Charlie must go track down &amp; kill the eldest Burns brother, the vile Arthur (a brilliant Danny Huston) within nine days, or Mike will be hanged.Charlie reluctantly agrees and gallops into the barren wilderness to track down Arthur, who has been hiding in a remote cave. Along the way he crosses paths with sly bounty hunter Jellon Lamb, wonderfully played by John Hurt, and is nearly killed by a spear from an aborigine. When Charlie wakes from his coma he finds that he has been saved by Arthur and his small band of cohorts, and unaware of Charlie's intentions, they welcome him back to the fold. Meanwhile, Stanley is facing opposition in town from all sides for letting Charlie go, including from his loving, loyal wife Martha (the always-excellent Emily Watson). She wants justice for her murdered friend in the form of 100 lashes for the one brother in jail, the feeble Mike. The scenes of Martha questioning her husband about the case, and his refusal to answer her despite, or because of, his obvious love for her add a deep emotional sideline to the main story. ***SPOILERS**** By now Charlie is healthy enough to kill his brother, yet seemingly reluctant to do so- he has numerous opportunities but lets them all slip by. The answer to the age old question "is there loyalty among thieves" appears to be "yes", especially when the thieves are brothers. Ultimately Charlie decides to stay true to his blood and the group rides back to town to exact revenge on those responsible for Mike's imprisonment, starting with Captain Stanley. This leads to the film's mind-blowing climax: when they arrive in town they immediately head to the jail to rescue Mike; this is accomplished by lopping the guards' heads off. Charlie takes the wounded Mike to safety, where he dies in his arms. At the same time Arthur and Sammy head to the Stanley home to finish their plan. The brutal beating of the Captain and subsequent rape of Martha is absolutely agonizing to witness. But just when I thought I couldn't take any more, Charlie arrives, and after having another apparent change of heart, puts an end to the insane cycle of violence once and for all. ***END SPOILERS*** Much has been said about both the cinematography and violence in this film; let me confirm that BOTH are spectacular. The scenic vistas drenched in sun-baked light, burning sunsets over the stark plains, twisted trees that resemble sculptures and luminous star-studded night skies never ceased to awe. And the amount of flies, dirt, and blood in the film had me swatting the air and trying to spit dust from my dry mouth; if the cinematographer isn't nominated for an Oscar there needs to be an investigation! As for the violence, yes it is unflinching &amp; raw, but completely appropriate for the time. It's true that scenes like Mike's flogging, the Stanleys' torture and heads being cut off, beaten to a pulp and shot in half are graphic &amp; disturbing, but it's not gratuitous like in movies such as "Hostel", rather necessary to portray the harsh realities of life during that period. In fact there are probably fewer actual SCENES of violence than in your average slasher flick, it's just that in contrast to the slow pace and soothing backdrop of the rest of the film these moments hit you like a sucker punch to the gut, further driving home their effect. But the real beauty of the film is that the story, adapted by Aussie icon Nick Cave, is multi-layered and complex while appearing very simple and minimalistic. The characters are all conflicted, like many of us today,and make decisions both right and wrong; even Arthur's twisted logic that everything they do is okay because they are family has a sick nobility to it. The class-dictated racial hatred is another (unfortunate) parallel to modern life. So you can look at this film in two ways: an unrelenting tale of violence and vengeance, and an allegory for the problems that have been plaguing mankind for thousands of years.When all is said and done this film will go down as one of the greatest Westerns of all time. With its beautiful scenery, gut-wrenching violence, fantastic acting and haunting score, THE PROPOSITION is a film that will be watched over and over again for many years to come, yet another quality absent from most movies today .</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pleasantly surprised by this movie. Very grim but I loved Guy Pearce's character, and the tight loyal sense of brotherhood that pervaded the film. At times the dialog between the captain and his wife got tiresome (like the bathtub conversation about her dream with the baby holding on to her finger-what was that all about?), but the cinematography was beautiful. I loved the flick because it kept my attention and had some brutal violence. I am not familiar with the director's other work, but I enjoyed the fact that this movie was set in 1880's Australia and had some current trendy music as a soundtrack. The movie also portrayed the horrible treatment of aboriginal people as what it was, horrible.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Australia's answer to Sergio Leone and Pale Rider</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If there is any justice in this world, Nick Cave and John Hillcoat would be up for Academy Awards. Cave's screenplay betrays his classic education and is tight and, in parts, very raw. The performances in this remarkable film are brilliant and often haunting. There is Guy Pearce doing his level best to add a new dimension to his western as one of the Burns' gang who murder, rape and generally make a nuisance for themselves in the Outback. Pearce's performance invokes memories of Pale Rider/Clint Eastwood or any cowboy that Clint has played. His is the hostile lawbreaker, the outsider who is tormented by the Proposition of the title which means he has to kill his elder brother, played superbly by Danny Huston or have his younger brother face the noose.And then there is Ray Winstone and Emily Watson, both acting a little against type. Watson plays Winstone's wife, a woman who passionately loves her husband but finds his employment frustrating and finds out with horror how her best friend was killed. Winstone is the law man desperately trying to find a way to tame the savage nature of both prisoner and, in metaphor, the land. Even his wife is trying to grow roses in the harsh landscape.The only jarring aspect in all of this, is David Wenham. From his performance in Lord of the Rings as Faramir, he is a capable and precise actor but doesn't seem to quite convince as an Englishman in this film. Perhaps it was the accent he finds difficulty with and that's odd because both Winstone and other actors find their accents rather more convincing.But hats off to Cave, above all, and also his haunting and uneasy music to accompany this film. I sincerely hope he makes more films because they will be worth watching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Proposition" was a beautifully photographed film. I've read that the wardrobe tried to be authentic down to the buttons and it was very impressive. I thought the acting was good and Guy Pearce, Ray Winstone, Emily Watson and John Hurt were all very effective. Unfortunately I thought the movie to be just another violent cowboy movie, albeit Australian cowboys, with outback aborigines instead of Indians providing the focus for hatred. We do seem to need someone to hate. For all of the heavy scenes pondering the sunset and significant stares between the characters the story was about killing and violence. Ray Winstone's and Emily Watson's relationship had some distracting interest but not enough to move the movie away from the gore. Parts of the movie were very slow with all the pondering and heaviness. I thought the movie portrayed the life and times authentically, like the flies and the dirt and the stench, and as I said it was beautifully photographed. It was just too gory for me, and it didn't need to be.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very violent Christmas</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Proposition tells us with its opening credits of late nineteenth century photographs what it's about: a family's been massacred by outlaws in the Australian outback. Later we learn the raped mother was pregnant. The opening scene is a violent shootout like L.A. Confidential's finale: the interior of a cabin lit only by bullet holes in the walls where defenders shoot and scramble and die resisting police attackers. This was the Burns gang, and it was they who perpetrated the "Hopkins Outrage" shown in the opening stills. Mikey Burns (Richard Wilson) and Charlie Burns (Guy Pearce) wind up in a jail presided over by Captain Morris Stanley (Ray Winstone). But these are the good guys. The really evil brother Arthur Burns (Danny Huston), mastermind and chief perpetrator of the violence, is still at large, and Stanley makes Charlie a proposition: he will keep the weak, whimpering young Mikey as hostage and let Charlie out and grant him and Mikey both full amnesty if Charlie will find and kill his brother Arthur by Christmas.This is a movie that plays with ambiguities: who is honest and good, the Law, or the lawless? In the midst of it is the weak, well-meaning man played by Winstone (who looks slimmer and healthier than usual, but still carries with him an acting legacy of slime-bags and gleeful cockney villains). Arthur spouts poetry and admires sunsets and murmurs constantly of love and family, but he's unquestionably a sadistic killer who goes wild when he sees blood. He himself wonders why Charlie has never stopped him. Why hasn't he? And what should Charlie do? Is fratricide an appropriate gesture to usher in the Christmas season? Pearce's steely leanness serves to give him a certain aura of knighthood beneath the outlaw grime and he recovers from a spear wound, like Tristan. The most obvious bad man is a local English territorial governor, a nasty racist type, set off as impossible to like by a bad complexion and an upper-class accent, who wants aborigines killed in bunches to frighten them off reprisals and orders that Mikey be given a flogging that is very likely to kill him. An unnecessary wild card, a bit of color who's a bit too colorful, is Jellon Lamb (John Hurt), whose florid opening drunk scene shows too little directorial control. In uneasy relationship with the morally murky, racist-minded whites are the hapless indigenous locals.Where The Proposition excels is in the way it infuses interiors, street scenes, and the weathered faces and clothing of its actors with period authenticity. Emily Watson, pale skinned and perfectly groomed as Morris Stanley's wife Martha, presides with some dignity over a microcosm of the colonial world, magically producing a turkey, even a Christmas tree with decorations and fake snow in time for Jesus' birthday, when the events come to a close. Watson is beautiful and noble and real in a thankless role: the writing isn't quite good enough to develop her character well. "I'm a resourceful woman," she says, and we believe her, but she remains too static.The Proposition is disturbing, yet shallow. The cast is good, the filmmakers are able in the look they achieve, and Cave's music is powerful if you accept rock as a background to nineteenth-century scenes, but the screenplay is scrappy and not entirely coherent. An opening warning says indigenous peoples may be offended by some of the treatment shown in the film. I should have said human beings might be offended. You see an aborigine's head blown apart (a remarkable shot), and you hear blacks spoken of with condescension, but you also see white men humiliated, shot, beaten, stabbed with spears, and torn to pieces. Hillcrest and Cave's creation may evoke the westerns of Pekinpah or Eastwood but also films of Australian massacres. Its period look resonates with that of Jarmusch's Dead Man. Yet it has its own distinctive desolation, one which will alienate many while making some ardent converts.(Released in Australia in 2005 and much celebrated there; limited US release May 2006.)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Burns brothers are convicted murderers and are on the run. When two of the three brothers are caught; Charlie and Mike, Charlie is brought forward with a proposition from Captain Stanely. In nine days it will be Christmas day; Charlie has till then to capture and kill his older brother Arthur, or his younger brother Mike will hang. Charlie sets out to track Arthur to save Mike, but has a moral conflict on which brother should die. Martha, Captain Stanely's wife has been feeling ignored, that her husband cares more about his job than her. She starts to question Stanely when she discovers that he is protecting Mike from harm when Mike has killed Martha's close friend.With the recent influx of great Australian films lately, The Proposition is another great film; but it doesn't reach the same caliber of Little Fish and Look Both Ways. The problem i found was within Nick Cave script. It doesn't keep a consistent flow; jumping from one place to another. You feel like your not getting enough information as it doesn't give you time to gather enough, as you are moving back and forth between the two stories so fast. Though Nick Cave has captured the period of early colonial Australia in great fashion. The rascal intolerance, the brutal of the dry landscape and the harsh violence this country was forged on. This country was made on the blood of many indigenous people and it is reflected very harshly and very confronting manner. What was very unnerving about The Proposition wasn't really the violence, though it is very violent, is the underlying brutality that runs under the surface. This is evoke so well through the people and more through the landscape. Its so disturbing the readiness of how the people will freely bash and torture people. There is a whipping seen that rivals the one from The Passion of the Christ. Not for the violence but for the sheer emotions that come from it. The screams just pierce your mind and resonate.Guy Pearce is at his best here. At times he did seem abit rigid, but thats a minor flaw in a very good performance. Emilt Watson is also great as Martha, adding that touch of realism to the British settlement, also with John Hurt as the bounty hunter Jellon Lamb. His brief two scenes are two high points of the film. Ray Winstone is the stand out as Captain Stanely, his performance was just flawless.John Hillcoat's direction is great and the cinematography really made the film. The landscape is really captured perfectly, though it feels somewhat surrealistic at times, making it feel very foreboding. Rising this is Nick Caves and Warren Ellis's music score, its very haunting.It may not be the best Australian film this year, but its still a great film of our harsh violent history.</fullReview>

It is set in Australia in the late 1800's.Charlie (Guy Pearce, in his finest work since "Neighbours) and his younger brother Mikey (Richard Wilson, formerly from "McLeod's Daughters) are caught during a siege. Mikey is thrown into prison and Charlie is given an ultimatum- find and deliver his older and much more sought after brother Arthur (Danny Huston, in his finest work since he played Bartender 2 in "Leaving Las Vegas") or Mikey will be hung.Charlie sets off to find his older brother but unbeknown to him some people in the police force think the offer made to Charlie is foolish and set out to make changes. Eventually Charlie tracks down his brother and lets him know why he's there. The brothers must decide what to do with their brother's life hanging in the balance.A little slow for me and the story wasn't gripping or anything new. A different setting I guess but just way too boring for me. Give it a miss.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wouldn't watch "The Proposition" again, for much the same reasons that I don't have any Nick Cave CDs in my collection. Screenwriter Nick Cave is an intelligent and insightful man and there are scenes of great intensity in this movie. However, there is little here that doesn't feel borrowed from other movies or classic tales. Philosophical and grisly in turns, "The Proposition" is an art house revenge tale. It's well acted, well shot and well written but still somehow manages to be less than the sum of its excellent parts. Let down by a predictable final act, Mr Cave's opus left me ambivalent. I sort of understand why he's as well respected as he is, but his movie has no place in my DVD collection.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Grim Western Dripping in Blood</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Proposition" tells a grimy, ugly story about a sheriff (Ray Winstone) of an Australian settlement in the late 19th century tasked with bringing to justice a brutal murderer and rapist (Danny Huston), who has fled to the hills with his band of criminals. Winstone's men are able to capture the murderer's two younger brothers, and Winstone makes a deal with one of them (Guy Pearce): if he finds and kills his older brother, Winstone will let him and his younger brother go. Pearce heads off to find his brother, not sure if he'll actually be able to go through with killing him; meanwhile, Winstone and his sad, lonely wife (Emily Watson) try to eek out some sort of stable, domestic happiness despite their not being able to have a child, while Winstone, waiting for Pearce to carry out his grisly duty, tries to keep the local townspeople from taking justice into their own hands and lynching the youngest brother, who is left wasting away in the town jail.If you think all of this sounds like the makings of an unpleasant movie, you would not be mistaken. "The Proposition" is heavy going. Director John Hillcoat makes every effort to show late-19th century rural Australia the way it actually was. Virtually every face we see is creased with grease and dirt; nearly every set of teeth we see are in danger of rotting out of the mouths that contain them. The heat of a harsh Australian sun practically comes baking off of the screen and the sound of buzzing flies pervades every scene. Worse, Hillcoat presents the violence in the film candidly and graphically. We see a man's head get blown in half; we see the remains of another man's crushed head after Huston's character stomps it to a pulp; we see all manner of shootings, knifings and spearings; we see a flogging and a near rape. The movie indeed is so doggedly grim, so violent, and so lacking in any sort of humour, that its unpleasantness may outweigh any benefits you get from watching it. This may have been the way it really was, but that doesn't mean it makes for a great night's entertainment.The story is well told and the acting is mostly fine. Winstone and Watson's storyline is especially interesting, and I wish it had been taken further. These two struggle desperately to create a civilized life in a world that stubbornly fights to remain uncivilized. Winstone, who the film establishes as a villain in the first scene, emerges as a much more complex character, and he and Pearce, positioned by the story as enemies, actually share much in common, as each sees the need to bring an end to the savagery around him -- Pearce in his brother and band of criminals, Winstone in the townspeople -- and makes attempts to do so in his own way. Pearce and Winstone do fine by their characters, though Pearce's is obtuse and his internal struggles are told to us more than they are shown. Other actors, like Danny Huston, terribly miscast, and John Hurt, who makes a completely pointless and hammy appearance which seems designed to do nothing but add another pool of blood to the proceedings, strike sour notes. "The Proposition" is not a long movie, but it's so grueling that I'm glad it wasn't any longer. I'm not sorry I watched it, but it's not a film I have the faintest desire to revisit. It reminded me of other films released this year, like "Babel" and "Pan's Labyrinth," in which the director and screenwriter seem to be testing me by heaping calamity upon calamity for no discernible purpose other than to see how much I can take. I feel more brutalized by these films than invigorated by their artistry. I have a feeling this trend of storytelling is a reaction to our current troubled and extremely violent times, but I hope a more productive trend emerges soon.Grade: B</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ned Kelly meets the raw, gritty and barren side of Australia</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When the committed sheriff Stanley (Ray Winstone) finally captures two of the infamous desperados the Burns brothers, he offers Charlie (Guy Pearce) a proposition: kill and capture your older brother, or your little brother hangs on Christmas Day. On this Ned Kelly like premise opens a gruelling, grisly 'Western' tale courtesy of Nick Cave, who penned the story in less than three weeks. Yet you could never guess the latter, for it is both well-sketched and layered when it comes to the treatment its characters.Although Guy Pearce is largely at the centre to sew things together, director John Hillcoat deftly wields a parallel storyline in 'The Proposition' ? that of Captain Stanley's private life, exploring the moral qualms he has with his job and how his marriage to Emily Watson's character suffers accordingly. Both actors exude troubles, but rather than wearing it out on their sleeves like Pearce and the outlaws, their qualms are bottled up underneath a lid but bubbling to come up. To the outside world, they are affluent; from the neat rose garden with the white picket fence, the fancy tea-times to the turkey dinners, they possess a typically English culture in their identities. Watson is strong but vulnerable here, grave but sweet as the pretty little housewife.Cut to considerable contrast in the Australian outback ? a "godforsaken hole" as John Hurt's bountyhunter character spitefully remarks. As Charlie travels across the endless desert plains in search for his older brother, 'The Proposition' patiently lets us absorb every acre of sand, glazed in a pure raw atmosphere. Charlie is a man of few words and, like his brother, he typically resorts to violence to get the message across. The aforementioned can be applied to the whole film. It is gruesomely violent, be warned. The torture scene of Charlie's younger brother is unbearable, with a whip thrashing vehemently on his back until the sound is mellowed by the bloody pulp-like matter that is left on his body. The violence has been condemned and labelled 'gratutitous' in the film, and perhaps this is rightly applied because I seem to recall one scene from the beginning outside the prison when the warden mistakenly shoots off his toes and the bloody stump leaks on the sand. This scene serves absolutely no purpose in the film other than perhaps establishing a raw atmosphere or to instill the clumsy image in the character. Other than this, nada. Yet it needs to be said that 'the Proposition' portrays violence in more deft strokes than your average action film, simply because there is NEVER enough to desensitize you ? it still shocks you every time.I believe that aside from the beautiful visuals, the grisly violence and the filthy mood, Nick Cave had a lot to say in his story. The juxtaposition of the honest and straight native Aboriginies (who are killed for sport in the film) with the corrupt and seedy "white folks" says something. It's criticism. 'The Proposition' is certainly one of the most interesting films of 2005 and is well worth checking out if you do not mind a bit of flies, spit, stink, sweat, bruises and blood. One thing is for certain; it makes you feel the dirt and sweat on your clothes as if you were right there in the Australian wilderness.8 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>cinematographically brilliant, but inconsistent story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILERS It's strange, but for a country so steeped in violent and brutal history, Australia's history never seems to get a foot in the door in the British education system. Whilst children learn all about the American West, the Australian equivalent is often ignored and brushed under a carpet. This in itself is a shame because whether recounting the story of Ned Kelly, or simply painting a portrait of the racial abuse shown to aborigines, the Australian Outback is littered with history.Written by musician Nick Cave, 2005's "The Proposition" tells just one side of this hellish place. Led by an emotionless performance by Guy Pierce and a magnificent Ray Winstone, the film is a visually beautiful piece which is unfortunately inconsistent in story.Captured by the violent Captain Stanley (Winstone), middle brother of the infamous Burns gang Charlie (Pierce) is released on the condition that in exchange for his younger brothers life he will kill his vicious elder brother Arthur (Danny Huston). Now, as brother Mike (Richard Wilson) rots in prison, Charlie must set out across the dangerous outback to track down Arthur and fulfil his mission.Violent from the offset, "The Proposition" is not for the faint hearted. From members of the gang being shot in the opening gun battle through to the vicious beating Stanley gives the youngest Burns brother, the story gets going with a powerful opening and is better for it. Unfortunately though, when the story really gets going, it's difficult to keep up this violence progressing and you are forced to fall back on an emotionless, weak performance by Guy Pierce.Pierce is a disappointment, and there's little other way of putting it. Outstanding in so many different roles, it is remarkable that in such a crucial Australian film, Pierce can be so emotionless and wooden.Whilst the story is weak when Pierce is on screen, whenever we feature on the marriage of Ray Winstone and Emily Watson, it is absolutely fascinating. Winstone's character might seem like a violent monster, but as the story progresses, we fast discover that his method is there to protect his wife and that he is actually a million times softer than you could ever imagine. Working beautifully with the enigmatic Watson, the entire partnership is poetry.Aside from the acting, the most important thing about "The Proposition" is the absolutely stunning cinematography. With beautiful sunsets and some amazing shots, the film is permanently bright and stunning. Most noticeable though is the permanent presence of flies. Shot entirely in a small outback town, flies are constantly flying around individuals. In the most violent and powerful scene of the whole film, the most amazing shot involves nothing to do with the violent whipping of Mike Burns, but instead director John Hillcoat's view of the watching crowd's backs all covered from head to foot in flies. It's a poignant, gut retching shot, and a powerful display of what life is like in the Outback.A key question is how well the film deals with history. Designed to reflect the brutality of the American West, it works absolutely wonderfully. At the same time, it also depicts the cruelty shown upon the aborigine population. In one crucial scene, an entire gathering are butchered for little reason other than refusing to accept white lifestyle. Also, for the first time on television, we are presented with an aborigine actually killing another aborigine. It's a unique feat, and just like many aspects of the film, it is a powerful moment.As a historical piece, this film is crucial. Telling the truth about the Australian Outback, it is a magnificent attempt to tell the truth. It is also beautifully shot, with Hillcoat's trademark back shot used to great effect at key moments. Still, the film has it's flaws. Weak when focusing on Guy Pierce's character, and not helped by an emotionless, lame performance by Pierce himself, the story really doesn't click at times. This is a film which should be watched for multiple reasons, but sadly it's not quite as perfect as it could have been.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a truly remarkable landscape</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is a remarkable scene in "The Proposition". The English law man Captain Stanley and his good wife are dining on a plate of eggs and bacon. The breakfast is served in the garden on elegant china. A fly crawls over the plate. This simple image is one of many that a fine director uses to create an atmosphere of incongruity. The English captain is determined to civilize this God forsaken place and tries as hard as he can to create in this barren land scape a little piece of England. The garden roses look obscure and out of place, as out of place as the captain and his wife. Ray Winstone as the captain and Emma Watson as his wife turn in the best performances of their careers. The basic premise has already been described by other contributers but it is not the plot that is the real achievement, its the photography and a remarkably atmospheric sound track. Australia has never looked so eerie. The movie is never preachy, indeed never loses itself in self pity. The brother being tortured by the police and the society is a victim and our hearts go out to him. The images are breath taking. Guy Pearce is brilliant as is the rest of the cast. David Wedham is the only jarring note because his character is almost a caricature. This might have been intended but the normally impressive Wedham grates a little in an other wise brilliant movie. I score it an eight.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Proposition" is to trade a naive younger brother's life for an older diabolical brother. Faced with this choice, Guy Pearce sets out to kill or trap his older brother whilst his younger brother is held captive in a small town prison. Whilst the police captain seems an honourable man, with uncommon strategic intelligence, the rest of the townsfolk are possessed with a small town, right wing mentality.Set in 19th Century pioneer outback Australia, there is a quirky richness that draws the viewer in. The landscape's sunset coloured backdrop visually dazzles and elicits a sensory surge. You can feel the heat, you can smell the sweat, you can taste the dust. Nick Cave's sound track complements the uneasy feeling you experience throughout this movie.The film seems slow to start, but the pace builds not unlike a horse going through its paces. The last few minutes are an exhausting flat out gallop. Looking at the film as a whole, I appreciated the slow context setting and the gradual build up. The acting is first class: I particularly liked the captain. It was enjoyable to see David Wenham play such an unpleasant little man for a change, as his characters are usually so lovable. The violence is rather brutal at times: gasps of shock were elicited at several points in the film.Not for the sensitive or the typical Hollywood cinema going types.8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I remember several years ago seeing '3000 miles to Graceland', and thinking that nothing could get uglier, but compared to the Proposition, that movie feels like 'Barney and Friends'.This has got to be the nastiest, most bloody and mean-spirited film of the year. It is disgraceful. There is no relate able story, no developed characters or character interaction, no heart, and no ending. The plot is lame from the beginning. Guy Pearce plays an Irishman in Australia who is forced to hunt down and kill one of his brothers in order to save the other. Aside from his family, we know virtually nothing about him, which makes him a comatose protagonist. None of the other characters with the possible exception of Ray Winstone are remotely intelligent or respectable. They are so badly constructed that to say they are cardboard would hardly do them justice. They are the most lifeless hand full of people that I've ever seen on celluloid. Ray Winstone should have been the protagonist, him and his wife are the only characters with even a molecule's worth of heart. The Proposition tries to deliver a message which has to do with how ugly justice can be, but the only thing that I learned is what a movie looks like when it is constructed with no taste or respect for humanity.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Very pretty to look at, but the story is a little lacking and the film is altogether too short and shallow. The performances are very strong, with Winstone surprisingly standing out in what turns out to be the film's lead role, and the technical aspects are exceptional, but the story could have used a bit more work. It feels a little light, and, as such, the climax isn't as thrilling as it should be. I think splitting the film between two protagonists hurt it, as neither are given enough time for their stories to really be told well. Either one of them should be emphasized, or the film should be made longer. Still, it's a beautiful film, with a fantastic score (favourite of the year for me) and great direction.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Noticeable western consumed by production values</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Proposition seemingly has all the ingredients to give the Western genre it's routine half-decade adrenaline shot of vitality- gorgeous cinematography, stunning production values, and an authentic and talented cast, and still it fails to convincingly tie together all of the parts into the one overpowering whole it sets out to achieve. Though masterfully shot and meticulously rendered via set design and wardrobe, the pace struggles between visceral action and stoic dramatization, with relative unease. While balancing the brutal and primal back-lands of late 19th century Australia with the mannerisms of polite society or the virtues of silence in nature, the film, rather then leaning towards it's implied poetic edge, feels more stifled then it should. I'm sure many were blown away by the script notoriously dark musician Nick Cave whipped up, impressive no doubt, but any full fledged endorsement would still somehow be negating the scripts awkward spots. Cave's greatest contribution naturally is his score which, despite some strange choices, helped modernize the action in a compelling way, given the stiff period-piece objectivity to counter. Despite some significant scenes of intensity, whether it be through the shocking and graphic violence, or the soulful, dirty performances, this Proposition is one worth taking merely for artful entertainment, and unfortunately not the highbrow masterpiece some are claiming.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Since I first heard Nick Cave was writing a screenplay for John Hillcoat I had been eagerly looking forward to this film. I was disappointed but only because I believe he could do better. I'm not sure why I was left with such an empty feeling leaving the cinema but it definitely wasn't because all of the characters were so dislikeable. I don't agree with the notion that some of the characters must have some redeeming features. It was more that it looked like one of Quentin Tarrantino's more shallow pieces of work or worse. I don't think the violence was gratuitous at all but it wasn't backed up by a very strong story and all of the characters were very simplistically developed. And the awkward attempts at poetic sentimentality made me cringe. The soundtrack was one redeeming feature though.Some day a movie will be made of And The Ass Saw The Angel and this will be quickly forgotten... I hope.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Very Overrated Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After reading a dozen or more of the comments in this section, I must side with the naysayers. The first half-hour of the film offered some promise of character development, plot twists, suspense, surprise, etc. Absolutely NONE of these things occurred. Winstone's local sheriff is introduced as a supreme bogeyman then promptly becomes a confused husband for the rest of the film. Pearse runs the gamut of emotions from A to B, barely. The townsfolk, few in numbers probably to save money, are almost comical in their zombie state; stumbling around drunk only stopping to rant and/or stare. The actor playing the youngest Burn brother does little but squeal in terror. The older Burns is the devil incarnate, though we have not a clue why.We never learn one of the most intriguing plot facts, such as why the three Burns brothers raped and killed a settler family. This pulls at a viewer because both characterizations of the younger two brothers - what little is provided - suggests that the two could not be guilty of such atrocity. John Hurt's bounty hunter is almost comic relief, serving no real purpose. Finally, the mayor, or local bigwig, seems to represent someone or something totally alien from the climate and all the other characters in the film. Ironically, this split between the bigwig's interests and the rest of what you see in the movie is the closest thing to contrast in the whole thing - the rest of things simply represent banality, boredom, evil and debauchery.For a real laugh watch Guy Pearse's interview in the extra's. Mr. Pearse redefines in-articulation and deftly manages to say less than nothing in five minutes of speaking.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good film that falls short of being great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Australian film industry is having one of its periodic surges, with a number of interesting films popping out at the same time (as opposed to inane comedies that no-one goes to see, of which there are plenty). One of these is "The Proposition", an 'Australian western' written by singer / writer / ex-PJ Harvey boyfriend Nick Cave.In short, brothers and outlaws Charlie Burns (Guy Pearce) and Mike Burns (Richard Wilson) are caught by Captain Stanley (Ray Winstone). Stanley gives Charlie a proposition - either he goes and kills his older brother, Arther Burns (Danny Huston) or his younger brother Mike will hang in about a week's time. Arthur is responsible for an atrocity that happened to some landowners who were friends of Stanley's wife; Stanley wants revenge for what happened.Everything else in the movie falls out from this proposition. Charlie wrestles with his task (well, to some degree) while Stanley starts to come apart under the strain of keeping the secret from his wife (Emily Watson) while under increasing pressure from the community to do something with the Burns brother he has.All in all, this film lacks that certain "something" that would make it a great film. The acting is superb, the set-up interesting, the landscape is incredible and some of the dialogue is great. However, the pace of the film is very slow through the second act and you can't help wishing something would happen. This movie is very much a tragedy in that the audience can see things aren't going to go well for the characters from the very beginning - the only question is how far wrong things will go.Also, I'm fairly certain that some more sophisticated audiences will find Cave's screenplay to lack any subtlety - some scenes just scream, "hear what that character just said? FORESHADOWING!!!". "The Proposition" also contains a fair amount of gore, so if you feel that seeing someone's head explode isn't for you, then you should probably stay away.I'd recommend seeing it for those people who are big fans of westerns (in the mould of "Unforgiven" rather than "Calamity Jane") and want to see what another country's take on the genre is like, those who want to gain some insight into the insanity of the British for colonising outback Australia and those people who like their revenge dramas slow and bloody.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Australia at the end of the nineteenth century a barren and hostile place where people have little respect for human life. Captain Stanley (Ray Winstone) captures two well know crooks and rapists the Burns brothers Charlie and Arthur (Guy Pearce and Richard Wilson) after a shootout. The two men have a third brother who is part of the gang who Captain Stanley also wants to capture. Therefore, he lays a proposition onto the table that if Charlie kills his brother he will let Arthur go on his return. Charlie accepts and begins to seek out his brother, but will he return with the proof that he has fulfilled his part to the proposal? I expected far more from this, it had been built up a great deal in advertising and had got favorable reviews so I had high expectations. Unfortunately this was a slow and dull picture that brought nothing new to the Western genre, it was a million miles away from matching the excellence of Sergio Leone Westerns. The film plodded along, coming to a very predictable end without satisfying at all. The acting was fine although John Hurt's fine acting skills were wasted on a stupid part and Pearce was 'safe' as ever in his role. The cinematography was good and shots of landscapes were nice to look at but thats not why I go to see a film. I wanted a unique story, diverse and idiosyncratic characters, a good score and something to remember that stays locked in your mind for a couple of days after. This was certainly not it, a boring conventional film that was a waste of time, I wish I had re-watched a decent Western like the 'Good the Bad and the Ugly' instead.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Emily Watson Shines Like A Supernova</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While this film is nothing extraordinary, Ms. Emily Watson certainly is and she is absolutely brilliant in what easily could have been a throwaway role. It was a fantastically imaginative casting choice by the director to choose Watson as what he probably wished would be more than the typical "frontier wife." He got much, much more as Emily Watson gives a performance of subtle sexuality, passion, and courage. In doing so, she does what she usually does and makes this film her own. It takes tremendous talent and incredible power for her to step forth from this group of male actors and in beautiful fashion demonstrate her exceptionality as an artist. She breathes life into what could have been a stale stereotype and sets fire to the screen in several stupendous scenes. The only problem is she is underused and the camera spends too little time on her glowing face and blinding cinematic presence. However, what she does with the camera time she is given is miraculous and for that reason this film is a 10. Watson is indeed the most powerfully talented and divinely gifted actor working in cinema today and she continues to astonish audiences with each succeeding performance in a way that no other actor can touch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Whilst by no means a terrible movie, The Proposition adds nothing to an already done-to-death genre, namely Westerns.The plot is thin and could have made an acceptable TV episode, but instead its spun out into a movie with the addition of pointless travelogue songs and the occasional (not occasional enough!) bouts of philosophy and drivel spouted by some of the characters.The backstory to the characters is almost non-existent. We are told they are a band of ruthless outlaws and degenerates and their crimes are hinted at, but never shown. This is at odds with the rest of the movie, which gleefully shows the effects of violence with gusto.None of the characters are particularly likable, which leads the viewer to not really care one way or the other whether they live or die. And, when you don't care about the characters, it's hard to care about the movie as a whole.The Proposition is slow, uneven and filled with well...filler. At the end, I was glad it was finished so that I could go and get on with something more interesting and rewarding.SUMMARY: Tedious and unsatisfying. Watch Unforgiven, or Deadwood for more visceral and intelligent Western drama. This one is really not worth the effort.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A little too Shakespearean for my taste of westerns</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK, honestly i was intrigued by the premise, and that this was a western, and one with Guy Pearce in it. My idea of a western is not necessarily a bloodbath or slurring cowboys but i surely did not expect the kind of Shakespearean fest that this one is. The cinematography is excellent, the sights are awesome and the sets look realistic, but the story progresses a little too slowly for my taste. Also, it could have been explained better, but he i guess it wasn't because that is the point of these artsy things. You have to look into the little details and make up your own mind and explain scenes with words such as 'ironic'. Like towards the end when, over dinner, Martha thanks the lord for what they are about to receive and the Burns gang busts in and tortures her husband.What is worse is that the shootings and the 'knife-work' is mostly shown off-screen through sound effects. Well, at least it was too less for my taste. It had the capacity for some as evidenced in the scene where an aboriginal spears Guy's character and them has his head blown off. I wouldn't have mind all the singing and the other Shakespearean stuff in there if the movie was also true to the violence as it was to the singing.The worst part, though, is that i could not really get any of the characters. All of them were under-defined and all of them seemed depressed. I mean not one character was happy when sober. Not one!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you loved "The Passion of the Christ," you will love "The Proposition." At all times, every character on screen is covered in either blood, flies, bat droppings, or all of the above. This is as gruesome as it gets. "The Proposition" is set in colonial Australia in the late 1800s, when the British were trying to rule a wild land with an iron fist. A young boy is publicly whipped forty times, and the camera doesn't shy away from showing his ravaged back and the blood-soaked whip. Prison guards are decapitated. On Christmas day, the British army captain is shot in the shoulder and forced to watch while his wife is raped, and everyone dies. Personally, it's not my idea of a good time at the movies, but guys who love bloody and violent western movies will love "The Proposition." The story was superbly told and the actors brought you into this hell. Not a place I want to visit again any time soon.</fullReview>

It's also just a wonderful fable, told with stunning art direction, mise-en-scene and suitable performance style. Nick Cave's personality oozes all of this droll laconic murderous ballad.... and it's a wonderful crossover from auteur musician to writer.

		<fullReview>This is one of those special films that gradually reels you in. It's a shame it doesn't seem to have been well publicised, since the box office is quite poor considering the generally favourable critical reviews it received.The story is set in the (late 1800's I'd guess) Australian outback and you really do get a sense of the colonial lifestyle. The Burns brothers are responsible for some grizzly crimes and the police officer comes up with the inspired plan. There are 4 brothers and one of the brothers is given a proposition that requires him to murder the most dangerous of the brothers.The film is very well acted by the entire cast and whilst the names cannot guarantee a good box office they can guarantee good performances. Whuilst Guy Pierce and Ray Winstone take the honours John Hurt also hams it up with a great cameo. Whereas with many films you do not really get an even basic understanding of the main characters with this you get under the skin of several characters. The diversity of the characters and the switches between violence and tranquillity is extremely well done. Excellent</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bad Proposition</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a haunting, well-produced, well-acted 'story' of a host of irredeemable characters in what has to be one of the ugliest and most God-forsaken areas on earth. As the policeman, Capt. Stanley, Ray Winstone is the closest any of the male characters get to being human. Yet he is as flawed as can be. He and his wife (played woodenly by Emily Watson) live in a fantasy home stocked with their treasures from an apparently more civilized past. Stanley tries to shelter his wife from the stark evil all around them, but cannot.The 'heroes' of this tale are a gang of murderous rapists, led by older brother Arthur (Danny Huston). Middle brother Charlie (Guy Pearce) is pressed by Stanley to kill Arthur in exchange for considerations for Charlie himself and the youngest brother, Mikey, who is apparently a congenital idiot. The police are, of course, a pack of sadistic cowards who periodically go about killing blacks for sport.In the process of playing out this tale of hatred and revenge we are treated to spearings, floggings, heads blowing apart, decapitations, slashings, rapes, stabbings, and rotting corpses. A brief appearance by John Hurt appears to have been thrown in as a afterthought, with no effect on the 'story'.We are not privy to the motivations of any of these people, and we can empathize with none of them, even the wife, who seems to live in a dream world. She tries, but fails, to rise above the relentlessly hideous landscape, that is occupied by human filth and hordes of flies. The whole affair is expertly filmed.This is a long drawn out bloodbath of a 'story' poorly told with lingering shots of no moment, and with no real reason to watch. Spare yourself.</fullReview>

But The Proposition isn't like that. It focuses most of its time on the story, characters and cinematography. Which i don't have a problem with, but its the amount of valuable time waisted and slow progression of the film that i don't like. Delevopment as you might already know is a key example of good characterisation in a film and it certainly shows here. The downfall however is the pacing. OK it may give the story more time to develop, but then why not make it into a three hour masterpiece instead of having to sit through one hour forty minutes of blunder and irrelevant chunks of poor pacing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>There's Still Value In "The Western"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Historically, and from a character perspective, there's still mining to be done in western films, and THE PROPOSITION gives us a great sense of both. Aussie director John Hillcoat delves into Australia in the 1880s, telling about the bloody lawlessness and aboriginal prejudices. The story centers around the outlaw Burns brothers, Charlie (Guy Pearce, L.A. CONFIDENTIAL), Mike (DECK DOGZ) and Arthur (Danny Huston, THE CONSTANT GARDNER). When Charlie and Mike are caught by local lawman Captain Stanley (Ray Winstone, COLD MOUNTAIN), Charlie is pulled aside and given a distasteful proposition: kill your brother Arthur and Mike will live. Charlie loves Mike dearly and hardly knows his other brother, Arthur. He grudgingly accepts the terms but it quickly becomes clear that he's unsure what to do. Is the killing of one family member in order to save another morally apprehensible? What if your moral boundaries are skewed? Charlie rides off to find his brother in the searing Australian Outback. Meanwhile, back in town, Captain Stanley is having great difficulty controlling its citizens once they learn one of the dreaded Burns brothers is in the local jail. A powerful bureaucrat named Eden Fletcher (David Wenham, THE LORD OF THE RINGS) demands swift justice. He orders that Mike Burns be lashed 100 times. Knowing that Mike probably won't survive this, but also battling feelings his lovely wife Martha (Emily Watson, GOSFORD PARK) has about the crimes Mike has committed, Captain Stanley is forced to give in to the township's demands. Back in the Outback, Charlie finally runs into his twisted brother and comes face-to-face with his worst fears: killing someone of his own flesh and blood. Can he do it? Should he do it? The word "epic" has been on the lips of many reviewers, but epic may be too big a term for this flick. It is enjoyable, and has sweeping views and great acting (even John Hurt makes a soulful appearance as a perverse bounty hunter), but it doesn't approach films such as LAWRENCE OF ARABIA or DOCTOR ZHIVAGO in scope. And that's okay. There are many films out there that are still very enjoyable but don't meet the epic criteria.That the western film has been done for nearly a century might make one think that it's dying out as a genre. But no. THE THREE BURIALS OF MELQUAIDES ESTRADA and UNFORGIVEN are two of the more recent favorites that prove there's still life out there for the western. And The Proposition is another excellent example that it's still got cinematic value.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this film last night knowing nothing about it except for the favorable reviews it had received. I haven't been more bored with a movie in my life. This film certainly has attractive direction and cinematography, although the story is short and simple and unable to justify the slow pace and length of the movie. In its attempts to be a "deep" film, the script is filled with long silences and whispery noises that are supposed to allow the viewer to reflect on the mood but end up aggravating everybody. Guy Pierce doesn't even need to act because, in all seriousness, he probably says about 50 words in the entire movie. The long poetic silences may make for the characters like the burdened Captain Stanley, played by Ray Winstone, but they don't really fit when it comes to drunk Australian outlaw gunmen. On top of all this, the gore and violence in this film was completely unmitigated. Don't get me wrong, I have nothing against graphic displays f violence, but I usually like it to fit in well with the story, instead of merely being momentary enterainment from an otherwise pointless movie. Typically, just like every other Western movie, this film features the regretful outlaw who must now come to terms with his sordid past by using blank stares, stoic looks and redemption through killing. As you have probably guessed, this film is about a proposition. That is literally the premise of this 2hr film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best films of the decade</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>WARNING: THIS REVIEW DISCUSSES THE ENDING OF THE FILM.In some respects, the simpler a film is, the more complex it can be. The Proposition is driven by a visceral but arrow-straight plot as soul-searching criminal Charlie Burns (Guy Pearce) is sent to kill his older brother Arthur (Danny Huston) in order to save his younger brother Mikey (Richard Wilson) from being hanged on Christmas Day. That harrowing foundation provides a blank canvas on which director John Hillcoat and writer Nick Cave paint a gorgeous, lyrical landscape of good, evil, idealism, and harsh reality.It's impossible to watch this film without realising the debt it owes to Joseph Conrad's novel Heart Of Darkness, which also involves someone being sent deep into a raw and dangerous British colony in order to assassinate a hermit-like rogue element who has taken on semi-divine status amongst the indigenous people. It is this spiritual element that lends the film so much of its power, as it allows for a far more interesting study of characters. The film is hyper-real: nothing in it is impossible as such, but everything is heightened a little bit. Thus Arthur Burns, the Kurtz of the film, is as troubling as his literary progenitor, a massively charismatic and intelligent figure who is nevertheless a psychopath given to moments of shocking cruelty (at one point asking his brother why he can't ever stop him from indulging his more excessive impulses). However, in his contemplative moments he seems to be the only character who knows where he is, able to reconcile the desire to "civilise" Australia with the unmerciful reality of the country. His flaw is that he cannot reconcile the different elements of his own persona with each other.Ideological conflict in one form or another is what drives the film; the fey and unsympathetic mayor (David Wenham) is the only character who retains a simplistic black-and-white view of events, and as a consequence seems to be permanently detached from reality. By contrast, bounty-hunter Jellon Lamb (John Hurt, in a wild performance) can only grapple with his situation by drinking himself senseless. One of the driving forces of the film is how Charlie's quest to save one brother by killing another is how it teaches police chief Captain Stanley (the excellent Ray Winstone) that human morality is not an absolutist concept, and that his initial obsessive desire to "civilise this land" is far more complicated than merely catching criminals and subjugating the natives. For me, the central scene of the film is Mikey's whipping. Stanley disapproves, realising that the young and mentally-handicapped criminal is not responsible for his actions, but he agrees to it when his wife (Emily Watson) asks him to imagine her in the place of the Burns gang's victim. The struggle between his ideological desire to fight crime ? and his love for his wife ? with his realisation of who he is really dealing with is brilliantly played, and in the event he is the only character who is prepared for the shockingly brutal result of the lashing. His wife, who seeks to turn the arid patch of land on which she lives into England, cannot cope with the idea that a criminal could elicit sympathetic feelings.As long as intention and deed cannot be reconciled, the conflict will continue even as the people involved die and are replaced. The film ends ? it cannot go further ? when Charlie finally makes up his mind about who he wants to be, and Arthur ends the film with a moment of realisation of his own, in his way. In so doing Stanley is taught a brutal lesson about his earlier overestimation of his authority: he emerges bloodied and broken, but wiser for realising that he is not, and never was, judge and jury. If the film is predictable, it is because the characters ultimately assign their own fates.Beautifully written and filmed and with largely gorgeous music (only Cave's lyrics push the cheese-boundary on occasion), The Proposition is a sumptuous masterpiece that is brutal without ever being gratuitous. See it at once, and switch your brain to 'on.' 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a well orchestrated bloodbath</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The casting was fine, the acting and directing were good. The plot was engorged with blood which splattered from one end of the film to the other. We really thought it was a bit over the top. Is it really necessary to display that kind of gore to produce a worthwhile film? Guy Pearce was excellent in his understated role. And the poet spouting brother was as good a homicidal maniac as we've seen in awhile. But the killing, maiming and bleeding got to be a bit much after awhile. Almost to the point of being camp. The Outback was well portrayed and the aborigines were handled with appropriate crudeness and the settlers were as grim a bunch as you'll find anywhere. Considering Australia began as a penal colony, I suppose there is some historical accuracy here. Not recommended for those who are offended by gratuitous bloodletting.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As an American who lives here, I have observed the cultural differences. Great film and my header says it all. It's not Wyatt and the boys but it's of the same ilk. Very good film! Oh, I just come to believe that the Ozzie's are the best cinematographers; there films are just so rich and good looking. There is a lot of violence and it is graphic when portrayed yet, that adds to the character of the film. The film is fairly fast paced and Guy Pearce definitely draws you into his character with the his look (you can smell this guy's character - talk about stress). I would definitely recommended it based on the quality of the Australian background scenes - surrealistic. If you like shoot em ups, you like this!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>slightly disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Since most reviews seem to be heaping praise on this film I thought maybe I should make a comment. It is good, I enjoyed it, but it is not great. Pretty simple really, but I can't see how all these people can give it ratings around eight.The script is average; often clichéd and generally oddly written in every scene. Most of the important writing moments are spoiled by attempts at poetic language, which unfortunately come off as unrealistic and empty sentiment. The direction is fine, but I really didn't like Ray Winstone's portrayal or how his character develops - not because of its 'challenging' depth but because that depth is badly portrayed; first as over-use of violence and then as weakness, inaction and sentimentality - complete opposites of character that I couldn't believe result just from a supposed change of mood in the character (especially the initial instance of violence, from the man who feels sympathy for his victim). The rest of the cast are fine and occasionally wonderful, and there are some really stand out moments, especially in the slick action sequences. The sound was also excellent.The cinematography, of course, is wonderful, but is used in fairly obvious and over-reaching ways, such as by magically having the outlaw father quote poetry and such. It all seems rather ham-fisted. Sorry Nick Cave, you wrote a mediocre script to what could've been a real gem. I'm just confused why everyone loves it.Many great moments, but someone else should have written it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent as a piece of cinematic art, quite poor as a movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, no matter how I rate this movie a lot of people are going to say that my rating is wrong. That is something that you probably can say about any rating for any movie. I feel it is especially true as far as this movie goes though. As you can see from my rating I was not exactly thrilled by the movie. That does not mean that it is a bad movie. Again, this you can say about a lot of ratings, especially my ratings.Okay, I guess I have confused everyone enough now so let me try to explain. As a piece of cinematic art this movie is excellent. The acting is quite good. I especially liked John Hurt as the literate bounty hunter but most of the main characters where performing admirably. The scenery is wonderful. The Australian outback makes for a excellent backdrop and it is indeed a nice change from the classical North American western sceneries.As a movie it falls flat though. In my opinion a movie should at least try to tell a story. Even if it aspires to be a piece of art it should try and tell a story that the audience can, in one way or another, follow. This movie have a basic idea of a story but it does not really tell a story. We never get to now who the bad guys really are, what they really did, except for a bunch of hints about killing and rape, or why. Heck, we never actually get to know of the guy the flogged to death where really taking part in the deed or not.Throughout the movie the bad guys are supposedly hiding in some place where it is impossible to get them so the main character tries to get the bad guys brother to kill him. Not very plausible at all. The governor, Eden Fletcher played by David Wenham, or whatever he as supposed to be was pretty much an asshole. Okay every movie has to have one but his role was never really developed. Once he managed to get the young kid, innocent or not, flogged we really do not see much of him for the rest of the movie.The end of the movie is much the same as the rest of the movie. Cinematically excellent but not much of a story. There is no real conclusion. It just ends in a sequence of well done scenes but without any real story behind it.Maybe I'm a too simple mind when it comes to these kind of movies but I, even though I appreciated the graphics that was shown on my TV-screen, I did not really enjoy it as a movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretentious Australians?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THE PROPOSITION has a great premise. An outlaw is captured alongside his younger brother. The Policeman who did it offers him the titular proposition. Find and kill his elder brother- or else the younger brother will be hanged .Sadly despite this excellent premise and an interesting setting - a Western set in the Victorian Australian Outback - the film throws it all away with poor plotting, uninteresting characters, a lack of respect for those it portrays and an over-long running time.The number one problem is that the screenplay becomes far too interested in the Policeman (Ray Winstone) and places his story on par with that of the Outlaw (Guy Pearce). Instantly the story becomes over-long in order to accommodate this second major plot. It doesn't help that, unlike the Outlaw, the Policeman has no real goal to achieve, no stakes, indeed, nothing much to do at all. This also results in a lack of characterisation for the Outlaw. Stripped of dialogue you cannot care about this enigma of a man, whilst the central question of the film - will he kill his elder brother to save his younger brother? - is never sufficiently teased. The film makes a number of other missteps. It asks the audience to sympathise with the elder brother, despite him being a murderer and a rapist (and showing no real remorse for either). It forces modern attitudes on the past, notably in the corporal punishment scene where the (mentally retarded) younger brother is whipped. At the beginning the crowd cheer but by the end they drift away, sickened. Not only does this not make sense (why the change?) but it is also historically dishonest. Victorians were quite happy with corporal punishment. The disgust of the crowd is that of the filmmakers, not that of the historical people. It also continues the tedious trend of self-hating imperial films in which all the white male characters are swine whilst women and natives are wise and sympathetic (the only character I cared about was the almost silent Aborigine tracker- who was promptly murdered).Nick Cave did the music, which all to often means long, slow, unnecessary shots of Australia set to music. Once might have been fine but every time the story starts moving they throw another of these boring musical pauses in. A handful of sub plots, such as John Hurt's character, serve only to eke out more running time. This film should stand as a perfect example of how 'artiness' can ruin a film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mostly style over substance but it's still a good movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An Australian western. How weird does that sound? Still the atmosphere and nature of Australia seems to fit the genre perfectly. It's a dirty, raw and bleak movie all in one.It's also a movie that's a bit too much aware of its own style. It often prefers its artistic and deeper meaning approaches over its true story. The movie at times definitely feels like its style over substance and it prevented me from truly finding this a great movie. Of course westerns are often about its style and atmosphere but this movie definitely over does this at times.No, the movie was not as great as I had initially expected it to be. It had a more than great concept and enough elements in it to expect this to be a fresh and original movie. It's still fresh and original all but the whole package still slightly disappoints.Having said that, "The Proposition" is simply still a good movie to watch. It doesn't have the best written story but the way it's being told still makes this a good genre movie. It's of course slow, doesn't always feature a lot of dialog and features some typical characters from the genre., that all makes this a good watch, especially when you're into 'modern' new westerns, such as movies like "Unforgiven", "Open Range" and "3:10 to Yuma".The movie has a surprising cast, with mostly Australian actors that are also well known beyond the boundaries. Best known is of course Guy Pearce and John Hurt but it's really Ray Winstone who gives away the best and most impressive performance of the movie. To me he also was the main character and I'm not too sure if the movie would had worked out as well without him.A good and original western from Australia.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than Unforgiven. Best movie of 2005?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In preparation to the much anticipated "The Road" I decided to watch Australian director John Hillcoat's previous feature - the Australian outback western called "The Proposition". Set in the XIX Century in the wild and unlawful down under in the midst of a creeping civil war or should I say genocide with the Aborigines (or 'blacks') as the mortal enemy.There may not be any Indians, but this is an essential western with lawmen and fugitives and revolvers. And of course the not so good, the bad and the ugly.Following the murder and brutal rape of a pregnant women one lawman, captain Stanley (Ray Winstone) will go to any length to capture the guilty - the notorious Arthur Burns (Danny Huston) and his gang. Former members of his gang are his brothers Charlie Burns (Guy Pierce) and the youngest Mike Burns (Richard Wilson). Captain Stanley unable to capture the oldest brother surrounds and captures the other two brothers offering Charlie a proposition he can not refuse: Kill Arthur or Mike will hang on the noose.I won't go any further on the plot, as it is brilliant and any giveaways will decrease pleasure from watching the movie. In this unlawful land good and evil are on the same side of the coin, whilst decency is a waste of life. As the film unravels I was surprised and taken back by how wrong I was about first impressions about the movie.Ray Winstone is brilliant in this movie, but its an all-round great effort from the cast, with Danny Huston and Richard Wilson also worth special mention.Hillcoat has taken a commendable approach where less is more (although he can get quite graphic and the movie is not for the faint hearted). Shots are beautiful and this movie has no time whatsoever for being corny. Stylish all the way through this movie really sets itself apart from 99% of the movie that are produced in Hollywood nowadays.If this is the road we are taking with Hillcoat's next movie I am the first to applaud.</fullReview>

Peckinpaw-grade violence? Check! Pseudo mythic plot? Check! Anachronistic (e.g. early 21st century) hairstyles and costumes? Check! Throw in uninvolving characters, hard-to-hear dialog (mumbling is so much more significant), and ripoffs from sources as diverse as The Searchers and The Grand Illusion (spare me those roses in the desert), and you have a textbook case of what a bad movie looks and feels like made by people who spent too much time in film school.I gave it about an hour and realized that I had nodded off for good reasons.

		<fullReview>I've never seen a Western before, let alone an Australian Western, but The Proposition sounded promising. Having sat down and watched a Western now, I'm not sure I'd rush to see another.Like I said, The Proposition sounded promising, but I was let down by a slow, meandering plot that really didn't seem to go anywhere. I felt as if nothing was going to happen and the bleak surroundings lent to a heavy atmosphere.In saying that, when something did happen, I was made to sit up and take notice. The violence is graphic and vicious and the acting is generally very good; Ray Winstone was excellent.I may be in the minority, but I believe with a bit of pace, The Propsition could have been a very good film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Losing the west</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like any good western, this film is about bringing "civilization" to those who are uninterested in it, but ambiguity sets in as the villains seem almost like the victims at the beginning, and when they reveal themselves later to be far from harmless, we find ourselves unsure how the film wants us to regard the idea of civilization? and that seems to be the point of it all. The main character in the film turns out to be the lawman (an capital in the imperial army though, not a sheriff) who proposes an interesting way to deal with the villainous gang, and then watches his society and even his own marriage nearly break under the strain when his choices gradually come to light. The relationships between the murderous band of outlaws are a bit murkier, and perhaps required more work to understand than I was willing to put in (especially as far as the ending was concerned). Overall, though, the film manages to be taciturn without being inscrutable, which is always nice. Certainly worth a look for the interesting questions it raises, and then refuses to answer.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Saw it, went home, got drunk, forgot about it. The movie is really really beautiful, the scenario and the music is tangled up in a bundle of scary beauty. However, the characters, if you can call them that, are very scarcely depicted. Ray Winston as captain Stanley, and Emily Watson as his wife are the closest we get to full characters, the rest are clichés taken out of a Nick Cave song. In the songs they work wonderfully, but in a film, I would say, you need something further. Unless you're Quentin Tarantino and don't give a d***. The racial points fall stumbling to the ground, because we never get beyond the point of thinking "oh right, I knew that", and that's a waste of good material. The landscape and the soundtrack earns the movie a 5, and the fact that the actors work like arses with the little they have, makes it a 6.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How could you make a bad movie with Guy Pearce, Emily Watson, John Hurt and Ray Winstone? It seemed impossible until I saw this.This had so much potential: great cinematography, great story, tremendous opportunity for character interplay.But no: John Hillcoat couldn't let the folks act out the story. Every time things start to get going, someone stops for a lengthy monologue or to wax poetic or to philosophize or to tell you what's going.Best described as a bad play set in the nasty gritty Australian wilderness. The violence is as excessive and in your face as the dialogue.It only gets up to a 4 on the shoulders of Pearce and Watson. Hurt has little to do and what he does is too loud and Irish.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For art's sake we have a couple of great characterizations by Ray Winstone and Guy Pearce. In the way of cinematography the movie scores high for conveying the God-forsaken nature of the Autralian outback. As for the story that ties it all together we start out with what may be something as neo-classic as Unforgiven, but ends up being far less than that.So what went wrong? Well, evil without any compelling goodness as a counter balance just fails to draw me in. The Burns Brothers did not draw me in. I never understood anything about the Burns other than they were just bad. I'd like to have seen why they became so bad or something. But, alas no development. So no interest on my end either.The hero, Ray Winstone, was so flawed and unlikeable I never cared at all if he prevailed or the Burns Brothers did. I guess his wife was suppose to be so tender and gentile that I would feel he was inherently a good person. I didn't though and I wondered why she'd even want to be with him anywhere, let alone the forsaken wilderness they were in. In fact, there was not a single likable character to latch on to and put a vested interest in. I call it a real failure when there were several strong characterizations by top-notch actors yet I do not care about any of the characters. It means the writing was not up to par as the performances were certainly spot on with the characters. Too sparse and too many holes which could have been filled with something to compel me to care about the story and those within it.Artistically there will be those who give this movie the highest marks, but I found the lack of any real entertainment to make it slow and plodding. In the end, the fact that I felt little interest in any of the characters made the great performances within these characters quite empty. That is why I give a movie that had potential to be a 10 point only five points. I think I'd rather watch Kevin Costner's The Postman again, because as flawed as it is I wanted good to prevail and kept watching with interest. I was actually glad when all the characters shot each other in The Proposition because that meant it was finally over. Not particularly recommended except for the "Art House Western Crowd".

		<shortDescription>Smartly Directed Disappointment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>John Hillcoat's The Proposition, written by singer Nick Cave, has a eulogistic beginning. A dirge plays beneath 1880's photos of Outback life, a solemn opening shattered as we're plunged ? in medias res ? into the capture of the Burns brothers, Charlie (Guy Pearce) and Mikey (Richard Wilson), wanted murderers. The sequence's punch ? the reflective tone against animalistic conflict ? sustains stretches of narrative that forsake character detail for archetypal flavor.Hillcoat's spatial compositions are superb. His Outback is as raw and unprotected as the characters. We learn that Mikey Burns is a hothead, Charlie his elusive protector, and there is a brother, Arthur (Danny Huston), the gang-leader they've forsaken for reasons unexplained. Their captor, Captain Stanley (Ray Winstone), proposes to spare Mikey's life if Charlie brings Arthur in by Christmas Day. The townspeople want vengeance. Stanley wants civilized justice, and to protect his sensitive wife (Emily Watson) from the grizzly details of the murders.Pearce, Winstone and Watson are effective; remarkable even considering the self-conscious sparseness of the script. Cave gets mileage from his archetypes ? these situations are fresh to him ? but the movie aims high with shades of better films; the Leone westerns, and ? in Charlie's search for his brother ? Apocalypse Now. But Arthur is no Kurtz. Danny Huston, creepy as Arthur, is given poetic fits of Irish blather to spew (the family's from the old country). Pearce, in high grunge mode, skillfully becomes the isolationist myth that Cave throws at him. He's like a Clint Eastwood drifter, but with an actor at the core. Yet the longer the film goes on, the less we care, because we're witness to the pulping of an historical moment. For all its supreme, harsh vistas and observed details, The Proposition is ultimately a smartly directed, frustrating disappointment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A totally different film from the one seen in the advert</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not the film it was marketed to beEvery so often there would be a film poster which successfully captures the imagination and entices you to watch the film. This applies even to a cynic such as myself. Apart from the array of critical appraisals sprawled along the poster, I was simply attracted by the simplicity of its premise: three brothers, one must die, one must live and the other must decide. With the picture of Guy Pearce and Danny Huston wielding pistols in the air I thought this would be a brilliant action packed devil may care thriller set in the Australian outback in the spirit of he Good, the Bad and the Ugly. Whilst the film was certainly violent leaving very little to the imagination, the film unravelled to be a frustratingly lethargic period set piece. Brother Charlie burns seems to accept the proposition to kill his brother Arthur to obtain a pardon for himself and his brother mike from the hard nosed Captain Stanley without any moral deliberation. Stanley mentions that Charlie's vicious sibling and his gang are hiding out in a remote hideout which no one dares to approach, but armed with a rifle on horseback he manages to find the hideout with relative ease. On his journey he encounters a demented bounty hunter (a brilliantly camp John Hurt) and a tribe of aborigines who hurl a spear at him. This would have been the perfect opportunity to interject much needed action and plot twists, although OTT performance and dialogue were well written. It is a shame that this inter play between the characters was not further developed into a race to outwit each other to find the killers.. When Brother Charlie finally finds Arthur, instead of seeing a brutal killer who wiped out an entire family, we see a chilled out hermit who spends most of his days staring at the sunset spewing out philosophy whilst listening to his rag tang gang singing by the camp fire. Is there any character development? Does Arthur not become suspicious about why his brother has returned ? Does Charlie not have any qualms about killing his brother and struggle with his conscience? Absolutely not. Instead of the focus of attention being on Charlie's mission to kill one brother, to save the other which is the main theme of the film, the film is more concerned with the subplot concerning Stanley and his annoyingly damsel in distress wife, who has to put up with being shunned in public for her husband's leniency towards the killers brother lying in prison, whilst carving turkey for Christmas and looking at clothes catalogues. Why was this so important? Having said that, the ever watchable Winston does a great job of portraying a man who struggles with duty and his morality. However, all of these scenes detract from the film's main plot - The Proposition. Director John Hillcoat ss clearly responsible for this imbalance and I couldn't help feel cheated by the different film advertised by the poster.</fullReview>

Bringing in only half of the goodies, The Proposition's screenplay is what seems to keep its head below the water. The production and authenticity of the film are incredible and keep it watchable throughout. Guy Pierce and Ray Winstone both turn in fantastic performances, but can only do so much with a weak script such as this. I was very excited to see this genre brought back to the screen, but not like this. There was no plot to hang on to and the climax of the film came way too suddenly, sans a real motive. The originalstyle of westerns was lost somewhere between the over stylizedcinematography and expensive, authentic props. Too bad the filmmakers did not spend as much time on the script and storyline as they did on the look of the movie. It takes a good chemistry to pull together a masterpiece and in this case they forgot the second half of the equation. Overall this film is watchable, but unfortunately too mundane to bring back the genre of cowboys and Indians that I miss so much.</fullReview>

How this film got made might be a more interesting film than this one. One suggestion for those who feel they need to see this movie is to not attend a funeral shortly before.

The Proposition is dull, false, pretentious, rotten --- the exact kind of movie that air-headed critics will be fooled by. This may be a spoiler, but as The Proposition moves along, it remains every scene as tedious and phony as the opening scenes. This picture is absolutely nothing like Clint Eastwood or Sergio Leone.

The landscape exudes the required atmospherics but it's the kind of evocative window dressing that needs to be anchored by a meat and potatoes narrative. Instead we have a skin and bones premise that looked good only on the paper napkin it was initially sketched out on. It's Peckinpah's turf alright, but he would have taken Cave's blatantly derivative script and done a dozen rewrites before a frame was shot. Cave should stick to songwriting, while Hillcoat should be forced to watch Pat Garrett &amp; Billy The Kid a few dozen times.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Perhaps I missed something since everyone seems to rate this movie so high. Let's see, what is it that I didn't like other than having sand in my mouth petting throughout the duration? No spittoons? Ah, missed those in this movie ... but, needed for the audience.This is not a movie I would bother to watch again nor recommend. It was slow, meandering and boring (well, if you get your kicks with senseless gore and a cast full of disgustingly completely dis-likable characters with no real redeeming qualities even in the era it is set, then you won't be disappointed). If this story had been based on fact, perhaps some stories should remain off screen and just be told as a fireside tale.Yes, I get it. Bad boy brothers with a bad situation with bad-boy-good boys with their big bad weapons and fists ... who duke it out with each other using the bad-good boy's bad-goodie wifey at the end. Costumes were okay, acting was okay, music irritating .. too many drawly and repetitive songs used for padding this lousy movie ... but shots of Australia were great, but you can get that in any brochure or tourist video. I began to wonder if characters from Deadwood would swagger on screen, but at least we were spared the foul language. Some filming appeared to be the same style, which made me think of Deadwood. At least I can fall back on The Nugget to appreciate the Aussie's humor ... oh, there is no humor in The Proposition. None ... nothing to give any balance to lighten the nonstop depressing tone(s) or help me from falling asleep during one long song after another. Pass me a Nugget puleeeeze.I'm sure this is probably a good story in the Aussie way of telling, but think it simply got dramatized WAY too much in this tale-telling on the screen. It is so offensive I feel assaulted .. worn out as well and I certainly didn't sit down to watch this to be tested for my endurance levels.I really did not like this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Beautiful cinematography, glorious landscape, remarkable set design and dressing, and acting that ranges from competent to outstanding should rate better than 5 stars.Character development is weak, where it happens at all. The story is presented piecemeal, with several pieces left out of the mix entirely (i.e., why did the butcher and his wife suddenly despise the Captains wife?). By the time the unusual ending has come through, the soundtrack (blessedly brief discordant passages interspersed with plodding, pointless folk ballad (Why, asked the sky, where, asked the wind, who, asked the rain, when will it end, asked the listener) has annoyed the viewer enough that the lack of motivation for any character turns into simple relief that it's finally over, and you can quit wondering why anyone is acting the way they have been - you can just leave it behind.Extra bonus points if you can find any character in the movie you'd want to spend 20 minutes with. You've just spent 104 minutes with them all, and you'll not get recompense.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Where is this place? Amateurish "Western" substitutes gore for credibility and characterization</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Despite some good outback atmosphere (which cost no more than the film in the camera), I found "The Proposition" to be lacking in almost everything except potential.I couldn't figure out where the hell this was supposed to be. Is it a town, or a military outpost? What exactly is being defended here? If it's a town, there are few townspeople - and no town. All there is is a jail house and a stall that apparently sells turkeys. No sign of commerce at all, yet they repeat a shot of a "hotel" standing by itself. Like there would be a hotel in a place where nobody goes and nothing happens! The first thing a western, or any good film does, is establish a sense of place. But it's apparent this was done too cheaply for that. They should have saved on some of the gore FX budget and used it to build a set.If it was a military outpost, why is there a total lack of fortification or discipline? Well, that's because it's not a military outpost...it's a town...with no buildings...policed by a handful of dirtball "military" who look like they sleep in ditches rather than a barracks. Whatever.The screenplay is weak. Why don't the soldiers accompany Charles to Arthur's hideout? Some gibberish that everyone is afraid to go there (or something). The bush is just the bush - the soldiers apparently go out there to kill rebels and so forth, and end up being out there anyway.At the heart of it all is the screenwriter's attempt to somehow mystify Arthur, a la "Heart of Darkness", but there is nothing fascinating in his back story. In fact there is no back story.The whole effort shows the effect of not enough working out. Scenes that should have been cut, like all but one of the riding scenes with Cave mumbling on the soundtrack, or the bathtub scene (which was apparently left in to give Emily Watson something to do), are left in - because apparently *everything* was left in. There was no critical filter of what needed to be cut and what needed to be added, like a little characterization. Or a place. In the end, it seems to be a movie for people who can just be reminded of a genre by certain cinematic cues and be happy with that, without worrying themselves with content.For me, it was a real disappointment. I had bought it, too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Overrated, long-winded, lousy acting, melodramatic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Movies like this, which wear this own self-importance on their sleeve, are often mistaken for good. In fact, most of this movie seems like about 10 other movies, bits taken here and there as needed. In other words, it ain't original. If you want to see a far better version of a 'brother Western' see the great The Long Riders. The best thing in this flick are the flies and Emily Mortimer. Much of the rest of the acting is overdone, clichéd, and hammy (it is among John Hurt's worst) and that's the fault of the director. David Wenham is downright awful--I almost laughed out loud during his scenes. The jailguards are pure cliché (can't the writer come up with anything original with them?). The writing is at best mediocre but most of hte time is truly amateurish. The scenes among the brothers go on and on and are pointless, and there is no sense of their love for one another--and without that, there's no tension or 'core' to the movie. Guy Pearce is often good, but in this flick he is just an empty shadow of himself, with long hair, and looking angry a lot of the time. It isn't his fault--he is not given any material to work with, and the director is clearly out of his depth. The brothers look at the sun and moon a lot and gawk at it, saying clichés to one another. No one seems to quite know what they are doing or why, so there's a lot of standing around waiting for the ending. It is watchable and it is better than pure Hollywood blockbusters like Armageddon--but it isn't much better than that, and gets plenty tedious at times. Wait for the video and rent it only if you've really got nothing better to do. Better yet, rent The Long Riders, The Wild Bunch, or something genuinely good. This flick isn't.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not surprised that Nick Cave wrote this violent, meaningless film or that, according to the Trivia section, it only took him three weeks. Are any questions answered by the development of the plot? Do we learn anything about the characters that we don't know in the first 10-15 minutes? Is anything in the dialogue memorable (other than an Australian settler weirdly quoting Dorothy Parker's line "What fresh hell is this?", in reality spoken half a century later)? I found it an ordeal to sit through this till the end and did not feel enlightened or enriched in any way. (Comparisons to No Country for Old Men are an insult to that movie.) Nick Cave's songs always feature his lugubrious drone, polysyllabic lyrics and obliviousness to their own sophomoric, pseudo-intellectual ridiculousness. You'll hear them on the soundtrack and they go nicely with this movie. Enjoy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Guy Pearce: The Man to Bring Back Westerns? Nope.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Guy Pearce stars as convict and outlaw Charlie Burns. After making a deal with the warden (a "proposition") he is sent out into the outback (this is an Australian western) on a mission. He meets up with some spiritual travelers, and some gunplay happens. But the desires of the outlaw, the warden and the people are in conflict, and you know what happens with conflict in the Old West.Normally when I watch movies, I watch them with between 80 and 100 percent attention. Unfortunately, this film received about 80 percent of my attention. And that is why I have to give it a 5 out of 10 rather than something higher -- because I was unable to properly follow the plot and keep the characters straight. Maybe some day I'll watch it again.I have heard people say this film was going to revive the Western genre. Well, it's been two years, and with the exception of this year's "3:10 to Yuma", I just don't see that happening. What this film has going for it is the same thing it has going against it: the story is more dense and well-constructed than your average film. I came in expecting guns blazing, and that is a relatively small part of the film. So, action fans might be disappointed. Those who desire good writing will be pleased. (Normally, I'm in that group -- but as I said, I wasn't as dedicated as I should have been and the plot went over my head.) I cannot give this film a firm recommendation or denial. I would watch it again if someone asked me to, though I'm not particularly a Western fan. I do like the setting being in Australia, as that provides a twist not commonly seen in Westerns (though I suppose it's a sizable subgenre if I looked hard enough). Conclusion: not a casual, drinking movie.</fullReview>

The running time of 104 minutes is about 30 minutes too long, It may have been a better film at 74 minutes. There was very little to like about this filmThere is also a very bloody whipping scene,which is poorly executed, I am a devotee of whipping scenes &amp; this one is one of the worst. If you like Whipping scenes, see either of the following 3 movies, THE CLAIM; STARSHIP TROOPERS; and DRAGONARD. None of these 3 are good films, BUT they have something "the proposition' does not have,humour &amp; some likability.Rating **(out of 4) 62 points (out of 100) IMDb 5 (out of 10 )</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a rather pointless movie. I enjoy Westerns, even spaghetti Westerns but this just didn't happen. The characters are never developed and the plot wanders all over the place. Even by the end of the movie we know almost nothing about the characters. The story never makes any sense. It wanders all over the place and is difficult to follow. The ending is really bizarre.The John Hurt episode is one of those episodes that makes no sense at all.I like Hurt but the episode contributed nothing to the story. It was artificial and probably only inserted to give the movie more star power and maybe stretch the story out.Emily Watson added nothing to the story and seemed to be out of place. It was a role that seemed to be written in at the last moment.The movie can best be summed up by its title "The Proposition" a title which has been used frequently in the last ten years. The only reason I gave this flick 3 stars is because it so aptly and realistically depicts the bleakness and starkness of the Australian Outback and the seediness of the people who live there.</fullReview>

The brothers are accused of raping and killing the pregnant girl friend of the Captain's wife, among many other things. These intricacies cause all kinds of problems for the captain and the 'good' brother. Then the mayor of the town gets involved and screws up the deal by killing the younger brother. As things go this film is slow, but just interesting enough to keep your attention. Technically a good film with lots of good sequences and scenery.

		<shortDescription>Managed to make it through</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, I did manage to make it through to the contrived, unnecessarily unresolved, bitter end. Now, folks, I have seen a lot of movies. And I even been to college and got a couple of degrees in theatre--maybe relevant, maybe not. This film was lacking in two things, namely, a director and a writer. I know there are a couple of names in those credits, but they were certainly asleep at the switch during this project. There are some pretty pictures of sunsets and such, and a bunch of nasty, bloody, scenes, including dismemberment, beheading and disembowelment. But what does it all mean? There are some feeble attempts at Christ allegory with 39 lashes at a cross-shaped whipping post, and a spear through the heart and all that...... Come on! There is indeed something like a through-line to the plot. But there just isn't enough dialogue to carry it along, or to make it transcendent, or to convey anything of any real meaning or theme. The director, instead of creating an artistic whole, went for nothing but cinematography and "neat-o" violence. And I imagine that he must have deliberately crippled the performances of some very fine actors with something that he considered to be style. John Hurt, God bless him, makes the most of the crumbs of dialogue dropped his way. The designers may have been on to something, thematically, although at first I thought it was merely another monochromatic western. The new-age soundtrack is musically incoherent. Anyway, if you haven't understood anything of what I've written--or if you understood it and think I'm an academic stuffed shirt who doesn't understand anything about the real world of Independent/Aussie film-making--or if you just like gratuitous violence and gratuitous shaky-cam--this may be the movie for you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you have trouble sleeping pop this DVD in and in 20 minutes tops you will be snoozing. The acting is great, but it lacks ANYTHING to keep you interested. There is NO excitement, the sound quality isn't the greatest, for most of the movie the actors are mumbling and the music is something more suitable for ambiance CD's than it was for a movie like this. The story had potential and the casting was good, but the director really fudged up this movie. About 40 minutes into the movie it felt like it had been 2 hours. In the scene where Mike was getting a lashing it feels like that scene was 15 minutes, the music for that part wasn't the best choice and I don't understand what emotion we (the viewers) were supposed be feeling. Like I said, it was just a boring movie, Guy Pierce's character mumbles some sort of poem or something when he rides his horse and it adds nothing to the movie, it is just annoying having to try to understand what he is saying and volume control it, which happens a lot in this film.</fullReview>

The violence was relentless and seriously disturbing. I think I will have nightmares about it.The scenery was impressive, and the movie was effective in creating a menacing, threatening atmosphere. But it's not actually a very good movie. It's melodramatic (not surprising, that's almost a trademark of Nick Cave). It is annoyingly slow at times and the changes of pace between the shocking violence and the slowness elsewhere are jarring. And the dialog is downright amateurish.The movie is very emotionally affecting, but that's by virtue of the brutality of the storyline. I don't feel it made any profound statement about anything, or that there was much point to any of it. It left me feeling cheated that I experienced so many negative emotions without taking anything from it.</fullReview>

Every character is a cardboard stereotype. At first one suspects over-acting but on reflection one realises that even the best of actors can do nothing with such an appallingly hackneyed plot and dialogue. I notice a number of commentators have praised this movie enthusiastically but it is clear that they are Australians whose patriotism has entirely overcome their judgement. However if you are very keen on landscape photography there is a case for renting this as a DVD; but you must watch it with the sound turned off to avoid a nauseating experience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not a writer nor movie expert. This heads the very short list of the worst movies I've ever seen. We see some lovely cinematography of the Australian desert, although they did show the identical sunset and couple of desolate vast desert scenes about twelve times each. UCLA film students could get these outside Vegas. Otherwise, start to finish, there was filth, violence, noise, cheap startle-tactics, gratuitous very excessive blood-and-guts, schoolboy philosophizing, laughable poetry whispered on a c-minus soundtrack. Flies buzz eternally, pathetically trying to ram home a little allegory about Man's inner decay from evil, or some such rot. Plot is nearly nonexistent, yet dozed. The pacing was so boring and slow I literally went over some bills and my laundry list in my mind. Lord, give that director some thyroid. Tea took 50 seconds to pour and stir. Man gazes into distance in silence alone, for about 45 seconds. There was protracted loud urinating, and turned - up volume during eating and grunting. Every theme and event was a cliché. Man's violence, degradation, cruelty, sexist gunslinging bullies, lawmen abusing power. Smattering of the noble savage. Rarely do we see such on the big screen. Westerns went out 30 years ago. And this is a bad one. Worst of all: I've seen some favorable notices which to me screams big (Australian?) marketing payoffs. Possibly those behind this film haven't the sense to be ashamed. Come on. I was embarrassed for them throughout.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>tedious, amateur big budget student film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was really looking forward to seeing this film after reading great pre press. Whenever I see a film that wants to be down and dirty, to capture the spirit of a particularly rugged part of a nation's history, it is always most disappointing and for me instantly disengaging when the main characters look like they are from a separate, superior gene pool in comparison to the supporting extras cast which does look like the real deal. Having a supporting cast of chinless, ugly leathery, slightly diseased, rabid sweating half-witted, uneducated inbreds makes for an authentic overall human texture but when Guy Pierce spends much of the film looking like a male model in 'outback' costume, while his brother who is a genius philosopher with Rasputinlike power and their aboriginal companion appears to have a university degree, then somewhere I'm feeling that it's all a bit contrived. All the other characters are great, the police, the local tribe of aboriginals, the townspeople, but the superiority of the main cast utterly destroys the integrity of the film. The story itself is so tedious and uninteresting, we never know who any of the main characters are, we never get to empathize with anybody enough to care what happens to them because we never really see anything of any note happen until the climax. The film is like a ballad and is nicely shot, but there is too much time spent on pointless, featureless and banal duologue's between characters that amount to nothing and go nowhere. Nick Cave might be a great front-man, and lyricist, but that does not automatically make him a screenwriter, which is another craft in itself, and not an easy one mind you. Press say he wrote it in 2 weeks, and I'm sorry but it certainly looks like it, the story is fragmented and lacks any cohesion towards story and drama. I found myself not caring at all about anybody, I was neither shocked, upset, moved, aroused or motivated. The film relies on overall tone (soundtrack, art direction and texture) to create an 'emotional' feeling, rather than story points and character development to create response. I thought this film was possibly one of the weakest efforts of recent Australian cinema, considering the topic and era, it was twee and accessible, and having a few rather unconvincing bloodbaths doesn't make it brutal. It just seems to me that if Nick Cave hadnt written this it would not have been made. How far you can go by being one of the coolest 'dudes' in town here never ceases to amaze me. Sure he is a great cultural icon and has led an inspiring life, but that does not make him a genius with everything he touches!!!! If you want to see something about a similar era that relies on terrific character and storyline and superb casting, check out the HBO drama series 'Deadwood' which captures the spirit of frontier life with a disturbing realistic resonance.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Nick Cave has got 2,5 talents. One is his ability of getting handsome suits and the other is boasting about his drug use in the past. The half one is a rather average skill as a rock artist. Sometimes Cave seems to be someone who's eager to impress us about his manhood. But I don't think he likes to hear people saying such things to him.This so called script takes us to Australia in the end of the 19th century. It's hot and there's flies and there's rather much blood and there are people who aren't even one-dimensioned. They are quarter-dimensioned! Emily Watson really ought to think about her career, and her acting lessons, because since long ago her face has frozen in one expression. But at least it's more than 1/4 of it, which can't be said about the other actors (see above).One of the few nice things which can be said about this, is that the plot goes one rather smooth, even if there sometimes are just "still life" scenes. Somebody must have helped Cave writing that. The violence is brutal, but you've seen worse. This is a childish movie and a childish script from someone who has to grow up. And surround himself with at least SOME persons who dare to say no to him.</fullReview>

There are typical problems of phony Irish accents, gratuitous violence, and a lot of miscasting. All the good guys were bad and the bad guys were good, which is okay if you can pull it off but in the end there were no likable characters in the film. For a variety of reasons this film is a shocker but surprisingly a lot of people like it. If you like violence this film has plenty and with graphic close-ups, but I hated the dialogue and the acting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Sad Version of a Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film might have been a respectful effort if only the pointless and graphic gore had been cut. This level of violence disrupted the storyline and undercut the visual positives of the landscape in which the story took place.It is sad that a generation of young men (the target market for this kind of movie) have been so warped by what is supplied to them as acceptable leisure time (video games that use body counts to keep score to name one), that this movie is what they enjoy watching.This movie had no point but to indulge violent adolescent cravings. If ninety percent of the graphic scenes were edited out this could have been and interesting and memorable motion picture.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The proposition will set westerns back a hundred years</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The proposition is a Australian western that is so bad it could set the standard for how not to make westerns again. One thinks of the truly great western movies like high noon, Shane, the pale rider, this is nothing like the above named movie. The script is horrible, the acting even worst, you will find yourself rooting for the flies that seem to appear in every scene in the movie. Why do they make a movie like this, there cannot be much of a audience as it had a limited release and plays to almost empty theaters. We viewed this movie with twelve other people in the theater, after the movie ended the comments leaving the theater were that this was probably the worst western ever made. The movie is gory and all attending should be given a refund of there admission. This is one movie that I van honestly say that I would rather go thru root canal then see this again. Please do yourself a favor and miss this terrible production.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well made. Pointless viewing endeavor</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A film about how painful being stabbed and whipped and shot is and how much that happened in the outback.On leaving the cinema I struggled with my conclusion. The movie was 'ok' I thought. But as time went on I started hating it more and more. Why did I have to see that? What was there special and original in it? What a waste of time. Hasn't everyone seen this a million times? One particular whipping scene disturbed in it's similarity to the scene in The Return Of The King where 'Lord Faramir' rides out to certain death, while back in Minis Tirith Pippin sings a shire poem, each scenario intercut with each other. This scene is transplanted into The Proposition where a young man is whipped close to death. Instead of Pippin we have a bandit pointlessly standing up and singing in a rocky outcrop intercut with the scene. Not only does this lack any strength in it's awkward premise but the presence of David Wenham (this time playing a mean-spirited high status character derivative of melodrama) makes the similarity all the more disturbing. Of course this is only one example of the jarring feeling of 'haven't we seen this all before". I am sure the makers like to herald themselves above the apparently unoriginal Hollywood tripe but they are much the same.I am left with the feeling: why did I see this. What a pointless task to go through.Positives? Well acted. Good music, cinematography. Even the directing and writing was effective and dramatic just misplaced.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a bad, bad, movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can't believe I lost 2 hours of my life seeing this movie!!!! And it was the 7,5 after IMDb votes that made me see this movie. Everybody expects from a western movie fast paced action, gun shooting, atmosphere etc. I saw long empty talks (and even singing) that left me with nothing, with a linear story with absolutely no twists of any kind, bad scenery and zero atmosphere. Not to be seen in a theater or at home. How could anybody give this movie such a high mark i cannot understand. I could find nothing to like in it!!! Every movie must let something behind. This movie left the relief it was over. Even the end is so sudden</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why did this movie open at the SF film festival?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was surprised that this film opened the San Francisco Film Festival, for I left the theater highly disappointed. The violence was gratuitous, the characters completely unlikable - which by the way... If you make a film have ONE likable character. The script was slow, the pacing even slower, the editing yep... Even slower. I know SF loves Nick Cave and I too respect him as a musician... But that script was terrible. The best thing about this movie, by far, were the performances. Guy Pierce is a great actor, it's unfortunate that he wasn't given better material.Overalll, slow, disappointing, and depressing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Proposition</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I might have heard about this from Jonathan Ross or seen a small trailer, but I was mainly attracted by apparently lots of violence, and the cast. Basically it is the late 19th Century, Charlie Burns (Memento's Guy Pearce) and his brothers are all outlaws accused of heroine crime. He is captured by lawman Captain Stanley (Ray Winstone), and he is given the proposition of the title: kill his older brother Arthur (Danny Huston) and get a pardon, or let his younger brother hang. He has nine days to find Arthur, and bring him back, preferably just his head. Also starring John Hurt as Jellon Lamb, The Lord of the Rings' and 300's David Wenham as Eden Fletcher, Emily Watson as Martha Stanley, Richard Wilson as Mike Burns, Noah Taylor as Brian O'Leary, David Gulpilil as Jacko and Tom Budge as Samuel Stoat. The performances are all terrific, but for me the reason to watch the film are the mini battles, and obviously the violence is very visceral, the younger brother's blood drenched back being whipped is similar to the disturbing image in The Passion of the Christ. Very good!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>They blew it!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For people who worship Nick Cave for being Nick Cave - you will adore this over-Rated tripe.I found there was nothing deeper than a one dimensional relationship between the viewer and the leads...Did any one really give a damn??Such a crazy and colorful era of Australian History... And they blew it!Was it just me? Or is the Soundtrack actually as annoying as I interpreted it to be?I have nothing against Nick Cave... I understand he wrote this story in 3 weeks.. Does anyone else believe he should have asked for some help??Happy watching..</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I give this film a 3 , very disappointing and predictable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had heard great reviews about Proposition, however after viewing i felt the only stand out features where the landscape, dry,hot,isolated and so many flies. the story lacked integrity and reminded me of the American stereo typical outlaws. Why do Australians continue to attempt to recreate American style film we have so much creativity and talent. Bring on more true Aussie drama, lets not follow the Americans we are intelligent viewers and have high expectations regarding Australian Drama. The film had some interesting moments, the violence was a bit over the top and may not have been necessary. I enjoyed the landscape and i felt very well filmed the outback is harsh this came through in the film, again my main comment was the American overtone all rather tedious and over done.</fullReview>
