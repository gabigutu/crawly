		<shortDescription>The Most Sensational, Inspirational, Celebrational, Muppetational</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Muppets is essentially flawless. I know this is a weird way to start a review, but I feel I should just forego formalities and cut to the chase. This year has been a fairly disappointing year for movies, but The Muppets just about makes up for it all by itself. It's an absolutely life-affirming tribute to beloved characters and memories that should have never been allowed to fade into obscurity, and if you care at all about movies you need to see this, as soon as possible. Jason Segel, along with co-writer Nicholas Stoller and director James Bobin have made a film that is just absolutely bursting at the seams with affection towards the Muppets, and that love and passion has instantly rocketed this movie to the very top of the list when it comes to long history of Muppet shows, movies, and even viral videos. The film is one of the funniest movies I've seen in a long time and accomplishes this without being crass or cynical; it's smart, witty, and most importantly, completely heartfelt. Jason Segel with his obvious and undying love for the Muppets is, by all accounts, the most deserving person to be given creative control of the Muppets since Jim Henson himself. The original Muppet Movie will always be a timeless classic, and it's charm and legacy will likely never be topped by another Muppet movie. However, The Muppets is the closest it has ever come, and, due to the timeliness and poignancy of the story, I would argue that right at this moment it is more relevant and moving than even the 1979 classic. I was unable to stop smiling during the entire running time of the movie, even while tears were coming to my eyes. I know I'm not really reviewing the movie right now, and I'm more just beaming about how much I loved it, but really, I feel it would be a disservice to go into details about this movie. Simply put, you need to see it, and if you don't you're robbing yourself of a truly extraordinary film experience. This is the most sensational, inspirational, celebrational, Muppetational movie of the year. Go see it. Right now. I mean it, go buy tickets for this weekend, and you can thank me later.

		<shortDescription>Not Sensational, Inspirational, Celebrational, or Muppetational</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Muppets" plays the music and lights the lights, but it's not sensational, inspirational, celebrational, or even muppetational, and that's the most disappointing thing of all. What we have are two movies vying for the same space, neither emerging victorious because they're not handled particularly well. On the one hand, we have a soppy, innocuous love story between Jason Segel and Amy Adams, which is occasionally interrupted by musical numbers that have plenty of singing and dancing but hardly any life. On the other hand, we have the Muppets themselves, which would be fine except that they're almost completely reduced to background scenery and aren't given anything much to do. For all the effort that was put into the sets, the costumes, the special effects, and of course the puppetry, the film lacks the imagination and heart that made most of the previous Muppet films so enjoyable.In the earlier efforts, human actors were essentially supporting players. The filmmakers had enough sense to let the stories unfold from the perspective of the Muppets, all of whom were allowed to develop as characters. This is not the case with this film, which gives ample time to Segel and Adams. They play Gary and Mary, a wholesome, sunny couple from the all-American hamlet of Smalltown, where the population number on the welcome sign fluctuates due to the buses crossing the city limits. Much of the film is spent on their being deeply in love ? and, of course, on the circumstances that test their emotional fortitude. We know right from the start that their relationship is silly, but the real problem is that it's also unnecessary. It doesn't help that neither Segel nor Adams gives a noteworthy performance. Adams in particular is surprisingly out of place, spending most of her time mugging girlishly.For their tenth anniversary as boyfriend and girlfriend, Gary decides to take Mary on a trip to Los Angeles. Along for the ride is Gary's brother, Walter, who, for reasons wisely left unexplained, is a puppet (performed by Peter Linz). Mary doesn't mind ... as long as Gary makes time for a romantic dinner. Naturally, Walter is not seeing this from their perspective. Being only three feet tall and made of foam, he always felt like an outsider. He found solace only in watching "The Muppet Show," and in due time, he because the Muppets' biggest fan. His sole purpose in joining Gary and Mary is to take a tour of the Muppet Theater in Hollywood (take note, Angelinos: The Muppet Theater is actually the El Capitan ? which, incidentally, is where I saw this movie). It turns out to be a shadow of its former self, a dilapidated tourist attraction no one is interested in.In due time, Walter overhears the wealthy Tex Richman (Chris Cooper), who says he wants to turn the theater into a Muppet museum but has in fact discovered oil underneath and plans on taking it all for himself. The only possible way to save the theater, as stipulated by the Rich and Famous contract Kermit the Frog signed in 1979, is if Kermit raises $10 million by a certain date. And so Walter, Gary, and Mary find Kermit (performed by Steve Whitmire), who now lives in an old, decaying mansion in Bel Air. He decides that his only hope is to track down the rest of the Muppets and, in the tradition of the Judy Garland/Mickey Rooney backyard musicals, put on a show. But is such a thing possible? As a TV executive (Rashida Jones) eventually makes abundantly clear, the Muppets just aren't popular anymore. Under her orders, they must have a celebrity host.We see some of the Muppets being found. Fozzie (performed by Eric Jacobson) performs in Reno with a mean tribute band called the Moopets, Animal (again Jacobson) is undergoing anger management, Gonzo (performed by Dave Goelz) has become a successful plumbing tycoon, and Miss Piggy (Jacobson yet again) has made a life for herself in Paris as the editor of "Vogue" magazine. The rest are gathered during a montage. What bothers me is that just about none of the Muppets are given their fair share of screen time; they're not characters, but objects for the audience to point at and recognize nostalgically. The only exceptions are Kermit and Miss Piggy, and even then something is missing. For the first time in their decades of being paired together, they have absolutely no chemistry.Like most Muppet movies, we're treated to a slew of celebrity cameos. These would include Jack Black, Mickey Rooney, Alan Arkin, Neil Patrick Harris, Sarah Silverman, Whoopi Goldberg, John Krasinski, Selena Gomez, Zach Galifianakis, Rico Rodriguez, Jim Parsons, Judd Hirsh, Emily Blunt, and Dave Grohl. If you can think back to 1979's "The Muppet Movie," you'll recall that all of the guest stars were given more to do than flash their faces for a star-crazy audience. They played actual characters. Remember Steve Martin as the irritated waiter? I can count on one hand the guest stars in "The Muppets" who are given a purpose and are developed into anything resembling a personality. There's no reverence, only hype and a lot of one-note jokes. "The Muppets" may find an audience through its harmless tone, bright colors, and broad humor, but its thin plot, shoddy soundtrack, and badly developed characters are unlikely to appease die-hard Muppet fans ? or anyone in need of a good story.-- Chris Pandolfi (www.atatheaternearyou.net)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Greatest Possible Addition, and Tribute, to the Series</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Muppets may quite possibly be one of the best movies of 2011. I don't just mean that as a fan. The Muppets had everything spot on ? it was clever, entertaining, adorable, heartwarming, and absolutely hilarious. The magical thing though is that The Muppets pleases everybody -- average moviegoers and Muppet purists alike, and that I believe is its greatest triumph. On one side is a modern comedy, chock full of hysterical celebrity cameos and pop culture references. And on the other side is a nostalgic throwback to the Muppets era. Those who remember the old series will unquestionably find delight in seeing their favorite puppets reunite for another big show, literally.Funnily enough, the movie treats the Muppet characters as if they were real life actors, with The Muppets shows and movies being their past careers. The Muppets haven't seen any action in years (a fact also true in real life), and each muppet has taken his/her own path in life with varying degrees of success. When crisis arises, the old troupe is forced to find each other and give it another go.It is all weaved through a fascinating metanarrative that begs the question, what happens to the Muppets when they aren't The Muppets? After all this time away, can The Muppets make a comeback through a reunion and relive their former glory days? ? a question ultimately answered by the movie itself. The film opens with a common puppet named Walter, whose childhood consists of watching The Muppets and dreaming of joining them. His older brother Gary (Jason Segel) extends the invitation to come with him and his girlfriend of 10 years Mary (Amy Adams) to Los Angeles so that he can visit the Muppet studio. Much to his disappointment, the Muppet theater is abandoned and Walter even overhears an oil tycoon's (Chris Cooper) plot to tear down the place. Walter and Gary quickly seek out Kermit the Frog to reunite the Muppet crew and remedy the situation, but all the while Mary is upset that the turn of events is ruining her 10 year anniversary with Gary.As you can imagine from the premise alone, the movie is a tribute to the Muppets in every sense. It travels respectfully through the old Muppet history, and relives it instead of trying to replace it. In fact, seeing how each one branched off from the group like members of an old band and "grew up" gave, I would say, substantially more character to each Muppet than they ever had before. I think fans will agree that this is the best possible way the muppets could have returned.Simply put, I can't imagine anyone with a heart not enjoying this film. There's something in it for everybody, especially if you're in the mood for laughter and catchy musical numbers. The creative humor was a breath of fresh air. There is plenty breaking of the fourth wall and oh so much of that lovely deadpan irony and absurdist humor, reminiscent of old comedies like Airplane! The audience in the theater was cracking up almost every other moment, myself included. And while humor is its strong suit, the movie is also an incredibly heartwarming tale of friends that go their separate ways but are still connected through their hearts. Moviegoers and Muppet fans alike, go see this movie!9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A loving take on the Muppets</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are very few of us twenty-somethings who grew up without the Muppets. Between Sesame Street, Muppet Show reruns, and videocassettes of the various Muppet movies, we saw these guys all the time. We even had one or two theatrical releases of our own during the '90s. (My personal favorite of those is The Muppet Christmas Carol, which is still annual holiday viewing.) In recent years, since the very underwhelming Muppets from Space, we've seen them pop up now and again, mostly in similarly underwhelming TV projects and in short (yet hilarious!) YouTube videos. I am quite happy to say that, in this newest movie, the Muppets are back in a big way! The movie starts by introducing us to a new Muppet, Walter, and his strangely human brother Gary. Gary has planned a trip with his girlfriend, Mary, to Los Angeles, and he is taking Walter along to visit the home of his heroes, Muppet Studios. They find the studio to be in disrepair, and hear of an evil plot to destroy it. Can the Muppets, and everything we hold dear about them, be saved? To get my one complaint out of the way, I do feel that this movie was a bit rushed in places. I wanted more time with these awesome characters, and it did feel as if they were trying to get from one place to the next a bit too quickly.That said, I spent nearly the entire movie with a smile on my face. These are the Muppets that I grew up with, doing what they are best at doing, with that gently edgy humor at which they have always excelled. While there are some moments that are very touching, it is mostly very funny, with lots of nods to The Muppet Show and The Muppet Movie. While new little Muppet fans should enjoy this, it will be much more meaningful to those who have a history with Kermit and Co.Clearly made with love for Jim Henson and his creations of fur and felt, The Muppets is the most delightful movie I've seen in theaters this year.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wasn't raised on Barbie dolls, or cartoons. I wasn't in love with Duck Tales or The Secret of Nimh (in fact it scared me senseless), but I was raised to love The Muppets. Fozzie the Bear was a safe old friend who always cheered me up, Kermit was my sense of justice and reason, Miss Piggy was an exercise in the unrestrained Id, Gonzo was something I didn't and still don't understand, but he's blue and adorable! The Muppets are incredibly precious to me. And I just LUCKED out, because the newest Muppet movie was made by a fan who took all of that into account and made a film that just celebrated the glory of the Muppets. Sure there were moments of overkill, sure it sometimes got ridiculous, but The Muppets is about more than just the Muppets. It's about yearning for something pure; something innocent without patronizing its audience. This film was really clever, self aware with a great sense of humor with a giant heart. Definitely see it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film about Jason Segal, not a film about the Muppets</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was a disappointment.On the good side ? I couldn't tell it wasn't Frank Oz doing the voice of Miss Piggy, and there were some giggles to be had, and some interesting celebrity cameos. I won't spoil them, but there was some good fan service in the cameos.On the bad side ? Jason Segal. Frank Oz didn't want to be involved because of the horrible script, and I totally see his point. The movie isn't a Muppet Movie. It's a Jason Segal film, staring Jason Segal, produced by Jason Segal, written by Jason Segal, and utterly dominated by Jason Segal. Jason Segal takes up more than 50% of the film, which is horrible considering there were about 40 other more interesting characters all competing for the remaining 50% of screen time. I've never heard of him before and I never want to again. Jason Segal so utterly dominates the film that the Muppets themselves are reduced to mere cameo performances in the film.With no Frank Oz the voice of Fozzy was just peculiar. Not only unrecognizable, but occasionally slipped into being a woman's voice. Weird.The introduced character of Walter (basically, a Muppet clone of Jason Segal) is just not interesting. I didn't care about him at all, and hated the fact that his story dominated the Muppets to the point that we just don't get any story development about the Muppets themselves.Amy Adams, usually entertaining, is so dominated by Jason Segal that her character has no reason to be other than as a romantic object for Jason Segal. She's a bit of a non-entity in the film, sadly.When Jason Segal isn't on the screen, this film is quite good. Sadly, he wasn't off screen all that much.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>All you sceptics, have no fear! I was once like you, but the Muppets are here!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For all of you who are wondering if this will even come close to capturing the magic of the original Muppet movie, I just have one thing to say to you: go see this movie!!!!! I was a little worried myself that this movie would not be great, but tonight, I gave it a chance. And I left with a smile on my face. :) The story is that Gary (Jason Segel), Mary (Amy Adams), and Walter (the new Muppet) decide to take a trip down to Los Angeles; Walter wants to see the Muppet studios, but Mary and Gary are going for their 10th year anniversary of dating. There, they discover the oil tycoon Tex Richman's (Chris Cooper) plan to tear down the Muppet theater. That's when they decide to get the Muppets gang back together, and to put on one last show to raise enough money to save the theater. I'll let you put two and two together now.Warning: This just might be my longest review so far on this website. That's right: I loved this film so much that I have to ramble on and on about how much I love it.Let me first start off with the behind-the-scenes work. Jason Segel, I applaud you. You believed in this movie more than anybody else, and it is why they trusted you, my man. Thank you so much for everything you have done on this film; the result is that kids are now laughing at the Muppets, while adults are reminiscing about the old days when Kermit, Fozzie, Miss Piggy, Gonzo, and the rest would come into their TV's and bring laughter into their homes. Both generations are coming out with smiles on their faces. As for the rest of the crew, thank you so much for doing your job right. I am so happy that cgi and 3d was not used here, so thank you for not incorporating those elements.Now, to the actors (the human actors). Jason Segel and Amy Adams are perfectly corny in this, but it works here, because it's the muppets! Their little story on the side was great; it was not overplayed, it was just right. I won't spoil what this side-story is, but trust me, you'll enjoy it. Chris Cooper was perfectly evil here. I would say that he was one of the most evil characters in the history of the Muppets, but even he gets a song in this movie.Speaking of the songs, they are all so great and corny here. From the new songs, like "Life's a Happy Song," to the great old ones, like (yes, you are hearing this right) "The Rainbow Connection." They even have the celebrities in this movie singing "Mahna Mahna" in the credits. Loved every bit of it.And finally, the stars themselves: the Muppets. The trailers did emphasize Jason Segel and Amy Adams, but make no mistake, this is a Muppet film, and the whole entire gang was back. Kermit is still the normal Muppet trying to pull it all together, Fozzie still has a bad sense of humour, Miss Piggy is still very selfish, Gonzo is still trying to perform dangerous stunts, Animal still plays the drums, Rowlf still plays the piano, and all the others are doing their thing. But, let's not forget the newest addition to this wonderful gang: Walter. If you guys are wondering if whether or not he is worth watching, guess what, he is worth it! He is a really likable character, who grew up watching the muppets, and therefore has found them to be his place in life. He is a very nice addition to the family, and I welcome him aboard.Simply put, I can't stress on how great this film is. Forget about Twilight; The Muppets is where it's at! Everything about this film is great! Honestly, I don't know why Frank Oz said that he felt like this film did not focus on character development of the Muppets. Um Frank, I believe that the Muppets have been around for around 35 years now; I don't think they need that much more character development. Simply put, this movie is great. Kids will love the Muppets, and Adults will remember why they loved the muppets when they were growing up. My only complaint is that this movie should have been longer, but that's barely a complaint, since I enjoyed the movie so much that I will give it a 10/10. That's right, a 10/10 for me! Welcome back, muppets!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Muppets brought a generation of youngsters (myself included) out of Sesame Street and into a world where they didn't feel like airhead children any longer.With THE MUPPET MOVIE, Kermit, Fozzie, Miss Piggy and the gang discovered each other on a cross-country adventure that was a true odyssey. But here we've mentally gone back to Sesame Street with some silly sing-alongs, flat jokes, and an unexciting journey out of a small town where resides Jason Segel, his school teacher girlfriend, and a puppet named Walter who loves watching ? and relating to ? the original TV series.They decide to take a trip to the Muppet studio, but it's but a wasteland. And here they discover a greedy oilman wants to turn the dilapidated theater into his very own goldmine.The trio find a melancholy Kermit and they head off to collect the remaining group throughout America and Europe. Thus the road trip begins, which could have (should have) taken most of the film like the original, but it's but a fifteen-minute rushed romp where not much happens, leading to a big show where the Muppets have to raise ten million dollars to save their studio.The Muppets themselves are all present, but they don't do much nor are they individually vital to the story ? but then again, there's not much of a story to begin (or end) with.The fundraiser itself is a rushed montage of skits lacking what The Muppet Show had in creativity and humor. As for star/producer Jason Segel, whose effort to get the classic icons all back in one movie has merit, the result is too banal for what these characters, and their audience (old and young), truly deserve.And the entire film centers on the long-lost nostalgia of the Muppets during the late seventies/early eighties, forgetting all the movies made after the death of Jim Henson, which might have explained their departure. But perhaps Segel wanted to only remember the golden era; it's too bad he failed to recreate it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Jason Segel &amp; Walter Movie, featuring the Muppets...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While the "We Built This City" number really stands out amongst a few others in capturing the essence of classic Muppets, overall Jason Segel and his puppet creation Walter simply wear out their welcome. Jason Segel (Gary) and Walter (Gary's 'brother') usurp/upstage and prevent the Muppets from rightfully ever taking center stage, as opposed to eventually settling in and complimenting Jim Henson's life work. At some point the film stopped being The Muppets and more so The Jason Segel &amp; Walter Movie, featuring the Muppets. This awkwardly overbearing sentiment was cemented in one of the (borderline self congratulatory) final scenes of the film, where Segel's new 'reluctant' hero Walter is lifted up by the 'thankful' Muppets, the image on screen is brought to a still and framed in black and white...Whatever the motives were, the resulting film begins with a 'tired' Kermit who never seems to become fully rejuvenated by films end, and a Fozzie who is... a 'fuzzy' figment from Reno of his former self. Additionally, neither of the two aforementioned lead Muppet characters is appropriately voice cast. For the sake of full character comparison (voice, mannerisms, personality, role, etc.), please take the time to watch (or re-watch) one (or a few) of the films this one is supposedly intended to capture the spirit of/pay homage to (in addition to the original show itself, of course!) such as The Muppet Movie (1979), The Great Muppet Caper (1981), or even The Muppets Take Manhattan (1984). Had the Muppets really become that pathetic? Were they really long since forgotten and discarded to the ash heap of history, only to be saved with a guest-starring role by Jason Segel (who's passionate about both puppeteering and writing, granted, but is a little hard to actually connect with on screen...) and his puppet creation Walter? Or is this more possibly a case of initial good intention having crossed the line into a wee bit too much self indulgence and become a vehicle for a little (ok, a lot of) self promotion? Unfortunately, it seems the answer to that question is the latter.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is Abysmal</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have been a huge fan of the Muppets for decades. Somewhere Jim Henson is turning in his grave or should be. This is just awful. The most immediate criticism that comes to mind is reduced to one word, pacing. This drags like a corpse through the slowest zombie apocalypse movie ever made and as much as you hope it will pick up the pace, you cannot eventually help hoping that someone will put this zombie to rest with a quick head shot. I wanted to like this movie. After all, how can you go wrong with Muppets, right? You expect formula, maudlin music to tell us how we're supposed to be feeling, and incongruous shots of glee in the midst of a terrible situation that you know will somehow be fixed in the last reel. You hope for better, but you know how the predictable sells, but this? This is a movie that didn't know what it was. It could have been - emphasis could have been - a meaningful yet light and entertaining criticism of being left behind and forgotten. You know like the middle class people who used to have enough income to waste money buying tickets and renting videos for movies like this. Instead we get a feel good, Capitalist fueled commentary about combating cynicism.Amazingly, there is also bitterness painted over as humor. Miss Piggy and Amy Adams' Mary have men who've done 'em wrong. They weave as much "I am woman hear me whine" mono-normativity and passive aggressive co- dependence as you might expect from a 1950s advice column white gloves included. It sends the wrong message to young women; and the tacit expectation that men should tow the line and give them whatever they want no matter what they might want is simply appalling. It has NO business in a movie that children might see. The one ray of hope in the movie was Chris Cooper whose acceptably obvious-sounding character Tex Richman (Rich Man, get it?) provided a little Scrooge-esque energy to this latter day Christmas Carol (sans Christmas of course). Those hopes were quickly dashed, though, as he managed an even more puppet like performance than his co-stars. The one legitimately funny moment of the film came when the gang caught up with drummer, Animal, at an anger management meeting. I won't spoil it, but watch out for it, because it produced the only giggle in two hours. Cameos were dismal and apparent from an early appearance of Mickey Rooney to Zach Galifianakis' Hobo Joe to his Hangover co-star Ken Jeong. The sole bright spot among the also-ran list was Jim Parsons as Human Walter. Maybe they'll let him come back in some future installment and actually show people how funny movies are supposed to be made.I only have two thumbs but if I had more I would give this ten thumbs down.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Muppets, Welcome Back!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's difficult not to get swept up by the hype of the first theatrically-released Muppet movie in 12 years. The preview trailers have been going viral since this past summer, and the Muppets &amp; their human co-stars have been hitting the talk show circuit like never before. Audiences who don't catch on to this Muppet fever will be missing a refreshingly entertaining movie."The Muppets" lives up to most of its hype. It's a solid, stand-alone movie with a great storyline. While the film may be considered a tribute, which in many ways it is, very rarely does a tribute make a great movie. Any TV show can put the Muppets on proverbial pedestals using archive footage. "The Muppets" succeeds by breathing new life into characters we've known for years, and bringing them back down from their high pedestals so they're easier to see.It really takes a Muppet fanatic to reintroduce these classic characters about whom the movie alleges everyone forgot. In the movie, that fanatic is Walter, who is himself a Muppet that the world treats like a human being, albeit a very short human being. When Walter accompanies his best friend and roommate Gary (Jason Segel) and his longtime girlfriend Mary (Amy Adams) to Los Angeles, Walter's ultimate goal is to take a tour of the famed Muppet theater. He soon finds that the theater's glory days are long gone, and the Muppets themselves have since gone their separate ways.In reality, it's Jason Segel who is the Muppet fanatic. Segel co-wrote the screenplay with Nicholas Stoller (director of "Forgetting Sarah Marshall" (2008)), and also served as executive producer. He does a good job acting in the movie, knowing precisely when to take a step back and have the film's real stars take center stage. As a screenwriter, he also allows virtually every classic Muppet to have their screen time, as the Muppets are brought together the same way Jake and Elwood reunited the old band in "The Blues Brothers" (1980). Each character's appearance reminds us why they were so revered way back in "The Muppet Show" days.The plot involving a Texas oilman wanting to demolish the Muppet theater because there is oil underneath has been done before, but Chris Cooper, as villain Tex Richman, lives up to his clever name. He's funny while also being a convincing villain. He performs a rap number (yes, Chris Cooper raps) that is desultory, but amusing if only for its randomness.If the thought of Cooper rapping alone makes you cringe, there are plenty of other highly original songs that will wash out that memory quickly. All the songs, most of which were written by Bret McKenzie (one half of the band/comedy duo, Flight Of The Conchords), are well-written. My favorite was "Man or Muppet", sung by Segel and Walter, which was funny and poignant."Pictures In My Head", sung by Kermit, is also surprisingly touching, with Kermit's walking through a hallway of Muppet paintings adding to the sentiment. It could rank as the best Muppet movie song since "Together Again" from "The Muppets Take Manhattan" (1984). The aforementioned songs, and perhaps even "Life's a Happy Song", have strong possibilities to be nominated for Best Original Song at the upcoming Academy Awards.With all these original tunes, it's a wonder why they wasted precious royalty money on the terrible Starship song "We Built This City". Alas, this is the chosen song the Muppets sing while renovating the Muppet theater. While the songs add heart to a movie that makes the term "franchise reboot" seem too myopic, the movie would not be worth watching if it was not funny. Fortunately, most of the Muppet gags are gut-bustingly hilarious. Some gags are self-referential with characters breaking the fourth wall without even have to look at the camera. Others are the zany gags you'd expect from seeing "The Muppet Show", but are clever and hilarious too.While the trailers had their share of recent movie parodies, the film fortunately eases up on them. There's one reference to "Kill Bill", but it's slight and capricious. I also laughed at the 80's Robot.All the classic Muppet characters make their mark in ways they haven't done since "The Muppet Christmas Carol" (1992), the last great Muppet movie. The few newer Muppets that are allocated screen time happen to shine, fortunately. Walter is a great new Muppet, and has a lot of heart of which the late Jim Henson would whole-heartedly approve.Dozens of celebrity cameos abound here, but the film's strength is knowing who the real stars of the movie are and why we love them. I just hope younger audience members get the same message.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I did not find anything in this movie. Nothing in this movie, no comedy, no fun, no story. Just garbage. Do not waste your time and money to it. I went with my 5 years old daughter, She was very excited to watch this movie, but at the end of the show she was more disappointed than me. No real story at all, no emotions no, no comedy. Thanks god that I did not take my wife with me, that would waste another $12 bucks from my pocket for nothing. I would not recommend anybody to watch this movie in theater.Watch TV in home, save your money. Or help someone else but do not waste on this movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am a little bit very disappointed in that Segel Muppets movie. And he was so devoted to the 'original' Muppets creativity in his interview. The problem is, the movie spent way too much time on bad tacky musical moments. Bad tacky, not just tacky, but purposefully bad, chosen to be bad but done anyways while making jokes in the middle of it about it being bad songs. When they finally got to the Muppets stage performances all the stuff was mediocre, as if that part of the movie was written as an afterthought. Don't get me wrong, I am still a kid at heart and have an appreciation for fine immature humor but there was very little of that going around in The Muppets 2011. Lame immature humour was more like it. I got way more laughs watching 2 minutes of the Muppets Bohemian Rhapsody clip. This movie contains not one good Swedish Chef joke. Any Muppets fan I know can spontaneously spew a Swedish Chef moment, just give em an axe and prop chicken. The 'celebrity host' was nothing more than an unwilling prop. The ma-nah-ma-na card was played in lame fashion. The old farts did not even have opportunity to make sarcastic puns and jokes because there were hardly any acts to joke on. Everyone had a bit part while the screen time was gobbled up with lame song and dance bits. AND to top it off the final act just plain sucked. Some man-kid ordinary Muppet discovering his inner talent? Lame! Though if that performance was real in the sound booth that was some damn good @#$%&amp;! ....or maybe it was the $6 small bag of popcorn that got me irked...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Before reading this review you should know that I've never watched a muppet movie, so this is the first one, nor the muppet show and that I've only watched the muppets on "Sesame Street". I would say that they're lovely and also that I enjoyed them. Well the thing is that I went to watch the movie to the movie theatre and I really thought it would be funny or at least as "Sesame Street". I went with my sisters and my mother, I really had good expectations. When the movie began and I was reading the credits I started to worry when I noticed that the movie had been written by Jason Segel. Then the movie began with that annoying puppet named Walter. At first sight the movie seemed boring and I said to myself "Let's give it a chance, maybe it gets better when the muppets appear". I was wrong because all the muppets appeared and the movie was still boring and ridiculous. I don't care what people think this movie is so boring, my mother and my sister fell asleep and I was almost about to and even my 9-year-old sister was kind of mad and bored. I really don't understand what you find funny or charming about the movie.On the other hand the stars seem to be Jason Segel, his dumb replica Walter and of course the ridiculous and boring Amy Adams not The Muppets as it should be. I really got disappointed because I thought it would be lots of fun but instead it was boring and simple. I just can remember myself watching the movie at the chair with my hands on my face sad, mad and bored.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ouch!As I write this, The Muppets (2011) is rated 8.3 while the original The Muppet Movie (1979) is 7.5 and The Muppet Christmas (1992) is 7.4. This third installment is by far the poorest of the three. Henson would be rolling in his grave.Was it really wise to alienate the traditional Muppet fan-base with a plot that, in essence, says, "Grow up! Be a Man! You are too old for the Muppets." While, at the same time, providing a story so cheesy and useless that new young fans were bored to death in the seats. The only laughs (the third most important thing after having kids and something else) I saw from my 10-year old daughter were during the short, perhaps 10 minutes, that the movie simulated an actual Muppet Show.The movie is filled with jokes that go beyond self-deprecation to insulting. The attempt at turning it into a "musical" falls on a flat note with some of the worst songs you've seen since . . . well, since this movie. To actually include a scene with a kid punching his teacher in the "Punch Teacher" show in a Muppet production is unthinkable. If you didn't stay through the credits, you wouldn't even know that the Muppets still retained their theater after using physical violence to pull it off ("Oh, well! At least we tried" says Kermit to reassure his crew and cast).Are the main-line critics just to scared of Disney or the Muppet franchise to really say what they feel in their reviews? From the reviews, one would think this is the best movie of the year. It is even more surprising that some of the fan reviews put up 10s and 9s. Either I'm totally out of it, or we really have gone downhill.My recommendation . . . save your $12.00+ ticket price per person, $25+ food bill, and buy the DVD in the WalMart clearance bin for $2.99 in a few months.I now have to go watch The Muppet Movie to get my sanity back . . . what a waste.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sadly Disappointing. I expected a lot better from Jason Segel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As an enormous fan of the Muppets, this movie has been long anticipated! As a fan of Jason Segel, I had very high hopes an expectations! Jason said his goal for this movie was to bring back the spirit and the feeling of the original Muppet Movie and the Muppet Show. If that's true, then I'm afraid he failed on pretty much every level.This was NOT a Muppet movie. This was a love letter from Jason, to the Muppets. None of the characters were themselves. The mood was completely off. All but two of the many musical numbers were dry, pointless, unfeeling, and out-of-place. The film actually started out great with the plot to raze the Muppet Studios causing The Muppets to reunite and put on a show - but the love affair between Jason Segel and Amy Adams' characters took up too much screen time and basically pushed the Muppets aside. I was very disappointed in this movie. Even Muppets from Space was better than this. Its no wonder Frank Oz turned down the "opportunity" to direct the film. And its also obvious why Steve Whitmire wanted his name removed from the credits. This movie was laaaaaammmmmeeeeeeee.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Oh what could have been - Why this film doesn't work.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me open by saying that I definitely give credit to Jason Segel for his efforts in trying to bring the Muppets back. I was really pulling for you and this film...big time. In the end, I just couldn't bring myself to think positively about this film. Here's why...- First of all, this is the first Muppet movie where the Muppets aren't the stars. Not only that, it's not filmed from their perspective. Let's face it, who really cares about Segel's character and the relationship with Amy Adams? This is a Muppet movie. Let the movie be about them. If Segel really wanted to bring the Muppets back, he would have stepped to the side and let them shine.- Way too much cheese. What is up with the high brow, cheesy pun-like songs? Segel looks at the camera and sings songs like a Saturday Night Live skit. Is he making fun of the movie? Is he just too overly excited? There's a level of (dare I say it?) integrity to the Muppets that is deeply missing in the movie. The Muppets always were able to blend in with the human world seamlessly without drawing too much attention to the fact that they were, well.. Muppets. The line is very much more defined in this movie.- It doesn't feel like a Muppet movie. All the old voices/puppeteers are either dead or were not involved with the movie. I'm not just talking about how bad the new voices are (some of that can't be helped) but the way the Muppets moved and interacted as Muppets. To me it was as if the original puppeteers stopped, put all the Muppets down, and then a whole bunch of new people picked them up and did their own interpretation of how the Muppets should act. The result? You get Muppets you don't recognize. Not only that, it makes you sad because you wonder where they went. There was hardly a trace of the Kermit we all came to know and love in this movie. Same goes for Fozzie. Instead of feeling like close friends you love, they felt like strangers to me.The movie wasn't all bad. Walter was a very endearing new character and really added to the story. All of the elements were there. They just weren't executed the right way.I think it all goes back to my first point. The Muppets were the supporting cast in this movie. Everything just falls apart as a result of that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The End of The Muppets As we know it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For those of us who remember the original Muppets, this movie will be like a stab in the back to you. Disney, who now own the Muppets, have created yet another dreary movie with little or no storyline and poor additional characters all covered in a thick layer of sickly Disney gloss. So many of the Muppet characters were woefully under used or just weren't used at all!. Instead far to much time was given to song and dance numbers which didn't involve the Muppets nearly enough, and the insanely spotlight hogging lead lady, who it has to be said is not nearly as good as she seems to think she is. To boot loads of the Muppets, like Kermit and especially Fozzy Bear don't sound anything like they should do. I realise that new actors would have to have been drafted in for this, but surely they could at least make sure they sounded right before filming? The scene with Jack Black &amp; Animal in anger management had potential but never achieved it. Overall a very disappointing movie, with Disney riding roughshod over what and who the Muppets are. Avoid.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Warm, charming and funny, just like the Muppets I remember from my childhood. I'm not often one for musicals, but this one - aided by the brilliant combination of fuzzy puppet singers and Flight of the Conchords composition - hits all the right notes. It's funny without nudging into blue territory, a talent that's becoming more scarce by the minute, with a heartwarming reunion storyline that slowly reintroduces the cast and reminds us why we grew to love them in the first place. Loaded with unexpected cameos and sly winks at the troupe's long history, it's clear that a lot of love went into the making of this picture; the screen positively resonates from beginning to end. Though I was hesitant to revisit this old territory at first, by the final act I was grinning warmly and nodding right along, utterly entranced.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A heartfelt and hilarious tribute to The Muppets</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was the best Muppet Movie since 1981's The Great Muppet Caper, which is saying a lot, because I hold that film in very high regard.The Muppets have been rather hit and miss since Jim Henson passed away. The Muppet Show was originally started by Henson and Oz as a more adult oriented, yet still family friendly comedy variety show as an outlet for gags and bits that wouldn't work on Sesame Street. It worked too, both kids and adults loved the show, and the first three films are classics in their own right. But, sometime in the 80s, The Muppets started to cater more towards Kids rather than adults. The Muppet Babies were first introduced in the third feature film which eventually spawned its own series. Henson then sold the franchise to Disney and sadly died shortly thereafter. It seems that, after the success of Muppet Babies, Disney decided to continue to move The Muppets in a more kid oriented direction ... one with a decidedly Disney flavor to it. This didn't really help the Muppets legacy in the long term. Kids grow up, and eventually grow out of kid shows and movies. And with very little, if any, appeal to adult audiences, The Muppets were soon forgotten by the generation who grew up in the 90s and 2000s.But the generation that that grew up in the 70s and 80s had not forgotten the old Muppets, in fact they missed them dearly. Jason Segel is one of those people, and it is clear from this film that his enduring love of The Muppets and the influence they had on him as a child, was the driving force behind this movie.This is a comeback movie. The Muppets start off in a bad way. People have forgotten them, their abandoned studio is about to be torn down, and they just aren't popular anymore. This is reflecting the actual situation The Muppets franchise was in at the time they were making the movie. And thus the plot lends itself to fourth wall jokes that were so prevalent in the early films.It is, for the most part, a return to form. This is old school muppet humor at its best. You have the silly and catchy musical numbers, mixed in with a bit of sincere songs, celebrity cameos, fourth wall jokes, pop culture humor, a self aware plot that frequently pokes fun at itself, Fozzie's bad jokes, Statler and Waldorf's heckling, a Kermit and Miss Piggy romance plot, and just general wackiness and slapstick.Still, as similar as it is to the old Muppet formula, it's also quite different. After Disney took over, human characters often played larger roles in the Muppet films. That is the case with this one. In fact, much of the plot and humor in this film is not centered around the muppets at all, but are centered around the two human characters and the new muppet. While some may be disappointed by this change, I have to disagree and say that, for this film, it works and works quite well. Still, it's clear that Disney doesn't have much confidence in The Muppets holding the film together on their own, like they did in the original (and best) Muppet Movie.As a result there are times where the movie feels less like a Muppet Movie and more like a tribute to the Muppets. In some ways this is the film's strength, in other cases it is a weakness. Also, some of the bits in the second half seem a bit awkward and fall flat, often on purpose, but usually it isn't worth the payoff. Nevertheless, this film hits on an emotional and nostalgic level, especially for those who grew up with The Muppets. There were times when I actually felt a tear come to my eye. It's that moving.The film's success so far has been warranted, and I'm hopeful that Disney will do the right thing and green light "The Cheapest Muppet Movie Ever Made", a project Henson and Oz had been pushing for since 1985. There were even plans to make it in 2009, but the project was set aside for this film instead. Hopefully, this last idea by Jim Henson will be the next sequel, the premise certainly looks like it has potential.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"If you're going to see The Muppets you've got to seem them in the theater." "Yeah, you don't want to let 'em into your home!" - Statler and Waldorf.For the last two months of attending films an ad has preceded each movie. Instead of the obligatory "please don't spoil the movie by adding your own soundtrack" narration a cute, lively, spontaneous Muppet skit was shown where Kermit the Frog and Miss Piggy were trying to attend a peaceful movie with the remainder of the Muppet characters making loud and disruptive noises. At the end, the quote above was said by Statler and Waldorf, and it will forever sum up my thoughts on the film.To effectively experience the rambunctious Muppets, you should see their liveliness in the theater. It seems a screen as big as a theater's can't contain their actions. But I'm sure that once The Muppets hits DVD and Blu-Ray many parents will be forced to watch the film again and again on replay. It's a better choice than Diary of a Wimpy Kid or Zookeeper for sure.The Muppets is an extremely self-aware revival to a franchise that will never die. Jason Segal, who also worked on the screenplay of the film, clearly is a super-fan of the movies and the Television series and wanted to give the series a much needed return to the big screen. He doesn't try to parody the formula or rework it in any way, but instead glide along with it in hopes of achieving the best film possible. He doesn't put his usual goofball spin on his character he's done in the past.Set in Smalltown, USA, Gary (Segal) lives with his Muppet-brother Walter (voiced by Peter Linz) and is dating the lovely and adorable Mary (Adams). Walter has grown up with Gary for years, and is one of the biggest Muppet fans of all time (which leads me to believe he is reflecting Segal's personal love for The Muppets). Upon going to The Muppet Theater, Walter overhears Statler, Waldorf, and Tex Richman (Cooper) discussing plans to sell the theater to Tex. But Tex is secretly planning to tear down the theater and drill for oil underneath it.So the only plausible situation in Walter's head is to talk to Kermit the Frog who appears in a glowing light at the nic of time and convince him to reunite the old Muppet crew to put on a Telethon. Then they're off getting back every character in creative and inventive ways.In the time of gimmicky and useless 3D madness leaching onto every children's films, here is a movie that doesn't believe it should subject itself to dimming its colors and its actions just to garner in a higher revenue. The Muppets are such an eclectic and effervescent bunch that the 2D world can handle them perfectly fine.There are a few things that I noticed here and there. The main one is definitely the voices. If you're a Muppet fan, you may be disappointed to notice that voices like Kermit the Frog aren't on par with the voices from the series and the previous films. Still, it doesn't take long before you forget that fact. Also, the lack of cameos astounds me. There are quite a few, but the ones "edited for time constraints" like Danny Trejo, Mila Kunis, Ricky Gervais, George Clooney, Lady Gaga sounded fun and enlightening, but also limitless in possibilities. Of course we do get pleasant cameos like Zach Galifianakis, Jack Black, and Alan Arkin, but it feels like that for once the cameo portion wasn't focused on a lot like in previous Muppet films.I also have to say I was a little disappointed that popular Muppet characters like Miss Piggy and Kermit the Frog, after all these years, still gets brought to the foreground leaving many secondary characters in search of a time to shine. One character that needed a musical number was the Swedish Chef, personally one of my favorite Muppets next to Statler and Waldorf. The Chef needed at least one musical number, but the film just incorporates him very vaguely and rarely. Along with other Muppet characters like Gonzo and Fozzie Bear.There is still plenty here for amusement, and The Muppet character never cease to put a smile on your face whether you're old or young. Although targeted to families, I'm not sure many kids would "get" the references, but immediately dive into the bright colors in this unique world. I don't think the film really cares if you get the joke or not. I think the idea is just happy to be back on the screen one more time.Starring: Jason Segal, Amy Adams, Jack Black, Zach Galifianakis, and Alan Arkin. Directed by: James Bobin.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In Disney's major release for the holiday season, they went with an old stand by, the Muppets, in a film simply called The Muppets. It's a strange blend of humor, nostalgia, and satire. Here we meet Walter, who we know just by looking at him is a little bit different. He is, well, for lack of a better word, a Muppet. The only thing is he is a Muppet living in the real world, and not, I stress not, a member of the Muppet gang. At a very young age he fell under their spell, through television and video rentals. Walter's dream was to walk through the studio that his beloved Muppet's walked through. He gets his chance to meet them when his brother Gary (Jason Segel, who also co-wrote the script) takes his girlfriend Mary (Amy Adams) to Los Angeles.Walter finds out that the Muppets aren't as popular as they used to be. He finds only remnants of the glory days in a dusty studio, but winds up uncovering a sinister plot intending to bury the Muppet franchise for good. With so much at stake, Walter goes to great lengths to find his idols and bring them back together. With the help of Gary, Amy, Kermit, Fozzie, and the rest of the gang, Walter sets in motion a reunion scenario where if the Muppets put on one last show they can raise enough money to stop the maniacal Tex Richman (Chris Cooper) from ending the Muppet's hopes of survival.It's almost like The Blues Brothers, where if "the band" gets back together all will be saved. The only difference is that for the audience it's like a reunion, too. We haven't seen the Muppets together save for a few commercials and music videos here and there. I would be lying if I said I didn't get goosebumps seeing Gonzo with his chickens, or the Swedish Chef and his man-hands. Without even trying this film grabs you right in the heart, squeezing every ounce of childhood you have left in there.It is really evident that Segel took the task of acting and, more importantly, writing, very seriously. His heart really comes through. He didn't want to do an injustice to the franchise that gave him so much pleasure as a youngster. It's as if he wrote Walter as a Muppetization of himself (which really comes through during one particular musical number). He follows the Muppet formula of combining cultural references with the power of celebrity and the importance of silliness and childlike inhibition.Has any of the magic left the Muppets? I don't think so. I must admit that some of the story points were a bit ridiculous, and sometimes a little too on the nose (yes, I am aware that it was trying to be, but doing it too much becomes tedious). I wasn't entering the film expecting completely revamped Muppet style. It was by the book, aimed appropriately at both children and adults, without ever stepping too far in either direction.The BIG question remains...now what? The whole point of the movie is to show that the Muppet's have basically become an afterthought. A fond memory that quickly fades. Will this film attract a slew of Muppet followers? Will there be another film? Television show? Who knows. The movie ends optimistically, but how could it not? The thought of a world without the Muppets is scary. It's nice knowing that somewhere Kermit and the gang are waiting for their next queue. To light the lights, put on make up, and all that jazz.So go treat yourself to a little taste of your childhood. It will do the soul good.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm old enough that I never saw Kermit until I was 12 and was watching Sesame Street with my youngest brother in 1969. Loved The Muppet Show in the late '70s, and was reintroduced to Sesame Street with my daughter in the early '80s.My husband and I were about the only adults without children in this afternoon's showing of The Muppet Movie. We loved almost every minute if it.Like "Up," the first 10 minutes or so of this movie are both brilliant and touching. Any kid who felt at all like an outsider in childhood, and saw "his/her people" in another part of popular culture can relate to Walter.There are loads of pop culture (especially about the '80s) and movie-making jokes throughout the movie. Teens and adults will probably appreciate them more than the kids did. The '80s Robot was a great concept!The movie lags a little here and there - it steals a bit much from the "Blues Brothers" and "UHF" and the original "Muppet Movie." There was a little much toilet humor and vaudeville jokes were just too obscure for 2011.However...One thing I found especially interesting was what was amusing to the kids in the audience. The kids really didn't seem to like the singing (though I found the Chris Cooper rap a complete hoot). The funniest thing to the kids seemed to be the abrupt appearance of Jim Parsons near the end of the movie. "It's Sheldon!" even some very young kids were saying. But the kids got wicked antsy during Kermit's overly-long speech at the end.On the whole, it's a cute, entertaining flick. Jason Segel and Amy Adams were both charming. But the movie was funnier when it was more subversive.</fullReview>

A good portion of the film was centered on a Muppet Telethon with a bunch of very short guest cameos (mostly Disney franchise stars) and rehashing of old bits from the original TV show.It's very telling that Frank Oz disliked the script Jason Segel wrote and refused to take part in production. I would love to read the Frank Oz script. I bet Disney rejected it because it would've cost more to produce.</fullReview>

It takes far too long to get them all together again, and when they are found, it speeds over all the back-story to focus on the humans again! I understand that they needed to re- establish the gang for a new audience, but it's like taking the legacy apart, and putting it back together again, only not very well...A lot of the humour seemed juvenile and simplistic, not with the subversive, satirical edge that "The Muppet Show" mastered... You were watching adult material presented in a package that kids could also enjoy... Now, with the update, it felt more like it was pitched directly at kid-level...I have similar reservations to those of Frank Oz... and if Frank Oz declines to be involved, then you know there's something amiss!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The triumphant return of the Muppets to the silver screen after over a decade</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The late Jim Henson's lovable Muppets have now been around for decades, entertaining people of all ages. I'm definitely far from the only one who can say that the world-famous puppet characters were a major part of my childhood, and I haven't been disappointed revisiting them after growing up. I didn't see this 2011 movie, simply titled "The Muppets", when it came into theatres late last year, but since I had seen all the previous theatrical Muppet movies, I was bound to see this one after it came into stores, hoping it would be a LOT better than 1999's "Muppets from Space", the only theatrical movie in the franchise that didn't impress me at all! Well, I've seen it twice this week, and can say I definitely got what I hoped for! Walter, a puppet, has always been very close to his human brother, Gary. At an early age, the two of them discovered the Muppets and quickly became a devout fans. Years later, the now grown up brothers still live together, and Gary has been dating a woman named Mary for the past ten years. The human brother plans to take his girlfriend to Los Angeles for their tenth anniversary, and is taking his puppet brother along with him for a tour of the abandoned Muppet Studios, though Mary doesn't like Gary always bringing Walter along with them wherever they go. During the tour of the Muppet Studios, Walter sneaks into Kermit the Frog's old office, where he witnesses Statler and Waldorf selling the Muppet Theatre to businessman Tex Richman, and after the two leave the room, Walter overhears Richman's intentions to destroy the building and drill for oil underneath! The devout Muppets fan tells Gary and Mary about what he has just heard, and the three of them must try and reunite the Muppets so the old team can raise $10 million and save their theatre!This 2011 blockbuster begins fairly well, showing Walter and Gary growing up together and their relationship. After this sequence, it shows them grown up and about to go on their trip to Los Angeles. This part features the first song in the movie, "Life's a Happy Song", and while this may not be "Rainbow Connection", it's still a good and catchy tune to start off with. Other standout songs follow, such as "Man or Muppet". The gags in the film may not usually be hilarious (though there are some hilarious moments, such as how long Walter screams after he hears Richman's intentions), but there are plenty of amusing moments, obviously largely thanks to the famous Muppets with their charm and antics. I guess they're not exactly the main characters here, which some fans have a problem with, but they still get PLENTY of screen time and are still thoroughly entertaining. Jack Black can also provide some laughs as himself here, even if this is not the funniest he's ever been. "The Muppets" doesn't rely entirely on its gags, as I found the plot consistently entertaining, and there are some poignant moments. Jason Segel and Amy Adams are both impressive as the human leads, and Chris Cooper is also convincing as the antagonist. Walter, a new Muppet introduced in this movie, is a lovable one, much like Henson's famous Muppets.I've noticed a lot of negative reviews here, and I'm sure some fans of the Muppets gang have good reasons to dislike this movie, but I'm afraid I can't say I agree with any of them. The only theatrical Muppets movie I've ever been able to write a negative review for was the last one before this, which I found to be not only not very funny, but so too dreary and cruel for the Muppets. I felt like the Muppets I knew as a kid had gone so far away when I watched "Muppets from Space" several years ago, but that was certainly NOT how I felt when I watched this latest theatrical movie featuring Jim Henson's characters. I'm sure many people haven't been impressed with anything that has been done with the Muppets since Jim Henson's premature death in 1990, and for them, I guess there's no point in watching this, but if you're not one of those, and you want a good, lighthearted family film, I think this is a really good one to check out for the family. Yes, it is rated PG, but I've definitely seen far raunchier PG-rated films marketed in the "family" category, such as the unsatisfactory "Cheaper by the Dozen" remake.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I must admit, I usually write reviews when i am angry, however in this case, I am writing this review because of pure love for the movie.I went to this movie expecting few laughs and an enjoyable night. My expectations were met and more. the songs were great, the plot was classic Hollywood plot but they made fun of it so it didn't bother me at all. I laughed at all the jokes without exception. I didn't know the whole cast so the surprise appearances affected me emotionally. most importantly, I felt that the people who are doing that movie didn't acted on that movie for the money, for the box office or for the fame, they did it for pure love for the Muppet's(most of them anyways) and I felt that. I was asking my self why I loved this movie? and this is was the answer I got. As long as these kinds of movies being made, there is still hope for Hollywood.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Walter is a Muppet whose ambition is to visit the Muppet theatre in Hollywood.One day, he gets the opportunity to go, with his brother, Gary and his girlfriend, Mary. However, when they arrive they are saddened by the state that the theatre has got into.When Walter discovers that oil magnate Tex Richman intends to buy the theatre to drill for oil, he, Gary and Mary travel far and wide to reunite the disbanded Muppet's.Together again, the Muppet's must put on a show and try to keep their theatre....For a big comeback movie, the Muppet's have gone for the most simple of stories. Evil corporation turning a beloved place into something else. The Muppet's only have a certain amount of time to claim it back.It's simple stuff, but the way this film is executed is something awe-inspiring. It's clear that Segel is a huge fan of the Muppets, as there is much love and attention given to secondary Muppet's as much as the regulars.It was a huge risk to start a 35 year old franchise from scratch and introduce it to a new demographic. After all, the last movie was criminally bad.The songs are good, and just offer the right amount of cheese, rather than going all out soppy. The performances are great and a lot of the cameos are a funny inclusion, but did Jack Black have to be so annoying.All in all, it's a massive feat t make something so old, feel so fresh and up to date, and also make a film thats funny for the whole family.Brilliant, feel good stuff.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Do the muppets owe taxes and need another movie because of this?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's bad enough when you watch human actors doing a movie or a sequel that is obviously being done out of an ulterior motive, but with a bunch of F-in muppets?!?! Does the Henson estate owe taxes or are they losing their property? (which is the ridiculous premise of this movie) I really thought Segel would have done something special with this because of all of the attention given to his interests in this field and the fact that he put together a muppet-type play of his own. No! And!, he had someone help him with it as well (Stoller). I was even in a good mood when I rented it, expecting a new revitalized movie from a zealot in this field of entertainment. A random pick out of a lottery ball of kids' scripts would have been better than this, and because of this, my interest in Segel went far down. Cameos and "you sing it, audience!" are sure signs that the artist isn't secure with what is being performed and there are so many cameos that it even outshines the completely apathetic humor. Statler and Waldorf couldn't even trash this movie properly, and it's too bad because all of the resources were there.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How to run down the Muppet franchise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just watched this on a flight to Australia, so plenty of time to think over things, but basically what was the point of making this movie? I could understand the Gary character as a big Muppet fan and getting to finally see the old studios, but the brother Walter did NOT fit and girlfriend was really quite strange (fixing a 12v starter in the classroom?). Why don't they just admit Walter is a puppet rather than try to treat him like a human, or am I missing some sort fantasy angle on the whole thing? Or am I not PC enough? It seems to me that the use of all the old characters (I must admit very well done) was really rather wasted when the whole thing had very little plot. At least the celebrity they got was a good choice!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Back to my childhood for a lot of laughs</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I was a kid The Muppet Show was not to be missed in our house on Sunday night. It was half an hour of anarchic humour, a lot of which I didn't get. However I did admire the weekly guest stars, volunteering to be humiliated by Jim Henson's gang.This movie is for people of my generation, who can remember the original series. I'm not sure how familiar kids under the age of about fifteen will be with the main Muppet characters. The movie unashamedly comes to the conclusion that things were better in the old days and nothing is as funny as The Muppets. I suspect that Jason Segel, who wrote this movie, is of the same opinion.The story is about a young Muppet living with his brother (who isn't a Muppet!) in small town America. On a trip to LA they discover that the Muppets Show team have long gone their separate ways and the theatre is about to be demolished by an oil baron.The only solution, of course, is to reunite the old team for a fund raising concert. The fun begins here and we see what has become of Kermit, Fozzy and Miss Piggy and the rest of the gang. There are some great scenes and lines, most of which are aimed at the older viewer rather than kids. There are also some cameos from Jack Black and Sarah Silverman among others.I'm giving anything away by saying that it all turns out well in the end. My only quibble that there are perhaps too many songs in the movie but that is just personal taste.All in all, this movie is a great laugh for people of my generation.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Muppets</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The last time we saw fuzzy puppet characters on the big screen was twelve years before this, when Gonzo found out his true origins, all that followed after that were television made specials and films, so it was wonderful to see that Disney were bringing us a brand new movie. Basically Walter (Peter Linz) is a puppet who lives with his human brother Gary (Forgetting Sarah Marshall's Jason Segel, also writing) in Smalltown, they watched The Muppet Show ever since they were young, and their love for them still continues as they have grown up. Gary is planning a vacation to Los Angeles, this is also a celebration of Gary's tenth anniversary with his girlfriend Mary (Amy Adams), she sometimes feels her boyfriend devotes more of his time to his brother than on their relationship. In L.A. the Muppet Theatre has become derelict, with a dull tour, so Walter sneaks into the old office of his idol, Kermit the Frog (Steve Whitmire), and he overhears Statler (Whitmire) and Waldorf (Dave Goelz) talking to oil magnate Tex Richman (Chris Cooper). They say that the Muppets can buy back the Theatre and studio if they can raise $10,000,000, but when they leave the room Richman and his cohorts Bobo the Bear (Bill Barretta) and Uncle Deadly (Matt Vogel) reveal their true intentions, to destroy the Muppet Theatre to drill for oil. With this knowledge, Walter, Gary and Mary go to Kermit's mansion to convince him that the Muppets need to reunite for a special television telethon to raise the money to save the Theatre, and even though Kermit is unsure due to so many years passing Walter says he should try. So they start the journey to get the rest of the gang back, wherever they are and whatever career or profession they are in now, and one by one they do eventually agree. Fozzie Bear (Eric Jacobson) was in a Muppet tribute band called The Moopets with a group of unconvincing impersonators, Gonzo the Great (Dave Goelz) had become a plumbing magnate with his own factory, and Animal (Jacobson) was in an anger management clinic, along with actor Jack Black, learning to resist his urge for drumming. In a montage the rest of the Muppets rejoin as well, with the Electric Mayhem - Dr. Teeth (Barretta), Sgt. Floyd Pepper (Vogel), Zoot (Goelz), Janice (David Rudman) and Scooter (Scooter), Dr. Bunsen Honeydew (Goelz) and his assistant Beaker (Whitmire), and Rowlf the dog (Barretta). Of course the last of the Muppets to be found is Miss Piggy (Jacobson), who in Pris, France working for Vogue as editor for plus-sized fashion, but her pride and remaining and feelings for Kermit forces her to refuse, so they are forced to replace her with an unconvincing impersonator, Miss Poogy (Rudman). The Muppets pitch their reunion telethon to several television networks, who all turn them down, and it is only after the sudden cancellation of a popular show the CDE network executive and Muppet fan Veronica Martin (Rashida Jones) gives them a two hour slot. The only condition is that they must find a celebrity guest, so while they try and find one they get started on repairing the old Muppet Theatre and rehearsing for the show. Soon enough Miss Piggy returns, forcing the mean Miss Poogy out, and Kermit asks Walter to perform on the broadcast night, but he has not found his talent, and meanwhile Gary realises that he has been neglecting Mary, after she is angry sight seeing alone, and he also forgot about their anniversary. They manage to get Jack Black on board, after kidnapping him, and the telethon gets underway, initially with no Theatre audience, but this does build, and telephone calls pledging thousands of dollars are flooding in, and Walter eventually feels brave to perform his talent, operatic whistling. Richman does try to ruin the telethon by turning off the power and stopping the money coming in, but it turns out that the pledge to raise $10,000,000 fails before the midnight deadline, they only raise $99,999.99. Kermit and the rest of the gang are forced to leave, and when they open the doors the streets are crowded with thousands of Muppet fans, and in the end they get the Theatre after Richman gets Gonzo's bowling ball on the head, Gary and Mary get engaged, Kermit and Miss Piggy reunite, and Walter joins the Muppets as one of them. Also starring Steve Whitmire as Rizzo, Link Hogthrob and The Newsman, Eric Jacobson as Sam Eagle, Dave Goelz as Beauregard, Bill Barretta as Swedish Chef and Pepe the Prawn, Matt Vogel as Camilla the chicken, Sweetums, Lew Zealand and Crazy Harry, Alan Arkin as Tour Guide, Bill Cobbs as Grandfather, Zach Galifianakis as Hobo Joe, The Hangover's Ken Jeong as 'Punch Teacher' Host, Jim Parsons as Human Walter, Sarah Silverman as Greeter, The Adjustment Bureau's Emily Blunt as Miss Piggy's Receptionist, Whoopi Goldberg, Selena Gomez, Foo Fighters' David Grohl as Animool, Neil Patrick Harris, Judd Hirsch, Mickey Rooney as Smalltown Resident and Jerry Nelson as Telethon Announcer. Segel is likable, Adams is adorable, Cooper is amusing as the nasty villain, new puppet character Walter is sweet, and of course Kermit, Miss Piggy, Gonzo, Fozzie, Animal and the rest of the Muppets are all the stars who still put a smile on your face. If you are a Muppet fan from their early beginnings, or even if were introduced them later in life, they are still as wonderful as before, and accompanied by great new songs and many celebrity cameos that you can spot, this is terrific viewing for both kids and adults combined, a fantastically fun family musical comedy. It won the Oscar for Best Song for "Man or Muppet". The Muppets were number 47 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons. Very good!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So like other people who like the Muppets, I was happy to see this movie at first. However, this movie was butchered by Disney. The new character (Walter) is pretty generic and not really that funny. Jason Segal and Amy Adams are way too campy and one of the things I always liked about Muppets is that it was funny, childish, but didn't insult your intelligence. Amy Adams can't sing, Jason Segal isn't really that funny and the Muppets kinda take a backseat to the main characters plot. There were a few parts that did make me laugh and those were parts that were what makes the Muppets so great. So to sum it up: This movie is campy, boring at parts, funny at some parts, you're gonna hate the singing parts (unless it's the Muppets) and Disney embarrassed a really great name.</fullReview>

Jason Segel had his heart in the right place when he took on this movie.There are about 10 scenes that make it totally worth the ticket price:(Chickens, Rainbow Connection, the rap song by Chris Cooper). The "man or a Muppet" song was unexpectedly cute! A couple of scenes made me want to hurl. (dance sequence at the beginning, make-up scene towards the end). Fans of the series will be happy with the movie, I think.I saw it with my 12-year-old, and he is now a fan. In fact, we've been singing all of the pop songs on the radio in chicken.

		<shortDescription>"The Muppets" is one of the most gleefully smashing movies of 2011</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Muppets" is one of the most gleefully smashing movies of 2011. It's one of those pictures that is not only charming and clever, but does not smugly rub its accolades into the faces of the audience, so that they may just sit back and enjoy the show. Watching the picture with an auditorium full of persons from all ages and joining in with the unanimous laughter and cheers and shameless ear-to-ear grins was one of the great experiences that I have had in a movie theater. It's like one of those classic Broadway shows where even though you've seen it a dozen times and have a general idea of what to expect, you get never tired of. I personally loathe the idea of the Muppets ever disappearing from the screen. But never fear, this movie is proof that is not about to happen any time soon.This movie starts not with any of the old gang, but instead a brand new sock-puppet character by the name of Walter (voice of Peter Linz) who looks sort of like a tan, tuxedoed Kermit the Frog with a tuft of hair on his head. He's the brother (adopted?) of a human (Jason Segel), who is also his best friend, but has always longed to be one of the Muppets who have sort of fallen out of their pinnacle, as they have in real life, until now. And just like until now, their fame is foundering until Walter and his brother and his brother's fiance (Amy Adams) journey to Hollywood. There, they not only bump into Good Ol' Kermit the Frog, but discover that an evil oil tycoon (a perfectly-cast Chris Cooper) is planning on demolishing the Muppets' old studio. The only thing that can stop him, as Statler and Waldorf point out in a comically on-camera acknowledgment of a plot point, is if the Muppets can raise ten million dollars. And the only way they can do that is come back together again and put on a big show.The first half of the movie spends the appropriate amount of time collecting all of our beloved characters. The movie devotes enough space to each and every one of the primary characters so that they don't feel like just points pushing the plot further along. The second half of the movie is where it really, really gets good. It is completely devoted to the revival of the Muppet show, in which they try new tactics and also reuse the familiar but never tiring gags that they have done for decades. Here the movie really scores strongly by diving right into the hearts of the audience. Just watching the performances by the Muppets was soul-lifting; it was like being a kid once again, watching early-morning shows on the weekend or before school, as I did a lot growing up. Simultaneously, the movie works with a 'struggle for success' kind of suspense plot and frankly, waiting to see if the Muppets will succeed or fail in saving their studio (and the results may surprise you!) is much more intense than seeing which side of Michael Bay's frighteningly personality-devoid robot-armies will triumph over the other, or whether at least one empty-headed college kid will survive getting gobbled up by a shark. I really do not want to give away the ending, but I will say this much. It reminded me a lot of the ending of the underrated classic "A Boy Named Charlie Brown" which also found just the right note about the difference between success, failure, and the importance of never giving up.What also makes "The Muppets" such a great movie-going time is the way it kids around with itself, with the characters acknowledging plot points and mentioning the budget of the movie. Furthermore, it makes great moments in drawing in celebrities such as Whoopie Goldberg, Selena Gomez, Alan Arkin, and Jack Black (who steals all of these cameos in some of the most hilarious moments of his up-and-down career) for appearances that are not mere throw-aways. Cap onto that some wonderfully ear-worm musical pieces. Three of the classic Muppets songs are reused; the rest are brand-new. The opening number is particularly good, reminding me of the musical-comedies of Hollywood's golden era. The best and most funny of them being when Walter and Gary are duo-singing "Man or Muppet" along with reflections in the mirror. The gag is that the reflection is a character who is the opposite of what they are.What do I mean, exactly? Well, rather than give it away, I'll let you go see the movie.It is a wonderful thing to be surprised by movies, but it is even more glorious to go in with high expectations to have them all met to the hilt. "The Muppets" is one of those movies. Hollywood has made countless revivals, spin-offs, and remakes in recent years and some of them have felt absolutely unnecessary and tiring, but not this movie. This is a revival that deserves to go on and on. And it is so clever and smart and charming with the way it handles itself that it deserves to be seen by people of all ages, regardless of how much or little they know about the Muppets or their creator, the late Jim Henson. But whether you are a longtime devotee or newcomer, this new "The Muppets" will leave you hungry for more. There is also a key moment midway through the movie, when a TV producer is describing to the Muppets their on-air competition: the violence and pseudo-hip garbage that children have been flooded with. And in the end, the scene proves to be a commentary on an element of American culture today and reminds kids and parents that something like this is more pure and important in a child's life than what they usually find on the television today. And there is still magic to be found at the movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best argument I can think of for NOT making a sequel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dull, ponderous, packed with clichs, entirely lacking the creativeness , inventiveness, zaniness and general humanity with which Henson and his original team imbued the whole Muppet story. Instead, under the dead hand of Disney, we get yet another "road/let's put on a show/anyone can be anything at all they want if they really, really try!" piece of processed movie-making which does nothing at all to salute the unique creativity of Henson and co. After about half an hour, I found the only bits I was enjoying were the appearances by Amy Adams, whom the camera likes and who has real star quality as well as being a very good singer and dancer (classically trained, I suspect?) (Her male counterpart, Jason Segal, lacked all of these qualities and came across, like the movie as a whole, as wooden and lifeless). NOT the tribute to Henson I wanted to see and I can only hope that, out of respect for his spirit, this now really is the end of attempts to revive the Muppets and people go back to the VHS recordings of the originals instead.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I was a kid The Muppets was a really great show. It was funny,over the top and it featured so many celebrates from Sandra Bullock,Julie Andrews the list goes on. After that The Muppets had some TV movies out and that was it. So in 2011 Disney decided to do ANOTHER Muppets flick starring Jason Segal and Amy Adams.So what is it aboutWell Gary(played by Jason Segal) has a brother named Walter(who is a puppet btw which is kinda weird having a puppet as your brother)who is a hardcore fan of The Muppets. So Walter,Gary and Gary's girlfriend Mary(played by Giselle from Enchanted Amy Adams)travel to Los Angelus to track down the Muppets and for Gary and Mary to celebrate their 10 year anniversary as boyfriend and girlfriend.But an evil Oil Tycoon(played by Gary Cooper from Sea biscuit) wants to make the Muppets live terribly because he wants to get rid of the Muppets.So after this set up you think its the best movie of all time and should be No 5 in my list right,well there are some problems and I know I might get a drilling for saying it but its the songs. I hated the songs in this movie. There was too many songs and the only song I liked was I'm A Muppet Or A Man which was really good yet sad at the same time cause Walter wanted to be a someone and Gary singing about life as a puppet. Also that song that Amy Adams sings MAN was she so annoying in this movie. YES I liked her in Enchanted but here she was so annoying even her singing wasn't as good as the songs in Enchanted. Also I hated the rapping Chris Cooper song OH MY GOD I just wanted to skip that part it was like the rapping dog in that cartoon Titanic movie(do not watch that movie btw it sucks big time)The set up was a bit disappointing because we don't get to see the Muppets have their adventure heck they might as well call it The Jason Segal and Muppet Movie with Amy Adams while there at it.But having said that its a good flick but its not as good as the other Disney movies out there and I think its the most overrated new Disney movie ever. Like it got 96% in Rotten Tomatoes seriously!?!Overall its a 6 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More or less what you'd expect from the Hollywood machine. Entertaining nevertheless.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Since I only remember seeing their Treasure Island film when I was very young, The Muppets was exactly what I expected. A light family affair with a mix of cheap and satirical jokes that runs as fast as it can for that feel-good feel. The story is pretty predictable beat-by-beat, like a very rushed The Blues Brothers archetype, which means it's devoid of tension and identifiability even though it tries. It's a film best for the gimmicks. There's some genuinely laugh-out-loud moments with it's self-conscious jokes about films, such as "travelling by the map" and Gonzo's "self-destruct entire plumbing factory" button, especially the awareness of singing songs. However the self-conscious jokes about celebrities really didn't work and seemed smug. Also felt smug for how it tried to put words in the audience's mouths with "everyone loves the muppets" being a constant theme throughout.Nevertheless, the songs are absolute genius - in particular "Man or a Muppet" which absolutely deserved it's Oscar, and "Life Is A Happy Song" is irresistibly toe tappingly contagious. Definitely the obvious highlight of the film. The main problem, I felt, was that the villain (played by Chris Cooper) really didn't work. They tried to make him intentionally clichd but it ended up incredibly half-hearted and unnecessary - the spontaneous rap song is the final nail in the coffin for hope of a decent antagonist. It's still fantastic seeing all these TV stars together in a big feature film, I gasped manically when I saw Ken Jeong and then Don Glover. A very undemanding, entertaining and quite rewarding movie, exactly what you expect from the Hollywood machine today.6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was completely expecting to really enjoy this movie. The Muppets are awesome and funny, Jason Segel was in Forgetting Sarah Marshall which was very funny and Amy Adams is a cool, young actress. But the style of comedy in this movie was awful IMO. Obviously the plot and acting in this kind of movie are mediocre but that doesn't matter as long as it's entertaining and/or hilarious. But it's neither.I have a feeling some of this is to do with the new people doing the Muppet characters. They might be able to do the voices close enough, but that's not what counts. I listened to an episode of the Nerdist podcast where the Muppets were the guest. It was dull. Who wants to hear someone do accurate imitations of the voices of the characters when they have no sense of humour or comic timing. This isn't the Muppets, it's a pale, cheap imitation.The original people obviously had something else in them, whatever you want to call it. It brought the Muppets alive so that everyone would always say they would speak directly to the Muppet forgetting that it was being puppeted. Here they're all dead. I'm only an hour in and I'm feeling sick because of how easy the jokes are to anticipate and how badly executed they are. It's awkward. I'm physically getting worked up because of how bad it is. You might call it annoying comedy. It wants to annoy you and make you groan. Of course, those aren't good things.This movie hinges too much on how cool the Muppets inherently are, which they are. But not here. You still have to earn things. And looking and sounding like the Muppets isn't enough. Referencing old things and having cameos isn't enough. You have to have ideas in your own right. It's not surprising Frank Oz didn't want to be involved. For me this is a massive disappointment and a disturbingly bad film!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The intentions were good...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a movie, this was not too bad. But as a Muppet movie, it leaves much to be desired. I wanted to like this movie very much, and in the end there were plenty of the right ingredients: songs, a simple and sometimes silly plot, jokes that break the fourth wall, cameos, and heartfelt moments. However, I felt that the movie tried way too hard to gain my sympathy by making me believe that the Muppets had been "forgotten" and their time had come and gone. Ridiculous! It is almost insulting to the legacy of Jim Henson to suggest such a thing. The Muppets aren't THAT old, and the truth is they have not come out with a decent movie for a while. (I thought Muppets Wizard of Oz was atrocious!)I kept asking myself why the film thought it was necessary to keep reminding the audience about how "great" the Muppets were to begin with. I would preferred if we were just shown how funny and lovable they were instead of bogging us down with all the drama. Don't get me wrong, there are some good jokes, but the heart of the movie relies too much on the nostalgia factor. As for the songs, they were OK, but not as Muppet-y as I would have hoped. "Life's a Happy Song" was nice, but could easily have fit into any number of campy Disney movies. "Pictures in My Head" was touching, but it was almost like the Muppets were BEGGING for my love and admiration. By the time "Rainbow Connection" played in the movie, I was tired of this kind of begging.When you remove the nostalgia factor, I think you're left with a fun but bland representation of the Muppets. It's kind of like the title of the movie, "The Muppets", which is rather uninspired. On a positive note, I'm very glad the creators did not take it in a bad direction by trying to modernize the Muppets. They could have made Fozzie rap and made Gonzo breakdance with a bunch of chickens! It's obvious the film meant well, and it is decent entertainment for the family, but I recommend The Muppet Movie, The Great Muppet Caper, and A Muppet Christmas Carol over this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I expected so much more</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have been a fan of the Muppets since I was a child and I greatly anticipated this film having trusted Jason Segel completely. I'm sad to say he has disappointed me a little bit.The film IS funny, just not REALLY funny as other Muppet films were. The script was pretty good, it was a good idea using the well-known plot of 'getting the band back together because a big bad company wants to knock the studio down', because it means a new generation of potential Muppet fans can be introduced to this. The humour from the Muppets themselves is great and can be really funny and even satirical at some points, meaning both adults and kids can laugh.The major weak part of this film was the songs, some were just awful, very few were funny apart from a few lines overall. The dance routines were also pretty poor; I expected a lot more for a Muppet film.The real life actors were probably what let this film down overall, from the main characters to the supposed famous cameo roles. Half of the cameos were all just Segel's friends which is fine but some real A-Listers would have been greatly appreciated.Overall, the film was good and was really funny but too much let it down which means it left me a bit disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The new muppets movie is not worth it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie on the airplane to America. I was enthousiastic at first cause I love the Muppets concept. But I got SO DISAPPOINTED that I turned it off halfway through the movie.I grew up with the Muppets and really love the warm and tender movies they used to represent. Muppets Christmas Carol, Muppets Treasure Island etc. Old familiar stories wrapped in a puppet chaotic frenzy of fast jokes, lovely, deep, funny characters and the all familiar Muppets magic in overall. There was always laughter and pleasantness served tenfold. A feel-good feeling that lasts a few days. Sadly, I have to admit that all that magic WAS the fabulous Jim Henson and Frank Oz. Ever since they stopped doing it, the Muppets magic died for me. I tried to punch through it in this movie, but it just doesn't work. It's just.........Muppets was Jim Henson and Frank Oz. And this movie has just not been made with the same fire, the same love as the old ones. Even tho they used a few of the old folks back then. The cream top of this cake goes to the very thin script. Muppets used to have story. Feeling. I remember sitting on the couch with my girlfriend, on rainy afternoons under a blanket with hot coco, watching a Muppet movie, and you would feel great and dandy. This storyline was so thin it just didn't grab your attention at all. No magic, no script.........no interest. As a cherry on top of that cake, the o so very annoying fact that the whole movie seemed to be more about who's Jason Segel and Amy Adams rather than what you expect from a Muppets movie: reviving the Muppets from forgottenness. And tho a few laughters were served, it just lost it's power and originality that way. It's not about the human characters. The Muppets never were. The Muppets used to be about the Muppets. It killed the movie totally. They tried too hard to get that feeling but they just did it wrong. More aiming for the human actors rather than the Muppets (and especially the annoyingness of Jason Segel who thinks he's funny but is such an over-actor). Trying too much to redo the old past in too short a time, again because it was all about Gary and Mary, leaving little time to reflect back on the actual Muppets themselves and deepen out their warm characters again. It makes me say this with pain in my heart. But the Muppets are DEAD! Leave them to good memories. And don't let them get revived by people like Jason Segel. PLEASE DON'T!!!!!!!My conclusion: The movie is a waste of time. If you want to remember the Muppets, remember the old movies. And due to the overacting of Jason Segel, and the simple la</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Muppets are back... well sort of</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I like the Muppets a lot, but on some points this film didn't quite deliver. I enjoyed it, but it wasn't completely the comeback I had hoped for.What I liked about it is that a lot of the muppets that we know from the films and series are in it, as opposed to some of the older films which I seem to remember were mainly Kermit, Fozzie, Gonzo and Ms. Piggy. Too bad though that the collective Muppets have so little screen time in this film, or in any case a lot less than it could ideally have been. There were several moments where I thought "just show me Muppets for crying out loud!" The human companions are a given in any Muppet production, which is fine if they are funny or entertaining to watch, or if they are merely creating the setting for showing us funny Muppet situations, like would so often happen with the many celebrities that visited the Muppet TV-series. Amy Adams is lovely and at times funny, but I have yet to discover the merits of Jason Segel as an actor. He isn't compelling to watch, he really isn't a great actor and he certainly isn't funny. It were especially (but not exclusively) his parts that felt like a drag. If a Muppet, for instance Kermit or in this case Walter, sings a melancholy song it is funny or lovable, but when humans, especially Segal sings it, it just looks kinda ridiculous and besides it feels like it's wasting precious potential Muppet screen time. Even Jack Black's part wasn't seriously funny or properly exploited for the potential Muppet "magic" that I was hoping for.The story itself was fine, not more than that, and anyway it only serves as a vehicle for showing as much Muppet craziness as possible... which I think was pretty meager in this film. They managed to squeeze in a lot of the famous Muppets, and even a few good jokes, but to me it felt like they left open a lot of opportunities to squeeze in even more.All in all I'm happy the Muppets are back, especially if this potentially means we could expect more Muppet films in the future, hopefully even better and funnier than this one. I enjoyed this film, but it certainly wasn't great. It's the first Muppet film in years, but that fact alone really isn't enough to earn it more than a 6 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The muppet's charming looks (even with their legs extremely visible) and a few trademark acts make up for a regrettable and senseless plot and awkward human characters whose acting seems inappropriate for the movie itself: other than the ridiculously funny cameo of Jack Black, all the other celebrities seem out of place (Jason Segal) or wasted oportunities (like Selena Gomez or Neil-Patrick Harris). The movie's main character isn't all that bad, but kind of a clich underdog who's a fan of a dying trend, the crisis involving the muppets and human characters are solved in ridiculous or senseless ways and some of the characters are even forgotten along the way. Music acts are necessary, but many of them, mostly the ones not involving the muppets themselves, are quite poor. Also, I can't really sympathize with the muppets when they simply reject a member of the group to begin with, either. The ending (but fortunately not the credits sequence) is quite disappointing, to.On the other hand, however, Kermit is a well-done character and the movie DOES have some funny and heartbreaking moments, mostly during the second part of the movie, but I wish they'd focused more on the small acts that made The Muppets so special to begin with...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Before the release of this movie the last time the Muppets had a theatrical release was way back in 1998 with Muppets From Space. Since then they have mostly stagnated with straight-to-DVD and TV movies. Someone at Disney reckoned a reboot was in order so now we have the unimaginatively-titled "The Muppets". I was surprised to see Jason Segal's name as a writer in the opening credits, and I had hopes that it would feel original and inspired rather than something made by a Disney committee.With the gang disbanded and pursuing their own paths their theatre is at risk of falling into the hands of a greedy oil magnate. A young misfit Muppet decides to get them together and save their legacy. Sound familiar? It's virtually the exact same plot from It's a Very Merry Muppet Christmas Movie, by way of many repeated scenes from the original Muppet Movie. I have to say I wasn't smitten, despite really wanting to like it. The human interaction with the mop-puppets didn't seem natural (you know what I mean) and felt stilted and difficult. They're just in the background with no decent story.There were too many songs, a couple being completely superfluous. Despite the numerous cameos I just didn't feel that this movie had any star power. I longed for Michael Caine to show up and add some credibility to it. Sadly it was just too TV-ish, with many TV actors filling out the various parts. This ranks somewhere towards the bottom of the Muppets long list of movies, even beneath The Muppets Go Medieval starring Troy McClure.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Now, I love the Muppets, as my username clearly implies, and was hyped when I heard there was going to be a new theatrical release two years ago. All I can say is that I'm glad I waited until I could see it on HBO to finally see it.Now, as a movie, it's not horrible. But my problem with it is that it doesn't feel like an actual Muppet movie. It seems more like an ascended fanfiction. I guess that was sort of the point, but it's supposed to be a movie first. The songs are forgettable, most of the human actors range from overly cutesy to completely wooden, the story is clich, to say the least, the humor falls flat, and it lacks the general wackiness that makes the Muppets what they are. Several other reviewers have commented on how emotionally manipulative the movie is, and they're all correct. The very premise operates under the assumption that the Muppets are some forgotten entity ("not famous anymore") that no one cares about anymore. The older Muppet films (both those before and after Jim Henson's death) were much more subtle than this. Bottom line, fans, skip this film. Or watch it once. ONCE. Otherwise, go watch any of the three Henson-era films, or Christmas Carol or Treasure Island.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nostalgic, funny and charming enough to cover its weaknesses</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When young Walter is growing up his best friend is his brother Gary. However as the two grow, Gary changes and grows where Walter remains the same size what with him being a felt puppet and all. This difference which went uncommented on as children, now sees Walter as an odd-ball and it is only really his love of the Muppet show that makes him feel at home and comfortable. As a grown man, Gary decides to take Walter with him when he travels from their home in Smalltown to LA ? much to the chagrin of Gary's girlfriend Mary. Once there the goal is to tour the famous Muppet studio, however the reality is that the studio is broken down and abandoned, although sneaking around it allows Walter to overhear a plot by a powerful businessman to tear it down totally and drill for oil. Unwilling to let this happen Walter seeks out Kermit the Frog to raise the money to save the studio.Cleverly this film creates a Muppet character that grew up on the Muppet Show and holds fond memories of it in his heart; this is clever because it is this nostalgia and longing to "put the gang back together again" which drives the film from the base while also layering on the more modern humour that recent outings from them have had. This structure covers a fairly weak and rather obvious plot and allows the focus to be on the throwaway and the witty with plenty of charm to carry you across it. And carry it it does, because as a story the film is fairly simple with an even more simple villain in the middle of it (one that Fox News hilariously got upset about). It gets by though because it is consistently funny and, when you aren't actually laughing at something, it has a warm charm to it that had me smiling anyway.The cast are a big part of this. I'm no fan of Segel or Adams but both are very good here. Their lack of ego and their enjoyment of the film is a bonus and their performances are enjoyable. The Muppet characters are always welcome and i loved what they did with Animal and a few others. The cameos do not distract because they are part of the warm nostalgic charm of the film and as such only add to this feel. Cooper phones it in to a point but he should be very glad of the charm of the whole film because it makes me forgive his rap number, which is hard to watch although it is funny. That it is funny is down to Bret McKenzie (half of Flight of the Conchords) because his songs are wonderfully arch, slight and funny all at once ? loved him as part of that duo and his influence in this film is significant.It is not a perfect film by any means. It could have had more teeth to its comedy and the plotting goes no further than the one line pitch that the executives green-lit; however it is charming and funny and really hard to dislike. I laughed fairly frequently throughout the film and even when I didn't I was still smiling ? sure it is rather coasting on this charm and nostalgia, but when it works why is that a problem?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kermit &amp; the Gang are human puppets having minds of their own.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The nineties were not a kind decade for the Muppets. It began with the death of their creator and mastermind, Jim Henson, followed just two years later by the passing of another gifted principal Muppeteer, Richard Hunt. They returned to the big screen in 1992 with a critical and financial success, the widely frowned-upon "Muppet Christmas Carol", but after that were bombarded with more unfortunate setbacks. While their 1996 venture, "Muppet Treasure Island" did reasonable business, it was met with disappointment by critics and fans. A new television series, "Muppets Tonight" was cancelled after just one half-baked episode. They then came back in 1999 with a new movie, "Muppets from Space", their first original story in over twenty years - which unfortunately met with more unfavorable reviews and bombed in theatres. Finally, Jim Henson company was in financial trouble and acquired by a German entertainment corporation, which was running into money problems itself and left the future of the Muppets in question.The Muppets (2011), therefore, came in the middle of this 30-year semi-slump for the Muppets, and in my opinion, the critics hit the mark on it. It is a somewhat empty, substanceless adventure that attempts to run in the same vein as "Christmas Carol" but fails to carry with it the magic. Once again Gozzo and Mrs. Pig are the real stars here, and that has it's downside. They are great supporting characters, but it's Kermit, Fozzie &amp; Pig that are more suited for the limelight in these kinds of things. Surprisingly, another Frank Oz character, Sam the Eagle, becomes a bigger star than Fozzie and Berry Pepper in this film, but doesn't bring his usual humour to the role. Mrs. Pig scares the bejeezus out of Kermie and gets him to undergo King Solomon's Trials, which are basically pit fights. And another Oz favourite, Gozzo wants to take over the village with his inhuman ideas about science. Animal, is virtually absent, muttering two measly lines in the background of one offscreen scene and is quickly returned to mothballs. Just a note: the Great Muppets Bollywood Extravaganza! is well on its way! Fun cast, new Muppets, all Bollywood. I super can't wait for it to open. Hee!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A hollow mess of a movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Muppets were memorable because they always had good music; in this movie the songwriting was not only bad, but almost embarrassing at times. Some musical numbers are bland pop hits strategically selected from each decade since the 70s to apply to the broadest audience possible. This movie lacks any chemistry between the Muppets and live action characters, who are rarely in the same shot. They achieved this with close-up heavy cinematography, which not only greatly reduced the number of times they'd have to shoot a Muppet and person in the same scene, but lent a claustrophobic feel to the whole movie. Even when Muppets and people are in scenes together, the Muppets looked like they were cheaply green-screened in. There were definitely some funny moments in this movie, but the acting, writing, and execution were too poor to be overcome. Overall, this Muppets movie feels like a half-hearted attempt by The Walt Disney Corporation to reintroduce a brand to a new generation. The Muppets were Jim Henson's art; he's no longer with us, and what's left is a hollow corporate shell.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too many humans..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No greater testament to the singular genius of Jim Henson could be made than to have a company of Disney's stature purchase his once very successful Muppet property and then not be sure how to make it entertaining. The major problem with the film, beyond Henson no longer being around to make it work, is a lack of trust of the source material. Based on the success of the "A Night at the Museum" movies, Amy Adams is brought in to star along Jason Segel as the human protagonists of what worked previously because of a dearth of human characters. Adams and Segel work through a love triangle over top of the relationship problems of Kermit and Ms. Piggy which should have been the romantic "B" plot (the main plot being an effort to save the old Muppet theater. Another major problem is an over-reliance of piercing the fourth wall which is used successful by "The Simpson" and "Simpsons" knockoff shows by Seth MacFarlane largely because they are used sparingly. When nearly every scene includes either a reminder you are watching a movie or a pointless celebrity cameo the trope quickly loses its power to charm. Henson did use the celebrity cameo but he realized the entertainment value was in their suddenly appearing in mundane parts (only the Sarah Silverman cameo is true to the original spirit of the franchise). Henson would have also cleaned up the "2nd draft" feeling of the film particularly easily forgettable song and dance numbers. The most egregious of these is Amy Adams clearly improving her way through a dreadful tune called "Party of One." Suffice to say they won't sell a lot of soundtracks. This not-quite-finished feeling to the songs and script reverberates loudly through the plot which includes the idea that a wealthy oil tycoon plans to demolish the old Muppet theater to drill beneath it...in the middle of Los Angeles (you know the largest city in the most environmentally restrictive U.S. state). Why not make him a wealthy real estate tycoon looking to build condos - that would have made sense. In short, much like "The A-Team", "Dukes of Hazzard", "GI Joe", "Brady Bunch" and other television of the late 70s, 80's and 90's, the muppets don't lend themselves well to resurrection - let it rest in peace.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Muppets aren't so magical here</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love the Muppets, but this film was a major disappointment, I'm actually shocked how they could get it so spectacularly messed up. I mean they have iconic characters that people love, with a tried and tested formula that always guarantees hysterical laughter, yet it seems they've totally abandoned it this time. This didn't feel anything like the Muppets I remember.The knowing wit has been replaced by dumb Hannah Montannah slapstick, the voice delivery of many of the characters lacks comic timing and the right tone to give the gags impact. Miss Piggy, for example, sounds like a bad impersonation of herself.The human characters all act with the sycophantic over-expressiveness of those horribly gleeful children from "Barney The Purple Dinosaur".Worst of all is the script, co-written by goofball Jason Segal, it's no wonder really. The first hour is just a mish-mash of poorly thought out "Boink-boink" gags, montages, horribly irrelevant song and dance numbers which, in my opinion, totally neglect the intelligence of anyone beyond the age of 5. Chris Cooper's cringe-inducing rap segment...Amy Adams' utterly pointless "Me Party" number...Whoopie Goldberg and Selena Gomez sleep-walking through their tacked on cameos...it really is face-palm worthy.The last 20 minutes or so is where it starts to pick up. Once the Muppets begin their telethon show, things veer into more familiar territory and the gags -including a barber shop quartet to the strains of "Smells Like Teen Spirit"- start to hit the clever absurdist tones we pay to see. But they all come too little too late.I think I would rather remember The Muppets as they were and pretend like this awful venture never happened. A wasted opportunity.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In one weak moment, I decided to watch The Muppets. Yes, I did. Purely on peer pressure despite not being a fan of The Muppet Show and not having watched Muppet Cavalclade or Muppets Jack Sparrow. I'm glad I watched these Muppets though for it has taught me a few of life's most unforgettable lessons. Here is a list of things I learned from The Muppets (in order of appearance).PS: May contain spoilers.The plot basis. The Muppets established a long time ago that the theater belonged to J.P. Grosse (Scooter's uncle); how could Kermit just kind of sign it over to Chris Cooper? OK, that's a nerd point - but it still stands.Miss Piggy is nowhere near as funny without Frank Oz. Jacobsen just isn't getting it done; she doesn't have the same camera presence, the slow pauses and turns towards the camera, etc. The voice is...close enough, I guess, but the puppeteering just lacks.Miss Piggy's violence was always directed in large part towards Kermit, and towards others only secondarily; that's what made it funny. She lashed out when she couldn't have what she wanted more than anything. Now Kermit wants Piggy? Ruins the whole dynamic. Not funny, not interesting.Amy Adams just isn't a very good actress. There, I said it. .The endless Disney/ABC cameo system. Arrrgh! Putting Cars 2 billboards all over the movie? Having Whoopi Goldberg, Rico Rodriguez et al appear in the movie just for some publicity was just too much. What the audience cares - or should care about - is the Muppets, especially the classic characters. You had major characters barely have any role at all. We only caught a fleeting glimpse of Rizzo and Bunsen Honeydew, yet we have to endure an onslaught of celeb cameos which furthered the plot by precisely zero? You can chase your enemies in a BMW coupe which hits other cars at high speed without getting a scratch on it until crashing at a bridge. You can still lose your enemy though, who escapes in an Isuzu pickup truck.No matter how yummy Nachos and Salsa sauce are, if the movie is crap, you should get a refund.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think this movie was confused as to its genre.The Muppet Show was a comedy/variety show and I expected the movie to be a musical comedy like the previous movies. Unfortunately the movie is completely lacking in comedy. Not only is it not funny, it is actually depressingly not funny. Not even Jack Black with his normal clowning around helps. The sight gags are juvenile and unoriginal. There is none of the slick wordplay from the TV show. The parody-like references to the movie making process are very heavy handed and not amusing. Sadly, Fozzie's bad jokes were not as old and worn out as the movie hooks. It was not funny enough to be a comedy, but likewise, it was not dramatic enough to be a drama. The human characters were cartoonish which would have been fine if the movie were comedic, but it was not. So they come across as pathetically lame. By the end of the movie, you have to wonder why you just wasted so much time.The musical numbers sprinkled liberally through the movie do not save it either. They are very contrived and predictable and the lyrics forgettable. Rather than relieve the dramatic tension, set up a plot twist, or make way for something funny they just provide plenty of dead time to go to the bathroom or get a snack.Rarely is a movie so bad that I cannot find anything at all to redeem it, but this one truly is that bad.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Muppets" movie has made me finally except the fact that the Muppets died with Jim Henson 20 years ago. I have been preparing myself for this film for quit some time. I held back any hope so I would would not disappoint myself, but even doing that didn't stop me from being completely deflated after seeing this film. What really sucks about it is that people think this actually good. This isn't a Muppet movie, this is a crappy film with some familiar looking puppets and few mediocre songs.The story is based off of some ironically generic plot that really is more dull then smart. Kermit was a shadow of himself, he was just another puppet pushing the one dimensional storyline. There were no sincere relationships in any two seconds of this film except for the new Muppet Walter and his human brother. Where was the funny banter between Miss Piggy and Kermit, their relationship in this film was so trite and uninteresting. Hardly any of the characters had time to shine. The cameos were sad and forced, mere plugs for Disney's other shows on ABC and Disney channel.Grant it this is suppose to feed off of The Muppet Show so the Muppets in the film are already claimed celebrities but part of the situational humor in their films is that 'real people' characters are usually surprised by the Muppets as being curious talking animals but never quite believe it to be impossible.The songs were whatever, not bad not great, but what I love is when they actually get around to singing Rainbow Connection they take you right out of it. This film is banking on your nostalgia they barely give you a moment to feel it. But they do want to make sure they quench your thirst for crappy 80s songs that are incessantly plugged every 15 minutes in the movie, probably to solidify what ever continuity they think this one note story has.Now for nit picking, the Muppets themselves were poorly created puppets. Miss Piggy does have phases of quality throughout her career but this is the poorest of them all. They also made sure you saw this film as they are, puppets. Every shot in the film was framed the same, waist up. Yes I know they are puppets but usually film gives allowances to be creative and give opportunities for fun life like illusions. You can count on one hand the shots where you saw a Muppet standing. This film highlights minimal imagination and franchise dependency.I am not accustom to bashing anything, but this is a heartbreakingly bad movie. And not even as a Muppet movie but as a movie in general. If you don't believe me watch The Great Muppet Capper. Sorry Jason Segel.</fullReview>

My biggest problem is WHY IS JASON SEGEL'S CHARACTER'S BROTHER A PUPPET ?. Did his mom bang a puppet ? Did his mom have a puppet fetish ?. Was she hit by a voodoo curse while she was pregnant ? Was he cursed by a gypsy when he was a child ? explain movie explain !. Too much of the movie focus on Jason Segel guy and his puppet brother. The film is also a bit too melancholy in spots . I didn't think any of the songs were especially good. Not even the Oscars winning one. The worst being the relentlessly chipper and upbeat "Life's a Happy Song".I would say that Chris Cooper is wasted , But i've seen The Amazing Spider-Man 2 and know what it is to really waste Chris Chopper. . He seems to have a lot of fun playing a cartoonish bad guy. In fact everyone seems to have fun from Jason Segel to Amy Adams to all the celebrities they get to cameo( best part of the movie is all the celebrity cameos. although Adams's presence is slightly troubling since it reminds you of Enchanted a much better Disney movie you could watch instead. In conclusion the Muppets is in no way bad. it's quite good. But i didn't particularly enjoy it and there are better family movies out there. But to end this review on a good note i thought the sequel was very funny. So i've just recommend you to see that instead.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Worthy Return.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Muppets (2011): Dir: James Bobin / Cast: Jason Segel, Amy Adams, Chris Cooper, Rashida Jones, Jack Black: It has been twelve years since the Muppets was last seen on a movie screen. Now the return specifies the reality that technicalities in films have changed. Now digital and computer effects are a major element of films and here we observe how things have changed since the Muppets last aired. For reasons not explained, Jason Segel plays Gary whose brother Walter is in fact a Muppet. Amy Adams plays his girlfriend of ten years, Mary. She desires a commitment but they end up travelling to Hollywood where a visit to the old Muppet studios is met with the news that a rich tycoon named Tex Richman is set to destroy it so he may drill for oil. This means that Gary, Mary and Walter must contact Kermit the Frog and the other Muppets in order to raise the ten million to save it. While the concept is excellent, the structure reduces the road movie element of the first film to a rush. The climax delivers a fantastic Muppet theme that veteran fans will recognize. Segel and Adams are perfectly fitted for the material particularly during outbursts of musical numbers. Chris Cooper as Richman is a cardboard villain that never really materializes. Rashida Jones makes an appearance as a producer bent on filling a spot. Jack Black makes a hilarious cameo as himself being abducted as part of the Muppets show. Great Miss Piggy intro that references The Devil Wears Prada. The Muppets prove that despite the advance technology, they maintain their sincere cheerful disposition. Score: 7 ? / 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A human film acted by puppets</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is about the Muppets having to raise ten million dollars in a charity show, in order to save the Kermit's house from being torn down by an investor."The Muppets" is a lot better than I anticipated. It has a simple plot, but it is sweet and engaging because it tells a tale of friendship and love. Walter is a sweet puppet, and most people can relate to his love for his idols because we have been through that stage as well. There is also romantic relationships and friendships among the puppets too. It is a really human film, even though it is acted by puppets! The surprise cameos of Whoopi Goldberg and Selena Gomez are very funny too, their lines are so funny!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Genuine Hollywood Fluff</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The 2011 musical film, "The Muppets" starring Jason Segal and Amy Adams is a sort of re-imagining of the original Muppet film in 1979. It is definitely a children's film and a farce to say the least. Some parts of the film are lighthearted and funny while others seem elongated and mundane. This film is on par with some of the Muppet television films.The film did win an Academy Award in 2012 for best song, "Man or Muppet" by Bret McKenzie. It's hard to imagine how the Muppets came from their first movie of Kermit searching for Hollywood to a film based more on humans than Muppets. I am hoping that the sequel in 2014 is quite better.I saw a review by someone who said they only remember the Muppets as seen on Sesame Street, but do they not know of "The Muppet Show," a variety show in the late 1970s that had skits and guest stars. It was a lot like a Muppet Saturday Night Live, but for kids.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"It's time to play the music, it's time to light the lights, it's time to meet the Muppets . ."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The iconic introduction to The Muppet Show resonates in hugely nostalgic terms for those of a certain age, though it also struck me as being an allusion to a very noticeable recent Hollywood trend - skip- rummaging through the back catalogue of previously successful intellectual properties in order to recycle/rejuvenate/re-whatever any decades-old quasi-kids show themed licence it can in order to secure another run at a franchise in the present. The Smurfs, Yogi Bear and Alvin &amp; The Chipmunks are other examples of recent attempts at this (with poor to average results), the question for me then being: when and why is it 'time to meet' these characters and worlds again? For the adults who were the original target audience, the memories of enjoying the wondrous, imaginative entertainment is probably enough, so is dragging their beloved characters into the 21st century simply to churn some box-office receipts out of hapless family days out at the cinema excusable? Well, if it's done in the right way, it's arguable that it's the adults, the grown-up kids, who'll be dragging their own kids to the cinema with the learned enthusiasm that their little sprogs don't even possess, unaware as they are of the cultural relevance of the original shows. The kids will then be enthused post-viewing and assist in helping the franchise explore its new lease of life (see Transformers), whilst the adults bask in the sentimental charm. Who, then, is more excited for (re-)meeting the Muppets ? the adults or the kids? Can this kind of unsubtle attempt at 're-franchising' be both commercially successful and maintain the integrity and substance that the original productions worked so hard to establish?The Muppets, possibly unsurprisingly, pulls it off. Disney, Segal and company manage to sidestep the forgetful flatness that this kind of recycling project can bring largely because of its writing and, crucially, its premise. The intentional tongue-in-cheek tone of the Muppets' humour is kept largely intact, and this, coupled with the intelligent self-referential scripting of Segal and Stoller, helps to deliver one of the aforementioned Hollywood rejuvenation projects in a less cynical and more heart-warming fashion. As a direct example there is a scene midway through the film that involves the Muppets, along with fans Gary, Mary and Walter, pitching the return of the show to a dry, uncaring, indifferent TV executive, creating an awareness within the film itself of what it is trying to do ? start all over again. The characters and the writers alike are directly engaged with the very starting point of why the movie they are involved in is in existence in the first place ? to regain that magic. It's unfortunate that a lazily conceived oil baron should be the villain to kick-start the story, but it is how the characters pick up the plot baton and run with it that is so refreshing to see.The self-referencing litters the film without too much risk of being overdone, with hilarious nods to montage, singing monologues, musical clichs, and film clichs in general ("we should travel by map!"). In structuring the narrative around setting up the hopeful success of performing the old format of the show (vaudeville, variety, guest stars), the final act gains excellent momentum come the beginning of the telethon ? required to fund the Muppets' hopes of saving their studio ? and suffers from no lack of clarity as to the motivation of all involved. Gary and Mary's half-baked relationship aside, the characters are all very much invested in the calamitous yet fatally important consequences the 'one last show' event may bring. The perpetual up-and- down/on-off relationship between Kermit and Miss Piggy logically cruises parallel to the main themes, but it is the touching humbleness of superfan Walter that gains the film its unobvious charm. The concept of a muppet aspiring to be a 'Muppet' is some kind of genius in and of itself. In fact, early on in the proceedings, it is Walter that is the source of some of the funniest moments (constant screaming montage/electric fence toss).With all the energy poured into the things that work, however, there are a few misfires to be endured, such as Adams' peculiarly dialled-in performance, a few ripped-off visual gags (sprinkler on window to mimic rain), and one or two self-indulgences from Brett McKenzie's generally pleasant musical supervision that sound like rejects from Flight Of The Conchords. One scene in particular combines almost all of the flaws the film can be said to possess as Adams uncomfortably performs 'Me Party' in a removable scene that interrupts the otherwise smooth flow of story. Die-hards would also point to the absence of specific Muppets characters, but with so many to choose from (and at least one sequel in the pipeline), a few omissions cannot be too damaging for the general viewer.As The Muppets hits its admittedly predictable finale, and a well-known (even for a none-Muppets fan) tune is recited by all during the end credits, the lack of a feeling of indifference is what pleased me the most. Of course there have been Muppets films throughout the last few decades, but this was an attempt to recapture the feel of the original show, and it succeeds through an intelligent concept for the characters to be involved in. It's certainly fair to concede that the original shows are better in probably every respect, but this is not an episode, it's a film that decently proposes a sentimental relation to the series with some care, as opposed to just slapping a title on a poster. For some it will comfort as smiles uncontrollably appear on faces when the stars of the show do their thing. For new viewers it should entertain even if some references fly over the head like a frog thrown by a pig. The fact that it can manage both means it can work, so . . .

		<fullReview>If you, like me, were raised by these wonderful characters during your early years, then this movie will most certainly take you back to some happy memories that might well have been slumbering in the back of your mind for almost 30 years. I can't help but think that that's where the market for this movie came from: nostalgia and it makes me hope that this has spurred some interest in younger audiences to see more of The Muppets for themselves.The movie has all the laughter and toe-tapping music that made The Muppet Show the great show it was. But far more noticeably, it has all the heart of "Rainbow Connection" and "Not Easy Being Green" in spades. While the heartfelt moments take up only a small portion of the actual screen time, they are the parts that resonate with you long after the show has ended. I read a statement from another person who saw this movie in a theater packed with a mostly-adult audience. When The Muppet family join together at one point to perform the old favorite, "Rainbow Connection", there apparently wasn't a dry eye in the house. Even the men were misty-eyed, and I can sympathize. Such is the effect this gem has on us lifelong fans.But make no mistake, this isn't "Shawshank Redemption" dressed in a pointy green collar, there is a ton of fun in this movie, too. It's not afraid to break the forth wall for a good chuckle and there's plenty of good spoof.I thought that the plot line was a brilliant choice for this film. The story of a rag-tag team of underdogs banding together to save a small- time building/institution from a heartless developer was a staple of The Muppets' own era. Dusting it off for a movie like this, a movie about reuniting old friends with old friends, old friends with old fans, works incredibly well. And somehow The Muppets manages to deliver this old storyline with the perfect balance of mirth and sincerity to make it a joy to watch.The voices are all different, and yes, that is often a little jarring. But these are still all the same characters you remember them to be. Kermit's still the long-suffering, kindhearted dreamer who keeps everything together. Fozzie's still a wonderfully terrible comedian. Gonzo's still the master of disaster. And Miss Piggy will forever be the diva to end all divas. Henson isn't dead at all, his spirit is still alive and well in every one of his worldwide-beloved muppet creations, and in the hearts of this new generation of muppeteers whom so obviously cherish his life's work.You would have to have a heart of stone to not love this movie. Call me a dork if you want, but I'm a grown man who isn't afraid to admit that I LOVE THE MUPPETS!!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>For fans that watched this show growing up and for kids</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is mainly for kids and adults that grew up watching The Muppets. Personally I didn't really grew up watching The Muppets, watched it a few times but hardly any. But if you are one of the audiences that grew up watching The Muppets than this will bring some laughter to some that has nostalgic memories of this show. The jokes and everything might be very childish and so very cheesy but it's a kids movie. This movie is basically a musical with good amount of satire. Now the music numbers are forgettable but isn't bad either but the satire in this is actually clever and pretty good. To the point it can lead to few chuckles or laughter. Amy Adams was the perfect choice in this, cause she is just really good in these types of cartoony musicals. Where it blends non-living character with real people. She isn't in this as much though nor does she have a prominent role. Jason Segel is alright for this flick as well since he brings out the goofiness of his character without being serious. In fact most of the way through it seemed like the actor was trying to hold in his laughter in every scene. Maybe he got the job in this cause he played the puppet guy in "Forgetting Sarah Marshall". Overall if your a fan of The Muppets or at least grew up watching it than you might have some few nostalgic times with this and it's a alright flick to take the whole family. But it's easily forgettable with a story that doesn't really stick.5/10</fullReview>

The songs are good and Man Or A Muppet lives up to the hype. The characters are as endearing as ever and Disney do justice to Henson's classic creations.The story has it's problems and in five years time some of the people who appear in cameos will have faded from memory but for 2012 audiences they work.I'm no Jason Segel fan but you can't fault him for the sheer enthusiasm that he brings to the film and is supported well by Amy Adams who does this sort of film in her sleep. If you like the Muppets or just want a good family film then this could be the one for you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Introducing the Muppets to a New Generation...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's time to play the music. It's time to light the lights. It's time to meet the Muppets (again) because Jason Segal wasn't content to let a long-beloved franchise remain dead. Segal's case of puppet love was brought to light during FORGETTING SARAH MARSHALL, and it was only a matter of time before he THE MUPPETS happened. Everyone knows Kermit the frog and his crew, but it's not hard to see that newer generations of children aren't really getting any exposure to them. It's been a good while since they've been in the limelight; we haven't had a real Muppet movie in theaters since 1999. The franchise was due for a return, if only to keep it from slowly draining out of the public consciousness. Now, I was an 80's kid so I was more "Muppet Babies" than "Muppet Show" but it was enough to instill me with a love for the characters from a young age so I was definitely going to be checking this movie out. The movie acknowledges that the Muppets haven't been popular in a while and, as the movie begins, they have each moved on with their lives. Kermit lives in solitude in his Bel-Air estate, Fozzie is headlining a Muppets tribute band in Reno, Gonzo has become a successful plumbing magnate, etc. The movie focuses on brothers Gary and Walter; for the record, Walter is (somehow) a Muppet. Walter tags along when Gary takes his girlfriend Mary to Los Angeles for their anniversary, and a visit to the dilapidated Muppet Studios leads to a discovery that evil oil baron Tex Richman plans on buying the studio when the contract expires and knocking it down for drilling. Walter convinces Kermit to reunite the gang and put on one more show to try and raise the money to save the theater and the Muppets' legacy.The easiest way to describe this movie is pure nostalgia. There's enough family-friendly fun for children of a new generation to get on board with the Muppets but this movie is even more dedicated to their established fans. This entire movie is a love letter from Jason Segal to the original "Muppet Show". Everyone's favorite characters make their triumphant returns, with a few exceptions (what, no Rizzo?!). There's something here for all fans, and the movies makes plenty of throwback references to Muppet favorites of the past. Seeing as how the film is about the gang is attempting to put on a "Muppet Show" style telethon, there are plenty of reminders sprinkled throughout. Plenty of occurrences of the opening theme, a subtle shout- out to Pigs in Space, scattered photos of former hosts on set, and a celebrity host (in the form of a reluctant Jack Black). And it wouldn't be a Muppet movie without musical numbers. There's a few originals, including the Academy Award winning "Man or Muppet", as well as a few classics such as "Rainbow Connection". To be honest, I was a little put-off by how incredibly happy some of the numbers were. Like, really really happy. Sickeningly so. When Gary and Walter first bust out in "Life's a Happy Song", I admit I rolled my eyes and hoped the rest of the movie wouldn't be so sugar-sweet. For the most part, it wasn't. It was a perfect blend of goofy humor and light-hearted fare.This was a fun movie and absolutely enjoyable for fans of any age. Segal was living his dream here as Gary, starring in his own Muppet movie. A little too much fun, really. He could've toned it down at times. Amy Adams was a perfect choice for the movie as Mary. The woman, beaming happiness, looks as if she was raised in a Disney film. Chris Cooper is the movie's villain, Tex Richman. I could've done without his hip-hop musical number, but he was classic Muppet villain with his evil scheme and "maniacal laugh". Being that this is a Muppet movie, there is also a constant stream of celebrity cameos popping up throughout the film. Andy Rooney, Sarah Silverman, Whoopi Goldberg, and Neil Patrick Harris are just a few of the famous faces taking a moment to be a part of the latest Muppet adventure. As fun as it all was, I really thought the movie was lacking something. It could drag at times and the whole Gary/Mary subplot got in the way. This is a Muppet movie, and the relationship drama bit could've been left out. Otherwise, it's a fun time and I totally recommend it for Muppet fans new and old.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Muppets</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The reboot of the muppets' franchise is a well-timed measure, since most of my generation and after has scanty idea of Kermit the frog and his devoted sidekicks. Saw the film on the plane, while the video quality is barely serviceable, but I can get the gist. The film is a retrospective musical aiming to a very regional demography, which is unusual for a family Christmas flick, the reboot may not put its emphasis on attracting large part of the younger generation, which could be explained by its underwhelmed box-office for a Christmas hit ($88,631,237 lifetime gross is profitable but embarrassing), instead the traditional storyline and pre-teen designed perception could generally cater for the need in a satisfactory way, but otherwise, it is not a cash-burning production anyway. Jason Segel and Amy Adams pair is lovable enough and their musical numbers are tender and joyful, Chris Cooper's impromptu rap is self-aware and funny, although none of them could steal the thunder from the gang of muppets, with an awesome behind-the-camera puppeteers and voice rendition, as a newcomer, I could understand why it is a pop sensation for kids, my favorite is no doubt Ms. Piggy, a devil wears PRADA parody hasn't dated yet. Numerous cameos are requisite as the more the merrier, one noteworthy presence of Jim Parsons as the incarnation of Walter, our muppet hero, during the duet of MAN OR MUPPET, is the sheer highlights (sonically and optically), the Oscar-winning melody is reminiscent of the best of old Hollywood musicals, but still it's not a film I could revel in.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The return of the Muppets</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Walter, a Muppet, and his human brother Gary (Jason Segel) are fans of The Muppet Show in their youth. Gary brought his girlfriend of ten years Mary (Amy Adams) to Los Angeles for a holiday to celebrate their tenth anniversary. Walter was also brought along so he could tour the Muppet Studios.During a tour of the abandoned studios, Walter sneaked into the office of Kermit the Frog and chanced upon a conversation between Statler and Waldorf and the oil magnate Tex Richman (Chris Cooper) who was with his henchmen Uncle Deadly and Bobo the Bear. Richman has plans to destroy the studios and dig for oil underneath. The catch for the Muppets to repurchase their studios before it falls into Richman's hands - $10 million.After overhearing what Richman has planned, Walter decided to warn Gary and Mary about it, but only after he got over the shock of what he had overheard. The trio then search for Kermit the Frog at his mansion and a plan was underway for a telethon to raise money to repurchase the studios where Kermit decided to search for his former Muppets where they would organise a show to do just that.It is a film with various scenes to warm the hearts, with The Muppets reuniting those whom used to remember watching the group in their younger days on the silver screen. It is part-film, part-musical where songs were being sung along the way in the search for the various Muppets, wherever they may be. Even for those who may not know anything about the Muppets, this may help to bring out the child in them when watching the film.</fullReview>

It also took the crown for best song and dance number of the year away from its previous title holder A Very Harold and Kumar Christmas.it had lots excitement and fun song and dance numbers. They also took it down a notch to teach some life lessons in a family friendly way.

It's a nice movie, funny and sweet, with a terrific performance by Amy Adams and some cute celebrity cameos. Three of the songs are by Brett McKenzie of Flight of the Conchords and they are quite fun, especially Muppet or Man. Obviously, if you're a huge fan of the original show you would rate this higher than I do. I still don't care for Fozzie or Piggy, and I found the final recreation of the show a little too close to the original for my taste. But of course, that's what fans would want.

		<fullReview>I never grew up with the Muppets as a kid, but I did remember watching the family Christmas special on Disney Channel in Australia. But I mainly grew up with Sesame Street, which are made by the same company, 'The Jim Henson Company', but this movie makes me feel like I did. The joke's are hilarious, the songs are catchy, memorable and funny and the plot was brilliant too. The movie brings that sense of nostalgia back to people who grew up with these Muppets since the beginning of 'The Muppet Show' in 1975. However I must admit, hearing 'Rainbow Connection' in the movie did get me a little teary eyed. However whether you're a Muppet fan or not, this movie is fun for kids, great for people who grew up with the Muppets and if your not fan, this movie can turn you into one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disorganized craziness, but what else do you expect from The Muppets?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I never was a big watcher of the Muppets but my kids were. So I got some by sideways observation. In this 2011 movie, the Muppets have long since been dissolved and each member is living his or her life apart from the others. Miss Piggy for example is a fashion executive in Paris. But I am getting ahead of the story.Jason Segel is Gary, living in a small town in the heartland of the USA. He has a brother named Walter. Gary grows and progresses normally but Walter, who looks and sounds like a Muppet, stays the same size as time goes by, and remains looking the same. Like a Muppet. Amy Adams is always a favorite of mine and here she is Gary's long-time girlfriend Mary. They decide to go to Los Angeles to celebrate their being together for 10 years. Mary would prefer it had been just the two of them but Gary insists on bringing Walter along. On a tour they come across the old and dilapidated building and office of Kermit the Frog. They also come across the dastardly oil man, Chris Cooper as Tex Richman. He has hatched a scheme to get the property, tear it down, and drill for oil.That really becomes the spark for the main story in the movie, where Kermit attempts to get the Muppets back together for a televised fund-raising show so that they can save the property and keep it out of the hands of Tex. And for Walter to come into his own and become a member of The Muppets.The movie is done much in the style of a musical with several production numbers. While Segel, Adams, and Cooper will never be mistaken for professional singers, they did a fine and entertaining job. Just a fluff of a movie, for almost 2 hours of entertainment. If you don't care for the Muppets then you probably should not waste your time on it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Through the Filters of Nostalgia</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can't tell a lie - I enjoyed The Muppets. I enjoyed it a lot, probably more than almost any other movie in 2011. So why am I giving it 7/10? Because I acknowledge that it's just not that good. The big problem is that The Muppets works on nothing but nostalgia fuel. If you don't have any real feeling towards the muppets, or any fond memories of the original Muppet Show, you probably won't enjoy it.It's not a completely bad thing. This new installment is a real joy for muppet fans, and probably the most solid muppet movie since the first. It's filled to the brim with self-aware humor and inside jokes that only long-time fans will get. There's lots of fun to be had - constant breaking of the fourth wall in finest muppet tradition, wonderful musical numbers with songs by Flight of the Conchords' Bret McKenzie, many obscure Muppets making surprise appearance, and some cool cameo appearances. Most importantly, the movie was clearly made with tons of love for the muppets; Jason Segel really is a muppet of a man, after all. That love is infectious, and if you've ever loved the original show you're going to enjoy the movie.Along the way, though, The Muppets loses the rest of the audience, and since it's a family movie after all, that's pretty essential. Young children are not likely to get what the fuss is about; those who knew the Muppets only in passing probably will be lost too. It doesn't help that the human actors take up way too much of the spotlight, or that some of the musical numbers make no sense in or out of context. The movie is made by fans for fans, and if you love the muppets then you'll love The Muppets.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Muppets is a delightful feel good movie for kids and parents or any with fond memories of the Muppet show on TV.It is never serious and has surprisingly good writing and songs that are not forced as sometimes happens in musicals like this.Like previous Muppet movies the main muppet characters are gradually collected and introduced. Though sweet to the point of irritation the live actors hold their own. My least favorite muppets,Gonzo's chickens,give probably the most hilarious performance as they had the audience I viewed the film with and this reviewer laughing to tears. There are many cameos and it deserved its Oscar for best song.It'really too bad the Oscars don't do the nominated songs live anymore as this could have lightened up a really dry Oscar night.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>New Muppets movie, same old Muppets fun.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Delightful. That word describes The Muppets &nbsp;better than any other word that readily comes to mind. This movie is fun, funny and charming in a way that easily appeals to kids and adults. That pretty much sums up my review, but IMDb insists on more content in their user reviews than that, so I'll give a bit more detail.&nbsp;The story is a simple one, with the Muppets getting back together after drifting their separate ways to put on a huge show to save their old theater. A new Muppet, Walter, his human brother Gary (Jason Segal) and Gary's girlfriend Mary (Amy Adams) take a trip to Los Angeles that sparks the whole storyline. Segal and Adams are great, singing and charming their way through the movie while leaving plenty of space for the Muppets to be the clear stars of the show. Celebrity cameos are numerous and usually hilarious.&nbsp;The frequent songs are catchy and amusing ("Me Party" was pretty much the highlight of the whole film in my opinion), the dynamics and chemistry between the Muppets seem as good as ever, and best of all, it's almost impossible to not have a smile on your face while watching The Muppets. I didn't enjoy the movie so much that I was oblivious to its flaws, though. The pacing suffered at times, the movie peaked too early for me (the first 70% was better than the last act), Chris Cooper was largely mishandled as the villainous Tex Richman (great name, by the way), and the ending fizzled. Oh, and there wasn't nearly enough Amy Adams, but I'm willing to admit that's probably just an issue on my end (she's one of my favorite actresses).&nbsp;Still, those issues didn't change the fact that I enjoyed The Muppets a lot. Be you an old fan or a newcomer, give it a shot.&nbsp;</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fun-filled comeback for Kermit and friends.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Disclosure: I've never seen any Muppet shows or movies before. I'm what you would call 'uninitiated'. After 103 minutes of watching Kermit and friends get their careers back on track in The Muppets (their last noteworthy effort being 1992's The Muppet Christmas Carol), chalk me up as a fan. From the innocent humour to the lyrically clever musical numbers ? the 'Am I a Muppet or a Man?' ballad at the midway point is a highlight ? this return to public consciousness for Jim Henson's puppets is a fun-filled one. Star, co-writer and self-confessed Muppet-obsessive Jason Segal is essentially the sole reason this film got off the ground, and in the lead human role of Gary, he is clearly having a blast; as is perennial sweet girl Amy Adams as his girlfriend Mary. With a multitude of cameos ranging from old-timers Mickey Rooney and Alan Arkin to younger celebs like Emily Blunt and John Krasinski, this comeback event ticks all the right boxes and is sure to put a smile on your face.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's time to welcome back the Muppets!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For most people, they know who the Muppets are. Ever since the mid 50's, the late-Jim Henson has made the Muppets become such iconic figures. Kermit, Fozzie, Gonzo, Miss Piggy, Rowlf, Sam the Eagle, Swedish Chef, and many others. They've had an ongoing history and ever since, have gotten much from Jim Henson and Frank Oz, even getting their own show and a few movies to it as well.The first film, "The Muppet Movie", showed the origins of the Muppets and how they met up. It had the great feel of a road trip movie, as well as spawning many cameos from famous actors at the time of the late-70s, like Mel Brooks, Dom Deluise, Steve Martin, Bob Hope, Carol Kane, Richard Pryer, even Orson Welles. It was a great start, for a great gang of characters we all have now come to love, which is why it was the film that most people remembered. As for "The Great Muppet Caper" and "Muppets Take Manhattan," I don't remember much of it, but everyone has said that they were pretty good for what they're worth, so I'll take their word for it. As for "Muppet Christmas Carol," it was something that really had much passion to it, with keeping true to the Charles Dickens classic. With it being the first film the Muppets did without Jim Henson, after his tragic death in 1990, "Muppet Christmas Carol" showed us that no matter what, the legacy would never die out. Now for "Muppet Treasure Island," I do remember some things from it, like the opening number being such an enjoyable way to start a movie, and Tim Curry giving one heck of a great performance. But aside from that, not much else can be said about it. With their last theatrical film, "Muppets from Space," I haven't seen. Many people have stated that it wasn't really good or that it was alright for what it was. If that's what people think, then more power to them, since I cannot compare my opinion with them.Now let's get down to the newest movie. How does it hold up? Well, I have to be honest, it's pretty good. It's a fun, entertaining, enjoyable, family movie. It's got just about everything you'd expect in a Muppet movie. Singing, dancing, cameos, an interesting story, 4th wall jokes, and obviously, the Muppets. With what this new film has given, it works and is appropriate to show kids of this generation who they are, as well as give off a great deal of nostalgia to those who've grown up with them. Even though, Frank Oz and other Muppet veterans have disregarded it, as a mockery, just to cash in on the 'Judd Apatow style of gross-out humor', like with the fart shoes you see Fozzie wear in the trailer. It didn't bother me much, despite the fact that I'm not a fan of Judd Apatow to begin with. Even Kermit can agree that it's just a cheap joke, and it's hilarious to know that an iconic character knows that films that follow that similar format that think they're funny, by using the 'f' word constantly, or just making dumb gross jokes; that type of humor does work sometimes, if it isn't overused, but when it's used throughout the majority of one film, then it gets old really fast. Going back to the new Muppet film, it really does its best to try and be something new, instead of just a mindless remake like most movie studios have been doing since the late nineties. Surprisingly to most, this movie is actually a continuation of the Muppets, instead of rehashing the whole thing from scratch. It shows where Kermit and friends have been, what happened, and how they get back together again.Jason Segel did an excellent job co-writing the script, and giving off one of the best performances of his career in a movie. I could tell with the look in his eyes that he was a big Muppets fan, and wanted to give them the film they deserved after such a long time. Not only that, but with him being a Broadway kind of guy, he really has an amazing singing voice, from the opening song that he does, that's really catchy. I also enjoyed the chemistry between him and his adoptive Muppet brother, to where you could feel a bit teary eyed at the sad scenes with them. Amy Adams did a great job with this too, and was pretty enjoyable as the lead actress. She was funny, she was charming, and knew how to give such a great performance. Plus, I gotta give props to Chris Cooper, for almost every scene he was in making me laugh. The cameos they had in this film made me pleased, counting out most of them, and for how they made they're screen time so great in such a small amount of time.Now even with how good this was, the only complaint I had with the movie was the ending. Not that it was bad or anything, but it built up to a point where you feel it taking another direction you never thought they'd go, like a very adult and mature ending. I felt that with all that build up, you think that they'd actually had the guts to go there. But despite that, I found it to be one of those perfect movies.Overall, The Muppets is a film that has a lot of passion and shows great respect to the franchise. I highly recommend it for anyone who wants that feel of nostalgia, or someone who's just looking for a good film to go to. It surely won't disappoint.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>yes, it is possible, a Muppets movie that sucks</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is proof that when Disney places its evil hands over something, it just screws it. They did it with Pixar: 'the statistics say that our target group likes racing cars, and all our movies need a stupid/goofy looking character to act as a sidekick of the protagonist, and we expect that looking stupid it will look funny'. But if some deadweights didn't come up with sentences like the one above, how could they justify that their checks are way bigger than the ones of the people who make real work, or have actually any ideas, and made the company they just bought what it was. I didn't watch this movie when it was presented in theaters (though I wanted to), but just saw it recently as a TV broadcast. Don't expect to see the humor you know from previous muppet movies; go prepared instead to watch a movie intended for toddlers who are just learning to talk, and their parents go with them to see a puppet movie. Go prepared to watch a movie full of clichs and a predictable plot. The only thing this movie was lacking was a needy princess that needed to be rescued.. ohh wait, it kind of had something like that..</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A rag-tag bunch of fluff-headed goons, bouncing and flailing as if their limbs are being manipulated with rods, yelping confused babble at each other through flapping mouths?but that's enough about *insert your football team of choice* this current campaign. (Unless of course, you're a Watford fan who can neither read, think nor have any concept of anything bar their own faeces.)Much as it is now Alex McLeish's Villa, it is now Disney's The Muppets: the all-conquering, worst example of child exploitation ever now taking over from the Jim Henson label, the great Villa manager of the late 1970s. So, does this new branding disappoint? Well, the jokes are terrible and the songs worse?so business as usual for the Muppets then. Having said that, while the songs were generally the boring parts of the previous films, they're a little bit too frequent and bad here.Having co-written the script, Jason Segal hogs far too much screen time, turning it into a vehicle to discuss the size of his own anal sphincter. In terms of cameos, some are good, though many are just thrown in for mere seconds of screen time, though honourable mentions must go to Whoopi Goldberg and Tony Blair as Kermit the Frog. But generally, while okay, this just isn't as good as the previous Muppet films, falling way short of The Muppet Christmas Carol: The greatest story ever told.www.politic1983.blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Thrill is Gone</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the songs in the first part of this comeback tentative of The Muppets is called 'Can We Do It Again?'. To some extent it resumes the story and the history of this film. The story because the film is about the legendary Muppets getting together 30 years after in order to save the studios from being acquired and turned to something else by a heartless tycoon. The history because the same question can be asked by the viewers, some of them trying to find back the charm of the original shows into their memories, other completely new to the concept, which may have led to a multitude of replicas and sequels but also had its own charm, value, humor which I am not sure can really be reborn 'as is'. At least not in James Bobin's version.I was a great fan of The Muppets. In the 70s and early 80s, under the direction of Jim Henson the show was capable of bringing into its 20-25 minutes of nonsense some of the best performers of the period, from Harry Belafonte to Joan Baez. Unfortunately the version realized by the Disney Studios rarely raises over the level of a musical for kids, and the worst thing it that it does not aim much higher. I should have suspected, as I can hardly remember any good coming out of the Disney brand that was not created by Disney himself. His followers seem to have embraced a puritan approach to kids and teenager culture, but Disney's world of ferries was much more than kids entertainment, it was great story telling, it was sharp humor close to cruelty sometimes, it was a whole universe of cultural references, it was art daring to push the limits. Staying beyond the limits of the Disney universe of the 50s is the great mistake the studio and the style they embraced ever made. Their acquiring of the Muppets brand from the inheritors of Jim Henson Sr. may be the mortal hit to the concept, at least if we are to judge after this 2011 production.Nothing or almost nothing of the old show charm is on screen for this production. Music is mostly banal, humor almost absent, the characters as they slowly get back together seem all to be playing the role of the two old guys in the gallery rather then their own roles. I wonder how Jack Black accepted to play in this film. Oh, yes, I forgot, he was kidnapped, tied and forced to put a show on stage! And he is not credited (why? really!). Or maybe he was just a kid by the time the original show was run, watching it and dreaming to be a star in it, and ready to do anything to become one. As a grown up he could have skipped this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the humor wasn't there</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I loved the Muppets when I was a kid. I watched the TV show and loved the Muppet movies. With that being said, perhaps a 10 year old would really love this film; however, I was disappointed. This movie just didn't seem as funny or fun as the other Muppet movies. There also wasn't a lot of singing numbers as in previous films. Miss Piggy and Kermie were always my favorites, but Piggy wasn't her bossy self in a way that's funny.In the movie, an evil oil baron is buying the old Muppet studios to tear down to drill for oil. Walter, a huge Muppet fan, over hears this and him and his brother, Gary, track down Kermit to warn him. They decide to get the gang together to have a fund raiser to save the studios.FINAL VERDICT: Perhaps young kids would enjoy this more, I felt it was a step down from the other Muppet movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's The Blues Brothers, Muppet style, but without the zing!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My nephew is obsessed with The Muppets. That's actually not much of an exaggeration, either. Ever since I introduced him to series one of the great, peerless, supreme The Muppet Show, he's dragged around a battered Fozzie, recognized the tune or a picture at forty paces and referred to bananas as mah-na mah-nas, although the link is beyond me. But even he doesn't think much of this cinematic outing.What a pity. What a waste. After such an absence, the opportunity Jason Segal (as writer and human star) was handed was immense but, alas, he failed in his mission. He didn't quite break The Muppets in the way Spielberg broke Indiana Jones in the fourth outing, Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, (an utter travesty and possibly an unforgivable act) but he's certainly injured the spirit of them and disappointed a forty-year old and his two-year old nephew.On a trip to the Muppet Theatre, Walter, the Muppet brother of Gary (Segal), is horrified to discover that it's in a terrible state of disrepair, that it is about to be razed to the ground by Tex Richman (Chris Cooper) as he's discovered oil underneath it and that Muppets have all gone their separate ways. Only $10million will rescue the iconic theatre from destruction and there's only one way to achieve that. Yes, let's put the band back together. We're on a mission from God? Yup, it's The Blues Brothers, Muppet style.Unfortunately it doesn't have the music (despite the Oscar-winning song, Man or Muppet), it doesn't have the humour, it doesn't have the humiliation of Nazis and it doesn't have the stars.While the stars of The Muppet Show were always, irrefutably, the Muppets themselves, it was the human co-stars that provided so much humour, by being the brunt of so many escapades, and who attracted so much interest. The genius of Crocodile Rock was not in the adaptation by the Muppets but the fact that Elton John was central to it.In The Muppets, (which, before I go any further is hardly an original or inspiring title to stand alongside The Great Muppet Caper, The Muppet Christmas Carol etc.) we manage Segal, Cooper, Amy Adams, Zach Galifianakas, Ken Jeong, Alan Alda, Whoopi Goldberg and Emily Blunt. Yes, they're 'names' and Blunt's star is in the ascendancy but none is an A-lister. We used to have Julie Andrews, Roger Moore, Vincent Price, Bob Hope, Christopher Reeve, Johnny Cash, Marty Feldman, Liberace, Alice Cooper, Peter Ustinov, Spike Milligan, Luke Skywalker!!! I'm sorry, Emily Blunt is wonderful and causes my heart to flutter but she isn't yet an acting heavyweight, nor is she worthy to swing a lightsaber and Animal deserves to share the stage with somebody with more clout than her. The Muppets is a fun film, of course, but there's no edge to it. It plods along predictably and lacks that extra zing that was in abundance in the series (discounting, of course, the horrible updated series, Muppets Tonight, at the end of the 90s ? now there's something that was broken!) and the best of the films like Christmas Carol and Treasure Island.The Muppets isn't horrendous but it's bland. It's fun(ish) without being funny. Its unoriginal, it's disappointing and it doesn't have Michael Caine singing Thankful Heart. If you love the Muppets, if you never stopped growing up on them, then you'll fall for moments of magic and appreciate the mere appearance of your Muppet heroes (for me, it's Animal, Swedish chef and Crazy Harry) but in the words of two-year old hero of mine, "Muppets no not real."

		<fullReview>I was looking so forward to seeing this movie. I missed it while in the theatres and just watched it on DVD. I loved all of their movies as a kid. I'm in my 30s now. I have to say that I was disappointed with the movie, it just seemed like it was missing something; or like the movie was thrown together over night, similar to the 48 hour window in the movie. I loved Amy Adams in the movie, who is always like a breath of fresh air but the musical numbers were only so/so. On one end, I was disappointed but on the other end, the kid in me was just happy to see the whole gang again! - Except, for one character who had about a 5 second cameo - Rizzo the Rat. He is probably my all time favorite and would have liked to see more of him. Who knows, maybe he asked for too much money to do the movie. Waka Waka.So, was I disappointed? Yes...but it's the Muppets! It's kind of difficult to be too disappointed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>No, it's not Sunday morning. But "it's time to play the music. It's time to light the lights". Here they are! Kermit and the whole gang are back! The Muppets are carrying one last show to raise money. In order to maintain their studio before the evil oil tycoon shatters it down. There is only one problem. Have they been forgotten? With the real world reflects just like the story in thiz movie, since the very first stage of movie-making process, thiz movie was way underrated. People kept asking, would thiz movie actually work? Anyway, look how well the movie is doing now. The stars sparkle all over the place. The famous frog Kermit, Miss Piggy, Fozzie Bear, Gonzo, Scooter, Animal and other members of The Muppets, can bring the hilarious atmosphere instantly, including the new introduced character Walter. Jason Segel proves out to be surprisingly talented with his energetic singing and dancing. "Enchanted" (2007) princess Amy Adams is a brilliant choice for her role, she is an unarguable Disney princess figure in human form. The bad guy looks cynical and funny at the same time, played very very well by Chris Cooper. Not to mention, it's featuring endless celebrity guests such as Jack Black, Emily Blunt, Zach Galifianakis, Whoopi Goldberg, Selena Gomez, Ken Jeong, Sarah Silverman, Neil Patrick Harris, John Krasinski and even Dave Grohl from the rock band "Foo Fighters". James Bobin made his directorial debut through thiz movie. The songs are part of thiz musical extravaganza. The singles like "Life's a Happy Song", "Me Party" or "Man or Muppet" are one of the best moments. The ending scene is effective (Spoiler Alert!). When is told that they have finally got the appreciation and applause from millions of people outside the studio. It's simply to say, we could have happy tears together. It's not just about The Muppets anymore. But it's also about every one of us who have grown up with these guys. Whether we realize it or not, in that very moment, we had a sort of feeling, it's like we looked back the years we had been through and we suddenly realized how much we had already changed. The innocent world that we once had does exist. The creator Jim Henson must be proud of what they have done. Thanks, guys. Thanks for bringing us the third greatest gift of all, which is the laughter! When they do, they've got the whole wide world in the palm of their hand.Visit My Blog on JONNY'S MOVEE: http://jonnyfendi.blogspot.com</fullReview>

Crammed with off-the-wall humour, hugely entertaining song and dance routines (including the Oscar-winning Man or Muppet), chickens, star cameos, and hilarious visual gags, this is one film that even the presence of Jack Black couldn't stop me from enjoying.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Having seen only two Muppet films prior to this movie it was a pleasant surprise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having not seen any episodes of The Muppet Show (Writ. Jim Henson, 1976- 1981), The Muppets (Dir. James Bobin, 2012) is the third Muppet production I have seen; with The Muppet Christmas Carol (Dir. Brian Henson, 1992) and Muppet Treasure Island (Dir. Brian Henson, 1996) preceding it. For this reason I cannot personally say I have the same respect and admiration for the Muppet franchise, having not shared my childhood with their TV show.From the very start of the film we are expected to believe that Gary's (Jason Segel) brother Walter, who is a puppet, is actually his brother and no-one has ever questioned that they look completely different. I am, of course, willing to accept this reality as I am watching The Muppets. This film knows it is a film, and therefore gets away with bending reality. The story follows the characters of Gary, Walter and Mary (Amy Adams) as they travel to Los Angeles to reunite the Muppets before their studio is sold to an "evil" oil tycoon. This story, although very basic, is heart-warming and a satisfying return for the Muppets.Some of the jokes are childish, but none of them are humourless. The Muppets relies upon its alternative and amusing characters to drive the film forward for an hour and forty-five minutes. This time is filled up with fantastic anecdotes from Statler and Waldorf, the two balcony hecklers; a Muppets TV Telethon full of comical gags and of course an enormous amount of songs and musical montages. These songs are fantastic! The Oscar winning "Man or Muppet", composed by Flight of the Concords' Bret McKenzie, was a joy to watch with its incredible editing, celebrity cameos and emotional lyrics. The other songs throughout The Muppets were just as entertaining, apart from the few short songs that felt unneeded.The characters of Kermit and Walter have the most facial expression variation out of all the Muppets, and perhaps all the actors within the film. The human characters show less emotion to enable the audience to relate more to the Muppets than to Segal or Adams, or at least I hope this is the reason they present very underdeveloped and flat characters.One real problem I had with the film was the over excessive, and sometimes very visible, use of CGI, Computer-Generated Imagery. As they are using puppets, rather than animated characters, I had only expected a small amount of computer imagery and was shocked and disappointed at the amount of noticeable special effects there were. It seemed almost like the Muppets suffered the same budgetary restrictions as they do in The Muppets.I am predicting that after the success of this film, The Muppet Show is likely to return to our screens in the near future. Whether or not Kermit will be the protagonist is questionable as Walter has a similar body shape and facial expressions to Kermit. Could the Muppets be considering replacing the little green frog?Having only seen two Muppet movies prior to this I was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed this movie. It does suffer some terrible use of CGI and it is 20 minutes too long. These faults aside, this movie was fantastic. A basic narrative driven by Kermit, Miss Piggy and the newly introduced character of Walter help push the Muppets back into the hearts and minds of audiences throughout the world. My prediction still stands, keep your eyes open for another Muppet movie or the return of The Muppet Show.http://dalelawsonreviews.tumblr.com/</fullReview>

So obviously, he needs to save them in order to be part of their family... Obviously.The opening songs are insanely cheesy, but knowing Jason Segel's back catalogue of work, it makes it OK. You know he's just taking the mick. This along with the characters taking to the audience makes it the perfect parody. There is some shameful self-promotion from Disney with the likes of a Cars 2 poster in a couple of background shots, but thats OK too (this time it's just because I like Disney).It's packed with 80s nostalgia, so many cameos (Dave Grohl and Mickey Rooney included) and tonnes of laughs.

And most of them were not that good. This movie borrows probably from all other muppet movies. Is that bad? No, because it is done right. So don't expect a great story, you know where it is going after watching it for about 5 minutes. Yet, it is so entertaining! A true muppet movie. A real shame that Frank Oz did not want to participate (I can understand that since his script did not make it to the final film). I think the only real bad thing is that one of the writers is also an actor. Jason Segel wrote a nice script... but if you also let an actor write, you can make sure that he will appear in shots where he is not needed at all. And that is exactly what happened. All that is left to say is: MORE MORE</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's time to light the lights for a triumphant return.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love Jim Henson's work, from 'Sesame Street' to 'Fraggle Rock' via 'The Muppet Show'. That his creations are still going years after his sad demise is a testament to how much he entertained the world with zany puppet-powered madness. 'The Muppets' are no strangers to the big screen, having debuted in 'The Muppet Movie' of 1979. Here they return to re-conquer cinema in the name of fun. One the whole they succeed, giving us a light souffl of corny jokes, visual gags and a lot of celebrity cameos. Chris Cooper obviously has a ball playing Tex Richman, the oil tycoon set on destroying the Muppet Studios. An interesting fact is that Jason Segel is both a screen writer and star in this feature. He's Gary, brother to puppet Walter who's the world's biggest Muppet fan. At Walter's insistence they, along with Gary's long suffering girlfriend Mary (Amy Adams) try to reunite The Muppets and save the studios. It's a basic plot that's been done before in countless films and T.V. shows, but here it doesn't feel worn out. Instead it's used as an excuse to re-introduce all the main Muppets as they're brought back from their new lives. Most entertainingly Fozzie Bear is working in a tribute band called 'The Moopets', which includes Dave Grohl as 'Animool'. Having brothers where one's human and the other's a puppet as main characters is inspired and leads to the fantastic song 'Man or Muppet'. Of course, if you're not a fan of The Muppets or the style of humour they use you won't like this movie. However, if you are a fan I guarantee you'll enjoy this and be laughing as much as me when 80's Robot turns on his Modem. Whilst it doesn't reach the highs of 'The Muppets Christmas Carol' or 'Muppets Treasure Island'; 'The Muppets' gives us more of what we know and love.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Independent and mainstream cross-over makes for an interesting film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have previously written about the Muppet 'franchise' when discussing the last great Muppet movie (The Great Muppet Caper (1981)). I had stated the brilliance of the late Jim Henson who began this visual plethora of beautiful characters. At a later stage I will be writing something more personal and fundamentally reflexive of his career, but at this point I will simply comment on this particular film that attempts to combine the love of a new audience with the more ferrel likes of it's original fans.Since 1984's The Muppets Take Manhattan, the film career of the Muppet's has taken a very slow decline. OK, so the Christmas Carol adaptation was genuinely brilliant (adequately emphasised by repeat Christmas broadcasting), but subsequent films have been incredibly questionable. So after about 12 years in obscurity, the Muppets seem to make a comeback? Well, possibly. It was an absolute joy when I discovered that Nicholas Stoller and Bret McKenzie (of Flight of the Conchords fame) were advertised as being involved. This film, it would seem, would be a film fundamentally aimed at the people that were originally influenced by the band of felt characters.The story of an oil tycoon, Tex Richman (Chris Cooper), who wants to overtake the Muppet studios, due to an apparent oil flow under said ground, is a very obvious choice of story arc in the cannon of Muppet movies. This was unfortunately an apparently contentious issue with the always level-headed Fox News (sic). (As a side-line they stated that this film was communist in it's ideological stance - cause it didn't show an evil Obama administration - check the webosphere if you think I'm making this s**t up!)The story of the rebranding of the Muppets is fundamental to the full concept of this film. We see motifs taken from the more interesting films of the cannon. Muppet movies are always self-reflexive, and almost always comment on the fact that what is happening is in fact film making! The crux of this particular film hinges on Walter. He is essentially a Muppet, but has been brought up as the brother of Jason Segal's Gary. Walter, essentially represents the generation that this film represents. What the Muppet franchise holds, is something that was not represented through the 1990's (certainly after the death of Jim Henson).Every element of this film is entirely made for the audience that firstly succumbed to the wonder back in 1976 (as well as previously through Sesame Street). All good Muppet movies are self-reflexive. They are able to transport the viewer to place that transcends their adult life, bringing them back to a place of absolute comfort. Not only does the presence of a character like Animal bring you back to a child-like state, but it also rekindles your concept of values.With all The Muppets propensity to good, the fact that the film seems to have a cross-over of independent and mainstream ideas makes the film far more interesting than the usual "kiddie" fodder. I'm guessing that only time will tell if the non-computerised Muppets will endure any further beyond their felt restrictions. For my money, I would rather watch 460 minutes of Kermit, rather than 230 minutes of some computer generated frog-monster!www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When i heard that a Muppet film is going to be released by Disney i would never imagine that it would be so great.I used to watch the Muppet show every morning on television and my favorite is the Christmas version of Scrooge with the Muppets with Michael Caine.Of course i cannot forget Mrs Piggy and Kermit the frog play.Now in the movie there are very good actors.Amy Adams is just amazing.I remembered her for the movie Enchanted very sweet girl and i believe it was the right choice.Jason Segel was also very good although its the first film i see him.Chris cooper is the perfect bad guy for the film and Rashida Jones is the absolute competitive for the business show.Once again many greats for the filmmakers.I hope we can see a sequel soon.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is one of the world's saddest truths that the most precious portions of our lifetimes consist of the vaguely remembered, short-lived moments that make up our carefree childhood. For many, popular culture plays an integral part in this wondrous world of a thousand reminiscences. Particular films, TV shows, songs, poems, books and several other things are firmly attached to these treasured musingsCinema often encapsulates the heartbreak of a good thing that never lasts long enough in the form of stories centring on a young forbidden love or an idolised outlaw who lives in the moment. However, quite rarely do film and television acknowledge their own gifts of laughter, happiness and captivating storytelling without losing their integrity and merely banking on the emotional attachment of a brand name. The Muppets comes as one of the most welcome and pleasurable nostalgia rides in the past decade. It rides the waves of winsome sentimentality with spectacular style where The Smurfs and Alvin and the Chipmunks have been seduced by sirens and smashed themselves into splinters on the rocks. No attempt is made at drastic modernisation for a more ironic and cold- blooded era, their unforgettable cruise through the centuries is simply continued and brought forward a step further, only this time with a few more wistful backward glances that we're more than happy to have.It is a miracle that we are finally spared another disturbing cheap computer-generated clone of a classic character that was designed for one of the many other uniquely wonderful forms of animation. Ardent fans will be relieved to see that all of the lovable Muppet characters ? from the iconic Kermit the Frog to the unintelligible Swedish Chef ? are unchanged and undiminished, thanks to the stunning creative work of several very gifted puppeteers, many of whom originally brought them to life. They are incredibly gifted team headed by Steve Whitmore, Eric Jacobson, Matt Vogel, David Goelz, David Rudman, Tyler Bunch and Bill Baretta, who between them operate and voice over 25 Muppets, and should be mentioned here before the marquee names of the human cast.However, that is not to say that their contribution is redundant and merely obligatory for a Hollywood film that is to have an old-fashioned basis, as declared by money-grubbing producers. The Muppets have always interacted with major celebrities, as seen by the shot of Kermit's wall of honour in his office. The star appearances from people like Julie Andrews, Michael Caine and Billy Connolly just form part of the fun, like the farcical song and dance numbers including less than masterful covers of popular songs. This is also certainly not the first time we've seen the Muppets been placed in an unexpected setting. Over the years they've been strutting their stuff in all sorts of places, such as in classic stories like A Christmas Carol and Treasure Island or with their deliriously funny science fiction outing, Muppets from Space (1999).These little guys are funny, sweet, cute, crass and moving, often within the one show, but, despite their technical brilliance characteristic of the legendary Jim Henson, they have never been "quality", an attribute that should not rightly be considered synonymous with age. This movie is no more a fine piece of filmmaking than anything else they've done, with their usual campiness this time being present in the plot development. The story elements used are a collection of rusty, used parts for which all the wear and tear have rendered their origins completely indiscernible.It begins with an introduction to our fish out of water hero, Walter (voiced by Peter Linz) a puppet who grew up in a human family going goggle-eyed and gluing his eyes to the screen whenever his beloved Muppets were on television, and dreaming of meeting him, a bit like a mixture between Ariel in The Little Mermaid (1989) and Mumble in Happy Feet (2006). When he finally gets a chance to visit the Muppet studios, he finds that the places has become a rundown wreck since the gang became a relic, like Rodney Copperbottom when he visited Bigweld Industries in Robots (2005). The script then makes use of a plot device that's been horrendously overused: a heartless entrepreneur (Chris Cooper) plans to steal the property in order to get to the oil underneath, and he will succeed unless the Muppets can rally together to put on a comeback performance that can raise $10 million. This inspires many moments of pathos as many obstacles are hurled at the lovable bunch of freedom fighters, not so much from the archetypal villain as from the famously fickle nature of the entertainment industry.There is also an engaged couple thrown into the mix who find themselves very inconvenienced by the crisis. The man is Walter's loving and helpful brother Gary (Jason Segel) who is making the lovely Mary (Amy Adams) feel woefully neglected and even doubtful about their union. Their demonstration of the importance of staying true to the one you love is what inspires Kermit and the irrepressible Miss Piggy to patch another of their many breakups. Unfortunately, the presence of the human couple is generally a little jarring on the comic rhythm. Segel is certainly animated, but excessively so to the extent where he seems more at home on Playschool, and could possibly come across as patronising and false to the older children. Still, as usual, the writers are infinitely aware of their own cheesiness and enjoy the occasional bit of self-parody, but, like with the exhausted premise of vampires, jokes about these narrative clichs have now become clichs themselves.Nonetheless, it's a genuinely involving and heart-warming little romp in which the moments of pathos actually produce heartfelt sobs instead of impatient groans.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hooray for The Muppets making their way back to the big screen.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We all have a lot to thank Jason Segel for, and the highest thing on that list is bringing the muppets back into everyone's mind, if it weren't for him I'm sure this movie would have been a dream that never would have come true. We all know those crazy characters called the muppets, and they are just as charming and funny today as they were 20 years ago, and most are all present here in this fun filled family adventure full of songs, laughs and charm.The story is pretty easy, two very big muppets fans and their female companion travel to LA to visit the muppet theatre only to find it dilapidated and crumbling to the ground, it's then that they also realize that an evil oil tycoon is out to destroy all things muppet, so comes all the adventures as they round up the muppet gang in hopes of reviving the clan everyone loves. As I said earlier most of the main muppets are present and accounted for, Kermit, Gonzo, Miss Piggy, Fozzie and the rest however I did notice the absence if Rizzo The Rat, my own personal favourite, but his absence is quickly made up for by joke after joke and laugh after laugh. This is certainly a film that adults will enjoy just as much as kids, if not more, there are lots of adult jokes thrown in for good measure. The only thing I would say I was disappointed with was Amy Adams character, she was so underused, now Amy Adams is amazing, she can sing dance and act the socks off anyone and she was just standing there for most of the film, her character could have been on screen a lot more I think, but the short time she is in it she's great, and Jason Segel is excellent as the lead, as is Sam Cooper as the villain, a great role for him.It's hard not to succumb to all the fun and mayhem that comes along with The Muppets, you'd be a serious grump if you didn't like it, equally as good as The Smurfs and just as much fun. :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Welcome back everyone!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I admit my expectations for The Muppets return to the big screen was pretty huge. These guys were staples of my childhood as they were for many and I want them so badly to be successful again. This film was really well done in a number of ways and yet also didn't quite follow through in a few others. First of all it was brilliantly done that The Muppets comeback film was done with the premise of this being The Muppets comeback show. It sort of broke down that fourth wall and made clear that The Muppets are now washed up and one die hard fan will bring them all back together for an epic show. It was truly a reunion movie and I liked that about it a lot!! I'm not sure any of it was deserving of big screen though because this could have easily been an outstanding reunion TV show or TV movie as well. But that doesn't change the fact that it was great to have The Muppets back. I loved seeing where they all were and how they get them all back together again.One of my issues with The Muppets is Jason Segel. I think he's a talented comedian but he is and always has been primarily a very adult comedian. He co-wrote the script on this and bravo to him for that but I felt like his presence in the film really hurt the final project. As hard as he was trying, and I don't think he meant to, but the entire film it felt like he was mocking the subject matter. It just seemed like he wasn't bringing himself down to the morality that is The Muppets. Amy Adams was decent in her role and she had some good songs in the film but she was almost in the same boat. I just don't think the human characters played by Adams and Segel were necessary at all and it might have been a better film without them. Chris Cooper was a lot of fun as the villain of the film. He manages to be campy and funny without seeming like he's mocking the subject matter but rather being mocked and that's what Muppet villains are all about. The cast of the Muppets are fantastic as always. My only comment to them is that no one will ever play Kermit quite like Jim Henson. I felt like Kermit's heart wasn't 100% in this. I also thought there was so much going on that sometimes we missed out on the heart of what The Muppets used to be.Don't get me wrong for a minute. I loved seeing this and it was great seeing them all again. I just had a lot of expectations and some of them didn't get met which is inevitable. The music for the most part was fantastic (Man vs Muppet was a definitive highlight absolutely) and the cameos were plentiful. If you watched again and again you'd probably catch a few faces you missed the first time and that is something else that makes The Muppets who they are. My final complaint, and once again please don't mistake this for me ragging on the movie because I insist you see it if you're even remotely a fan of The Muppets, but the final show they put on, the classic Muppet Show I thought lacked some pizazz and I would have liked to have seen more of that classic feel to it. The end credits with everyone singing The Muppet song was awesome too. I hope that this is the beginning of a Muppet rebirth because these guys deserve it and this was a good solid start!! 7.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Muppets redux.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There basically was no reason for the Muppets to disappear from the field for as long as they did. They never lost any of their entertainment value or started to become outdated in any way. So I'm glad they are being brought back again, in this, more or less, reboot of the franchise. It introduces the magic and the characters to a new generation and it brings everything back, so many generations grew up with in the past and shall grow up with in the future as well, hopefully.In that regard this movie works on both levels. It's a perfectly fun movie for kids, who aren't familiar yet and a nostalgic trip for those who remember the Muppets from the past.The world seemed ready and desperate for another good Muppet movie again and people seem to be mostly loving this movie because of nostalgic, which however seems to make most people blind of all the problems that this movie still has.This is not the Muppet movie that made me laugh the most. It's also not the one with the best written script, songs or cast in it. Therefore it also isn't my favorite Muppet movie. It's obviously good entertainment and fun all but it's still too weak and flawed of a movie to consider this one of the year's most entertaining ones.I have always really liked the Muppets, all of its many entertaining and very rich characters and their comedy as well but I frankly never have been too impressed with their movies. Most of them are still great fun but they are also quite weak and clumsily ones in some ways as well.The story is really far too simplistic, even for a Muppet movie. This movie was meant to bring the Muppets back again and that's exactly what's happening in the story. The Muppets are reuniting once again to safe their beloved theater from being demolished. The story is the sort of story anyone could had come up with during a first brainstorm session for a new Muppet movie, that was supposed to reunite and reintroduce all of the beloved characters. It never feels like lots of time and effort went into it and the most important thing for the writers was to simply bring the Muppets back again, without having a true original story backing things up.And I don't know what it is but human actors and Muppets don't work out too well together, most of the times. It's as if actors have no idea how to act when doing a scene with a Muppet, so they go for a very safe and childish approach. It's funny, no matter how many great starts you bring in to a Muppet movie, it will still be the Muppets who steal the show and upstage its human cast. And that is also definitely the case with this movie.I don't know why they keep trying but again there are human characters who play an important role for the movie. But really, who goes to see a Muppet movie for Jason Segel or Amy Adams? You could say that this movie has too human characters in it, especially for its first half. I don't want to see humans dancing and singing. I want to see Muppets do that! And when you have an actor like Chris Cooper playing the main villain, you shouldn't waste him in the way like this movie does. He was the only human character I was interesting in seeing more of but he plays a very generic role and is hardly in the movie at all, sadly.And talking about human actors; Muppet movies often had been filled by cameos of well known actors but this movie goes a bit too far. Seriously, some actors make a 3 seconds appearance, that is a totally irrelevant one as well. It seems like this movie is being filled with cameos, just for the sake of it. And I admit, I missed half of the cameos simply because I didn't recognize some people or had no idea who they were in the first place.These are all complaints about this movie, that made me see it as a far from perfect movie, as opposed to most other people, who simply are in love with it. No, I don't really get that but despite all of my complaints I still really liked the movie.It was good, clean, simple, fun and it was great to see the Muppets doing their thing again, like they never had been gone. Most of the big name Muppets appear in this movie, though some people might of course still complain about it that it doesn't feature his or hers favorite Muppet prominently enough. But that's what happens when you have a movie that is supposed to reintroduce ALL of the Muppets to the world again.The Muppets especially get to shine in the final 30 minutes, which is a throwback to the famous "The Muppet Show", that aired from 1976 till 1981 and has aired for many years after that as well, in many different countries. It was the part of the movie that I truly liked and enjoyed watching and it made me wish the rest of the movie was more like that. But who knows. This movie has pretty much setup the Muppet franchise again and probably a lot more movies will spawn from it, in which the Muppets don't need to get reintroduced again and they can do their thing, from the start on, without the interference of too many human characters hopefully. Oh and with some better songs as well please.Most people will mostly love it for nostalgic reasons and those unfamiliar with the Muppets will like it for its charm, comedy and just overall entertainment value.7/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Muppets are BACK!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The gang is back! And thank God for that! As I walked into the theatre I got such a sense of enormous joy and excitement to see what the Muppets can bring, after a nearly ten year absence from pop culture altogether. They've always been there, distilled in numerous films, television shows, and random videos but never were given the chance for a true comeback. I was extremely happy to find out that they did not disappoint. Walter, a Muppet-obsessed Muppet, is dying to visit the old Muppet studios, and finally gets his chance when his best friend Gary (writer Jason Segel) and his girlfriend Mary (a delightful Amy Adams) vacation to Los Angeles. They finally meet Kermit, to Walter's shock, who tells them that the entire Muppet studios is being renovated...but what Kermit doesn't know is that Tex Richman, a meta-name if there ever is one, is planning on tearing down the studios to drill for oil. Unless Kermit and the classic Muppet gang, who have long separated and moved on since their days together, can come up with 1 million dollars, they will lose their beloved studio. So what else to do than put on a show?! The new venture isn't perfect. There needs to be more Muppets...many of the sequences and musical numbers are hardly performed by the crew that the film is titled after! Other problems consist of a lack true Muppet heart...the film feels all too much like a fun nostalgia trip, than a new addition to the Muppets canon. Some characters have been reduced: Rowlfe barely has a personality at all, while Rizzo is there in merely passing glances. But it does a whole lot of things right. It has the zany, cooky energy that the Muppets have lost and an endearing quality is back that has been missing since Jim Henson's death. The simple nature, the meta-awareness, and this film finally brings back the great comedy that the Muppets are capable of. The songs, though short and often forgettable, express a lightheartedness and Amy Adams is just the kind of celebrity who would be a guest host, if the Muppet show were around today. She proves herself Muppet worth in this film for sure, though her character gets shifted at times due to the films lack of focus. To me, this film is great but could have been more, and maybe that's just what will happen. The nostalgia is only nostalgia for those who knew the Muppets, but kids today have no idea who these felt creatures are! As an introduction, the film is lovely. It's heartwarming, and may create a few tears for true Muppet fans...when Kermit begins to sing "The Rainbow Connection," it is a reminder of what the Muppets have always been about: suspending disbelief and keeping the dream alive. They've infiltrated the hearts of America almost like no other since their inception, and judging by the box office reports, I don't think we've seen the last of them. It may not fully capture all the magic of the Muppets in their golden age, but The Muppets a brilliant, hilarious, and positively gleeful time to be shared, and certainly a promise of the greatness to come.

		<shortDescription>Rather underwhelming</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Muppet Show, The Muppet Movie and The Great Muppet Caper are classics, Muppet Christmas Carol, Muppet Treasure Island and Muppets Take Manhatten are great, Muppets from Space was okay but disappointing compared to what came before it, It's a Very Muppet Christmas Movie and Letters from Santa were mediocre and Muppet Wizard of Oz was terrible. So as a fan of the Muppets of course I'd see this movie, and it was one of my most anticipated movies of the year. Sadly, it turned out to be one of my most disappointing. It does have good things. The movie does look good, it is well shot and with colourful scenery. The first 10 minutes were very moving, at this point I thought to myself now this is going to be a good movie with lots of heart. Walter was generally endearing for all his character flaws, allowing for some very sweet and heartfelt moments, and Chris Cooper was a funny and suitably nasty Scrooge-like villain, though the maniacal laughter was overdone. Animal had some funny moments, like with Jack Black, and two songs are good, if not on the same level as Rainbow Connection, First Time it Happens or Professional Pirate. Life is a Happy Song put a smile on my face and is very catchy and Man or Muppet was really quite poignant. The use of Rainbow Connection was also delightful, for a movie that felt too much like a Jason Segal vehicle it was lovely to have something to connect us to the Muppets we know and love.There are unfortunately too many things wrong with The Muppets(2011).The rest of the songs, one would argue that there are too many for a start, are forgettable and have no energy, Me Party and Cooper's rap song were just cheesy and just weren't needed. The writing was disappointingly lazy, the satire was not sharp or witty enough and a lot of it was too cynical and immature, the fart shoes were embarrassingly unfunny especially. The story had great potential as seen with the first 10 minutes. But is let down by a soppy underdeveloped love story between Segal and Adams, draggy pacing and the fact that it seemingly wasn't sure whether it was aiming at adults reminiscing over their childhood and nostalgia or at children newly-introduced to the Muppets. The Muppets(2011) is further let down by too many humans, not enough Muppets, I wouldn't mind if the characters were interesting but everybody including the Muppets seemed flat. Amy Adams' character was severely underwritten, Jason Segal's is annoying, Miss Piggy was the least funny she's been and Kermit is dull as dishwater. Animal is the only one who's at least amusing. Even the acting was lacklustre, the celebrity cameos, except for Jack Black and Jim Parssons, were come-and-go quality with seemingly no reason for being there, Amy Adams tries to do something with her underwritten character and ends up mugging it while Jason Segal's performance is awkward and over-compensated. Some of the Muppet voices seemed off too, especially with Fozzie, who almost sounds like a woman which was somewhat weird-sounding.All in all, has good things but underwhelming. 5/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Attack of the clones: It's the Muppets without The Muppets</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A terrible film.What set out to be a loving tribute to the original Henson Muppets has resulted in one of the worst kind of tributes imaginable: a highly sanatised Disney version in which little of the underlying adult humour and improvisation that made The Muppets what they were.Why subtitle Camilla and the Swedish Chef? While there are practical Muppet effects, there are still considerable VFX enhancements (arm rod removal, puppeteer removal, etc) - something that Jim Henson would have never had sanctioned - he believed in doing everything as practical as possible. Like a theatre performance. Yet he was a great advocate of technology - of which can be seen through the work of the Creature Shop in both animatronics and CG real-time performance. Some of the smallest things that made The Muppets, like the arm rods, the occasional glimpse of a puppeteer trying to hide of shot - were all part of the charm.The fact that Frank Oz was unhappy enough not to work with Disney and the team, and that Steve Whitmere was threatening to have his name taken off the credits over potential plot issues, and that Kevin Clash didn't want to participate and that the CTW refused to license Elmo to Disney, speaks volumes about how Disney is treating The Muppets in the modern era.Henson themselves have little involvement - the puppets are made by a third party company - the Muppet Man is a creation of another third party FX shop - the VFX folk have no connection with Henson. But the Muppet costumes are bizarrely enough fabricated by Jim Henson's Creature Shop.It's a nice try, but neither Jason Segel and Nicholas Stoller - who have generally up to this point been involved in somewhat formulaic Hollywood comedies - are no Jerry Juhls, Jack Burns, Frank Ozes or Jim Hensons. The writers that gave us The Muppets that we used to know.That said - the current generation kids will probably love this movie, the older generation may think they love it, but when you sit down and watch the original Muppet Show and Muppet movies - you'll see there is a very big difference in style, structure and technique.The Muppets are dead. Long live The Muppets.</fullReview>

But this isn't quite what Mary had in mind. Will they be successful? Will they avoid Richman's nefarious schemes? Will Gary and Mary's relationship survive? And will anyone notice that, while Gary is human, Walter is a Muppet? Jason Segel (who plays Gary) is one of the prime movers behind this Muppet renaissance movie, and one thing which screams from every frame of this movie is how much he loves the classic Muppets TV series. I must say when the show opening started, on a big wide screen and in surround sound, I choked up a bit. The main human performers - Segel, Amy Adams as Mary, and Chris Cooper as bwah-hah-hahing villain Richman - all do well.The story is simple but full, with plenty of room for nonsense, bits of business, and countless homages to the past. It would be wrong, I think to approach a review in too much depth. Let me just say that it pleased me, it is likely to please most of those who remember the TV series fondly, but it has enough in it to reach and please a new audience.My only reservation echoes something commented on widely - they need to get a better Fozzie bear voice.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A magical experience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Muppets have been an important part of my life. Their "golden age" is identified to the '70s (when the successful TV programme The Muppets Show was transmitted), and even though I hugely enjoyed that period of the characters, I think I enjoyed them even more during the '80s, when the TV ecosystem was still flexible enough to hold such unpredictable and experimental series as Storyteller, Dog City and The Jim Henson Hour. However, two tragedies came during the '90s...Jim Henson (1936-1990)'s death and the subsequent acquisition of the Muppets by the emporium Disney. Since then, we had only seen them in some mediocre movies (such as Muppets from Space and Muppet Treasure Island) and TV specials (such as It's a Very Muppet Christmas Movie) in which Henson's "voice" was completely absent (literal and figuratively). In summary, it seemed that the spirit from the Muppets had been diluted by the corporative influence from their new owners.Fortunately, co-screenwriters Jason Segel and Nicholas Stoller, along with director James Bobin, could reunite enough influence in order to create a new film, simply titled The Muppets, with the objective of resurrecting the characters, introducing them to a new generation and bringing their original sense of humor back. And it is a pleasure for me to say that The Muppets could perfectly achieve everything it proposed to itself, and it left me wanting to see them more frequently, as long as this same level of energy, humor and "muppetosity" can be kept.The screenplay from The Muppets is hugely entertaining and very funny. Besides, the classic concept of "let's save the theater" works perfectly in order to motivate the characters, create drama and keep us in suspense till the end. On some way, I missed some original voices (unfortunately, Frank Oz refused to participate in this movie, and some of the classic performers, such as Richard Hunt, are currently retired), but the puppeteers who replaced them show a lot of "spark" and enthusiasm. What is more, there are various musical numbers in this film, and they are amazingly an integral part of the narrative.In conclusion, The Muppets made me laugh, made me cry, and resurrected my taste in Henson's legacy, which is in good hands for the first time in many years. Personal anecdote: before the movie started, I saw the trailers of family films which are soon to be released. They were animated by computer, they looked identical, and they sold the same rancid humor, the same pre-fabricated characters and the same frantic action in order to distract the children. On the opposite, The Muppets does not have too much action, it has minimum special effects, and its characters possess much more life and personality than any digital creation. Its sense of humor is intelligent and does not insult the spectator, the emotional moments feel honest, and it is definitely the best comedy I have seen in various years. In summary, a magical and completely unforgettable film experience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Nostalgia's a big thing these days. In a cinematic climate scared of taking risks, old TV shows, video games and books are given a revamp. With this is mind, it was perhaps inevitable that The Muppets would make a comeback. While they haven't completely gone away, a slew of kid-friendly straight-to-DVD films (after a brief return to TV in the mid-90s) have seen them slip from the public eye. Fortunately, this new film isn't a cynical reboot or pointless nostalgia trip. With 'How I Met Your Mother' actor (and unabashed Muppet fan) Jason Segel writing and starring, 'The Muppets' is in safe hands.The plot is fairly basic: Gary (Segel), his long-term girlfriend Mary (Amy Adams) and Gary's Muppet 'brother' Walter take a trip to the Muppet Studios (after a touching flashback which shows the strong lifelong bond between Gary and Walter and Walter's love for the Muppets). After eavesdropping on Tex Richman (Chris Cooper, enjoying himself as the typical maniacal villain) planning to take over Muppet Studios and dig for oil, they decide to find Kermit and convince him to put on a telethon to raise $10 million and save the studio.For even the most cynical viewer, this film is a joy to watch. This movie has something for everyone: there are numerous references to the original series and previous movies, some upbeat song-and-dance routines (which stay true to the original show's vaudeville origins), clever breaking-the-fourth-wall moments (when Kermit first refuses to get the gang back together, Mary quips, 'It's going to be a short movie') lots of celebrity cameos and plenty of humour. Yes, the film has the usual messages of believing in yourself and trying hard to succeed, but it doesn't descend into mawkishness.The usual gang are present: Kermit, Miss Piggy, Fozzy (who is still the unfunniest funny bear around), Animal, Scooter, Gonzo, The Swedish Chef (who has a bigger role in this film than in most of the previous films combined, including a brief homage to 'Scarface'), Sam the Eagle etc. There's even a new character: Eighties Robot, who is Kermit's butler and driver.There's a wonderful sense of fantasy in this film: never once is the logic of how Gary could have a Muppet brother questioned and the cast breaks into song at a moments notice, even Richman has an impromptu rap number. The most stunning example of this is during Kermit's first song in his mansion. As he walks past the old photos of the Muppets, they come to life and sing with him, even The Swedish Chef is involved (subtitled of course).It's hard to find anything to dislike about The Muppets. It has a sense of magic and wonder which is complemented with plenty of clever, refreshingly innocent humour. It's the epitome of the perfect family film, satisfying both the nostalgic adult and wide-eyed child. If anything, it proves that while they may have been briefly forgotten, The Muppets have never stopped being loved. With a bit of luck, it may even encourage a new generation to explore The Muppets for the first time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Most entertaining film I've seen at the movies for ages ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just got done reading the "hated it" reviews of The Muppets and not one of them really explains why the nay-sayers hated it other than it wasn't true to their childhood memory of growing up with The Muppet Show. My own experience of growing up with the muppets was less than satisfying. Sure I loved them, but they were screened on Sunday night and as soon as the show was over I had to go to bed. So for me the muppets symbolised the end of the weekend and having to go to bed only to wake up to yet another week of getting bullied at school. This movie makes up for a lot of that!!! From the moment The Muppets started, my friend and I were laughing appreciatively, as was everyone in the session I attended. But when the muppet telethon started, the laughs went into hyperdrive and I found myself barely able to breath from laughing so hard. It was also great to see Jack Black actually being funny again, after a run of tepid, unfunny "comedies." Black plays the perfect fall guy and actually adds to the hysteria. The whole thing is so masterfully executed. Then when Kermit comes out and reprises the song he is most famous for, my eyes welled, especially when he was joined by Miss Piggie and the rest of the cast. I'd forgotten that the muppets do sincerity and poignancy as effortlessly as they do their laughs. A few criticisms. I noticed there were lots of kids in my session and most of them were pretty wriggly while the adults laughed like mad. I don't think Disney has been able to cater for all tastes with this film. There are too many "talking head" moments to generally keep kids engaged and they are too young to understand what nostalgia is, which is heavily emphasised in the film. I loved all the songs but during dance sequences the actors kept addressing the camera and then vaguely looking off into the middle distance which became rather jarring. I don't mind actors breaking the fourth wall and directly addressing the camera, but it needs to be done with conviction and purpose, both of which seemed missing here and it kept pulling me out of the filmic experience (I may be quite alone here). I also didn't like seeing Disney unashamedly plugging Cars 2 in one scene near the end of the film. It was a shameless piece of cross-promotion. Having said this, I really loved the Toy Story short at the start of the film - fast paced and full of ingeniously hilarious toys.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Touching, funny, clever--- everything you love about the Muppets</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As of writing, The Muppets is the third highest-grossing film of the Muppet franchise when adjusted for inflation. Since its release in late November, its comedy and sentiment have gained approval from critics and audiences, many proclaiming it's up there with the first two Muppet movies and fewer claiming its even better. Hell, some even say it's one of the best films of the year. Does it hold up to the hype? For the most part, yes.Kermit lives alone in a mansion until he's visited by a trio of Muppet fans: Walter (who's actually a Muppet himself, voiced by Peter Linz), his human brother Gary (Jason Segel), and Gary's fianc, Mary (Amy Adams). They tell him the run-down Muppet Theater is about to be bought and torn down by oil tycoon, Tex Richman (Chris Cooper). The only way to save it is to reunite the gang to put on another show in order to raise enough money to buy the theater back. It won't be easy, however, as the Muppets have been all but forgotten by the public.The story feels almost like a direct sequel to the first film in the franchise, The Muppet Movie, sharing the themes of following your dreams, making it in the entertainment world, and the importance of friendship. However, whereas the first film was about Kermit and friends trying to break into show business, this one's about them trying to re-enter it, as they've all become virtually unknown after years of inactivity and being split up. As a result, they have a hard time finding a station to broadcast their show and a guest star to draw in viewers (they manage to snag Jack Black, however, in one of the funniest scenes of the movie). While I still think the original film is better, The Muppets comes really close to that level of quality and the two movies compliment each other well.If I made the film sound like it's all sentiment, never fear, as it contains the same wonderful Muppets-style humor: lots of fourth wall breaking and clever jokes everyone can enjoy. The music numbers are great, in particular the first song, which features excellent choreography. And of course there's the classic 'Rainbow Connection', which had everyone reaching for their tissues.As good as it is, there are still some problems, mostly minor and nitpicky stuff. The Gary and Mary characters felt a little superfluous, their romantic subplot in particular, but Segel and Adams are both very charming and funny in their roles, so it doesn't detract that much from the plot. Walter is somewhat bland, though this isn't a large detriment either as once Kermit makes his appearance, the story puts more focus on him and the Muppets. The biggest problem I had was the clumsy handling of the ending, but once again, it doesn't take away so much that it kills the entire movie.If you love the Muppet Show and the old Muppet movies, then you will really enjoy this. While the few flaws it does have keep it from being a great movie, it retains all the humor and heart you could ever want from the Muppets. May they have more feature-length ventures in the future.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great comeback for one of the best children shows ever made!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Muppets have been and always will be amazing. Take this film as a prime example.The movie opens to the life of Walter (Linz), a Muppet, and Gary (Segel), his human brother. As they grow up, they develop a love for The Muppet Show. Eventually they end up going to LA with Mary (Adams), Gary's girlfriend and taking a tour at the Muppets studio, where Walter discovers an oil tycoon's (Cooper) plan to destroy the theatre and drill it. He, Gary, and Mary, decide to visit Kermit and convince the Muppets to get back together for one last show to save the theatre.This film also has short appearances with Jack Black (The School of Rock) and Jim Parsons (The Big Bang Theory).This movie has many of the elements that just scream, "Oh my gosh! It's The Muppets!". Which include covers of popular songs, and explosions. Even the original characters still have the same physical and personality traits, as they did from the start of the very first episode of this show, to the end of the film. They also were able to incorporate every character from the show into this film. The acting is very interesting, as the characters in the movie pretend that The Muppets are no longer popular, when the franchise is still a huge part of pop-culture. They even act as though Kermit never existed, when everyone in reality knows who he is. This could probably happen two hundred years later in the future, but not now.The actors make you think that they believe the Muppets are actual real-life beings that can communicate, and think the way they always have.This flick will be thoroughly enjoyed by many kinds of people including, hardcore fans and young children who endlessly beg their parents to see this movie at their local theatre. Seeing as it has a mixture of comedy, drama, and catchy music scores. It is one of those movies where you go into the theatre thinking, "Alright, there is probably nothing special about this film," and come out singing one of their songs as they leave after the credits appear.I give this movie a 9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The movie that proves dreams can come true</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's been years since the Muppets were on the air and its fuzzy stars have gone their separate ways. But when an evil tycoon conspires to tear down the dilapidated Muppet Theatre, the stars are reunited by fanatical new Muppet Walter, who is visiting L.A. with his brother Gary and Gary's girlfriend, Mary, who only wants to spend her anniversary with her boyfriend.This movie is the sort of thing that never happens. It's clear that living and working with the Muppets was a huge childhood fantasy of star/co-writer Jason Segel, who struts through the film with a big, stupid grin on his face. And he has reason to be grinning, he accomplished something that nobody else has been able to do in 20 years: he brought the Muppets back into the public consciousness in a big way whilst retaining all the hallmarks that made them a phenomenon in the '70s and '80s. The film has gratuitous celebrity cameos, '80s references, self-references, inside jokes and general absurdity galore, moments that tug at your heartstrings, two levels of humor (for adults and kids), and a ton of catchy (and vastly diverse) songs.That's not to say it's a perfect movie (and realistically a few Muppet films come close but not a single one is a masterpiece). This film's greatest asset is simultaneously its greatest flaw: Segel, whom admittedly gives a pitch-perfect performance as the happy-go-lucky idiot who realizes it's time to grow up. The problem is this story is a little too big and takes time away from the Muppets themselves, though Segel mostly takes a backseat (literally) to his fuzzy costars about 20 minutes in. Knowing how big of a fan he is -- it was Segel who conceived the movie and pushed to get it made -- it makes this flaw not only forgivable but downright endearing. He's a 30-something kid playing with all of his childhood TV friends.As promotion, the Muppets invaded the small-screen, appearing on "Dancing with the Stars," "WWE," "Good Morning America," the CMA Awards, "The X Factor," Jimmy Fallon, Jimmy Kimmel, Jay Leno, Regis and Kelly, and even "Saturday Night Live," on which they were featured during the first season (they left SNL for their own variety show). It's been decades since the Muppets have had that sort of exposure and, while it remains to be seen if it will endure, it's incredible that this massive-scale revival only happened because one little boy loved the Muppets.The message of both this and the original film is that dreams can come true, and Jason Segel proved it can happen. Pretty inspiring and for that reason alone there's no question that Jim Henson would be proud.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Muppet return for all-ages</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As I have said many times before, when reviewing a family movie, I look at it from a variety of perspectives; first, is it appropriate for my three kids? Second, are I and my kids being entertained? And finally, is there a decent storyline? The Muppets stars Jason Segel, co-star of Forgetting Sarah Marshall and the hit T.V. Series How I Met Your Mother. Segal, a long time fan that had grown up watching The Muppets, only to see them face into obscurity, co-wrote the screenplay for the film. I applaud him for his genuine love of the characters and the care he took in bringing them into the present. The Muppets is a truly entertaining movie! I'm glad that I had an opportunity to take my kids to see something that I had grown up on and how enjoyable it was to me. As I go on a tangent, without spoiling the movie; The Muppets popularity shrunk as animation grew and the human element of children's entertainment was lost. If you are looking for CGI and crazy animation this isn't the movie for you or your children. If you are looking for a movie that won't over stimulate for your kids and is easy enough for them to understand, than this is the movie to take them.What stands out most about The Muppets is that the movie embraces what the Muppets were and what their current perception is; and again for that I applaud them. As you watch the film it is very clear that this is the message that is the underlying theme of the film. This film is funny and touching in true Muppet form, all of the characters are touched upon and the movie flows well with a great deal of cameos. It is long enough that my 6 year old wasn't antsy and my 10 year old understood it and laughed along without thinking it was a baby movie.I am glad that the Muppets are back and I wouldn't be surprised if there is another one made soon. To me if you loved the Muppets as a kid this is a must see.

		<fullReview>The promos were looking great, so naturally, I expected a great movie but it was disappointing and frustrating. The film actually started out great, hoping that the Muppets will reunite but as the time went by, this movie turned into a mess. Remember the nostalgic "guest stars" that used to perform as characters in the show? Well, no more. The new Muppet movie is just a list of celebrity names, such as Whoopi Goldberg, Selena Gomez, Zach Galifianakis and Sarah Silverman, but all of them are just flashing faces. Meanwhile, the Muppets are completely reduced to background scenery and aren't given anything much to do (so unfaithful to the old times where the human actors were supporting players).I have been a huge fan of the Muppets since I was a little child, so I really wanted to like this movie, but I can't.</fullReview>

The same type of cartoon violence(very, very mild. Nothing more than cartoon like explosions!)used in the original Muppets applied to this movie and is quite entertaining. This movie was amazingly spectacular with all of the guest stars, including Selena Gomez, Sarah Silverman, Rico Rodriguez, and more. It is truly a masterpiece and may be remembered as the "greatest Muppet movie ever".It may be a Disney movie, but for the kid inside of us all, that kid should be wanting to watch The Muppets. If you are ready for laughs, cameo performances, and singing along to your favorite songs from this movie, it's time to go watch it. NOW.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>For the lovers and dreamers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As any film critic and movie-goer will tell you, 2011 is the Year of Nostalgia. It's impossible to explain this phenomenon ? maybe it's the result of the public's collective need to escape from the grimness of reality or maybe it's the upshot of aging film-makers struck by the urge to reflect upon their lives and careers or maybe it's simply a coincidence ? yet in the end, it hardly matters. The fact is, several movies this year express a yearning for the past, either directly (Super 8, Hugo, The Artist) or obliquely (Crazy, Stupid, Love, Moneyball, We Bought a Zoo). Of those in the latter category, The Muppets is most successful at transporting viewers to a bygone era, a supposedly happier time, more rational in which dreams came true if you believed in yourself, and good inevitably triumphed over evil. It's Singin' in the Rain meets Toy Story 3: a delightful ode to the power of friendship, the strength of the human spirit and the joy of childhood that's bound to charm the most steadfast cynic.The movie opens with a montage showing the two main characters, Gerry and his brother Walter, growing up, a five-minute scene that sets the tone for the rest of the movie. Like Toy Story 3, which featured a similar sequence during its opening credits, The Muppets is a "kids'" movie that appeals just as much, if not more, to adults and, despite being an ostensible comedy, aims more for the heart than the funny bone. It has its share of gags and jokes, yet what ultimately makes the film special is its ability to blend off-the-walls elation with wistful melancholy, to advocate traditional values in a fresh, inspired way and to evoke memories of the past without coming off as resentful or condescending. Although each scene bursts with manic energy, beneath all that can-do spirit and gleeful fluff, the movie is bittersweet; it's not simply an attempt to introduce a beloved host of characters to a media-savvy generation but a tender elegy to the lost innocence of youth. In its own uplifting way, The Muppets insists that the past is still relevant and always will be, no matter how far away it seems.Of course, The Muppets also works as pure spectacle. The cast is huge, thanks to numerous cameos, including Neil Patrick Harris and Emily Blunt (in a clever wink at her work in 2005's The Devil Wears Prada). It is a credit to the tact of the film-makers that none of the cameos distracts from the storyline or the central actors, who fulfill their parts with aplomb. As the lead, Jason Segel radiates verve and sincerity, his well-documented fondness for Jim Henson's felt creations palpable. He makes an endearing couple with Amy Adams, who, after The Fighter, returns to the cheery persona that made her famous, though here, it's more effective than in movies like Doubt and Enchanted. Also impressive is Chris Cooper, who makes the villainous Tex Richman both legitimately menacing and appropriately cartoonish. However, the real stars are the Muppets themselves. The whole gang is back, engaging in their usual lovable antics, and there is something heartwarming about the sight of old-fashioned, tangible puppets in an era of digital animation. At the forefront is Kermit the Frog, as earnest as ever, and feminist diva Miss Piggy, and their romance is so surprisingly heartfelt that it's easy to forget that they're not human. The whole thing brims with infectious energy, complete with musical numbers that represent some of the catchiest tunes since Disney's 1990s heyday (standouts include the joyous "Life's a Happy Song" and a triumphant rendition of the classic "The Rainbow Connection"). It hardly matters that the plot itself is as frothy and predictable as that of a traditional TV sitcom.The day after seeing The Muppets, I came across an article on The A.V. Club that I found uncannily resonant, even though it was actually a review of the latest episode of NBC's wry, pop culture-obsessed show Community. In it, author Todd VanDerWerff asserted that the episode, a Christmas special that parodied Fox's hot-button musical-comedy Glee, reminded him of one thing: that, to quote directly, "liking things is vital". In a way, that could be the message of this film year. As reflected in the Best Picture wins of such films as No Country for Old Men and The Hurt Locker, recent cinema is dominated by cynicism, a sense that the best movies are ones that reveal some fundamental truth behind the chaos of reality. In contrast, this year's most popular movies and prime Oscar contenders, including silent-film homage The Artist and Steven Spielberg's weepie War Horse, are saturated with optimism. Predictably, this trend has drawn complaints from critics who bemoan the attention given to the aforementioned films instead of darker offerings like Martha Marcy May Marlene and Melancholia, essentially equating lighthearted romanticism with escapist fluff. This is where I finally arrive at my point: while I understand the need for grittier, more somber fare, it's a mistake to assume that pessimism is the same as seriousness or that optimism is the same as naivet. Maybe I'm just a sentimental person, but to me, this shift in attitude is a breath of fresh air. This year has given me some of the most eye-opening and downright magical film experiences I've had in a while in Super 8, Moneyball and Hugo, all of which favor emotional catharsis over "realism". The Muppets may not be on the same level as those, but it exemplifies an idea extremely relevant to our perpetually ironic, postmodern climate: it is okay to feel good. It is okay to indulge in nostalgia or yield to emotion. Sometimes, you have to stop analyzing everything and learn to let go. Cynics had their turn, and chances are, this is nothing more than a fleeting anomaly. For now, though, let us dreamers have our moment in the sun, just for one year.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was looking forward to watching this film having been a fan of the Muppets for a long time. This film had few laughs, dragged on for too long and had far too many all human scenes. The songs were lame. The Muppets were just in the background in this movie. I didn't care for any of the human acting and the writing was poor. I'm amazed at the scores and reviews on IMDb. I just don't understand why people think this was such a good movie. Kids will get really bored with this one and most adults will too.I did read that Frank Oz did not agree with the script and did not work on this movie. I can see why now and wish Disney had let him do the movie the way he wanted.Don't waste your money at the theater with this movie. It is at best a DVD rental at a discount price.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Did I have a grin on my face throughout the entirety of The Muppets? Yes, I did. Did I nearly cry at times? Yes, I did. Is The Muppets worth your time? Yes, it is.The Muppets is a classic getting the gang back together story told via the point of view of Walter - the Muppets' biggest fan - who after over-hearing an oil tycoon's plan to tear the old Muppet Studios down to drill oil, appeals to Kermit and the gang to put on one last show and prove the world hasn't forgotten them. Does the basic concept feel formulaic? Yes, but screenwriters Jason Segel and Nicholas Stoller keep the flick from having a predictable ending, a true feat when dealing with such a standard Hollywood story.Kermit and the gang have never been funnier, with great new additions like '80s Robot as Kermit's butler, and as usual, Fozzie the Bear is my personal favorite (plus, who doesn't want to travel by map now). However, it is Kermit who carries the emotional weight of the film on his back. How does one apologize to old friends for not staying in touch with them? How do they reforge a broken relationship? These are real human themes that Segel and Stoller chose to deal with here, and director James Bobin manages to somehow make it work within the world of puppetry, where their eyes never blink! While the script juggles around a few too many characters and plot lines, where near the end certain moments lack tension because the story is constantly shifting from character to character to keep their plot lines going, The Muppets manages to keep the train on the track and arrive at the station on time. Ultimately, the emotion always comes through, with great aid from the fantastic songs, in particular "Pictures in my Head" and "Man or Muppet." I give The Muppets an 8 out of 10!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's time to meet the Muppets</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you haven't already that is of course. And while I tried to tell myself that I didn't like the movie, it just is impossible not to like it (at least for me). It really is sweet and innocent (compared to other movies trying to reach mature audiences with some weird adult jokes), but still has a lot going for itself.The success at the Box Office showed that there is an audience for the Muppets. It also seems that a second movie has been green-lit. It'd be great if Jason Segal would again take over the scripting duty (even if it doesn't look like it right now). Even character turns do not feel as bad as in other movies. Those last minute I'm gonna change who I am and be another "character" are tricky. Yes those are puppets and yes it's not for everyone. But if you let yourself into this world, you will be entertained!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am one of those people who are not really into or aware of the work by Jim Henson's apprentices and i have really heard many things but i was not up for this movie in any way but it was on TV on our local cable channel and i was waiting for something so i thought okay i will watch a movie based on The Muppets. but it only disappointed me and nothing else. i know it was a first attempt like this by Jason Segel since all i know about him is his Comedy movies specially that awful The Good Humor Man that everyone was talking about. This is a Indie low budget puppet movie that never acts as humor or thriller or even drama and gets stuck in middle of them all creating a movie that seems like a experiment gone wrong.I don't know what to say about this movie, it never acts as humour or drama as i said and slowly gets stumbling down under its own weight. this movie is a complete bore with just talking and things that repels one from enjoying or experiencing a low budget horror movie. this movie never gets what it really wants to. There were some critics impressed by this movie? i don't know why what was the point of this movie i don't understand. it is very offending as they show this very Psycho minded oilman wants to drill under the muppet theater for oil having his own really violent and outrageous beliefs and ways of acting on certain people of the society and then punishing them. i am sorry but i just don't know what to say about this movie. this is a bad movie with nothing much to it that will really bore the hell out of you and will not prove anything rather than poking fun at everyone. it acts as a film but never reaches that place. Performances however was impressive by Sgt. Floyd Pepper and as usual what i always think about Sgt. Floyd Pepper, he overacts a lot and throughout. he impressed me in Muppet Treasure Island but more or less he overacts very much. watch it if you are a fan of Henson's minions or want to poke fun at a badly made movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>True to the original Muppets and LOTS of fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Muppets have been broken up for years and have gone in their separate directions. Then it becomes known that an evil oil tycoon (Chris Cooper) is planning to buy the run down Muppets theatre, tear it down and drill for oil underneath it. The Muppets all decide to hold a telethon and make enough money to stop him from buying it.This movie has been a modest hit at the box office and that's good to see. Walt Disney bought the Muppets years ago and I expected the worst. It's good to see that they stayed true to the spirit of the Muppets (VERY family friendly) and also (gently) poke fun at them too. The movie is full of non-stop pop culture references and clever jokes (LOVE the joke that follows Amy Adams looking into a thesaurus) and is constantly breaking down the 4th wall and addressing the audience. Not all the jokes work but, when they do, they're GREAT! The biggest laugh from my audience was when the Muppets kidnap Jack Black and Kermit's reaction:) There are also quite a few songs spread out but they're VERY short and pleasant but instantly forgettable. Adams stops the show with her brief number in a diner.As for the acting...the Muppets are just like you remember them. There are different people voicing them (of course) but they match the old voices perfectly. There are also a lot of guest stars popping up in small roles. Sarah Silvermans made me laugh out loud and Neil Patrick Harris had the best line in the movie. Also I don't like Jack Black at all but I had to admit he was fun here. Segel and Adams play two of the main characters and they work. Segel has a tendency to REALLY overact but Adams is very good which is surprising considering the poor woman has NOTHING to work with! Cooper has fun playing a slimy villain. Also Rashida Jones is amusing playing a TV network executive.The original men who voiced the Muppets complained that this movie was not true to the original Muppets but this is TOTALLY untrue. It matches the original Muppet Show and is always entertaining. The only thing I missed was Animal chasing a full grown woman around yelling, "Woman, woman, woman". But this was fun and entertaining and perfect for the entire family. The kids in my audience were either dead quiet (because they were into the movie) or roaring with laughter! Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I read that Frank Oz didn't do any voice for this film... It didn't matter, and I didn't notice. It was wonderful. I was truly blown away by how cleverly written this story was. If there is any method to bringing back a "dead" franchise, this is the way to do it. Countless other franchises have tried (Transformers) and only succeeded to an extent. (What Michael Bay? Your characters need... character?)This movie is done so well, and although my knowledge of the Muppets was limited to time spent with them in the Muppets Christmas Carol, and Muppet Treasure Island, I felt like I connected back with the old days of the Muppet Show... Days that I hadn't even experienced before!I'll warn you though, this movie is so corny... But it's about old talking puppets, so it easily gets away with it. I was slightly worried in the beginning, but after about 15 minutes, I knew I was set for a great film. The leading roles definitely play supporting roles, if that makes any sense. It is a film about the muppets, so about the muppets it stayed, and there was no better way to do it. The new Muppet, Walter is just as lovable as the rest, and rest assured, you will leave this film quoting it and laughing about it with your friends or family. It's really a fun romp through the past, so find two hours in your life to go enjoy this film. It's really great!Don't let any Muppet haters tell you otherwise... They have no souls.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Sock Puppets Are Back!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me tell you about Bandwagon Bob. Prior to me seeing The Muppets, he went on a rampage about how The Muppets sucked and how it was a musical like Grease. Obviously he hasn't seen a Muppets movie, and what The Muppets had always excelled at was their songs. This new Muppet movie is no exception.The movie mostly centers around a new addition to the Muppet crew, Walter. All of Walter's life he wanted to be a part of the other Muppet crew with Kermit the Frog and all of them ever since he first watched The Muppet Show (something I fondly remember watching with my family back in the eighties). One day, Walter is invited by his caretakers (Jason Segel and the gorgeous Amy Adams) to California to see the studio where they filmed The Muppet Show, well, Walter is ecstatic. They even sing about it! But then things take a turn for the worst when The Muppets' old studio is threatened to be taken over by a ruthless business tycoon (Chris Cooper) and must raise ten million dollars at a telethon to win it back. Reminds me of that Weird Al Yankovich movie UHF.Throughout the way, the film is riddled with great songs and very funny scenes. The film isn't shy about breaking the fourth wall. The best moments for me is towards the end where nostalgia sets in with The Muppet Show. I swear I had chills. Also, I love the chemistry between Jason Segel and Amy Adams. After getting to California, they clearly don't have much purpose left in the film, but their chemistry is so good that it doesn't even matter.The only faults I found was that the story seemed a little rushed, and the forced happy ending somewhat ticked me off. I don't want to give anything away, but the forced resolution with a newspaper clipping wasn't necessary. It was fine the way it was.However, The Muppets are back (hopefully the box office allows it) and I couldn't be happier. Bandwagon Bob was wrong. The Muppets ruled!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Very disappointing. I'm a big Muppets fan. This cheap film doesn't compare in any way to The Muppet Movie.I have literally almost nothing positive about The Muppets. A couple of jokes made me chuckle. The two lead human actors are just annoying, and "Walter" the confused muppet is just plain and boring. The choreographed dance scenes are very bad and don't really belong in a a Muppet movie anyway. The human leads are forgettable at best. The Muppets are hardly even in this film. 2011's meager offerings suggest that film studios have thrown their hands up in the air, and are willing to plunder every sacred institution for next week's paycheck.It's not that good films aren't being made. They just aren't being made in Hollywood.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I was actually offended</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can't call myself a Muppet fan, but I appreciate them and doesn't everyone love Kermit the Frog and Miss Piggy. So I took my wife to see this, her sort of thing and I sat through it. The first red flag appeared with the atrociously sycophantic acting from the very beginning- smiles and facial expressions that made me feel like I was living on a Disney set. This is supposed to be a family orientated film? Anyone?? Why then do we have violence, toilet humour and 'comedy' shows titled 'punch teacher'? The writing was sickly, dull, so ridiculously stereotypical that I can't help but wonder if the execs were under the influence of something when they signed off on this. My wife enjoyed it, or parts of it but admits that some of the humour was dumb- and it really was. Jason Segel (however you spell his surname) wrote and starred in this, I can't help wondering what his intentions were. His co-star, an actress I both like and respect Amy Adams looked like she was standing by for 'Q' facial expressions and scripted vocals. All I can do is shake my head and understand that perhaps it was a fun idea besides a gig for an actor. I think the highlight of the whole film was seeing Whoopie Goldberg and Jack Black who I think saved this waste of a cinema ticket. This should have gone straight to media release because it truly does not deserve screen time. Rant over- avoid.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why Was This Movie Made?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have fond memories of The Muppet Show from the 1970s and this project does not even come close to it.The TV Muppet Show scored on zany, spontaneous humour. The best that may be said of the attempts this movie makes of resurrecting this trait is that I've had better times seeing paint dry on walls. And it wasn't just me either - I viewed this clunker of a movie with parents bringing children of all ages and not a single laugh was heard throughout the entire run, whereas Kermit and Co could be counted on to bring the roof down when the TV show was running.A weak plot coupled to cardboard acting from the lead characters adds to the dismal atmosphere.This is corporate Disney shamefully milking a once cherished trademark for all it's worth.Avoid this movie like the plague if you wish to preserve your fond memories of The Muppets in their prime.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Muppet's just aren't the same under Disney ownership. There's so much Disney product &amp; cast placement in this movie to make you sick, and the Muppet's are now a side act to a live-action story.On a good note; the film inspired me to purchase the original 3 movies as well as the old Muppet shows on DVD.Old fans will feel some nostalgia with the new movie, but you'll get a MUCH better experience going back to the roots of it all.Summary: A few laughs, but the acting is very dry. The music just doesn't seem to fit in most places and is sometimes cringe-worthy. Possibly a good experience for newcomers and young-uns, but it wasn't my cup of tea.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Resurrection</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It had nearly been a decade since the Muppets' last film and I truly believed the Muppets were as dead as most of their original actors. What was the point of keeping them going? It was as though the world moved on without them. However, in 2011 I saw a poster of the upcoming film and slammed my head. "Please no," I thought, "you're going to ruin them with jokes done all wrong!" Amazingly enough I was 100% wrong! This movie not only kept true to the Muppets' original characteristics, but it also resurrected them from the dead! The story is the Muppets are scattered and Walter (who for some reason looks like a Muppet rather than human) and his brother get them all back together to save the theater.I loved every second of this movie! The jokes were perfect, the acting was great, the story was flawless, the songs were memorable, and the voice actors were just like the original voice actors, though Gonzo was the only one with his actual voice actor (welcome back),. I was tempted to sing along with them, even when they had the lyrics at the bottom of the screen. There's so many ways this movie could have failed, but this movie had already been aware of those chances and skipped them or made fun of them. For instance one thing they do is kidnap Jack Black to be their guest star. How many ways could that go wrong? However, not only does Jack keep dirty jokes toned down, but seeing him tied (literally) in with characters from the 1970's is a pathway for the Muppets to adapt to the present. With all the dated comedy that goes on that has died away, it is amazing to see how Jim Henson's comedy can easily adapt to our time and be fresh. Personally, what I loved best was the audience. While in theaters I looked back and saw people who were old and young sitting altogether. The elderly were coming to see something they had grown up with and the children were watching something interesting. They were all laughing together, talking about it, and on my way out I heard two teenage girls singing "Manama". I felt like the movie had unified the young and old generation together. It was the most precious moment I will never forget from any movie.</fullReview>

Thankfully, it was someone who cared more about the integrity of the property than they did about making a few bucks.'The Muppets' is just a delightful film. With a giant heart on its sleeve, it sings and dances its way through a breezy hour and a half of cheerful, can-do storytelling. That's not to say it's dumb. Far from it. It actually has a deceptively sharp wit, but it's never snarky or mean spirited. This is a feel good movie for everyone. I can't recommend it enough.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>With the lights out, it's less dangerous</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Once upon a time, a good-natured hippie called Jim Henson stuck his hands up some socks. This eventually led to him collaborating with the Children's Television Workshop, with whom he produced "Sesame Street", a supposedly ground-breaking television programme designed to educate children.Seeking a more adult audience, Henson produced "The Muppet Show". Essentially Tina Fey's "30 Rock" with felt and psychedelics, the series saw a suave frog, narcissistic pig and various other creatures (called "muppets"), gathering at a theatre to put on old fashioned, vaudeville shows. Audiences loved it.Released in 2011, James Bobin's "The Muppets" is set decades after the demise of "The Muppet Show". Written by Jason Segel and Nicholas Stoller, the film's formulaic plot finds various muppets attempting to save their old theatre from a mean corporation. Most of the film milks the supposedly outmoded, archaic nature of "the muppets" for sentimental, emotional value. This is the film's big mistake. The muppets always offered a postmodern, mocking take on old fashioned vaudeville theatre. Zany, and even kind of edgy, there is little about them that is archaic. Though "The Muppets'" first half is routine, unfunny and overly sentimental, it nevertheless climaxes strongly. When our heroes eventually put on a vaudeville show, the jokes start flying, best of which sees a quartet of singers performing a funny, a-cappella version of Nirvana's "Smells Like Teen Spirit". Other memorable moments include Jason Segel singing "Am I a Man or a Muppet?" and Kermit the Frog singing "The Rainbow Connection", made famous by Henson in his first Muppet movie. An effervescent Amy Adams co-stars.7/10 ? Who'd have thought Kurt Cobain would be saving puppets in 2011?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In spite of some initial development problems ? like the distinguished Muppeteer Frank Oz turning the movie down because of his dissatisfaction with the script ? 'The Muppets' managed to be, as of today, the highest grossing Muppet movie of all time. This big financial success may come off as a surprise, considering that this was the first theatrical Muppet movie in 12 years. Although Frank Oz expressed his dissatisfaction with the script, I would say that the simple, but very effective script (written by Jason Segel and Nicholas Stoller) is the movie's best aspect and maybe the biggest reason why the movie performed so well. From what I gather, the movie's plot is very similar to other Muppet projects, which is a perfect way of not alienating the old fans while reintroducing the characters to new ones.Walter (voiced by Peter Linz) is an everyday Muppet who finds it somewhat hard living in the human world, despite of having a very supportive human brother, Gary (Jason Segel). One day his life changes dramatically ? he discovers the classic Muppet show and is amazed by the Muppets performing in it. When Gary and Gary's girlfriend Mary (Amy Adams) plan to celebrate their 10th anniversary in Los Angeles, they invite Walter to accompany them and in the meantime visit the Muppet studio. Walter there finds out that an evil oil tycoon, Tex Richman (Chris Cooper), wants to buy the studio and raze it to the ground because, apparently, there's oil beneath it. The Muppets' only way of keeping the studio is raising 10 million dollars, and the only way to do so is to put on a show.'The Muppets' has all the charms of previous Muppet projects ? the abundance of gags, the musical numbers and the cameos ? and all of these elements are perfectly combined in one satisfyingly enjoyable movie. The humor in the movie is very self-referential, sometimes self deprecating, and sometimes even filled with subtle social criticism. No matter the form the humor takes, all the jokes and the gags in the movie, with the exception of a rare few, are fun and entertaining. The musical numbers are colorful, original and could easily warm the heart even of some cold bastard who doesn't like musicals (like me). And of course, there are the celebrity cameos, which were quite unforgettable and delightful.While, just a few moments ago, I hailed the effectiveness and the simplicity of the plot in regards of reintroducing the characters to the news generations of fans, I fear those newer fans (myself included) might have a somewhat harder time enjoying the movie than the old fans, since they lack the nostalgia factor. The main character in the movie, Walter, grew up with The Muppet Show, he idolizes its characters, but those of us who didn't have such an experience growing up could have a harsh time emphasizing with him as the movie's protagonist. By all means, the lack of a stronger protagonist in no way affects the movie's fun value, but occasionally you need something more from a movie than just fun value to be truly amazed.Rating: 7/10 Read more at passpopcorn.com</fullReview>

The Muppets are for everyone and goes back multiple generations. And that must have been what Jason Segel was thinking when he came up with the idea of a new Muppet movie, because this movie is one big nostalgia fest! Sometimes it relies a bit too much on the old movies (roadtrip like the first Muppet Movie), but it throws enough new ideas (and awesome songs) to make this movie a new classic! The Oscar-winning "Man or Muppet"is just one song of the awesome soundtrack this movie has. Songs like "Life's a Happy Song" and "Me Party" are guaranteed to get stuck in your head.

The other good thing about this Muppet movie is that the show did not revolve around the Muppets but instead focused on Walter and his brother. This is what made the movie so funny.The Muppets is really entertaining for young children and older audiences. The songs are also better than modern pop music. This movie is definitely a must watch. Your never too old to watch classic Muppets movies and this is just like the many other Muppet movies that have been created.

		<fullReview>Very well made with some very funny comic moments throughout. If I'm honest, I have to admit I found it did lose a little momentum in the middle third. Some nice musical numbers with the stand-out being 'Man or Muppet', I'm sure those who have seen it will agree. All the performances were very good and the puppeteering top notch, as we've come to expect from the guys behind the Muppets. I must also give credit to the voice talents of; Steve Whitmire, Eric Jacobson, Dave Goelz, Bill Barretta, David Rudman &amp; Matt Vogel who provided the voices of all the major Muppet characters. There were also quite a few cameos featured (I'll leave you to figure those out for yourselves). Over all I found this quite enjoyable, if a little schmaltzy here and there, but still well worth a look.SteelMonster's verdict: RECOMMENDEDMy score: 7.3/10You can find an expanded version of this review on my blog: Thoughts of a SteelMonster.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Most of the reviews I saw says the same thing, it is not the same as before, of course it's not, I know does not have the same quality as the old (the very first) ones but we must not forget the important part, this is the first Muppets film in the last decade, last decade I tell you this maybe our last chance to show your kids, heck a chance to show any kid a legacy (not the original I know) of the Muppets, as far as I'm concerned (and concerning the film is not that bad) this is a good film to watch with your kids, a good film to watch without your films, heck the minute I saw Kermit going outside the theater it bring a tear in my eyes, as a fan never forgotten about Muppets, this is a good film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A truly sweet movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While never as artful as, say the best of the Pixar films, this has a sweet heart, and a goofy sense of self-deprecating humor. Definitely aimed at kids first. But with enough clever twists on old movie clichs, jabs at 1980's culture, great little celebrity cameos and kidding of standard Hollywood storytelling that there is plenty to keep a grown up smiling and entertained. Alan Arkin has a priceless couple of minutes, and Jack Black proves himself a good sport indeed. A tip of the hat to the lead human performers Jason Segel and Amy Adams who catch just the right note of real emotion, mixed with a friendly wink at the audience so that we care, but it never feels sappy. Segel was a co-writer as well, and created a story where we can actually be touched by his over- dependent relationship with his inexplicably Muppet brother Walter. A really 'nice' fun family movie, where 'nice' is not a backhanded compliment, but as an honest one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Finest Muppets Film Of Them All</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The more I think about it, the more I realize that I never really liked the Muppet films. Don't get me wrong, I love the Muppets themselves, and The Muppets Take Manhattan is one of my all time favorites, but the rest of the Muppet movies haven't quite met my fancy. Alas, this bright new Muppet film, aptly titled The Muppets, was not only a Muppet masterpiece, it's also perfectly fun for even Muppet novices. In a purposely cheesy and paper thin plot, the Muppets and co must raise 10 million dollars to save the Muppet Studio from being torn down by oil tycoon, Tex Richman. The only way to do this: Put on a show! (Of course!) But will the new wave of audience members, who have long since forgotten the Muppets, fall in love with them again? The Muppets is not only a practice in nostalgia, but it also has enough humor and good cheer to easily stand as it's own movie to those who haven't grown up with the Muppets. The whole gang is back (Rizzo the Rat excepted, not that I mind), and they're just as you remember them (even if Statler and Waldorf are just a wee bit less witty). Certain Muppet's screen time is limited (so don't expect Scooter to rival Kermit for the limelight), but having all the Muppets back is certainly a treat. Of course, there are certainly some new Muppets too. The main character, Walter, for instance. Walter is what you would expect from a main character; bland and hopeful. Some of these characteristics were purposefully overdone, others feel less purposeful. The strength of The Muppets come from it's humor, which is fun and varied. Witty one liners, references to previous Muppet films, satire humor, and some slap stick for the kids. There's also a lot of breaking of the fourth wall, which is done superbly to hilarious effect. This is arguably, the funniest Muppet film yet. You feel obliged to laugh, not just from the humor, but from the atmosphere. Everything is just so happy and cheerful, it's feels ridiculous, but in a good way. It's hard for me to imagine someone not smiling during The Muppets. I personally had one plastered on my face for almost the entire run time. Of course, musical numbers also make up The Muppets. And while these numbers aren't quite as memorable (or catchy) as that of The Muppets Take Manhattan, they're fun and oozing with joy. Life's A Happy Song is hilariously happy and cheesy, and the film's villain get's a brief rap which is humorous and unexpected. The Mupppets actually won an Academy Award for the song Man or Muppet. Personally, I thought this was one of the weaker songs in the film, and I'm surprised it was even nominated. By no means is Man or Muppet bad, it's just not that memorable. The acting is appropriately hammy, and audience members will certainly find themselves chuckling from the acting alone. Jason Segel, playing Walter's human brother Gary, and his girlfriend Mary played by Amy Adams don't have much to do during the film, but they at least appear to be having fun. Cameos abound. Whoopi Goldberg, Selena Gomez, Neil Patrick Harris and many others get humorous small parts. Jack Black also receives a slightly longer role, portraying himself. The score by Christophe Beck is comedic and fits like a glove for The Muppets. At times, it feels like it doesn't have much to do, but it does a great job blending with the Muppet world. It would be hard to dislike The Muppets, even if you haven't been a fan of the Muppet's exploits to the big screen. Overflowing with joy and happiness, and with humor and cameos to spare, The Muppets is one of the most fun and enjoyable films I've had the pleasure of seeing. In a world where gloomy films like The Dark Knight trilogy dominate, it's nice to know that happier films like The Muppets are still around.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More of a remake than a restart</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, I love the Muppets. My grown-up kids love the Muppets. I even have a few stuffed ones from Walt Disney World. My grandson is just starting to discover them on DVD's. However, this is the 1st Muppet Movie since 1999 and it shows. Essentially a remake of 2 films: "Muppets Take Manhattan" and the "Merry Muppet Christmas Movie"; plus "The Muppet Show". Too many of the scenes are without Muppets and carried (weakly) by Amy Adams (Mary) and Jason Segel (Gary). "Gary" has a Muppet brother "Walter" which seems to be a matter of criticism in many reviews. Why? Muppet Movies are supposed to be about the fantastic and unusual! Jack Black, the captive MC, is hilarious, as always. Someone funnier should been cast as the "Tex Richman" villain. The Muppet's performances are flawless and other "Muppeteers" voicing the characters (not Frank Oz) is barely noticed. Kermit seems melancholy, in this movie, not happy. Most of the "cameos" have nothing to do and don't advance the plot, but it's nice to see Mickey Rooney again for one last time. ("Let's put on a show") The best scenes involve dancing in the streets and the finale is quite good. (A reprise of old songs: "Rainbow Connection"and Jim Henson's "Mehamena Do-do-do-do-do" nonsense song.) Only a few new songs with "Man or Muppet" being the stand-out. Starts out slowly and picks up steam, but even "Muppets in Space", the weakest and last in the previous film series, is more fun. If this is a restart of the franchise, another restart is needed. Maybe a re-launch of "The Muppet Show"? Disappointing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a tribute to a classic ensemble</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I loved this version! A couple takes perhaps Kermit &amp; the gang's biggest fan (the guy's brother) with them on a trip to Los Angeles with them so that he can see the Muppets' studio, only to see that it's not exactly the place it used to be. When the brother sneaks in, he learns that the person planning to buy the studio plans not to turn it into a "tribute museum" but to tear it down for oil. Upon hearing about this, the family tracks down Kermit via Star Maps and informs him. Kermit then gets the whole gang back together in hilarious fashion and they plan a tribute show. I love the scene where they have to get the stuffy lady to get her to let them do it, but she tells them that they're yesterday's news.Of course, they manage to do the show, and mishaps and calamaties happen along the way. This was a marvelous film, and you will love the cameos and songs. Anyone who loves the Muppets will love this movie. I certainly did! *** out of ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes, I could talk about the Muppets, the humans, the whole hokey plot about the telethon, but, I have something else to bring up.Ever since the Muppets finished The Muppet Show's run, there has been one thing that has pretty much vanished from the Muppets, has been absent ever since The Muppet Movie... The Muppet Theater itself.In 'The Muppets', Several decades of doing productions in every location except the Muppet Theatre is shown in stark detail, as we go back to a Muppet Theater where the sets are dismantled, the audience area dilapidated, the roof is badly damaged... Oh wait, they did that themselves.However, just like the Theater itself, the Muppets themselves have seemingly forgotten what made them so great in the past, and this film re-finds that in spades, culminating in what has to be the most unique case of A Show Within A Show.While they may be older, they may have misplaced some of the ensemble cast that appeared in it, when that infamous set of archways comes along and the music begins, you realise the real reason this film was made.It's not about the trials and tribulations of the newest Muppet...It's not about Kermit trying to save the Muppet Theater...Actually...It's about reviving what made the Muppets so popular then, and making it why they are popular NOW.So, forget thinking about what actors or puppets appear in it and what they do, watch this film for what it is... The return of the classic Muppet experience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just loved this movie, i had never seen anything related to the Muppets and i really didn't want to see it, but this was a really good movie, i mean, i didn't know the characters, their story or anything, but this film made me like them a lot, the songs were awesome and this was the first time i ever heard the rainbow connection and i loved it, my favorite songs from this movie were "pictures in my head" and "the rainbow connection", i also liked "man or Muppet" but not as much as the ones i mentioned, but there are two reasons for me to give it a 9 instead of a 10, the first one was: the final act in the telethon, i dint like this because it was obviously a copy from Malcolm in the middle, it was good but common they could have thought of something a lot better than that, the second one: (and this is where Disney put its unique signature) this part is where gonzo hits Richman with a bowling ball, i mean this was the most unnecessary scene ever made, they had a good ending with a good message "don't give up" i mean, the Muppets loose their studio, then they decide to go back to the top again not giving up, then comes a song, then come the credits and this is where that message was thrown to the garbage ?why? because gonzo hits Richman with a bowling ball and then he looses his memory and gives the muppets the studio back and i realized that Disney was saying "common we don't have the guts to do that, be realistic we are not going to make the characters look like losers, working for succeed, of course not, we are Disney" and thats the main reason it doesn't have a 10 from my part but putting that aside it was a very good movie 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When we were kids one of the shows you were pretty much guaranteed to see was The Muppets. At least everyone knows the characters like Kermit the Frog and Miss Piggy. The Muppets were colorful, funny and the whole family just loved them. Including celebrities, back in the 1970's, The Muppets had every guest star you could imagine including Alice Cooper. Over the decades, The Muppets have never lost their appeal so naturally a movie would eventually come their way again. Disney decided to make a movie just dedicated to the celebration of the Muppets and how much we love them. Making a musical about them is a great idea and seeing the love and joy that went into this movie gave The Muppets a chance for a whole new generation to fall in love with them all over again.Walter, a man born as a Muppet, lives with his human brother Gary in Smalltown. They became Muppet fans when they watched The Muppet Show in their youth. Gary plans a vacation to Los Angeles with his girlfriend Mary to celebrate their tenth anniversary, and he invites Walter along so he can tour the Muppet Studios. Mary feels that Gary's devotion to Walter is detracting from their relationship. In Los Angeles, the three visit the abandoned Muppet studio. During the tour, Walter sneaks into Kermit the Frog's office and discovers Statler and Waldorf selling the theater to Tex Richman, an oil magnate, and his henchmen Bobo the Bear and Uncle Deadly. Waldorf explains that if the Muppets can raise $10 million they can repurchase the theater. Walter overhears Richman revealing his plans to destroy the Muppet Theater and drill for oil underneath. Now Walter wants to get all the Muppets back together, get the popularity going again and save the theater.When I first saw the trailer for The Muppets, I did want to see it because who doesn't love these characters? Plus it would be neat to see an update in the world and see how Kermit and Piggy would react to the new technology around them. But I never got to see it in the theater and my friends said that it was a very cute movie. So I rented it as soon as it came out on DVD and I was actually kind of disappointed. Not in the Muppets, they were a pleasure to watch on the screen again, but the choice to put Jason Segal and Amy Adams in it threw me off. I don't mind having actors in the film, but as the leads and seeing the way they interact with the Muppets was just strange to me. Maybe a little too goody-two-shoes also, feeling like this was meant for just the kids and not for the whole family. Not dismissing the film, like I said there are some really funny moments. I loved the villains of the film and how they cued themselves to laugh maniacally. Seeing the problems in the relationship between Kermit and Piggy?though I never thought that to be the healthiest relationship on the planet, it was still cute to see these two still fall in love all over again. Opposites do attract as we can always see with those two. But I do recommend this for the younger kids, I'm not sure if the adults could get into as much. The film is lovely but should've just stuck to having the Muppets as the main stars.6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm just the average viewer and never really write movie reviews so that should say enough about liking the movie :) I probably went in thinking it was going to be another flop in my eyes because for us in our late 20's and 30's we know and love The Smurfs, The Chipmunks and The Muppets as they originally were. I just thought this was going to have meh' jokes, bad acting, a terrible storyline and made for todays children. I was completely wrong.It had a pretty good storyline that supported everything we love about the Muppets. In truth, I somewhat forgot things about the muppets until I was watching them again and found myself laughing. My one criticism would be some of the songs at the half way point (yes, there are songs but they're pretty short and most were created to have a laugh at). A few of the songs I just found a little too cringe worthy to listen to/watch and probably needed a bit more adult humour in there.My advice, if you were a fan of The Muppet Show, want a movie to relax to and make yourself feel like an 80's kid again then definitely give The Muppets a go.I actually wish they'd bring back The Muppets Show now complete with celebrities us adults adore, adult jokes and crazy muppets antics. Primarily for the adults that loved them and if the kids of today like it then good for them. :)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was never a massive fan of the Muppets as a kid, but I have to confess that I found "The Muppets" movie very entertaining. The story follows a group of Muppets fans who try to get the Muppets back together in order to save their theatre. The Muppets had split up and were following various careers when Gary, Mary and Walter set out to reunite them and save the theatre.It obviously isn't the most taxing of movies and you'll enjoy all your favourite characters. There are also numerous special appearances to look forward to. Jack Black appears in a few very funny scenes and the whole film is very enjoyable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I enjoyed this movie and appreciate it for what it is, a kids movie. Like every other 70's kid, it was a favorite while I was growing up and I was excited to see the old gang brought together again on the big screen. Plot aside, I was a bit annoyed in seeing how the writers went back and forth on the way they presented the Muppets. On one hand it seemed as if they felt they needed the presence of a lot of top name celebrities to make it work, thus we have appearances by Whoopi Goldberg, Neil Patrick Harris, Selena Gomez and Jack Black among others. It seemed obvious that Amy Adams was hired for the sole benefit of having her name connected to the movie, as her role was pointless and her speaking parts rather limited....many times you can see her in the scene but she has absolutely nothing to say. Also many adults in the movie went on about how they 'loved the muppets as kids' but that no one remembered them anymore. It was as if the writers at Disney was under the impression that no one under the age of 13 could possibly have a clue who any of the muppets were and great pangs would have to be made to introduce them. Okay, so great strides are made to 'introduce' the characters. Then when Selena Gomez appears on the screen, fulfilling her roll as a call taker for a telethon (a rather popular Disney star whom I'm sure many of the intended audience is more than familiar with) she looks at the muppets and says "I don't know who you are I just came because my agent told me to show up" Really Disney? You go through the expense and effort to have Selena Gomez make an appearance, only to have her more or less dis the characters you are obviously trying to build and reintroduce?? In short, the plot was okay but the muppets are timeless, the whole storyline about them being old and unpopular was unnecessary. They could have been introduced to the younger generation with a fresh story and they would have still enjoyed it, and if they saw them as 'new' characters, so what? Mickey Mouse has got more than a few years on them, and I've never seen him introduced as a worn out, washed up character.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The muppets are charming as usual, but this is no classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you really want to see the muppets make you smile and laugh, I suggest revisiting their much earlier pictures instead. I also suggest skipping the second adventure "The Great Muppet Caper", being that it is inferior to movies 1 &amp; 3. Still, this new one is pleasant enough. And why, after all these years (of about a handful of muppet movies), would the filmmakers settle for just "The Muppets" as the title. You'd think there'd be a better title than that, named as if this were their first movie! As for the human characters, I'm not so sure they're fleshed out enough, especially the villain. I know it's only a muppet movie, but the villain needs to be slightly more interesting that what's offered here. However, Chris Cooper does bring more to this character near the end of the movie. I also enjoyed the dance numbers.*** out of ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Walk down Muppet lane a wonderful and sentimental journey</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jason Segel ("Forgetting Sarah Marshal," "How I Met Your Mother") may not be the greatest actor in the business, but his homage to the original "Muppet Show," which ran on syndicated television from 1976-83, shows an amazing amount of class and devotion.And, except for the scenes when he actually tries to sing, the entire enterprise is a hilarious and often emotional experience.For the uninitiated, the Muppets were created by the late Jim Henson and have appeared on television - in one incarnation or another - since 1959. Regular stints on "The Andy Williams Show" and later "Sesame Street" helped cement the group's reputation. The TV show, produced in England, became one of the most successful syndicated programs of all-time.With the main voices of Henson, Frank Oz and others, characters such as Kermit the Frog, Fozzie Bear, Miss Piggy, Gonzo, the Swedish Chef, Animal, Rowlf the Dog, Sam the Eagle, curmudgeons Statler and Waldorf and many, many others, became part of the American entertainment culture of the late 1970s. This popularity led to a string of major motion pictures (none after 1983's "The Muppets Take Manhattan," however, are worth mentioning).The team was even featured in a Saturday morning cartoon series, "Muppet Babies," from 1984-92. It has been about 12 years, though, since the Muppets have starred in a feature film.Now, thanks to Segel (who co-wrote with Nicholas Stoller, "Yes Man," "Get Him To the Greek"), the puppet amalgamation is now back on the big screen. And it's plot point of returning to the days of the actual TV show is what makes this one so special.Story has brothers Gary (Segel) and Walter (a Muppet voiced by Peter Linz, mainly known as the voice of Snook the Sloth on the kiddie show, "It's a Big World") growing up loving "The Muppet Show" in the '70s. Walter dreams of one day joining the troupe, but he knows it is just a fantasy.Meanwhile, Gary has been dating Mary (Amy Adams, "Enchanted," "The Fighter") and plans to take her to Hollywood to celebrate their "anniversary." As a surprise, he will also take Walter and visit the famous Muppet Studios.When they arrive, however, they find the venue a dirty, abandoned hovel. To make matters worse, Walter overhears that greedy oil magnate, Tex Richman (Chris Cooper, Oscar winner for "Adaptation"), plans to bulldoze the place and drill for oil.Alarmed by the news, Walter enlists Gary and Mary to round up as many of the Muppets as possible to raise $10 million to prevent this from taking place. Kermit (voice of Steve Whitemire, it will take fans a little while to get used to this Henson replacement) is easy enough to find, and once aboard, the search is on for the other main characters.This road trip leads to Reno, where Fozzie (Eric Jacobson) fronts a "tribute" group ("The Moopets"), and other locations where Gonzo owns a successful plumbing supply company, Sam the Eagle is the host of a Fox-like show called "Everything Stinks," Animal is in anger management with Jack Black, and Dr. Teeth and band are playing for coins in a subway.Even Miss Piggy (Jacobson) is located in Paris, where she is the "plus-size editor" of a chic fashion magazine.Walter then tries to pitch a telethon to save the theater from Richman, but no one is biting. Finally, a network run by Veronica Martin (Rashida Jones, "Parks and Rec") is willing to give them a chance, as long as they can come up with a celebrity host within 48 hours. The solution, kidnap Jack Black and force him to be part of the proceedings.With the beloved characters most of us grew up with, some song and dance numbers (Kermit and Piggy reprise the "Rainbow Connection" tune from the first film in 1980), lots of laughs and a nice serving of heart, "The Muppets" shines on the screen.Add to this an amazing number of cameos, including Alan Arkin, Mickey Rooney, Zach Galifianakis, Sarah Silverman, Neil Patrick Harris, Ken Jeong, James Carvil, Whoopi Goldberg, Judd Hirsch, John Krasinki, Selena Gomez, Foo Fighter David Grohl and Jim Parsons ("The Big Bang Theory") as Walter's human alter ego, and the trip is even more delightful.With several animated family films to choose from right now, including "Hugo" and "Arthur Christmas," this one certainly leads the list and will bring back lots of chuckles and maybe a few nice memories, as well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's Time to Re-Meet the Muppets</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Off television for 30 years and off the big screen for 12, The Muppets are finally back in a whole new adventure to dispense the third best gift in the world: laughter. This time, instead of the late Jim Henson at the helm, Jason Segel, James Bobin and others succeed in filling some big shoes thanks in large part to their nostalgia for the characters.The plot centers on two brothers Gary (Jason Segel) and Walter (voiced by Peter Linz), one a man and the other a Muppet (either someone was adopted or theirs something odd going on). The two along with Gary's longtime girlfriend Mary (Amy Adams) travel to Los Angeles to find The Muppets are no longer together. After uncovering a nefarious plan to level the Muppet theater, Walter seeks out Kermit the frog to save it.Using "The Blues Brothers" plot outline, a large portion of the film involves getting the gang back together. This is of course peppered with celebrity cameos and infectious musical numbers with great results. "Life's a Happy Song" is a particularly catchy tune. The rest of the film involves the gang putting out all the stops to save their beloved theater with a TV telethon.A lot of the time watching The Muppets was like eating mom's home made apple pie during a 15 minute lunch break. It's comforting, familiar, and oh so good, but its sweetness can't be savored too quickly. The story seemed to be in such a hurry that at times it gets contrived. A lot of it probably has to do with my personal feelings of nostalgia (90 minutes? I would have been happy with 3 hours of Muppets!), part of the problem however lies with the films coy self-awareness. It's funny to occasionally break the fourth wall or look directly into the camera but when major hurdles are handled in under 2 minutes the joke wears a little thin.The problems with the movie are thankfully overshadowed by a cast who truly care. Amy Adams and Jason Segel who co-wrote the script possess an obvious admiration for the Muppets. Many of your favorites, while voiced by different people are still the same goofy little critters we all grew up with and Walter makes a great addition. I won't spoil the end other than to say I was pleasantly surprised by it. The message was so profound and heartfelt that I completely forgot that it was being expressed by a felt puppet.http://theyservepopcorninhell.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Their back...not better than ever but getting there.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me start this review by saying how much of an effect The Muppets have had on my life (particularly my childhood.). I have honestly have probably seen every thing Muppet related from every episode of the original TV show to their more recent direct to DVD attempts, and through thick and thin I'll always be a Muppet fan, but I was apprehensive going to see this film. After the lukewarm at best Muppets from Space I don't know a single Muppet fan that isn't a little iffy about what the next big Muppet project would be like.2011's The Muppets is far from the best Muppet outing of all time but it does some very clever things to make the film enjoyable. It is painfully self aware of the age and popularity drop of The Muppets sometimes to a fault, as expected the jokes of these types are hit and miss. It also takes 2 ADULT humans and a new Muppet and throws them into The Muppet universe in a surprisingly effective manner. The reasons this movie succeeds is the same reason its not perfect and that is the fact it 1. Doesn't take itself serious at all. 2. The main "plot" is literally about 7 different little plots used to set up gags and bring The Muppets together, and 3. ENDLESS FAN SERVICE.The film begins in the town of Smallville where we meet our main "not so much protagonists but main focus of the first 30 minutes of the film." Gary and his puppet brother Walter. Walter being different from others growing up found comfort in The Muppets and their show and always dreamed of going to the (im pretty fictional) Muppet studios. Gary is a likable, up beat, young man that loves his puppet brother more than anything in the world except maybe his girlfriend Mary and decides to celebrate his anniversary taking his bother and girlfriend to LA to fulfill his brothers dream and celebrate his 10th anniversary with Mary. When the 3 get to LA they see the Muppets lot in ruins and all but forgotten, and through some coincidence Walter hears of I local oil tycoons plan on buying and destroying the studio in a funny sequence where the films writers themselves crack fun at the giant plot dump of a scene it is. From then on its up to Walter and company to reunited The Muppets to help raise the 10 million dollars they need to save their studio (that none of them use anymore so we don't really known why its important to save it we just roll with the punches.) The 2nd and 3rd act are essentially set pieces showing what The Muppets are up to after their fame has dwindled and The Muppets trying to put on a great show after years of no practice and little relevance in pop culture, and its pretty much all fan service, great cameos, solid jokes, and solid songs follow. I guess my main problem with this is it makes the original 3 main characters pseudo-plots seem tacked on...and it seems this way because they are tacked on, also The Muppets internal conflict with one another in preparing for the show becomes the antagonizing factor and the "villain" jumps on and off screen about as much as Dr. Claw from the Inspector Gadget cartoon series.I guess a more cynical watcher could say this film is The Muppets standing around looking at the camera screaming "WE STILL EXIST!" and I guess they would be right but for me this film was just good old fashion fun with all the trimmings. So, is The Muppets better than The Muppet Movie or even maybe better than the best Muppet film of all time A Muppet Christmas Carol...no its also not better than The Great Muppet Caper, or Muppet Treasure Island in my opinion, but it is something to work from for a new reboot of the brand and is certainly enjoyable. Gaps in funny moments, lack of genuine conflict (and lack of Statler and Waldorf even though they are in the film and have some classic lines.) and a tangled "plot" holds the film back from the adventure it could've been and has us settle for a self aware reintroduction to some of my favorite characters of all time and Im okay with that and I feel lots of other people will feel the same.The Muppets IMDb Rating: 7/10 Star Rating: ***</fullReview>

But why push ideas on people. "Evil Oil Baron" . But enough of that.The movie is a solid 7. I found it funny and entertaining. I am a huge muppets fan and thought they did a good job. It has that guy from forgetting sarah marshall, and i like him. I did think that is was a little serious for a muppet movie and not silly like it use to beI am just happy to see the muppets back. I really wish i could have seen this movie in the theater</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Muppets (2011) - It's Time to Play the Music! It's Time to Light the Lights! It's Time to Meet the Muppets!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's been a long time since Kermit the Frog, Miss Piggy, and the whole Muppet gang all joined on screen together. It's been nearly 12 years since these lovable cast of characters made their last appearance in "Muppet Treasure Island". In a year of CGI-Pixar movies, and climatic conclusions to life-long movie franchises, such as "Harry Potter", it's time to make some room for some little fuzzy puppets that sing corny songs, with their hearts tied in a "Rainbow Connection". But I know what you are wondering: "Do people still really care about the Muppets? Are they still relevant to audiences?"". Those two answers are "yes"! "The Muppets" is a sweet, charming, hilarious, and innocent family film that really stands out for all audiences, big and small. Jason Segel and Amy Adams are just terrific as the love-struck duo of Gary and Mary, a couple who go to Los Angeles for their 10-year anniversary. Then, we meet a new Muppet named Walter, Gary's brother who is a huge Muppet fanatic, and he travels to L.A. with Gary and Mary to meet the Muppets for the very first time. But they soon find out that an evil tycoon, portrayed by Chris Cooper, is determined to destroy the Muppet Theater to dig for the oil underneath. So, Walter, Mary, and Gary, then team up with Kermit, to find all the other Muppets, and reunite them all for their comeback show, to help save the theater. There were so many wonderful things that I enjoyed about this movie. First of all, it was super fun watching the Muppets again, and it made me feel like a kid again. The laughs are family-friendly, and the humor is childish in a special way. Also, I really like the way that the movie tries it's best to not be that corny. Whether they're traveling by map, making maniacal laughter, or ending up in a musical number, this movie knows how to spot the clichs. But I mostly enjoyed all the fresh and "up-to-beat" musical numbers, especially the powerful "Man or Muppet" number that made me cry and sing in my seat. Those musical numbers were catchy, enjoying, and fun to watch. This movie also has a really powerful heart, and brings out a heartwarming message that even kids will understand. The Muppets are still relevant today, and it will start a range of brand new fans of these beloved characters. It was a fresh return for this lovable cast of puppets. But I hope you can get that "ma-na-ma-na" song out of your head after the closing credits. It'll help you decide whether you're a real man or a real Muppet. "The Muppets", in my review, "a charming and innocent return of beloved characters".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>OK, it's not classic Muppets, but...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It may not have the elements of the original, but this is a very family friendly film, with something for everyone. Leave your prejudices at the door, ignore the niggles about characters and those involved, just go with it, let yourself go and have a fun time! We went as a family, from the youngest to the oldest, and everyone got something from the film. The smallest child sat giggling throughout the film, my Mum, pushing 70, was wiping away tears of laughter. Everyone laughed out loud, enjoyed the whole experience, and we had a great time. There were a couple of things I could have lived without, I found the human characters a tad over twee, and their songs a bit much, but they moved things along, and the kids enjoyed those parts.The chickens singing "Forget You" had me crying with laughter in my seat thinking of the original Cee Lo Green title.Overall, I think the best thing to say about the film is Mahna Mahna! Maniacal laugh, maniacal laugh, maniacal laugh!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This film is sweet, nostalgic fun, even if the plot is a bit thin and forced, at times</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gary (Jason Segel) and his brother Walter have always been quite close, even though Wally is VERY different, resembling a Muppet. Naturally, Walter is entranced when the re-runs of the Muppet Show come on. Now adults, the two of them still live together in Smalltown, where Gary has been dating beautiful teacher Mary (Amy Adams) for ten years. As the anniversary approaches, Gary hatches a fab plan. The three of them will go to Los Angeles, where they will tour the Muppet sets. Later, Gary and Mary will have a romantic dinner, just the two of them. However, when the trio arrives at Muppet studios, they find the place in crumbling shambles and none of the stars are there. In addition, a rich oilman (Chris Cooper) is buying the sets, only to demolish them and dig for the oil underneath. Horrors! Gary and Walter's only chance of saving the place is to raise over 1 million dollars. Fat chance, right? Well, perhaps not. If they can track down the old crew, from Fozzy Bear to Miss Piggy to Animal and the rest, and stage a telethon-reunion of the Muppet Show, they might work magic. Can they do it? This is a sweet, nostalgic film for fans of the original Muppets and the cast. Segel, Adams, and especially Cooper do very nice work and sing well. Moreover, the folks voicing the Muppets and the nice, large cast of cameos, including Jack Black, Rashida Jones and Emily Blunt, are most worthy as well. The look of the flick is also quite nice, being very vibrant, with handsome sets and costumes. Also very fine are the musical numbers, with catchy tunes and clever lyrics. About the only misgivings a viewer might have is the plot is a bit thin, at times, while the pace is somewhat sluggish and the running time a bit too long. Yet, for all of that, the Muppets are always welcome and so is a family film. In this light, most folks of a variety of ages will enjoy a showing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Muppets</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's time to play the music, it's time to light the lights...but where are the Muppets? They've gone their separate ways, forgotten and abandoned by the world of showbusiness. And now three fans (Jason Segal, Amy Adams and...Walter...)must work to bring them together again, before the famous Muppet Theatre is torn down by an evil oil baron (Chris Cooper)...One could almost be tempted to argue that anyone who didn't like at least one second of this film is actually a cold blooded reptile with no heart. Because "The Muppets" will drag you into its world of colour and laughter and, above all, optimism and you will willingly be dragged. Reminiscent of many of the Let's Put On A Show Movie Musicals of the early days of Cinema, but, more importantly, of the wonderful television show that first brought the Muppets to fame and fortune, this new addition to their movie cannon is a wonderful tribute to the philosophies and teachings of Jim Henson.Certainly Segal, one of the writers of the script, is responsible for this achievement. In lesser hands the script could fall into two dangerous territories: pastiche or corniness. Thankfully, Segal has brilliantly walked the tightrope between the two. More importantly, he and fellow human co-star Amy Adams are reduced to Supporting Artists. They recognise that the real stars of this film are Kermit, Miss Piggy et al, and, a few hilarious winning cameos aside, the humans always stay in the background.The Muppets do shine so brightly in this film, that, like Krmit's grand entrance, it can be difficult to shield your eyes from them. Sadly not all of them get the screen time they deserve - Gonzo in particular feels slightly underused, although arguably he was the main character in their last big screen outing, the underrated "Muppets From Space" - but then this gives the opportunity to some of the lesser Muppets to enjoy the limelight, in particular the Swedish Chef who gains one of the film's biggest laughs by essentially committing mass Muppet murder.The music in the film is sublime - in particular the songs by Bret McKenzie, one half of Flight Of The Conchords. "Man Or Muppet" works brilliantly in particular, both touching and hilarious. But they also find time to fit in some classics - "Rainbow Connection" still sounds as good as it did back in the seventies, and the immortal sounds of "Mah Na Mah Na" pulse through the end credits.There are times, though rare, where the film becomes a little too gooey in terms of sentimentality, and the ending feels rushed - but then, his is a Muppets movie. Everything has to become right in the end, and thank Fozzie, it does.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining, light and easy-going movie for everyone</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The old Muppets' theatre is in danger: greedy oil businessman Tex Richman wants to get control over it to dig for oil reserves that are under the theatre. Walther, who is on the trip to LA with his brother, accidentally hears the plan, and now it is the race against the time: Muppets have to reunite to raise $10,000,000 to save the theatre.When I first saw the trailers for the Muppets, I was amazed. Finally, good old-fashioned parody is coming along, with nice little subtle jokes about almost just everything on Earth! "The Immigrant Song" trailer was probably even better than the original one. However, the actual movie lacks this grit, and it is easy to understand why.It is impossible to judge the Muppets as the normal movie we usually see in cinemas. The biggest obstacle is acting: Muppets don't act! They simply open mouths and run around, trying to make us laugh. So the biggest deciding criterion for this movie is its humorous delivery: is it funny at all? And with respect to that question, Muppets the Movie had to overcome at exactly the same obstacle that Muppets the Show constantly tries to balance: they need to decide whether they are producing something for children or for grown-ups. You try to please everybody ? and you fail to please anybody.I feel Muppets the Movie though tries to concentrate on young audience more. This light festive movie, filled with songs and sunshine, makes a good watch for under-10, funny and entertaining. Of course, there are a few brilliant jokes that keep adults entertained ("Classic!" being my personal favorite), and Muppets are still as charming to everyone as they always were. Cameos by Jim Parsons, Emily Blunt and many other, as well as brilliant performance of Jack Black as, surprisingly enough, Jack Black, bring a lot of shine into the movie.As for the two real leading actors in the movie, Jason Segel and Amy Adams, I think they didn't understand either what kind of movie they are playing in. Jason Segel keeps this overly kind, "charmed-by-everything-in-the-world" type of face all the time, making you a bit worried about his acting potential. Amy Adams, on the other hand, acts as if she is in rom-com, which is close enough, but definitely in dissonance with Segel.But, as I said, we don't watch Muppets to see Oscar-winning performance. It is all about jokes, and even though I expected a bit more (expectations were too high after the trailer), it is still a very nice movie, one that you would love to go with your children because you are not going to die from boredom in the end.Mahna-Mahnam.VERDICT: festive and charming comedy, which is genuinely for all the family members.WATCH: if you are with children, or just want to get a nice portion of laughter.m-picturegoer.blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I suppose I am a bit of a contradiction because I, as a rule, do not like musicals and yet I am a huge muppets fan. I have most their movies and some of the original Muppet Show seasons. I also liked the cartoon versions of the muppets. I am almost 36 and have 11 nieces and nephews of all ages. Over the years I have seen them and other kids buy things with the muppets on them and even Mickey Mouse... without really knowing who they are. I am so glad that the next generation will have the opportunity to fall in love with Kermit, Miss Piggy, Fozzie, Gonzo... and of course the critics. They really are about fun and friendship. It's all there - comedy, drama, romance, sci-fi - what more could you want? If you knew the Muppets, fall in love with them again. If you haven't known them, watch The Muppets and you will probably fall in love.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You either love or hate the Muppet's, I'm on the side of love. There self aware comedy is one that can entertain children and adults alike and it really is commendable.Though I'd love to give this film a 10/10 for pure enjoyment and its uplifting spirit, it is by no means perfect. Some of the jokes are a little forced and the exclusion of Rizo the rat I thought was a little silly, as his and gonzo's relationships is what made previous instalments so fun.But these are minor grievances with a film that will fill you with joy and is perfect to take kids too. The whole gang really haven't lost there sparkle, the film will not convert people who hate the Muppet's, but for those like myself who love them its a great addition to the series.I feel there are some paths unexplored here and with the success of the film, I hope more will be made. I personally would like to see another Christmas carol or treasure island, but this is not necessary, because if the writing is as concise as this keep doing them this way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"It's Time To Put On Make-up, It's Time To Pass The Torch!..........."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>WE WERE FIRST introduced to Jim Henson's Muppets via the television commercial. They had done some ads for a national dairy conglomerate; whose local affiliate in Chicgoland was KRAML. "Funny things happen to people who don't drink KRAML Milk"....was a familiar and most amusing tag-line. This was in the late '50's to early '60's.WELL, DUE TO the ensuing success on the JIMMY DEAN SHOW, SESAME STREET and ultimately, THE MUPPETT SHOW, the band of Henson's characters became widely known. At one point, Circa 1978, we could find no one who did not watch THE MUPPETT SHOW; which then aired in Chicago, Saturdays at 6:30 P.M., over WGN TV, Channel 9.WELL, TIME HAS marched on and Mr. Henson has passed on; but the characters were still popular and widely recognized, even to a world-wide audience. With Muppett Productions now a part of what is the Walt Disney Organization, their continued exposure and development is assured. Kemit the Frog, Miss Piggy, Fozzie Bear, Rolf and all have climbed to the status of cultural icon and are virtually immortal.ALL THE WHILE, with all of the various movies and TV projects, Father and Mother inevitably got involved in the process. We are of course referring to Father Time and Mother Nature; as the kids who grew up with THE MUPPETT SHOW reached young adulthood and in turn, "became fruitful and multiplied!" The Muppett phenomenon was now being passed on to another generation.BUT WHAT TO do as a cultural touchstone and to both lick off the "new age" of Henson's creations; while at the same time, exploiting the name and thus translating this into a strong showing at the Box Office? (In other words, $$$$$!) THE ANSWER WAS to stick with what had already been working, only more so. The resulting project, simply titled THE MUPPETTS, brought back the musical comedy format that had worked so well. Obviously, no expense was spared and this picture was certainly as high quality of a product as any previous outings.WE FIGURE THAT both Mr. Walt Disney and Mr. Jim Henson were done proud.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"The Muppets" will put a smile on your face! My favorite film of 2011, it is a zany, nostalgic rush!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm what you'd call a casual fan of the Muppet characters. Jim Henson's creations weren't a huge part of my childhood, as I grew up when their popularity started to wane in the 90's. Although "Muppet Christmas Carol" and "Muppet Treasure Island" were among my childhood favorites, and I did watch repeats of the "Muppet Show" on trusty old cable. I loved the characters, but wasn't an enormous fan. However, over the past few years, in my early 20's, as I have started to explore different films, I rediscovered their magic, and have become a bigger and bigger fan, watching the show and the old films more and more. So I was excited when this movie was announced not long after I became a fan again, as it seemed to coincide with my re-discovery of the characters, making it seem like perfect timing on my part.This is a marvelous film. Plain, simple, true. It has an appeal for everyone, child or adult. It's characters (human and muppet alike) are all likable and fleshed out, the production is high quality, and it has an enormous heart. This is one of the few films I've seen recently that had the ability to put an enormous smile on my face, and keep me grinning (and occasionally crying) throughout.This is also a return to form for the characters, who have fallen into obscurity lately, and it treated them all with respect and care. This is as good a tribute to Henson's work as possible.The film was directed by James Bobin and written by Nicolas Stoller and Muppet-fanatic Jason Segal, whom also co-stars. And you can tell it was written by a Muppet fan in Segal. His love for the characters helps this film soar above and beyond.We open with two brothers- Gary (Segal) and Walter. Gary is a human, while Walter is, somehow, a Muppet. Both a very close with one another, even though Walter sometimes feels down as a Muppet in a human family. However, upon discovering "The Muppet Show" as a child and realizing he is not alone, Walter feels better, and is now the world's biggest Muppet fan.When Gary plans on taking his girlfriend Mary (Amy Adams- what needs to be said, she's perfect) to Los Angelas to celebrate their tenth anniversary as a couple, he decides to take Walter along, so he can go on a tour of the Muppet studios.Walter is excited, but realizes that since falling into obscurity in today's world, the Muppets have broken up and spread over the world. Walter also hears a devious scheme by oil-man Tex Richman (Chris Cooper as a hilarious villain), whom plots on demolishing the Muppet studio to drill for oil, and he sets out with Gary and Mary to bring the muppets back together and save the studio the only way they know how- by having a show!From there on, the movie turns into a hilarious and heartfelt road trip picture, as we are re-joined by Kermit, Miss Piggy, Gonzo, Fozzie and the others, as they come together once again!The film is exceptionally well made. Bobin's direction is light and kinetic. Some wonderful musical numbers by Brett MaKenzie are fun and memorable (including this year's Oscar nominated "Man or Muppet"), the writing is top notch, and as I said, this film has something for everyone, young or old, newcomer or Muppet Veteran. The acting is also perfect (particularly from the Muppeteers including Steve Whitmore, Eric Jacobson, Dave Goelz and Peter Linz as the new Mupper Walter), finding the right balance between campy and at times satirical performances, and seriousness. The whole movie walks a very meta/satirical line, actually. (A lot of the movies did, but this one moreso) And I will say, it skillfully and perfectly navigates this line without going too far, as many films do.And as I said, this is also a very emotional film. Segal obviously appreciates these characters, and delivers a story that will supply plenty of tears. The Muppets are portrayed as real, honest-to-god "people" with wants and needs, and their own emotional baggage from the world. It does fall into a dangerous trap early on by being a bit too serious, but as it continues and the light and fun are restored, it gets better and better.I am truly and honestly touched by this film. It is one of the finest films of 2011, and is my personal favorite. It's also arguably the best Muppet movie since the original, and will be remembered for years to come as a modern classic and a phenomenal re-introduction to the characters."The Muppets" is a perfect 10!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Muppets are back and better than ever!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Am I a Muppet, or am I a man? If I'm a man, I'm a Muppet of a man. James Bobin was perhaps barely known for his work as a writer in TV series such as Da Ali G Show and The Flight of the Conchords, but after his direction in his first feature film, The Muppets, he will be recognized and remembered for bringing back the 70's film and TV series back to life. Bobin has accomplished what I thought in today's advanced technological world couldn't be done: bring back the Muppets to popular mainstream and make them stars all over again. This film was a very pleasant surprise and didn't just work only as a nostalgic piece, but it also managed to convert new fans with some catchy songs and great cameos. Whoever thought the Muppets were done and over with was wrong, because they've really made millions of new fans and there movie was on par with their greatest shows in the eighties. Seeing these characters back in the big screen without any use of animated effects and just being their old selves was such a great feeling. It allowed for a better story to be told and not just rely on the special effects like so many animated films do now a day. The spirit of Jim Henson is still alive and he would've been pleased with this latest effort. One of the reasons this film worked so well was thanks to the funny script which was written by Jason Segel (who also stars in this film) and Nicholas Stoller. Segel had already proved to be a great writer when he wrote the hilarious Forgetting Sarah Marshall. At the end of that film we came to know about his characters passion for directing a Muppet opera. Perhaps it is really a dream of his and he got close to achieving it with this film. The question I'll have to ask Segel is if he is a Muppet or a man.Gary (Jason Segel) and Walter (muppet voiced by Peter Linz) have been very close since they were born. The two brothers always spend time together and one of their favorite hobby's is watching The Muppets on television. Walter admires the muppets and dreams of meeting them, and one day Gary decides to take him to their Theater in Los Angeles. Gary is actually going to LA to celebrate his tenth year together with girlfriend Mary (Amy Adams), but he convinces Mary to let Walter come with them. Once they arrive at the Museum, they are torn to see the place abandoned and no muppet in sight. While Walter is touring Kermit's old office he overhears a conversation an oil tycoon named Tex Richman (Chris Cooper) is having, saying that he is going to buy the abandoned theater and extract oil from under the sacred place. Walter is terrified after hearing this and decides to search for Kermit in order to let him know about Richman's evil plans. The only way to save the theater is to come up with ten million dollars before the end of the week. Gary, Mary, and Walter find Kermit and tell him they still have time to come up with the money if the Muppets get back together and raise the money. That is when Kermit begins enlisting every one of the muppets one by one and preparing a lived telecast show to raise the money. Veronica Martin (Rashida Jones) decides to produce the show despite believing the Muppets are history because their hottest show got canceled and they need something to cover the hole, but she says they will need a star to host the show. The Muppets find Jack Black and convince him (by kidnapping him) to do it against his will. Thus the show begins and the race against the clock to raise the money.The comedy along with the musicals in The Muppets work to perfection. I loved every one of the songs in this movie, and Kermit's single was so good. Jason Segel and Amy Adams have a special chemistry together. Adams reminds us why we fell in love with Enchanted and Jason Segel plays his useful lovable self. It was such a nostalgic feeling to see The Muppets back in action, but they were great as always. Kermit, Miss Piggy, Gonzo, Animal, Fozzie, Beaker, Rowlf, and company were all spectacular. These are the characters I grew up with so it was really something to see them together once again in such a well written and entertaining movie. Perhaps the weakest part was the villain; Chris Cooper is a great actor but his character was a little over the top. The best part of the film in my opinion was the cameos. I absolutely loved each one of them, but I don't want to give away any surprises. My favorite was the cameo from the Am I a Muppet or a Man song. This is a movie for everyone, fans of the old series and young kids will enjoy this alike. The Muppets is one of the pleasant surprises from 2011. It's definitely worth a watch.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's time to play the music because the Muppets are finally back!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This delightful film co-written by star Jason Segal, celebrates the Muppets and their charming, heartfelt history. If one thing has separated the Muppets from most family entertainment, it's the franchises appeal to adults as well as children. Kids love the vibrant colors and wacky voices, adults love the sly humour and witty cultural references. The 2011 reboot lovingly maintains that style, as the characters leap off the screen and into your hearts.The film, which is as sweet and humble as Kermit the Frog, manages to recreate the charm of Jim Henson's 1970s creations and introduce the timeless characters to a vastly different 21st century audience without an ounce of cynicism. While it is as charmingly scruffy around the edges as Fozzie Bear, the films witty script (which was cleaned up by the folks at Pixar) and lovable characters will win new fans and please long time devotees. Even if the film is not a monumental achievement and some of the musical numbers feel forced, it's hard not to be won over by Jim Henson's fuzzy creations. Also watch out for numerous celebrity cameos in the tradition of the Muppet films of yesteryear.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Muppets Get Enchanted</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I hope my review doesn't have any spoilers, aka, punchlines, but I'll do the check anyways.Summary: The Movie Just WorksWith Amy Adams, the star of Enchanted leading the way, The Muppets enter a new era. The movie still have several dance numbers like the old ones, but they're done in the grandiose fashion like Enchanted (and with humans).Speaking of Fandom, that's another theme for this movie. What fans will do to help the family of their affection.Instead of aspects of characters, this film shows how they have drifted apart and in a vein of Nostalgia, how getting back to recreate when they were great and famous brings their family and strength back.This movie will join the DVD sets of the first three seasons in my home. I hope they'll put out the fourth season soon to join them all.Disclaimer: I own Disney stock (formerly Pixar) because I'm a fan. You and your ho-mies make your own choices not based on mine, OK?

		<fullReview>The Muppets are back once again in a slick and average film which I thought worked and didn't at some points. Note to anyone who doesn't like my review here has to hear me out. I did NOT hate this film nor do I think it was badly made, I just thought that there was some screw up and it wasn't what it used to be like. The Muppet Show and Muppet films which ran from the 60's all the way till the early 2000's was a great dose of fun, everything was played out well to an extent and it was always memorable. This new film is an OK take on but by the end of it, it was nothing but "yes, this was good". When I watched the other Muppet films as a kid, I watched them over and over again (That being Muppets from Space). Anyway, I will point out what I found positive and negative about this film. I didn't hate it but I certainly don't think it's at it's predecessors levels (such as Muppet Christmas Carol or Muppets Take Manhatton).This plot is told really simply.... With the help of three fans, The Muppets must reunite to save their old theater from a greedy oil tycoon. That being Gary, his brother Walter and his girlfriend Mary.Positives: I thought that the messages sent across to each characters was really heart-warming and we could really get a taste of what they were really feeling. We could also connect to them in some ways.I found the sing-alongs really fun and enjoyable (only Muppets singing). I don't usually like that type of stuff but this film did it for me really well. I also thought some of the voice acting was particularly good and I was surprised since most of the actors who portrayed them before have left. The new actors actually did OK. On a positive note as, I was laughing most of my way through this film and I was surprised about how much I laughed at it. The use of cameos as well was a clever idea. The concept I found most interesting about this film was how the film poked fun at itself and related back to it's original stuff back in the 70's. Really kicked up a vibe there which I was really impressed with.Negatives: Even though i loved this film, this film does have many problems which some film these days in general lack. First off, this film was not as good as most of the older movies which went through the 70's-early 2000's era.First off, Disney has gotten itself into many shambles and it has really become a bad filmmaking/TV show company. I mean what happen to their awesome films? Well they've taken the Muppets to a level which it doesn't have that everyone feel. Sure this film does have many laughs but they are soon forgotten once we still think about the older films. Disney just went a bit too much on the lighting, look, feel and tone of it. I liked the old looking cinematography and the time were there weren't all these people around just taking the spot light away from the Muppet's. If you're gonna do a film or show about these characters, you have to have them in the spot light. Not the human actors. I believe Amy Adams and Jason Segal did an excellent job. They were'nt the problem. It was that first starting song and last starting song where we only had like three Muppet's singing while there were a thousand humans? What the heck???? I didn't get that at all.In conclusion, I didn't think this was a bad film nor do I think it was the best of the bunch. I thought this film was gonna blow badly but I was surprised at what it turned out to be like. The film by the way is really well paced and I found the sets good. The overall problem really is it's just not I was used to. I mean I guess I have to move on but The Muppets is something I have liked dearly. But oh well. I would rather watch this than Muppet Treasure Island (which I think is OK) but not the others. Overall also, this Muppet film was a good/bad film and it had some potential going for it. By the way I also found the voice actor for Ms. Piggy and Fozzie really dodgy. The voices kept going high pitched and then low. I really noticed that which wasn't good.My friend did not like this film at all. He found it funny, but nothing new to him and at thought, thinks that this new film was bad in many ways. I can except it for what it is but if you are a real die hard fan of the Muppets, you will either love or hate. I found it in the middle 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Will put a smile on your face</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I never really watched the Muppet Show back in the day. So my review stands on its own and is not influenced by memories of the old show. I went along with the family and this was not my first choice for a movie. Frankly, I entered the theater a little grumpy. I came out with a smile on my face and humming the music. It's funny and clever in a way that adults can appreciate without any objectionable content at all. Some jokes may go over the little ones heads, but it's not because they are risqu. Also, any movie that has Jack Black and Amy Adams in it has to be good. There are a lot of cameos from familiar faces. One in particular is genius -- I won't spoil it for you, but it comes during the "Man or Muppet" song.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Muppets (2011) FILM DEBATE</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>filmdebate.wordpress.com THE PROFESSIONAL: For starters, I didn't grow up with The Muppets TV show. In fact... I didn't even know it existed until I was in my late teens. I did, however, see a few of the original Muppet movies when young, and enjoyed them, and I saw A Muppet Christmas Carol and even Muppet Treasure Island later on. One interesting thing to think about The Muppets in general is that they have truly impacted pop culture in a lasting way. I can't tell you how many times I've heard drummers being compared to "Animal", and the default stereotype in America for Swedish people and the Swedish language has become the "Swedish Chef." The 'Old Guys on the Balcony' (never knew their actual names until reading reviews of the new film) are the quintessential heckler characters. And for me personally, the Muppet representations of the Ghosts of Christmas Past, Present and Future are the standard by which other interpretations are judged.THE MAN WHO WASN'T THERE: I don't mean this in a derogatory way at all, but if I had to choose one word to describe "The Muppets" it would be "competent". It was fun, brisk, and well paced, with some genuinely hilarious moments. I like the idea of "Jack Black" more than most anything he's been in (aside from "School of Rock") but he had a small role that worked pretty well. They also walked the right line between post-modern/meta-humor (it's easy to go overboard on it) and genuine enthusiasm for its "let's put on a show" throwback plot.THE PROFESSIONAL: The Muppets struck me as being similar to Super 8, containing very deliberate reference points to source materials admired deeply by the films' creator(s)...*** continued at filmdebate.wordpress.com ***</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>They're back!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sitcom star (and longtime Muppet fan) Jason Segel sets out to bring the Muppets back into relevance with this nostalgic revival, placing the fuzzy group of comic misfits in the present TV landscape of Reality and trendy youthful programming. "The Muppets" stars Segel as Gary, a man living in Small Town with his brother, Walter (a humanoid Muppet). After stumbling onto the evil plans of oil magnate Tex Richman (Chris Cooper) to demolish the Muppet Theater (long since abandoned) for the black gold hiding underneath, Gary and Walter set out to find Kermit &amp; Co. to save the studio. But the troupe has disbanded, leaving Kermit reminiscing about better days, and alone without the rest of the group. It's up to them to "get the band back together" and save the theater. As Muppets fans, we've been down this road before, with the theater's future called into question and all of the Muppets separated. But Segel uses this simple plot as a jumping-off point to reassemble the clan, and at the same time, introduce them to a new audience. It's been twelve years since the Muppets last graced the big screen, so the primary appeal of the film is rekindling our enjoyment of the those early days when "The Muppet Show" was still on TV. And it works. These are characters that have been gone too long, and their trademark brand of corny jokes and wholesome innocence is desperately needed. The newer voice cast that replaced Jim Henson and the retired Frank Oz do a fine job in their stead, and Segel's joy at being able to act alongside his favorite characters is right up there on the screen. With the stable of characters growing ever larger in the '90s, naturally, many did not make it into the film. Which is reason enough for Disney to give this franchise the push it needs with more movies. But regardless of how Disney decides to handle the Muppets brand, we can be happy with this absolutely worthy installment. Segel really did it. He brought 'em back. The only bad thing (and I hope they rectify this in further movies) is that there's too much attention paid to the humans. 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A truly funny and heartwarming movie which celebrates the Muppet legacy in a cleverly charming way</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Once you get over the fact that it is possible for a human to have a Muppet brother, then this movie is one hugely entertaining affair.Because you see, Jason Segel loves the Muppets so much that he decided to write a script with Forgetting Sarah Marshall director Nicholas Stoller, and have himself play the human protagonist whose Muppet brother helps The Muppets reunite and save their old theatre from a greedy old tycoon. Wait, we take that back. The protagonists in this 98 minute movie aren't humans ? how can we forget Kermit the Frog, Miss Piggy, Fozzie Bear, Gonzo and the rest of the gang?Segel and Stoller's script has The Muppets split up after their once popular TV show stopped running. A depressed Kemit now lives in his own mansion in Hollywood, Gonzo is the owner of a plumbing company named Royal Flush (how in the world did anyone come up with that idea?), Fozzie performs with a shady tribute band called The Moopets, while Miss Piggy is living the life as a fashion editor at Vogue Paris.Enter Gary (Segel), who has a Muppet brother named Walter (Peter Linz, who has been the voice of "Additional Muppets" in other Jim Henson productions), and both of them are great Muppet fans. Gary brings his girlfriend Mary (the wonderful Amy Adams) to Los Angeles for a romantic getaway and brings Walter along. They discover an evil plot where an oil magnate (the gleefully sinister Chris Cooper) plans to tear down the beloved Muppet Theater and drill underneath for oil. The three then go on a quest to bring The Muppets together to put on a show to raise $10 million to repurchase the theater.The musical comedy film has a simple plot, and you know it's not going to disappoint kids with an unhappy ending. And who doesn't love The Muppets? It doesn't matter whether you are a fan, because seeing Kermit, Miss Piggy, Fozzie, Gonzo doing their familiar antics (yes, Miss Piggy will punch people off with her famous "hi yah!", while Gonzo will do his human cannon ball thing) will leave a smile on anyone's face. What about minor characters like Animal, Sam the Eagle, The Swedish Chef, Statler and Waldorf? We aren't forgetting the rest of The Muppets whose names we aren't very sure, but look somewhat familiar. This bunch of puppets is a hoot to fans and new audiences alike.The humans may not be the focus here, but look out for fun cameo appearances by familiar faces like Alan Arkin, Emily Blunt, Feist, Whoopi Goldberg, Selena Gomez, Neil Patrick Harris, Ken Jeong, Zach Galifianakis and Jack Black as an abducted celebrity.The musical numbers are wholesomely fun ? from new songs like "Life's a Happy Song", "Pictures in My Head" and "Man or Muppet", to familiar tunes like "Mahna Mahna", "Rainbow Connection" and the beloved "The Muppet Show Theme", which will have you reminiscing the old days (if you grew up watching them on TV).It also helps that the James Bobin directed movie boasts of some very clever and truly funny moments. Take for example how the gang introduces the muppets in "montage" style, and how they travel across the world "by map". You could see this coming with the hilarious publicity online stunt involving parody trailers (The Pig with the Froggy tattoo, anyone?) the movie had leading up to its opening.That said, there are also some very heartfelt moments which tug at your heartstrings. You will want to celebrate the Muppet spirit, one that is always, for the lack of a better word, happy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Childhood Memories</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember watching the Muppets as a child,I have a particularly good memory of the Muppet's in Space. This doesn't fail to make me regress and just enjoy the movie. It also reminds me of how movies aimed at children can be enjoyed by anyone.Of course the special effects are limited as there are puppets in the movie, but they are used very well, lets just say it is the exact opposite to Team America in reference to the use of puppets.Kermit being the main star is bound to have great lines and makes you laugh and have a good time. However Miss Piggy provides all the sass in the movie and in my opinion that is much funnier.The cast are good, Jason Sagel is great, he can do any comedy acting he wants, from How I met you mother, to Forgetting Sarah Marshal. He just adds to the excellence of the movie and he really completes the ensemble.You cant really faultier the directing, it is lacking at some points, but thats what makes the Muppets special.Overall I thought it was a great movie and didn't fail to live up to my high expectations.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jim Henson's iconic Muppet's from the Muppet show are back on the big screen, this time some fans of their old show convince the Muppet's to put on another show.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm a big fan of the Muppet show, their spin off movies and all of the work of the great Jim Henson. I saw the movie in theaters last Friday and while I'll liked the movie but I think the film is a little overrated. I mean it's a great Muppet movie but I didn't think it was the greatest movie of the year. I don't understand how critics hated the smurfs but loved the Muppet's? Any case this was overall a good movie. Although I thought the plot was a little weak, I mean it was a little too simple or clich. The plot was something we've seen many times. It's the old let's get the gang back together for another show and let's stop that evil guy who wants to destroy everything we love. But the good thing is, it dosen't take it self seriously, so it makes the clich plot OK. The film does a good job of bringing the humor that the old movies had. I love the breaking the fourth jokes, like when Ralph said we didn't show me in the montage, cut to Ralph sleeping in a haymek, waking by Kermit asking if he's in and Ralph is like sure, whatever. The self aware silliness of spontaneously breaking out in song was funny too. I also like that the plot was centered on the old Muppet show from the late 70's, oppose to other Muppet's movies were the Muppet's were set in different situations like Muppet's in outer space. This is not Muppet's in the wild west or Muppet's in Hawaii, it's about that old Muppet show before all the movies. The nostalgia about the old TV show is probably the reason why so many critics liked this so much. Jim Henson and Frank Oz are no longer doing any of the voices but they'eve done a good job replacing them. Especially Miss Piggy, her voice was spot on. In some ways this movie is more for adults, because most kids wouldn't know about the Muppet's or the TV show from the late 70's. The human characters were good, although it was weird seeing a Muppet treated as a human, not a Muppet. And I realized watching this, that Amy Adams is freaking hot! One of the funniest part is when the Muppet's kidnap Jack Black and forced him to host the show, classic Muppet dysfunction! I also like seeing a few pictures of Jim Henson in the background. All in all a good comeback for the Muppet's. The most sensational, celebrational, inspirational, muppetational, this is what we call the Muppet show!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Muppets are back!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a fun, fun movie for all ages. On the one hand, it's absolutely a love letter to "The Muppet Show" and the original Muppet movies, with appearances by even the more obscure Muppet characters (some hidden in the crowd shots). It's a real treat for the longtime Muppet fanatic.And on the other hand, it's a movie that promotes the old show (available on DVD!) and makes the characters accessible to a new generation of fans.The story starts with Jason Segel and his Muppet-like brother Walter, and is more *about* the Muppets in a loving tribute kinda way. But once Kermit, Fozzie, Gonzo, and gang show up, the Muppets themselves (thankfully) take center stage. The human plot (involving Segel, Amy Adams, and Walter) is fun in its way, but the best stuff (understandably) involves Jim Henson's fuzzy creations.Besides Kermit, Fozzie, Gonzo, and Miss Piggy, the Muppet cast includes the Electric Mayhem, Bunsen &amp; Beaker, Rowlf, Sam the Eagle, Swedish Chef, Scooter, Statler &amp; Waldorf, Bobo the Bear, Sweetums, Crazy Harry, Beauregard, Lew Zealand, Uncle Deadly, Marvin Suggs and his Muppetones, the Muppet Newsman, Link Hogthrob, Wayne &amp; Wanda, Thog, Behemoth, Mahna Mahna and the Snowths, and, in a refreshingly limited role, Pepe the Prawn.The movie also introduces the new character of '80s Robot, who is delightful (particularly for viewers old enough to get the jokes).Human Rashida Jones has an important role and does a good job acting with the puppet cast. Likewise Jack Black is surprisingly effective playing the victimized celebrity, a throwback to some "Muppet Show" guest hosts. Chris Cooper is the villainous, Muppet-hating oil tycoon in the classic Muppet cinematic tradition.The songs (by Flight of the Conchords' Bret McKenzie) are fun and goofy and the movie is sprinkled with great celebrity cameos, retro flair, and plenty of winks to the audience. (No one can break the fourth wall like the Muppets.) There are even some touching, sentimental moments to go along with the self-aware parody stuff. And the scenes at the very end are a glorious celebration of Muppets, famous people, and fun! You simply can't leave THE MUPPETS (2011) in a bad mood.The movie captures the crazy, zany, absurd Muppet humor that fans love and is utterly charming all the way through.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nice, neat, clever and well done fun that brought back childhood memories!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Growing up as a little kid in the late 70's and early 80's I fell in love with "The Muppets" watching Kermit on TV and collecting his little plush toys and friend action figures. As his little green face always brought a smile as "The Muppets" were always fun loving and an escape of joy and happiness for me always bringing about a bright rainbow! So it was good to see after many years that a new big screen movie adaptation has once again came to life.Starring Jason Segel("How I Meet Your Mother")as Gary a man who still has a Muppet obsession even after all grown up and now ready to marry his sweetheart Mary(the beautiful Amy Adams),despite this good news Gary hears from his good Muppet friend Walter that an evil oil tycoon Tex(Chris Cooper)is planning on destroying the old Muppet theater, which by the way the Muppets and Kermit are planning on using for a comeback musical show.Yet never fear with the help of Walter, Gary and Mary travel all the way to Hollywood to join little green buddy Kermit and his pals to save the day. Along the way you as a viewer feel happy, sad, and feel good entertaining moments it brings back your childhood memories as a kid when seeing Fozzie Bear, Animal, Gonzo, Rowlf, and outspoken Miss Piggy! Also some eye catching guest appearances are found from Emily Blunt and Alan Arkin. Overall fun feel good film that will bring back and take you to your childhood memories see it if your a "Muppets" fan it's nice to see that cute happy little green friend Kermit again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Creating a New Generation of Memories</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As Kermit the Frog plays his banjo and sings "Rainbow Connection" with his estranged Miss Piggy, I broke into a big smile. "The Muppets" generates retrospective fond memories for me, also reminding me how old I am. Unlike me, The Muppets are timeless. Jason Segel, a dedicated fan of The Muppets, provides irreverent reverence in "The Muppets" as co-writer and human Gary, who helps get "the band" back together. Jason Segel had his signature Muppet moment with the Count Dracula puppet rock opera in "Forgetting Sarah Marshall". I read a review in "Entertainment Weekly" which brilliantly characterizes "The Muppets" as "unironic humor". "The Muppets" is refreshingly unique in its innocent transparency much like its endearing characters. "The Muppets" is just fun and funny.First off, "The Muppets" is a musical?with puppets integrated with humans. I really was not expecting the musical part. We get a clue in the beginning as Jason Segel's Gary and his school teacher girl friend Mary of 10 years, wonderfully played by Amy Adams, who displays her amazing "Enchanted" gifts; suddenly break into song and dance on the crowded streets of very rural Smalltown, Kansas. Director James Bobin has a knack at dialing in the musical numbers without a sledgehammer telegraph. When he doesn't it is intentional. His direction has a distinct charm and follows the natural flow of Segel and Nicholas Stoller's screenplay. Like Segel, we really get Bobin and Stoller's love for "The Muppets". I wonder if The Muppet's wide eyed goofiness overcomes the distinguishing retro charm, and crosses over to a new generation. That would be nice. Hearing Gary Newman's "Cars" blaring on Kermit's radio as they assemble The Muppets for one last show is funny for my generation. At least Segel and Stoller are humorously self-aware. In one hysterical scene, humorless and spunky Rashida Jones as network programming exec Veronica says, "You guys are not relevant anymore!" She also illustrates on a pull out chart. Classic.Part of the ridiculous charm of "The Muppets" is that people and Muppets are integrated unquestionably. Gary has a diminutive younger brother Walter, who looks amazingly like a Muppet, but no one else in the movie seems to notice. Gary lives with Walter, who is a huge Muppets fan. The Muppets speak to him. Walter (voiced by amazing Peter Linz) is gentle and proud in his geek-dom, which is awesome given the current state of bullying. To celebrate the 10th anniversary of their relationship, Gary plans a vacation with Mary (Adams) to Los Angeles. However, Walter is also coming along so they can go on The Muppets Studio tour. Earnest Gary is clueless to Mary feeling emotionally threatened by his protective love for his little brother.Much to Walter's chagrin, The Muppets Studios is a deteriorated shell of what it was. Eavesdropping on oil tycoon Tex Richman (hysterically evil Chris Cooper), Walter discovers the dark conspiracy, and Richman's selfish motives for the property. According to the lease Kermit signed, unless The Muppets come up with $10 million, the Studio will belong to Richman. Gary, Mary, and Walter track down Kermit to save the Studio. The Frog seems to have become a recluse in his mansion, joyless in his retirement. There is no Piggy, the love of his life. Walter pleads with Kermit to get the Muppets back together so that they can raise the money with one last show?a telethon. Walter convinces Kermit, "You're my hero?" Thus, the journey begins. It is great reuniting with the gang like Fozzy, Gonzo, Scooter, and Dr. Teeth. I especially loved the Animal reunion. We find Animal in an Anger Management 12 Step retreat with his sponsor Jack Black, playing himself. Black is great. Across the Atlantic Miss Piggy is the Plus-Size Editor of French Vogue in Paris. Emily Blunt is at her "The Devil Wears Prada" best as Piggy's hot haute Assistant. But apparently, Kermit refuses to admit to Piggy that he specifically needs her, more than just "they need". Will the Muppets save the Studio? Will Walter discover the greatness within himself? Will Kermit get off it and be with Piggy? What other celebrities will drop in for cameos? Remember this is "The Muppets". Things have a way of working out. It is more than just a trip down memory lane. "The Muppets" is fun and loads of laughs. And yes, we still cheer for them after all these years.</fullReview>

When Greg decides to take his long time girlfriend Mary (Adams) on a anniversary trip to Hollywood Walter gets to come. Walter's dream has always been to meet the Muppets. When the get to Muppet studios it is run down and the gang is no longer together. Walter overhears about a plan to tear down the studio and it is up to him to try and save the landmark and the Muppets. I have to admit I was super excited to see this. I have been a life-long Muppet fan. I had very high expectations for this and it did not disappoint at all. This movie had all the classic Muppet movie things that I was wanting. The self-awareness, the adult humor, cameos and even call backs to the original movie. There really isn't much I can say to sway you to watch this or not...either you love the Muppets or don't care about them. I do have to say that when they did the Muppet Show opening song I almost teared up. This movie will make you feel like a kid again. Overall, if you love the Muppets like I do, you will love this movie. I give it an A.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>They did it!! It works!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When you take on an old license, and try to bring it back you have to balance a few priorities. The old fans need to be respected, they were the ones that supported the franchise in the first place and are your primary demographic. Then there is the uninitiated. The potential new fans who missed it the first time. You have to make sure they don't feel left out by a string of nostalgia and inside jokes. And so you strive to update with respect, bring new people up to speed and still speak to the fans. The Muppets made this old fan feel like he was going home again, and my 8 year old daughter laughed all the way through and came out exclaming it was "Awesome!" So there you have it, if you loved the Muppets, or don't know who they are but think you might like them, this is a great movie for you. I guess if you know the Muppets but hate them, then you should just wait for the DVD and watch the Statler and Waldorf outtakes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>'The Muppets' done right!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'THE MUPPETS': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)Reboot of the popular Jim Henson created puppet film series, which began in 1979 and was based on the television series which ran from 1976 to 1981. It was directed by James Bobin (co-creator of the television series 'THE FLIGHT OF THE CONCHORDS') and written by it's star Jason Segel and Nicholas Stoller (who directed 'FORGETTING SARAH MARSHALL' which also starred Segel). It's the first 'MUPPETS' feature film in a dozen years and is highly reminiscent of the films that were popular in the late 70's and early 80's rather than the more recent crop. The movie is the perfect tribute to the long running series and should please almost any fan. The story revolves around an evil businessman named Tex Richman (Chris Cooper) who's plotting to tear down the Muppet theater and drill for oil beneath it. Three big Muppet fans named Gary (Segel), Gary's girlfriend Mary (Amy Adams) and Gary's puppet brother Walter (voiced by Peter Linz) discover this while touring the old abandoned theater. They learn that the only way to save the Muppet theater is to raise $10 million so they go searching for Kermit (voiced by Steve Whitmire) to let him know. Kermit and his new friends then decide to go on a road trip to find the other Muppets (who have all split up) and devise a plan to put on a fundraiser show in order to raise the money to save the theater. The film is surprisingly witty and packed with laughs, the music and dance numbers are all top-notch and the cast is excellent. Above all there's just a great energy to it and 'feel good' vibe. There's also of course that great nostalgic touch and 80's feel; if you're a fan of 'THE MUPPETS', at least in their early glory days, you'll definitely like this film. I think the most important compliment to give it is that it's a great family film but it's not dumbed down for the kids; it's still very intelligent and clever. It is possible to make a good kids film and have it be quality entertainment that can entertain adults as well. This is one of those films, it succeeds on almost every level and shouldn't disappoint anyone who knows what to expect; it's 'The Muppets' done right!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXu8bs0LI9A</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yesterday was dad and daughter day and we had a blast! First up was dinner, followed by my daughter's favorite thing to do, SHOPPING! Then, we went to see "The Muppets". An excellent family movie.I have to admit, I felt really old seeing the Muppets again. It wasn't their fault, it's just that until Whoopie and Selena Gomez appeared, the only "Guest Celebrities" I recognized were old guys Mickey Rooney and Alan Arkin. (Jack Black doesn't count, because the second the Muppets saw him in the Anger Management class, they all screamed "There's Jack black!)There was also a couple of things about the movie they should have done differently. I feel if they had done this, then perhaps "The Muppets" would have been a contender for the 2011 Best Picture Oscar. With my tongue planted firmly in my cheek, here are two improvements that would have given Kermit the Oscar:1) Instead of Chris Cooper playing the role of evil Tex Richman with a couple of Muppet sidekicks, give that role to Jeff Dunham, Walter, and Achmed. That would have been past AWESOME! It would have been comic genius! I bet Jeff can dance and... well, I don't know about sing, but I bet he'd make a dang good lip-syncher! But they would have had to name the new Muppet something else... Oh well.2) Yes, Jack Black has somewhat of a reputation as a Hollywood bad boy, but Come On, Admit It! ! You know that role was written for Charlie Sheen!My only SERIOUS complaint about the movie was that I felt the ending was a little too rushed. They had to try to tie up every loose end in the last 5 minutes PLUS the plot carried over into the credits. My daughter really liked it, although I could tell her attention was elsewhere during parts where the focus of the movie was not on the Muppets, but on the romantic side-plot instead. Excellent Movie all the way around and well worth the ticket price. As Siskel and Ebert might have said: "Two Flippers UP!"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was never a big fan of The Muppets, but this movie is special. It gives a nostalgic vibe and an ultimate comeback for the Muppets. I loved the references they made to their TV show, and their previous movies. The jokes were hilarious. The musical numbers were decent. While growing up, Gary and Walter (who is actually a Muppet himself) become obsessed with The Muppets Show. Gary plans a Hollywood Anniversary vacation for his girlfriend, Mary, but Walter comes along too to see the Muppet Theater. When he hears that Tex Richman plans to destroy the theater for oil, Walter tracks down each of the Muppets to help raise #10,000,00 to save the theater and put on the ultimate Muppet Show. Join Kermit, Miss Piggy, Fozzie, Gonzo, Animal, Rowlf, Swedish Chef, Rizzo, and the rest for the biggest comeback in Muppet history. If you grew up with the show, you'll definitely love THE MUPPETS!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More Fun Than You Have the Right to Ask for in a Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I live my life by a simple creed that has worked fairly well for me over the years: anything that involves the Muppets is better than it would be without the Muppets. It's just that simple. If you have a concept, whether it is a film, TV show, or life plan, just add Kermit and I would say your concept will be bettered by a solid 21 percent. Case in point: Muppet Babies: better than regular babies. Babies cry, sleep, and poop all day (says the guy who's a little bit afraid of babies); Muppet Babies, on the other hand, sing, dance, and create glorious imaginary dreamscapes in which they take the form of Star Wars characters. This is a no brainer. Needless to say, I'm a big fan of the Muppets. I don't trust people who don't like the Muppets because, honestly, how is that possible? This seems un-American. I mean, if you don't like the Muppets, I'd expect you're also not such a big fan of apple pie, baseball, and, you know, constitutionalized freedoms. Walter and Gary (Jason Segel) are as close as brothers can be despite their obvious differences. Gary is a near lummox of a man while Walter is a Muppet. Growing up, Walter is obsessed with the Muppets and whenever things get tough, Gary always cheers up his little brother by watching the famous TV show with him. When Gary plans a trip to Los Angeles with his fiance Mary (Amy Adams), he invites Walter along for a tour of the Muppet Studios. But when they get to their destination, Walter finds the studios to be in severe disrepair and completely devoid of Muppets. To make matters worse, he overhears a conversation involving oil tycoon Tex Richman (Chris Cooper) describing his plot to take over the studio and tear it to the ground. Distraught, Walter and Gary track down Kermit the Frog to warn him of the studio's impending doom. With limited funds available, the trio must get the old band back together in order to put together a Muppet telethon to save the studio.From start to finish, The Muppets is about as much fun as you could possibly ask for in a movie. Segel's script (along with the help of Nick Stoller) is a delightfully nostalgic piece of work that not only pays homage to the Muppet way of old but revels in it, making the decidedly retro feel of the film's humor seem like a breath of fresh air. I love sarcasm as much as the next guy but to come across a movie that is genuinely funny without becoming snarky or mean-spirited in the slightest is a rarity these days. At the same time, the vast majority of the bits and jokes aren't near as easy as I thought they might be. Very little within The Muppets is what you would call witty but that doesn't mean it isn't smart; it is just straightforward comedy that should appeal to both adults and children without any problem. The story itself is a simple one as the tale of getting the Muppets back together and putting on one big show takes up the majority of the film's narrative and isn't in and of itself exceedingly original. But as a Muppet fan, it is a narrative that I greatly appreciated and I would imagine that's exactly how Segel felt as he wrote it. I would love for the Muppets to get back together and become relevant again and that's an overriding theme throughout the movie. Segel and director Jason Bobin know that this is somewhat of a last chance for the Muppets as a whole; if this movie succeeds, we'll soon be talking about sequels and a rejuvenation of the Muppet brand; if it fails, Kermit and the gang will be reduced to nothing more than a fond memory that may never again capture the imagination of a generation. This leads to a sort of self- awareness, making The Muppets almost a movie within a movie and that element is one that brought me absolute joy and leads to a number of hilarious moments that had me and the entire audience cackling. In addition, there's an extreme liveliness to The Muppets that I would say bests anything done in the previous Muppet films. As Kermit gets the group back together, we get to see the Muppets at their worst: Fozzy is playing in a cover band (called The Moopets) in Reno, Gonzo has put away the childishness of youth and become a toilet businessman, and Animal is no longer allowed to drum because it triggers his rage. It's cool to see the Muppets in a different setting than we're used to and it makes their final production all the more special. And speaking of the music, each and every number, from the delightful "Man or Muppet" to the shocking- but-hilarious rap song to the inevitable but no less satisfying singing of "The Rainbow Connection", are all exquisite. Bret McKenzie (from Flight of the Conchords) did a masterful job of constructing smart, entertaining songs that both progress the film and stand alone as fun and addicting tunes that will almost certainly pop up on my iPod from time to time. The finished product plays as a Pixar-like version of the Muppets with a little bit of Flight of the Conchords mixed in for good measure (this ingredient should come as no surprise since both Bobin and McKenzie made their names through that show). The Muppets is riotous, uproarious fun and thoroughly refreshing and balances the perfect amount of heart and comedy. It is, in many ways, a passion project and that excitement oozes through in every wonderfully constructed scene. It stands as my favorite film of the year thus far and holds up against any non-animated family film of the last decade (or more).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>American glove puppetry, or Muppets , was long one of the people's primary forms of entertainment. After a lull it is today enjoying a renaissance, sporting new trappings and traveling via new mediums.A bit of background. It is believed glove puppetry first took the stage in China in the early 1300s. Traditional glove-puppet shows were staged on narrow, highly ornamented wooden platforms. They were staged on special days, such as temple openings, birthdays, and during festivals, the point being to thank and honor, through entertainment, the gods that were in attendance and watching over the mortals in attendance. Puppets were about 30 centimeters in height, with small heads and intricately embroidered costumes. Not so, however, since the invention of felt.OK, so "The Muppets" isn't quite as good as back in the day, but it's still a real pleasure, as Kermit and friends move to Texas with the aim of putting on a Broadway show. As with the first two movies, there's lots of musical numbers and some lesser-known famous people in bit parts. Really fun.A better alternative to renting this movie would be to add the first season of the Muppet Show to DVD collection and to stick with watching the Muppet Movie and the Great Muppet Caper...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Once upon a time, before cell phones, DVD, Blu-Ray, even VHS, PS1, PS2, PS3... you get it, before a lot of the stuff we have now, we had The Muppets. But 12 years ago, The Muppets sort of just vanished off the face of the earth. So now, 12 years later, with the magic help of Jason Segel(a huge Muppet fan), the Muppets are back in their prime form in the new film The Muppets, a hilariously charming new film which brings the gang back together for a reunion that was well needed.Segel plays Gary. Gary, with his fianc Mary(the always chipper Amy Adams), and Walter, Gary's brother(a puppet), the #1 Muppet fan, go to see the original Muppet theater. Once there, Walter finds out that Tex Richman(the diabolical Chris Cooper), a tycoon, is going to destroy the theater and dig for oil. So The trio tracks down Kermit the Frog and the rest of the gang in an attempt to save their careers, and their memory.The Muppets is a wonderful film. People can say that they don't like The Muppets, but they would be stupid. These are all characters that we've grown to love. All characters that are fun and funny. It was about time that Kermit, Miss Piggy, Fozzie Bear, Gonzo, Beaker, and the rest of the goofy gang came back.Jason Segel's respect level just boosted in my book. I LOVE how much he loves The Muppets. He loves them so much that he wrote a movie about them, brought them back, and even made a new Muppet character that loves The Muppets. It's really adorable.The songs, such as Man or Muppet, are adorable. Considering that since The Muppets have gone off the face of the earth, we've had movies like Hostel, Saw, Antichrist... movies that have a lot of sex and violence. Don't get me wrong, I like some of those movies. But it's nice to see a nice movie with nice characters.The film stays true to their characters, and the movies. I enjoyed the cameos from Jack Black, Rashida Jones, and Emily Blunt. The film is hilarious and extremely heartfelt. I really loved this film. I hope that this isn't the last we see of them. This is the Muppet film we've waited and deserved.A-</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Nutshell Review: The Muppets</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you're wondering just where the Muppets had disappeared to since it's been decades since my generation had last seen them on our television sets, then this Muppets film will fit right in and address that question, filling us in on just how everyone had past their time in various solo acts. In this sickening age of remakes and reboots, where studio executives wield much power to dictate just what else in the archives could been raided and updated for the modern age, The Muppets avoided this needles path, with Jason Segel, who also has a starring role, and Nicholas Stoller providing a screenplay that continues where we last left off, and fused so much Muppet sensibilities that we pick up from where we last left off, at whichever point that worked for you. And that is pure brilliance.For some reason, Segel's Gary has a brother Walter (voiced by Peter Linz) who's a muppet, and while they are the best of brothers, something's not quite right, but that biological explanation found no room, and got junked from the onset. Not that we're not aware of the acute differences, but seriously you won't be bothered with it. Instead it's sufficient to know that these two are such big fans of The Muppets Show while growing up, that Gary's 10th year anniversary celebration with his girlfriend Mary (Amy Adams) meant a joint trip to Los Angeles, and to visit the studios in which the Muppets Show was shot in.Walter sneaks around, and discovers a diabolical plot by industrialist Tex Richman (Chris Cooper), a man who cannot laugh (and hence ordering his muppet henchmen to do a diabolical/maniacal laugh on his behalf) and having no qualms at demolishing the entire studio because it's sitting on a valuable oil well beneath. So in order to salvage what was his childhood delight, Walter, Gary and Mary look up Kermit the Frog (now voiced by Steve Whitmire, who sounds a little bit different from the Kermit I grew up with) who now has to gather his far flung muppet friends to stage one more Muppet show (what else!) cum telethon to raise $10 million in order to invoke an escape clause of a contract.The Muppets is indeed an extended Muppets Show, and that is such such a delight. Given the musical treatment here, with Jason Segel looking quite awkward and Amy Adams being really at home with her role that calls for an evaluation of her relationship with Gary since her beau is adamant in helping both his brother Walter and the extended Muppets family - Fozzie Bear, Animal, Gonzo, Swedish Chef, Scooter, Miss Piggy of course and the likes - with each given a quick story on what they've been up to, and the rest given the token montage treatment, coupled with the zany Travel By Map technique that just is so hilarious it has to be seen to be believed.In fact, it is precisely this zaniness and craziness that is sorely missed in many recent comedies that had to rely on toilet humour and foul language, that makes The Muppets such a fresh injection of ideas from the days of old, and in some ways instructional to comedic filmmaker wannabes on just how good, clean fun can be achieved. This project to revive the Muppets for the big screen was in good hands from the onset, with director James Bobin having cut his comedic teeth with Da Ali G Show, and The Flight of the Conchords which I rate very highly. Here, the jokes show the kind of wit that was a throwback to the Zucker brothers style, with sight gags and witty dialogue to laugh out loud at, keeping very much as well to the spirit of how it was done in the old Muppet Show days.Then there's that road down memory lane when we actually get to see The Muppet Show in this, with the filmmakers not opting to cheat a little and show a watered down version. There are songs, and there are songs, where under the supervision of Conchords' Bret McKenzie meant quality, as well as the bringing back of notable oldies that will always have a place in any Muppet movie. Mah Nom Mah Nom, anyone?Not forgetting too the nice family friendly messages in the film for the young ones, imparting positive values that any parent will give a nod to. Then there's the bevy of stars appearing in this film, most of them cameo appearances and playing exaggerated versions of themselves or characters they have played in their filmography, with the likes of Jack Black, Rashida Jones, Whoopi Goldberg, Zach Galifianakis, Alan Arkin, Ken Jeong, Emily Blunt, Selena Gomez, Neil Patrick Harris and John Krasinski amongst others, some very fleeting, some without dialogue, but all clearly very game to snag an appearance in a beloved series that still continued to make headway and stay relevant up to this day and age, thanks to the lovely treatment by the filmmakers who stayed true to the spirit of the source material without trying to impose anything too reckless or smart alecky.It's such a fantastic, nostalgic trip brought back to the modern day, that I am not hesitating to put this into the shortlist as one of the best films of this year. This is what we called The Muppet Show! Jim Henson would have been proud of this effort! Highly recommended!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Muppets is a fantastic film with a very well developed storyline and a superb cast and characters. It is a very sweet, funny and true comeback for the Muppets and I think all fans, old and new, will be impressed, it has beautiful new songs, memorable quotes and also some great new characters. I did feel like it revolved around Jason Segel and Amy Adams too much, though I do like both of these actors, their characters were too developed, the humans need to be secondary to the Muppets at all times. The films soundtrack is superb, with songs like Man or Muppet and Life's a Happy Song becoming instant classics, this is one of the best Muppet movies there's been in years. Funny, heartwarming and true to the characters, I would highly recommend the Muppets for the whole family. When Walter,Gary and Mary go to Hollywood and visit the Muppets old studio, they discover a wealthy man is plotting to shut the studio down to find oil underneath the building. The only way they can stop him is if The Muppets can raise $10,000,000, they meet Kermit and try to reunite the old gang. Best Performance: Chris Cooper Worst Performance: Ken Jeong</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Muppets" manages to offer something to all ages which they can all enjoy together. This film just gives you such a positivity and an uplifting feeling because of the amazing characters and the beautiful connection they all have. The editing was brilliant in the film, in terms of how they spoofed various editing techniques. For example, to recruit all the Muppet's instead of individually gathering them one of the characters offers to finish the job by using a montage, also to travel long distances they keep referring to travelling "by map" (like they do in Indiana Jones etc.) and how they keep saying how they have had to sing a song about a various situation. It just felt like they weren't taking themselves to seriously and it was light-hearted in everything they did. The leading characters: Jason Segel, Amy Adams and new edition Walter did an amazing job at keeping spirits up and giving really enjoyable performances. Of course, the Muppet's themselves have to be applauded. I loved how they explored Kermits and Miss Piggys relationship like a proper modern day relationship, it was very very humorous. I felt like Disney really gave everything to this project, it was well thought through in how they addressed the Muppet's decline in popularity and how they were going to revive themselves in the public's perception of them. This film wasn't a cop out film, a film just to make money, it felt like this was a story that needed to be told and that leaves the door open for many new and fresh Muppet's adventures.</fullReview>

My husband isn't a musical lover, but he loved just seeing the old gang and being able to see his children's faces. Our kids have already been introduced to the Muppets, as we own all of them on DVD now, and they are still talking about them kidnapping Jack Black, since they know him from his cameos in other kids shows. Myself, I am excited to find that everyone was still basically the same and Kermmy and Piggie still loved each other. This movie made me remember all the feelings I had when watching them as a child.

		<fullReview>The muppets haven't been in the theatrical realm since 1999&#x2032;s flop Muppets from Space and since then they've been reduced to TV movies at best which has left them to fade away into the memory of their now grown up audience. In a fairly daring, but brilliant move Disney finally decided to utilize the muppets property which they acquired over ten years ago to try to rekindle the grown muppets audience as well as bring them to a new generation of viewers. The Muppets promises fun for both the old and the young with plenty of nods to the classic series as well as enough fun gags to hold the attention of this younger generation of viewer. The danger with doing this type of nostalgic throwback movie is that so many movies have failed in the past(Alvin and the Chipmunks, Yogi Bear, The Smurfs) which puts the Muppets in a tough spot. Like these other throwback films The Muppets includes several celebrity cameos as well as a few musical dance numbers. Can the Muppets bring back this memorable and charming cast of characters or does it fall into the same rut as most of the other retro TV show turned movie films?Read the rest at: http://wp.me/p1tyJd-6m</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have loved the Muppets since I was a kid, watching the TV shows with great enthusiasm. While I liked the movies like "Muppets Treasure Island" and "Muppets Christmas Carol", I had longed for a return to the variety act type show I remembered as a kid.This movie did not disappoint. It was right back to the same style and feeling of the original show. All the old characters that we loved were there. It all begins when the Muppet Theatre is slated for demolition and the evil buyer (Chris Cooper) is going to use the area to drill for oil. The Muppets have to come together for a telethon to raise the money to save their old theater. Over the years, the Muppets have all gone their own ways and are doing their own things. Kermit and his friends (Amy Adams and Jason Segal along with a new Muppet) are on the hunt to unite the old gang. Of course the hilarity ensues.Memorable moments for me were Chris Cooper rapping about destroying The Muppet Theatre and The Chickens clucking out Cee Lo Green's "Forget You".All around, this movie delivered and I was not disappointed. It will delight kids that have never seen the Muppets before and please old fans.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best film of 2011</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Muppets are my childhood in a nutshell; I was raised on reruns of The Muppet Show and Muppet Babies. This new film was a flashback to my past, and I loved it. The genuinely happy, funny, and little bit dramatic musical that I know any Muppet fan would love is finally here. Of course, the film has a fair amount of cameo celebrities, including, but not limited to, Neil Patrick Harris, Whoopi Goldberg, Sarah Silverman, and Jack BlackWalter is a Muppet, well, more like a puppet not officially christened a Muppet, whose best friend and brother figure is the human Gary (Jason Segel). The two grew up together in Smalltown, USA, through school, boy scouts, and reruns of The Muppet Show. Now Gary is a 30-something guy who's spent the last 10 years with his high school sweetheart Mary (Amy Adams). Mary's waiting for the day Gary proposes to her, and the two are planning a trip to Los Angeles, but Mary is a tad hesitant that Walter's coming along.When the trio arrive in LA and visit the famous Muppet Studio, they find that the Studio is abandoned and no one cares enough for the Muppets anymore. Walter wanders away from Gary and Mary into Kermit the Frog's old office and learns of oil tycoon Tex Richman's (Chris Cooper) evil plan to tear down the Studio for the oil underneath. Walter tells Gary and Mary that they need to find Kermit and raise the $10 million needed to stop the destruction. The three find Kermit's house and inform him of the plan. Kermit is a little uncertain because he hasn't seen any of the others in years. Walter eventually convinces Kermit to reunite the Muppets to save the Studio.What ensues is getting the gang back together: Fozzie is working as a sleazy bar entertainer (just like in "The Muppet Movie"), Gonzo is a powerful plumbing magnate, Animal is in an anger management clinic with his mentor Jack Black, and Miss Piggy is a plus-size Vogue editor in Paris. "Traveling by map" (the screen becomes an atlas and a line journeys across the waters to Cannes, and the car comes out of the water), the gang tries to convince Miss Piggy to return, who, still bitter after a particular argument with Kermit years before, reluctantly agrees.The Muppets is the perfect family comedy for the 2011 holiday season. Muppet classics like "Rainbow Connection" and "Mahna Mahna" return, along with new songs written by Flight of the Concords' Bret McKenzie and writer/star Jason Segel; one of which is a rap performed by Chris Cooper. It is the ultimate musical comedy and probably the best film I've seen in 2011.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Reminder Of Just Why We Have Always Loved The Muppets</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's no denying that many of us who grew up with The Muppets loved them. From Kermit's bubbly optimism and leadership to Miss Piggy's independent attitude and all the other fuzzy, hilarious friends in between, The Muppets were a stretch of the imagination that brought laughter and smiles to people's faces on a regular basis. But, as tends to happen with these things, Kermit and the rest kind of fell by the wayside. People forgot about them. Interest in the puppets was lost. The new Muppets film, simply titled The Muppets, takes this to heart and reminds us, like some long lost memory, why we fell in love with them in the first place.We find our favorite frog and his friends having moved on with their life. Kermit is living in a mansion in LA, Miss Piggy is fashionista running a company, Gonzo runs a plumbing magnate, and Fozzy Bear is working in Reno for a casino. Times are tough. But an intrepid couple of brothers, one human, one Muppet, have set out to reunite them and win them back their theater, which is being targeted by an oil magnate attempting to buy it out. While the story may not be anything too original, it's the execution that carries the film. Everything we've always loved is here, from the song and dance numbers to the irreverent humor.Overall, the film is pretty darn goofy, but it works to the films favor. The Muppets have always been goofy, and that shines here, with plenty of breaking the fourth wall and poking fun of cinema conventions. There's a certain magic to the silliness of the film and you can't help but smile and laugh when you see these classic characters break into their usual routine of jokes and inspirational messages. Despite how over the top the film can get oftentimes, whereas in other films it might not resonate, here it's a strength. Not everyone will get into it. The humor here may not be for everyone. But for those of us that grew up with The Muppets, and for those that like their humor silly, you will find a lot to like about The Muppets, not the least of which is Jason Siegel and Amy Adams, who are perfectly cast as the equally silly and adorable human couple.The magic we once knew of The Muppets is perfectly translated here and it's great to see our friends at it once again. Nostalgia most certainly plays a factor, but beyond that, The Muppets is a fun, silly, entertaining film for anyone looking to have a good time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One expects a film that's a cut above from the most famous collective creation of Jim Henson. For all that The Muppets tries all sorts of different twists on the reunion gig genre though, we can see them coming. Adults groan at the in- and meta-jokes. For example Chris Cooper's pantomime baddie shouts out 'maniacal laugh!' in place of laughing and montage or illustrated sequences are introduced self-consciously as such. The puppets themselves are an undying source of fun but the children in my screening seemed strangely unmoved. Perhaps there was too much nostalgia, or too much interaction with adults, period.It's slick but professionalism doesn't take the place of the magic (we see a tantalising glimpse of Peter Sellars on the original Muppet Show early on). Adult cameos are averagely taken, Emily Blunt's reprisal of her secretary to Piggy's Streep/Wintour a particularly flat case-in-point. Worst of all, the songs are largely not just uninspired but poor. The best part of the cinema experience was the excellent prior Toy Story short. 4/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have a lot more respect for Jason Segal after seeing this film. Not only was he a good actor in support of the Muppets (which is pretty rare in their earlier films) but he also co-wrote and was an executive producer for the movie! Clearly, this must have been a labor of love for this "Freaks and Geeks" alumnus. Good job, Jason.While I would not say that anything about the film was brilliant, it was exceptionally good throughout--and better than I'd expected. It managed to successfully combine LOTS of sentiment and humor--something that rarely comes off well. I think this was because more than any Muppet film ever, the film was VERY tongue-in-cheek and OFTEN stepped outside the 4th wall. In other words, it often parodied itself and the genre--and did so with a wink. For example, after performing a long and silly song and dance number, Segal tells his girlfriend (Amy Adams) about his day--and mentions how tired he is after that song and dance number! Cute.As for the characters, most all of them are back--but with new voices since the puppeteers have either died or retired. Most are very close to the originals (particularly Kermit) but a couple are a bit off (Fozzy). But, the ACT like the original characters--and that is very important. And, frankly, it's much better than many of the earlier Muppet films. Cleverly written, touching--particularly the "Rainbow Connection" number which had me and my daughter in tears (particularly for my daughter, who was born the day Jim Henson died--and this really had an impact on her as she heard the song originally sung in "The Muppet Movie"). By the way, this earlier film is the only Muppet film, in my opinion, that might be better than "The Muppets". The new one is that good and that enjoyable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>In these hands, the Muppets make a pitch-perfect comeback</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Forget former child stars and D-list celebrities, The Muppets needed a comeback more than any of them. Heck, we needed them. We live in glum times, people. Optimism seems about as trendy as boy bands these days. Maybe that's why Jim Henson's beloved creatures disappeared in the first place: The world disregarded the sense of unabashed silliness that they embodied for 30-some years in exchange for ideals such as progressiveness and "edutainment."The wayward trajectory of the Muppets in the 21st Century definitely fueled the fire for Disney's "reboot." Art imitates life here as "The Muppets" focuses on bringing the gang back together and ultimately defying those who believe there's no longer a place for the kind of entertainment and energy they bring.It only takes moments, however, to realize their place in all-ages entertainment stands eternal. Nostalgia covers this film like a warm ? felt ? blanket. The Muppets have returned and hopefully for good.Co-writer and star Jason Segel must've realized in no time that the idea of the Muppets drifting apart spoke quite directly to the themes that the various shows and movies of the last 40 years have championed. To represent the lifelong fan spurned by Jim Henson Company's inability to make the Muppets relevant in today's age, Segel and Nicholas Stoller create Walter, the first truly humanoid Muppet, though his fuzzy nature is seen as something that simply makes him "different than all the other kids." When he first sees the Muppets as a child, he becomes their biggest fan.Walter travels with his older (human) brother, Gary (Segel) and Gary's girlfriend of 10 years, Mary (Amy Adams), to Los Angeles to visit the old Muppet theater. After sneaking into Kermit's old office, Walter learns of an evil plan by oil tycoon Tex Richman (Chris Cooper), who plans to knock the theater down to drill for oil. He convinces Gary and Mary to help him warn the Muppets so that they can band together and put on a show to raise the money needed to save the theater."The Muppets" features countless easter eggs for those who enjoyed the Muppets as children and now have children, while remaining simple and innocent enough in delivery to be loved by said children. It's also extremely faithful to the silly and musical nature of the brand, but with the self-awareness necessary to be a hit with folks of all ages of "the Modern era." One of the funniest bits is when the Muppets learn Miss Piggy currently resides in Paris and determine the fastest way to travel there is "by map." This, of course, refers to the movie convention of showing lines moving across a map to demonstrate a major change in a story's location. Where once was a flaw in logic/realism becomes a hilarious joke. Wocka-wocka.A similar attitude is taken toward the musical numbers. "Life's A Happy Song," the first major number, exudes "Muppets" catchiness despite all its corniness, while the simplistic emotionally soul-bearing ballads the brand has been most known for (such as "Rainbow Connection," which gets its own spotlight) show up too. There's the hilarious yet deeply felt "Man or Muppet," in which we see both a Muppet version of Segel and a human version of Walter (a cameo of course ? you'll be amused). Like any musical, the songs work best when they naturally fit in with the story. Also, Oscar nominee Chris Cooper raps. I'll leave it at that.The many cameos are befitting a "Muppet" movie, but the humans never dominate; that would not be true to the mission of the entire film. As perfect as Segel and Adams are for their roles, this movie stars Walter, Kermit, Miss Piggy, Animal (hysterical) among the many others. One almost wishes there could have been more screen time given to some of the memorable Muppets not named Kermit, Miss Piggy, Gonzo or Fozzie. Personally, some more Bunson and Beaker would've been nice. Hopefully this is sequel fodder.At the same time, part of what makes this movie excellent is the way it uses nostalgia and rallies around the idea that the Muppets should never be forgotten. The story works perfectly in context, but as such it's not one that can be replicated in future films. It will take some more outside-the-box thinking to keep the Muppets on this roll, but no doubt "The Muppets" will spur on some kind of long-term plan for these beloved characters whether in more films or back to television again.~Steven CVisit my site, moviemusereviews.com!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A bit overrated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really thought that I would love this film given all it's critical acclaim. I had a lot of time to think about this one over the last 2 days and how honest I wanted to be about this film. I can't say that it really took my breath away as much as I had hoped, but overall, I did end up liking it more than I disliked it. I do think that over half the songs didn't really work and felt incredibly awkward. Some of the cameo's here are really what made the film for me. One fellow critic here states "A rapping Chris Cooper takes uncomfortable awkwardness to a whole new level" . This statement is about as true as it gets. Also, the small part with Alan Arkin really felt quite depressing as for a number of other scenes in the film with the Muppets themselves. It seemed the Muppets spent most of the time being quite mopey, while it was the new characters that brought life to the film and brought something joyful to it. There is also a new Muppet in here which I don't recall from the past who is basically a trans gender version of Miss Piggy. This I found to be a bit disturbing to say the least. Some may find it funny, but I found it to be really out of place in this film.If you're a huge fan of the Muppets, this is a must-see, and in all honesty, I have been quite a huge fan of the Muppets in the past, and perhaps I need to do some re-watching of the old material to acquire more appreciation for this one. However, after seeing this, I can't say that my fandom has grown at all, and honestly, I can see this going down in history as one of the most overrated films of 2011. But thats me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>All right, I loved it in this movie when the Muppets did a great rendition of their trademark song "The Rainbow Connection", I always enjoy watching Jack Black and he has a wonderfully funny cameo as the celebrity host and I thought that Fozzie's fart shoes were cool. However, there was little to nothing else I liked in this yawner of a film. I write this negative review with a heavy heart because I grew up loving Sesame Street and The Muppet Show and the 1979 Muppet Movie. I was hoping to feel a rush of joy and nostalgia when the movie started however I was just mostly bored to tears, maybe I'm just getting old and grumpy. The magic just isn't there anymore. There were several songs in this film and all of them just fell flat as a pancake. There was one song called Are You A Man Or A Muppet that just about sent me screaming out of the cinema!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Incredibly silly humor coupled with a boring story - this, from the perspective of a 28yo guy.Not worth the time.For a children's movie, it did have some unnecessary violent scenes. Displaying to children that problems could be solved through the use of violence.There was also some blatant product placement in the movie, which I found to be quite shameful considering it's a children's movie (Coca Crapa, Red bullsh*t etc).Peace</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Muppets are making a comeback.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is by far the best I have seen all year. It has a lot of humor in it ( a lot that appeals to the older viewer as the Muppet have never been just for children). The new character both human and Muppets (Walter is amazing) have a lot of heart to them. THis will be the first movie in over ten years that I will happily see more than once in theaters. It is a very emotional movie that makes us feel for these characters made of felt. The music is very memorable too. Jason Seagal is very clearly a Muppet fan, and you can tell by watching this film that all involved wanted to capture and preserve the old Muppet magic from the time of Jim Henson. This is by far my favorite Muppet movie since the Great Muppet Caper. The Muppets are back and hopefully we will see more in the future.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not at all what I had hoped for...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really, really, really wanted to like this movie. I love the Muppets, and Jason Segal is a talented guy who also really loves the Muppets. They had everything there for a great film, and somehow it just fell apart. The start was cute, the middle was numbing, and the end was not great. It dragged. In some places it really dragged. And the end was anti-climactic.I have to place this firmly at the feet of the director and the producers. This is the directors first feature length film. Up to this point he has been directing episodic cable television programs (The Conchords and Da Ali G Show). It's hard to move between the mediums of TV and film, as well as between the genres of semi-adult TV comedy and family movie. I have to say I more blame the producers (and Disney) for letting this director cut his feature length teeth on something as big as the Muppets on his first try.I recommend waiting for it to hit cable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Careful. This review contains Tears of Joy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm a man. I promise.I think my recliner's dusty, because I was tearing up something fierce during The Muppets.I know I'm a hardcore softy, but I was really touched by this movie.The Muppets, as always, is a self-referential tale. The plot reflects the current state of the Muppet tradition in reality.The last time Jim Henson's puppets had an adventure was back in 2005, with a movie I've never heard of. The Muppets' Wizard of Oz stars Ashanti, Queen Latifah and Quentin Tarantino; one of the most baffling casts in an apparent attempt to retell the classic tale in an African American context. It was clearly a major flop.This current escapade is their attempt to revive the classic mode of storytelling.What's most fascinating about this franchise is its own brand of narrative. It's a cast of characters that a large audience feels nostalgia for. And it's a romp through self-awareness. The plot (although particularly strong in this feature) is almost inconsequential because it's just another mode through which the Muppet experience is retold.I think it's rare we get to see the full performance of The Muppet Show. By this film's end, it delivers the whole shebang-a-bang.Jason Segel plays a big part in getting this film made, because he not only stars, but also is the top-billed screenwriter (besides Jim Henson.) The puppeteer died in 1990 at only fifty-four years old, so it's doubtful he had a hand in writing this screenplay. But it's nice to see them remembering his name.Henson produced a philosophical teleplay in 1969 titled The Cube. It's tells a smart and funny story in just under an hour and is worth a watch. (It's online, you'll find it.) But he wrote, directed and produced all sorts of stuff, like The Cube, which are both brilliant and completely devoid of puppets. He was a true talent that passed before his time.Also starring in the film is Amy Adams, who may be the best actress working today. She's top three for certain (along with Jennifer Lawrence and Scarlett Johansen).Fun fact: Segel and Kermit recorded a video (which can be found online as well) asking Amy to costar. Clearly she accepted, she's a delight and even dances (and potentially sings, I can't find confirmation though!)Now I don't like to talk about myself, but I think my experience with the Muppets is one people can connect with. Before watching the 2011 movie, I've never seen a Muppet adventure in full. I've watched the 3D experience at Disney World several times, but that's about it.I went into the film with an expectation of disappointment. Which can only mean my reaction is bolstered by that bias. At worst, it's a good movie, not a great movie.But I'm writing this review several days later, and even with a level head I believe it deserves all four stars.It seems to be enjoyable to everyone.I want somebody to look me in the eye while they proclaim hatred for the Muppets. I'm not sure it's possible.So after that heap of praise, let's discuss what doesn't work.I thought the budget was pretty small because, well, they say so in the movie. Fozzie Bear makes a comment about how he's surprised they could afford an explosion with the budget. (IMDB estimates it around $45M, which doesn't seem all that shallow to me.)But when you think about it their machine involves a lot of moving pieces, including a bevy of backup dancers, seat-filling extras, music composition, an orchestral performance (I'm assuming), etc.And as soon as he said that, I started noticing ways in which they may have cut corners. For example, the 'muppet man' gag is oddly poor in comparison to the rest of the film. It's not painfully long, and the film's so self-referential, it allows forgiveness for certain weaknesses in the narrative.The slowest parts of the movie are, as always, any moment focused around Miss Piggy. I don't care what anyone says, Miss Piggy is by far the most boring Muppet!She always has been. I don't understand why this problem still exists. People like to paraphrase to me, "Well, she's supposed to be played in opposition to the other characters. She's written to be cringe-worthy."Well, okay, that doesn't detract from my point that Miss Piggy has proved to be boring, regardless of the writing's intent. Regardless of the source material she's satirizing, or the dichotomies drawn between her and other Muppets; scenes and music solos featuring Miss Piggy aren't enjoyable, therefore can't we cut down on her screen time?Sorry. That swine really sets me off.I generally dislike scatological humor. And if you'd asked me ahead of time, I would have agreed with the puppeteers, that Fozzie Bear's 'fart shoes' would be lowbrow.But they aren't over-the-top, cheesy or stupid. In fact, it's one of the funniest gags in the film. Which is exemplary of all the humor in The Muppets: It's fast-paced and calculated.The soundtrack, written by Bret McKenzie (famously from TV's Flight of the Concords) is excellent. Even Chris Cooper's rap number (which gets glossed over) is good. The best is "Man or Muppet" which is quite brilliant, and fun.The cameos are thoroughly delightful."The Rainbow Connection" is a part I'm roaring to dislike. But I surrendered, there's some crying involved, I don't want to talk about it.Overall, The Muppets is a fantastic movie that doesn't get its due. Give it a try, and you'll be glad you did!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's about time!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first heard the news about it, I was excited. It is one of these things that deserve a comeback. I grew up with them when I was a kid, their films range from charming and cute to silly and wacky. This film made me think about the past films. Such as how they got back together. I would not give anything away, but there is a certain song, that is sad, but the lyrics cannot be heard and with a straight face. The musical number cannot be seen with a straight face. In other words it will put you in hysterics! I will give you a clue, it won an Oscar for Best Original Song. When most people hear about the Muppets, they say that it is infantile (because something like "Sesame Street" comes to mind), but this one isn't! This is because of the writing, humor, pop-culture references and interesting characters that made it so lovable. I highly recommend it because it is a breath of fresh air! Why did I say that? Because when I go to the movies, I go there for a good reason, to get the mind off the horrors and stresses of everyday life. Movies that exploit 9-11, the war on terror and the economy gone downhill, doesn't help because they bring in more stress! It doesn't insult anybody's intelligence in a nasty manner, it does it in a playful and happy manner rather than a nasty manner. There is nothing negative, no messed-up story-lines, no grating ear and eye-sores. It is pure fun. The thing is, it is rated PG for mild language, if they didn't use profanity in one scene, then it would get a G-rating like the previous films. Bottom line: Fun for the whole family? Yes! So give it a watch. This has been another "Matthew Praises."</fullReview>

Anyway, "The Muppets" is the first Muppet movie i ever saw i theaters and it was special. I had a blast, it had the feel of the show and the movies, with the corny humor and the charm. I like the new character Walter. The human characters are pretty funny. I only had a problem with the one song they did and the was the song "F**k you" or in the movie its "Forget You" for censorship reasons. The Muppet's can't do songs like that. I definitely did enjoy this one. and i can't wait for the sequel</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Can You Spell Awesome!!! (IMDb won't let me "shout" in the Summary)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Due to the past productions the Muppets released, I was not at all excited when I heard they were coming out with another theatrical film. I just knew it would be crap, and that "Green With Envy" teaser confirmed what I believed! (You know, the one where Jason Segal looks in the camera and asks "Are there Muppets in this movie?") I was not impressed! But after it came out and EVERYBODY began praising it - including everyone around me - I agreed to sit down and watch it. What did I think?...CAN YOU SPELL AWESOME!!! This movie was nothing like I thought it would be, and was everything I wanted to see in their past productions! I'll try to be brief here, but know it will be hard!I do have a few problems with the movie, and I'll start with those first since I have a lot of things I love about this film. First, I wish I had seen more of some of the Muppets. We saw Gonzo for about 25% of the film, and I wanted more of him. I saw Rizzo in 2 shots, and wanted more of him! He didn't get any lines! I read that a cameo was written for Elmo, but Sesame Workshop wouldn't let him be used; I was greatly disappointed by that! True, Pepe appears in the film, but, thankfully, he only has 3 lines! Anytime I look at a poster or picture of this movie, I hate looking at the "Disney" name; it still bothers me that the Muppets are owned by Disney. To be honest, I don't like Jason Segal's acting here. I can't say he's a bad actor because I've never seen him in anything else (I haven't even heard of him before this movie). Maybe this is just a new form of entertainment for him. Finally, some people were a little upset with the ending. It led up to be a mature ending, but the Muppets get everything back during the credits. I do understand they had to get their stuff back - what would they have been called if they didn't get their name back; they reference their productions all the time! But to have it rushed like that during the credits is a bit sloppy. That's all my bad stuff, but all of those are really, really minor problems.I LOVE EVERYTHING ELSE! While I'm not fond of Jason Segal's acting here, I love the man and his writing partner for bringing the Muppets back in the form we remember them! This movie is comedy gold! I can't think of a joke in this movie that doesn't work! I especially love when they reference their older productions, like when Sweetums runs down the street from Mad Monty's, or Beauregard's return! Richman's "Maniacal Laugh" is the funniest villain laugh ever in film! I love Rowlf's return here! It's so classic!Not only is the movie insanely funny, but it's also very touching and heartfelt! Other Muppet movies and moments have been heartfelt in the past, but this film takes it to a whole new level for them! The scene where Kermit walks down the hallway in his house and sees the pictures of his friends is a huge tear jerker. Another great emotional moment is when the Muppets sing "The Rainbow Connection" in their telethon - especially when Animal begins playing his drums again! We also feel for the Muppets when Kermit makes his speech after the telethon, and we celebrate with them when they go outside and hear people cheer their names!The songs are really awesome! Bret McKenzie has become the new Paul Williams of Muppet songs, he captures the tone and moments just right! These songs are both hilarious and emotional. I also jam to "Me Party" when I hear it; "Man or Muppet" is just great; and I was shocked and upset about Richman's rap when I first saw the movie, but I love it now!I read that there was some controversy among some of the Muppet performers about this movie. One of the things they didn't like was the joke with Fozzie's fart shoes. On one hand, I'm glad that they finally took a stand after ALL of their past bad productions. But, when you think about it...they had ALL of those bad productions! They hated Fozzie's fart shoes, but had no problem with "The Muppets' Wizard of Oz?!?" REALLY?!? Need I remind you all that Fozzie and Gonzo used to make jokes about whoopee cushions - and that was while Jim Henson was alive!...But I digress.I can't say too much because this space does not allow me. This is just a too good, too wonderful movie! I love it! I'm excited about their sequel, but I don't think it could be as big as this film because this was their comeback...But we'll see. Thank you to everyone who was apart of this movie to make it as great as it was, especially Jim Henson for the spirit and characters this movie has, and to Jason Segal and Nicholas Stoller for giving us the spirit and characters back! You'll love this film, I promise you! BOOYIKA!P.S. I love that teaser now!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Now This Is How Studios Should Make Reboots!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It seems like everything is being rebooted in this day and age and the Muppets are no exception. I remember watching the originals as a child and I loved them. I was skeptical when I heard they were doing a reboot but I should not have been. This movie is one of the best reboots I have seen lately. It captures the magic and charm that existed in the first few films. I loved the songs that were sung including the original song, "Man or Muppet." James Bobin's film starts off with us getting to know a puppet named Walter who lives with his human friend,Gary. They both stumble upon an evil plot by an oil tycoon while visiting the Muppet Studio. Walter and Gary decides to get the Muppets together once more in order to save their studio.The acting is really good. This film is filled with so many surprising cameos, so be prepared for many familiar faces. Jason Segel as Gary really surprised me on how good he was. That guy can also sing well. Amy Adams is charming as she always is. Chris Cooper has some memorable scenes as the villain. And we cannot forget the wonderful voices of the Muppets.Overall, this is a charming film that is great to sing along with and it brought back some wonderful childhood memories. This is the perfect film to introduce new fans too. I really hope the sequel is just as good because this movie has certainly made the Muppets popular again. I rate this film 9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Great Recreation Of Jim Henson's Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Muppets is a musical comedy film that features Jason Segel, Amy Adams, Chris Cooper, and Rashida Jones.In the film, Walter, a devoted Muppet fan, his brother Gary, and Gary's girlfriend Mary help Kermit the Frog reunite the Muppets. They must raise funds to save the Muppet Theater from Tex Richman, a businessman who plans to demolish the studio to drill for oil.This film is the first Muppets theatrical release in twelve years.It is directed by James Bobin.Walter lives with his human brother Gary in Smalltown. They became Muppet fans when they watched The Muppet Show in their youth. Gary plans a vacation to Los Angeles with his girlfriend, Mary to celebrate their tenth anniversary, inviting Walter along so he can tour the Muppet Studios. Mary feels that Gary's devotion to Walter is detracting from their relationship.In Los Angeles, the three visit the abandoned Muppet Studios. During the tour, Walter sneaks into Kermit the Frog's office and discovers Statler and Waldorf selling the theater to an oil magnate named Tex Richman and his henchmen Bobo the Bear and Uncle Deadly. Waldorf explains that if the Muppets can raise $10 million they can repurchase the theater. The Muppets are back, just like we remember them, with catchy tunes and meta humor. Also, a great cast of cameo appearances is paired with a fun story and iconic characters that haven't been detrimentally modernized.It not only lives up to the franchise legacy and, for some, might just end up being one of their all-time favorite adventures with Kermit and the gang.Overall,it's lovely, joyful, wonderful and sweet, and the happy-happy goodwill is so infectious, you'll finish the film, maybe not believing that muppets are real as manages to revitalize the family classic to create a hilarious and life-affirming delight.Truly a great recreation of Jim Henson &amp; Friends's classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Muppets ? TRASH IT "Unless you're not a Muppeteer" (C+) The Muppetts are famous and I believe everyone in the world have seen them in their childhood. They defiantly have significant part in growing up. Now finally after long efforts of Jason Segel and Nicolas Stroller they pull off a movie about the Muppeteer. The story and everything is pretty good and work perfectly for the Muppets but as a grown man watching the movie was a terrible experience. I do like a good children movie with some humor but this one went too far with music and honestly there was nothing funny about it. Jason Segel, Amy Adams and all Muppets team did a great job but sadly I'm not an audience for it. Special appearance by Emily Blunt, Selena Gomes, Zach Galifianakis, Whoopi Goldberg, Alan Arkin, Jim Parsons, Rico Rodriguez and John Krasinski were alright. So, if you're not a Muppeteer then simply Trash it.</fullReview>

However, she's not a HUGE fan of the Muppet characters like the two main characters of this new movie.The Muppets take place sort of a direct sequel years later after The Muppets Take Manhattan movie in which the characters have moved on and drifted apart (Fozzie does a lounge act in Reno, NV and Animal is taking anger management classes, for example) ...going their own separate ways. The basic theme of this movie in the beginning - the world has moved on and have forgotten about them but they're not definitely forgotten especially not with their two BIGGEST fans - Walter (a Muppet) and human brother Gary (Jason Segel of CBS' How I Met Your Mother, a television program that prides itself with nostalgia) of Smalltown, USA. Like SouthSide, they grew up watching the Muppets and Muppet Show and now as adults, they're taking a trip to Hollywood to tour the famous Muppet studio and theater. Coming along with them is Gary's girlfriend of 10 years (now, you know there's a major snag in the relationship if you still dating a guy for 10 years with no intention of marriage ...yet), Mary (Amy Adams) who's "excited" that brother Walter is tagging along on their anniversary trip. Yet like in any Muppet movie, there's a bad guy and/or a problem which involves the Muppet characters raising money to save their theater from destruction. In this latest Disney-produced version movie, the baddie is a rich oil tycoon (a BP reference?) named Tex Richman (wonderfully played by Chris Cooper) who will own not only the studio but also the Muppet name if the lovable characters don't raise the necessary 10 million (yes, this time it's in the millions, folks) dollars by midnight (always by midnight with the Muppets) according to the ironclad contract Kermit signed long ago. So with the help of Walter and Gary, Kermit gets the old gang back together for one last show however not everyone (Miss Piggy) isn't on board at first. But, hey, this is the Muppet movie - everyone re-unites to help save their name and studio.SouthSide liked the fact Disney cracked opened the vaults and re-united ALL of the muppets from The Muppet Show (including Beauregard the janitor, Sweetums - still working at the same used car dealership from the original Muppet Movie, Uncle Deadly - used when Vincent Price made his appearance on the show and more) for the making of this movie. Who knows when we'll ever see them on the big screen and on television again? Also like any Muppet-involved movie there's a long list of A-list celebrities with cameo or speaking appearances like Alan Arkin (the tour guide), Emily Blunt (as Miss Piggy's executive assistant), Mickey Rooney (as a Smalltown, USA resident) and some corny Muppet songs to fill the movie's run time such as Life Is Happy and Me Party of One songs. However also included within this soundtrack was few 80s hits like Jefferson Airplane's We Built This City and Gary Neuman's Car ...even AC/DC gets inside a Muppet movie during a montage sequence. Yet, her favorite song from this movie would have to be Tex Richman's hilarious hiphop/rap ditty about himself ...she would like to dedicate it to her BP (executive) fianc. Plus there were other references from other Muppet movies of the past (i.e. Rainbow Connection and Together Again ...and other non-song references) intricately placed throughout the movie. And stick around during the credits for the Mah Na Mah Na song too.What this reviewer liked about this new Muppet movie was they aged the Muppet characters a little (i.e. check out the graying on Fozzie's eyebrows) and it was nice to know that happy wedding endings don't last forever especially between a frog and a pig. And this time, the Muppets don't technically win - they actually can lose graciously to the big evil oilman Richman even though the ending does suggest they've won. What she didn't like about this movie - Disney re-manufactured the same Muppet movie formula i.e. defeat the bad guy by putting on a show to raise the money necessary to save the theater to play it safe with audiences. If the muppets can grow old, so can the tiresome formula. For the next movie - get more creative, writers, especially for this new millennial generation.Overall, it's worth the price of the movie ticket to see all of the Muppets together again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The best way to see a good movie is to go into it knowing as little about it as you can so I try not to include details about the movies in my reviews. If the movie sucks then I'm not shy about including details and/or spoilers.I loved the Muppet show as a child but this was my first time watching a Muppet movie and I must say I enjoyed it. I'm not a big fan of musicals so the song numbers in the movie did bug me but the rest of the movie overshadowed that horror so it is all good. In fact, I thought I was going to hate this movie because it starts off with some crappy song number but once you see the frog this movie gets going. I also love the fact that this movie is aimed at people that grew up in the 80s, I got a kick out of that. 80s Robot rocks, btw.. you'll see. This is just a warm and fuzzy joyfest of a movie. You'll love it. I hope they don't make a sequel to this, at least not for a while. Are the Muppets back? The answer is yes however the question is do we want them to stick around? I say that because this movie is more or less about a bunch of old friends coming together to do something or other however they are older and wiser. Funny how a Muppets movie can be so emotional but that is why this movie was so engaging.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The funny and fuzzy sensation of a generation returns for one last hurrah in "The Muppets", a warm hearted musical comedy that acts less like a brand relauncher and more like a grand final act to a classic franchise. For years, the Muppets have appeared in TV holiday specials and movies but this movie returns to the original series that first jumpstarted the Muppes to fame: the 1976 Muppets Show. Self referencing humor, witty comedy and familiar characters pay the ultimate tribute not just to a well loved franchise but to the Muppets fandom as well. Why else would the main character be a muppet fanboy? Meet Walter, the ultimate muppet fanboy (who is also portrayed as a muppet) who lives with his human brother Gary in "Smalltown" USA. The two grew up together and have been fans of the muppets ever since The Muppet show first aired in the 70s. One day Gary plans a trip to Los Angeles with his girlfriend Mary. Walter jumps at the opportunity to tag along and visit the muppet theatre, much to the dismay of Mary who was hoping for some private time with her boyfriend. But instead of seeing the muppet theatre of his childhood, Walter comes face to face with harsh reality: the muppets have disbanded, the theatre is in ruins and a greedy tycoon is looking to buy the location and tear down the place of Walter's childhood dreams. Undaunted, Walter tries to reunite the Muppets for one final show in order to raise the money needed to buy back the theatre.Cute, heartwarming and absolutely nostalgic, "The Muppets" only downside is that it feels like two different shows pasted together; on one hand you have the plot thread about the Muppets getting back together for a final show, and on the other you have this Disney styled buddy romance triangle between Greg, his girlfriend and his brother Walter. The tone between those two plot threads varies quite a bit, with the trio being like something out of "Mary Poppins". All saccharine and happy song and dance.On the flipside, the tale of former muppet leader Kermit the Frog getting the gang back together is played more tragically and, believe it or not, more realistically. Yes he is a cloth puppet and so are the other Muppets, but this movie never panders to the kids. What we have is a story that adults can enjoy as well. The years have not been kind to the Muppets and Kermit is a performer past his prime, divorced from his former love Miss Piggy, with only memories and mementos of his glory days. As he tours the world looking for his friends, he sees the sorry state some of them have landed in. This story thread is both emotionally moving and ultimately satisfying. What's more, it would surprise you how vividly cloth and stick puppets emote. There is a certain warmth and realism present that even the best computer graphics animation cannot replicate. Despite having new voice actors, these are the same lovable characters from the original show, quirky personalities and all.Throughout the movie, the ongoing tension between Walter and Gary references the real life balance between childlike passion and adult responsibilities. With its self referencing narrative, the movie works as a parable about growing up and taking on new priorities in life; something many fans of the original muppets show would have personally experienced.But perhaps the main attraction is the movie's witty humor. Not even the fourth wall is safe as the characters lampoon everything from High school Musical style dance numbers to a time saving montage sequence. It is clever, well written comedy that pokes fun at itself and other shows. So hilarious that it has to be seen to be believed.The Muppets covers all grounds for a good movie experience. The most human of characters portrayed by inhuman looking cloth puppets, cast chemistry that tugs on the heart strings and a simple story that anyone can relate to. Throw in some catchy songs and celebrity cameos with a healthy dose of nostalgia for those who loved the original Muppets Show and you have a sure winner that appeals to fans new and old alike. And once the curtain comes down, you would be clamoring for an encore. Here is a true tribute to a timeless classic that brings a childhood icon to a whole new generation of viewers. Let us give a standing ovation to "The Muppets", definitely one of the must watch movies of the year.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Muppet Magic Returns</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really, really liked the newest Muppet film: The Muppets?in fact it's the best one since the first one. But, that said, I need to get three things out of the way first: Shame on them for using my favorite Muppet of all time, Pepe: The King Prawn, for all-but 30 seconds, the newest center-stage Muppet, Walter, is rather lame and how many Muppet story lines involve them trying to save the theatre? 40?Whew, just had to get those out of the way?This movie was hilarious and brought back all the memories of people who grew up on the Muppets. And it was so incredibly clean and family-friendly, I'm shocked it didn't earn a G-Rating. (Of course, not everyone felt it was family-friendly, thanks Fox News ? http://mediamatters.org/mmtv/201112020036.)I digress, once again, the Muppets have dismantled and forgotten until an obvious Muppet by the name of Walter convinces them to save their theatre once again. But, the adventure, heart, songs and traveling to get there is a great ride. And the obligatory cameos were absolutely hilarious ? especially Jack Black.I'm a huge Muppet fan, and even then, I was disappointed in a few of their outings. This one is clearly the best since the first one and I sincerely hope to see more.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>WEEKLY MOVIE REVIEW : THE MUPPETSONE-LINE REVIEW : If you liked the Muppet Movies, you'll love "The Muppets"RATING: "Wait for the instant download" (Rating System: "Watch it in theaters", "Wait for the instant download", "Don't waste your time")Gary (Jason Segel, "How I Met Your Mother") and Walter (a new Muppet voiced by Peter Linz) are brothers growing up in a small town. Gary grows but Walter stays the same size. Walter falls in love with the old "Muppet Show" and idolizes them. While Gary falls in love with Mary (Amy Adams, "Julie &amp; Julia"). The three go on a trip to Hollywood to see the Muppet Theater where they learn that Tex Richman (Chris Cooper, "The Tempest") wants to tear down the Muppet Theater to get at oil beneath the building. Walter, Gary, and Mary have just 48 hours to round up the old Muppets and put on marathon show to raise the 10 million dollars to save the theater. And we're off. . .If you're a fan of the original "Muppet Show" or the Muppet movies, then you're going to enjoy "The Muppets." The story is a cross between an old Mickey Rooney and Julie Garland film ("Hey kids, let's put on a show") and "The Blues Brothers" ("Hey, we're getting the band back together"). The plot is thin and is mainly a vehicle for all the characters from the original show to come back to the stage and put on a show as we remember it.There are a number of cameos (including Alan Arkin, Mickey Rooney, Jack Black, Sarah Silverberg, and more). There are tons of puns. And lots of inside jokes. One nice thing about the plot is that there are opportunities for growth for just about every major character. Everyone learns something about themselves.The movie is rated PG for reasons I don't understand. It is as clean cut as it gets. There may be some concern over explosions. But there is no swearing and nobody really gets hurt. Well, except the bad guy. I also noticed a complete absence of the Henson name in the movie (except a couple images of Jim Henson in pictures on the wall). Since Disney owns the Muppets I can see why this may be, however costumes were supplied by Jim Henson's Creature shop.This is a very good movie for older fans of the Muppets and a very nice introduction to the Muppets for a younger generation. But there is no reason to rush out and see it on the big screen. So, for a simple story told with love and affection for classic characters I recommend you "wait for the instant download."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Yep, they're baccckkkkk!!!!!! Surprisingly good!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When the film was announced, I was worried that it would flop, since Disney would try to "modernize" it. Turns out I worried needlessly! SPOILER ALERT! The plot was announced as someone trying to reunite the Muppets after a long absence. OK, typical enough - but how they did it surprised me. Basically, the person trying to bring the Muppets together is the brother of Segal's character, who is a Muppet himself, although he doesn't realize it. They inhabit a place called Small Town - which has every movie stereotype from the Fifties that you can imagine, including a nice little song and dance routine.Segal and Adams travel with Segal's Muppet brother to LA to see the ocean, and visit the Muppet theater. They find the theater is in the process of being bought by an oil man who wants to drill on the property. To stop him, the Muppets have to raise 10 million dollars within a week. The rest of the story revolves around getting the Muppets back together to put on a Muppet Show telethon to raise the money.The film continues to poke fun at old movie conventions. For instance, when they are traveling, one of the Muppets says that they are running out of time, so to speed things up, they say - "Oh, let's do a Montage".One example, that I think most people would miss, is when Amy Adams is is singing in Mel's Drive in. She takes a piece of bread, breaks it in half, puts forks in th pieces and does a dance routine with them on the table. This is straight of the classic Chaplin film "The Gold Rush".The resolution of the situation at the end of the film, while happy, arrives at that point through a somewhat convoluted means. It adds to the fun really! My only complaint is that the Muppets are voiced by new actors. They don't sound exactly like the old crew (Frank Oz, who did Fonzie bear and Yoda, was replaced for example) - but time does have to move forward.So, all in all, a fresh film for the Muppets. I am glad to see them back. To be honest with you, when they start the telethon, they open with a rendition of the old Muppets show opening number. A tear came to my eye as I remembered the joy that show would bring me.Kermit at one point muses "I guess we have been forgotten." No, Kermit, you were never forgotten. I am glad to see you back. And, judging from the from the popularity of the film, so are a whole bunch of others.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gave it 7 out of 10 because I'm a tough critic...but I really enjoyed this movie! Of course, I was a super-fan of the original series (anyone else remember Rudolph Nureyev and Miss Piggy dancing Swine Lake?)so, like many, I was somewhat dreading this new film. Yes, it is very, very corny, but it is also delightful. The jokes are spot on, the cameos are priceless, and even the songs were pretty good. The "Am I a Man or a Muppet" song was hilarious. My family and I went the day after Thanksgiving...ages ranging from 16 to 72. We all enjoyed it. The audience was diverse as well...all ages, genders and races. Everyone laughed. The little kids behind me knew the words to "Rainbow Connection." The 30-ish man sitting in front of my Aunt Mary laughed himself silly. If the movie has a few slow moments, just go with them. They don't last long and the highs are more than high enough to compensate. Thanks, "How I Met Your Mother" dude whose name I don't know because I don't watch that show. Thanks for bringing back the Muppets.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Muppets got me back in a nostalgic mood for those characters I loved watching so much as a kid</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just watched this movie with my movie theatre-working friend and, having just also seen the first two Muppet movies again, I felt like laughing and was feeling nostalgic throughout the whole experience to the point I almost was in tears when moments like when Kermit was singing about missing his old friends and then again when the whole gang was once again on stage reprising "The Rainbow Connection" near the end were happening. Kudos to Jason Segel in both co-writing and starring in what I'm sure was a labor of love to him. And his leading lady Amy Adams also was pretty charming enough. And then there's Walter, a new Muppet with voice by Peter Linz, that is partly the heart of this movie. The other part is of course that of Kermit in once again getting reacquainted with the likes of Fozzie, Gonzo, among others all the way down to perhaps the most endearing charms of the one and only Miss Piggy. There's also a nice campy villainous turn by Chris Cooper especially when he says "maniacal laugh" to his Muppet minions. There's also some entertaining original songs by Bret McKenzie and others that should get one either humming or tapping their toes like the show stopping "Life's a Happy Song" that could possibly get another Oscar nomination for a Muppet movie. The only songs I didn't like, to tell the truth, were the ones where Ms. Adams sings about being alone at a diner or that rap by Cooper but they don't ruin the film too much. In summary, I found myself grinning from ear to ear during most of the picture especially with all the usual, or unusual, celebrity cameos. So on that note, The Muppets gets a high recommendation from me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Rainbow Connection</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's been quite a while since the Muppets have been in a movie. The last was 1999's Muppets from Space which, for some inexplicable reason all the critics hated. That movie was just as good as any Muppet film, but perhaps the world had grown too cynical for the felt characters.In this new installment, cynicism is a strong theme running throughout. Can a group of Muppets who have never made a joke at the expense of another make a come back in a world that spends so much time scoffing at idealism and good-heartedness? The answer, of course, is yes. In the hands of star and co-writer Jason Segal, The Muppets is everything that made the characters so beloved in the first place. Frank Oz may have said that the film doesn't stay true to the characters, but he's dead wrong. The Muppet gang is as good natured as ever, and is always optimistic in the face of despair.The story follows Gary (Segal) and his girlfriend going to Los Angeles to celebrate their 10th anniversary. Gary brings along his brother, Walter, who is not only a Muppet creature, but a huge fan of the Muppets. When they arrive in LA, Walter discovers that an evil oil tycoon is planning to tear down the Muppet Theater. The only way to save it is for the gang to get back together and put on a show to raise 10 million dollars.Everyone is wonderful in the film. Jason Segal is funny and sweet as the main character, and Amy Adams does a superb job at playing the often out-of-the-loop girlfriend. But the real stars are the Muppets, who are all wonderfully handled and, as always, have remarkable depth. Kermit is always a leader, yet we see he has trouble showing his emotions, which results in him and Miss Piggy having relationship problems throughout the film. Piggy's "I am woman" persona is a front for her many insecurities.The "lets do one last show" plot allows for a lot of nostalgia to come into the film. But not for one moment does it seem unwanted or overly cheesy. The film is really about the Muppets finding themselves again. In the uber-commercialism of the 21st century, the seemed to have lost their place (Scooter has been working for Google). With the help of long time fan Jason Segal, the Muppets have re-established themselves as characters unmoved by modern bleakness.If there is anything to complain about in The Muppets, it's that it takes a little too long for Walter and co. to finally meet the Muppets, and there is not nearly enough Gonzo. But hey, that's what Muppets from Space is for.This new installment in the Muppets series is as good, funny, and heartwarming as anyone could have hoped. For older audience members it will also be a wonderful nostalgia trip, filled with references to classic Muppet moments. And this film adds plenty of brand new moments that are sweet, delightful, and very funny.http://thatguythatlikesmovies.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"The Muppets" is a family film in the purest sense of the word</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like many people, the Muppets were a big part of my childhood. I watched Sesame Street in the morning, Muppet Babies in the afternoon, and Muppet Show reruns in the evening. The Muppets are a national institution in the United States and beloved the world over. As most know, they came from the mind of Jim Henson. Henson's sense of humor was that perfect balance of the crass and the innocent, the surreal and real, the sly and the whimsical. He knew how to entertain kids and adults simultaneously, an uneasy feat most in the film and television industry can't master. In short, Henson knew how to make family entertainment. That's why the vast majority of products worked and remain staples in American culture two decades after his death.After Henson died, the Muppet name didn't hold the same weight. Henson's presence was missing in the Muppets' last full length feature "Muppets in Space" and it showed. For a decade, the Muppets were virtually out of sight and, barring die hard fans, out of mind. Then in 2009, the Muppets went viral with their rendition of Bohemian Rhapsody and re-entered the consciousness of the general public. With 20 million hits plus, the video was an obvious smash but it was only a lead up to a new full-length feature, released two year to the day of the Muppets Bohemian Rhapsody video.By the time I put my money down and got my ticket, I knew the film was in good hands. I've seen many of the aforenamed videos on YouTube and that wry, yet goofy, Muppet-esque humor was there. I knew if the same people involved with the video made the film, it was going to be a treat.The film's main protagonist is Walter, a puppet living in a human world. His brother, Gary (played by co-writer Jason Segal) has always been there for him. The two are close to the point of borderline codependency and even well into their thirties, they've lived under the same roof. Walter is a full blown fan of the Muppets, and has been since his adolescence.At the same time, Gary is in a very, very long term relationship with school teacher Mary (played by Amy Adams) who longs for the day when Gary finally proposes and cuts the emotional, inch-long chord binding Gary and his brother. Their relationship is further strained when Gary brings Walter along with him and Mary on a trip to Los Angeles, a trip that was supposed to be a romantic getaway for Gary and Mary. Gary and Mary take Walter on a trip to, what Gary considers, hallowed ground: the Muppet Studios. What was once a small, though busy, film studio has since become a dump since the Muppets went their separate ways. While sneaking into Kermit's old office, Gary learns that an oil baron plans on tearing down the lot and digging for that sweet, sweet black gold. The three vacationers find the residence of a certain Kermit the Frog. After Walter, Gary and Mary explain the situation to Kermit (and a lovely musical number) the plucky little frog sets out to find his friends and save a place they once called home.The film is filled with so many celebrity cameos, sight-gags, sneaky jokes, and solid musical numbers that ranged from hilarious to touching, it would take more than the allotted 1000 word limit to explain it all. Then again, isn't that was a Muppet movie is all about? The pacing is quick and the run time is short, and yet the characters were able to develop beautifully. The movie routinely broke the fourth wall and made numerous references to pop culture, but didn't force jokes as other family films are wont to do. The Muppets even had a few good laughs at themselves through the film and yet they reminded the audience of what made them such a beloved entity. It was obvious Jim Henson's hand was over "The Muppets" (and if one looks carefully, they will see Henson's face in the movie twice). This film is a gem of this autumn/winter season and is a must see for Muppet fanatics and newbies alike.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beyond words - Jim Henson would be proud</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1990, the world lost one of its greatest creators of perfect childhood memories. In his short time on this earth, Jim Henson shared his great craft with so many people through so many mediums. Among his first creations an easy going dog, Rowlf, a witty frog that became his trademark amphibian, Kermit, and a frackle that would later become Gonzo the Great. These creations mixed with many others became the cast of the great comedy variety show The Muppet Show known to many who grew up in that era as one of the most iconic shows of its time.Then after three successful movies, an animated spin-off from the third film, and Jim Henson's tragic demise, the Muppets fell into disrepair. Jim Henson Productions was passed around from owner to owner while it limped along and a few less than stellar films were released along with a failed revisit to the variety show routine (the absence of many of the original characters may have had something to do with that). The future appeared bleak.Until now.This movie is near perfect. It brings back the old crew with similar antics as seen in the original Muppet Movie. It develops new muppets well. It utilizes cameos for quick gags as the original films did. It pays homage to the original Muppet Movie without trying to reinvent what the muppets were. It even utilizes great comedic actors like Jack Black, who plays an unwilling guest star to the new Muppet Show. the music numbers are brilliant. If you had a childhood that was invested in Jim Henson and you did not cry during the Rainbow Connection bit, you have no soul.About the only downside was all the extreme close-up shots of muppets attempting to interact with people and dancers in the background. The director should have taken a better look at how muppets interacted with people in The Muppets Take Manhattan. This will definitely have to be addressed in future films. I hope this film brings back a solid franchise.9.5/10</fullReview>

However, it's currently in possession of the greedy Tex Richman (Played by Chris Cooper), and unless the Muppets can raise ten million dollars to buy back the theater, Richman will tear it down to claim the oil underneath it. Walter, Gary and Mary find Kermit the Frog and share this information, and so they rally together to get the whole Muppet gang back together, and put on a show to raise the money.The Muppets is that gem of a movie that doesn't come along very often, one that had me smiling the entire time. I'll get my minor, brief issues with moments of rushed pacing and characterization out of the way pretty quickly. You might have thought that Jason Segel and Nicholas Stoller, of 2008's Forgetting Sarah Marshall, would be the LAST candidates to write a Muppet movie, but what they construct is not only the funniest movie I've seen all year, and one of the absolute most entertaining, it's also a project with the utmost passion and heart behind it.There are a lot of laughs in this movie (including some really clever fourth wall gags), and never does it feel mean spirited for the sake of being mean spirited. Hilarity without vulgarity. And even at its utmost random (Such as a rap by Chris Cooper that seems to come out of nowhere), the humor never feels unwelcome. But it's not just humor mind you, there's a heartfelt attention to character, a keen sense of emotion, and a nostalgic style that perfectly nails that of the old TV show and movies. But on top of that, they also take time to explore some interesting ideas in regards to today's ideas of stardom and popularity.But of course, it wouldn't be a proper Muppet movie without some great original songs, and Bret McKenzie of Flight of the Conchords fully meets that task, and then some. He contributes five (counting that aforementioned rap by Chris Cooper) original songs to the film, including "Man or Muppet", a duet with Walter and Gary that plays at a pivotal scene, and "Life a Happy Song", the beautiful opening and closing number that is seriously deserving of recognition by the Academy Awards.I'll encourage anyone to see this movie over the Thanksgiving weekend, and even see it again myself. It's just a shame that it had to open so close to movies like Breaking Dawn Part 1, which will take box office business that The Muppets so richly deserves.***1/2 out of ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Old Gang's Still Got It!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After 12 years since their last theatrical appearance, Jim Henson's felt creations are back and they still have what it takes to greatly entertain.The movie concerns the groups' biggest fan, a puppet named Walter, who finds kindred spirits in them when he feels alone among the humans of his home town in Smalltown USA. Taking a trip with his brother Gary (Jason Segal) and Gary's girlfriend Mary (Amy Adams, who fits right in), he finds Muppet Studios abandoned and about to be destroyed by oil baron Tex Richman (Chris Cooper). Thus the trio set out to reunite the disbanded Muppets and save the theater.It brings back memories of the Muppet Show and 80s movies, complete with allusions &amp; references to the gang's early works and appearances by obscure &amp; forgotten Muppet characters of old. There are musical numbers varying size, gratuitous celebrity cameos, showbiz jokes, and some good old fashioned fourth wall breaking ("Wow, that was an expensive looking explosion! I can't believe we had that in the budget.")There's slapstick, silliness, and some stirring moments (which I won't spoil here). I also appreciated the commentary about the Muppets'unfortunate standing in the world, which might be a little annoying to Muppet fans, but is sadly true and needed to be addressed (I can imagine a show like "Punch Teacher" being very popular if it was real). Hopefully this movie can change that, if just to a certain extent.I'll admit that some the jokes fall flat, a couple of the numbers are fairly unnecessary, and some the cameos are just pointless. But after the dull, near lifeless "Muppets From Space" that almost killed the franchise and several uneven (at best) TV movies, it's good to see the gang back on the big screen again. Especially when they're in such great form after so long.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow, what a comeback for the muppets! A great story about Kermit the Frog and company wanting to reunite and save their old Hollywood studio from becoming an oilfield. An 80's robot helps locate Miss Piggy, Animal, Fozzy Bear, Rolf and everyone else to do a telethon and raise 10 million dollars to save the Muppet studio from destruction by an oil tycoon.Lots of songs sung and of course that beautiful Rainbow song sung by Kermit on the log in the woods (opening of the 1979 Muppet Movie).A very enjoyable film that brought a tear or two to my eyes (and I'm over 40), especially at the end, when a mass of muppet fans embrace the return of the muppets! Wanna go back to your childhood?? THIS IS THE FILM! Enjoy! 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pure Joy!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Henson's Muppets have been around forever, and part of their appeal is their ability to let us have fun with nothing to worry about. They're innocent, with definite personalities, and I wish I could say true mirrors of ourselves. We could only wish we could solve problems like they do, in 90 minutes. Maybe that's why this movie is a joy to watch. It gives us plenty to be cheerful about, and it is a way to escape reality.In the film, the Muppets themselves are somewhat pass, according to the latest survey by the media authorities. In fact, they are about to lose their beloved theater, and much like most of America, they have managed to isolate themselves from each other. However, there is now an opportunity to work together, to rekindle the flame, to bring everything back to normal, and that will require some work and plenty of fun along the way.Soon, Kermit, Ms. Piggy, and their new friends, including an adorable new Muppet, Walter, are on a quest around the world to reunite the old gang, put on a show, and reach their goal. There is nothing complicated or too fancy along the way, just simple, funny dialog, much of it with a touch of innocence, and a hint of subversion. Characters turn around and let us in the joke, and modern audiences get their winks.In the end, the film is sweet, looks amazing, and fresh, and for a moment we forget our worries, how we have forgotten to connect to the children in us, and we regain our sense of wonder, singing happy tunes, laughing and clapping at simple, funny jokes. In the end this is pure joy!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Great Movie for Muppet Lovers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am 35 and vividly remember watching The Muppet Show growing up. I have watched all the previous Muppet Movies (some better than others) and have to say that this installment did the Muppet Franchise proud! The movie stays very true to the original format. No 2011 whistles and bells here, just the tried and true Muppets! Get the gang back together, put on a show, Kermit and Miss Piggie at odds, musical numbers, a few of the great songs (Manamana, Rainbow Connection), a few great Muppet punches, and Fozzie's old jokes...it's all there! My kids (almost 8 and 9 years old) enjoyed it and wanted to pull out my old DVD's to watch more as soon as we got home.It was a little odd watching Amy Adams (who has been in some raunchy comedies) and Jason Segel (who has ALSO been in some raunchy comedies) in these roles, but after about 15 minutes I got used to it and started to enjoy their innocent characters. They are definitely not the stars of the show (Jack Black even upstages them and he's only in the movie for like 10 minutes total), but they aren't intended to be. If you grew up with the Muppets, this is a MUST SEE. Expect to be transported to your youth.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Looks like the Muppets are indeed back</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was afraid for the new movie The Muppets. I feared that it wouldn't live up to my anticipation which has been building up since the first teaser parody. And it mostly certainly did.In the new movie, Walter is a huge Muppet fan, and he lives with his brother Gary (Jason Segel). The two and Gary's girlfriend (Amy Adams) visit Los Angeles for the couple's tenth anniversary. Walter makes them all visit the Muppet Studios. It heartbreakingly is all deteriorated and gross.But Tex Richman (Chris Cooper), and his band of "evil" Muppets have different plans. They want to take the old theatre/studios and drill for the oil underneath it. Walter overhears and the trio begin a journey to get the old gang back together again.The gang has to put on a show, similar to when they were on the Muppet Show all those years ago. They have to raise $10 million and get a celebrity host as well. The end result of the show will make you teary-eyed and nostalgic.The movie is almost near-perfect, with a sweet beginning, fastly-paced middle, and as Uncle Deadly puts it, a "charming finale". The Muppets are at home, with their manic, zany humor, and their deadpan breaking of the fourth wall.However, it has some faults. The first one is that it was too short. At roughly 90-92 minutes of screen time, I felt it could have been another 10-15 minutes longer. This would have given more Muppet screen time for people such as Gonzo as well as Statler and Waldorf. The other one is the lack of memorable celebrity cameos. After hearing the following; George Clooney, Sean Penn, Christian Bale, Lady Gaga, Ed Helms, Ben Stiller, Billy Crystal, Jane Lynch, Anne Hathaway, Ricky Gervais, Charles Grodin, and even Elmo; were supposed to be in this, I felt disappointed. They could have helped the movie feel even more special.Overall, I say that you should see it twice. Bring your friends and family with you. It's the film that let me know that the Muppets can co-exist with the raunchiness and flashiness of modern American culture. And as I saw when I left the movie, you'll be like a toddler, saying goodbye to the Muppets but most importantly, Animal!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's disheartening to read poor reviews of this film. I went to see it last night with my family, and we all loved it. Everyone else I've spoken to has loved it as well, regardless of their previous exposure to the Muppets.From the start, they do away with the 4th wall, invoke celebrity cameos, poke fun at Hollywood plot impossibilities, drop tongue-in-cheek references to days of Muppet yore, and acknowledge that media aimed at children has lost its "goodie goodie" nature. I agree with them-- after spending 10 years trying to keep my child away from garbage TV, it's wonderful and refreshing to see humor done with class again. I sincerely hope that this acts as a launching pad for Muppet Studios to begin producing regular media for our kids.Bravo, Muppets. Keep it up.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Return For The Muppets</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie opens focusing on the relationship between Gary and Walter who are "twin" brothers, and how their relationship effects Gary's high school sweetheart, Mary. The storyline of Gary and Walter is pretty much present through out, but Mary seems to fall flat and 2 dimensional. As the story grows the Moopets also don't seem as menacing and seem only around for a few jokes, as with Richman who only impaired the Muppets during the Telethon. But through out it was enjoyable, a little disappointed with the lack of original songs in the middle of the film. While I know that writing original music is hard, that was the charm that the original The Muppet Movie (1979) had. While maybe the use of unoriginal songs was used during the Telethon, that was present during the show so I had no problem with it. Even if the music used was obscure old tunes from the 60s or 70s, but seemed more of the choices from a thirteen year old's ipod's greatest hits.While the movie was enjoyable, Jason Segal's performance superb, and the emotion and complexity of the Muppets and the dynamic back story told of their separation. The lack of original music, and lack of a need for Mary in the story keeps me from rating this film a 10/10.</fullReview>

It has this timeless quality to it in that many of the things the Muppets do for entertainment never seem wear and tear at the felt seams over time, It's one of the advantages of being Hand-made and not hand-drawn.It's Hard for any one to hate the antics of Kermit and pals, even the most cynical and fun-hating of people pone to getting annoyed will find themselves succumbing to awesome power of an Aforementioned frog's banjo and a bear's bad jokes that are constant targets for heckling. Even the sunny and colourful songs avoid entering sickly-sweet Saccherine town because in the Muppet franchise no age or demographic gets left behind.The Muppets did what J.J Abrams did for Star Trek in that it took an age old franchise and pumped wholley good energy back into it ready in time for it to delight a new generation of HensonWorshipers with Gags, Clebraties and laughter galore!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Mupps Still Have It, But Amy Adams Has Gained About A 130 Pounds</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>whoa. that fat thing was Amy Adams? no kidding. she used to be so petite. big as a house! the only guess i have is that she must have been in early pregnancy. i don't read celebrity gossip so i haven't heard anything. oh well. she is still really cute though. and she is still a very engaging talent despite the MASSIVE weight gain. maybe they wanted her to be a chubbo because her love interest Jason Segel is a chubby pappy.the Muppet Puppets are still predictably tried and true and still as funny as ever. the Muppet Puppet performers have always played a full hand. good production design and polished filmmaking, well staged musical numbers, impressive puppetry from the Henson workshop, good solid performances by the human actors, and most of all, good, funny comedy routines. i've always felt that next to the puppets themselves, the humour was the best thing about them, it's as good as anything offered in comedy.i heard Segel was a Mupp fan from childhood. well it definitely shows because he wrote the screenplay here with a lot of loving understanding of what makes the Muppets work.there were some really funny musical moments here for those that love the Muppets sense of musical comedy. the rap song sung by Tex Richman was hilarious and weirdly reminiscent of that awful musical number from 'Attack of the Killer Tomatoes'. the song "Am I A Muppet or A Man" sung by Segel himself was a tongue in cheek riot and one of the best moments in the film. Amy Adams has a real funny moment too where she feels rejected and is having lunch alone while pathetically in denial warbling "I'm Having A Party of Me! Whee!" it's a hilarious example of helplessness and self pity perceived in a strangely cynical and unsympathetic perspective. i never laughed as hard as i did during these over the top musical flirts.Jack Black was here as his usual funny, average schmo persona, and Selena Gomez was amusingly befuddled about who and what the Muppet's celebrity status is. cameos have always been a Mupp trademark and this film has them without being overbearingly pushy or promoting.the only sour note i can think of here is the end credits where the Muppets are attributed to "the sole property of Disney". crime and a shame. i hope future generations come to understand that Disney had nothing to do with the development of the Muppets. they were the dream child of the incredible Jim Henson. Disney only purchased the Muppet franchise after Henson passed away unexpectedly. if there is any good in this it is that the Muppets still remain true to the spirit and imagination of Jim Henson and don't seem too "Disneyfied".this is a great family film and a funny quasi-musical. there are plenty of Muppet monkey shenanigans that keep the film moving briskly and on time. it hardly feels the 103 minutes that is possibly too long for something as lightweight as this. the Muppets are one of the movie industries bright spots and more palatable than a lot of over promoted Hollywood products. they certainly deserve the love and amused affection that their many fans have for them.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If the goal of making "The Muppets" was to make a very fun, enjoyable movie, then they succeeded in every way. Of course, the movie also brings up the issue of nostalgia, but it's mostly an hour and a half of fun. Even the musical numbers were kind of neat, and I'm not someone who usually goes for musicals. As with the previous movies, they sprinkle the movie with cameos and bit parts by famous people in addition to Kermit, Piggy, Fozzie, Gonzo, etc, and the main stars. Seriously, it's just a movie that you gotta love. Does the movie have any downside? Maybe the occasional low humor, but everything else more than makes up for that.

		<shortDescription>Funny and sweet - I think Jim Henson would approve</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have been a fan of the Muppets since I started watching "The Muppet Show" as a child during the 70s. Though after "Muppets From Space", I was starting to wonder if the magic had gone. Thankfully, this movie shows there is still life in this franchise. Although it will help if you're familiar with the Muppets, there's still enough in this movie to tickle and warm the heart of those unfamiliar with the characters. Personally, I was extra thrilled by the fact that they brought back Rowlf - my favorite Muppet - and gave him some lines of dialogue. In fact, many of the classic characters are resurrected and play a part in the movie.As much as I enjoyed the movie, I did have two minor quibbles:(1) The movie never really examines the issue of why the Muppets had disbanded. They split up years ago... but why? It's a noticeable gap in the narrative.(2) Some of the Muppets don't sound quite like they did years ago. Now, I realize some of the classic Muppet performers have died, and that Frank Oz couldn't be coaxed out of retirement, but I think they could have searched harder for voice actors who sounded more like the original performers.But apart from those minor flaws, the movie is definitely worth seeing, whether you are 8 or 80.</fullReview>

I have watched every movie and every episode of the TV show, and I've just been introduced to the Muppets about 3 or 4 years ago. I was a bit nervous about going into this movie, as the non-parody trailers were not a very big turn on to the movie. Boy was I wrong. What we have here is a movie that not only breathes life into a dormant franchise for all of the old fans, but also to a whole new generation of new fans. This is a near perfect film. The storyline is great, the acting is terrific, the jokes are hilarious, the songs are amazing (Man or Muppet needs to win an Oscar) and each and every Muppet gets their well deserved screen time.I recommend this movie to everyone out there. My one complaint is that during the long-awaited "Muppet Telethon" sequence, there was no Swedish Chef scene. Oh well, I still loved it. GO SEE IT!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Waldorf: "Nope! The Muppets are as one-dimensional as they've always been!"You can go home again, at least if you're the Muppets, those genius Jim Henson creations that for over 40 years have inspired Sesame Street and Muppet movie mania not in 3-D. The most recent of the canon, The Muppets, chronicles the gang getting together to help save the old studio from a mean old oilman. They must do a telethon to raise the $10 million to save the place or it goes to Tex Richman (Chris Cooper). Writer/actor Jason Segel as Gary and wholesome Amy Adams as Mary are the adult real people who help the Muppets put together the fund raiser, with the cameo help of several stars including the indomitable Mickey Rooney, who did a fund raising show or two in his cinematic prime. The film shares Rooney's love of performance as if their lives depended on it, and their survival does. But nothing to fear, for they are as melodic and eccentric as ever. Spirits are high as Miss Piggy and Kermit try to overcome their tempestuous tendencies for the good of the group. Newcomer Muppet Walter may not be as talented as the famous puppets, but his character allows us to be awed with him by the star power of the original cast, showing us all how we can become a part of the family with a little imagination. Although I love words, I would have liked fewer of those and more songs, which have been Muppet strength since the beginning. Songwriter Bret McKenzie's Life's a Happy Song and Man or Muppet are toe-tapping memorable and worthy to stand beside the chestnut of them all, Rainbow Connection, which features Miss Piggy and Kermit and the crew at their most romantic and familial. Yes, family is the real connection in this and all Muppet productions. But that they are puppets not computer images beats even Pixar to the tears. Fozzie Bear: "Wow, that was such an expensive looking explosion! I can't believe we had that in the budget."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Muppets a winner</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You're gonna laugh a lot, and you're gonna cry a little. That's the Muppet formula and has been for four decades. Whether it's Fozzie's goshawful jokes or Kermit and Miss Piggy singing "Rainbow Connection," The Muppets have always known just which heartstrings to pull. This version - reboot? - manages to combine the sweetness of the original movie with the chaos and unfettered hilarity of the TV series. It's well cast, and when it's all over your cheeks will hurt from laughing and your eyes will be damp. Yep, it's one of those.Are you over 12? Doesn't matter. Those of us who grew up on Sesame Street know all about Muppets, and they're as beloved by us now as they were in the 1970s. Each character a contrasting individual with eccentricities in full bloom. And all under the control of only a select few operators!The Muppets follows a fairly common theme in movies - something is about to be lost (in this case, the old Muppet Theater in which the original series was filmed), so Something Must Be Done before an evil someone takes over and does bad things. It's not a complex formula, something like A + B + C. Here, the old "let's put on a show" trope gets a genuinely funny - and sincere - workout.To begin with, there's a new Muppet, named Walter. In what's one of the funniest unspoken jokes, Walter seemingly has no idea he is a puppet. After all, he has a human brother named Gary (Jason Segal) and seems only mildly perturbed when he himself never grows any taller during the "early life" montage. Walter is a huge Muppets fan, and it's not tough to see that one reason this is so is that he sees something of himself in them, even if he has no idea what that is.Gary, now in his twenties - as is Walter, believe it or not - has a longtime girlfriend named Mary. Gary plans to take Mary to Los Angeles (they live in Smalltown, USA) to celebrate ten years together, and as fate would have it, Walter comes along as well. That's when they discover that the famed Muppet Studios is now a crappy fifty-cent tour full of dust and decaying memories; Walter surreptitiously learns that the land is about to become property of one Tex Richman (Chris Cooper) who tells everyone he plans to build a Muppet museum but who secretly wishes to destroy all of the property so that he can drill for oil. This leads Walter, Gary, and Mary to visit Kermit the Frog and convince him to get the old gang back together so that they can raise enough money to keep the studio.It's a very simple plot, and of course kids aren't going to care about a lack of nuance. In fact, this movie revels in it, mocking such standards as musical and travel montages (in a couple scenes, characters travels by map, a la Indiana Jones). There's no need for a complicated plot. All you need is Muppets and a reason for them to be there.The ingenuity of the very first Muppet movie was in how sweetly it introduced us to characters we already knew. Kermit's travels, picking up Fozzie, Gonzo, Rowlf, Electric Mayhem, and Miss Piggy, were a wonderful road movie full of puns, laughter, and sincerity. This movie manages to capture quite a bit of that same sentiment. You see, the movie is set in the real world, and the Muppets have been forgotten - in real life, they haven't made a movie since 1999. So the various Muppets have scattered. Fozzie, for example, fronts a faux Muppets act in Reno, Nevada. I am not making that up. Piggy works for Vogue magazine. Gonzo is a plumbing magnate. True story.The movie nails the sentiment, then. It's about many things, and kids will take many lessons from it (subconsciously, of course). One should never give up hope on one's dreams. One should always look for one's own special talent. One should love one's friends and family, overlooking their weaknesses and giving them strength. One should work well with others. In essence, that's what all the Muppet shows and series have been about - working together as a team to accomplish something genuine and beautiful, and this movie really does a terrific job of making every single character's effort seem worthwhile and necessary. This isn't a sappy movie, either. There was actual applause - from kids as well as adults - in the theater in which I saw this film. It never drags, even with musical numbers - and even those music numbers are mocked by the characters themselves ("didn't we just sing this song?"). The tone is artfully woven; we laugh, we cry, and we beam because that is how infused with meaning and sincerity these characters truly are. And oh yes, there are some celebrity cameos, though not really very many. Only one of them, Alan Arkin, actually appeared on the original Muppet Show series, interestingly enough; I kept waiting for Steve Martin or Mel Brooks to show up, but no.And I'm betting there weren't many dry eyes in the audience when, during the telethon to raise money, Kermit and Miss Piggy duet on "Rainbow Connection," banjo and all. Adults mouthing the words, kids in awe. A real treat.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Muppets (1:43, PG) ? other: talking animals, 3rd string, sequel, OSIT romanticsMy reviews are totally subjective. I say what *I* think, how *I* react, and so you may wish to take this one with a grain of salt.I unabashedly love the Muppets. Did going in. Did coming out.Apparently I'm not the only one. Here's a link to what I consider the best TV commercial of all time: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dX9GTUMh490 It features brief appearances by Thomas Edison, Bucky Fuller, Martha Graham, Pablo Picasso, and Albert Einstein, but notice whose picture shows up when they drop the word "genius".I'm guessing that Alan Arkin, Jack Black, Emily Blunt, James Carville, Zach Galifianakis, Whoopi Goldberg, Selena Gomez, Neil Patrick Harris, Jim Parsons, Mickey Rooney, Kristen Schaal, and Sarah Silverman all agree, because each of them signed on for a cameo appearance.The plot is paper-thin. The idea is to reunite the Muppets to save their old, cobwebby, dilapidated theater from being torn down by the subtly named Tex Richman (Chris Cooper), who wants the oil beneath it. It's basically "Let's put on a show." And so they do. They sing. They dance. They drum. They blow things up.The catalysts for the reunion are 2 brothers, Gary (Jason Segel) and Walter (a muppet voiced by Peter Linz), and Gary's long-time girlfriend Mary (adorable, endearing Amy Adams, a human muppet perfectly cast as literally a Smalltown sweetheart). I haven't been a fan of Segel as an actor, nor was I fond of his performance here, but he gets huge props as screenwriter (along with Nicholas Stoller) and executive producer; apparently it was a labor of love for him, too. Steve Whitmire voices Kermit the Frog plus 4 others; Eric Jacobson does Miss Piggy and Fozzie Bear + 3; and Dave Goelz does Gonzo + 5. They are all fine.The movie is corny, slapstick, juvenile, and unabashedly sentimental. Production design is basically plywood and terrycloth. There are lots of tunes, all effective in context, but the only truly memorable one is a reprise of "Rainbow Connection". There are sight gags, puns, onomatopoetic smilers, and a wealth of metahumor. There are many laff-out-loud moments and more than one where I found myself blubbering like a baby. For good, clean, wholesome fun, it can't be beat. I'm not sure where the "P" In front of "G" came from, maybe it means that parents shouldn't miss it.I love these guys.BONUS: The feature is preceded by a terrific cartoon in which one of the Toy Story characters gets misplaced on a trip to the fast-food Poultry Palace.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One-Time Watch!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'The Muppets' caught my attention right from the moment I saw it's first promo, the promos were looking fantastic. The soundtrack was ruling my Ipod, so watching 'The Muppets' was a must for me! James Bobin's 'The Muppets' is a film that works in bits and pieces. It has a terrific first hour, but the second hour struggles. However, It's amazing music, Camera-work, the art of puppetry and a superb performance by Steve Whitmire as Kermy makes this half-hearted fare a decent one-time watch.Here's something I want to say: Shiraz Ahmed's screenplay is watertight in the first hour. The suspense unfolds beautiful, it's keeps you at the Grip. But as soon the second hr beings, the screenplay becomes a mess. The climax, especially, is the weakest link. It leaves no impact whatsoever! A film that could've been a power-packed entertainer, sadly ends up becoming a strictly one-time watch, as mentioned from the beginning.Watch 'The Muppets' for the pluses it has. But be ready to come out half-hearted!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Godfather 3 meets the Muppets</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The new Muppet movie was not good. I expected more from the House of Muppet. I don't think Jim Henson would have approved of this movie at all. I came to see the Muppets and found a story about some dude trying to get with a chick. Honestly did u care to see anything involving the human cast? The Muppet's were truly reduced to background props. My kids were ready to go from the start, and i cant blame them. It was to many dry songs, and lame cameos. This Segel dude really got his shine on, might as well painted him green and called him Kermit. Since when did the Muppets need such much help from outsiders. This movie had the potential, but missed the mark by a mile. The Muppets movie got caught up in the hype, and didn't deliver the goods to old and new fans alike. I know you will see the movie because of the name but don't do it unless u like Godfather 3.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Muppets "comeback" movie is a triumph!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Over the past year, I had been following how production had been going on this movie ever since I got back into the Muppets. To tell the truth, as soon I saw the first teaser trailer (you should check them out; they're over-the-top hilarious!), I knew it was going to do well. My predictions were confirmed when I saw it just last week. Not only does it bring back the classic feel of the Muppets' humour, it has the power to melt your heart clean away!Walter is the most relatable character you could possibly imagine appearing in a Muppets movie. Walter is like any other Muppet, but he just needs to find himself, and he eventually learns that just because you haven't found your talent doesn't mean you don't have one. Gary is also one of the rare "generous brother" characters, and that's a good thing (and believe me, there should be more of those). But he also learns to make time for others as well.But, the songs will win you over the most (but, if they don't, there's something terribly wrong with your brain). Whether it be the cheerful and cleverly funny "Life's a Happy Song," the nostalgic tear-jerker "Pictures in My Head" (clearly my most personal favourite right now), the obviously carefully-written "Man or Muppet" (which was funny and enlightening at the same time), or another pick that didn't make it on the eligible Oscar nominee list, they'll have you tapping your foot through the whole picture.So, even if you aren't a Muppets fan, I suggest you give this flick a try. You will not regret it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Greetings again from the darkness. Since I recently selected an animated film as my favorite movie of the year (Toy Story 3), it is to be expected that I would find the first Muppets movie in 12 years to be quite enjoyable. Actually I went in with high expectations since the director is James Bobin, who was the creator of "Flight of the Conchords", one of my favorite cult TV shows. Although Bret and Jermaine don't make an appearance (though Bret McKenzie does write the songs), there is still loads of fun to be had.Jason Segel and Amy Adams star, along with Chris Cooper, Rashida Jones, Jack Black and a long list of celebs who I won't name here ... it's much more fun to spot them as they arrive on screen. The old gang is back, including Kermit, Miss Piggy, Gonzo (now owner of plumbing company Royal Flush), Fozzie Bear (in a casino act), Animal (straight out of Anger Management) and of course, my favorites, Statler and Waldorf.There are a couple of tributes to the genius that was Jim Henson, creator of the Muppets. You will notice a poster of him outside the studio and a photograph on the wall of Kermit's office. No real need to go into the story, but I think most will be impressed not just with the cameos and songs, but also the depth of the script. There is a reason for the Muppets revival, and I am very happy to see the band is back together!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>We needed this. (Mild Spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is a specific moment in "The Muppets" where the film manages to pull off that sadly infrequent feat of cinema: It takes that one extra step beyond it's already established level of excellence and into the pantheon of the classics. The moment is simple- some of the Muppets (led by a motivated Miss Piggy) have abducted someone (not saying who). They have arrived (as a group)- prisoner in tow- at Kermit the frog's door in the early evening to explain to him what they have done and to urge him to continue on with a planned telethon to save the Muppet Theater. One of the characters points out to Kermit "You see? You inspired us!" to which he replies, horrified, "To kidnap people!?"He may be green, he may never give up and he may be an eternal optimist- but the frog has been around the block a few times and he knows when things may have gone a step too far. The new film "The Muppets" understands that Kermit is wise enough in the ways of the world to temper his optimism with a sense of responsibility without losing it. It also understands that the values of friendship, loyalty, decency and honor are still worth prizing and that - in today's culture of celebrity scandals, obnoxious reality TV and downbeat news - we need an injection of the aggressive optimism Jim Henson introduced when he created Kermit and his cohorts all those years ago.As the story opens, Gary (Jason Segel) and his Muppet brother Walter are due to head to Hollywood with Gary's girlfriend Mary (Amy Adams). Once there, they stop by the defunct Muppet Theater and discover that a twisted oil baron (Chris Cooper)has plans to level it in an effort to drill for some crude located beneath the property. Walter (who adores the Muppets, a group who allowed him to vicariously fit in when his Muppetness placed distinct differences between himself and the human beings surrounding him every day of his life) and his human companions set about reuniting the long separated Muppet gang ,who then decide to put on a show to raise the necessary funds to save the theater..and perhaps the magic that once made them so beloved. I could describe more, but there's really no point. With it's catchy songs (some new, some classic and at least one guaranteed to make even the most jaded adult eyes misty with memories ), dead on satire of cinematic devices ( I will never again be able to see a montage unfold without smiling after this flick) and clever nods to the inherent absurdity of the staging of production numbers in musicals , merely reading about this movie could never conceivably do it justice. It's one of those films that needs to be experienced firsthand. "The Muppets" is a rare cinematic creature..a film that gets it absolutely right, understanding the founding principles which made the titular characters so enduring to begin with while simultaneously providing a fresh, quirky new narrative in which to reintroduce the beloved icons of the felt and fur set to another generation of audiences.At a time when a lot of miserable dreck occupies theaters, saturates television and fills Netflix cues far and wide, it's a breath fresh air to see a film that gleefully addresses life -with all of it's peaks and valleys -by delivering a sly wink,a knowing smile and exuding unabashed hopefulness. Whether we're four or forty, each of us has inside the desire to find the Rainbow Connection..and "The Muppets" - with it's rapid fire in- jokes, cheerful music and good natured sensibility - taps directly into that, reminding us of what we learned from Kermit, Piggy, Fozzie , Gonzo, Dr.Teeth and the Electric Mayhem, Rowf, Dr. Bunsen Honeydew and Beaker, the Swedish Chef and the rest to begin with : That joy,laughter, friendship and love are not only what make it all worthwhile, they may just be the ingredients necessary to make it work. I am rarely this entertained when I go to the movies. I was blindsided. Consequently, I rate The Muppets a much deserved ten out of ten.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Perfect Muppet Movie For Every New And Old Fan</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Muppets haven't really been in the spotlight for a few years. They've had some TV appearances but other then that The Muppets haven't had a big screen appearance for over a decade. So when I saw the trailer for this movie I was sold immediately. And let me tell you after just watching it, it didn't disappoint at all.The basic plot is this; Walter is a huge fan of The Muppets and travels with his brother Gary(Jason Segal) and his girlfriend Mary(Amy Adams) to Los Angelas to see the old Muppet theater. When he finds that a a business tycoon plans to destroy the theater to get oil underneath it, Walter meets Kermit the Frog and they all decide to get the gang back together to try and save the theater. Nearly all of the old gang is here as they get Fozzie, Gonzo, Sam, Animal, Miss Piggy etc. They need to raise 10,000,000 dollars in order to save the theater and bring the Muppets back in the limelight.This was a huge nostalgia trip for me. Seeing the Muppets on the big screen for the first time since I was a kid brought tears of joy to my eyes. The songs are what you'd expect from The Muppets: catchy, well written, and just a lot of fun. In typical form, a lot of celebrities make cameo appearances in this movie(Neil Patrick Harris, Whoopi Goldberg, Jack Black, Mickey Rooney etc.) and they're all done very well.I can go on and on about how this movie is just an all around great family film. Even if you or your kids have never even heard of the Muppets you can still have a great time watching the movie. There's something in it for everyone. The only real negative aspect I can think of is a few Muppets weren't really used to their potential and some didn't show up at all. But still, with a movie like this I'm willing to look over that issue. Everything in this movie is just near perfect. I can almost guarantee that you won't regret seeing this in theaters. Jim Henson would be proud.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Muppets movie is a enjoyable, funny movie. The moment I sat on my seat and began watching the movie I felt like a kid again, that's the magic The Muppets have. The film is simple but entertaining, the rhythm is slow but never boring. The music is great, with new songs and also with the all- time Muppets classics from the TV show. The performances were exactly the way they should be. Jason Segel and Amy Adams make a perfect couple on screen. Chris Cooper is a very hilarious villain. Watching Zack Galifianakis, Jack Black, Whoopi Goldberg, Jim Parsons and many more prestigious well known artists with special appearances was awesome.With this movie we can assure that good things never get old and The Muppets are a prove of that. If you're a Muppets fan, definitely you will enjoy the movie, if not give it a try you won't regret it</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Muppets movie was very great and lovable. I would recommend people of any age to see this.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first heard of "The Muppets" movie reboot, I truly had no major desire to see it. Having not been a big fan of them (because I was not alive when they were in their "heyday") there was no real urge for me to go and see it. Well with some twists and turns, I winded up going to watch the film.Right from the get-go I realized this movie was not just meant for children, and it was actually, surprisingly funny. The "Muppets" sarcastic humor and witty personalities add up to make one lovable, great film. On the down side, there were times during the film that I found myself dozing off. Maybe the cause of my fatigue was my lack of sleep, but I truly think at some points the movie just dragged on. Since this is a G rated film, that means there must be some "life lesson" moment during the film, which typically occurs once. Although in this movie, it was not a rare occasion to have the characters talk about how the lessons they learned will help them in life. Now while I am not saying this is a negative aspect, I just think they could have toned down those parts of the film.Overall, "The Muppets" was an extremely pleasant surprise to me. Jason Segel and Amy Adams (both who are always a delight) made the film that much better. I think I could boldly say that any adult who was a fan of "The Muppets" as a child, will find out that they did not disappoint in this motion picture.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Rainbow Connection.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the best film of 2011 without a doubt.The film is about Brothers Gary played by Jason Segal and Walter and Garys Girlfriend Mary played by Amy Adams are on a trip to Los Angeles for Gary and Marys anniversary and Walter Tags along to see the abandoned Muppet Studios. While there he finds out that an evil oil tycoon Tex Richman played by Chris Cooper finds a loophole in the standard rich and famous contract Kermit signed in The Muppet Movie(1979) that states That if Tex gets Kermit to sign over Mupets Studios they not only have to give up being famous but also give up the muppet name. Walter also finds out that Tex wants to drill for oil under the studio. Walter, Gary and Mary find Kermit and convince him to gather up all of the other Muppets to put on a show to raise $10,000,000.This has to be the movie that I have laughed the hardest at. The film has great songs like I've Got Everything That I Need, Me Party, Pictures In My Head and the funniest of them all Man Or Muppet featuring Jim Parsons from The Big Bang Theory. It Also contains Classic Muppet songs like Manamana and The Rainbow Connection. I cried twice during The Film once because I Was laughing so hard and the other was The Rainbow Connection Being so Happy that they not only brought back the song but because they did not mess it up like they did not mess up the movie. Definitely See it while it is in theaters because you need to have an audience around you to experience it. Just seeing your favorite characters is awesome. Also The only time I have been to a movie that received a 10 minute Standing Ovation At The end. For a Movie to achieve that Especially The Muppets is awesome. This is my favorite of the muppet movies and the best film of 2011.There is also A Toy Story Toon called Small Fry about toys being sold in a kids meal not being played with. It was very funny and I would be happy to see more of these. Yes I do know there is a Hawaiian Vacation one and that too was very funnyRated PG For Some Mild Rude Humor.1hr 38min/98min.****/****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>no expectations- perfectly awesome movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went with a small group of friends to see this during opening weekend. We all like the Muppets and were hopeful, but not expecting anything. We were all thrilled with it. Funny, smart, modern, Muppety, nostalgic and I think a perfect kick start to the Muppets. The best Muppet movie since the original three for certain! Several of us are going back to see it again. Also, some of the songs in the soundtrack are impossible to get out of your head. For anyone who hasn't kept up with the Muppets recently, most of the characters are performed by new puppeteers, with some exceptions. I think this is the best that Kermit has been since the late Jim Henson performed him. Also, scooter who was absent for so long is back and sounds his best. Only a few times did Miss Piggy and Fozzie Bear sound "off" to me, which was distracting in the moment, but overall they were great. Really, the only misstep in writing seemed to be Fozzie's fart shoes joke, which could have been acceptable if someone like Kermit replied with a "Really? Fozzie?" etc... Instead, it sort of hung there as a particularly poor taste joke for Fozzie. I saw this show in a large theater which was mostly full and it appeared everyone loved it. Lot's of laughter and applause at the end!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Imagine a bunch of 40 somethings that had never moved out of their mothers' basements and existed on nothing but Muppet TV and movie reruns, and then were given the chance to create a movie. However, they couldn't use any music from the series or the movies, they couldn't use the original voices, and they had to guarantee that every moment would be predictable, boring and horribly unfunny. The result would be The New Muppet Movie. I loved the original series, I really liked the first and third Muppet's movies - and tolerated the 2nd, but this movie is simply terrible. It uses continuing references to the 30 year old Muppet series, apparently assuming today's children have been reincarnated from the disco era. Even the brothers sequences seems terribly contrived and unworkable. I feel very sorry for Amy Adams because she will be apologizing for being in this movie until 2050. Do yourself a favor. Buy the original Muppet movie or Muppets Take Manhattan and save your eyes from this horror.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw the advance screening on Saturday and it was fabulous. I am so glad that the Muppets are back and better than ever like they did back in their glory days(1976-1989). The Muppet Show was originally made for adults to watch because of the dialogue and celebrity guests. The kids loved to watch it just because of the puppets. I noticed as I was watching it most of the adult audience were the ones laughing at the jokes. I can't wait for them to make a sequel and hopefully bring back The Muppet Show on TV so we can see more musical acts(old &amp; new), funny sketches &amp; celebrity guests. This movie is a real must see film. You'll love it like how it was back in 1976-1989.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ever since Jim Henson's untimely death in 1990, I always felt the Muppets over the years have lost some of their magic because they no longer had Henson's creative genius. But after seeing this movie I now feel that they got some of that magic back! The Muppets is a funny charming, and song filled spectacle, The Story centers around couple Gary and Mary (Jason Segel &amp; Amy Adams) along with Gary's brother Walter (who is a Muppet himself) Travel to LA to tour the Muppet Studios but find out that bad guy Tex Richman (Oscar winner Chris Cooper) wants to destroy the Muppet Theatre so he can dig for gold. The trio set out to find Kermit and the rest of the Muppets in order to save the theater. All your favorite Muppets are here. The songs are first rate, and its a joy to watch. There is somewhat of a passing of the torch with this movie because old favorites have new puppeteers and voices as Frank Oz and Jerry Nelson are not performing their characters but Steve Whitmire still voices Kermit and does a terrific job! This movie is a great way to introduce the Muppets to a new generation of viewers and holds a special place in the hearts of those who grew up with Jim Henson's creations. Sit back and enjoy the famous cameos which are trademarks in past Muppet movies and get sentimental when Kermit sings "The Rainbow Connection" again. Welcome back Muppets!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's time to watch THE MUPPETS!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>-- Ramascreen.com --THE MUPPETS makes me smile, makes me feel like a kid again. This film doesn't have a single dull moment, I love every minute! Genius songwriter Bret McKenzie (Flight of the Conchords) should get nominated for his catchy original songs Man or Muppet and Life's A Happy Song. I had my worries at first because the Forgetting Sarah Marshall team Jason Segel and Nicholas Stoller's brand of humor is in the same R-rated raunchy ring as Judd Apatow's but Segel and Stoller are very respectful to THE MUPPETS characters and this whole property. There's no innuendo and it's very family friendly. Folks of all ages will enjoy the humor. Neither Kermit, Miss Piggy, Fozzy, Gonzo nor Pepe are any different than the way remembered them growing up. And Walter is a fantastic latest addition to one of the most beloved gangs of all time? What's your childhood's favorite Muppets movie? The Muppets Takes Manhattan? The Muppets Christmas Carol? Muppets From Space? Well, this comeback movie beats all of those. The story is basically about Muppets getting their team back together to save their studio. Years have gone by and everybody's got their own separate lives, some successful, some not so much but their personalities, their habits are still intact, some may be repressed but it's there in them, waiting for the 'animal' side to be unleashed. Kermit and Miss Piggy still have that complicated adoration tension relationship. You can't not like those two. You know they care for each other, they care for the show, they care for the team but they're like old bickering married couple, Kermit often makes fun of Piggy and Piggy is too focused on herself to pay attention but that's the tie that binds, they will always end up together and they wouldn't have it any other way.Because THE MUPPETS has so many characters, just be ready for the fact that one or two of your favorites may not be getting much screen time but it's totally understandable in my book, because you gotta keep in mind that Jason Segel, Amy Adams, and the new puppet Walter are also part of the story, they're key characters as well. Segel deciding where his priorities are, Walter conflicted between joining the team and sticking by his human pal, and Adams feels neglected. You may get bombarded by the film's many moral messages and themes but I for one don't mind because that's what THE MUPPETS been about anyway, to let you know that you're awesome, that you belong, that everyone's got talent, that music always makes doing chores fun and the list goes on. The telethon takes you back to the old episodes, this is one that's not to be missed.I think the way this movie reintroduces these characters to today's generation is brilliant. In this day and age when everything is CG animation or hybrid, it's good to see old skool puppetry skill at work. You get newfound respect for that. And just like the old shows and the old movies, this movie too has a gazillion celebrity cameos and they aim to cheer you up. Oscar winner Chris Cooper is excellent as the bad guy Tex Rich and the humor that occasionally breaks fourth wall will invite you to be part of the joyous occasion. There's one cinematic set piece in the film that I really had fun watching, when Kermit sings and the paintings of his buddies all around him turn to life, kinda speaks in a way that reminds us that even if we haven't seen THE MUPPETS in a while, they're not entirely gone, they're still around, they're just not around as a team,.. until this movie comes along and makes that reunion possible. And I think this whole thing is a major success mostly because it's handled by people who truly love THE MUPPETS and have been genuine fans ever since they could remember.-- Ramascreen.com --</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ugly Stereotyping</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I live in Texas and felt uncomfortable watching this movie with my 5 year old. The movie includes ugly stereotyping against Texans, particularly against those working in the oil and gas industry.It is hard for me to understand the use of the word "Tex" in Tex Richman, which is depicted as a rich but miserable oilman. The Tex Richman works at the top of a high rise with nasty looking muppets and keeps courtesans in his closet. He plans to drill for oil under the Muppets Theater, which would be in downtown LA somewhere according to the movie.The movie is full of misrepresentations. The worst is these misrepresentations are made to children who cannot judge them, and to unsuspecting parents who think they are taking their kids to a harmless holiday movie.It is unfortunate how The Muppets movie can be used as a platform for cheap political propaganda. The producers of this movie likely consume energy just like the rest of the Americans, without having much regard for where it comes from. I wish people stopped pointing fingers calling each other Tex Richmen, or Tree Huggers, and really thought about solutions for the nation's energy needs. In any case, The Muppets movie is probably not the best platform for this debate.</fullReview>
