		<shortDescription>Being a jackass looks fun...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Jackass the Movie" defies just about every set law of film-making. It is rude, it is crude, and it is doggone hilarious. I can't really think of words to describe this film as none do so adequately. It is, of course, based upon the popular television show on MTV of the same name (except there's no "the Movie" on the end of it). Basically it is "Candid Camera" meets the X-Games meets drunkards. Its cast are a bunch of jackasses: Johnny Knoxville, Bam Margera, Chris Pontius, Wee Man the Midget, Ryan Dunn, and Steve-O. They go around pulling various pranks, and sometimes - or most of the time - injuring themselves.The humor is very selective - some will hate it and others (mainly stoned teens) will love it. Take, for instance, a gag where one of the men walks into a plumbing store and relieves himself into a display toilet. Things such as this have been insinuated before on a commercial I remember for Best Buy, but this movie shows everything - in detail - including the feces inside the toilet bowl.Sound disgusting? Well it is. But some of the gags - for I can think of no other word to describe them - are just downright hilarious. For example, the co-creator of the TV series, Johnny Knoxville, borrows a car from a rental lot, takes it to a garage, has all the gears messed up and windows smashed, spray paints it, and then enters it into a car derby. He takes it back to the lot all smashed up and refuses to pay for the damage. He admits that he was drinking before it happened. He says they must help them pay for the damage to the vehicle. They point out that he signed a contract declaring that he would pay for all responsible damage, and he says, "Yeah, but I had a little to drink when I signed that, too."The cast and crew seem to have not grown past the age of 13 in terms of maturity. One of the best gags involves about four men on a golf course blasting air horns during tee-offs. One golfer gets so angered that he throws a golf club at them and starts to actually tee off at the men (who are hiding behind trees on the course).I've never quite witnessed something like "Jackass the Movie" before. It is like a giant unedited TV show stretched out to a full 80 + minutes, and let me say that this is the first time in history I have seen a TV-show-based film that I thought was too short. (Movies like "Night at the Roxbury" seem to go on forever.) "Jackass the Movie" is lots of fun - it isn't deep or intellectual, but it's fun. This film is definitely going to gross-out certain people, and enthuse the more wacky crowds out there. But it is one of the most "technically" entertaining films of the year. It isn't a masterpiece but it is very fun to watch. Maybe I'm an immature sicko, but I liked this movie.Before the film starts, there is a warning which reads something like "the stunts performed herein are executed by trained professionals." Let me ask: How does one train to be a jackass? This film doesn't tell us, but it sure does show us what trained jackasses are like. And you know what? Being a jackass looks fun.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Quite simply, the scariest movie ever made. This includes the likes of the Seventh Seal and Working Out with Zsa Zsa Gabor. What our fellow man will do to himself to get a cheap laugh is beyond me, but it tends to work in multiple fashions. Johnny, Steve-O, Wee Man, Party Boy, Bam, Preston Lacy, Dave, Ehren and all the other fellas in this film will never win anything but my self respect. It takes guts to get hit by a tidal wave machine, go up against Butterbean and eat a urine-soaked sno-cone. While many will attribute this as a factor to the continuing downfall of society, at least it was damn funny (even with multiple viewings). Never has a film actually induced me to nearly vomit. Not for the tasteful and high faluting type.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>About the only thing that can be safely said about the gross-out fest `Jackass ? The Movie' is that it is definitely an acquired taste. You will be either delighted or appalled by the masochistic antics contained in this film, and if you ever needed proof that there is a distinct cultural divide existing in this nation today, `Jackass' provides it in spades.For those who do not know, `Jackass' is the brainchild of Johnny Knoxville and his assorted buddies who have made a lucrative industry out of devising and performing death- and injury-defying stunts so that likeminded individuals, from the comfort and safety of their couches and theater seats, can at least get a vicarious thrill by watching others act out what they themselves wish they had the nerve (or stupidity) to do. (The film, of course, comes with a `don't try this at home' proviso that is as transparently insincere as it is obviously ineffective). `Jackass' is like the ultimate boys-will-be-boys extravaganza, a fifth grade prankster's dream come true. Not only do the `men' perform the stunts, but they spend most of their time in convulsive hysterics responding to them. On-screen vomiting, defecating, intentional bloodletting and the imbibing of urine are just a few of the goodies offered up for the audience's delectation by the makers of the film. Think of this as the dark side of the Peter Pan Syndrome, a tribute to adult men who have serious maturity issues and who clearly refuse `to grow up.'Like most compilation films, `Jackass ? The Movie' is a hit-and-miss proposition. Some of the `stunts' are clever and amusing, and there is a certain anarchic kick to be derived from seeing these guys pushing back the boundaries of conventional common sense and good taste. But there's also a certain mean-spirited tone to so much of what we see on screen that it interferes with our enjoyment of vast portions of the movie. Personally, I don't care if these guys want to injure, maim or even kill themselves to get their kicks, but why do they have to get so many of their laughs at the expense of other people? A number of the `bits' seem designed to do little more than humiliate hardworking business people, innocent bystanders and even members of their own families. In making a cruel version of `Candid Camera,' the filmmakers only heighten their own smugness and attitude of superiority, helping to alienate all but the group's most fanatical followers. What also surprises me ? given the general nature of the film's target audience, that is ? is just how homoerotic in tone many of these stunts turn out to be. I'm not saying that as a judgment against the film, but I do find it to be an interesting observation.I don't want to belabor the issues too much here, and I certainly don't believe that the success of this film (and the TV show that spawned it) in any way foretells the imminent collapse of Western Civilization, as others have charged. That is clearly an overreaction. `Jackass ? The Movie' is obviously intended for a very specific niche audience and, in those terms, I guess, it gets the job done. Just make sure you're in that niche before spending your hard-earned money to see it. You've been forewarned.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The first movie I actually wanted to walk out of!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*SPOILERS*-A couple of the stunts pulled off are mentioned.I'll start off by saying that I was convinced to go to this movie by some friends of mine. While I knew I probably wouldn't totally like this movie, my feelings of it afterwards were far worse of not liking it. I am not one to usually walk out of movies, but, I couldn't stand this one. The only problem is that I couldn't leave because my ride was greatly enjoying the film.The humor in this film is so low and gross. These guys have staked their reputation on being of the lowest form of human kind. I can respect dumb humor like this but only so far. From sticking things up their butts, to attaching a firecracker to a guys penis, and to pulling crude pranks and painful pranks on innocent people, this movie has not due credit and should be classified as complete trash. There were many times when I found myself closing my eyes or leaning toward the floor to throw up (and I consider myself to have a decently strong stomach).The making of such trash like this gives us a look into our society, of how low can we really go and still get people's money. This movie has reached all lows and I feel totally violated. Not worth a penny.This movie has no merit to it and I regret falling into the peer pressure of going to see this heap of garbage. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY-1/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Want to spend 87 minutes of your life watching a pathetic group hurting themselves in a senseless way? Jackass: The Movie is a perfect movie to do that. Its a movie that people either hate it or love it instantly. And I'm a proud person to say that I love it. Some funny scenes, gross-out scenes, and some that are just... TOO GROSS! But after the credits roll, you got to think, "How could they possibly do that?" Just to make people laugh. 9.5 stars out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>1st watched 9/3/2006 - 2 Out of 10(Dir-Jeff Tremaine): Stupid people doing stupid stunts and it's supposed to be funny? I'm sorry but I didn't get the humor in this right after the credits. The best parts of the movie were the opening credits where the gang flys down a street in an over-sized shopping carts while explosions go off around them and they begin pelting each other as debris pelts them and the music booms in coordination with the pelts. After the ending credits, we get to see old versions of them going thru the same type of thing in a fake trailer for the Sons of Jackass. These two scenes had some humor, but most everything in between(for approximately 80 minutes) was worthless garbage consisting of jackasses doing stunts to hurt themselves and their bodies with fat jokes thrown in every so often. When a character poops in a hardware store toilet and they show a close-up of the poop, please enough is enough?. And I can't remember how many times I got to see various characters barfing various colors of stuff right in front of me.(wow, was that fun?not) Why Johnny Knoxville and his gang would allow themselves to be the subjects of one pain-inducing torture after another is beyond me.(I guess it's a macho thing..) As I watched, I kept saying why? Why the premise? Why the show ?? Why the movie?? Why a following that produced a movie ?? Why did I rent this and pay money for it?? Why's and more why's?.and guess what their's going to be a sequel? but why??</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When Jackass scraped across the screens of MTV viewers, people were both disgusted and left rolling on the floor laughing... at the same time. Never before has a show gone so far to make us laugh with experimental slapstick comedy that goes there. Then the film came out... and its non-stop, laugh-till-your-throat-hurts, vomit-till-your-stomach's-dry comedy. There are no stunt-men, no stand-ins... not even a high-tech camera... THIS is Jackass, and it still manages to make us 'ooh' and 'oh my god' plus 'HAHAHAHAHAHHAHA!!!' without tire or wear.... Cheers, you Jackass... you earned it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think the following comment is overwhelming " Johnny Knoxville and his crazy friends appear on the big screen for the very first time in Jackass: The Movie. They wander around Japan in panda outfits, wreak havoc on a once civilized golf court, they even do stunts involving LIVE alligators, and so on. While Johnny Knoxvile and his pals put their life at risk, they are entertaining people at the same time. Get ready for Jackass: The Movie!! "I haven't seen the second sequel of this movie yet but I'm really disappointed of the first one, so why wasting my time in an immoral unethical pathetic movie Why? If we remove some of the (rare) "clean" funny scenes of this movies it becomes a pure R rated piece of crap! Because this movie is not just an offense to mankind but it also defines humans as unstoppable crazy animals!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ever see a movie called Idiocracy? A film that takes place in the future as we see what our society has become due to the lack of intelligence in film, television, doctor's direction in finding a cure for baldness vs. the cure for cancer, etc. I think Mike Judge had the show Jackass in mind when he wrote that film. Jackass was a show started on MTV that I don't know how, just became very popular. Apparently men hitting their nuts with random objects is very entertaining. But the other day I wanted to watch a movie and my boyfriend brought up Jackass, I decided to go for it, what do I have to loose? Now I knew what I signed up for, after all just look at the title. It starts with the opening credits as the guys are rolling into the set on a shopping cart with epic battle music playing which I have to admit I got a good kick out of, so I thought how bad could this be? Then they start getting hit with cement and are hitting and kicking each other, but I stood strong and held on tight for this movie and God help me, I survived.Johnny Knoxville and his group of friends get together to pull a bunch of gags that will make you gag. Just imagine a bunch of drunk frat boys that have too much time on their hands and can only think of their gentiles and behinds as the only answer to any prank.I tried, I really tried, I'm one of the most liberal people you will ever meet. My opinion is as long as it's not hurting anyone, let people do what they want. But I honestly just couldn't find this funny. The only thing I laughed at and felt so dirty laughing was when Johnny and his friends dressed up as the elderly and do random things like shoplift and go running down a hill in their wheel chair. Seeing the people's reactions was just priceless. Party Guy is kind of funny too, even though I had a bad experience a few years ago with someone who dressed up as Party Guy at a Halloween party. One of those things where it's funny to see it happen to someone else as long as it's not you. With Johnny and his friends just laughing maniacally at everything bad that happens to their friends, I just found it more annoying. I feel so bad and uptight saying this, but I have to say that nothing about this movie was enjoyable or entertaining. When I was watching it with my boyfriend, he wasn't laughing, I thought it was because I wasn't, but he said he couldn't laugh, that he found it funny in high school, but not so much now. I think maybe Jackass was just a trend that led up to those wonderful videos on youtube.People who harm animals or themselves for the sake of laughs is just stupid. I know this is the title, but it worries me that people find this show/movie amusing. It shows that our intelligence is decreasing and our attention span is the length of a peanut. I guarantee you that in 10 to 15 years, these guys are going to have a lot of problems and it's not going to be so funny then. I guess maybe either I'm not as liberal as I thought or I'm just too smart for this kind of humor.2/10</fullReview>

This has got to be the worst movie I've ever seen. Total crap.

Would I give this anything but a 1 star? No. I neither asks for or deserves anything but a 1 star. Battlefield earth has more quality than this. Howard the Duck is a masterpiece against it. This is a movie that is based on entertainment alone.One thing is for sure, virtually no replay value. Purely a rental piece.1/10Quality: 0/10 Entertainment: 6/10 Replayable: 1/10</fullReview>

They had an opportunity here to make an unprecented reality-film but they kept it at a mere montage of some uninspiring and bland clips to cash in on the Jackass-concept.Had they continued the film in the style of the first 10 minutes and added something like a plot or story, this could have been a lot more fun.</fullReview>

Please tell me who in their right mind thinks this is funny, because if they do they seriously need to get their head examined. Or at the very least need a life. I have watched all and I mean ALL kinds of movies and have never been more turned off by the IDIOTIC, TOTALLY WRECKLESS and DANGEROUS acts these idiots perform. I can just imagine how many preteens and teenagers that watched this stupid movie and perhaps thought to them selves, "hey, so and so, I dare you to jump from that condominium roof top into the pool, Jackass style?" Which by the way really did happen, was video taped by a friend and the kid missed the water by 24 inches breaking his legs in the act. We all saw it on the news when cops took the video as evidence and released it to the news reporters. And these acts with animals like bulls, sharks, snakes and alligators just to name a few and then stand there in front of the camera laughing like a bunch of STUPID, RETARDED IDIOTS is so outright dangerous I think they should BAN these idiots from making these films. WHY?? because we have children, and anyone under 18 is considered a child, watching these acts and not all, Thank God, but you and I know that there are few out there just waiting for the moment (no parents or guardians around) when they see the opportunity to "just try it out to see what will happen". I just think this goes beyond the line of sanity and shudder of the thought that a bored, naive child will be urged, dared or coerced by his so-called friends to do a stupid act "Jack Ass Style".</fullReview>

However this movie made me think twice about being liberal on what can be shown on the screen or not. With the vandalism going on in our cities, this is exactly what I don't want to be shown to young folks who are easily impressed and consider the displayed activities cool. The disclaimer at the beginning is nothing but a legal figleaf - I think we all know that we'll see the young and stupid follow up on what they've seen here. The movie has no redeeming artistic value, it's about as funny as it would be to watch kitties being tortured with a blowtorch and the thought that the morons acting in it are not doing jail time or community service until they grow up is an itch I can't scratch. My suggestion would be to confiscate the revenue from this movie and put it in a fund to repair damage done by vandalism in our communities.</fullReview>

It's also a bit of a cheek calling it a movie when there's no actual plot -- just sketches of insanity -- and no real talent either (although not recommended, anyone could do the things here).There are also some sketches that are simply tedious repeats of others (albeit in a different setting), meaning that it is even more of a con. And it's not even all that funny either (I certainly wasn't exactly rolling about splitting my sides); it's just juvenile.What a waste of film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Even with very little expectation in mind, this movie proved to be a disappointment. My wife and I got to the second scene and could stand no more. These kind of gags belong on the cutting room floor of a fraternity dark room. It doesn't take much for a group of guys to come up with different ways to hurt themselves on screen. Perhaps some liked the mindless antics they were showing. I have a reality check for those that sat and watched the whole show. The biggest joke they pulled was getting you to purposefully open your wallet or purse to support their stupidity. Anyone for a couple additions to the Darwin Awards?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am a fan of the Jackass TV show. I went to see the movie only knowing that it would contain stunts not permitted on television. Some of the things on the TV show are bad, but much of it is fine.This movie should have been NC-17. If it had got the rating it deserved, I would not have seen it.Don't get me wrong, I really like the TV series, most of it at least. Some of the stunts in the film were pretty good, but almost all of them were quite bad.It is possible that scenes may have been cut to avoid an NC-17 rating, but this film is a perfect example of why I think that the MPAA's 'monopoly' over movie ratings should end. I think that movies should get a second opinion over their content.</fullReview>

It really bothers me that anyone over the age of 10 would find this film even remotely amusing or funny. It says a lot about where our society (especially young men and women) is headed. The biggest joke about this film is the fact that you actually paid money to see it. The "jokes" in the film are mean spirited, crass, destructive and not funny.

		<fullReview>I would have ignored this film except for the slew of very excited reviews that said it was the funniest thing since "South Park: Bigger, Longer, and Uncut."Let me tell you a secret. "South Park" was a masterpiece of comic amusement. "Jackass" isn't.I knew what to expect; I'm not a prude or anything and, in fact, this movie didn't offend me at all. I was a little grossed out by the vomit but I'm more squeamish about that than most. To tell the truth, everything in this "movie" lost its potency because of the washed-out grainy video look. If they had shot it on film, and had a more professional look to it, it could have been a lot more interesting to watch, even with the exact same stuff on screen.I suspect the average person, sans unhealthy fascination with bodily functions or unusual amusement at physical humor (that latter would be characterized by thinking Adam Sandler is the funniest thing on film), would just be bored by this pic.So, unless you're a big "Jackass" fan or are really itching to see more bodily fluids and people getting hurt on video, you're not going to enjoy this film, so do yourself a favor and stay home.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I Wasn't That Impressed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to say that I only saw the show a few times and thought it had some pretty funny stuff in it. I had no ambition of seeing this in the theaters but recently rented it on video. Before renting it, I read the reviews on Screenit.com and on this site. I was laughing when I read about some of the things they did in this movie because it sounded really funny. Then I saw it...I think that the people who were dying laughing must have been watching some other movie because it just wasn't that funny. A lot of the things that I was laughing reading about were just plain stupid and didn't even evoke a smile from me. Most of the humorous thing involved the "victimless" stuff like the golf cart jumping, the Party Boy skits and teh old people in their scooters. Knoxville had some pretty funny skits like his fight with Butterbean, but it reminded me a lot of a high school click where there is one popular person (Knoxville) and a lot of uncool people who want to be like him so they imitate the things he does. Steve-O was pretty unfunny but the absolute worst was Bam. That guy tried way too hard to make someone laugh and it didn't work. All in all, it was not that good and you could probably have more laughs watching The Jamie Kennedy experiment or America's Funniest Home Videos. I honestly don't understand how even fans got a good laugh out of this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, I waited 10 years to finally watch this, and being 71, it was not likely that I would find it hilarious, but it was far less funny than I thought it would be. Aside from the opening car-rental skit and the golf course skit, I never "lol"ed. Before anyone thinks I'm just too old, let me say I found (and still do) "The Groove Tube", "Dumb and Dumber", "Airplane", "Something About Mary", "The Meaning of Life", and "Top Secret", intermittently extremely funny, and I was in a frat in college for a couple of years. But I have never found people getting hurt hilarious, either accidentally or on purpose, which accounts for much of the "humor" of this piece of junk. This was ultimately just a bunch of drunk-acting frat boys doing stupid pranks on each other or unsuspecting strangers. Kind of an elaborate version of putting a whoopee-cushion under an unsuspecting visitor and laughing your head off when the noise goes off. Perfect if your sense of humor is stunted at about age 12 or 13. It is a sad commentary on our society that late teens (mostly males) are so bored and so jaded and so immature that something like this can pass as great entertainment and spawn a number of sequels. Pathetic! Update: Surprisingly, I found "Bad Grandpa", by the same production crew, hilarious, which shows that you never can tell.</fullReview>

I suppose it goes to show how easy it is to steal from the stupid.I know and understand quite well that humor is meant to be brainless and funny, but people making the comment that this is the best movie ever don't deserve to watch another movie for as long as they live. Humor comes in three forms. Unexpected, completely exaggerated or sarcasm. Unfortunate true comedians such as George Carlin, who is one of the most sarcastic people alive, is lost on all the stupid people in society who feel it is funny to watch someone shove things in their butts, crap their pants or eat their own waste. To all those who find that funny, why don't you go do these things if they're so funny? If you even have a shread of intelligence you'd know you wouldn't because these things are just another sign that our society is going to hell. Anyone who finds this funny should be locked up.

The truly sad thing is that amidst all the puke, fecal matter and dangerously unfunny fireworks displays...Johnny Knoxville gives us the odd hint that there is an actually brilliant comedic mind at work in there. Rather than continue to explore the truly funny ideas which require some forethought and set-up however (i.e. professional make-up artists making the gang look like old men...then crashing their electric scooters in the streets...or an elaborate domino-effect ending that fails on many levels), JACKASS too often falls back on the grotesque and juvenile schticks (anal insertions, crapping and fighting) that require no brains. I can't say the same thing for all the retards in this movie...but if Johnny ever matures a little bit he just may have the makings of a career in comedic film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The movie that rendered the MPAA obsolete</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(This review contains minor spoilers; although Jackass has no plot to speak of, a lot of it does work on the element of surprise).It's very appropriate that Jackass: the Movie features a cameo by Rip Taylor, onetime host of the infamous, and tasteless, $1.98 Beauty Pageant, because in many ways this film is the modern day successor of those tasteless Chuck Barris shows of years ago. It is also appropriate that this "film" is partly shot in Japan, where half the TV schedule, it seems, is filled with programming dedicated to people pulling life-threatening, not to mention stupid, stunts.It's difficult to know what to say about Jackass except, perhaps, to advise people not to load up on food at the concession stand. This is perhaps the crudest mainstream movie ever produced, and in fact it contains sequences that would have gotten this film banned 5 years ago. Scenes of real human feces and vomit, like those seen in this movie, were restricted to fetish porn Web sites before Paramount (PARAMOUNT?) let them escape in this film.Once you get past the gag factor (take that literally) of some of the sequences, there are some very funny moments, such as a sequence where the cast dress up as giant panda bears and go nightclubbing in Tokyo. There are also a few scenes that are decidedly not funny, including one where one of the cast humilates his obese father in the bathroom (though his poor mom does generate one of the funniest scenes when she's filmed coming home to discover a surprise in her kitchen). The "climax" of the film, the last sequence before the extended closing credits, has to be a first in American film history.Technically speaking, Jackass is rather poor. Like The Blair Witch Project, most of the movie was shot on video (since most of the footage consists of outtakes from the MTV TV series), giving the movie a very cheap, blurred quality. But I guess for this film, it's appropriate.What is NOT appropriate is the rating the MPAA gave this picture. If you need any evidence that the MPAA system is obsolete, it's the fact they gave this movie an R-rating, instead of an NC-17. Real feces, shots of guys zapping their testicles with electricity, and more than a few vomit scenes, and it gets an R, while a charming film like Amelie, which features only minor nudity, also gets an R instead of a PG-13. What gives?I sincerely believe that the MPAA will find it harder to justify slapping an unwanted NC-17 or R rating on movies, now that directors are able to call upon the Jackass defence.Jackass is going to be a very popular party DVD ... but I wouldn't recommend it as a first date movie, or one to see after eating a full meal.</fullReview>

It's basically a waste of film. I rather have my self beaten to death by Michael Wincott on a Thursday afternoon by a swing set while Dan Hedeya watched with a puzzled face. I went to see this film-trash with my simple-minded girlfriend. She enjoyed it. I can't believe that i didn't notice that she was an idiot until now. Since she loved the movie, i dumped her.

Don't get me wrong, i like the show. But, this movie is completely horrible on all levels. First off, WHY WOULD YOU WANT TO SEE A TV SHOW IN THEATERS? All they did was put their worst stunts on the screen and called it a movie. The movie should be called "JACKASS: The worst of the worst", or "JACKASS: The worthless movie". How could of this movie make 22mil on it's opening weekend? That shows how stupid America is getting. What ever happened to the idea of putting out a good movie in theaters? The movie watchers are just taking the easy way out in life, by not turning on their brains. While watching this filth, I felt like gouging out my eyes, and screaming out for Charles Dance and Charles S. Dutton to come and save me. But, i resorted burning my self with my lighter to vent my anger, witch was the most pleasure the I got from entering the theater this day. So, please, don't rent this movie, do it for your futures! Go out and rent good movies! If you like comedies, go watch classics like Uncle Buck, What about Bob? Trading places, Christmas Vacation, Coming to America, etc..... There are plenty of them out there. So instead of following the crowd, and renting Jackass, don't be one, and go rent something good.Until later....Shhh</fullReview>

It depends of your idea of good, if it is guys doing stunts, gangs and be Jack asses for around 84 minutes then that's a flick that you have fun with. But if you have faith of heart then don't see it for any reason ,for some of the scenes are too disgusting even for me and I have what lions kill threw strangulation since I was nine! And of course don't watch with your girlfriend ,if you want to have one!Is it funny? Hilarious the boys understood the essence of the wolf pack seven years before Hangover make it famous.

		<fullReview>The original Jackass film coming from the popular MTV television show arrived in theaters in 2002 and made a ton of money, which warranted it two more sequels. This film however was not as great nor entertaining as its sequel. There were very many little individual gags which could have been done without, and several gross out gags which weren't funny in the least. Though, there were still some funny and entertaining stuns, but majority of the film was not funny. Jackass Number Two being better than the original is a sign of growth and shows that they become more creative and energetic within their stunts. Some decent stunts and gags in this film include: golf course airhorn, the gong, nighttime panda skit. The weakest stunts were the gross out gags.</fullReview>

And when money speaks louder than judgment or logic, it happen these shameful and unfortunate films, that should never have even been imagined. Not worth wasting my time to analyze what went wrong in this movie because EVERYTHING went the hard way that could run. This is not a movie, isn't worthy of these name. It's garbage, pure waste of time for those who see it and worse, it had sequelae! It's like those pests that affect plants and never come out of there!When trying to see this film (I couldn't for more than ten minutes, I think we need to be totally devoid of intelligence to be able to see it completely!), I found myself reflecting on the decay of the human race. We are at a time when we could be all, achieve knowledge as never had and improve our behavior through more human and beneficial values. But we are wasting these opportunity choosing to worship the idiocy and stupidity. This film, and all that followed, is proof of that. I hope that Darwin is right and natural selection do its job properly, for the good of humanity.P.S.: I gave this movie a star because IMBb's system does not allow us to rate below zero to a movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jackass: The Movie (2002): Dir: Jeff Tremaine / Cast: Johnny Knoxville, Steve O, Jason "Wee Man" Acuna, Chris Pontius, Bam Margera: Product of M-T.V. with a group acting out bizarre stunts to the appeal of our mischievous level in younger years. Pure spectacle without plot yet the concept has appeal. Its structure is a series of stunts all separated by a fading screen. We witness urination on a snow cone before it is digested. Other stunts include smash up derby with rental cars, golf cart wars, a boxing fight within a department store. One of the guys has a bowel movement in his pants before finishing in a brand new toilet. This is witness by shocked employees. There is an X-ray that reveals a toy car in someone's anal track. There is tight rope walking above a pit of alligators. And finally there is an electric shock treatment applied to the penis. Director Jeff Tremaine films it like a bad documentary, which works for the humour element. Among the crusade that perform these acts are Johnny Knoxville, Steve O, Jason "Wee Man" Acuna, Bam Margera, and Chris Pontius who catch our attention despite our urge to resist. They tap into that willing urge to sin like the child wondering if he can obtain the cookie from the cookie jar without getting caught. Pointless wretch aimed at the wrong audience. As if there is actually a right audience for this sort of thing. Score: 7 / 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jackass the Movie is a spin off from the television series and is more explicit.The film would be popular with teenagers and stoners but for others it is an acquired taste as group of men take part in bizarre stunts, sometimes injuring themselves and with Candid Camera type antics which might be genuine or a set up with all the participants being in on the joke.Some of the physical stunts include tropical pole vaulting, stunt cycling/skateboarding, tightrope walking under alligators. You have stunts such as stock car racing with a rental car, setting fireworks off from your backside, getting beaten up by a boxer or kick boxer and some of the weird ones includes a man going to a hardware store and defecating in the display toilet and that is after he seemingly crapped in his pants getting there.The film will horrify some, sicken others, a few will find it hilarious. A couple of the sketches are genuinely funny such as the golfers getting disturbed by an air horn but mainly the feature film format is just overlong and you try to figure out which of the hidden camera parts are real and which are a fake.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can still remember enjoying this one in the theater, surrounded by a crowd who knew what they were in for and delighted in every minute of it. That's still probably the best environment for this movie, though it also serves decently enough as a solo adventure. Wonderfully self-aware, it doesn't change a thing about what made the Jackass TV show so wildly successful, apart from upping the ante and lowering itself to a sick new standard of profanity. This crew is like a squad of old friends, gross and fun to be around, but also heavily influential in how you see yourself. I'd shake my head and click away if I stumbled across half of these stunts on YouTube today, but because it feels like I know these guys, and they're so clearly having the time of their lives cashing those fifteen minutes, it's absurdly easy to buy in and let the belly laughs sail. Repeat viewings are probably best staggered at seven-to-ten year intervals.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>People With a Shared Sense of Humor Will Laugh Harder Than Ever Before. But That's It.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm giving it an 8, not because it's a good movie, but because it is one of the most entertaining films I've ever seen in my entire life.Before watching this movie, you've got to ask yourself : Do you enjoy crude, unintelligent, slapstick humor? For example, do you think a man getting run over by a buffalo herd is funny? Does idiots doing crazy **** and getting themselves half killed in the process amuse you? I understand that a lot of people will find this incredibly stupid and unfunny. Those people have no reason to watch this film.Although, the majority will find the sheer craziness of this film hilarious. Yes, I enjoy well thought out, intelligent humor but let's face it, sometimes we all just want to laugh at something completely ridiculous. And that's what Jackass is. Whether you're watching a an midget bar fight or a guy being assaulted by a goat whilst playing a trumpet, this film will keep you laughing throughout the entire 84 minutes.To what I say to you critics : Lay off. This wasn't supposed to a movie with great plot, outstanding acting(No acting is involved, it's all real) with great special effects and suspense. No, this film was supposed to be completely insane and ridiculous. And that it is. And it appeals to the majority of the public who enjoy this humor. In conclusion. This movie lacks plot, effects and is completely insane. And that's what will appeal to majority. Some of you will hate this film but a lot of you will laugh your ass off. Jackass : You've got to love it or hate it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am a 39 year old father of 3, and I saw the movie by myself. I haven't laughed so hard or so long in a movie theater in my life. In a regular comedy you have periods of laughter with long periods of just sitting there. With "JACKASS" you have loooong periods of laughter with periods of calm so you can calm down. I laughed so hard that my pancreas hurt. I had to pull over several times on the way home so I wouldn't crash because I was laughing so hard. The movie was at 7:45 pm. I started laughing at 7:46. I finally stopped laughing at 1:30 in the morning. I highly recommend this movie. It definitely not for kids though.</fullReview>

Jackass was mindless (literally!), stupid, waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay out there fun. I will agree that not everyone should see this - it is seriously immature. But come on! Imagine walking into a hardware store, dropping your drawers and.....maybe it's the shock value that makes it so hilarious. The fact that very - VERY - few of us would EVER have the guts (or even desire?!) to pole vault into a canal with a dead cat floating in it or snort wasabi (I need a pick me up!).

Either I've never matured or the stuff the Jackasses pull off is just hilarious. I'll go for the latter. This movie is impossible to review without giving away spoilers since it's so completely random and void of a plot. So what I can say is that you'll laugh (either at least chuckle or urinate in your pants), cringe, wonder why they did that stunt, (gag, almost gag, or want to gag) and wonder how the hell these guys had the guts to do what they did.I have a feeling that everyone likes this movie, whether they admit it or not.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Holy toledo, too many closed-minded and moronic pessimistic haters saying false things about this movie! It's not your typical movie. Of course there's a minimal story, it's an 85 minute "Jackass" episode. The characters are the cast from the infamous hit MTV show.So many laughs during this movie. A bunch of brave men, I'd say. Doing heroic things that most people don't even have the guts to do. Sure, there are disgusting scenes in it, some painful comic violence, and the stunts they do can be completely absurd at times. The whole point is that it's for your entertainment, that's why they are so appealing to watch!Henry Rollins, Tony Hawk, Eric Esch, Bam Margera's friends &amp; parents, George Hruska, Naoko Kumagai, and Mat Hoffman make wonderful cameo appearances in the process of their production.I completely respect Jeff Tremaine, Johnny Knoxville, Ryan Dunn (R.I.P.), Chris Pontius, and all the other Jackass cast &amp; crew. Never has a documentary full of brilliant people attempting to do dumb stuff been so experimental that it ironically succeeds.This movie has high replay value and I feel honored to own a copy of it on DVD. Don't take it seriously, laugh, enjoy the Jackass cast, and you'll have a fun night!</fullReview>

Well,It's funny, crude, rude, raunchy, full of explicit content and language, and very fun to watch.Fans of the series should be very pleased with this movie and it's far superior sequel.If you love to see guys hurting and humiliating themselves,this movie is perfect for you.If you hate disgusting humor that includes full frontal male nudity,then avoid this movie at all costs.</fullReview>

I am a big fan of both Jonny Knoxville and his Jackass series and Bam and his CKY/Viva La Bam series. So I looked forward to seeing the movies. However neither was a good as their shows.Although though Jackass was funny it's more stuff to cringe over in pain and disgust. It's a manly 'movie' of boyish competition. If you want to see real humor watch Les 11 commandments. It's basically a french more hilarious version of Jackass.Don't get me wrong Jackass is defiantly worth seeing.

It is so hilarious, that when I first watched it, I fell out of my seat about 6 times because of laughing so hard. This is really something to enjoy watching if you want to see a bunch of morons doing crazy stunts and pulling hilarious practical jokes on pedestrians and police officers and stuff, but some stuff might make you vomit. Such as one stunt "The Yellow Snowcone." There you go, enough said. And if you're a strait dude, I'd say, don't watch some of the stuff, because a lot of things in the movie are a little bit on the homo side.But this is definitely something to watch when you need a good laugh.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jackass, as we know, is a MTV show where a bunch of qualified and not so qualified stunt men and women put themselves through all manor of extremes for our entertainment (and often disgust). Having been a fan of the series I was intrigued how they could raise the bar suitably for the big screen, and whether the uncinematic format would be translated to the silver screen. After all on TV we witnessed everything from the human barbecue, being shot with a tazzer and various skateboard falls and bumps. Well I can happily inform you that like watching the film is just like watching the TV show?. Only a little more extreme. There's no plot, no Knoxville fighting against the forces of evil to secure the love of his life? just a selection of random falls, breaks, injuries and stunts that impress and scare in equal measure. Special note must go to the golf cart injuries, the non-lethal bullet, the tightrope walking and the opening giant shopping cart/masonry cannon skits. Knoxville has said that this film represents the swang song for Jackass? but I doubt that, after an opening weekend of ?40 million in the US (over doubling the films budget) that this will be the last we hear from Jackass.This film is funny. Side splittingly so. If you like this kinda thing. If you don't it probably wont win any new fans or convert you but Jackass represents non-pretentious fun and one of the most humorous films I have seen in some years. I personally (as did the cinema crowd behind me) laughed from start to finish? but that's just me. Be warned however this film isn't for the light of heart or weak of stomach?.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A bunch of wild and crazy funny stunt-mens (Johnny Knoxville, Bam Margera, Steve-O, Chris Pontius, Ryan Dunn, Jason "Wee-Man" Acuna, Preston Lacy, Dave Englund and Ehren McGhehey). They play dangerous stunts on themselves and unexpected civilians. Also by making practical jokes and doing sick humour to their unique brand of immature humour that making them instant cult figures on MTV by making their first movie.Directed by Jeff Tremaine (Jackass Number Two) brings their outrageous style of comedy to the big screen, which is surprisingly funny and quite provocative at times. Although the film does take time to start, but once the fun really starts and the picture makes up for the flaws early on.DVD has an sharp anamorphic Widescreen (1.78:1) transfer and an fine Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. DVD has two commentaries tracks. Commentary one is the director, cinematographer and actor/stunt-man:Knoxville. Commentary two is the Jackass group. DVD also includes behind the scenes featurettes, deleted scenes, original "failed" ending and the original theatrical trailer. At times, the humour is so disgusting that is not for the squeamish. Filmmaker:Spike Jonze (Adapation, Being John Malkovich) has a funny cameo, who disguise himself as a old-man in heavy make-up. Jonze is also one of the film's producers. Followed by a sequel. (*** 1/2 out of *****).</fullReview>

Im sure they put there fair share of money into making this movie. All the things they ride into the lake, the demo derby rental car, the trip to japan and the fireworks. It all costs a lot of money. So i guess what i'm trying to say is way to go boys, were waiting on number 4. Yeah, because everywhere there is someone going oh my god why are they doing that to themselves? and at the same time there are some late teens, early 20's aged people laughing so hard they cant stop.

		<fullReview>I think that Jackass is amazing, lets face it there cant be someone in this world that wouldn't smile on at least ONE stunt they do! Jackass basically represents the little kid in all of us, the stunts may be horrible sometimes, but a film that makes you cringe but at the same time, keeps you watching, is a good film in my eyes. No script, no plot, but 1 and a half hours of pure jackass that keeps fans laughing from start to the finish.Jackass may not be to everyones taste, we all have our differences. But if you think that Jackass the movie is disgusting and dangerous, why go and see it? Everyone knows what jackass is about, a bunch of guys doing dangerous and funny things to amuse others. So if you hated the movie, you must have hated the series..and if you hated the series...why go SEE the movie? People who think there "far above this sort of behaviour" are just too afraid to let anyone know that they find part of it funny.So if you have a really weak stomach, and think your above people who are just out to have a laugh then this film might not be for you, but if your up for letting a bunch of guys pull crazy pranks and entertain you for 90 mins, while at the same time having a VERY different experience than any other film you've seen before, watch it.And lets face it, even if you don't like a lot of the stunts, the girls can always go and look at a bunch of good looking guys with almost no clothes on half the time! :P</fullReview>

If it had a smell, it would smell like a rotten egg dipped in sewage heated to a slow boil over a fire. And Steve-O would probably eat it, or at least snort some up his nose. I hope not too many people were injured trying to repeat the mindless stunts performed in this film. That being said, this movie was so funny I laughed so hard as to burst that proverbial pustule and lighten up a bit. Since these idiots actually did all of this stupid stuff, then I don't have to or wonder what might happen if I did. There are more reckless and direct ways to toy with death, I'm sure, but I would be hard pressed to find any as entertaining as the ones these jackasses came up with for this movie.

Every time i watch it i just keep laughing. and now every time i see a bush of something that i can do something stupid with or to or onto or into, i will do something and it will be so good and its like the most fun in my life. and now I'm going to make a movie and call it "Phat Times" so get ready i learned it all from "Jackass" its a life saver nothing gets you psyched up more than hearing some sick as music and doing something stupid when listening to to some good as music so get use to the future of people being complete idiots because it's the funnest thing to do ever. mAcCa</fullReview>

		<fullReview>me and my friends hired it from the video shop and we could not stop laughing, we watch it once and we had to watch like 3 more times because we could not stop laughing. i loved it. my favourite 1 was when you were at the skate park thing with tony hawk and u were like stuff with pillows i liked that and the old people 1 um well they were all good but i thought a couple of them were a bit silly, and then me and my friends said that if we were someone we would be..... me Ryan Dunn, Nicole party boy, laura johnny Knoxville, Corinne Steve-o, Erin Bam Margera and then we were going to make our own version but then we thought might hurt ourselves to bad so we didn't but we had 1 thing to do a joke robbery run and say freeze thins is a robbery shot a cap gun and run out but none of us had the guts to do it we also had a little logo thing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Exactly what you would expect with the title "Jackass"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Apparently someone didn't know what "Jackass" was all about. This movie will only amuse people that have a sense of humor. If you've seen the TV show, its basically the same thing but amped up, A lot. I enjoyed it and many people did too. This film wasn't intended to be a classic like "Gone with the Wild" or "Forrest Gump". Its meant to be funny and that is what it does. Some other people that made comments will tell you not to waste the movie by renting or purchasing the DVD but by reading their comments, they seem to be in that category of people would can speak to dolphins when they fart.(They are tight asses.) So if you want to see the flick, by all means go and see it and then you can decide if it was funny for you or not.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If human civilization is to retain any semblance of forward momentum, never let our children see *Jackass: The Movie*. Matter of fact, once you've seen it yourself, burn your copy and wash your genitals.With a bravado that most of us relinquish at age twelve, Johnny Knoxville and his near-equals in brain-deficiency offer innumerable hideously-filmed vignettes of them being - well, jackasses: snorting wasabi and vomiting it, electrifying their perinea, harrying Chinatown dressed as "Night Pandas," golf-cart demolition derbying...From hurling themselves into spinning ceiling fans, to taking a dump in a hardware store display toilet, to presenting their meat-packed jockstraps for alligators to attack, with the number of laws that these guys transgress through their fatalistic stunts, it is unbelievable that none of them are crippled, dead or doing life as some perp's byotch.Though this "movie" has no socially-redeeming value, its makers obviously know something about our bloodthirsty proclivities that we who pretend to be civilized do not. Amidst all the assault, battery, indecent exposure, negligent driving, willful destruction of property and matchbox car butt-plugging, hidden in plain view amongst the skull-duggery and dumb-phuckery, there is most definitely a message - but I'm too busy laughing to figure out what it is.(Movie Maniacs, visit: www.poffysmoviemania.com)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Do we care if you try this at home or not?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>About a year after first seeing "Jackass The Movie," one of my good mates, my cousin, my brother and I got together to with my camcorder and tried some of these stunts. Only my brother was left uninjured. My friend scraped a heap of skin of his leg, my cousin nearly broke his wrist, and I damaged my kidneys. So MTV have a good reason to tell us not to do this at home! Some of the stunts we attempted were: Riding a four foot high pram down a hill, walking dizzy and blindfolded down a set of stairs, and riding a bike down a vertical drop of rocks. And it really, seriously, hurt.But of course, some of the things seen on "Jackass The Movie" are a thousand times worse.Having your nipple bitten by a baby alligator, making a snowcown and then urinating on it, dressing up as old person and pulling stunts in public, jumping into the blades of a spinning fan, and a heap of other crazy stuff.This is an excellent film which I strong recommend.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jackass: The Movie is a pointless exercise, and possibly the dumbest movie I have ever seen, yet it still has some very funny moments. I checked on the DVD and their are about 50 little things in all, and five of them are funny, but thoughs five are freaking hilarious. The story does not exist, period, end of story, or end of what is not a story. The acting is people not acting, but since I was supposed to give it a rating, it was'nt very good at all, and is simply people acting ever more stupid than usual, or so I hope, if not thats pretty freaking scary. The direction is maybe the only category that actually exists in this film, and it also sucks real bad. The visual effects are all real, or almost all real the end is probably not. Jackass is a film for stupid people without senses of humor.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>May contain spoilers ...I perhaps have the advantage of never having seen the TV show. I went to see this movie on a bit of a lark and laughed so hard in places that I had difficulty catching my breath. Yet, on the other hand,it contained absolutely nothing socially redeeming whatsoever.On the drive home, it hit me. It was like a movie-length live action cartoon, worthy of comparison to the classic Warner Bros short of the Forties and Fifties.Certainly, it is not for everyone. If you're the sort of person who gasped rather than laughed (albeit ruefully)at the racial humor in "Crash", look elsewhere.8/10, a bit overdone here and there, but otherwise for what it tries to be, one of the funniest films I've ever seen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jackass, the movie is a film which contains stunts- some to amuse, some to amaze, some to disgust and some... well some of the stunts are disturbing. I recommend you don't eat or drink while watching this film since the gruesome behaviors in this film would make you puke your food out of your nostrils.I'm not saying it's a bad movie i just don't recommend it to younger viewers or viewers which are very sensitive to gruesome content. I mean, this movie shows these people (possibly super humans) who give themselves pain in order for our laughter.For example, some guy in the film splashed a huge amount of wasabi (a hot Japanese flavoring for sushi, sashimi and other seafood delicacies by Japan) in his eyes, which made some people laugh, vomit or go 'Ohh...'. One of the most disturbing skits was the part where the guy urinated on the snow cone and ate it and ended up spewing a whole lot of puke everywhere.Well this review is coming to an end so in this second last paragraph i will tell you people that i enjoyed this movie. Even if i wasn't eating anything i still enjoyed it. Some scenes are funny, like the one where the guy wheres old people make up to make him look like an old person which looked excellently real.Overall this movie is one of the best (or only) POSSIBLY reality movies ever created. Oh believe me, but The Real Cancun was heavily scripted. I give this movie a 9 for filmography 8 for relevance 7 for acting 8 for sounds 7 for orientation and an overall score of 8.4/10. Good work directors...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film for the MTV generation!?!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie purist in me should really hate 'Jackass: The Movie', as it isn't really a movie and more like an extended series of rather lewd and crazy skits, but I found myself laughing more than once as well as being grossed out. Lets face it, you need to have some knowledge of the TV show to really be anywhere near interested in watching this film. I couldn't be bothered with the movie until I saw "Wild Boyz" featuring former Jackass members in Steve O and Chris "aka: Party Boy" Pontius- which then made me curious about the Jackass television series and then the film.'Jackass: The Movie' doesn't claim to be innovative, and the film works best if you semi-know these "jackasses" from the TV shows. The movie will probably only have significance with the current climate, and I doubt it could stand on its own. I think someone watching the film without any knowledge of its background and expect a plot will probably end up hating it. I didn't hate it, but I realise stupidity was its allure, and for the most part, I laughed and was equally shocked at some of the outlandish things that were done in the skits in the film. It's either incredibly brave or incredibly stupid, but regardless, the artistic merit is the sheer amount of crazy stunts you can perform without getting seriously injured or seriously sick. I know I wouldn't ever have me some of these things put to film for everyone to see, so for that, Johnny Knoxville and his crew are pretty brave! Though 10 years down the track they might be very embarrassed! My favourite skit was definitely the Butterbean one, and most of the skits were either obnoxious or filled with crazy stunts in golf buggies (Speaking of golf, I too was rooting for the golfers to beating the living **** outta them, lol)! Other skits were captivating due to the sheer disbelief that someone actually did that in front of a camera and allowed it to be filmed, and it's kind of perversely funny but ultimately pretty damn gross! But then again, movies with a plot rely on toilet humour too, expect certain Jackass members took it literally. 'Jackass: The Movie' is definitely one for the MTV generation--- however long that lasts! *** out of *****!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Jackass: The Movie' is a true reflection on the outcasts and freaks of our society. About how any wannabe will do anything to pee people off to get a laugh. To wreck cars and have your behind snapped at by crocodiles. Is that what we've come to? Well, if the answer is yes, then that's too bad for the normal members of our society- because it is so damn funny! If jumping into a ceiling fan off a mini trampoline isn't enough, how about trying out the famous 'bungie wedgie'? Or how about sniffing up the hottest peppers in the world? Still not convinced? Then see this.There is every insane thing you can think of, from taking a dump in a toilet on show to blowing air horns at busy golfers who then react and begin aiming at them.This is crude, risky and politically retrograde; not for everyone's cup of tea, but to me, this is an instant comedy classic.9 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love basically everything about this movie I only watched this last night on DVD, i've been wanting to watch it for sometime now, but i have to say that this movie is bloody hilarious some of the instant gags scenes they show for like a split second are stand outs. A lot of people talk about Jackass but i've never actually sat down to watch an episode of it, but definitely liked what I saw. Really the only thing in this movie I didn't like is the countless # of times they show everyones butt &amp; also which I didn't like at all &amp; thought that it was enough to make a straight person gay or bi was when Ryan Dunn puts a toy car in a condom &amp; uses some lubricant &amp; jams it in his rectum, I didn't like that scene one bit that really put me off, guaranteed that 1 - 10 people will throw up while watching this movie, it has everything from small paper cuts between fingers to someone drinking their own urine. If you are looking for a laugh you should see this immediately but make sure you keep the remote handy if it gets too much for you I personally loved it so my rating is 8.5 / 10, I would give it a perfect 10 but that rectum scene was over the top &amp; disturbing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If there is one thing you can say about this movie / documentary, than it must be that it isn't for the faint of stomach. I admit that several times I was almost rolling over the floor laughing, but from time to time, this movie just went way too far.Just to give you an example of what I really liked: the guys have put an alligator in the kitchen and when mom comes home, not expecting anything, she starts screaming and yelling. That was absolutely hilarious. But on the other hand you also get parts like peeing on a snow cone and eating it. That's just too much for me. I never had the urge to quickly find a toilet because I almost got sick, but I'm pretty sure that many people will.If you know the series that was shown on MTV, than you know exactly what to expect with this movie. It's exactly the same, but only a lot more. No, it isn't tasteful or intelligent, but it sure can be funny from time to time. And I have to say that I admire those guys' guts. Taking so much pain for 15 minutes of fame isn't something many people would do. I give this movie a 7/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jackass is a hilarious show. The things they do can be so stupid that sometimes, that you wonder what their normal lives must be like.The movie is so funny and it is even better than the show because there is no censorship. I wonder how it is that these guys can pull off such stunts without getting killed.This is the type of movie that doesn't have a story line or a plot. All you have to do is kick back and watch the stars of the show do some incredibly stupid things.Just about every stunt was funny, except for the one with the cougar, that was plain stupid. One of the funniest and most shocking things in the entire movie is the last stunt, which I won't spoil for you. All I can say is that the looks on everyone's faces and the reactions were priceless.Even though this isn't my favorite movie, I still had a great time when I watched this. I was in a gloomy mood because one of the best summer vacations I ever had was coming to an end. Thanks to this movie, I got out of that gloomy mood and was in better spirits once again.This isn't a date movie, unless your date likes this kind of thing. The best time to watch this is when you're tired and everything seems hilarious, or when you're stressed out and need something to cheer you up. It works very well at cheering you up.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This type of comedy is what I have missed since Monty Python or the Norwegian Christmas Calender "Br?drene Dahl". Totally without limits and fearless. The MTV series might be even better like the Monty Pythons Flying Circus might be better than "their" movies. Anyway, Jackass definitely gives a good impression about what they are about. I think some of them are even more talented than others. Steve-O for example seems to have almost supernatural abilities. Anyway, they show an absolute fearless attitude towards the surroundings which teach you a lot about human psychology and how to make it in modernity. I feel very much in the same situation as the Jack Ass Gang. But maybe that is because I am on about the same mental level(?)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was hilarious! The five favorite stunts are The Shoplifter, The Gong, Wee Man kicking himself in the forehead, Knoxville jumping into the ceiling fan, and the Golf Course Airhorn. Some of the stunts are gross, though, like the Wasabi Snooters, which is pretty sick to do. Another is the Yellow Snow Cone, who would drink their own urine? The movie has no plot at all, but it is another great film to view when you want to get a good laugh. I would also recommend watching any of the spin-offs like Viva La Bam, CKY, and Wildboyz. I would recommend everyone to see this movie and they will be grossed out and you will be laughing all throughout. I give this film a ten out of ten for its comedy content.</fullReview>

Otherwise, I would have felt that it was a complete waste of money. I came across this modern day gem on the movie network, here in Toronto, Canada. I must admit, there were some funny parts in this movie, like the scene where the guys are using an airhorn on the golf course, and sound it off when golfers are taking a swing at the ball, and a couple of other scenes. Even though I don't want to admit it, parts of this movie were funny. It's not a movie that I would buy, even on tape. The humour and stunts reminded me of stuff that Tom Green used to do on his show. It's one of those, see it once and forget it classics.

		<fullReview>This really is a wonderful film about friendship, loyalty and blind ambition.It celebrates diversity of spirit and explores the male psyche better than most "fiction".Close to a dozen testosterone-charged lads, led by the indefatigable Johnny Knoxville, subject themselves to a roster of human endurance challenges (defecating in public, pole vaulting into a sewer, getting shot) for our entertainment and earn truckloads of respect for having big balls and positive attitudes.You really do have to love and admire these fellows. They're making the most of their youth. They're not sitting around turning into fatties, although one bloke needs to cut down on the chunky chews. They're taking life by the horns, ripping the horns off and defecating down the holes where the horns used to be.The wraparound "film" sequences are a total hoot and the film's "wrap party", where Knoxville and his cronies party to Andrew W's revelatory "We Want Fun" brought legitimate tears of joy to my eyes.Priceless.

		<fullReview>JACKASS: THE MOVIE was one of 2002's most special movies sort of...cause the MTV show was such an enormous success that when the movie came in the cinemas everyone wanted to see it! Well, many, wanted to see it. Johnny Knoxville, the popular host from the series got back with even more crude, dangerous and crazy stunts than the series, filled with laughs and insanity. Together with Ryan Dunn, Bam Margera, Chris Pontius, Steve-O and many other Jackasses they do different kind of stuff, like testing a muscle stimulator on different parts of the body, testing rocket skates, bothering golfers with air horns, swimming with whale sharks, cutting theirselves up between the webbings of the fingers, toes and mouth with a paper-cut, ruining a golf course with golf cars, getting serious ass kicked by pro. boxers, getting your nipple bitten by a baby alligator etc. Well, it sounds crazy, and it is! and funny as psycho! Hilarious man!!"Kick yourself in the head Wee Man" Johnny Knoxville has become a cult legend sort of, and without doubt the hottest name in MTV business, cause these guys really knows how to entertain, fascinate, sadly enough inspire and get you to grab a pillow. Even if they pee in snow and eat it, even if they put a toy car up their butt, its something with JACKASS that was, is and remains magical, as Knoxville himself pronounced it: "Let's step into the magic..." and it surely is something magical about it!The opening scene is some of the greatest ever been! Classical hymn rolling and we see fog, and suddenly we see a shopping cart coming and in it stands off course; Jackass crew. Knoxville spanking the cart as a horse, Dave England hanging on the side..here they come! Those who doesn't know the people, and just for the class, we get the people introduced with a stop in time (Johnny Knoxville, Bam Margera, Ryan Dunn...). And they go, serious fast in slow-motion and punches each other while we see giraffes and other animals getting lead away from the highway they're coming down, three guys falls off with bricks flying threw dust and air, and Knoxville covered in dust rises from his bended position and shouts his indispensable line: "Hi I'm Johnny Knoxville welcome to Jackass!!" They continue rolling, crashes and flies into a lots of groceries, the famous theme guitar riff and JACKASS: THE MOVIE appears on a totally black screen...this looks very promising!"This isn't gonna work!" "It might..." CkY stars (as in Jackass) stars off course too, Bam Margera, Ryan Dunn, Brandon DiCamillo (sadly little in the movie!), Rake Yohn and Chris Raab (Raab himself). Especially the Bungee Wedgie stunt is worth a look, showing Raab dropping of a tree dangling from a panties while Knoxville and others sits laughing hysterically. Jackass: The Movie's got extremely crude stunts, lots of nudity, brutal language and again...not nice actions, well, in other words; like the series although that one was cencored, the movie is nothing for kids really! STARS: **** 4/5 (not as good as the series anyway!)</fullReview>

Except for one part (Guess which bit). I can stand the vomiting, boxing, general violence and disconcerting masochism, but the one bit I have watched between fingers 3 out of the 4 times I have seen it is the paper cuts.

		<fullReview>STAR RATING:*****Unmissable****Very Good***Okay**You Could Go Out For A Meal Instead*Avoid At All CostsI promise I won't do this very often,but I'm going to do two seperate,angle focusing reviews on this film.In hindsight,I don't consider it to be one of the worst films of the year.Well,yes,I still do in one sense,but in another,more understanding sense,I can see more of an upside to it.In fact,I can see a downright brilliant side to it.In my other review,I complained that all the gags were tasteless and tended to come at the expense of others.Well,thinking about it,I guess it is only a film and they were all probably staged anyway.And,viewed from that angle,they are as hilariously funny as anything you might watch on another crude MTV show of this nature,i.e. Beavis and Butthead.Yeah,the movie's lack of anything resembling a plot is a problem,but otherwise,if you want a fu*king funny movie,this is one you might well want to consider after all.****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Jackasses" or "Latent Homosexuals"?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***SPOILERS***The ridiculous and unfunny "stunts" in this film seem to really be excuses for the cast to express their latent homosexuality.A group of men in various stages of undress sitting around a motel room watching another man lying on a bed and applying copious amounts of lubricant to his anus in preparation to insert a toy car is one example. Inserting fireworks into another man's anus and tying them to another man's penis is another. Also, during the end credits, a nude man is shown hand in hand with a man in a giant penis costume, jumping up and down on a trampoline. These guys are uber-gay.The fact that two of the "actors" (Steve-O and Party Boy) wear g-strings as costumes, and that everyone is at least semi-nude from time to time, confirms the homoerotic undertones of this film. Being from Northern California, I have nothing against homosexuals, but these guys should just go ahead and start making ultra-kinky gay porn, so they can stop killing/kidding themselves with "male-bonding" stunts.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The funniest movie ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I not going to go into depth here because Jackass doesn't require thought. It simply shows you how hilarious life can get when you give a bunch of guys who aren't afraid to hurt themselves or do gross things a camera. The cast of Jackass are a bunch of guys that I'd love to hang around with if they didn't pull so many jokes on each other. I went to see this in the theaters and my eyes hurt from all the crying I was doing because I was laughing so hard. My girlfriend was laughing so long she got sick. If somebody doesn't appreciate this movie they're probably too uptight to appreciate life. Bottom Line: Jackass rules, it's a shame that MTV didn't have the guts to keep it on the air.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If your a fan of Jackass the TV series on MTV then this will be fairly recognisable stuff to you.The only differance is that the stunts are a little bit more drastic and that the camera work is a lot better because of the big screen equipment. It is very hard to give a review without giving away what happens in the film so.... ** Spoiler Alert** If you are squeamish in any way then i sugest that Jacksass The Movie is not for you and here is why. We see such stunts as Electrodes on the genetals , Baby Aligator biting the nipple , A Toy car inserted in the rectum and worst of all for me the guys sat there and gave themselves paper cuts!!!This might not sound like entertainment to some people but you couldn't be more wrong. This is engrossing and fun to watch and i would recommend that if your with a group of friends that have just got back from the pub, stick Jackass the Movie in the DVD player and laugh your socks off! 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What's to say - if you like Jackass the TV show you'll love Jackass the movie (10 out of 10). If you hate Jackass the TV show, you'll hate Jackass the movie (0 out of 10) The movie achieves everything it sets out to do - basically an elongated TV show with all the stuff that MTV wouldnt let em do on the box. There won't be anything too surprising to fans (or viewers who've seen Steve'o's DVDs or any of Bam Margera's CKY videos) but it's incredibly entertaining and the golf course/air horn sequence is pure cinematic punk rock. Fans who havent should make sure they check out the DVD for the deleted scenes and the commentary.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Definitely not a film for kids! These guys do some just plain stupid things, and putting those images into kids' minds may get some undesirable results. Guess that's up to the parents anyways...This movie has its funny parts. I was never a big fan of the Jackass TV show but some of the stunts in the film did make me laugh. The alligator in the house was a funny one and I got a kick out of the meter fairy. The part where they were dressed-up like old men and people are trying to help them was so hilarious I hurt myself laughing.Jackass: The Movie also has some very, very uncomfortable scenes. I can't help but feel sorry for Steve-O at times, but I figure if he is stupid enough to do this stuff he deserves it. Also the stunts are sometimes homosexual or masochistic in nature which makes it almost hard to watch. I couldn't watch when they were giving each other paper cuts. That is just plain sick and goes over the line into a baffled "why?"... But there are enough funny parts to make the embarrassing stunts worth cringing through.Overall I would say that this movie is worth watching if you have nothing else to do. It is funny to see them messing with the public like that, as long as you can take some really nasty parts too.Oh yeah and they actually make their camera crew vomit a few times in this movie...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Going into this movie having not seen the TV show I wasn't exactly sure what to expect. What I got was 85min of uncontrollable laughter and enjoyment, sure it isn't exactly a work of movie art but it was never intended on being so. The stunts that they perform are sometimes unbelievably stupid but thats what makes it so damn funny and who hasn't had a little chuckle at one time or another at someone's expense when they have hurt themselves by some stupid way. All in all this movie is about entertaining those who enjoy this kind of humour and for myself and all the mates of mine who have seen it, Jackass ceretainly fulfilled that role.ITS ALL ABOUT ENTERTAINMENT !!!!!!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>now, there's no plot with the movie. no goals to be accomplished except to make you laugh. And it succeeds! For those who didn't find it as funny as much as the rest of the human race, stick to your one note jokes instead. Jhonny Knoxville and his crazy gang of pyschos perform a variety of dangerous and sometimes extremely crude stunts, all for a laugh. Naturally this is the type of movie that the teen audience should watch, as a lot of the stunts are not appropriate for people say, under 10 years old or people over 70 years old. But if this kind of humor is your cup of tea, then drink up! you'll have a riot. 8.7/10Rated R: extremely crude and very dangerous stunts; nudity; language</fullReview>

Jackass: The Movie is gross, funny, disturbing, and down right awesome, Johnny Knoxville and his cast of misfits do not disappoint here. Jackass: The Movie is for those who love to watch stunts and stuff you always wanted to see people try (mess up a rental car, crash golf carts, fight a pro boxer, eat gross stuff, etc., etc.) Jackass: The Movie isn't for everyone so don't watch this if you can't handle the gross mayhem.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From the beginning, complete with "Carmina Burana" soundtrack to the [spoiler] failed ending [/spoiler], I simply could not stop laughing. Not that I tried too hard.Funniest thing is, I was with my girlfriend, who hates stupid movies to a stunning degree. After we finished watching it, we both said "this was insanely great".Sure, there are a couple of jokes that really don't make sense, and one or two situations where you end up thinking "that was gross, but unfunny". The rest of the time, though, the movie flows like an immense one-liner joke. From dancing Pandas (to the song of "Turning Japanese") to street strippers, this movie is a hell of a show. Incredibly funny.I'd think that with different actors, this movie would have been a total mess. It's the actors' attitude and charisma the things that makes this all work out. They are just like your friends at college.After my friends and I watched it, we realised what we had just seen was Beavis and Butt-Head all grown up. The Jackass crew is incredibly similar to them - their attitude, their contagious laughter, their disregard for themselves, everything. Funny as hell.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>**POSSIBLE SPOILERS**I had my doubts about wanting to see this movie. True, the idea of sitting through 87 minutes of "Jackass: The Movie" wasn't really enough for me to pay money to go see it in the theaters. Rumor also had it that there were some nasty images of self-abuse that would probably disturb the average viewer. So when a friend of mine suggested that I borrow this DVD, i was a little trepidatious; yet, at the same time, I was also morbidly curious to see how this "film" turned out. Needless to say, during the film, I found myself laughing like i never have before. It's crude, crass, and damn near unwatchable at times--I still have not seen the "Paper Cuts" sequence after watching the film three times (once with production audio, and two other times with the various commentaries included on the DVD). But i thought it was damned funny.People act stupid sometimes--well, most times, as is readily apparent in these proceedings. And every now and again, you get those couple of nuggets of sidesplitting goofiness that just make you laugh from balls to bones. The ending of the "Roller Disco" sequence comes to mind--as the van comes to a screeching halt, one person on roller skates is propelled speedily into the wall, and immediately bounces off of it onto his ass. This cartoonish image is making me laugh uncontrollably as I write this. That's all that Johnny Knoxville and Company are really doing--they're making themselves into live-action versions of cartoons they may have grown up watching. There are exceptions to this (most notably anything having to do with bodily functions), but that's the base of it. Cartoon humor abounds in this flick--it really does feel like watching an 87 minute, vulgar-as-hell, adult version of a Road Runner &amp; Wile E. Coyote short. Take, for instance: the many sequences that showcase cars or golfcarts getting beat to crap; the fireworks pranks on Bam's parents; Knoxville's experimental "Rocket Skates"; walking highwire above a pit of alligators; Steve-O polevaulting all manner of obstacles; the opening stunt that causes the gang to fly into a roadside sales stand; the deleted scene which shows the "failed ending", which was basically an attempt at making a human Rube Goldberg device; and most notably, the scene all the way at the end of the credits called "Son Of Jackass"--a spoof of "Jackass"'s opening credit sequence, with the main characters in old-age makeup and walking with canes, trying to dodge everything from explosions to falling houses. NONE of these sequences would be out of place in a Bugs Bunny cartoon.You can't wait to see what happens next, if you care to watch. Then again, it might just be that thing that we humans have where there's an accident on the side of the road and you just have to slow down to have a look at the bodies and the damage.I'm actually going to buy this DVD soon. I think the movie, some sequences aside, is thoroughly entertaining.8/10--docked points for the scenes that i have to chapter skip through.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I loved the TV series after my kids made me watch it. I wasn't sure how it would transform to a cinema audience. The cinema I was in was made up of male and female and young and old and everyone laughed. Not always in the same places but hey one man's meat etc.The gang are accused by some of staging / setting up the stunts. Well sure that happens but the outcomes are unpredictably dangerous and that's what makes us sit enthralled and laugh when the pain is inflicted and believe me some of the scenes in the film are not for the squeamish. As a golfer I was aghast at the golf cart sketch but without letting my other club members know I laughed until my sides ached. Watch it and I dare you not to laugh at some point.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprise/No surprise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Surprise--I actually watched this collection of freak show stunts. It's no surprise that it'd be months after it was released. It's a surprise that I sat through the whole thing, and it's no surprise that I didn't pay to see it (also no surprise that I'd never watch it again.)I dunno why, but the humor in Jackass just fails to very much for me. Okay, it's home shot set of "profession idiots" doing stupid stunts, which are not that outrageous and are destined to fail, resulting in something painful like falling on their face, crap in their pants, etc. Either that or it builds on putting others in an uncomfortable/awkward position to get some kind of reaction like the xray of a rectum-planted toy car, old geezer shoplifter, destruction derby with a rental car.The funniest stunts were the truly spontaneous ones--"Hey, kick yourself in the head." Or jumping into a fan. Quick, to the point, funny. The rest of the "thought out" pranks come across as a retarded children making a desperate attempt at being cool (see also any high school campus, where I suspect this film is a hit.)Then again, I don't find the shocked, dropped jawed, disbelief most of the planned stunts get from its oblivious targets very entertaining. Heck, any remotely intelligent person can get that look from anyone by asking an unexpected question, saving themselves the trouble of looking like an idiot, er sorry, looking like a Jackass.I'd much prefer seeing these mild and tame pranks go horribly wrong, resulting in real pain for the idiot stupid enough to implement it and not all those safety nets to protect them from any stunt that has any remote danger factor to it. If they're so daring, why not walk a tightrope over alligators without the expert standing ready to save his ass?Oh that's right, like the high school campus they cater to, Jackass isn't about the possibility of real hurt and pain, it's about the illusion of that world while living in its protected little microcosm. Jackass would impress me if these nuts would actually push real boundries, but again, it's not about that. It's about doing something stupid that only looks daring. The papercut sketch is a good metaphorical representation to what Jackass really is. Just a little nick that stings, but when everything's said and done, you have a 1/4 of an inch break in your skin. I'm not impressed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One day last November, I was really really bored. It must have been a weekend or something. Or maybe it was Thanksgiving. I'm not sure. Anyway, for some reason, I felt like watching a bunch of home movies of people getting hurt in horrible ways. There was yet another Trading Spaces marathon on TLC, so I decided to go watch Jackass at the huge movieplex on the south side of town. To make a long story short, I went in expecting to see a bunch of retards hurt themselves and spew bodily waste all over in public; and that's exactly what I got. I didn't expect to see a coherent plotline or a resolved issue. I just went to see some nuts get busted. And in that, I think Jackass delivers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jackass Johnny Knoxville and his crew run around performing "stunts" so they can get a movie put into theaters.This film is quite original if people actually thought about it, but then again, some of the stunts performed here are just not funny. There were several stunts where me and my friends laughed hard, but then there were segments which were obviously staged and were just not funny. Just because they had a few beers and then decided to do something dumb, doesn't mean that it was funny and doesn't mean it should have been included in the film.The film actually has a surprisingly short running time, somewhere around 87 minutes or something. Some of their ideas were very creative (like the car up the ass, that was brilliance) but then some of the stunts ranged from the unfunny (the rocket boots or whatever) to the psychotic (the golf cart rally thingy...that was cool).Luckily, none of these jackasses died or got seriously injured during the making of this film. Well, not too seriously. Johnny Knoxville is looking a little nervous when he is about to be shot in a gut-pad by a really strong-ass gun. Steve-O also gets a little nervous about sticking the little toy car up his rectum.Me and my friends had to stop this movie for about twenty minutes and go into the basement because the town tornado sirens started going off and it was raining like hell out. After about ten minutes, one of my friends decided to go upstairs and finish JACKASS: THE MOVIE without me and my other friends. So, the tornado sirens are going off, we're all hiding in the basement and my other jackass friend is upstairs finishing the movie without us. So, we went up and finished it. The alarms went off a few minutes later, so we were safe, but I missed about five minutes of JACKASS: THE MOVIE. My friend told us we didn't miss much. The movie wholly original, but stays clean with other "reality" shows that most people claim "are filled with sin". Yeah, right. I recommend you see THE REAL CANCUN. Again, these are certainly not the greatest movies ever made (hell, they don't even come close) but at least they are entertaining.JACKASS: THE MOVIE gets 3/5.-Don't try this at home.</fullReview>

Some of it is very hard to watch, such as the yellow sno-cone or the paper cuts, but all the same it is painfully funny.

If you like comedy in general like I do, you WILL love this movie! This is basically the show pumped with steroids, adrenaline, and a few strong hallucinagenics. You just better have a stomach for gross-out humor as well. Some of these stunts are so gross and outrageous that when I first watched it on DVD, I nearly threw up the stunts where so outrageously funny and outlandish. If you do buy the DVD, make sure to watch the additional footage that wasn't shown in theatres. it's worth the buy. After you watch this movie, you WILL take their warning "not to try this at home" seriously. A definite must-watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Definitely an acquired taste, Jackass is something that you either hate or love. I'm one of those people that think it's funny (usually), and believe that it's definitely one of the more "creative" things around.Having said that, I'd like to reiterate what MTV and even Johnny himself has said on numerous occasions: don't try this at home, kids. Chances are, if you tried, you'd end up dead. But I guess these guys (I won't call them "professionals," since they're really not) are just lucky to still be living.Jackass is exactly what I thought it would be--therefore it has to get a score above "1"; since it was average and didn't go out of its way to impress me with more, it's getting a "5." But don't be fooled, this isn't cinema as you might normally apply the term. It's documentary, insanity, and humor mixed with stuntman and self-destructive instincts.But it's also funny. So, want to laugh at idiots who darn near kill themselves? Watch Jackass. Want brilliant and topical humor that's "higher class"? Go someplace else--this is definitely not it.How these guys got a show amazes me. I wouldn't have bankrolled this, but some people are just lucky, I guess.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Call it Truth in Advertising. Nobody who sees this movie can claim they weren't forewarned as to the content. This is humor reduced to its most crude and basic level as a gang of complete jackasses resort to a series of stunts, gags, and practical jokes that accept no bounds when it comes to bad taste in pursuit of a laugh. A typical scene is one where two of the Jackasses find new ways to play with bottle rockets. One, wearing only a thong, inserts the stick end into his rear (this distinction being worth pointing out inasmuch as, with this crew, it's entirely conceivable for them to insert it to fire in the opposite direction) and lights the fuse while the other stands waiting nearby, the rocket tied to his, uh, member with some dental floss. Needless to say, you won't see stuff like this on PBS, and if your tastes in humor run more toward Woody Allen or Garrison Keillor, you might want to give this movie a pass.As for the rest of us, it's really a question of how high your threshold for watching humiliating, disgusting, or painful behavior happens to be. My own reaction was mixed. Some of it was too much, most notably the Yellow Snow Cone and the Hardware Store Toilet scenes, the latter was so gross that the cameraman started barfing (all dutifully recorded on film, of course). Others, like the Riot Gun Ammo and Paper Cut scenes, seemed to `celebrate' the ability to withstand pain as opposed to actually being funny. Some struck me as just dumb, including most of the Japan footage. Still, there was plenty of good stuff, my favorites being the Golf Course Air Horn, the Alligator in the House, and Tropical Pole Vaulting. Some stuff, like Waking up Dad at 1 AM with a barrel of exploding firecrackers, then doing a repeat a few hours later in his van as he's about to leave for work, succeeds by virtue, not of cleverness but sheer, mindless audacity and others, like a five second shot concerning a Jackass, a mini-trampoline and a ceiling fan, work because they're completely unexpected. It must also be noted that the DVD offers up real value, both in the form of deleted scenes, many of which are better than the ones that were left in, and in the two accompanying commentary tracks featuring the filmmakers and the Jackasses themselves. The bottom line is this movie is all about reveling in pure mayhem and wretched excess, so don't look for any Oscar worthy acting or direction, since the only awards these guys are likely to qualify for are the Darwin Awards.RatingJudged by `normal' movie standards: 6/10Judged purely on its own terms 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Writing a review for a movie like "Jackass: The Movie" is a pretty cut and dry routine. I really don't need to go into detail too much because if you wandered onto this page, you already know what this "movie" is about. It's short, about 80 minutes total, but it is absolutely HILARIOUS. All of the pain and shame that goes into this is genuine. My favorite bits being the Muscle Stimulator and Off-Road Tattoo with Henry Rollins. Although not as extreme as the CKY videos (a must-see), "Jackass: The Movie" goes way beyond the limits MTV set for the show. Fans will not be disappointed, everyone else with either vomit or stop watching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jackass is a tough movie to review. A compilation of various skits ranging from a few seconds to no more than 10 minutes each, the skits are put together in no particular order to the tune of 84 minutes of pure mayhem. For those of you who are not familiar with the Jackass phenomena, it originally aired as a series on the MTV cable network and feature such non familiar names as Johnny Knoxville, Steve-O, Bam Margera and Ryan Dunn. This group of renegades seem to enjoy having themselves tortured, tormented and put through such tests of idiocy and pain that audiences can't help but gape in awe at their audacity. Jackass makes no excuses for its entertainment value. And that is the fun.Whether you consider such skits as a man in a mouse mask rolling over a floor of mousetraps, Johnny Knoxville having his nipple bitten by a baby alligator, or a man eating yellow snow as fun or a sign of the forthcoming apocalypse, you can't take your eyes off the screen and each skit is just short enough to keep your attention for the full 84 minutes length of the feature. Ultimately, it is a young man's movie. It is the type of DVD that college and teenage boys will play whenever there are guests over and they want to invoke a reaction. And react, you will. Along the way, we see Johnny Knoxville get paper cuts in the webbing of his feet, Steve-O snorting wasabi and a man who puts a toy car up his butt and then goes to the hospital for X-rays. Disgusting. Yes. Horrifying. Yes. Degrading. Yes. But funny as hell.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>okay, so it's not really a movie. But what it is, is an ingenious piece of comedy in cinema. It's better to see this film around people, preferably a packed out screen at your local cinema. Everyone laughs, some more than most, people groan, cringe, oohh and ahhh. It's a great audience participation film. If you like the show, you'll love this. If you don't, then you won't like this, Simple as that. It's 90 minutes worth of men who dare to test their own pain levels. Baby crocodiles biting nipples, a guy getting the crap kicked out of him by a girl. It's fun, and it is funny. Yeah, some of the little sketches are pretty pointless, but only very few of them. Most get their fair amount of sinful giggles, and stomach churning moans. Let's hope the boys can come back for another film next year. It would be much needed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why criticize what's meant to be stupidity? ((spoilers?))</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>- 10/10 if you're a Jackass fan...anything below 3 if you aren't. -Many people say that "Jackass, the Movie" needed so much more than what it offered. I ask everyone who said this, "What the bloody heck for?"The movie, based off the MTV run program, is dedicated entirely to senseless violence and stupidity lacking direction or a definite plot. The point to both the show and the movie is to display just what people can do without fear of bodily harm or shame. True, it is mindless and not exactly PBS material; but it's much like what Aristotle theroized about Tragic plays: displays of negative or disruptive actions can outlet our own inclinations to do these things ourselves. Not that you'd go out and try to launch fireworks from your rectum; just that it shows you what would happen if it was tried.The movie appeals to our more unreasonable sides and lets us experience those actions harmlessly. An additional plus is that it can make you laugh harder than you have in a while. If you payed to see this movie, you must have known what you were getting in to. The previews did not mislead and the movie is named the same as the TV show. If you feel that you were subjected to stupidity...well, you were. But that's what was intended. If you thought the movie was too mindless, don't blame the movie for delivering what it was supposed to; blame yourself for thinking it would be something else.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't get why people criticise Jackass The Movie for having "No Plot" - I strongly believe that the movie would be very bad if they had tried to put some structure upon those scenes. they are meant to stay alone and so what?But now to the philosophical part: The funny thing about Jackass is that almost everybody, even its defenders think that it's stupid. In contrary, most of the Jackass stunts (not the Steve O ones. they are just dangerous...) have a deeper quality - just think about why they are funny (at least to most people watching the movie). They are funny 'cause they put usual habits, sports etc. in a new context - now they seem to be completely absurd. And in essence this adds a whole new meaning to otherwise "normal things". It questions the modern life and asks what happens to things when you put them into another area, another context. The absurdity of modern life is in the core of most of the Jackass stunts. There are so many things which should you make wonder in "real life" what is going on with our Today, but you accept it cause you are used to. Jackass can change your view of things - lets be grateful for that, folks!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ok, so it's not exactly the next Lord of the Rings, but it succeeds where many movies fail.Far to often these days I find myself actually getting bored in the cinema, sitting through a couple of hours of Hollywood rubbish which looks like every other film out there! I have to say, LOTR didn't hold my full attention for three hours...So Jackass, that MTV show that's shown on about 4 different networks in the UK, that one we're all getting slightly tired of... Before seeing the movie I was a bit worried. I love the show, but I couldn't imagine it going anywhere it hasn't before on TV. And I was probably right, it was more of the same (in fact it wasn't even as gross as the TV show, just think of "The Omlette") but my god was it funny!This is where it succeeds. Never before in my lifetime (I haven't been around long mind, I'll give you that) have I ever experienced the whole audience in the cinema laughing non-stop throughout a whole movie! Even while watching true comedy classics in the cinema you normally hear the odd giggle (and that one guy at the back with the really loud laugh) but this was just an amazing experience! We all laughed when they played pranks on the public, we all whinced when they inflicted pain on themselves, we all covered our eyes when they threw up... It really was a shared experience!This is what films should be about, new cinematic experiences that actually make the audience react for a change.Therefore I rate Jackass: The Movie very highly indeed. It's certainly not for everyone, but most people will laugh at it, and that really is all that matters (And don't give me that "Is this what comedy has come to?" rubbish, it's mearly just another way of doing it).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow, and ouch.If you liked Jackass on MTV, you need to see this movie.If you don't like watching people inflict pain on themselves and others, rude, crude behavior, irresponsible actions, and prefer to watch family entertainment that is likely to be found on The Christian Channel or Disney Channel, stay well clear of this one folks.Kissing the MTV censors goodbye, Johnny Knoxville and the rest of the broken-bone brigade let it all hang out (literally), allowing fans to see their stunts the way they should be seen - unedited and full of blood, naughty words, bile and body parts.You'll laugh, you'll cry, your cringe, then `cak' yourself silly, as `Team Jackass' perform a series of practical jokes and indulge in mad-cap behavior, which will have you riveted to your seat, and watching out for untoward behavior of others, while breaking out into fits of laughter along with the cinema audience.Ok, how funny is it? Somewhere in the ninety minute run, Johnny Knoxville or one of his protgs (Jason `Wee Man' Acuna, Brandon DiCamillo, Steve-O, Ryan Dunn or Dave Dunn) come up with something that will strike your funny bone, rather than your knee-cap, whether it be the bottle rocket in the bunghole, or the testicle seeking bowling ball, or the electro-shock pads to the `nuts' (do you see a recurring pattern here)? You will be soiling your pants with excitement. Just you wait.The cast of Jackass: The Movie, are quite simply modern day heroes for the common man (or maniac teenager). They didn't ask for this role in life; it's just who they are, and what they do on a day-to-day basis, with or without a camera around. One of these `sickos' must have had just enough brain-cells left to come up with a way to make a million bucks out of their unusual, dangerous and fun-filled lifestyle.This has got to be the funniest (and grossest) film of 2002, whether uptight cinema snobs, and `respected film critics' admit it or not.The majority of Jackass is a one failed suicide attempt after another, with the occasional practical joke thrown in. It's like the `Darwin Awards' runners-up, on film. `Make 'em laugh' (at any cost) is the Jackass motto.Jackass is rated R for a reason. The language is not appropriate for kiddies, and I wouldn't let my daughter see it until at least sixteen.See the film now. That means you, jackass!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film had me in stitches before the opening credits had even begun. And it just got better and better. If you're a Jackass fan then this is the crazed crew at their best. It seems that this film has left Johnny Knoxville and the crew with a no-holds-barred license and they're maxing it out. They leave nothing out, giving you stunts, crass, cringe and just plain sickening clips that leave you wanting to have a break to catch your breath before the next clip comes on.Before going to see the movie, I was under the impression that Johnny and the boys would be acting out a story with their crazy antics making up some of the stunts and plots. But nothing is further from the truth. There is no storyline, just clip after clip of mayhem, exactly like their MTV show, but bigger scale.If you've never seen Jackass it's probably best to aquaint yourself with the series by viewing some of the episodes from MTV before embarking on the movie. You never know though, you might just find it amusing.If you're like me and love Jackass to bits, even if you do sometimes wonder why anyone would want to do anything like they do, then this is for you. It leaves you wanting more and laughing the whole way home.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes, I know. Movies have directors, actors, scripts and usually some sort of storyline but this is Jackass so who cares. Basically Jackass: The movie is an extended version of the popular TV series though slightly more extreme. Those of you who haven't heard of the show, Where have you been? The basic concept of Jackass is that Johnny Knoxville and his band of merry hell-makers film themselves doing the stupidest stunts imaginable, pulling the most outrageous pranks and causing themselves unbelievable pain. Hardly the most ingenious concept but you've got to hand it to them, their form of extreme slapstick is absolutely hilarious as well as totally cringe-worthy.It is so hard to review this film on technical merit because it doesn't strictly follow the definition of a movie however it does demonstrate what movies are about. The level of reaction to every stunt was clearly audible throughout the cinema and nobody left without an enormous grin, for me this just shows why people got to the cinema; to be entertained. This is what movies are all about.The opening scene and the end scene are well worth mentioning as they were absolutely perfect in matching the mood of the film.Jackass never takes itself too seriously and creates a great atmosphere within the audience. I was left giggling for about an hour after the film had finished and I had no idea why. Jackass fans make it your mission in life to see this film. Anyone else should go just to see wee-man kick himself in the head, although I strongly advise against taking food into this one.The extreme escapades of the Jackass crew deserve an extreme (and I don't give these often) 10/10</fullReview>

But that's the attraction of this movie. It plays out in real life all the things that you would never do yourself.Who hasn't secretly been tempted to make a loud noise just as a golfer is about to swing?

		<fullReview>Wow.My face was sore from laughing so hard ten minutes into the film.Jackass, for those of you who have been living in a place where MTV and Channel 4 are things of sacreligious heresy, or you just don't watch it, is a TV-series-turned-feature-length-episode of things that probably only the "MTV generation" will laugh at. It's a group of friends doing stupid things that only heavily drunk or stoned people would even think of doing, only they're neither drunk nor stoned. It's pure, unadulterated, senseless fun. The guys risk life and limb doing crazy stunts for a laugh.During one scene, three of the friends decide to take air-horns to a golf course and put people off their shots as they swung for the ball. Another scene involved another three of the friends undergoing some heavy make-up and are made to look like pensioners, and proceed to chase each other round the streets on their motorised "old-people-buggies". One even races down the street, looking as though he's pushing 20mph, screaming out that his brakes have failed. When someone chased him and stops his buggy, he finally thanks the young man and asks him to push him to the top so that he can do it again, because it was fun.Jackass is the only film that I've ever seen where I've actually laughed all the way through about 95% of the film, right through to the end of the credits sequence. The remaining 5% was spent looking away from the scene in one extremely painful and wince-inducing scene that I won't mention, I'll just leave it for you to see for yourselves, and you'll know exactly which scene I meant....It's definitely the most original movie ever made, with no script, no plot, and all the laughs. 10/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's just so brilliant. It will win no awards, but that doesnt decrease the entertainment value. It's great becuase it can be watched over and over, and still send you into states of maniacal laughter. Maybe I like it becuase it was just the kind of things my friends and I would do in college. The reactions by Knoxville, Steve-O and the gang make you laugh as well, making it seem as if you were right there with them. There is nudity, but the censored shots posted on the internet make it seem worse than it really is. Although there are a handful of penis related material, no actual genitalia is seen. It's simply a laugh-a-second movie. Your kids will want to see it, and you might want to see it with them.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have never laughed so hard and have never heard an audience laugh so hard than it did at Jackass. The film pure and simply does its job. The funniest stuff involved the fireworks and anything with animals attacking was funny too. The filmmakers were smart because they only included four scenes that were completely disgusting and they spread them out pretty far apart and gave fair warning before grossing you out. But getting a little disgusted is a small price to pay for all the laughs you get.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What is jackass about? Well, it's about pain, and courage, and stupidity for the best part. Unfortunately, it's also about humiliation and scatalogical jokes.There is no story: the movie starts with jonny trashing a rented car (and refusing to play for it), and ends with a stunt in a lake. Sequences after sequences, the spectator discovers an over excited band of post-teenagers that performs dangerous, stupid and dusgusting tricks(some examples: put a matchbox car in their rectum, shit in their pants, eat some snow with pee (that's for the disgusting), play horn on a golf course, dance nude in tokyo streets, put a firework in their ass (that's for the stupid), stunt with a golf car, gets shot by a riot gun, cross a crocodile river (that's for the dangerous).What will you learn while watching this movie? more that you would expect. It's a rare experience: this is probably the more cruel spectacle that is widely available since the last 50 years. And if you consider that this is entertainement, you can go back to the romain empire or the middle ages! While you're watching, think about why you are hooked/shocked/repulsed by this show!One more question: should you watch it? considering that it is rude and cruel, some people will want to stop after two minutes! So, if you feel like you want to give it a try, borrow it or rent it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't know why so many critics are slamming this movie. OK, so there is absolutely nothing Oscar-worthy, but they didn't like it "because it's not their style." This is one of those movies where if you like the material you'll like the movie (which is probably why such critics as People Magazine and the New York Post loathed it). If you watch the TV show and you like Johnny Knoxville (which if you watch the TV show you should) then yes, I recommend you see it. If you are squeamish, hate the TV show or don't like male nudity then stay away. But if it's co-written and co-produced by Spike Jonze, how bad can it be?</fullReview>

Was glad to see they added the hospital scenes in there so kids dont run off and try the stunts as much. I thought he was dead after the golf cart and Butterbean incidents. Wow. Some gross stuff though - didn't need the vomitcam 5-6 times - once would've sufficed. Giving it a solid B - 8 out of 10. I never really watched the show, so I'd say anyone could walk into this - although a few will definitely be walking out. Just need to leave the brain at the door, people.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Have you ever woken up in the morning after a big night out and have some fleeting memory of doing something a little stupid, or even a lot stupid? Have you ever had a mate ring you the morning after and relate a story of great humour but serious peril that you attempted to achieve the previous night? The human ability to rationalize ridiculous action in the name of intoxication is not only the bonding focus of most groups of friends, but is also the material behind some of the funnier video shows roaming around the globe. But if it so funny, why not do it all the time, why wait with a camera for your kid to fall off a roof or get eaten by a wild badger? Obviously, the team behind Jackass are both revolution psychologists and cunning businessmen. Or, of course, complete and utter fools.Jackass- the movie, is based on the wildly successful Jackass - the show on MTV where a bunch of young adult American clowns take, get beat up like and even eat s*** for their own, and the next generations pleasure. Led by Johnny Knoxville and Bam Magera, the movie has no plot at all, being basically a feature length Skate/Surf/Snowboard movie where instead of males risking all in the name of sport, we have males risking serious maiming and surgery in the name of proving once and for all, which testosterone bag has the balls. It must be said though, when it comes to big balls, you would need mechanical propulsion to orbit these boys in a given lifetime.It may have no plot, but Jackass does have some running themes and one of the funniest Intro sequences ever put in a cinema. I am sorry, but the sight of a thrusting midget in a superman outfit, is enough to make even the oldest, most conservative of viewers tear up with laughter. Although a few of the stunts don't work and quite a few more leave you with belly rumblings of the wrong kind, 90% of the action is laugh generating and the obvious cohesion of the group relays a certain friendship. This could be any morning after, while friends dish out the good news about your drunken attempts to stick fireworks on your rollerskates. You know, to go faster.It is possible to knock Jackass for all that they are worth, which isn't much. Alternatively, you can sit back and enjoy, watching the minds of young boys acted out by fully grown men. It is a shame that all the stunts aren't kept above the table as a complete show, without the gross-out, would've surpasses as a small gem in new-wave comedy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Painful and Gross, but Good Escapism</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film simply consists of a series of compilations of risky stunts and pranks. The men are all in either their late 20's or early 30's yet seem permanently lodged in a perpetual adolescence, which is scary. The pinnacle of humor and satisfaction , in their minds, seems to rest on getting your mother to say the 'F' word and farting in someones face. Of course there is a good natured comraderie about them in one of those 'frat boy' environments. You have to give these guys some credit for the sheer audacity at jumping head first into these crazy stunts.The stunts are more scary and painful than actually funny. You find yourself actually cringing at most of them. In the case of the overturning golf cart you actually think for a minute that Knoxville has broken his neck. (In most cases he probably would have.)It is also EXTREMELY gross. The close up shot of them stitching up the back of Knoxville's head looks like it was made for medical students. There is also graphic shots of puking and vomit. You even see one of them poop in a demo toilet. So instead of giving you the redundant warning of "Don't try these stunts at home" (which only a complete moron would do anyway) I'll just tell you to BE PREPARED.Besides despite all the crazy stunts and gross out stuff it's still the CANDID CAMERA reaction shots of unsuspecting people put into unexpected situations that are still the funniest. Some these include: Knoxville coming back with a smashed up rental car and refusing to pay for it. There is also a segment were they blow loud horns at unsuspecting golfers just as they are about to swing. The best by far is when one fo the mothers comes home to a live alligator in her kitchen. Her looks and shrills of pure terror makes this a keeper to buy when it becomes available on DVD/Video.Since the film has no purported meaning in itself it is up to the viewer to find one. It is interesting that out of all the bravado there is still a lot of homoerotic undertones. There is a abundance of bare male asses and few scenes were they stuff things up their asses (including a TOY CAR!!!!!!!!) There is even a segment where Steve-0 shoves a firecracker in his butt that has a string connected to Party Boys penis. This looks like something taken out of a kinky gay porno. Since most things in life evolve in a circular nature one wonders if what some experts say is right, which is that even the most hetrosexual of male may have some repressed homosexual desires. The pretense maybe to do a 'outrageous stunt' but maybe this is just a 'safe' way to play out dormant desire without getting 'caught'.Also what are the reasons for a viewer to enjoy watching such insane behavior. Could watching someone in pain lessen the pain and problems they have in their own lives. Or is it the fact that the collective intellect of masses may be no more than a 10 year old. Therefore showing rapid fire visual calamity is a gurantee to a sure fire success.It is also interesting to note that alot of these stunts occur in what is otherwise very business like settings. The need to create chaos seems to stem from a certain rebellion to the sterility of modern daily life. Maybe the 'comforts' of modern civilized society have created a sort of boredom that causes this need for crazy behavior and our need to watch it.Overall despite some objectionable qualities it's still very successful escapism. It some ways it's a one of kindThere is surprisingly a very wide use of music styles used and they are well placed. Rip Taylor also appears in a very surprising cameo. Even after all these years he is still his kooky old self.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Plot: There is no plot, there is no story, it is a bunch of guys doing stupid, idiotic things. Jackass was a popular show on MTV and now they turned it into a movie that will make you laugh yourself sick. Now they do things they could of not gotten away with on Television.Do you like action? Do you like comedy? Do you Like Romance (guys humping whale sharks)? Do you like laughing until you fall on the floor? Well then get up and go watch Jackass: The Movie.It had a really funny and original opening sequence. Johnny Knoxville( the leader of the group), Steve-0, Chris Pontius/Party Boy and the rest of the gang were in a giant shopping cart rolling down a bridge and cannons with rocks were blasting at them. They had a lot of celebrities in the movie like Tony Hawk, Mat Hoffman and one of my favourite directors Spike Jones. They did a lot of sequences. They did things like ` Rent a Car Crash Derby'. What they did was rent a car bring it to a crash derby completely destroy it and then they brought it back in pieces and ran away. They also go to Japan and do some sequences. For example `Night of the Pandas' which was one of the best parts of the movie. They also did some really sick stuff which I found gross ( so if you have a light stomach watch out). The end of the movie was the best part in my opinion when they do ` Son of Jackass'. I laughed so hard I fell on the floor.To be honest this is not a movie, its the show expanded into about 1:20 minutes. I am a big fan of the show Jackass. I use to watch it all the time until dumb kids with no lives started to imitate jackass( which it said not to do on the show) The kids got hurt, MTV got sued (more then once) and of course the show got taken off the air. So what they did was make the movie. To make this movie it cost only 2 million. Now Jackass: The Movie has already made over 22 million. So I guess we can expect a sequel.Mark: CWritten By: Claudio De Lisi</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Johnny Knoxville, Steve-O, Bam Margera and all their other buddies from the popular MTV series can now be seen on a movie screen, and I say it's about time a movie this raw, exhilarating and cheerfully insane came along. Like a surreal shot of adrenaline, this movie is pretty much guaranteed to drop your jaw for the whole duration. It also has a kick-ass soundtrack, featuring, among many others, the Ramones, Andrew W.K., and the Vapors.If you know the show, then you know exactly what to expect, because the movie is exactly like it, except it's not censored for television and it's longer. If you're not familiar with the show, then what you're seeing is basically a bunch of funny, likable guys who love to perform dangerous stunts and pranks and catch them on film. That might not sound all that entertaining (especially at feature length), but it definitely is.Some of the stunts do seem to push the limits between funny and just TOO disgusting, but most of the time I was laughing so hard I could hardly breathe. I liked pretty much all the stunts, but I think my very favorite had to be "Roller Disco Truck". If you want to find out what that is exactly though, you'll have to go see it. I'm not telling. Whether you regard the movie as pure, popcorn-munching fun, surreal performance art, or just another sign that our culture is going to hell, one thing is for sure: there is nothing quite like "Jackass: The Movie" anywhere on the market, and in my book, that's a good thing. Oh yeah, and stay for all the credits. ALL of them.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I agree with some other reviewers here that this movie is mostly not funny, however there are definitely a few moments that shock and amuse. Extreme pranks and stunts is the only way to describe it. It's hard to shock anymore these days, so big efforts are required. Are the stunts all genuine? Looks like it. It takes a certain type of stuntman to willingly get beaten up, electrocuted, cut, shot, and other dangerous acts. I don't think it takes a smart stuntman to do these things. Many of the stunts would need to be performed and captured more creatively before it could ever be good performance art. Something tells me though that Jackass isn't trying to be artistic or even clever, rather it revels in its own stupidity.</fullReview>

It's just back to back pranks that are many steps higher than the TV show. It's basically a reality movie, you've got your reality shows, so why not a movie. Some of the stunts these guys pull are absolutely insane, you think to yourself, why someone would even come up with this idea and why would someone want to do it. Jackass: The Movie is just a way for the Jackass gang to get money. (minor spoilers) You've got a shaky camera which is shakier than The Blair Witch Project and you've got prank after prank after prank. None of the pranks connect to each other, but it doesn't matter, it's hilarious! If you're looking for a laugh, this is a good one to watch, however there are some of the more nastier scenes of vomit, urine, blood and feces. It's good movie if you just want to see people making a fool of themselves, and it's a good movie to watch if you wanna see a film with absolutely no point to it except to just laugh!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gentlemen, ladies and assorted minions, this movie had no plot, no direction, no redeeming cinematic virtues whatsoever; that said it was real fun sitting thru it. In a time when any sadomasochist with a literary bent thinks they can put out a good film and be the next Steven Spielberg, Johnny Knoxville and his psychotic crew from MTV's canceled show `Jackass' have no such pretensions. The sheer audacity of this film at times was awe inspiring. In order to perform the various stunts these guys had have special pants tailored to fit there cajoles. Aside from the special entrance and exit, shot specifically for this film, it is composed entirely of skits that the MTV censers felt were a bit much for television. As these are the same people that gave a show to Ozzy Osborne that alone is saying something. It wasn't all roses however. Certain skits resembled more of a horror film trying to gross you out than the comedy it was described as. And several, specifically those involving `Party boy' were just plain lame. On the whole though it's a good way to spend 80 minutes of your life. I'm a bit of a movie snob for those of you who didn't know. From the opening cues of Carmina Burana to the copious explosions at the end. my delicate cinematic sensibilities were offended greatly, still I'm glad I had just returned from doing my laundry, as a fresh change of underwear was necessary.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is not for the faint of heart, Although this is not really a film but it is a story containing hilarious plots to make you laugh like a Donkey. Despite the film will be shown next year here in the Philippines (which I would like to see it again on the big screen), I'm very proud to say that I've seen it first in my vacation recently in Hawaii. I hope the DVD release is worth the wait and the TV series compilation, For I would know this is the first and the last Jackass film were going to see because they are already famous And they have more money now.Thanks for the wonderful laughs Johnny Knoxville and the rest of the cast We're going to miss you and thanks for being a Jackass!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pure mindless fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is about the funniest thing that I have seen in a while. No plot, no script, no time wasted with boorish dialogue, just plain fun. What I find so appealing is that these guys do things that the rest of us find so outlandish that they are funny. And no one in their right mind would attempt any of it. I felt that the movie was too short and did not feature Wee-Man and Party-Boy enough but it still kicked butt. Most people won't enjoy the film because it gets pretty disgusting and juvenilia but I really don't care, it still makes me laugh and that is all this film is supposed to do.</fullReview>

The show obviously was limited to what they can or cannot do,The show differed because the series mostly aimed at victimizing people and capturing the spectators reactions, and that was the funny part. Since the movie had alot more freedom, they perfered to do gross out stunts, which based upon your taste is better or worst. One of the stunts (which you may easily guess) was just plain nasty and not even remotely funny.... Overall I give it a 8/10 its pure entertainment...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Johnny Knoxville and his crew take their hilarious MTV show to the big screen and perform a variety of daring stunts that are funny and dangerous (and sometimes gross). Some of their antics include destroying vehicles, beating each other up, cutting each other's hair with clippers (which gets repetitious), tampering with wildlife (mostly alligators), shoving inanimate objects up their butts, and defecating in stores. Painfully funny, but is not for everyone. Do not attempt any of these stunts at home. My evaluation: *** out of ****.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can't believe that so many people are paying for what they could see for free. This "movie" is a tired copy of the television show, but not as funny. I love the TV show, watch it all of the time. I figured, what the heck, it would be more insanity like that. It wasn't. The movie is forced and there is a lack of new ideas. Quite often, it just resorts to showing feces, rectums and other private parts to be fresh and different. You see some of the same scenes from the TV shows in fact. All of the laughing at each other and insane new clips do not make this movie worth paying full price for. Should have gone straight to video. But then again, there are so few good movies out there, maybe this wins the academy? :)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Some would comment that Jackass isn't a real movie, but who cares when it's so funny!!!!!! Jackass is the type of guilty pleasure that comes along every now and then. The type of "movie" where we can sneak in to alone with a big bucket of popcorn and laugh ourselves silly. Or go with a bunch of friends and laugh until you can't breathe.If you've never heard of the Jackass TV show, it stars Johnny Knoxville and his stunt buddies as they do all kinds of outrageous, disgusting, and often painful stunts in public. Jackass: The Movie contains no real plot, or acting. It's not a documentary by any means. In fact it's probably the worst idea ever conceived for a movie or TV show at all! But if you can just let all that go for about 90 minutes, Jackass may be one of the funniest movies you see all year.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you're looking for a movie in the terms of characters, plot, and conclusion, DO NOT see Jackass. If you are looking to laugh yourself stupid, then you've found the right movie. Based on MTV's show by the same name, Johnny Knoxville and his bunch of loonies are at it again. Needless to say that since this is a movie, they can go all out with their pranks and profanity without worry of a television sensor. It doesn't matter, however, because you'll be laughing the entire movie.There are some points in the movie where you ask yourself "why?" such as the snow cone incident and the fun with bottle rockets. Getting past the gross bodily functions the pranks are VERY funny and I couldn't stop laughing the entire time there. All I can say is this: who doesn't like watching other people make idiots of themselves?</fullReview>

Those who say it is a "flash in the pan" don't realize that Buzzkill, the CKY and other extreme sport/stunt videos have been around since skate kids got camcorders. This movie had me laughing more than any movie with a "plot", and those of you you say it is horrible need to lighten up or get out of the way of a new, more extreme generation.For those of you who are new to this genre, I suggest the CKY trilogy (CKY, CKY2K, and CKY 3, with CKY 4 on it's way), and videos like Destroyer. Also, if you can, try and get ahold of the old MTV series Buzzkill, for it's the grandaddy of them all!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was cracking up at this movie before the opening sequence even had the chance to finish. Little did I know how much funnier it would get. Aside from all the male nudity, I loved all of this movie. Everything they did caused a laugh, groan, or scream for it to stop, but in a good way. They did things people should never do or even think of doing, but if it had to be done, I am glad it was them who did it and not me. Some of the skits they do are things they did on the show, only pushed much, much farther than MTV would ever allow them. The critics may hate it, but the fans of the show will love it. Prepare for a LOT of laughter if you see this movie.</fullReview>

If you haven't seen Steve O's video see that also, its pretty funny to watch once or twice.I cant believe people wrote negative reviews of this movie on this board, especially the guy who only went to see it because he thought the guys were attractive (what?) .. I honestly dont know what they were expecting.Of course it's not a normal movie, dont go into it expecting one and you'll enjoy it alot.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The problem with some people is that they go into Jackass expecting a real movie; perhaps a plot, character development, cinematography, a beautiful score... none of which is here, and none of which should be expected to be here. The title itself explains what the movie is going to be: a bunch of jackasses. These jackasses perform stunts that most people would be terrified to try, which is good because they should never be tried by anyone other than the idiots who are getting paid to make a movie. The stunts, while disgusting, are hilarious. It is human nature (for humans who have a sense of humor) to imagine what it would be like to try things that are obviously beyond the capabilities of a normal human. I myself am scared of experiencing the pain that Knoxville and his companions go through, but am not scared to watch their pain. If they are willing to do it, I'm willing to watch it. Since I can appreciate things that are not exactly normal, I loved this movie. It's very likely that people who saw it and didn't like it, or refuse to see it, on the grounds that it is "childish," "immature," "stupid," "insert 1000 other derogatory adjectives here," are just refusing to admit they like it because they think others will look down upon them.You don't need to be smart to watch this movie. You don't need to understand film or the way it works. You just need to sit back and for 85 minutes forget the film critic in you and enjoy... laugh, scream, vomit, whatever... stop thinking that this is a real film and enjoy it for what it is: an extended version of a collage of pure hilarity.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From beginning to end, Jackass: The Movie will have you slapping your knees, laughing out loud, and howling on the floor. This movie, which was made on a very low budget and contains no plot, nevertheless is more entertaining than most high-budget Hollywood crapshoots with big stars that falls flat at the box office. The stunts are insane, the people who perform them are even MORE insane, and we, the audience, have the privilege of watching them nearly kill themselves in such stunts as off-road golf-cart races, Johnny Knoxville getting a near-lethal bullet shot into his stomach, and Steve-O doing a tightrope walk over a pool of hungry alligators. Not to mention Party Boy doing his hilarious gigolo dance in TOKYO, of all places! There are so many hilariuos stunts, I can't list them all, but I can guarantee that every one of them will have you laughing in spite of yourself. These guys rock!!! Thank you, MTV!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm still piecing together my platitudes to heap upon Punch-Drunk Love, so this'll have to do for now. Live with it.Anyone who watched MTV at all from '99 to '00 saw "Jackass", a TV show hosted by Johnny Knoxville where a bunch of skaters heaped punishment upon their bodies and upon the good sense of the American public. It was funny for some, offensive to others. I found it hysterical, which probably says something about me.Now MTV Films gave them $5 million to make a movie based on their exploits. They said, "Do whatever you want, use that R rating to the best of your ability." And they did.And I haven't laughed this hard in a movie in ages.The things these guys do are simply shocking. (A bit with one of those muscle stimulator exercise gimmicks takes that a bit too literally.) A lot of the movie is just them sitting around their hotel room, wasting time by doing really insane gags. Hilarity involving fireworks, toy cars, yellow snow, and poo ensue.This movie won't be for everyone. I'm smart enough to realize this straight away. But for anyone who doesn't mind laughing at other people's expense for a while, and gets a kick out of seeing how far these people are willing to go for a laugh, then this might be your kind of movie.I've read reviews of people trying to extract some deeper meaning out of this. One guy even extrapolated it into a modern-day Three Stooges kind of routine, slapstick at its most literal. I'm pretty sure that this isn't what these guys had in mind. They just like doing crazy things in front of a digital video camera, and they don't mind doing disgusting things for a giggle.Plus, Steve-O has the absolute best tattoo I've ever seen. It's almost worth seeing the movie just for the tattoo. Take my word for it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Jackass" is not for everybody. Most preferably this is a movie, as a pundit put it, made by jackasses for jackasses. It's a relatively narrow demographic, jackasses comprising mainly of males around 25 yrs of age. It's not a date movie or a chick flick. It's plotless, just a parade of one painful juvenile stunt and prank after another, and dumber than a bag of hammers. The righteous and the politically correct will find much to be offended about. It's rude and crude. It may very well be an indication of the end of Western civilization. But, nonetheless, I laughed long and hard at this movie. I'm genuinely worried about what that says about me. Yes, I laughed when a member of the "cast" got the snot kicked out of him by an oriental female kickboxer and when Johnny Knoxville had to get stitches after his brutal match with a pugilist named Butterbean. Masochism rules here. No one outside the stunt cast is physically injured, although the goats of car rental salesman (upon seeing the state of their rented car returned from a demolition derby) and golfers (who tee off to startling and unwanted airhorn blasts) are sought after. Lots of retching and toilet business, soiled underwear, and anatomical fascinations</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although there are many other movies out there to see...and probably better ones, I do in fact recommend seeing Jackass: The Movie. It's exactly like the television show, but with all the profanity and nudity that you couldn't see on t.v., and with it's well-deserved R-rating, it is indeed one of the funniest movies that I have seen. Though I am just laughing at others misfortune and idiots doing crazy, and often disgusting stunts, I cannot deny that I thoroughly enjoyed myself while watching this movie. And this, coming from an 18 year old female may surprise you due to the fact that the majority of Jackass viewers are all teenage boys, but if you enjoy stupid people doing stupid things, this is definitely you're kind of movie. It is hilarious, so be ready to laugh, and be ready to view some of the most vile and dangerous stunts. But, ultimately, just be ready to have a good time at the expense of Johnny Knoxville, Steve-O, Party Boy, and the rest of the Jackass gang.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>That's right..For those who doubt my description above of the hysterically funny "Jackass: The Movie" should rent David Cronenberg's serious movie "Crash"Both movies are about people who create sexual fetishes out of intense situations.. Cronenberg's "Crash" is about people who derive sexual pleasure from Car Crashes.."Jackass" is about a group of tight-knit guys who bond over a series of masochistic stunts. Whether one of the guys deliberately subjects himself to serious paper-cuts (inflicted by another guy), to voluntarily snorting wassabi mustard like cocaine, to one guy's insertion of a condom-encased matchbox toy car up one's ass after much lubrication, (the doctor who takes the X-ray presumes that the guy is gay) these guys are obviously deriving intense pleasure over the experience.That these situations constantly involve nudity or semi-nudity adds to the sexualizing of these masochistic stunts. What "Jackass" provide is an SadoMascochistic sensibility without actual "traditional" sex involved. Only those in the know will pick up on what's really going on here. The rest see only what they want to see.It's is clear these guys adore one another. Whether or not any of these guys are actually gay is not the point.. What is presented here so obviously functions as a form of pornography.. The dangerous situations are the sex scenes.Given all that I said: I am a gay man.. I laughed myself silly over this movie, and loved it alot!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining gags? Hell nope! Just guilty pleasures for the warped minds...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm frankly surprised to learn that this movie tops this weekend's box office. If a ceaseless explosion of grossly sick and dangerous takes on deranged, human misbehavior is not to be snubbed, but seen as pleasurable fun and humor, sadly, the viewers' heads ought to be examined. I can live without watching these `Pee-Wee' characters exposing their guilty pleasures in front of the camera! Honestly, what's there to laugh about guys whose bodies are in crying need for corsets to disguise their abundance of bumpy bulges. And should men showing their horrendous and warped ways of masturbation worth the slightest applause? Frankly not and they should be kept behind bars to rot! And guys going to the length of considering urine and poo for oral consumption ought to be thrown into the pig-style for the rest of their days. Nope, I didn't find any of the sick-jokes funny. It's one movie littered with nothing but filth and distortedly masochistic and sadistic mentality that spins guilty pleasures for the confused and unbalanced minds! And rightly, it ended with a WARNING! God forbid, I just hope these creatures aren't walking the face of the earth in real life...My rating: F</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you are not a jackass fan then you have no right to see or put down this movie. This movie is stupid,pointless and the most fun thing I've seen in a theater in years. Some of the gags do miss but the good ones are so funny I had tears in my eyes. Go see this with a bunch of friends after having a few and you will love it even more.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>WARNING SPOILERS BELOW!!!!This film is not for the faint of heart or weak of stomach. It is totally lacking in plot , Good taste, acting credibility, and everything else that defines most great films. But putting this in the same boat with American Pie would be unfair. There was so much more to this movie.First of all I wouldn't recommend anyone going into this without a "preview". You NEED to sample at least one episode of The Show on MTV. If you turn the channel before the end of the show you need not waste your money on this one. That's all this movie is, a Too Hot For TV Jackass! That and a true blockbuster opening and ending scene. There were a few scenes that had even me looking away from time to time. I mean a Bottlerocket being shot out of someone's a** is not that funny but it will effective drop your jaw to the floor. Even the camera crew puked at a few of the revolting stunts performed by these guys. But all the nastee parts aside I know of NO other movie if ever seen where I'm actually Stomping my feet on the ground trying to get the air back in my lungs from laughing so hard. I got cramps in my cheek mucles from the permanent smile provoked by most of the scenes. My Brother recently had his appendix removed and to save his life I recommended he Not See this movie. But if you had a strong constitution and an open mind, Go See It!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think anyone who is going to criticize this movie for not being an art film is going to have to get it together before they attempt to see this film. Unless you have been under a rock the past couple of years, everyone knows this is based on the MTV Series of the same name. I personally went in for a laugh and came out crying and a headache from laughing so hard, and I wasnt alone. I thought the movie had one of the best opening sequences to a comedy film that ive ever seen, it was perfect. Of course, even being a guy, there were a couple of scenes that got me. But over all, I loved it, I'm a fan of the TV series and I'm a fan of the movie. And I wasn't the only one, the whole audience was in stitches. So, if your planning to see a merchant/Ivory production here, look elsewhere, this is the same odd ball, slapstick, gross-out humor you seen on the Show, Consider yourself now warned, but I suggest it. thanks.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>* possible spoliers*OK a rented car gets totaled in a demolition derby to the tune of Slayer's 'Angel of Death'. If ever there was a scene made for me...this was it.My fiance and I saw this last night and we both laughed from start to finish. However we are both big fans of the CKY stuff and we are both into skating and all the goof ball crude fun that we have with our friends is oddly reminicient of the stuff in Jackass. Maybe I haven't taken a dump in a hardware store toilet, but I have seen a kid eat a yellow snow cone.This movie is not for everybody, and critics and 'straights' will pan it, but if you like the show, you'll love the movie. We didn't want it to end and the 80 minutes flew by. I can't wait to see what they'll cram on the DVD because I know they have hours of out-takes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I laughed almost entirely all the way through this movie, if you want to call it that. It's basically just the same thing on MTV except more of a production value, different locations and the ability to cuss. Very funny, except for some reason, some of these guys REALLY like to see each other's private parts if you know what I mean. Their core demographic really don't like that sort of thing, but I guess you have to put up with it to get to the stuff you do like. Anyway, it was funny, just a little too gay at times.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>for fans of the tv series, it culls out the more boring stunts, leaving just the most crass and obnoxious ones.for newcomers, it's a lesson in self-deprecation and self-defication. there's a solid allotment of anal stunts and homoerotic humor, plus a healthy dose of vomiting, blood, and general masochism.i laughed from beginning to end.it did seem a big 'stagey' at some points... like the previous poster mentioned about the padding in the opening scene, but the overwhelming number of authentic stunts subdues that concern almost immediately.regardless, you'll leave the cinema wondering why trent lott and orin hatch haven't tried to ban this yet.oh yeah, the opening tune is from 'o fortuna' by orff. one of the most overused pieces of classical music.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've been a fan of the show since it premiered on MTV. These guys are absolutely nuts and do things that are so crass, disgusting, and lewd that one can't help but laugh.The movie one-ups the TV show by showing stunts that would never pass the TV censors. Some bits are side-splittingly hilarious while others are just plain gross and go well beyond good taste.But, as the title says, high-art this certainly isn't. It's just plain old juvenille fun...Fans of the show won't be disappointed. The only people that might not find it funny are those who don't enjoy gross-out humor..In any event, it's certainly worth seeing at least once. I, for one, wasn't disappointed.</fullReview>

The guys tried very hard to make this good and they met that goal and then some. It's just fun. No lame jokes or flimsy plot like most comedies these days, just a bunch of crazy guys being just that. This movie gets an 10 outta 10. Go see it, you'll enjoy it unless you keep your shoes in an uncomfortable place (like some where Ryan Dunn might keep a toy car).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the funniest movies I've ever seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Apparently some members of the Christian Coalition are reviewing Jackass on IMDB today. I'm here to tell you that the cast of Jackass are not heathens, but are in fact comic pioneers. In the late 1960s a British comedy troupe called Monty Python changed comedy forever. Today Jackass is doing the same thing. There were those who found Monty Python crude and wrong too, but people like that are doomed to an existence of close minded boredom. If you watch the promo spots for the movie you will see how much pleasure Knoxville and company get out of watching the crowd laugh at them. Jackass is funny, that is all it is meant to be. Much of Jackass is gross out humor, but it's really funny gross out humor. This film is not for kids at all, but mature adults will die laughing at some of the taboos Jackass so carelessly throws aside. Maybe I'm sick, but watching Jackass on the big screen was like a breath of fresh air from all the crap that Hollywood puts out every weekend. Thank god for Jackass.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You have to be a teenager</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw Jackass: The Movie this weekend and realized that only teenagers (people around my age) would like this movie. If you're an adult, you might find this movie offensive and wonder why anyone would waste their money to go to the movie theater and see it. There were some adults in the theater who just sat their and didn't make a sound. All the teenagers in the theater, which was mostly who was in the theater, were laughing because we watch the show and find this stuff funny. Why is that when adults see movies that are basically for kids and teenagers, they automatically have to say how bad it is or was and what a waste of time and money it is or was. Not all adults are like this but it sure seems to be that way. Why can't you adults just keep your mouths shut and let us teenagers enjoy whatever movies we want to watch and spend money to see. Just because you don't like it doesn't mean we won't. Every person in that movie theater under about 25 was laughing. If you know the movie's going to be stupid, why would you go and see it in the first place? I just don't understand you adults.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I hate it when people do not realize the type of movie they go to see. If you think the show is dumb, you will think the movie is dumb. If you think the show is funny you will think the movie is funny. You can't go into this movie expecting a plot, great acting, or amazing special effects because there isn't any. It's a compilation movie of skits an pranks, that's it. It is hilarious, I have never laughed that much at any movie. Remember, it's low brow humor, if something is funny then it's funny, who cares if it is gross or if it offends someone? Some of you people out there need to develop a sense of humor and not be so PC all the time. The people who didn't like this movie should probably go see the Jerry Seinfeld movie instead. As for Jackass, if you're a fan of the show, you'll love the movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jackass the movie, was one of the funniest things i ever saw. It was non stop laughter all the way through. Im a big fan of the TV show, and i have been waiting for this movie to come out ever since i heard about it like 3 months ago. I went with a bunch of friends all fans too, most of us don't have sattlelight therefore we don't have MTV, but still the whole bunch of us are fans from downloading eps and clips of all sorts. I have to say here in Canada, well in Toronto for sure, there is quite a fanbase here.Anyways, about the movie, it was great, not only did i laugh at the movie, but i also laughed at all those people leaving the movie with disgusted looks on their faces. YOU ARE ALL IGNORANT! hah hah, its your fault for not knowing what you were going into when you got that ticket. The title and poster and commercials alone gotta give the viewers enough information of what the movie is about. Plus, if you are one of those that said your friends forced you to see the movie, i must say : YOU ARE ALL LIL BITCHES, lil bitches to your friends you are! No mind of your own yes? Need to be told where to go yes? Well i don't really care, the money still goes to the movie, and you leave a few bucks poorer.Now where was i.. oh yeah the movie was hilarious, an extened uncensord tv show it was. Those discamer don't mean anything, my friend punched me in the lungs, we all faught got kicked outta the theatre and the mall, IM A JACKASS AND IM PROUD! hoooray! . oh but my ONLY critisism of the movie was that its too short, the whole theatre sounded a bit disapointed that it ended, but i think i heard somewhere that on the DVD will be featuring a meecrab load of deleted footage.now to wait again till 2063! goodbye</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Exhilarating from beginning to end, the stunts performed in this collection of sketches capture the spirit of the Gung-Ho filmmaking of many Hong Kong actioners which could care less about actor safety, where Hollywood would cringe. The movie does not bring a plot to the series of stunts, nor a justification to the masochism. Verging on slapstick and putting its stuntmen on the verge, this movie curiously satisfies by providing the thrill of seeing an incredible feat or a being in an extreme situation and comic relief ranging from crude campy humor to the purely coincidental irony of nature simultaneously, without the aid of a coherent backbone to explain the succession of activities performed. 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A while into the film my cheeks and mouth started hurting from laughing so much, I glanced at my watch and to my dismay I was only 20 minutes into this film. I didn't think I could withstand another 60 minutes, it was going to be too painful. But the movie was so incredibly funny, I had to.Don't go see this movie if you don't like Jackass, it's not going to change your mind. If you do like Jackass and you haven't yet seen this film, stop reading this immediately and drive to your nearest theatre.Although it may be argued that this isn't actually a movie, I have *never* laughed so hard and so continuously in a movie theatre in my entire life. Unlike most of the 25 episodes that air on MTV this movie suffers from no lulls in the action and humor.It's good. See it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm amazed at how a low-budget, plot-free film could have become so incredibly hilarious. Knoxville and his crew of insane friends and stuntmen spend two incredibly short hours causing chaos, hilarity, and puzzled looks from passers-by wherever they go. This formula never gets tired, since each stunt surpasses the previous, in humor and in raw pain. Knowing that these people ACTUALLY crash through ceiling fans, dance in speedos in public, and get punched in the crotch every few scenes adds to the cringe factor. Knoxville really knows how to edit each scene for both surprise and suspense, and often you won't know what the prank is going to be until it's already begun. Hopefully the dvd will carry a few extra hours of edited scenes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Never have I witnessed a film so unique and inspired since `Jackass: the movie.' This film shall not fear the wrath of critics, for they don't know what the youth of America's culture has risen to. The `skits' or `segments' in this movie are the most elaborate and genius anti-climatic flickering images I have ever witnessed. The great thing about watching this film is also watching the audience's reactions. This movie plays games with your emotions and will put you through a series of them.At times you will cringe and at times you will wonder why they are doing this to themselves. It is more of an art then an act of self-mutilation. The Ontario Film Board Review has given this movie a Canadian rating `R' for: Coarse Language, Violence, Crude Content, May Offend Some, and Torture. It deserves this rating and it's equivalent to an NC-17 American rating. It is imperative for some to experience this film because no matter how much you loathe it or love it you will always remember it.The long two-month delay has been worth it, thank you yet again for sacrificing your own selves all in the name of entertainment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>MILD SPOILERS ****************"Jackass: The Movie" is offensive and mesmerizing all at once. In the same way that a gruesome car crash will hypnotize drivers into slowing down for a guilty peek, Johnny Knoxville's crew will keep you in your theatre seat until after the credits are done.My god. I enjoyed this demented piece of human stupidity. I ripped my gut laughing, and I covered my eyes in horror...exactly what I wanted from a night of inane stunts!FLAVOR OF THIS MOVIE: slapstick hilarity, juvenile stupidity, and complete irreverence towards responsible living. If you are attracted to seeing this movie, you will get a tremendous rush, especially from the first half of the film.HIGHLIGHTS OF THIS MOVIE: 90% of the film is preposterous sight gag and physically-perilous stuntwork; guaranteed to please the action lovers. Tightope walking above alligators, skateboarding in sumo suits, demolition derbies in golf carts, taping bottle rockets to rollerblades, pole vaulting in public, bungee wedgie jumping, and faux burglaries: all of these are crowd pleasing stunts, and a must-see for all Jackass fans.DOWNSIDES OF THIS MOVIE: The second half of the movie slows down and becomes less perilous and more gruesome. Additionally, 10% of the overall footage is gore and bile and toilet humor. The yellow snow cone, butt-launched fireworks, wasabi snorting, plumbing store poo pranks, paper cuts, and genital-zapping will be too much for most viewers. If you cover your eyes or look away for these 5 minutes of the show, you should be OK...just know that these nasties are going to be part of the package.OVERALL: I got every penny worth of what I expected from "Jackass". Absurd hilarity, extreme human stupidity, and recklessness that even Fear Factor can't match.If you are at all inclined to see this, then go, and pay full price. Just don't eat too much greasy food prior to the show... you might be challenged to keep your dinner down.p.s. Make sure you stay until after the credits are complete. There is a nice little trailer added to the end of the movie.5 kernels of popcorn out of 6.</fullReview>

This movie will have you on the edge of your seat laughing without belief. Try going to this movie not to laugh, or cringe or even gasp, its impossible. Increadbly creative and I loved the whole movie, Im seeing it again tommrow. The really disapointing fact is that Jeff Termanie gets to take all the credit even though Bam Margera created this kind of humor (CKy, CKy2k, CKy3) but didn't have the money to produce something like this when he started out.</fullReview>

I've never laughed through the entire run-time of a movie. As I was walking out of the movie theater I couldn't beleive the pain in my sides and my jaw from laughing for so long and so hard!Fans of the show will be treated to the Mecca of Jackass episodes, basically, and people who don't follow Jackass and what they do might be turned off. You see a lot of stuff you don't necessarily want to see, but it's all part of the gag.Even though almost all movie theaters are trying to card teens trying to get in, you can't stop kids from getting into this movie!

		<shortDescription>The funniest movie ever to hit the face of the earth....literally.....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jackass: The Movie, is literally, the funniest thing I have ever seen in my entire life. The show was down right funny, but since the movie is completely uncensored, its even more funnier. This film, will in fact stir up lots of controversy, but that will make it even more popular. The stunts in this film are ****ing funny, but lots of other things in the movie is funny, such as clever lines. This movie has no acting, and no plot, and for that, I deem it very original. Some clever lines in this movie was Johnny Knoxville repeating "This goes on the gouch!" Another funny line, was Bam Margera's dad telling Bam that he's completely lost it (what makes that line so funny, is the fact that Phil is sitting on the toilet saying that). When I went into the theater today, I already knew that this movie would be great, and it was. Everyone in the theater was laughing, and I also might add that there was a pretty good amount of people in the theater. Most of the stunts in this movie is completely outrageous. The part where Johnny Knoxville paper cuts "the webbing" of his hands, and feet, looked very painful. The fact that this movie only had a budget of 5 million dollars, was pretty amazing. The only thing I don't like about Jackass: The Movie, was the fact that it wasn't long enough, but hey, it still had LOADS of laughs. The funniest stunts, and the most sickest, were "Yellow Snow cone", and the stunt where Dave England took a crap in the toilet at the hardware store. This movie is the funniest thing I have ever seen, in fact, it ranks number 1 on my top ten best. 10 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Jackass: The Movie' was something I really wasn't looking forward to. Let's face it, even at 30 minutes the TV show rang long and was mostly unsatisfying. Fans of the series will then be pleasantly surprised that is this is a great blend of great sketches (some of which are reminiscent of pranks done before).To the uninitiated, Jackass is sort of a mix between Candid Camera, a Hollywood stunt show, and a skater video. The collective of Jackass is made up of about a half-dozen guys in their mid-20s who apparently fear no pain. You'll see them attacked by crocodiles, swimming with sharks, and going to every extreme -- in effect, you end up seeing a Wile E. Coyote cartoon in real life. If you find someone trampolining themselves into a functioning, working ceiling fan hilarious (or even slightly intriguing) then you need to check this out. Note that more of the humor leans towards non sequitur and the general odd dissonance of movies like 'Being John Malkovich' (director Spike Jonze is behind the scenes a lot of times in Jackass) rather than all-out grossfest of something like 'Freddy Got Fingered'.If you've read so far and it seems even slightly interesting, you owe yourself to go see a showing of this and enter it with an open mind.10/10 (For its genre)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Check your pretension at the door, and witness the culmination of comedy's latest movement. This triumphant feature is sure to induce ten times the laughter of any "gross-out comedy" pablum Hollywood can turn out. There's no plot, there's no cohesion, and the thing's even shot mostly on the same MiniDV cameras as the TV show, but it doesn't matter. The R rating simply means no bleeps and all the un-blurred scrotums one could ask from a major motion picture. There are a few pranks, such as the frame sequences and the old men make-up, that smack of a few extra dollars, but for the most part this movie's $4 budget proudly goes to g-string marble holders and fireworks. Oh, the fireworks! The old guard of critics will probably hack this thing to pieces, but it's not their film. This is for the legion of idiots out there who see the fun in crapping all over social convention, and doing it proudly. Granted, I'm not gonna insert anything into my anus or fight Butterbean in a store, but we can all subvert in our own special ways. If you're the type who sees the high art in "Freddy Got Fingered," or can laugh when old people fall all the time, you'll be at home with "Jackass: The Movie." If not, check out "White Oleander" in the small theater in the corner.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you are fan of this cult MTV programme, then this film will have you in stitches. It makes the TV show look tame, as each stunt outdoes the next. It has no plot and is just a longer more outrageous version of the TV show. It is not for the faint hearted, as many of the viewers who I sat with, kept turning their head away during various scenes. Steve O snots Wasabi and partakes in a Bungie wedgie. Bam Margera surprises his parents by sticking a real live alligator in their kitchen. Johnny Knoxville is shot by a riot control projectile bag in the stomach and endures paper cuts between his toes and fingers. One dude urinates on a snow cone and then eats it, another guy sticks a toy car up his anus and goes for an X-Ray. "Wee-Man" kicks himself in the head and 2 men stick shrimps down their crotches and get whale sharks to eat off them. I could go on, but this will spoil it for you.

		<fullReview>Appropriately labeled "dickhouse production," this is a movie version of the MTV show. "Jackass" had been in the news for encouraging viewers to try the stunts they see on television, resulting in injuries. The film version features even more dangerous stunts. The opening advises, "do not attempt any of the stunts you're about to see," but everyone knows someone who did this stuff anyway. We begin with Johnny Knoxville smashing up a rental and trying to return it to the dealer; something similar was done by Bob Barker on "Truth or Consequences". Jeff Tremaine takes Steve-O, Ban Margera, Chris Pontius and the rest to Japan for many of the stunts. The men shed their clothing and put their balls on the chopping block. Some of the skits are entertaining, but they venture into repulsive. The end result leaves a stench.** Jackass the Movie (10/21/02) Jeff Tremaine ~ Johnny Knoxville, Steve-O, Bam Margera, Chris Pontius</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yeah, you could easily say this 'a new low' in movies. You could say it is 'a plunge into the society we don't want' and you could say it is 'vile', 'grotesque', 'disgusting' and 'sickening'. But when you have a movie as funny as this, none of that matters! Jackass: The Movie is a series of stunts and gags too nasty to put on the TV show. Johnny Knoxville, Bam Margera, Ryan Dunn, Steve-O, Dave England, Chris Pontius, Ehren McGehey, Wee Man, Preston Lacy, and others are the old-enough-to-know-better guys performing this gross-out stuff. Rockets Skates, Tropcal Pole Vaulting, Rent-A-Car Crash Up Derby, and Alligator Tight Rope are among the insane segments in this insane spectacle.Jackass doesn't have much to offer except gross-out humour, and plenty of belly laughs (If you like this sort of thing, but it isn't trying to offer anything more. Many would say 'Who would want to watch a group of MEN doing the most childish, pathetic and senseless things, just to satisfy their immature needs?' Well, some people like playing football, some people like cooking, some people like painting; these guys like doing crazy stuff it's as simple as that.The bottom-line is, You either love it or you hate it, and I am proud to say I love it! JACKASS IS AWESOME !!!!!! 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie has no plot, no story and absolutely nothing that your average critic looks for in a movie. Except pure comedy and action.Most people would shake their heads and say "No!", but i think this movie deserves a chance.Most of us have seen at least one episode of Jackass before, and this is basically multiple episodes strung together, but I have to say, it's brilliant! Despite all the negative comments, I have to give this movie a whopping 8 out of 10. if you want romance, see Titanic. If you are like me and like to see people performing stunts like these, watch Jackass: The Movie!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is basically a compilation of never-before-seen Jackass skits. It is something to watch at the end of a long, hard day. It will certainly put a smile on your face, and just might make you bust a gut.Some highlights- - Several appearances by party-boy - Clamping baby-alligators to Steve-O's nipples - Trampolining into ceiling fans - Taking a dump in a hardware store toilet (he takes a dump in his pants first because he can't hold it) - Shaving a patch of each other's hair from behind by surprise Quality stuff. Watch it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think Bam Margera is the best part of the movie because he is so sexy but about the movie i thought it was hilarious i hope that they make a Jackass the movie 2 and i forgot to say that Steve-O is also very sexy.My favorite parts of this movie was when they put firecrackers in their cracks and shot them.Also i liked when Bam woke his parents up with the fireworks that was funny.I still watch this movie even though it is 4 years old.I cant get enough of the laughter and the stupid stunts they do.It has to hurt when Steve-O snorts the wasabi up his nose,and when they do the paper cuts on Johnny's fingers and toes and on Steve-O's mouth.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After a opening of high quality footage of the guys in a giant trolley, you think for this movie that they went up a notch of their production values, while O Fotuna is bellowing in the background. But right after this opening sequence we're taken back to the low quality, rough camera work of the series, and when this happens strap yourself in for one disturbing ride of painful laughing.While this is just a ninety minute episode of Jackass, they have gone abit further in their stunts. Though it feels that they are just trying to push the envelope further for our amusement, it still sends you into painful fits of laughter. It is quite disturbing some of the stunts they perform, while others are just sheer stupidity, yet you succumb to it all having a great time watching all this depravity.Your either going to love this or simply hate it. But if you one the people who love it, come join me on the floor and roll around in laughter.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is funny in places, but terribly unfunny in others, with lots of gross out gags and wacky stunts!. The characters are all great and quite funny, and I did find myself laughing hard in some scenes, plus Johnny Knoxville is simply amazing in this!. This movie is definitely not for everybody, as there are some seriously sick gags here, but I just couldn't help but laugh at a lot of them!, plus one of the funniest scenes in the movie for me is when There messing around in the bowling alley ( I won't spoil it for you). The whole cast really seemed to be having a lot of fun, and another one of my favorite scenes is when one of them decides to go take a dump in one of the toilets at the toilet store!. There's plenty of puking, sh*it,P*ss and lots of other gross stuff, and some of the bumps these guys took were just amazing!, however it's just there are a lot of hit and miss gags, and quite a few of them just didn't work. I was actually surprised by how much I was laughing though, and I really hope they make a sequel to this!, plus the skateboard stunts were really cool!. This is funny in places, but terribly unfunny in others, with lots of gross out gags and wacky stunts!, I highly recommend it. The Direction is OK. Jeff Tremaine does an OK job here, with decent camera work, however, it's inconsistent, he still did alright though. The Acting isn't required here. Johnny Knoxville is funny as hell, and is one of the main reasons I laughed so hard in some places while watching this!, as he really seemed to be having fun, and I had a fun time watching him! (Knoxville Rules!!!). The rest of the gang do just fine. Overall I highly recommend it. ***1/2 out of 5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>At their worst</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At their best, Jackass the group manages to be hilariously funny or absolutely disgusting. They don't leave anybody calm. The group has made several nice episodes on TV, which contain some of their best material. What this movie offers you, are the most dangerous stunts that could have ruined Johnny Knoxville's health. The movie tries to be extreme in many ways and it can well claim the title of worst movie of all time.Steve-O appears to be the ultimate clown, who steals the show and makes the Spiderman look like a postman. Steve-O manages to be the funniest dude on the show, without even being the most disgusting jackasser. The most disgusting stunts belong to those jackassers, who are also the least favourite ones. When you watch that disgusting stuff, you just think that now they have finally made that on a movie, applauds! If you want to have this movie, you should have it on DVD, because it contains some extremely hilarious extra material. 'The mustard assault' is a classic from Bam and his gang. Also Chris Pontius 'anatomy lesson' on beach is a superb extra bit. The DVD has also two commentary tracks.It is very difficult to rank this movie, because normal criteria don't apply. Basically, this movie is a horrible nonsense, which would receive the lowest possible rank. While the movie still manages to be funny because of its 'actors', and not because of its lack of quality, it would be something like 4 donuts out of 10.</fullReview>

We both had seen Knoxville in M.I.B.(was it 2?), but didn't realize the talent, which is also known as insanity, until we beheld Johnny and his troupe of Jackassians doing their "thang" or "thangs" as it were. Anyway, we both would have liked this stuff when we were teens as much as we like it now in our 'pre-golden' years. I should mention we both like a very wide range of entertainment and also have both been deemed medically unfit, but if we were "normal" I think we would still give it 4 thumbs and 4 big toes up---way up.d.jones</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I hated it, then I liked it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember the first time I saw this movie. A girl friend of mine had rented it out and so she, myself, and my room-mate, sat down to watch it. I hadn't heard of the movie previously (a result from living in rural Australia), so I had no idea what we were getting into, and my expectations were... well, a little high. I expected a movie. With plot lines and all. Anybody who's seen it knows how dead wrong I was.The first time I saw the film, I think I was just aggravated that I had to sit and watch a bunch of grown men make idiots of themselves with shaky cameras and a slew of cuss words than watch some other video we'd rented. I didn't laugh at all. I got up and made myself a drink and then went to bed, telling my mates to get me when it was over. Maybe I was even experiencing PMS and I was wishing to hurt the friend who decided to rent it out in the first place.It wasn't until just a month or so ago that on a whim I picked up the DVD on sale at my local store, and brought it home to watch again. I knew what I was expecting this time, and lo and behold - I laughed. I positively cracked up. The opening scene with the massive shopping cart was hilarious, and I especially enjoyed the antics between Bam Margera and Ryan Dunn with beautiful timing between the music played and the blows given. The rest of the movie needs no detail. Bottle rockets, diarrhoea, crashing rental cars, alligators in kitchens, getting shot in the stomach and zapping various body parts with electricity all feature here. With the hand held cameras and in your face angles, it helps to make you feel almost like part of the gang - as if these men are your mates doing a lot of stupid crap on film for sh!ts and giggles. You should feel right at home, right?Highlights? When the boys dress up as old men and crash their carts; the roller disco truck; April Margera and the alligator; sweaty fat f!cks; the giant cone; clipper cam; wasabi snooters; the bungee wedgie; paper cuts and ... Nevermind. Everything in the film is bound to get a grin or a grimace. Something I found amusing in particular was the ending, "Son of Jackass". Nothing like seeing these guys as a bunch of old men, staggering to their numerous violent deaths.The Special Collector's Edition DVD has even more for your delight. Outtakes, bonus scenes, trailers, making of, and even some promo spots, curtesy of the Margeras. More stupid stunts, and you even get to see how badly Bam Margera treats his father. Now that's what I call a bonus!I even sat down recently and made my 40 something parents watch the film, and they laughed harder than I ever did. My mother was in tears, gasping for air during the segment with the guys in their fat suits, skateboarding and riding their bikes. My father laughed as Ryan Dunn got his butt kicked by a kickboxing champion and they both laughed together as a bottle rocket singed Steve-O's gluteus maximus. With that in mind, I suppose it doesn't just appeal to teens or juvenile men. And yes, I admit that I sometimes put on the film when I'm doing my school work or reading, just to have Steve-O soothing "Yeah dude!" playing in the background amidst fits of cussing and yelling and laughing. Stupid, juvenile, idiotic.. But funny in it's immaturity. Guys who are stupid enough to do this stuff can't help but make you grin - even if it's as you tell yourself it's because you think they're a bunch of jackasses and not because it appeals to the delinquent inner child in all of us.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SOME SPOILERSFinally, a movie who's name directly tells the audience what they're watching. I mean, seriously, you can only use your imagination so far to what movies with name's like Solaris or Requiem for a Dream are about. With a title like Jackass, there leaves no surprises.Jackass: The Movie is a collection of short skits involving painful skateboarding wipe outs, Panda bear costume hijinx and urine flavored frozen treats. The film, while awfully disgusting some of the time....most of the time....pretty much all of the time, is still far past funny enough to make your stomach hurt, tears role down your face and your cheeks feeling stretched by the end.In the past Jackass has been blamed for countless other copycat morons to not only light themselves on fire, or jump off of a hotel building into a pool, but film it as well. As I strongly feel it is my duty, I must warn that if you are either a boy, a teenager, a teenage boy or a member of any college fraternity, you should more then likely not watch this movie.Being a Jackass. It's not just a movie, it's a way of life.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*** Major Spoilers ***Well, where to begin with this cinematic gem? I had wondered what all I'd see in this movie. There's really nothing that tells one what to expect, it just tells one that it's gross, funny, stupid, etc. All of those are correct to a degree, but in the interest of making the public better prepared for the experience, here's what you can expect to see: Penises, Testicles, buttocks, human feces, a son physically assaulting his father, a man who sodomized himself with a toy car, men tying lit bottle rockets to their penises, public defecation, men consuming their own bodily fluids, men tricking whale sharks into giving them oral sex (or trying), men electrically shocking their own genitals, men slicing open the skin between their toes, and loads of other things that are a bit more disturbing.If this sounds like your kind of entertainment, I pity you, but you'll love the movie. I must admit however, that there were parts that were really funny. Overall, finally a movie that may not be too high brow for the average moviegoer. 4/10</fullReview>

You'll be entertained at the expense of the, well, Jackasses on screen as they snort wasabi, electrocute their testicles, stick toy cars...um...places and a million other completely retarded stunts. If you're easily amused this will make your top 10. If you liked Chocolat or the Pianist, you'll hate this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good for laughs, but not for the faint of stomach</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I would say faint of heart but really in this case it is more like stomach. This movie is was really funny. If you're in the market to laugh hard and laugh the whole time this is a good one to go and see.However (very minor spoiler alert here) I used to work at a retirement home and have several friends in the health care industry. We've seen it all and any one of us could tell you some stories that would make your appetite go away. Here comes the spoiler: The two things about this movie that are difficult to watch are watching people vomit and the actions that these people do that make themselves/others around them vomit.Amongst this films better qualities would be the opening sequence. It was hilarious. The trailer for it went into the opening sequence briefly but didn't really do it justice. There are a few unexpected elements to it but the ultimate result was pretty obvious. The other more amusing bits include a trip to a car rental place and the scenes that take place in Japan. If you like to see people do the kinds of things you would never try in a million years and you've got a strong stomach, go and see this in the theater. However if your only reason for seeing it was to satisfy curiosity, I would recommend renting this. In addition, be careful what you eat while watching this. It would be very easy to watch some of the scenes and think twice about the nacho cheese in front of you. I rate this one 7 out of 10 for the laughs.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Anyone who has seen MTV's Jackass on TV will know what to expect from the movie - Stunts, Pranks and Stupidity! The movie is arranged in sequences just as the show was, with Johnny Knoxville as the main attraction. The bits are (for the most part) very funny and clever, including destroying a rental car in a destruction-derby, then returning it with a straight face; ruining a defunct mini-golf complete with large plastic characters by driving golf carts through it; taking on a champion boxer (Butter-Bean) in a department store, and others!I have only two caveats for this movie.One is the generally low-quality video in some of the sequences, due to filming with a hidden camera (at night) and a 'Blair Witch-esque' nausea-inducing jiggle to about a third of them.The other is the Homo-Erotic content, which is even more prevalent in the movie than in the edited TV show. Be warned, you're going to see a lot of 'wierd' stuff.All in all, I would recommend this for anyone who has a slightly twisted bend to their sense of humor, and probably would not make a good film to bring the girlfriend to unless she shares it also.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Theoretically, this should be my favorite movie of all time. I hated 'The Royal Tenenbaums', a paragon of the upscale humor I don't ever find funny. I couldn't stand the movie, it grated on my nerves and after it was over I remember thinking to myself, "Man, I'll take fart jokes and physical comedy any day!"So why, pray tell, do I not find 'Jackass: The Movie' funny? It's a mystery the world will probably never solve. The sort of antics which occur in this movie are the antithesis of the type of humor I loathe, so I should be holding the shenanigans of J.K., Steve-O and the gang up on a pedestal. However, if you were to ask me what my favorite part of this movie was, nothing would come to mind. I don't find crashing up rental cars funny. I fail to see how paper cuts caused by manila folders are hilarious. And I especially don't find eating a urine-soaked snowcone (and sucking every last drop out of the cup) so disgusting that I have to laugh - rather, I just find it stupid. I find all of it stupid, and it appalls me that other human beings find it funny. Have we all turned back into ten year-olds? I didn't vomit and I didn't find it sick or twisted, but I certainly didn't laugh at all.Actually, now that I think about it, I'm pretty sure I know why I didn't like 'Jackass': There's a very clear line between 'funny' and 'too far' and the CKY crew are on the latter side of that line for the entire movie. Who would do such things? Jackasses. So I guess they got their point across better than that hack Tom Green could. Gotta give them credit for that. Don't go to the theater expecting anything and certainly make sure you let people know you were aware that it wasn't a real movie - if you say you didn't like 'Jackass' and don't say you knew it wasn't a movie, that makes you an idiot in the eyes of the demented people who enjoy this stuff.The execs at Viacom are the ones who are really laughing here, spending a paltry five million dollars to make this piece of crap. Perhaps we'll see Johnny Knoxville tightrope walking over a pit full of DVD copies of the film in 'Jackass: The Movie II'. Who knows? That would be funny.</fullReview>

There are some funny bits but basically, it's just a bunch of drunken frat boys with too much money and too much time on their hands. Don't get me wrong, it's humorous, sure, but I don't need to see that much puke or human excrement ever.

		<shortDescription>The ultimatum in chaotic/self-destructive comic film-making</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(possible spoilers)Jackass the television show, on MTV, is a funny show since it's players (or as they call themselves stuntmen, since these are stunts to the X degree) are like live action versions of cartoons, such as Looney Tunes and Beavis and Butt-head, only here they get a camcorder and while one or two or more of the guys does the scene, all the others laugh hysterically; there are moments when Wile E. Coyote comes to mind when looking at Johnny Knoxville for example. However, the scenes in this movie are like none I have ever seen before in a film, which in a sense makes this part of the history cinema- it's truly the first reality movie, with no plot whatsoever, and each scene somehow trying to top the next (with Steve-O taking the prize for the balsiest scenes). For those wondering, if they haven't watched the television show, if they want to see this in the theaters, should know that the term "not for all tastes" is a broad one here. There are acts most professional stuntmen in Hollywood wouldn't do for millions of dollars that are executed by deep down dumb-s*** for very little spending dough. There are acts that involve carnivorous animals, old dudes on scooters, bowel movements, and so on. And the reason it didn't get any critic sceenings is because Paramount knows that the movie would get panned worse than Freddie Got Fingered, and a good lot of them would think they have deathwishes. I don't think so (and I try to see as many movies as is around); these apples may not be the brightest of the bunch in the human gene pool, yet when it comes down to it, to most people who have a wide and truly crude sense of humor, this movie is be a laugh riot. It will gross out many, but it certainly has more guts and comic effect than any other picture you may ever see. One more note; yes, that IS Spike Jonze (who was one of the producers) as one of the old men. B+</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nor big or clever at all but for all its pointlessness it is actually sporadically funny stuff</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As in the MTV show of the same name, Johnny Knoxville leads his group of friends in a series of stunts that involve hurting one another, confusing the public or just causing a nuisance. So the intrepid band of Bam, Steve-O, Wee-Man, Chris, Ryan and others engaging in stunts that include baiting alligators, putting children's toys up their bums, crashing golf carts, falling off skateboards, shaving each other's heads and getting tattoo's in the back of a vehicle while Henry Rollins of The Rollins Band offroads it.If you are the type of person who uses the phrase "hell in a handcart" on a fairly regular basis then you should probably avoid this film as it is only going to confirm your worst fears about youth, television, entertainment and society in general. I'm not really that type of person but even I have to admit that it is hard to watch this film without thinking about the type of people (and there are loads of them) that will watch this and then go and imitate it. Of course pretty much everything shown in the film is puerile and isn't right to do to others or yourself ? it does show a lack of respect for others to sh1t in a display toilet for example. Of course the film has the benefit that we all know those involved signed waivers afterwards, had everything put right and were probably well paid for being good sports. This makes the public stunts a bit easier to enjoy even if some of them are in very bad taste. They are generally a lot more mean spirited and childish than the similar and better Trigger Happy TV but it is hard to ignore that some of them are very funny.Of course there are also plenty of gross moments whose appeal will depend on your humour but I'm guessing you know whether or not you are target audience or not. Personally I didn't need close ups of boxer shorts and toilets full of sh1t and does anyone like to watch another person vomit? None of it is big nor clever of course but then why should I waste my time and yours telling you this? Did any viewer come to this film expecting more then they got? It is quite critic proof I suppose because there isn't a great deal of point in criticising for operating at a low level of humour because that is exactly where it wants to be. The "cast" are all pretty hard to dislike from a distance but I cannot imagine ever wanting to meet them or have to deal with them in real life.Pointless, puerile, tasteless, gross and occasionally quite imaginative target audience will love it for its mix of stunts. For the love of God please don't try to do any of this yourself but if you can ignore the social impact of such stuff then some of it is surprisingly funny and easy to watch (albeit with your mouth open or eyes closed).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Swings back and forth between genuinely funny, victimless pranks (the golf cart race and chase, the boxing in the department store, truck roller disco) and idiotic, hateful mischief-making that leaves some poor slob cleaning up after them.Take, for instance, the bit in which they go to a hardware store and one of the 'Jackasses' defecates in a display toilet. Read that sentence again. This in an actual scene from this film. Anyway, the guy defecates in a display toilet. Ho-ho. Now, why don't they show the guy who works two jobs to feed his family cleaning this targeted toilet out after they've left? I mean, the same mean-spirited morons who would laugh at the defecating would probably get a big kick out of the working-class schmuck scooping it out.I think the recommendation on this movie is IQ based. If your IQ is sub-normal or you are retarded, you'll love this film: A+. If your IQ is in the normal range, you'll love some things and hate others: C. If you are a very bright person, you'll hate this whole thing: F.Things to look for: Butterbean bashes brain-dead ringleader, roller disco.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Absolutely fascinating--an easy contender for the Worst Film of All Time. Johnny Knoxville and his sick friends perform disgusting, dangerous stunts on themselves and others. POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD!!!The "highlights" include a man going to a plumbing store and doing his business in one of their toilets (and we see what he leaves in the bowl); a man urinating on a snow cone and then eating it; a man sniffing Chinese food up his nose and then vomiting; the guys use electric shock on various body parts; a man lets a baby alligator bite his nipple while he screams in pain and a man sticking a small toy car up his butt all the way in!!!!!All these stunts have the other guys watching and laughing hysterically. What the hell is so funny watching a guy eat his own urine or vomiting all over? This movie's idea of humor is watching people in pain or being humiliated. There's no plot. In a way, this is fascinating--if only for how infantile and disgusting a film can get. How did this get an R rating--it's NC-17 all the way. The only thing that kept me watching was the guys. Knoxville and some of his pals are actually quite attractive, have loads of charisma and are out of their clothes a lot (there's a huge amount of male nudity). So, in the end, I hated this film but it has an audience. Many people in the theatre were laughing loudly while I just sat there appalled. It's already a big hit too which is really sad. So, it depends on what you find funny. It will, with no doubt, wow all the teenage boys in the audience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am a fan of some gross out humor, but when it is so sick it makes me feel nauseated, I could do without seeing it. I liked The Tom Green show, which is what Jackass reminds me of. And I watched Jackass some too on MTV. Many of the skits are funny in a gross way, but the ones where it shows guys puking were too much. I didn't need to see that. It was making me sick. And one thing I don't get is in the disclaimer it says professional stunt men are doing this. Who are these professionals because those guys look nothing like a bunch of crazy goof balls.FINAL VERDICT: If you liked the TV show, then I'm sure you'll want to check this out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was VERY dumb. Can anything be dumber than the guys from this movie? I don't think so. And I ask myself, "why do I find it interesting to watch dumb people doing stupid things?" Because it's funny ! But it is not an average funny, it's a different, very different kind of funny. And I believe it works because they are the only ones doing this kind of stuff in the movie/TV business. We ought to recognize that they (the Jackass crew) broke a barrier. They crossed the other side...and nothing happened to them! It's like real-life Beavis and Butthead experience. Rest assured that whoever is planning to watch this is going to a experience some thrills and chill! There are moments in witch you are going to be like "Oh gross!" and other moments that you will be thinking "How come I never thought of doing that when I was a kid?" This said, I can assure you this: "Jackass:The Movie" is entertaining ...and cool!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's Jackass, What did You Expect?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hi, I'm WillyT and welcome to the review of Jackass. If you expect an Oscar winning story than you clearly don't know the point of Jackass. Jackass is a bunch of guys who pull pranks and do stunts for comedy. They do really good and it's really funny. There were points in this movie where I'm like "they did not just do that." Knoxville, Bam, Steve- 0, Danger Ehren, Dave England, Ryan Dunn, Wee man, and Preston Lacy are all the members of the Jackass squad and how they still walk I will never know.Everyone knows this is a popular show on MTV and I was a bit worried I would be a little bored with watching it for an hour and a half. By the end I was not bored at all I could have watched another hour. This movie had some really funny scenes. Ryan Dunn puts the toy car up his ass and gets x-rays. The doctors' reaction was hilarious and made the movie just that much better. Steve-O tight roped across a pool of alligators, crazy. They dressed up as old people and caused anarchy. Bam had an electric scooter and rolled down a hill yelling out for help because his brakes failed. People literally were chasing him down the road to help and it was just awesome. Jackass has these moments where you and your friends will never forget and will talk about for a very long time. Some of the stunts made no sense at all like the rockets skates and the super wedgies but they were still funny. It was sort of like it's so stupid it just might work. It worked but for the wrong reason. It didn't work at all but it was still incredibly funny so it worked.My favorite stunt was when Dave England was going to poop in a toilet in a hardware store. This store sold toilets and this one was not hooked up it was being sold in public and he planned on pooping in it and leaving. MTV has to do something with businesses because half of the stunts are totally illegal, but I'll get to that later. On the way to the hardware store Dave England really has to poop and he ends up pooping his pants on the way. That is almost funnier than the actual stunt himself. It smells, its gross, but it's hilarious. Everyone got a laugh out of it, the crew even threw up and they got it on camera. Amazingly later on the same day he goes into the store, poops and then leaves leaving the customers shocked and disgusted. I was laughing so hard I missed the next stunt completely. Jackass the TV show has Bam beating up and torturing his parents. The movie does this to, they stick to their roots. Bam puts firecrackers in Phil's car and bedroom, Bam beats him up while he is on the toilet, Bam even scared his mother with a live alligator in the kitchen. It was classic Jackass and the movie stuck to what it does best and I think fans really appreciated that.Sure I love this movie but it was far from perfect. They do so much stuff that is just illegal I don't even know how they got away with it. The first stunt of the movie had Knoxville renting a car and then demolishing it and refusing to pay for it. MTV obviously did something about it and paid for it but it's just unreal. The original Jackass was stunts any idiot can do but it would just be stupid to do them. Now they are just doing it for TV and it makes it a little less fun. Jackass is definitely funnier, but less fun and unrealistic. It wasn't a huge deal because the whole movie wasn't like that, it was a fair mixture. Another problem is the warning in the beginning. Obviously a warning is necessary but I had a problem with calling them "professionals." These guys are not professionals. A professional does not put a muscle stimulator on his balls. Just call them idiots who are getting paid and that will still get the message across. Overall Jackass does what Jackass does best and that is make people laugh. They didn't sellout, they did what they wanted. Was it perfect? No, but it was awesome. This movie gets 7 out of 10 and the WillyT seal of approval.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Everyone's Preference.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of those films where people will either love it or hate it, I love it. It's not a good film to review simply because it really cannot be classified as a cinematic film. It's a social film, social in the sense that you can watch it with a bunch of friends and laugh and forget about the world for a few hours to just laugh at sheer stupidity.Jackass the Movie is sheer stupidity but it's not a bad film. It's always nice seeing a bunch of close friends laugh with each other despite risking their lives in the most ludicrous ways whilst doing so. I can't imagine many people over the age of 40 liking this film because it can be extremely vulgar in some parts and quite gruesome in others. For younger people it's seeing people do things that you wouldn't dare do plus some things you've always wanted to do. There are some genuine laugh-out-loud moments in this film which is why I love it so much. The layout of the film is very simple but very effective, the music used can even add extra humour to some parts which shows that despite the content of this film being silly, these guys do know a thing or two about film. I would recommend this film if you're not wanting cinematic awe, if you're just wanting a laugh, plain and simple. Do not watch this film if you do not have a strong stomach or do not approve of unnecessary vulgarity.</fullReview>

Then watch this movie.The movie crude, rude, hilarious. Every scene in the movie these guys put their lives on the line in order to make us laugh. Now, that is comedy!

'Jackass: The Movie' is 85 minutes long, and this reality film, offers some truly risky stunts, some nudity and embarrassing moments. Johnny Knoxville leads the bandwagon and also does some stunts sportingly.There is a particular gag, named as Butt X-Ray, where Ryan Dunn, one of the stars of this hit-flick, 'inserts a toy car wrapped in a condom into rectum and getting X-rays of the car inside his anus'! Do I need to say anything more? This flick is dangerous, funny &amp; completely absurd!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jackass is one of the coolest and at the same time, grossest thing I've ever seen. I can't even believe that people are capable of taking so much pain. And the actors and stunt-men are still fine nowadays. Yep, they all look cool and pretty much crazy while doing stunts. The creativity and craziness of each stunt is on the top level. I'm a daredevil myself, Jumping staircases on the 3rd floor with the possibility that you may fall to the ground floor, Drinking some Zonrox and rat poisons, Eating raw meat, Every crazy kid that can imagine. I thought I was a bad ass around here, Until I saw this film, I'm like "Are they okay?", "Holy s**t", "yuck!" They're from another world. They're on a whole new level, I'm just a noob.If you enjoy pulling pranks in your elementary days, if you're a little sadistic and can't stop yourself laughing when someone gets hurt a little, if you want to see how much agony a body can take, then this film is perfect for you. This is complete original, a very different experience of your life.For those faint-hearted and those people who enjoys dramas and realistic movies, then after seeing it he/she cries about on how nonsense is it, who's fault really is it? Who in the hell will go to movies, rent some CD entitled "Jackass" if you're that kind of person?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jackass: The Movie might just be the best film ever made. Hear me out. Forget about aesthetics or narrative, if one were to measure a movie's success purely by second-for-second entertainment value, then Johnny Knoxville and Co win hands - and trousers - down. This is a film, after all, where a man places a toy car in a condom and buries it in his rectum (then visits a radiologist complaining of bowel pains). Another clamps baby alligators on his nipples. Another, very simply, just poos himself. For laffs. To essentially stimulate the part of the brain that lights up when John Belushi crushes a beer can on his head in Animal House. Taken together with the sequel, it's around 3 hours of deranged brilliance you should never attempt at home. Anti-PC power: They're only hurting themselves, so oddly low.Vicar-baiting potential: 80. Scat-factor: Deep red.Blasphemy/sacrilege/profanity: Oh, a lot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Knoxville and the boys go off their trolley in this big screen outing.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's bizarre for me to recollect now how I first ended up viewing Jackass: The Movie. It was a random selection at the cinema on one of those days when I just felt like catching a movie with my partner and that was the next available film. I thought I may enjoy some of it but I was also suspecting I may hate it because I had never, at that point, even seen the series on MTV. Never.What followed was 80-90 minutes of the funniest material I have ever seen in the cinema. Seriously, I have never outright belly-laughed so much in a cinema in my entire life. While many have claimed this release is the nadir of modern comedy movies I would have to strongly disagree and know that many others feels the same way as I do.Yes, everything here is immature, stupid and damned reckless at times but it's also (for the most part) all done with an endearing childish naivet that makes those involved hard to dislike. The movie also does very well in letting you get to know these characters and, while there is no set storyline, I must say that I went into things as a complete ignoramus and came out having a great affection for Johnny Knoxville, "Party Boy" and the rest of the bunch.Basically, it does exactly what it sets out to do and even though it sets out to have fun with skateboards, fat suits, old-aged makeup, pain, nasty substances and fake pandas . . . . . it's a resounding success.See this if you like: "Jackass", Dirty Sanchez: The Movie, Jackass Number Two.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ah yes, this takes me back. Many years ago, back in 2001 me and my mates used to watch Jackass sacrilegiously. We would bring in our snacks and drinks, snuggle down on our beanbags and corners, turn the lights down and watch each episode with satanic reverence. Such a show had never been seen, such power and wisdom never portrayed on screen. For a time these men became our idols: Johnny Knockville, Steve-Uh, Panty Boy, Bam Margaret, Presto, Little Man, Danger Eric, Ryan Dumb, Dave Englund etc et all. Every single stunt and sketch they performed for us filled our bellies with merriment and our hearts with warmth. We laughed, we screamed, we soiled each others' pants. It soon became apparent that it was our lot in life to copy and then improve on these acts ourselves, and eventually create our own earth shattering tricks and treats to perform for the masses and in turn earn ourselves millions! Yes, this is the story of my own misspent youth: Jerkass: The Movie: We split ourselves up into roughly two categories: Those who wanted to attempt the stunts, the things which may involve being hurt physically or being sick mentally, and those who could do the funny stuff like pretending your baby has just been crushed by a 10 tonne truck, you know the stuff that involved acting. We started off small, jumping across fences and posts on skateboards naked, moving up to diving over cars on a skateboard with one wheel dressed as Freddie Mercury. Eventually we were doing amazing things that Evil Ken Evil would have been proud of: balancing on a unicycle on one finger while hopping between the roofs of moving race cars which were driven by grizzly bears. Of course we employed rat traps, snooker cues, hatchets, tramps, and of course staples. One highlight was a game of tag we played in a rented function room in our local leisure centre. Instead of tagging with our hands, we used cattle prods. Within 12 minutes we were rolling on the floor, covered in mess skating and crying for our mothers; they never came. When we recovered 2 hours later, we all picked on our version of Little Man- Bernard. We each stuck him with our prods from behind, from on top, in his leg, in his stomach, in his special area over and over and over. The results are stunning. I particularly liked the way he ran down the corridor, stripping off his clothes to reveal his burning skin, spillings and devastation dripping everywhere. He bursts through to the children's' paddling pool, slips onto his back and proceeds to slide into the water which eventually turns a wrong colour. Genius.Another trick was dressing up as policemen and driving to various houses. When someone came to the door we would inform them that their husband/wife/children had been murdered and record the hilarious results. Sometimes we would hide in post boxes and when someone put a letter in we would jab them with a rusty needle. Once on a golf course we hired a truck and trailer, and drove up the 18th fairway with a bouncy castle on the trailer filled with local miscreants let out of the asylum for a day. Even better was when the wind suddenly changed and they decided to go on a rampage through the grounds of the golf club, chasing grannies with a 9 iron, and pretending the real swans in the lake were plastic paddle boats. Unfortunately the public did not find many of these japes particularly amusing and as a result we were reported to the local constable. Soon we were remanded in custody and our tapes and equipment seized. Most of us were given community service and had to work on a farm, clean up dirty swimming pools, or help feed the crazies at the asylum before midnight. I got off light because I pretended to be from Lithuania. Jackass: The Movie Film went further than the series. We went further still.Best Scene: When Dave makes a toilet (loady) in the local hardware store even though it doesn't flush. He stole that idea from me. Speaking of which, I'm busting right now?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An under- rated film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>All films have a target audience, some are family films, while others are for adults. This is quite clearly a film aimed at teens. For a start, the series was on MTV, another piece of media that has teenagers as its target audience. Secondly you can see from the trailers, and the name of the film, that it will be filled with gross and ridiculous stunts, which I can't imagine many 'mature' adult's will enjoy. So what surprises me is that people who are 30+ have rated this film as 'bad', eg. below 4-5 stars.I really don't know what they were expecting, they had all the warning right under their noses, and all they could say about the movie is the it was 'vile','... piece of crap, Digusting, distasteful' to quote but a few.If you don't find that kind of thing funny, why go watch it!?Now the important bit, what was 'Jackass' trying to do? It is a slapstick comedy based on gross, immature, silly and usually dangerous stunts, and so it is trying to make you laugh and feel disgusted.Does it do this well? Well, we can quite easily see that many people have been disgusted by it, though not everyone finds it funny. Then again this is has a very selective target audience, and we can see that from the vote statistics that the highest rating come from those under 18; the target audience. I am also in that target audience, and enjoyed it immensely, and so I have to say it is a success.In conclusion, this film is for those who can laugh at others misfortune, and though's with a strong stomach (though it is not totally necessary, me being a prime example).If you have nether of these...THEN DON'T WATCH THE FILM!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>MTV stands for Music Television. How does mind boggling stupidity fit in there? Well, no matter what, their hit show Jackass is quite the spectacle. With crazy and most of the time idiotic stunts and pranks, the show gave kids the answer to 'what happens when you do this?' Althoguh the disclaimer at the opening of the show featuring a bandaged skull and cross-crutches saying to not try this at home and these are "trained professionals", some of the things they do really do seem like fun whether it is kayaking in a fountain or racing in shopping carts...with armor.Jackass: The Movie is one of the sickest, hilarious, and dumbfounding 87 minutes ever seen. Starring Johnny Knoxville, Steve-O, Bam Margera, Chris Pontius, Adam Dunn, Jason "Wee Man" Acuna, and a host of other daredevils, these "professionals" showcase their skills all over the world. They go from running around in panda suits through the streets of Tokyo to dangling chicken over alligators at a zoo. These "brave" souls give it their all to make us keel over in laughter and at the same time say, "Why would you do that?"What this movie lacks is sanity. Shoving a toy car up ones anus is not the smartest thing to do, let alone walk around with it and get an x-ray just to see what the doctor has to say. Getting a tattoo while on an off-road vehicle isn't that bright of an idea either. What they do show is that no matter how idiotic they may be, we're still watching them and giving them money to see it. Mind you, this movie isn't for those with weak stomachs. I myself found myself nauseous. These guys just never seemed to listen to their parents warnings.If you enjoy this film, watch Viva La Bam on MTV to see more crazy stunts and stupid ideas, just revolving around Bam, his family, and some "Jackasses". Overall, this movie is worth at least one viewing. The deleted scenes are also a must-see. Not every stunt or skit is for everyone but there is something to make you laugh hard. Jackass: The Movie has everything you want except common sense.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of the very few movies that actually made me laugh out loud.Please don't expect a story with characters and plot lines just because the title is "Jackass: The Movie", it's is nothing more then an extended "Jackass" episode with more dangerous and crazy daring stunts and silly situations. But what great fun it is!Maybe the best thing about the movie is that you can really see that the guys had lot's of fun making it. I always enjoy movies in which you can see that they had lot's of fun while making it. Of course I don't like every bit of the movie. For instance I don't like the scene's in which they hurt them selves on purpose by cutting them selves with paper or when they let an baby alligator bite them, but that is just a matter of taste. Luckily the other parts of the movie makes this up, it is absolutely hilarious! Especially the scene's in Japan are crazy as well as hilarious. However it's not a movie that you watch over and over again, after 2 or 3 times you already have seen it all.All in all I can highly recommend this movie to everyone who likes the crazy "Jackass" humor, if you don't like the show then simply don't watch this movie because changes are you will probably hate this movie as well.If you liked the show, you will love the movie.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very well done...and chalk full of jackasses to boot!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I review a movie, I must first consider what the movie is intended to be and represented to be. Some can take a Titanic sized budget, Hollywood names, and a best selling screen writer and make a mediocre movie at best. For me, a movie like that gets a 2/10 stars. The same movie made with a mediocre budget, fairly unknown performers, and an unknown writer...and I'll give it a 5/10 stars. This movie is exactly what it presents itself as. Hence, its clever title. It is chalk full of dangerous, disgusting, and bizarre stunts. I nearly vomited three times during the movie. I laughed my jackass off. I repeatedly exclaimed "oh my god" like an idiotic teenage girl.A great film. My mom even liked it. My favorite scene (which I feel sums up the whole spirit of Jackass) was when one of the performers flung himself into a ceiling fan. It's a collage of the spontaneous and indiotic things some of us ocassionally consider doing, but never do. This film is an inspiration to jackasses all over the world. I give 8/10 stars. Had it been a whole new idea, not based on a show, and not marketed solely towards teen-aged asswipes, I might have given it 10/10. But there it is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I can't wait for The Version You Couldn't See In Theaters!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw Jackass: The Movie on its opening night. I don't know why. Maybe because I'm a college student and have lots of friends who are still into goofy high school movies like this. I think I saw Half Baked on opening night for the same reason, although that time I had the excuse of really being in high school. I can already see the masses of responses to the sickening childishness of this movie, the pointlessness, the fact that there's no plot, it's little more than a longer version of the TV show and with stunts so dangerous or disgusting or immoral that they couldn't be shown on television. These things are all true, of course, but the movie deserves at least a blunt form of respect. Johnny Knoxville was able, for example, to get a contract signed to actually make his disgusting, immoral, childish, plotless TV show into a movie. Just the fact that the movie was made at all shows that there has to be some kind of filmmaking talent involved in its creation, even if that talent is entirely in the business area.Besides that, there can be no doubt that the movie is entertaining and amusing, even if it is on the level of fourth grade humor. Some of the stunts were just sickening and unpleasant, such as the snow cone scene and anything involving anal excretions (or insertions), and this does, of course, include the abysmally moronic scene where the old fat man takes a beating while sitting on the toilet. It's so obvious that they were running out of ideas here that that's almost funny in itself.However, some of the scenes really were creative and funny. My personal favorite, of course, is the one with the naked fat man carrying the gong. Here's this great big fat guy wearing nothing but a diaper, and he's holding onto a gong with both hands. He walks up behind some unsuspecting citizens, and Johnny smacks the gong and then runs away, leaving the fat guy to stand there and bow and the people to look at him in shock. I just about fell out of my chair laughing at this, because if I was one of those people and I turned around and saw this naked fat guy holding a gong with two hands, the only thing that I would be able to think is, `What the hell did he just hit that gong with?!'</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not really a movie since it lacks standard movie elemants like direction and a plot, but if you have 80 minutes to kill this should do the trick. So called movie follows the antics of Johnny Knockxville and his gang of demanted friends who perform some rather dangerous and gross stunts. There will be plenty of times where you will find yourself squirming or thanking your about ready to throw up (the snowcone scene nearly caused me to throw up), but at other times you will nearly be falling out of your seat from laughter. Only reason this doesn't rate 4 stars is because nothing in this film is able to top the final stunt in the Steve-O video in terms of grossness. It also pushes the R-rating to the limits and you will never look at Hot Wheels car or hardware store the same again.Rated R; Nudity, Profanity, and Extreme Crude Stunts.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't care if this movie isn't a cinematic masterpiece--it's hilarious and that's all that matters. Everyone must see this movie because it will be the best hour of your life. You will never stop laughing and you will never be more entertained by anything, ever. GO SEE IT!!! I just want to thank the guys who made this movie because I haven't had that much fun at a movie theatre for awhile.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The greatest movie of all time!!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>People who intend to see this film better realize one thing: Make sure you have your sense of humor with you or else you're better off staying home.This movie is crude, gross, asinine, silly, foul, disgusting, and has no redeeming qualities whatsoever. Consequently, it is funnier than 95 percent of the comedies that come out each and every year, funnier than any Pauly Shore, Carrot Top, or Rob Schneider film that has ever been made, funnier than a good portion of the television series.I loved this film. I loved it so much, I am insisting on a four hour director's cut for the DVD. I am insisting on Son of Jackass. I hope this movie cracks $100 million too.I recommend this film to all who aren't uptight, highbrow oriented folk.9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Boring kids stuff</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In "Jackass the Movie" the camera follows a cadre of wacky young men, the jackasses, around as they do such silly stunts as urinating in a snow cone, eating it, and then barfing it up. A bit of a sham, the camera spends too much time on the jackasses as opposed to the bystanders whose faces are often blanked out and whose expression may have been priceless. The jackasses also find it too easy to work themselves into a hysterical frenzy....hey, they're the stars right? But do we care how funny -they- think -they- are? Also, many of the gags don't make the trip across the lens, such as shocking each other. How do we know how shocked they are except to watch more of the jackasses hysterical frenzy? In spite of all that and more, MTV does know their market. So, "Jackass: The Movie" must have appeal for the young, naive, and immature. Elders might want to try something more sophisticated such as Allen Funt's "What Do You Say to a Naked Lady?". (D)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a good funny movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I found this movie to be a good and funny movie. It stars Johnny Knoxville, Bam Margera, Ehren McGehey, Dave England, Steve-O, Chris Pontius, and others. This movie is one that you could watch 10 times and still be amused by it. For the most part, the stunts are dangerous and sometimes weird and unnecessary, but for some reason it's hard to turn away from watching them. I still don't know how they didn't get seriously injured from the stunts performed. A scene that I definitely think proves that they're Jackasses is the scene where Ehren takes snow, puts it on a cone, pees on it, and eats it. It's disgusting and hard to watch, but I still loved this movie. The stunts and scenes are basically just like the ones in the show Jackass, but just taken to a farther, more extreme level. Uptight movie-goers will probably hate this movie, but it's definitely entertaining and people who love the show will most likely love the movie. If you're looking for a good real-life comedy, then see this movie. Jackass:The Movie is a good movie that takes full advantage of the R rating.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The funniest film of 2002</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This hilarious big-screen version of the hit MTV reality series which ran from 2000 to 2002 is one of the most outrageous motion pictures one is likely to ever see. There are scenes of objects being shoved up a man's anus, vomiting, yellow snow cone eating, and defecation, making it not recommendable for the easily grossed out. People who like gross stuff such as myself will love this movie. It's low-brow humor at its best. Highlighs include scenes with Party Boy, the aforementioned yellow snow cone eating scene, the scene where Wee Man kicks himself in the head, and the blow horn scene. Not all of the sketches work. The paper cut one was really disgusting and the Son of Jackass sketch that plays after the end credits was pointless. Still, it's amazing how many of sketches do work. One would expect a "Jackass" movie to be hit-and-miss. JACKASS: THE MOVIE hits 95% of the time. 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Q&amp;A about Jackass</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Someone asked why Johnny mentioned that "it's too bad that Brandon DiCamillo isn't in the movie more often", and then Dimitry and Jeff are silent. It's because Brandon only participated in skits that were filmed in Pennsylvania. For his own reasons, he decided not to go with the rest of the guys (and of course, nobody wanted to say anything bad about Brandon's decision during the film).As for some of the haters of this movie - get a life! This is clearly a movie you'll either love or hate (and you'll know where you fall into that category within 10 minutes of watching this movie), but don't talk down to people who love this movie. We love this movie because the stunts and skits are dumb - but they're meant as pranks, as opposed to anything mean- spirited (something most imitators don't seem to be able to get). That, plus these guys clearly have a good time having fun with each other, and it feels almost like you could walk over to them and hang out with them (another thing most imitators don't seem to understand).If you don't like this movie, that's fine - but people with intelligence can also find stuff to find funny in this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jackass: The Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>1 year ago I would have gave th movie a9 but I am now a recovering drug addict and alcoholic (3 months sober) and all I see is a bunch of drunken idiots who are trying to make money and sugarcoat the world of addiction. Our kids don't need any more of a push from society to hurt themselves emotionally and physically than is already out there. The money used to make this movie could have been used for a useful project such as "A Million Little Pieces" by James Frey. I hope the people in this movie have straightened themselves out by now but it took me from 12 yrs old to 44 to figure it out. Also being told I would die in 6 months and support from my wife and kids was the kicker. There's only 3 ways out change, jail, or DIE. All the best to the cast. Choose the right road for you. Movies affect our young. Help them don't hurt them. Life is short and nobody really wants to die. I want to be remembered for the good not the bad. E-mail comments to me at geawyer@hotmail.com I'm willing to look all the sides of the box.</fullReview>
