		<shortDescription>This is a great film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is no compulsory villain in this wonderfully animated film, no moral lessons, no standard blue print story, and the characters will definitely not break out in a song. Thank God! It's simply a great film for all ages. Don't mind if the soundtrack isn't dubbed to your native language, my kids (4 and 6 years old) could easily follow the story with just a few helpers. Japanese is a wonderful language. The film has great direction, beautiful backgrounds and a mystical, pleasant aura throughout. There's nothing like this, I promise you. It's idyllic, for the most part, but still with an exciting story that unfolds into something very unexpected.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A kids movie?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Picture if you will, a 27 year old male, scanning through his dvd collection, trying to figure out what to watch, on a boring night at home. Suddenly, he stops at My Neighbor Totoro and smiles. Well, that's a pretty typical happenning around the house here.Miyazaki created a true masterpiece with this film. It has everything a person, of any age, could want. There are points that it is hilarious, a few points where it makes one slightly nervous, the animation is outstanding (as with all Miyazaki films), and aside from lacking a little bit in plot (what movie doesn't nowadays?), the story is wonderful.One of the things that makes this film shine, at least for me, is that there is absolutely no antagonist role. No bad guy whatsoever, and only a genius like Miyazaki could pull that off.Is this a childrens movie? Yes, of course it is. Is it a movie only for children? Well... maybe for the inner child inside all of us. There's humour in this movie that the young will laugh at, and there's a bit of humour in the movie that only adults will fully catch and appreciate, without it being "adult humour".I would reccommend, and have reccommended this film to anyone that would listen.Thank you again Miyazaki Sensei.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The cutest movie I ever saw !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My favorite Miyazaki's movie is "Princess Mononoke" on a graphical scale. But on a "charming scale", this one is really the best.Even the Disney movies are not so charming than this movie. Poetic, charming, cute, I can't find the words to describe the good this movie made to me. Miyazaki brings us into the wonderlands of the children, better than "Alice in wonderland" or "Peter pan".In fact, Miyazaki makes us loving children. In the movie, the children run, shout all time, laugh, cry, and so on. In the real world, I hate this. In normal movies I hate this too. But, here, every actions of the two little girls touch us deep in our heart. We learn to love children's world.Every one of us will have a smile on this face, from the beginning to the end of this movie.My favorite scene is the first encounter between Mei and Totoro. It's fun, poetic, and charming. Miyazaki succeeds to make a movie enjoyable for the very little kids (4 y.o.) and for the adult audience. It's very rare to succeed doing that !Really, a masterpiece !10/10 !</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A delightful, touching, timeless classic!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the brilliant "Walt Disney of Japan", Hayao Miyazaki, comes a wonderful soothing film that everyone will simply embrace. Featuring stunning animation, endearing personable characters, and a heart-tugging storyline that's simple, enchanting, and even dramatic.Sometimes you feel like you're not watching an animated children's movie, because the characters (particularly the children) and the storyline seem so realistic. There's no bad guy, no song numbers, and no references to pop-culture. Most cartoons (especially Disney) feature these and it gets old and routine. Here we have a break from all of that and get a real masterpiece.Miraculously, Totoro doesn't talk, and yet you can still understand what the lovable furry creature is thinking with his endearing actions. And the six-legged CatBus is undeniably one of the most imaginative characters in animation history. And the human characters are also remarkable. Mei and Satsuki act like little girls, not like kids who are smarter than adults (a routine toons today are guilty of).I loved Totoro when I was a small child and I always will. When I have children of my own someday, I will show them Totoro instead of toy commercials like Dora and Elmo's world.BOTTOM LINE: A masterpiece... pure and simple.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is the movie I watch to restore my faith in humanity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first saw "My Neighbor Totoro" when I was maybe seven.At the time, I thought that it was really boring(that was still when I liked Disney movies). Years later, when I discovered "Princess Mononoke" I learned that MNT was by the same director and watched it again. And I find that I appreciate this film a whole lot more now then I did when I was seven.The animation is absolutely stunning(as with all Miyazaki films)and the story is deceptively simple, told with patient, subtle attention to detail. The best example IMO is the scene where Mei falls asleep on Totoro's stomach.It's fruitless to try and describe it;you have to see it for yourself.In closing, I would just like to say that I can't wait for a decent DVD to arrive so I can view this quiet masterpiece in widescreen in Japanese with subtitles.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The kind of film that stays with you afterwards...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first watched this film in Japanese with a 12 year old translating for me and I still thought it was incredible. There are so many wonderful touches, like a tin can in the stream while the kids are fascinated by a fish, or the flying scenes (I'm convinced that Ang Lee thought of Miyazaki when he made The Hulk, just in terms of the jumping scenes) that show a curious mind at work throughout the picture. I also love the sense of magic and innocence (and the lack of violence) which pervades the movie. It is a real antidote from the Disney formula which always involves a villain being trashed at the end. This is a film about the wonder of being a child and experiencing something incredible which adults can't see but recognize nonetheless. It works for any age as well. Enjoy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Totoro is a Winner</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Miyazaki's My Neighbor Totoro is a film that should be able to put a smile on any viewers face, and without a doubt, it'll take you on one of the most whimsical and fantastic journey's ever.My Neighbor Totoro is a story that definitely something children can relate with, as i watched this with someone, they immediately paused the film and asked if this reminded me of being 4 years old again. This film really connects with people. But it's far from a quality nostalgia piece, it's well animated, beautiful, avoids cliché stereotypes (from both typical of the Anime genre and Children's Fantasy films), and is beautifully filmed (see scenes such as the girls waiting for the bus with Totoro and the scene where the magic nuts and seeds grow with the help of Totoro).Even the English dub done by Fox isn't as bad everyone states. I've seen the Japanese version, and i'd have to say it's a mixed-bag between having Mei's voice sounds a bit too bratty for the English version, or having the Father's voice sound a bit awkward and perhaps not as caring in the Japanese version. Disney is said to be releasing a re-dub in mid-to-late 2005, so perhaps that will even out the controversy.This film may not reach the heights of other Anime classics (mainly it's double bill with Grave of the Fireflies, or Miyazaki's other masterpieces Princess Mononoke and Spirited Away), however this will definitely be high on any film lovers list, and is definitely a high water mark of it's genre.A solid 9/10, This film is next to impossible to watch without it pushing a smile out of your face.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A superb, uncynical journey into the imagination. Not so great dubbing, though.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie, set in Japan in the early fifties, is director Miyazaki's tribute to his mother (who suffered from tuberculosis, just like Satsuki and Mei's mother), his childhood home, and childhood innocence. Although some people who watch this movie wonder where the Americans are (this is post-WWII Japan, after all) and why so little screen time is spent on the girls' mother, but that may be partly due to the dubbing.Americans: First of all, the house the girls move into is rather European in design (with doorknobs, and an attic, and a front porch) despite the Japanese style bath and occasional sliding door. Secondly, Mei and Satsuki are really into Western fairy tales (the are brief glimpses of Japanese translations of The Three Billy Goats Gruff and other stories, along with Mei inadvertently re-enacting scenes from Alice in Wonderland and Chronicles of Narnia). On top of that, according to Helen McCarthy and other Miyazaki experts, the name "Totoro" is little Mei's mispronunciation of the Japanese transliteration of the English word "troll" ("tororo," which the Japanese would pronounce like "tololo" because they do not distinguish between r's and l's). This is why an accurate dubbed version is nearly impossible (like any little girl, Mei mispronounces a lot of words).The Mother: I think this movie is entirely about the mother. Throughout, you see them subtly (almost too subtly at times) change from completely carefree to terrified with each scene involving the mother. This parallels Satsuki's coming of age subplot (she's ten and like anyone that age she is self-conscious about believing in Santa, or in this case Totoro). There's a little bit of both in the culturally-shocking--though completely innocent--bath scene (both girls take a bath with their father during a wind storm).Really, though, My Neighbor Totoro is less about story than it is about the imagination of children.Although the animation is a little dated and a bit jerky at times, the direction is absolutely top notch. There is enough visual creativity to rival an average Hitchcock film (Miyazaki's a huge fan of Hitch: check out the long wait at the bus stop, which is reminiscent of North by Northwest). Highlights include a Mary Poppins-esque ride on an Oriental top, a beautifully animated storm, Mei's nap on the slowly rising and falling chest of the giant totoro, and a cat-bus complete with headlight eyes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderfully Magical!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like all Miyazaki films, this one is absolutely sacred. Some parts are reminiscent of Laputa: Castle in the Sky and Spirited Away (and Alice in Wonderland by extension), but Totoro stands out as probably the most unique of them all.The premise is nice and simple, which works brilliantly because the plot is established as a foundation without hindering the experience of the movie itself. The viewer is allowed unrestricted access and exploration of the messages offered by the film.In addition, Totoro is not bound by any rules of traditional storytelling. Instead, it presents occurrences that touch on a fundamental human level that is so deep and profound that it will have you feeling a range of emotions. There are so many layers to this movie, each one meaningful and special. From community building to the love of a family to sibling relationships to facing the unknown; everyone can take away something personal from this movie.Perhaps the most sacred aspect of the film, however, is that it reminds us that life is magical. Not all of us have a neighbor like Totoro, but we are all fortunate in different ways. Each of us has something to treasure, something that brings joy and comfort.Totoro is special in that it frees the viewer to be a child again and to contemplate the world through a perspective that we have perhaps forgotten. Everything is new and interesting and beautiful, from a crumbling porch to an acorn seed. We live in a magical world, and it is definitely worth taking the time to appreciate this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie is incredibly cute</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm a big fan of Hayao Miyazaki's work and was rather disappointed that this movie did not have the Japanese language/English subtitles option. But, I've finally seen it and must admit that it is incredibly cute. One does NOT have to be a child to enjoy this movie or any of Miyazaki's movies. The story line was good and and the characters were really touching. The totoros were so adorable that I want a plushie of one. I also loved the artwork. I finally know what some of the scenes are from in the AMVs that I've seen. I would definitely recommend this to families as well as to those who are Miyazaki fans. A definite thumbs up. Though I do wonder where Miyazaki gets some of the ideas for his characters such as that cat bus.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rare Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this movie when I was a kid, and while it never caught my attention as I do other commercial movies, I think it had a quiet and subtle effect on me over the years. Sometimes I think about that film, but I never knew why. So, after watching it again as an adult I realized why this movie stay within me: Totoro is a rare film that manages to capture the essence of a child's emotions and vision without being filtered through the adult's tendency to editorialize it, to insert a moral judgment, or to sugar coat it. Mei's behavior is naked, showing raw happiness as well as anger. Her movements are strong and her voice fierce, she thinks she lives in a world without limitations and not binded by adult's notion of etiquette. Satsuki is at a crossroads between adulthood and what remains of her innocence, we see her anxieties and we identify the world of the movie through her eyes. Totoro's physical characteristic is actually menacing and otherworldly, and our first impression of him (through the girls' eyes) is a natural mix of fear and amazement... the same reaction any human would have when confronting something foreign. But then something magical happens: Totoro moves and behaves just like Mei. We identify with this raw, pure energy of joy and imagination. That Studio Ghibli managed to express this idea visually, through character design, storytelling, and animation, is a rare and special accomplishment. This effect cannot be described during a script meeting with a committee of marketing execs.A typical American studio would be worried about presenting its main character as frightening, would redesign Totoro as a "cuter" character as a safe strategy, and would certainly make the father more of a one-dimensional, stereotypical "adult" character for dramatic purposes.But in this movie, we see the background story of the characters by deceptively simple closeup shot of the pebbles in the stream, or the details of the bathtub.But the most telling moment of the movie is actually early on: when the girls tried to push down the rotting wooden support of the house. At first only playing around, they then gave a serious effort to try to bring it down. But it doesn't fall. Seeing that the support stays, they simply move on. That establishes the tone and the world they inhabit: Life is unpredictable. Adults must learn to expect the worst to happen in order to deal daily with the real world. But the child has not yet fully learned this skill, so through their eyes, we see what we were, and what was important to us, long buried but not forgotten.Kids should see this movie as an alternative to the shallow mainstream entertainment. Whether they like it or not is irrelevant; its lasting impact is worth more that the toy of the month. Adults should see this movie to re-look at themselves and what they were, who they are now, and what they want to become. It doesn't preach anything, it's a simple story that you will enjoy when you can stop and have time for yourself and for the people you care about.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another miracle from Hayao Miyazaki</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I absolutely agree with Roger Ebert who called "My Neighbor Totoro", "One of the most beloved of all family films". Its colorfully bright and sparkling animation is enchanting. It is incredibly realistic and at the same time makes us along with two main characters, the young sisters ready for a miracle to happen any minute. The gentle story is touching, uplifting, funny, and tender without being overly sentimental or didactic. The film takes place in the early 50s, when 10-year-old Satsuki and her baby sister, curious and energetic 4-year-old Mei spend one summer in an old house in the country side with their University professor father while their mother recovers from a serious illness in the nearby hospital. The great master Hayao Miyazaki remembers well what it is like to be a child, to see magic in the everyday life and be always ready to encounter it. This ability usually disappears as the child becomes adult but it stays forever in a few chosen, and they become the visionary Artists - just like Miyazaki himself. The film is partially autobiographical for the writer/director/storyboard artist. "When Miyazaki and his brothers were children, his mother suffered from spinal tuberculosis for nine years, and spent much of her time hospitalized. It is implied, yet never revealed in the film, that Satsuki and Mei's mother also suffers from tuberculosis. He once said the film would have been too painful for him to make if the two protagonists were boys instead of girls." (From the IMDb film trivia)Totoro of the title is an adorable funny blue forest spirit who lives in the nest beneath a huge tree and makes the trees grow and the winds blow. Totoro becomes the friend and protector of the sisters and one day he sends them on the bus journey that is like nothing they and the viewers could ever imagine. I wish I could ride that cat bus. What a wild and kind imagination an artist should have to create it. How much happier we all are knowing that Hayao Miyazaki exists and makes his amazing films at the Studio Ghibli for which King Totoro is the mascot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A wonderful Miyazaki masterpiece in either version.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What more can be said about MY NEIGHBOR TOTORO? Get this movie. Immediately. Without a doubt one of the best animated features ever made, Japan or otherwise, TOTORO is an outstanding original creation from Hayao Miyazaki and Studio Ghibli. It's about two sisters -- Satsuki and spunky little Mei -- moving with their somewhat scatterbrained but loving father to a new home in the Japanese countryside. But the place isn't just deserted; wonders galore lie within their household. Tiny, fuzzy black balls of soot ("Soot Gremlins") scatter every nook and cranny of the walls, frightened away only by laughter. A tall, luscious camphor tree towers above the other trees in the back yard. And, lastly, the Totoros themselves, absolutely adorable little creatures who look like a cross between a raccoon, rabbit, owl, and guinea pig (a personal bias here, since I owned such a pet who reminds me so much of the Totoros here), live in this very forest, carrying acorns, making huge trees grow at night, and playing ocarinas on the branches of the trees. There is even one really BIG Totoro who sleeps under the tree, so cuddlesome and gentle that you'll swear that he's the equivalent of your pet. Of course, he doesn't just allow Mei to snuggle on his chest. He lets out thunderous roars, shake the ground by jumping with full force, grins as wide as a Cheshire cat (albeit with warmth and generosity), helps others when they're in trouble, and gives acorns wrapped in bamboo leaves in return for gifts. The story isn't all hearts and flowers, however. An emotionally charged subplot involving the sisters' ailing mother (shades of Miyazaki's personal life here) gives TOTORO a dramatic edge. This is particularly evident in the third act, when the girls receive a distressing telegram about their mother. Both Satsuki and Mei are extremely traumatized by this as any real child would be if such a situation occurred in their lifetime. What follows is a tearjerking sequence that builds to a truly happy ending. This mixture of real-life situations, emotions, and magical discoveries found in your nearest back yard make TOTORO feel authentic (even with its fantasy elements). One cannot help but find this quality in any of Miyazaki's films, this one included. MY NEIGHBOR TOTORO was not a box office success in either Japan or America, but the film has won over millions of children around the world as well as animation buffs for its gorgeous animation style; the backgrounds are lavishly detailed and imagination is galore in much of the sequences. (It was KIKI'S DELIVERY SERVICE that would catapult Miyazaki's animation company, Studio Ghibli, into box office success status.) The movie was originally dubbed into English by Carl Macek and his infamous company, Streamline Pictures in 1993. Believe it or not, this was one of the "best" dubs they've ever produced. As Disney has acquired the rights for Ghibli's movies, though, it was inevitable that they would produce their own version. This has infuriated many, but as someone who fell in love with TOTORO with the Mecak version, I have to say that this new Disney production offers charm and emotion on its own ground. The script is a fresh new translation from the original Japanese (clarifying the origin of Totoro's name), and remains faithful to the meaning of Miyazaki's screenplay, despite a few line changes here and there (nothing major, though). At first, I was a little worried about hearing Dakota and Elle Fanning as Satsuki and Mei, but both ended up captivating me from the start; personally, I think it was great for Disney to cast two actual sisters to play the young girls--it helps their chemistry come alive. The other actors, including a warm, understated Tim Daly, and delightful Lea Salonga provide similarly top quality work. My favorite performances? Pat Carroll, displaying maternal charm and whimsy as Granny (not sounding anything like her most-famous role, Ursula from THE LITTLE MERMAID), and Frank Welker, who does outstanding vocal foley for both Totoro and the Cat Bus. The OP and ED songs have the same lyrics, but are sung by a different singer (Sonya Isaacs), who may please some and annoy others. I'm sure that there will be many who will draw comparisons between the two dubs to the very bitter end, but I think it's great to have more than one adaptation of a beloved story, especially when done by folks who obviously love Miyazaki's works.As far as the long awaited 2-DVD set from Disney goes, the widescreen visual transfer is absolutely gorgeous--Miyazaki's visuals really shine with pristine clarity on the screen, and the Japanese language track features literal subtitles, too. The extras are the same-old voice talent featurette, storyboards, and trailer we saw on most of the other Disney-Ghibli DVDs, which is sparse to say the least, but better than nothing.Folks who want the old dub will obviously flock to the FOX pan &amp; scan DVD, but personally, I'd suggest getting both the FOX and Disney releases--the former for nostalgia, the latter for a more professional sounding upgrade. Either way, however, MY NEIGHBOR TOTORO is far from just another kid's story. With a little bit of luck, grown-ups (and those who consider themselves too "sophisticated" for cartoons) will enjoy it too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Delightful Children's movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What can I say ? It's a really endearing movie, and even though it's a children's movie, I found myself captivated. The story is about two children, who move to the village with their father. They come into contact with various lovable spirits/ghosts.Before watching various Miyazaki movies, my view of Japanese animation was that it was mostly full of violent animated serials, with a smear of science fiction. Seen them one, seen them all. I know that most people love to watch these type of animations. But I've never really been a big fan of these. One exception being "Final Fantasy - The Spirits Within".I watched this movie, because it was directed by Hayao Miyazaki. I had already seen "Sen to Chihiro No Kamikakushi" and " Neko No Ongaeshi" (thanks to these being rated in the top 250 on IMDb) and found it to be a wonderful movie. The same applies to this movie.The animation is stunning, even though it was done in 1988. I guess that's because since the entire animation is hand drawn, it doesn't get much better than this.The story is captivating, and keeps one wondering as to what will happen. I have a 2 year old niece, and when I watched the children in this movie, I was constantly thinking of how well the director has gotten into the skin of children. Their various facial expressions, cries and antics are uncanny. Many of the scenes are just magical, and I was really amazed at the creative imagination of the director and animators. Even the title song is very hummable.After watching these movies, I have now realized that the best Japanese animation is not the type that is shown on "Cartoon Network".A must-watch movie for all children, and adults too!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The most charming film I have EVER seen!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is intended for small children, so Miyazaki says. I was thirty-six when I watched it. I was so charmed that I showed it again to my father, who was then seventy-seven. He was so charmed that he insisted we must show it to his grandson, who is four. I have seen more exciting films, or funnier films, but none which gave me more sheer delight. It is a great shame the world isn't really as nice as this, but when you are four, like Mei, or even eleven, like Satsuki, this is how you want it to be: everyone bigger is kind and can be trusted completely, and everything always comes right in the end. Knowing a little boy of Mei's age I can vouch for her being highly realistic, from the obsessive looking through a hole in a bucket to the scowling and sulking! The most touching moment is when Catbus' destination board changes to "MEI", showing Satsuki that he knows exactly where her little sister is, and that he's going to take her straight there. My only criticisms, if you can call them that, are that the DVD doesn't contain the legendary sequel "Mei and the Kittenbus", in which Mei meets and goes for a ride with Catbus's little son, and that I can't ride in Catbus myself. As a cat lover and occasional bus user I feel I was born to do that, and it's a disgrace he's only imaginary!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An insightful and imaginative film that was incredibly cute</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After watching this film i was so overwhelmed by happiness and i just marvelled at the cuteness of it all. Totoro is beautifully drawn timeless touching, adorable film which will just enlighten you, regardless of age. I've seen this movie around, say, 8 times? I've watched it every year since i was 4 and it's the kind of movie that just puts this massive smile on your face.The protagonists are sisters Satsuki and Mei. They have just moved from the city with their father into the countryside while he writes a book and their mother is suffering from an unknown disease in a hospital nearby. The girls explore the surrounding wilderness and have an encounter with Totoro, a cuddly, cute, fat, imaginary forest 'spirit'. Totoro can only be seen by the girls and even then, only occasionally. The movie does not have an ongoing perpetual plot but it doesn't need to. Its an endearing story about a few months in the life of two young sisters. There is no clear villain the the film. The dad is not an uncaring workaholic, the mean kid next door isn't really that bad, and the somewhat scary old neighbor is kind and wise. Everyone has their good and bad points and Hayao miyazaki does a great job of showing them.Though the movie is about the imagination of little kids, it has this incredible sense of reality. The little 4 year old is cute but loud and demanding like all young children. Satsuki, the elder sister, is protective over her little sister and a bit bossy. There is a scene of a boy playing with a toy trying to avoid a chore. Despite the fact that it is such a calm movie, when a crisis occurs, you're at the edge of the seat, worrying, because the movie, unlike most animated films, it luckily lacks that element of "There's Always going to be a Happy Ending" The drawing is great. Its so natural and there are these scenes of wonderful sereneness. It's just so pleasant to watch. I just hate kids, but every single time after watching this movie, I just feel like hugging every little girl I see. I think it is impossible for anyone not to like Totoro because it is just this incredible masterpiece that erases any doubt in mankind. I can't come close to putting the wonders of this movie in words, and all i have to say is watch it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It pains me to give it an average rating, but the fact that I wanted more of it proves that I was enjoying what we got before it came to an abrupt end. I was certain that I had accidentally hit the chapter skip button my remote, but nope, I did indeed watch the whole movie.It's summer 1955 and very cute and curious 4-year-old Mei and her sister Satsuki move out into the country with their dad while their mother is in hospital. The creaky, dusty old house that they move into appears to be hot spot for forest spirits and magical creatures. As with all Hayao Miyazaki movies there is a heavy theme of nature being beautiful and the Earth being precious but where is the story?Mei soon meets "Totoro" a giant cat/rabbit thing, who does...pretty much nothing. Totoro is barely IN the movie. I've seen pictures of him for years, I even carry around a Totoro satchel at work. I assumed that the movie would be filled with their wondrous discoveries, summertime adventures, and, y'know, some kind of PLOT! But nope. He's barely in it. Seriously, where is the rest of this film? I assume all those picture I saw were merely fan art and not stills from the actual film.At one point Mei runs off to find her mother but gets lost on her way to the hospital. Satsuki enlists Totoro to help her and he summons the Catbus to locate Mei and take them both to the hospital and the film ends there. That's it! My jaw was on the floor when the credits began to roll, and not in a good way.The animation is simply beautiful and is the perfect antidote to the ostentatious horror of modern CGI animated movies, the kids are cute, and Totoro (all 2 minutes he has on screen) is one of the most huggable characters ever created, but I am sorry I have to rate this on the lower rung of Miyazaki movies. There should have been more to this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Stunning Work from Hayao Miyazaki</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first saw this movie when I was very, very young. I loved it then and I love it now. It is like a beautiful painting. The visuals are fantastic, the plot charming, and the "totoros" are adorable (not to mention Mei). Miyazaki has refused to follow in the footsteps of other Japanese film-makers and do those awful anime movies that are, unfortunately, popular among many of my friends. Instead, he has made animated films that look and are captivating. I love how he did the fantasy element in this movie, with the totoros flying and doing magical wonders and Satsuki and Mei looking like they're having the time of their life. My favorite part is when Satsuki and Mei sneak outside to see the totoros and they make the trees grow (and their father has no clue!). The enchanting music during that part was what made it memorable. A must-see for all little kids.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Introduction to one of the greatest storytellers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After seeing both Chihiro (2001) and Howl's Moving Castle (2004), I instantly became a Miyazaki fan. I am especially fascinated by the mix of western and non-western mythological worlds, in which the different characters are developed. As a fan, it is IMO a must to see all of his films.My Neighbor Totoro (1988) is one of his most beautiful and charming works, and I recommend this particular piece to first-time Miyazaki-viewers as an introduction to one of the greatest storytellers in the history of cinema.While this story is simple and not as wildly imaginative as some of Miyazaki's recent works, the storyline has a slightly more emotional touch.The story is about two sisters who are moving to the country side with their father ? the mother being permanently in the hospital. The story takes off, when the youngest girl unintentionally falls down into a deep ravine and finds the protector of the forest - Totoro. Together with this wonderfully, flighty and friendly forest creature, the children experience one of the most fantastical journeys, physical as well mental.If you have watched Miyazaki's latest productions you will know that his universe - social deliberated, humorous and ecological - appeals to children and adults alike. This is also most certainly the case with My Neighbor Totoro.I give this movie 9/10, as it is one of the best family films ever made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Essential Viewing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was initially skeptical on the quality of this one, but surprisingly this film was both engaging and beautiful from start to finish. Loosely based on Miyazakis own childhood, My Neighbor Totoro is a simplistic story with a kind of charm, depth, and broad appeal that makes it irresistible. When two girls move to a new farmhouse to be closer to their ailing mother, they have to deal with some of life's more eccentric experiences, that of impending death and incredible magic. At its heart, its about the uninhibited curiosity of childhood, and the innocence in accepting everything without question, to such an extent that magic is a very real reality. The otherworldly in this film, comes in the form of Totoro, an animal spirit who is the guardian of the forest near the girls home. Overall, this film is absolutely spectacular. Kids will love it, though some of the deeper meaning will be lost on them. Adults will also love it, as a nostalgic ride through childhood and for some of the more profound themes running throughout the film. Technically, though made in 1988, the animation in this film looks every bit as stunning today. Totoros forest and the many quiet landscape shots are absolutely gorgeous. Disney, eat your heart out. The film is paced slow, letting the film unfurl at a relaxing pace through its scant 86 minute runtime. The lethargic pace, along with Miyazakis expressive camera pans and attention to detail lend the girls discovery of their home/the forest, the famous cat bus scene, and every moment with Totoro a very 360 degree, hypnotic feel. The new English dub is well done without losing much in translation, retaining the witty and lighthearted exchanges from the original. Overall, this films serves as a great introduction into the world of Miyazaki, and remains a timeless classic in its own right. Miyazakis most lighthearted venture also remains his most introspective and grounded work. Even without the whimsicality of Spirited Away and Kikis Delivery Service, this is by far his most engaging and charming film. Essential viewing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A wonderful movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie is from Japan and it is 20 years old -- it feels fresh as if done yesterday and there is no cultural barrier whatsoever. The drawings of the landscape are fantastic and are alone worth watching this movie: the reflection of the sun on the leaves of the trees, the reflection of the sky in the rice paddies, the high summer clouds, the flowers detailed and colorful.Two girls, maybe four and ten, move with their father into their new house in this landscape. How they discover, befriend, and master their new environment is shown in a detailed, loving, but not sentimental way. Watching these girls create their own adventures and act and react in them, is delightful. Even more, they reveal something deeply human; and the audience can rediscover its own humanness by watching and identifying with them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Nutshell Review: (DVD) My Neighbor Totoro (1988)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have never sat through a complete Hayao Miyazaki animated movie despite all the good vibes, reviews, recommendations I got from friends. Actually I have Spirited Away on DVD just waiting to be watched, but for some reason it still sits on my desk amongst others. Well, a good friend from up north passed me THREE Miyazaki DVDs, and given I'm going to where he is tomorrow visiting someone who mentioned during a visit to the previous movie set, how the scene was reminiscent of My Neighbor Totoro, I thought I'll pop that DVD and give it a watch.I was blown away. This IS animation, with a story suitable for kids to understand, and for adults to get a kick out of given its fantastical pieces. I shan't spoil the movie by spelling out the storyline, but suffice to say it centers very simply on a family, the father a professor who has recently uprooted his family of two girls, Satsuki and Mai, to the countryside, to provide a healthier environment for their ailing mom, currently in the hospital, to recuperate in. Thus begins the children's adventures in the country, with its lush greenery, and of course, with their new found friend, a giant ghibil known as Totoro, with seemingly magical powers of flight and fantasy.And it is in its simplicity where its beauty shines through. It is always said that children can see things that adults don't, and hence, there's a constant question as to whether Totoro is real, or not, and if so, how its interactions with the kids are possible. It's not just Totoro itself which is out of this world, but I totally like that grinning cat-bus.This is the kind of animated movie that our local animation production houses should be looking at. First and foremost, the story. While it doesn't contain huge battle sequences, complex or multiple characters for the sake of stuffing the movie, it goes to show that the story matters, in its ability to touch and resonate with audiences young and old (while the young ones go to the cinemas, don't forget the adults have to bring them too, and somehow you have to entertain them as well without being too complex for the little ones to understand).The character designs are also kept simple, but nonetheless effective. The animation here is top notch despite it being 2D, as are the cast who voiced the characters. The acid test here is whether the movie can stand the test of time, and watching it close to 20 years after it was made, the answer is a resounding yes, it passed with flying colours. There are plenty of moments where you go "so cute!" without it being saccharine, or trying too hard, and that is indeed remarkable. Characterization is superb, especially Mai, whom I think everyone who has a kid sister, would be able to relate to. That's how realistic I thought she was!Everything in this movie works well together, like a fine orchestra performing its pieces with precision yet with lots of heart. I do feel compelled to pop in and watch all the other Hayao Miyazaki DVDs I have in my collection, but I have to travel tomorrow and be away the next few days. You can be sure however, I will be back and complete watching them all real soon!I like Tonari no Totoro, certainly one of the best movies I've seen!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A remarkably enjoyable film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I keep watching Studio Ghibli films like this one expecting that in all the films that they've made, there's got to be one that just doesn't hold up. Well, My Neighbor Totoro isn't that one.This is a beautiful and exuberant story story about a pair of kids that move into the country with their father and meet some of the less visible residents, including some lively dustbunnies and the giant Totoro. Although this could just be a story about kids meeting the magical residents of their rural community, the story deals a lot with the relationship between the two young sisters and their parents as well.One thing that's absolutely charming about this film is the realness of the relationship between the sisters, with the younger Mei commonly copying her older sister Satsuki, getting upset and bratty and unreasonable in addition to being ridiculously cute at times, while Satsuki gets worried and dutiful. It makes some interesting observations about different family roles and I found myself surprised at how it made me re-examine my role in my family.I wouldn't say it's a remarkably deep film, but the little observations that it makes causes it to be a lot more than just simple children's entertainment. The characters are complex and multi-faceted and surprisingly real for animated images.The voice acting in English is decent, but still doesn't fully connect with the Japanese dressing. Hearing a "Yes!" in English just doesn't have the same sort of exuberance that the Japanese kid shouting "Hai!" has. But it's good enough that the dubbed soundtrack won't be distracting.All in all, I have to say this is a remarkably enjoyable film and wonderful for children and the older folks that watch with them. (As well as the child in you.) 8/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I took my six-year-old son to see "My Neighbour Totoro" at a film festival recently and about halfway through he loudly announced to the full house that "This is a GREAT movie". A somewhat embarrassing moment for me, but I think few of the 500-odd crowd would have disagreed.It must surely rate somewhere at the apex of the cartoonist's art. The scenes are magnificently detailed, and the action portrays real humans of the kind we all know and love, seamlessly moving into the fantastic realms that we would all _like_ to know and love.Aside from the beautiful artwork, the music supports the action all the way through, and there are several good stories woven into the movie as well.The copy I saw was subtitled in excellent English and some of the younger audience may have trouble with that, although they would probably still find the movie very enjoyable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Magical film for young and old!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hands down, 'My Neighbour Totoro' is far superior to any film ever produced by Disney and that's including my personal favourites 'The Lion King' and 'Hercules'.It revolves around two young girls Satsuki (aged around eight) and Mei (aged around three) who move to a new house while also coping with their mother's illness in the resilient, sweet way young children have in dealing with problems. They then discover these furry totoro creatures only ever seen by children and through their new friends, they are able to face their fears.You can actually feel the magic when you watch this. The totoros are adorable and their haunting silence only intensifies their beauty and the two children are so innocent and captivating that you completely empathise with their delight at meeting these fabled creatures.Although I watched it a few times when I was around 12, I rediscovered this in Disney Land (Disney own the rights now) and walked from the Britain exhibit in EPCOT back to Japan to buy the cuddly Totoro toy which is now my most prized possession from that Florida holiday. At the moment, this excellent film is not on DVD in Britain for some criminal reason, I hope now that Disney own it they will release it soon enough. I would certainly reccommend it to anyone of any age.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Miyazaki's Absolutely Hilarious, Culturally Significant Story of Existence, Location and Expedition, Rather Than Rivalry and Danger.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This culturally significant Kodomo anime has become one of the most endeared of all family films without ever having been much popularized or sponsored, which is a testament to its magic. This is one of the tenderly hand-crafted works of Hayao Miyazaki, perhaps the greatest of the Japanese animators, yet his collaborator at the Ghibli Studios, Isao Takahata, who fashioned Grave of the Fireflies, may be his rival. Miyazaki has not until quite lately used computers to animate his films. They are drawn a frame at a time, the time-honored way, with the master himself providing tens of thousands of the frames.Miyazaki's films are in particular viscerally entrancing, using a watercolor look for the backgrounds and working within the unique anime tradition of characters with big round eyes and mouths that can be as minute as a fleck or as enormous as a cave. They also have an spontaneous authenticity in the way they mind minutiae.The movie tells the story of two young sisters who share a wonderful bond. As it opens, their father is driving them to their new house, near a boundless forest. Their mother, who is ill, has been moved to a hospital in this community. Now think about that. The film is about two girls, not two boys or a boy and a girl, as all American cartoon films would be. It has a resolute and loving father, in contradiction to the recent Hollywood affinity for selfish or absent fathers. Their mother is sick: Does sickness happen in American family cartoons?A neighbor boy later tells them their new house is haunted. But not haunted in the American sense, with ghosts or forbidding creations. When the girls let light into the shadow, they get just a peek of little black fuzzy dots scampering to refuge. ''Probably just dust bunnies,'' says their father, but there is an old nanny who has been employed to look after them, and she suggests that they are ''soot sprites,'' which like empty houses, and will pack up and leave when they hear laughter. Perhaps I'm reading too much in, but during this scene, I feel like I caught a brief reference to Ingmar Bergman's Through a Glass Darkly, as one sister stares transfixed at a crack in the wall.Assent to how the father composedly receives their account of arcane critters. Are sprites and totoros for real? They surely do in the minds of the girls. So do other hilarious beasts, such as the Cat Bus, which bustles through the forest on eight fast paws, its big eyes working as headlights. Instead of letting the children be scared of hauntings and the soundness of their own minds, the elders teach them to like and enjoy it all. They go along with it rather than irrationally making them feel silly.While it's not necessarily clear whether or not the adults actually consider them, not once does Miyazaki trot out the relic children's literature adage of The Adults Who Think The Child Is A Liar, So Child Is Going To Have To Save The World Without Them. This welcoming approach to accustomed Japanese spirit-creatures imparts a telling distinction between our two cultures. In America, there must always be something to fear, always a scapegoat, always something or someone to antagonize. No matter how equally violent or aggressive the history is of Japan, they do not thrive on fear factors. It is a beacon of great hope and pleasure to me that family films are the rudimentary place where cultural difference is easiest to discern in the movies.My Neighbor Totoro is made of existence, location and expedition, not on rivalry and danger. This is made crystal in the engrossingly extensive sequences involving totoros, which actually are not Japanese myth, but were indeed created by Miyazaki specifically for this movie. In these sequences, Miyazaki gets no mileage out of any trite ideas about the dark and dreadful forest. It's only nature. Is the film sometimes corny and absurd? Yes, but it knows when to be quiet and real.One of the funniest scenes I think I've ever seen on film occurs when the girls go to meet their father's bus. But the hour grows late and the woods grow dark. Without a sound, matter-of-factly, the giant totoro joins them at the bus stop, standing to one side as if it's been there the whole time. It starts to rain. The girls have umbrellas, and give one to the totoro, who is fascinated by the raindrops on the umbrella, and jumps up and down to render free a downrush of drops from the trees. Watch how coolly and constructively the scene has been handled, with the night, the forest, the lateness of the father seen as a circumstance, not an omen. The movie needs no villains. I remember that Winnie the Pooh also had no evil characters at first, but that in its new American version evil weasels have been interposed into his benevolent setting.But it would never have won its worldwide audience simply owing to its fuzzy heart. It is also full of mortal humor in the manner in which it perceives the two exceptionally authentic, realistic little girls, and I refer to their characterizations, not their physicality. It is side- splitting in the scenes involving the totoro, and in the scenes with the ridiculous Cat Bus. It is a little tearful, a little hair-raising, a little out of the blue and a little enlightening, just like life itself. The film expresses a refreshing ideology with Miyazaki later deepens and defines in his more recent films. Look at the minimal amount of external things in these girls' lives, or their father's, or the nanny's. Their story exists as a situation rather than a plot, and suggests that the uncertainty of life and the makeshifts of invention afford all the enterprising escapades one needs.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is our 16-month old son's favorite movie and mine too! He asks for it constantly-- it is completely non-violent, and we don't mind letting him watch once or twice a day. So, I have probably seen it a hundred times by now, but I am still enjoying it and seeing and hearing new details. The film respectfully portrays so many slippery nuances of childhood--powerful emotions, unexpected perceptions, and secret worlds of adventure. I think our baby might like it because it's helping him learn how to be a little kid. He loves the music, the tree, the baby girl Mei, the Dad, the catbus, and especially the totoro (although this is also the scariest part for him).I would highly recommend this film for anyone except adolescents, who might find it sort of dull and goody-goody.</fullReview>

The main two characters have enjoyable personalities as well. This brings us to why the 5/10.To be plain and simple, I found the movie extremely boring. Watching a movie such as Spirited Away or Kiki's Delivery Service, you will notice that they're rather relaxing and aren't paced that fast but you knew the movie was building to something. That is one of the major reasons why I like Ghibli films and what I was expecting again with My Neighbor Totoro. Unfortunately that was not the case and I was left wondering when the movie was going to climax or what adversity the characters are going to face.I was left disappointed that the characters that i started to like during the beginning of the film never really changed or learned some sort of lesson. At the end of the day, I was left underwhelmed especially since I have heard nothing but good things about this movie from anyone who mentions it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hayao Miyazaki is a genius. Most critics and moviegoers will second that notion. My Neighbor Totoro, one of his earlier features, is evidence of that claim. On several occasions when recommending this film to friends they have asked me, "Well, what is the movie about?" And, well, that is mostly hard to explain. There is no set plot, structure, nor is there much conflict; the film simply follows the lives of two little girls that meet the King of the Forest, Totoro. The film is from the perspective of a child, which, in my opinion, is the core of this film's brilliance. You can't help but watch the film without being imbued with a sense of jubilant wonder, joy, and warmth. This movie is older than I am, but still feels new and original. Everything from the music to the scenery to the dialogue is top-notch. I would recommend getting the 2005 English version with Dakota and Elle Fanning, Pat Carroll and Tim Daly, though both English dubbings are great.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a difficult film to pigeonhole. It is apparently simple, made up of the tiny, everyday events in a child's life, but unlike many films for and about children, it doesn't ignore the huge shadows those events cast in the imagination. Some critics have said that not much happens in My Neighbor Totoro, but discovering a new world, learning the cycle of nature, and facing up to the fear of death is more than enough action to sustain a film, especially in director Hayao Miyazaki's hands. The film is, of course, breathtakingly beautiful. The action may be small-scale but the vistas are incredible. Joe Hisaishi creates what may well be his greatest ever score, another miracle of seeming simplicity. In terms of story, design, animation, and music, this film achieves its aims so perfectly that it's almost absurd to give it a rating. Miyazaki set the film in the remembered landscape of his own childhood. Never sentimental, never dishonest, never preaching, and never failing to acknowledge the realities of life, he has made a film with more magic in it than any number of wizards and superheroes could create. The film became so popular that Studio Ghibli adopted Totoro as the company mascot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My Neighbor Totoro turned me into a little squish-ball, and I mean that as a compliment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>That one line summary refers to, basically, what it feels like to be a kid and get delighted by a story and characters that are (to use an overused word) enchanting. In fact, this film to me represents the kind of enjoyment I had as a very young tot watching the Winnie the Pooh films. It is so in touch with the innocence and escapism of children that it actually works for the adults too. As a man already in his twenties, I was really taken aback by how adorable all of the little woodland creatures are- the "King" Totoro, the Cat bus, the other little creatures alongside him- and how it wasn't annoying or nearing that. This is the kind of Japanese-export that puts an entertainment like Pokemon, which is all about conflict and defeat and trying to save the end of everything from some super-chu or whatever, as the fun if shallow stuff that it is. Here is a story that works much more like a fairy tale, where there is almost no real conflicts that are impending or spelling deep trouble, only the exaggerated thoughts and occasionally distraught emotions of kids 4-10 years old. Hayao Miyazaki is really, truly in touch with these feelings that go about with kids like these.If anything might be lacking in the film it's a 'plot' or sorts, as there really isn't any- a story it does have, however loose with what goes on. It's a pure kind of feel-good story about two young girls who have moved into a new house with their father so they can be closer to their mother who's at a hospital. After finding their house might be haunted, the younger of the two Mei searches around a gigantic tree to find Totoro and his buddies, who help make things grow in nature and are generally just there to act like fuzz-balls. Aside from a bit of trouble that arises in the third act, which does hold some overall significance to the implicit message in the film, it's really got nothing on its agenda except to give the little kids a big smile and some laughs in some of the cuter, odder moments. If some American kids might not get it or latch on to it like the homegrown animation of late, it might still work for their parents probably watching it with them.And this message I mentioned- which is also connected with Winnie the Pooh on some fundamental level- is that its essential to have this kind of lively dream-life for children, to have a section of the world just for them where nothing bad or upsetting can protrude through. But, like Miyazaki's other films, this isn't a message crammed down the kids throats. It's also for me (damned if I'll say it as a guy who's usually into more mature dramas and such) one of the most charming and cute pieces of animation to ever come out of Japan, and I would give it such a recommendation that the Pooh movies meant for me- as a first movie for a little one to see and maybe get addicted to.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Extremely cute(in a good way!)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you see a movie like 'My Little Pony', you think "CUTE!" and feel like puking. That's a common trait in children's movies today. Too many bright colours, boring and dumbed-down dialog, and tired and boring concepts.This usually stems from the problem that only grown-ups make movies. But this movie is also made by grown-ups. So what's so different? I think Miyazaki has very good contact with his inner child. It sounds corny, I know, but he's spot on with every line, every movement, in fact everything the wonderful two sisters do in this movie.American child heroes are usually very grown-up. They speak pretty much like an adult. They remind more of the kind of children we see all the time in horror movies(the kind who has black makeup under the eyes and says eerie things to the main character) than real children. If they're not like that, they're painfully cute and stupid. But not in this movie.The plot is wonderful as well. It's magical enough to appeal the children and serious enough to affect grown-ups. It's a rare mix. Most importantly, it's gripping. You really care for the characters, you feel happy when they're happy and you feel bad when they're in danger.In conclusion, Totoro is a really cute movie but not in the usual brain-dead way we Westerners have become used to. It's as good as Disney in its prime, and in some ways better. It's easily the best movie you can let you children watch made in the latest 20 years. Mom and Dad might want to turn off the dubbing and watch the Japanese version as well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I love Totoro</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love this movie for the following reasons. First, the characters are very very cute. Mei has pure heart and she believes in natural wonders. Satsuki is kind and always think of Mei. Above all Totoro's big and round eyes are incredibly wonderful. Second, music is good. Heart-warming music fits the movie?fs warm atmosphere. I saw the Lilo&amp;Stitch shortly before I saw Tonari-no-Totoro. Lilo&amp;Stitch's score has strong impacts, but I like soft music in Totoro. I can recommend this movie to all mothers and children.They can learn how valuable a family is through this movie.I rate this movie at 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really love this film! All characters are very kind-hearted and have an attractive personality. And their behaviors and expressions are realistic. And, I feel that they're really familiar to me. The music and words are also perfect for the story. It makes me feel really excited. The story teaches me the importance of love and dream! Lilo &amp; Stich produced by Disney, Tonari no Totoro produced by Gyibli are similar in that in both sisters appear. But, Tonari no Ttoro doesn?ft have any offensive scene and is more full of love and dream. I really want to meet Totoro &amp; Nekobus to return to my childhood! I recommend this film to all people. Because, I think this film gives something wonderful to any people of any age. Each individual can enjoy this film from his or her point of view.I rate this film at 10/10 !!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great animated film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Most animated movies, for children and adults, have a hero or heroes and at least one great villain. With 'My Neighbor Totoro' it is different. This movie shows us a wonderful world of animation without a villain. This does not mean the movie is boring or nothing is happening. A lot is happening. There is comedy, drama and suspense but this movie does not need a villain. The only villain there probably is, is the illness the mother of Satsuki (Noriko Hidaka) and Mei (Chika Sakamoto) suffers.I can be short about the story. A father moves with his two daughters to a new home, close to his wife who is sick. The children discover spirits in the forest, not visible for adults. An adventure with the children and the spirits is what follows, with Totoro as the leading spirit.'My Neighbor Totoro' with its friendly and original story is entertaining from start to finish. Hayao Miyazaki, the great Japanese animator, has created a wonderful world with his imagination and animation. Definitely recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Last night, I went to a rave party. Because of that, I can't sleep tonight, even as tomorrow is my birthday. So I decided to watch some anime. Tonari no Totoro had been given a very nice average score here at imdb, so I settled for it. It seems fortune itself has decided to give me this birthday present that is the pure joy of watching this movie. I mentioned in a review of another anime (Kiki's Delivery Service), that it reminded me of Astrid Lindgren's "Pippi Longstockings" which I was fed with as a swedish child. This movie is just about as fine! It gives me an insight of what it must've been like to be a child growing up at the countryside in the japanese 50s (which I guess is the setting for this movie), and at the same time it reminds me of what it was like for myself to grow up back when I lived in a house in the suburbs of Stockholm with a fairly large garden.I started smiling after watching this movie for about ten minutes, then I kept on smiling unto the worrying part (you will know what I mean if you have seen/will see the movie). How about that, by the way? An anime for kids that gets a 22-year old like me worried when the plot becomes saddening? Anyway, when the credits started rolling by with a beautiful, playful song in the background, I was smiling once again. This movie deserves no other grade than a 10, and that's what I'm about to give it :)- Johan</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Subtle and poetic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Two little girls, Satsuki and Mei, moves into an old house in the Japanese country with their father. Their sick mother is at the hospital. The two kids meet the gentle and flute playing Totoro, a hybrid between a gigantic rodent and a bear. The movie's style is quite different from most Western animations, and only a few Disney movies can hold their own to Tonari no Totoro's amazing and poetic expression. The bus stop scene is brilliant, and so are many other similar scenes where only few words are spoken. Disney animations are often too restless to create an atmosphere like this. Pardoxically the two children are a bit stereotypical at times, but in the end of the movie they become more complex. At this point in the film a cryptic message from the mother's hospital, makes the children suspect that their mother has died. After an intense drama they are being flown to the hospital in Totoro's bizarre cat bus. But it turns out that the mother has only had a cold and that she's going to comeback to them soon. This is, though a foundation for a happy ending, a bit of an anticlimax. I couldn't help but wonder if the movie would be better if the mother was dead from the start of the film. Not that I'm a sadist, but as it is, the children are living a great life in a beautiful place, and when their mother comes back, all is practically well, this would make it seem so perfect, that you don't feel like you have to pity the kids, which makes their attempt in finding comfort in their friendship with Totoro less touching than it could be. If the mother was dead, the movie would probably touch some deeper feelings. But this is only a thought. However, a psychological interpretation could be that the mother really is dying, and Totoro only is a delusion made by the children in their grief. But this would however be too cruel. Perhaps the perfectly happy ending is the best way to end the film, though a sad future awaits the children when they get too old to see Totoro. Though I'm not a big fan of the manga style I must admit that it's masterfully animated, and the imaginative pictures make the movie seem like a beautiful dream.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>one of Miyazaki's finest films to date</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have never been so happy whilst watching a film, after a film and even at the beginning of a film. I found myself smiling all the way through. The characters are all so lovable, I marvel at Hayao miyazaki's ability to create something truly imaginative out of every standard object. The film is visually beautiful and wondrous. What was also heart warming was the relationship between the father, mother and kiddies, it's everybody's ideal family unit. It reflected well the older sister younger sister relationship, leaving the viewer feeling very nostalgic. The cat embodied everything that a child desires from a companion. The film managed to capture the world that children live in and take you back to what it felt like to be a child living in your own idealist environment. Basically i feel it's impossible for anybody to watch this film and be left feeling cold. It warms you from your toes to the tip of your head, you'll be smiling for days.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best animated movie ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love Totoro, Mei and Satsuki. I have been seeing the movie many times without getting bored while I become tired of seeing other movies easily right at the second or third time. I can't imagine how the director can create such real and cute characters. Notice the way Mei goes upstairs and downstairs, showing Myazaki to be very observant about children's actions. They are amazing compared to conventional move of Waldisney's as well as of many other animated movies. The movie is a simple story with normal circumstances of daily life, about a family with 4 members, the father is a university professor, the mother is in hospital because of suffering from a disease unknown and the two children of 10 and 4 years old are still very innocent. The family is as ordinary as most of real families around us but described within several selective days. That is when they move to a new house in the beautiful countryside. The fresh scene encourages the two children to discover everything they see and this leads them to meeting with Totoro. Totoro is only a character of imagination but more real than any other imagined characters. He looks like a bear and may symbol children's belief in good things of life. One of the scenes i like best is that of the three people bathing together when a very serious storm goes through the area, shaking the house and scaring the two children, so warm. And the scenes of field, hills remind me of my childhood as if it was just yesterday. For me this is Myazaki's best animated movie and one of the best animations of all time. Voted it 10 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can't say enough of the animation, which I thoroughly enjoyed. Despite this, I'm not sure what message the film sends, besides being a child-like distraction. Maybe that's the point, and I guess that's OK for kids, but nothing really stands out in a cohesive way for adults. Another possible message involves the tension between childish innocence (as represented by Totoro?) and the worries of growing into adulthood, though I'm not entirely sure what that message is other than being true prima facie.All in all, the film is too ambiguous in the conflict department, and as a result is lacking in immersion for the viewer. Even children's films deserve better than this. Though also a flawed and somewhat rambling film, I prefer Spirited Away.My Neighbor Totoro gets 2 out of 4 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Get the Non-Disney Version</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Totoro is one of our family's favorite movies of all time. We watch it again and again, so much that there is a chip in the middle of the disc. So when I saw the title at Costco or someplace I grabbed it to have a second copy. My kids just watched it today and they were sorely disappointed to see that Disney had wrecked their favorite movie. For whatever reason, they took it upon themselves to "improve" or update the film. They changed many of the voices and also changed some names and also the dialogue, all in bad ways. Did they not learn anything from the reaction to The Last Airbender? The result is a darker and less pleasing version than the original. So by all means get this movie but try to find the non-2005 version as originally dubbed into English under the direction of the boys in Japan rather than the cultural destroyers from Anaheim/Florida.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Miyazaki's best work, simply fantastic!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hayao Miyazaki didn't go extravagant like he did in his most critically acclaimed works such as Princess Mononoke and Spirited Away. My Neighbor Totoro is simple but still imaginative like all his works, and it is quite simply a masterpiece. Even though Totoro doesn't seems he wanted to be lovable, even though he looks scary because of his huge eyes and large mouth, he remains to be one of the loveliest characters of Hayao Miyazaki, quiet but unforgettable, he is like a Teddy Bear. If Satsuki and Mai was amazed when they saw Totoro the first time, well I'm astonished when I saw the half-cat, half-bus creature, it is magical to see that. He didn't go far in this one, but it's the first film that I've seen from him that has a heart.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Delightful "slice of life" film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Miyazaki's animé films differ considerably from the usual (Disney) animated films both in art form and narrative: -- The art work in many animated films is similar to that in Mickey Mouse cartoons: outlines or features that are colored/shaded in; some movements are exaggerated for dramatic effect; almost all stories have adversaries or problems that the hero/heroine defeats near the conclusion. -- In Miyazaki's animé films, the backgrounds (landscapes, skies, interiors of homes, etc.)are beautifully, naturally rendered: e.g., weathered planks of wood have the texture and color of the real thing; clouds look very realistic. But while the actions, reactions, emotions and movements of people are very realistic, the visual, artistic rendering of people (&amp; animals &amp; fantasy creatures) is more cartoonish; the animals and fantasy creatures frequently move in ways not possible for people. But, while these human figures are cartoon-like, their reactions, emotions, motives, etc., are VERY realistic. Many of Miyazaki's films have a "slice of life" quality--there's no big conflict and climax of resolution; his films show life.Also, Miyazaki's films often mix objects (cars, phones, radios) from different time frames and some of that occurs here with telephones from the '30s, and a radio and 3 wheeled motorcycle van from the '40s. This video clip shows some of this quality: http://w w w.imdb.com/video/screenplay/vi477103897/ (copy link &amp; remove spaces between w w w to activate.)In "My Neighbor Totoro," the two principle characters are sisters: Mei, 4 years old, who is sometimes too spunky and daring and her older sister, Satseki, about 8-10 years old, who cares for Mei when she's home from school. The movie opens with the 2 girls and their father moving to a home in the country which will permit them to be closer to the girls' mother who is recuperating in a hospital.The old house they move into is said to be haunted (the sisters DO see some soot sprites). In a nearby forest, they find a large, somewhat pear-shaped, friendly magical forest creature they name Totoro and two much smaller similar creatures.The movie deals with their adventures in their new home, with Satseki's school, with adventures while waiting for their mother to recover, etc.Lovely to watch. The capturing of the girls' interactions between themselves and with others is remarkably well observed and captured.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A masterpiece for all the ages</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Miyazaki has to be one of the greatest and most creative artists and film-makers alive. Creating some of the most well crafted and unique animated features of recent years, Miyazaki makes his film very personally, checking thousands and thousands of the frames himself. To top it off most of his films are made with either very minimal use of or no use of computer animation. While I believe CG animated features are an art and respectable side-genre of animated films, there is something always refreshing about seeing hand-drawn images, especially ones as vibrant and creative as Miyazaki's. "My Neighbor Totoro" is one of Miyazaki's earliest films as director and what he crafts here is a magical film that proves that plot is not everything. The premise of "Totoro" is not bad or stupid, but not the strong point of the film. However, it serves it's purpose, and Miyazaki uses his simplistic plot line to help contribute to the aura he gives his film. As with any Studio Ghibli film the visuals are astounding. The creature designs of the Totoro, his small friends, the elaborate cat bus, and even the human characters is pure magic. One thing that I absolutely love about "My Neighbor Totoro", which is really a very minor feature of the film, but an important one. When the young daughter tells her father that she has seen the mystical creature, Totoro, the father does not scoff at her 'fantasy' or tell her that there is no such thing as a Totoro, but instead goes along with her. It's such a breath of fresh air to see a father figure especially in a children's fantasy film believing the wild accusations of his young daughter. It's true that "Totoro" doesn't real involve any main conflict, but that is the beauty of it. Towards the end there is a bit of a dilemma, but not to the point where it turns into the typical structure of most kid's flicks. "Totoro" relies on enchanting visuals, insightful character writing and charm. So many movies are dark and depressing and while I fully stand behind depressing movies it's nice to see a movie that makes you feel good. "My Neighbor Totoro" not only makes you feel good, but it also leaves you with a warm fuzzy feeling. If you're a parent I highly suggest you show this film to your children for two reasons. 1) I know that they'll love and 2) it's a movie for little kids that you will thoroughly enjoy as an adult as well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you are sick of taking your children to see movies written by Disney where their intelligence will be insulted by stereotypical and unrealistic representations of children, consider showing them Totoro.It is everything Disney is incapable of creating.. intelligent and heart warming with believable characters. Hayao Miyazaki doesn't need to rely on the same old cheap tricks to keep his movies interesting because he has something special.. he hasn't lost touch with the innocence and wonder of being a child, which is why he's so perfectly able to represent Mei and Satsuki's emotions and draw you into their world in this movie.It isn't action packed or epic, but it doesn't need to be because it is far more special, individual and unique than any "children's" movie created in the last twenty years. This isn't a movie to be appreciate by children only, it is one of the rare movies that will be appreciated on different levels by viewers of all ages.You must watch Totoro, and I would highly recommend watching it in subtitled format. The American voice actors do not demonstrate the ability of their Japanese counterparts and reduce the enjoyability of the movie greatly.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Underdog of Ghibli</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've always had an inclination toward animation whether it's been for children, adults or just overhauled that dichotomy.I've also enjoyed pretty much anything Japanese (Kabuki, Ikebana, Origami) for years now and although I'm kind of embarrassed to admit it, Hayao Miyazaki is probably my 2nd favorite film maker (after Takahata).Yet, I still feel that Totoru is over-rated. Firstly, there isn't enough conflict. There's a little excitement in moving to a new home but every character is content with the change and gets along fine.There's some intrigue in those ash things but it doesn't really go anywhere. The only emotive appeal with any strength is the sick mother but we only see her in a state of convalescence.Totoru himself only appears sporadically and doesn't have much bearing on the plot. There are shots of him that are perfectly composed and instantly iconic but they're just great moments in slow, humdrum scenes. The plot doesn't intrigue me at all. The scenes for the most part or disconnected and the climax is probably the most tacked on I've ever seen with the possible exception of Twilight.I suppose it's a rejection of the 3 act structure and just tries to capture the episodic beauty in normal life with a little touch of the supernatural for good measure. In that respect, it's Miyazaki's most Takahatian film. For me, it feels from the beginning like a fairy tale for the inner child so I guess it lured me into the wrong mentality to enjoy it. Considering this, I can respect a little more but it just lacks the charm of Takahata because everyone is a little too happy.I'm reluctant to consider this a children's movie. I'm just skeptical that my preteen self would ever have had the patience with a movie with so little momentum even if I could get over that there's no antagonist. Miyazaki's films usually have some message or social commentary in them. I don't like them specifically for this reason but it's worth noting that there's no lesson or conclusion drawn from the story.Ultimately, my opinions are probably a minority so if you like the writer or the studio, try this movie. It was the film that gained Ghibli fame in Japan and Totoru is essentially to Japanese culture what Mickey Mouse is to American.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beware the VHS</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After rewatching this recently on DVD, part of the box set from director Miyazaki's Studio Ghibli, I wanted to buy it for my elderly mother. She'd been enthralled by Princess Mononoke at my place not long before. Since neither she nor my father can handle subtitles, I ordered the best I could find, a dubbed pan-and-scan VHS. What a disaster! But, a disaster with a fine message.Totoro, like every Miyazaki film, is a glorious soundscape. No less than the script and visuals, sounds--her own, verbal and not, and those around her reflected in her every squeak and movement, every sigh, every audible breath--establish the younger child, Mei, as protagonist. Without her unique pass, we have no entrance into the film. This old VHS, besides lopping off so much of the frame that ambient sounds too often make little sense anyway, mutes that part of the soundtrack in favor of vocals, killing nature and Mei along with it as surely as the 'villains' in so many other Ghibli films kill Nature. Mei's words are dubbed, but she's hardly alive here. Untampered with though, this may be Miyazaki's finest and Mei his truest characterization.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I learned</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sometimes, however rarely, it is possible to tell a story without an enemy, yet still have meaning, to tell something that matters. Something that changes those who hear it. Surely, all stories require conflict. Change, something happening, is conflict in and on itself, for change means that something has to go away, to die, even if it is just an idea of a moment. But conflict does not have to be an enemy.I learned that from My Neighbor Totoro.I also learned how to walk through a house yard, viewing it through the eyes of a child. I learned that tall grass can hide wondrous creatures and that it can be a pretty scary place. Overgrowing forests are a labyrinth, a place to get lost, but also to find something. Not all monsters have to be scary, even if they might look and sound like it. The spookiest grin might belong to the nicest person.Children believe in magic. For them dreaming is the same as the waking world. The older we grow the more we start to lose this truth, but as long as we're still children, we remember. If we're lucky, we realize, at some point in our lives, that dreams are important, for they are hope. And hope is the thing that allows us to step out of our doors. But often we realize this too late, if at all.Trees can grow overnight into mighty giants. And the oldest trees have power of their own. Empty houses are never truly empty. It's nice to have a roadside roof to hold the rain, though umbrellas are mighty useful as well. Laughter keeps thunder from being too scary, every old lady should be called a grandma and the reason no adult believes in trolls is because they can turn invisible.All this I learned from My Neighbor Totoro.</fullReview>

But this thing is just brimming with heart. I was going to say the little sister (Mei) in her raincoat is the cutest thing ever, but that goes for all of her scenes. And Totoro, the eponymous no-neck cat/rabbit thing, while having no dialog, burst with likable personality. The animation here is nothing short of gorgeous. Even if you don't dig the character designs of Japanese animation, those painterly landscapes, clouds and lush greenery are eye-popping.It says a lot that MY NEIGHBOR TOTORO held my 5 year-old's rapt attention from start to finish. And this isn't short-attention-span fare. One of my favorite scene was the rainy bus stop. Very little happens here, but it's a terrific bonding moment between the main characters. You'll instantly see why Totoro with a leaf on his head is the film's iconic image.The movie's just an all-around winner, not much else to say. Precocious and full of wonder, it's like a shot of warmth to the ol' ticker.9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Adorable, Non-Obnoxious Kids' Film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With all the crude humor, fantasy violence, and bad jokes in recent kids films, it's nice to see one that has none of that. This is a sweet movie, with no violence and little scariness, and manages to (get this) be funny without people farting! Whaaaat?? Yes, it's possible! All the characters, even the ghostly soot sprites, are adorable and lively, and the whole movie gives off a magical vibe that other kids movies just don't. Totoro is literally the cutest thing I have ever seen, and the Bus Stop Scene is a must-see moment. Every scene is great! Whether you're 8, 18, or 48, you'll love this movie no matter what, with its adorable animations, wonderfully developed characters, and heartwarming conclusion, you'll be with this film from start to finish, and definitely want to see it again! It's cute, hilarious, and non-obnoxious. A great film!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I first saw this before Disney got their hands on the rights, and re-did the English dubs.Not to knock the Fanning sisters, but Disney ruined this title for me. After having the original DVD which was cracked, and replaced by the Disney re-master my family and I both felt it went waaay down in points.The original voice-overs, and dialog were magical! The remake changed a few things, and lost loads of emotion. Still a great movie; however, for us we found an original on ebay for some ridiculous amount like $60 USD, and bought it. Never looked back. Totoro is like a family member. We couldn't just leave him behind. Lol.__ Great movie. I give the original an 8.5 out of 10... My kids and I could not even sit through the Disney re-issue, because we missed the original VO so much.. They ruined it for us... for that reason I rate the Disney re-issue about a 5.7. Harsh, but true.!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is probably the simplest story I have ever seen in a movie, told in a way to be quite delightful. Lots of times where the silence or lack of music or dialogue lets the visuals speak for themselves. I usually prefer the soundtrack in the original language, but these voice actors were just perfect for the parts. The girls' boundless energy was infectious.This is not just a movie for young kids, although they will probably find it quite enjoyable. Adults can appreciate the youthful exuberance exhibited by the girls. There were lots of little touches that made it seem "real". I especially like the way they showed the odd way the boy was propelling the bicycle because he couldn't reach the pedals from the seat.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"My Neighbor Totoro" is a wonderful family film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Childhood is a blossoming period of learning and developing one's own idiosyncrasies. It has always been a sedate stage in which little youngsters define themselves through their senseless antics?ones that appear innocent but are of an elusive nature, and are merely an inadvertent expression of the capricious phase that is childhood. However, since kids are so full of youthful tendencies, very few directors have managed to portray the rascals in a sincere and realistic manner. But among those select few is an irreplaceable Ghibli film which has become a sensation both within its native community and the western world?and that film is Hayao Miyazaki's My Neighbor Totoro.My Neighbor Totoro is, simply put, a child's imagination brought to life; fanciful tales that become reality, replete with picturesque wonders that reveal the magical and mysterious. Hidden from adult eyes, the otherworldly rewards only those of pure heart. Spirits and mystic guardians of the forest, they embody the creativity and candidness of children?content to experience the simple joys of life and the beauty of nature. With down-to-earth characterization, Satsuki and Mei are splendid lenses into the film's world, their optimism and enthusiasm ensuring every little discovery resonates with the audience?a magical tale that is an adventure for kids, and an opportunity to revisit childhood for adults; a genuine moment of reflection.Although the setting lacks depth, My Neighbor Totoro alleviates this by deftly weaving together fantasy and realism. Very little is explained and detailed, but its integration of the imaginary is both natural and unobtrusive. A big house nestled amidst greenery, uninhabited for decades, a likely home to the mysterious. Satsuki and Mei, true to their age, are explorers of the unknown?their interactions with the rich environment are not only a delight to observe, but also a reflection of the curiosity inherent within every child.Unveiled with mystique, uncanny soot creatures emerge from the house's floor and scamper into the shadows as the heroines enthusiastically tour the dark rooms of their new abode. Even if slightly scared at first, Satsuki and Mei's fear quickly gives way to curiosity, then excitement, and finally delight. The two adventurous sisters stumble upon a new world, and like any child would, wholeheartedly embrace its magic. This very sense of wonder is what leads them to the mythical spirit Totoro, protector and guardian of the forest. Intimidating in size, but gentle in nature, the fuzzy giant embraces the two of them with otherworldly tenderness. In an ever-so-subtle way, he becomes a link between the characters and the forest itself, introducing them to many of its magic wonders.In essence, My Neighbor Totoro is more about inspiring one's imagination?an honest message about the importance of childhood and a connection with nature?than creating a fantasy backdrop. Complexity is absent, but the presentation is delivered with finesse and flair. Much of this is due to the laid-back pace and the amiable guidance of the protagonists, slowly hinting at the mysteries that may be hidden in the nooks and crannies of dark rooms and lush forests. All the viewer needs to do is to sit down, relax, and enjoy the magic unfold.Allowing their daughters the liberty to go and explore the surroundings of their new home, Satsuki and Mei's parents are often absent physically, but present in spirit. As caring guardians, the parents concern themselves with their troublesome daredevils in an earnest and honest fashion. These carefree dynamics connect the otherwise distant adult world with the children's, instilling a sense of trust and intimacy among the family. In this sense, Miyazaki makes a conscious effort of displaying human relationships in a sincere and natural style.True to Ghibli's reputation, My Neighbor Totoro's visuals are masterfully crafted with great attention to even the most minute details. Rich with body language and facial expressions, the screenplay succeeds in the art of showing and not just telling, breathing nuance and realism into the cast's actions and interactions. These subtleties add striking believability to the characters, as adults and children alike look and behave according to their ages. The physical environments, too, are vividly detailed, setting the stage for the integration of the cast and fantasy?be it the cluttered rooms of a house recently moved into, or the green vastness and richness of the countryside.Likewise, the film's sound department is remarkably well-polished. Joe Hisaishi's compositions harmoniously blend with the mood of the scenes?the tempo is upbeat in situations of excitement and discovery, while smooth when tension is low. The timing is delicate, but more than anything, the tracks themselves are what stand out most. Charming and varied, the melodic tunes make extraordinary scenes even more memorable. The careful management not only soothes body and mind, but also permits the soundtrack to lace key scenes with vivid and meaningful tonality. Interesting to note, though, is that for most of the movie, there is no background music. Instead, focus is placed on environmental sounds, allowing the countryside setting to weave its own atmosphere. In concordance with the naturalistic tone of the story, this adds a more organic touch to the presentation?one focused on painting nature in its purest form.A tale intended for kids, yet a journey fit for audiences of all ages, My Neighbor Totoro is a splendid story that encapsulates the beauty of childhood. The film's wonderful portrayal of Satsuki and Mei's imagination conveys a true sense of jollity present in most children. Beyond its realism, the film delivers a dazzlingly magical experience by way of its supernatural encounters with the manifestations of nature. But this occurs ever so gently, that one could consider it a dream-like tale that both begins and ends in blissful serenity. A true classic, My Neighbor Totoro will remain in the hearts of many as a heartwarming experience of one of the purest and most beautiful memories: a frolicsome childhood, never to be forgotten.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched Totoro after Spirited Away and is a little disappointed about this movie. The style of drawing is still warm and nice. But the plot is plain and predictable. The loveliness of Totoro is amazing but the way the story ends is no more than cliché. Totoro maybe the dream friend to girls like transformers to boys. The plump, cute and powerful holy friend just caters to girls' unrealistic imagination about someone that can protect her. Boys are crazy about transformers just the way girls fan Totoro. But one thing is different: with the accompany of bumblebee, boys are able to protect himself, his family and fighting against evil while girls keep wondering Totoro to take care of herself and fulfil some painstaking goals. However, Spirited Away encourage us to save the family and pursuit love, with some lucky help from lovely spirits.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When a man moves with his two young daughters(who are credible, with their child-like energy and their enthusiasm, that does give in to fear and doubt at times) to be closer to his hospitalized wife, the girls both begin seeing nature spirits. As they try to deal with their mother's illness, they experience amazing things with the imaginative creatures, including King Totoro, a large, fuzzy teddy-bear that smiles a lot and the many-legged Catbus. I suppose the main argument against this is the lack of real conflict(and without that, you don't really have a story), and the fact that the 10-year-old Satsuki(gesundheit) and the 4-year-old Mei can be rather obnoxious. Some will say that this doesn't need it; it's about the enchanting world(and it certainly is that). In addition to the magic, this does paint a convincing picture of the situation. This builds an atmosphere so effortlessly you barely believe it. The animation is smooth and "feels" real, including the setting of rural Japan, decades ago. There is a nice level of expression to the faces, especially the eyes. A cynic of many years, I will admit that this *did* win me over, yes, it is cute, the youngest of the 2 siblings is adorable(at times). There is some realistic kid dialog in this. The acting is great. If this does not tug at your heartstrings at least a bit, it may be time for a checkup. This is a truly well-done, sweet film that you can show children and they may love it, and it *isn't* pure garbage made with the sole intent being profit. There is nothing offensive in this. The DVD comes with a trailer for this, one for Kiki's Delivery Service and one for Howl's Moving Castle. I recommend this to any fan of fantasy. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Family-oriented Miyazaki tale and perhaps his most heartwarming story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hayao Miyazaki and his company Studio Ghibli are known widely as masters of sophisticated and creative hand-drawn anime, supreme imagination and heartfelt stories. "My Neighbor Totoro" is one of the first Miyazaki classics, ranking high in heart and animation but slightly lower on the fantasy end in comparison to his later work.Like many of his films, "Totoro" is set in the country. A young girl and her little sister move to a new home in the countryside with their dad while their mom is sick in the hospital. They come to believe their new home is haunted when the younger sister, Mei, discovers a forest spirit named Totoro, a large round creature resembling a bear with pointy ears and whiskers with an affinity for napping inside large trees."Totoro" is certainly the most child-friendly of Miyazaki's classics. There is no force for evil with the plot revolving around simple family drama. Only our curiosity at the world of forest spirits that Miyazaki withholds from us for so long in this film drives us to watch the entire thing. Sadly, this world does not blossom with imagination anywhere near the way it does in Miyazaki's later films. Totoro himself represents a source of comfort. For all intents and purposes he is merely an imaginary friend, a way for the girls to escape from reality and forget about their ill mother. A huge plus on the emotional side of things for this film, but not much good when it comes to filling our fantasy quota.The characters are some of the strongest people Miyazaki has ever created. The relationship between the two sisters holds the truth and humanity of the story. Even their father, who actually encourages their imagination instead of the expected "parent who tells them things aren't real" character archetype. The Disney English dubbing of the film does a terrific job in casting young Dakota Fanning and her sister Elle for the voice parts of Satsuki and Mei. Somehow in spite of their age they understand that these girls require a voice quality that it is much different from typical American children, for example. As siblings, this certainly made the connection between their characters even stronger."Totoro" has its classic scenes such as the one when Totoro shows up at the bus stop and Satsuki gives him her umbrella and when Mei chases some forest sprites into the woods, but the fantasy stops there. It simply is not integral to this story. "Totoro" is more of a country fairytale, something much different that the Disney cannon or the Wester cannon of children's stories and animation. It aims to tell a story of childhood and family with a slightly fantastical element to it rather than a wildly imaginative fantasy with family roots.~Steven CCheck out my site http://moviemusereviews.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Probably the definitive Hayao Miyazaki masterpiece.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My Neighbour Totoro is probably the film that introduced many western audiences to the work of esteemed Japanese animator/director Hayao Miyazaki and his celebrated production house Studio Ghibli. It is a film that I have fond memories of, having first discovered it as part of a mid-90's Sky Movies double (alongside my personal favourite Miyazaki film Porco Rosso) when I was around nine or ten years old. It stayed with me for many years before unavailability led me to record it off the TV sometime around 2001, where I found, much to my surprise, that the film was every bit as touching, endearing and enchanting as it had first seemed so many years before.Finally, some kind soul has decided to re-release all of the Miyazaki/Studio Ghibli productions as a collection of re-mastered DVD editions, including everything from his Lupin III instalment The Castle of Cagliostro to the more recent epic fantasy adventure, Howl's Moving Castle (2004), which, like almost everything that Miyazaki has been involved with before, offer us a series of intricate story lines, breathtaking visuals, memorable characters and a general approach to bold, imaginative, unique and utterly compelling family entertainment that will almost certainly appeal to anyone between the ages of eight and eighty (urgh, sorry for the cliché!!). My Neighbour Totoro remains, perhaps, the definitive Studio Ghibli production, with Miyazaki here perfecting the visual style that would subsequently become his trademark, as well as developing a number of thematic devices that would be further explored in later projects like Kiki's Delivery Service, Porco Rosso and Spirited Away.The story takes place in the rural Japan of the 1950's, where two young girls and their father move into an old house near the forest in an attempt to distract the girls from the absence of their mother, who is recovering from tuberculosis in a nearby convalescence home. Whilst exploring the forest, the two girls discover a family of "forest spirits", the biggest of which they christened Totoro (a mispronunciation of "tororu", the Japanese word for troll), who allows the two girls to partake in their nightly adventures. With the film, Miyazaki and his team create a depiction of the perfect summer and the power of imagination, as they use the two children to act as a representation for the audience. Mei, the younger of the two sisters, comes to represent the youngsters within the audience, as she approaches the Totoro characters with wide eyes and enthusiasm and generally accepts each of their adventures to be a continuation of her imagined child-like sense of fabrication. Satsuki, the older of the two girls, straddles the line between childhood and pre-teen adolescence. Her character is often more cynical and level-headed than her younger sister, and therefore she is the perfect representation for an adult audience who may need to put aside their own sense of scepticism when approaching a film that is so shameless magical.The story is fantastic, with Miyazaki allowing the action to unfold slowly... bringing the girls (and the audience) into the world of totoro slowly so that the introduction of the "soot spirits" and the mythical king of the forest doesn't seem too jarring when dropped into a film that evokes such a plausible and believable depiction of reality (as with all the films of Studio Ghibli, Totoro has an almost obsessive attention to detail, with the texture of the locations and the use of light and shadow drawing you further and further into the film as a whole). The atmosphere throughout is perfect, whilst the characters (both in design and portrayal) are excellent, with the two young girls setting the template for Miyazaki's aforementioned later films, Kiki's Delivery Service and Spirited Away, whilst the design of the mythical Totoro would become an important piece of iconography within Japanese animation (he's used as the Studio Ghibli logo, and is available in a range of plush-toy incarnations!!).As with the majority of Miyazaki's work, Totoro has deeper themes lurking beneath the surface of the story... Here, it is the idea of childhood and imagination (and really the power of imagination, which is central to all Miyazaki's work) being worn down by the approach of adolescence. It has also been seen as a metaphorical piece, with the relationship between the girls and Totoro being an imagined one in order to take their minds off the temporary loss of their mother and their concerns over her health (a factor that probably accelerates Satsuki's desire to grow up?). Whether or not you choose to interpret the story on such a level is entirely up to you, with the film working just fine as a lovely piece of family entertainment, with a warm and ultimately uplifting story being elevated by that gorgeous design/animation, the larger than life characters, and the story that manages to create fantastical characters and enchanting underworlds, without feeling the need to view them with a crass irony or an air of damaging cynicism (something that can't be said about the majority of Hollywood animation).My Neighbour Totoro is an exceptional film... one that has the power to enthral children and adults alike (another woeful cliché... but it's true!!!) with its evocative story, memorable characters and shades of hidden depth. If you've never seen a Hayao Miyazaki film before, then this is a great place to start, and is really an essential purchase alongside Porco Rosso, Kiki's Delivery Service, Spirited Away, and Howl's Moving Castle.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Tonari no Totoro" continues the glorious path of Hayao Miyazaki's animation features. "Totoro" is Studio Ghibli's oldest production and it was just released on DVD in Finland for the first time.I have always been a huge fan of Japanese animation. When I was a child my favorite animation feature told the story of a little orphan girl named Candy. The music in Miyazaki's pictures reminds me of Candy. Music plays an enormous role in Miyazaki's cartoons. It is very emotional and touching.In Finland there is always dubbed version but I always watch animations in their original language. Then a movie feels more authentic and real.In "Totoro" the plot is very simple but it emphasizes the importance of family. The relationship between the sisters Satsumi and Mei is so strong. Another interesting thing in Miyazaki's stories is that you never know what kind of creatures there is going to be this time. Totoro's character brings a little magic to the ordinary life.The movie can be recommended to all ages!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I first watched My Neighbor Totoro when I was around six or seven, and it remains to be in my top 3 favorite childhood movies. Even today, as a college student, I can watch it and shamelessly laugh and giggle along with Mei and Satsuki.The movie is set in a Japanese farming province around the early 1950's, without all the depressing post-war images and allusions that other movies set in this time make. Satsuki (10), Mei (around 5), and their father, a University Professor, have moved there seemingly to make life easier for their hospitalized mother, who is recovering from some undisclosed illness. There, Mei finds Totoro, a forest spirit who lives in the forest around their house.In my opinion, the best thing about this movie's staying power is that it can be viewed anywhere, by anyone, of any age, and there's nothing uncomfortable or over-cheesy about it. Also, it leaves lasting memories for anyone and, after watching it, gives you a light-hearted and innocent sense of hope.I highly suggest this movie; the 1993 version more so than the "remastered" 2005 version. It's more fun for children and a bit more whimsical over-all. I give the 1993 version a 10 and the 2005 version a 9.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think this piece deserves a 10 because it is a visual feast and it has some very cute &amp; cool fantasy characters. I am male in his late 20's, an animation lover and I loved every minute of it. You would like this if you like fantasy and/or spirituality, kittens, magic and nature. You must also not get easily annoyed by little girls with high voices. Of course you are open to Japanese customs (or else you wouldn't be reading about this Japanese movie). I think the main character Totoro looks cool by just doing nothing (don't worry, he'll do more). If you watch this with your kids, there might be a need for explaining some typical customs, especially when they watch the Japanese version and can't read all the subtitles fast enough. I recommend watching native versions of any foreign movie, that way nothing is lost in translation, arigato.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film was amazing. I don't know why it took me so long to view it. It joins Aladdin, the Lion King, and Spirited Away in the line-up of great children's flicks. This one just seemed to have so much warmth. I was smiling almost the entire time, wanting to be a kid again. Everyone should see this and remember just what being a kid is all about. It's great how Mei is afraid of Nanny at the beginning, but by the end treats her like her own grandma. Totoro is too cute. While not the centerpiece of the film, he sure does add a great touch to the film. I think this and Spirited Away are Miyazaki's best films, followed closely by Princess Mononoke. This is just such a gem of a movie. So many details make this movie even greater. I know everyone remembers running around in the beginning of the film like Satsuki, making the "Indian noises." This truly is a film that touches all ages.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Beautifully Imaginative Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In my mind, there are only two films that truly capture the essence of a child's imagination. One is Danny Boyle's vividly beautiful Millions, and the other is Hayao Miyazaki's sweet, tender, and utterly gorgeous My Neighbor Totoro.The story is of two young girls who move to the Japanese countryside with their father while their mother is being treated in the hospital. After settling in, these two children discover that where they live is anything but ordinary. They find a hidden path into the forest, and soon meet Totoro, a giant, furry, and lovable creature.The film is told strictly from the point of view of these two children. What adults may see as harmless and silly, the children see as amazing and very much real. When the children go on about how they can see "Soot Gremlins" and "Totoro", the adults simply say that they saw them when they were children as well.This formula is certainly one we've seen before, but thanks to the genius of Hayao Miyazaki, My Neighbor Totoro takes on a feeling of unbridled imagination never before seen on celluloid. The world he creates is an intimate yet expansive one. The fact that this is one of Miyazaki's most beautifully animated features certainly doesn't hurt this. Everything is gloriously vivid, colorful, and bursting with life.The manner in which Miyazaki presents the narrative is nothing short of brilliant. The whole time watching the film, we as an audience realize that the girls' mother is suffering from some kind of serious affliction, but this is never really addressed directly. The children don't think about it that way, so the film doesn't approach it that way. This subplot never really develops at all until a sequence near the very end of the film, and this is a very powerful sequence. In order to avoid spoilers, I won't reveal the details, but it certainly struck me with its bittersweet honesty. However, this is still a tender family film through and through, and the ending is one that is sure to bring a smile to your face. And unlike most family films, My Neighbor Totoro is sweet, but never reaches the point of being saccharine. It's an honest, beautiful masterpiece, and I give it my highest recommendation to anyone who can still manage to keep in touch with their inner child from time to time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Perhaps My Neighbor Totoro is a little slow moving by today's standards, but it has a magic that Disney's films can only wish for. Hayao Miyazaki and Studio Ghibli make animation you can get lost in. Highly recommended.Any of Miyazaki's other works are also worth checking out: Kiki's Delivery Service, Princess Mononoke, Spirited Away, etc.I think the reason I'm so drawn to Studio Ghibli's films is because Disney has created the "fomula animated feature" and polished it until I became utterly bored and cynical. Studio Ghibli's films are original and magical.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Break the classic element of movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many movies are somehow based on the classic conflict of Good vs Evil, even for 'innocent' movies like 'Finding Nemo', one of the main theme is to save Nemo from some bad guys.But in this movie, forget about the mad world and immense yourself in a small Japanese village, through the eyes of two kids. It is about their exploration with the surrounding and how they build bonds with the nature. This movie brings back the feeling of child-like curiosity, and one can spend days in playing with the flowers and other animals.And perhaps this is how children look at the world, always fun and curious. Now for the adults we somehow see the world as more black and white, good and bad, right and wrong. And I'm not sure who has a better perception about the reality :-)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I loved the film but know there are now three versions on video in the USA</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although so many reviews have been written here for the movie, I am including one because there are now 3 different video versions of this movie and all three are certainly worth watching.Originally in the United States, 20th Century Fox released the movie on video in the early 90s. This is the version I first saw. Then, a few years later, Studio Ghibli (who made this film in Japan) signed a deal for exclusivity with Disney. This has resulted in a more widespread release of their pictures but has also recently resulted in a new dubbed version of the movie. The Disney version has, perhaps, more realistic voices--as the children sound more like kids. However, I prefer the original voices--particularly the voice for Mei. I think it's the same lady who does the voice of Angelica on Rugrats.Finally, there is the original Japanese version that is subtitled into English. I am a bit compulsive and actually have seen all three versions! I think the subtitled is best because there are also a few tiny scenes that are in neither dubbed versions (not enough to change the story, but still I prefer a complete film). Of the dubbed, my loyalty is to the Fox version--it just sounds more charming and cute.Now about the movie itself, the animation is about the best you'll find anywhere--particularly the gorgeous backgrounds. They seem to yell out "QUALITY PRODUCTION" throughout. The story, though very simple, is very captivating and the emotional response the film triggers is amazing. Anyone (except a total curmudgeon) will love this charming and simple film. See the movie, as it's about as good an animated film as you can find--regardless of where it was made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My favorite Miyazaki film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A great and creative story. It is about two girls named Satsuki and Mei. Them and their dad move to the countryside. Their mother is in the hospital because of illness. They meet Granny, who helps them to move in the house and is a farmer. The reason that they moved there was because of a gigantic camfer tree.( which looks like about the size of the Empire State Bulding.) When they move in, they find dust bunnies, little creatures made of dust.(of course.) One day Mei Finds a little white thing that can turn invisible. Later, she sees a medium sized blue one with a sack of acorns. Then she goes into the forest and finds the large gray one. The totoros take the two on adventures, and help them deal with their mother in the hospital. A great film and is highly entertaining. In the beginning, the dialog is very annoying.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I cannot believe it took me around 6 years to finally get to watch this film (on an illegally imported Chinese version, no less). This is an amazing piece of animation, characters are so endearing and real, the story so magical, it takes me back to my childhood fantasies (yes I did fantasise about having a large owl/rabbit creature as a friend).I guess some may think of it as a children's cartoon, and children will definitely enjoy it, but adults can enjoy it just as much. I think this is Miyazaki's greatest work alongside the recent Spirited Away. Fantastic works they may be, but with just the right amount of personality mixed in that make them truly human films. I understand this and other Miyazaki's will soon be legitimately available on western shores this summer, a pity with the big name dubbing, but I guess it will make it more accessible to people, and that is good.I totally recommend this to anyone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Subtle and beautiful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the most beautifully crafted movies I know of. It's mostly cute and heartwarming -- funny forest spirits, kids, the Japanese countryside, happy family -- but underlying that are fears far more real and frightening than any bad guy Disney ever concocted: the ill mother, the endangered child. The main characters are two of the most believable kids I know of in cinema, and we see the world through their eyes: not only the magical worlds of imagination and nature, but also the presence of death and the fragility of happiness. Don't get me wrong -- it's a very, very happy movie -- but in spite of the wildly imaginative fantasy element, it's a believable happiness because of the other things it acknowledges. I don't know of another movie than manages to be so incredibly cute and kid-friendly and without compromising an ounce of artistic integrity.NOTE: I highly recommend AGAINST the dubbed version. The children in English are whinier and more stereotypical Hollywood kids; they lose some of the intelligence and depth that makes the kids so wonderful in Japanese. In some movies as visual as this one, the dub is preferable since it lets you focus on those visuals ... but not this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a most wonderful ode to nature and childhood</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having seen all of Hayao Miyazaki's films I think I can safely say that My Neighbour Totoro is his finest piece. It captures the wonder and magic of childhood and makes you cry with joy. Literally. The film tells the story of two sisters, Mei and Satsuki, who move into an old house in the Japanese countryside with their father, only to find it haunted with Soot Sprites. The girls' exploration of the neighbouring countryside leads them to Totoro, a giant furry, benevolent forest spirit. From then on it's pure adventure and laughter. Almost. Unlike nearly all other children's films, Totoro has no villain, no evildoer or wicked granny. Though Satsuki and Mei must face emotional hardship it is simply the hardship we must all face. Sickness and mortality.Though it's become a cliche, here it rings true; this film is for children all ages. I've shown this movie to all my friends: jaded and cynical film enthusiasts yet they all fall prey to this film's charm and sincerity. See it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautiful film for film-lovers or children</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a great film either for adults or adults looking for a great film for their kids to watch. Unlike other Miyazake films, Totoro is set in contemporary rural Japan, and aims at a younger audience. Like his other films, it is beautifully animated and scored, with an engaging and moving story line. It also centres on a strong girl heroine and a fantasy world. It also has the tightest plot structure of Miyazake's movies, which is to say, it lacks the complexity of his more adult-orientated works. Aside from the wonderful characters and sensitive story-line, it is a great glimpse into Japanese rural life, from roadside shrines to family bathing. It also beats Disney movies hands down for depth of characterization, mood and general quirkiness. And unlike Disney movies, it has a story, rather than a formula. The premise concerns a father and his two daughters who move into an old house while the mother convalesces in a nearby hospital. The story explores the emotions aroused by this move, adjustment to rural life and the mother's illness in an understated way. However, the real fun is the magical parallel world that the girls discover in their backyard.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was my introduction to anime. I first saw this movie in 1995. I loved it but forgot about it for quite a while. In 1999, Miramax released Mononoke Hime into U.S. theaters. I saw it three times during its theatrical run and six times on video. When I looked up Miyazaki's filmogrophy I saw that he directed Totoro. I knew that I had to see it one way or another. About four weeks ago I bought the import DVD and I watched it again. I fell in love with it again. It's probably the cutest movie ever. The creature Totoro is the best "cute-thing" ever to hit the silver screen. Mei and Satsuki are brilliant. If you don't have time to see the whole movie then just watch the bus-stop scene. Brilliant! You can never go wrong with Miyazaki. Disney (U.S.) could never get a project like this off the ground without screwing it up royally and adding musical numbers. EVERYBODY LOVES TOTORO!

		<fullReview>I saw this film for the first time on Japanese television a couple of years ago. This is one of the few feel-good films I ever saw that drove this normally left-brained engineer to a teary-eyed sentimentality. It is a story about two sisters, Mei and her elder sister Satsuki, who had just moved to a house in the country. Their father, a teacher, looks after them as their mother is ill in the hospital. While playing in the garden, Mei sees a strange furry character and takes after it. The events that follow lead her and Satsuki to a wondrous backyard adventure with magical creatures. Are they real? Imaginary? This film has a cuteness factor that runs off the scale. As it is with most Japanese films, it really needs to be seen in its original language form, subtitled if necessary, rather than the dubbed VHS and DVD forms available in the US.</fullReview>

That's because people in this film it's so real that you can feel the same they are feeling, and you can also believe in totoros. If you are a grown person like me, you'll remind the feelings of childhood and you'll understand that we used to be like these charming girls. And the frontier between fantasy and reality will become again thin like a hair. I love so much the scene when, in the night, the two girls and Totoro made to growth the tree... And in the morning there is a little plant... Dream? Reality? I know what I think, and you should discover watching this film ;)In conclusion: rather than a history, this film portraits a bit of life. It's more like music than like photography.</fullReview>

I was impressed at how dead-on the dynamics of sibling relationships were portrayed, especially in light of what the girls are dealing with. Indeed, the girls the kind of well-rounded characters you simply don't find in American cartoons. My 5 year old, a die-hard MIB nut who was convinced that he would hate it, was captivated from start to finish. If that's not reason enough to get it, then I don't know what is.</fullReview>

There is one scene, where the Totoros dance around a flower bed, where the girls had planted some accord seeds. The girls join the Totoros, in this childish dance to make the seeds sprout. To me as an adult, this was such an enchanting scene. To my children (3 and 4 years) it was magic, as we danced like the Totoros. The kids loved it, even not speaking English. I'd like to add a small detail, that can be seen on the DVD: the japanese version is full of silent scenes. In the dubbed version, those silences are almost always filled with some background dialogue. It doesn't spoil the dubbed version, but makes an interesting cultural detail.</fullReview>

It's designed in that way, and it's great in that way, so don't expect a great story because it hasn't it. If you want something "serious" go for Kokaku Kidotai, Hotaru no Haka (excellent), Nausicaa, Mononoke Hime (these last two by Miyazaki too) or even one of the Rupan Sansei (Lupin III) saga, instead.My rating: 9/10 (again, as a movie designed for children).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Non-Disney. Maybe that's why it's just so very good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Two things always come into my mind when I think of this movie. One is the pacing. And one is the clouds.Let's talk about the clouds first. They're really amazing. Whenever I look outside and see those same big, puffy, sunny-day clouds, I always tell my kids, "Those are Totorro Clouds." This is of course just one example of the amazing drawing and animation in this movie. Beautiful interior shots with amazing detail. Great drawings of people, although I'll never understand why anime always includes the huge round eyes and the cavernous mouths. There's the one scene where the tree grows all the way up to the sky. All hand drawn, it compares favorably to the best computer-assisted animation by Disney, Dreamworks, or the rest. It's just simply beautiful.Now on to pacing. The thing that really amazes me about this movie (and the thing that makes it superior to the other movies by this director) is that it is such a small, simple little story. Two young girls, ages about 4 and 7 I'm guessing, go out to the country with their father to be near their seriously ill, convalescing mother. Because of their stress, it seems, they meet some comforting mythological creatures who give them a ride around and then take them back home. That's about it.There are long, drawn-out scenes in the kitchen and in the family bath that you'd never catch in a Disney film. The most beautiful scene of all is that of the two girls waiting at the bus stop for their father to come home from work. They must wait on screen for at least a few minutes. It's astonishingly shocking and effective in its lack of activity. American filmmakers, who are always claiming that their animation is not just meant for children, still feel the need to pack every second of their movies with nonstop noise and action. Totorro, on the other hand, has the pacing you'd hope for if you moved out to the country. It's a simple, melancholy little film that just strikes me as so damn true to life.I've got plenty of younger friends who are totally into the more hardcore anime, like Akira and Ghost in the Shell. I always tell them to watch this movie. Now they're all fans as well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was both of my children's favorite movie as kids! So I thought I would surprise my 20 year old with the new Disney version for his birthday. Big mistake! They re-did everything. They performed the notorious Disney cutting of the film they're famous for when given foreign animated films. Eliminating scenes all throughout the movie, or just cutting scenes shorter. All the voices were redone horribly. The two young girls who were tasked to re-perform the voices of the two main characters sucked. Every change was pointless and brought the movie down. The original American version of the film done by Fox, I would rate it a 10/10 as a movie your children can enjoy and love. The new "remastered" Disney special edition I would give a 5/10. They really did that much damage.I sold the new version and went on ebay and bought the original. If you haven't seen this movie before, please buy the original!

		<fullReview>My Neighbour Totoro is one of the most enchanting films that I've seen. As one would expect from a film made by Hayao Miyazaki the animation is beautiful and detailed and the story engrossing.The film start with a man and his two young daughters, Satsuki and Mei moving to a house in the country. When the girls explore the house they find strange creatures that look like tiny black fur balls which scurry away as soon as anybody enter the room. While Satsuki is at school Mei sees a strange little creature, about the size of a rabbit, in the garden and chases it into the forest, here she finds a similar creature which is much larger. She names them "Totoro", which I believe is a slight mispronunciation of the Japanese word for a troll.When here father and Satsuki find her sleeping in the woods we are left unsure whether it was real or whether Mei had dreamt it. Not long after while waiting at the bus stop in the rain Satsuki also sees Totoro as he is waiting for his bus... not just any bus though, he rides in the Cat-bus, a wonderful eight legged creature who's eyes are its headlights.This film is suitable for people of all ages, there is no antagonist and the only slight worries are when Mei gets lots while trying to walk to see her mother who is in hospital.This comment was based on watching the film in Japanese with English subtitles, I've only seen a little bit of it in English but what I saw gave me no cause for complaint.</fullReview>

But this movie is most heart-warming one of his works. I would like to tell you why. First of all the story is almost realistic. In other words, it is about our ordinary life. We can see Japan's typical countryside and an ordinary life whenever we see the film, we feel peaceful. For even those who live in a big city, the movie might have relaxation effects? Second its music and pictures are very enchanting. Maybe almost all the Japanese know "Sanpo" -Totoro's theme song- the song is very very famous. It always makes us happy.The pictures are also popular. All characters have tender facial expression. I love their smiles. Everyone like them, don't they? Third, There are many silent without conversation. In such a scene, I can hear the song of birds, sounds of wind. I feel comfortable and calm .It is really Miyazaki's world. This movie will give you gentle, comfortable and calm mind. I can recommend this movie to everyone. Particularly I want to recommend this movie to those who are busy everyday.

		<fullReview>Tonari no Totoro is a marvelous movie. We can learn a lot about relationships between human life and nature from this movie. Totoro is a forest spirit. When Mei tries to go to hospital that her mother was in, She gets lost. Satsuki is worried about Mei. Totoro kindly helps them. The scene in which the forest spirit helps humans is superb. Totoro also presents a gift to Satsuki and Mei to thank her for her father?fs umbrella. It was a package wrapped up in bamboo leaves and tied with dragon whiskers. The substance is magic nuts and seeds. I would like to be given the some gift from Totoro. I watch Disney's Lilo and Stitch too. Tonari no Totoro and Lilo and Stitch films are different though they are both family animation. Lilo and Stitch is a more realistic film than Totoro. Stitch is an alien who causes many trouble at every place. And Lilo isn't childlike as Mai. Both at these films are interesting. But, I like Tonari no Totoro better than Lilo and Stitch. Because Tonari no Totoro gives us a lot of dream. For example, a Cat bus which Totoro carry Mei and Satsuki is really impressive. After seeing this movie, I realize we should protect nature in which Totoro can have a happy life. I rated this movie at 9/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a film of Studio GHIBLI. That is the most famous animation company in Japan and the company is known by all over the world. The story line of the film is so simple; MEI goes to her mother, but she gets lost, then her sister SATHUKI asks a big monster to find her sister MEI, and finally she is found. Like this, this film has so easy story lines as the long movie, however you can see this move many times. In this film, the sound and picture make it possible. In picture, the palace which MEI finds the big monster is in tree. There is so mysterious place which is surrounded green. And their house is a so interesting which you may fell nostalgia, although you have never been to there. And when the character is in intense, the sound make the seen more intense furthermore. When the mysterious seen, the sound adds more mysterious image furthermore. The music was made by HISAISHI JO. Please be careful when the MAKKUROKUROSUKEs go away from the leading character's house to somewhere. The scene expresses us the way of the thinking of the director, MIYAXAKI HAYAO, about view of the film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Satsuki and Mei move to countryside with their father. This area has a wood, Totoro, a ghost or monster, stay there. Mei finds Totoro and they exchanges. Satsuki also find Totoro. Satsuki and Mei are helped by Totoro several times. This story is that the sisters' contacts with Totoro.What impressed me in this movie was that this movie doesn't many dialogue. On other hand, sound effects are various and cute, I think. Sounds of running Satsuki and jumping Totoro are cute and funny. These are effective in bringing out an attraction of the animated cartoon. Moreover, Mei's voice and portrayal are very cute and just a little child so darling.This movie released in 1988. After about 30 years, we can get friendly with Totoro and Totoro is famous and popular even now. I think the reason why this is so popular is simple development of story and charming characters. This movie made me happy and cheerful.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of my favorites!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was my kids' introduction to Hayao Miyazaki and studio Ghibli, and has remained one of our favorites for over twenty years. It follows sisters Mei and Satsuki on their exploration of the countryside and discovery of all of its inhabitants. I love how the father encourages the girls' imaginations and even plays along. I am lucky to have a pre-Disney copy, as I feel Disney completely ruined the character of this film. Cheryl Case (Angelica from Rugrats) is perfect as Mei in the original English version, and Lisa Michaelson does a great job bringing Satsuki to life. In my opinion, the Disney version falls flat. If Disney's version is the only one you've experienced, look for the original, I think you'll like it better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Everything is magical when you're a child. A gust of wind over a grassy meadow, a giant conifer reaching to the sky, tadpoles swirling in a puddle, a brand new house to run through and explore. Life is new, exciting, and mysterious.My Neighbor Totoro is a film that perfectly captures the wonder and beauty of life as seen through the eyes of a child. This is Hayao Miyazaki at his most restrained. In the broad scheme of his filmography, it is a distillation of everything that makes his work so effective and beloved: stunningly authentic character animation brimming with personality, gorgeously detailed settings and landscapes, and an ability to capture the magic in the small, inconsequential moments of life. We follow Satsuki and Mei, two young sisters who have moved with their father to a new house in an idyllic rural village. It is soon revealed that the purpose of this move is to be closer to their chronically ill mother who is staying in a nearby hospital - a detail which gains significant weight with the knowledge that Miyazaki's own mother spent a lot of time in the hospital with tuberculosis when he was a child. Although their mother's illness does loom over the film and is a crucial grounding element, it is relatively distant and far from its focal point. Instead, the meat of the film is simply Satuski and Mei exploring their new home and surroundings, assimilating to life in a new town, and, of course, meeting Totoro and friends. Totoro and his companions are the "spirits of the forest", as the girls' father puts it. He can't see them, nor can any of the adults in the film. For Mei and Satsuki, though, they are very much alive and real. Totoro acts as a personification of the aforementioned magic of nature and life. He's what makes acorns sprout into trees and propels the wind over the plains. Of course Mei and Satsuki can see him - for them, the wonder and awe of life is still fresh and exhilarating. And even though their father may not physically see these creatures as he works by candle light amidst a mess of papers and books, he seems to remember a time when he did. He nurtures the wonderment that his daughters feel and vicariously experiences it through them, as do we.All Miyzaki films have an environmental theme and display a fond respect for nature; here, it's reverential. Wind rushes over the grassy farmland, butterflies flutter in and out of frame, a snail inches slowly up the stem of a flower, a toad crawls along a dirt road in the middle of a rainstorm, a fish bobs to the surface of a pond setting small ripples in motion which radiate away. Miyazaki hangs over each of these moments and makes it impossible not to experience their simple beauty as the girls do.This is the essence of My Neighbor Totoro. It's a simple, humble, and reflective film free of sensory excess, antagonists, or even a traditional plot. It merely sets out to magnify and bask in the magic of life which becomes all too muted as you age. "I could see them too, when I was young", states a warm, elderly neighbor of the girls. With this film, you might yet again.</fullReview>

The music in my Neighbour Totoro was also great. I was just a little sad that this film was as short as it was. Totoro is such a great character that it would have been nice to learn more about him.

Its about two sisters, who have this awesome dad and a sick but loving mother and how these two sometimes float into this mythical world where various nature spirits exit. One of the things i noticed was that the creators have given crucial amount of time to make the movie detailed. Like when one of the sisters trip and fell, they have dirt on their knees when they rise, like how strikingly similar features these sisters have like their parents. Watching this film, i had a smile on my face all the time.

		<fullReview>Original Score: 4/4, Magnificent Movie. Movie: ***** (5/5), Quality: ***** (5/5) A kid's movie, this one is. And it is both an emotional, joyous, and entertaining journey throughout. An adventure of two young girls with the forest spirits nearby their new home in the mountains that they have just moved into. An adventure that is both universally appealing and sentimental to the viewer. Yeah, I'd dare say that there are almost absolute zero "guilty pleasures" here. Mm, so now you know how much I hated some "guilty pleasures" that some films may show, especially the world of anime's many "Sexualized" female characters and stuff like that. Jiminy Crickets! No wonder Hayao Miyazaki hates the anime industry. That's why his, and certain other anime works, are what I would consider the Lotus Flowers within a Pond of Dirt and water.The opening alone will have you enthralled within the film's emotions, with a song (Even if I had almost no idea what the lyrics mean.) that resonates with the emotion of happiness, is combined with an inventive sequence of creative, both unfamiliar and familiar creatures that move in harmony alongside of the song. Even then we are not introduced to the characters of the show just yet. That, was the simultaneously entertaining and engaging, happy moments that we should treasure. So, those of you who have already seen it, did you feel the happiness, joy and emotion within both the opening and throughout the film? I did, and I realize that kids would love it, a lot.We follow the Kusakabe Family as they move to the mountains, where they will be staying at an old, wooden house. The Kusakabes seems excited about it, especially the Kusakabe Children, Satsuki and Mei Kusakabe. What we see on screen, don't forget, is animation. Note something, all of the sound editing of animation, and not to forget to mention the vocal work, has to be manually recorded and synchronized. But that's not my main point here, isn't it? Sorry. I got a little carried away. Anyway, keep listening, because I'm gonna tell you something about the vocal work. It's something? Happy. Yes, happy. The two Kusakabe Sisters have fun around the house, and they enjoy themselves. Well, are you enjoying yourself, too? If the movie asked me that question, I'll answer yes, I did, and without much "Guilty Pleasures" either. Note the laughter and happiness within the vocal performances. While I have seen it many times as a kid, most of those viewings I was watching a dubbed version and not the original Japanese sound recordings. I'd noticed that the dub(Cantonese dub, not so sure who.) added a lot of extra voices that were absent in the original Japanese sound recordings. When it comes to dub or sub, best is to watch the original sound recordings with the subtitles of your choice. The Dub's good, too. But take note of certain things, the info of which you can find in this paragraph itself, for I have just said that in an earlier section of this paragraph. But personally I think watching the original Japanese Sound recordings is better, but English Dubbing can help break pass language barriers, though. I read the subtitles because I wasn't trying to enjoy myself, but to analyze the film itself and it's quality.I have heard some people describe this movie as "The Happiest movie ever made." . That can be said, and I quite agree with the statement for various reasons. For one thing, I did say that this movie is devoid of any "Guilty Pleasures" , didn't I? What I didn't mention yet is that this film is also devoid of any exaggerated drawings that the world of anime is full of. Those I mean the exaggerated drawings of human beings, especially the Sexualized Women. That's the kind of stuff that relates to "Fan-Service" isn't it? Well, get those things out of that particular anime and you'll have a clean, pure anime. This one, is one that is mostly suited to realism, with a bit of the ingredient of Fantasy mixed in. I'm glad that there is no smoking, or violence, or language, or bloody images, or disturbing images and any of that adult stuff within. With this statement? Means that, similar to Toy Story (1995), this film can be classified as one of the greats of kid movies, one that all kids can relate with and enjoy.The music and sound editing paces alongside with the action of the characters, evoking a unique feeling that captures our emotions, as well as entertains us audiences. It is a story both about the girls's adventures with the forest spirits and everyday life. I've seen it so many times as a kid, though I never did understand what the film was about till I became someone interested in the movies myself. It entertained me and amazed me every single time when I saw it as a kid. Now, returning to the film as a young adult, I felt that the film has the power to appeal to a universal audience. "Great storytelling, happy, funny and some sentimental moments, breathtaking sceneries of nature, it is universal, lyrical, and sentimental.". Glad that there wasn't any adult content within. I mention this because in some of the other Miyazaki films, there is smoking. I hated smoking, and if I hold one in my hand, I'd crush it to bits.You'd see the fantasy unfold in front of the screen, with a bit of astonishment, surprise, fantasy, emotion and laughter along the way. And the music (Or Sound Editing) that accompanies that particular scene will enrich the experience.The Movie, at 86 minutes long, it is still a very emotional and a great Children Fantasy film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sweet, enchanting, heart-warming movie.A father moves himself and his two young daughters, Satsuki and Mei, into an old run-down house in the country in order to be closer to his ailing wife, who is in hospital. Neighbours claim that the house is haunted and pretty soon it looks like they might be correct... Then one day Mei wanders into the forest and discovers an interesting creature, Totoro...The first and, so far, only Hayao Miyazaki movie I've liked, and I've seen all six of his movies that are in the IMDb Top 250. Generally his movies start well, with an intriguing, imaginative set up. However, they tend to quickly degenerate into a rambling adventure for a plot with random action scenes and equally random solutions to problems, and no character depth or engagement. Pretty much suitable for kids only.However, My Neighbour Totoro is different. There's no rambling adventure or random action scenes, but a sweet, focused story. The characters have depth and are likable and engaging. The plot develops gradually and meticulously. There's a beautiful child-like sense of discovery and wonder to the movie.Nice, emotional ending too.Kids will love it but it is ideal for all ages.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really like how the movie managed to be so fascinating. It's timeless considering that what it shows doesn't really get confined into a certain time period. Children's imagination will still exist as there's still children, although provided that they are well brought up. It's a very nice movie to keep a copy of, just to show your kids how to have fun outdoors and let their imagination thrive, instead of playing with the electronic gadgets and get cooped up indoors like many kids do these days. The movie doesn't show any hostility, although it shows real kids' bickering. The characters are soothing to the mind of the audience, who may just got bored of having to face shady people in real life. I am lucky to get a copy with the Japanese original voice. The voice work really is an integral part of the mood building.</fullReview>

Its simple to understand yet its extremely unique and is absolutely adorable. The characters are perfect and the casting for them is spot on (I've only seen it in the English dubbed version). The plot is neat in that you would think the movie revolves around just Totoro but the majority is the mother being sick and Mei running away which I find kind of interesting even though more Totoro scenes would have been fantastic. Either way, Its still a great movie and is one of my favorites. If you love Studio Ghibli or any fantasy movies in general you will for sure love My Neighbor Totoro.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Simply enchanting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The original Japanese audio is imperative to My Neighbour Totoro and I highly recommended it. Not that the English dub isn't sufficient (Ghibli films tend to attract a certain amount of care), but it doesn't do justice the lovely representation of childhood and innocence that the master Miyazaki conjures here. The sisters Satsuki and Mei discover these dust bunnies, little black fluffballs with tiny legs and eyes (this design later revisited in Spirited Away), and they may exist or not, but the adults in their father and Granny certainly indulge them. They delight in this discovery of their 'haunted' house and scream out shrilly and cackle for the bunnies in a way that only the original Japanese can fully justify. And in the animation their eyes grow wide and their grins grow massive - even more massive than say, the arguing men in Castle in the Sky, and that is truly a mark of great emotion when considering Miyazaki's work. That is again revisited in the bathing scene amidst a harrowing storm, where the father ushers in this silliness and over the top laughter to scare away the evil spirits. He's a thoughtful and caring and accommodating character like so few fathers in fiction are today - he isn't the problem, but his career and absence merely a symptom of life. Hisaishi's lovely track "Obake Yashiki" (or Haunted House) aids this discovery process; the eager plucks of the synthesizer create such a nervous excitement and curiosity that Satsuki and Mei clutch with their hands and eagerly embrace. I am reminded of this same track being used in this Chinese cartoon from my childhood, about a similarly gigantic tree amongst small trees in peaceful serene forest, until loggers arrive. But within those moments of pure delight in their childhood there is a significant blemish, their mother's illness which continually keeps her in hospital. The film does not focus on her plight as some sort of impending doom, but rather its implications and effects on the rest of the family. It is simply a fact of life. And so Satsuki has been forced into a role older than her years, a motherly comfort for Mei when she sulks and cries. She is, because of the unfortunate circumstances, pushed into the brink of adulthood. So it is the singular Mei who discovers the Totoro creatures, in a very delightful sequence where the white bunny-like one nervously rushes ahead and out of her eager palms. When she indignantly claims that she is not lying about her encounter (after the hilarious incident with the bushes), the adults nod in agreement after initially laughing at her. But Satsuki is also swept up in these tales, because even for her remarkably maturity, she collapses from things asked of her that are beyond what a little girl should be forced to face. And so we have two girls who are devoid of parental attention, and in this they find comfort and serenity in Totoro's adventures, playfully imitating Hisaishi's title theme with recorders atop the gigantic mystical tree.My favourite segment has to be the middle part where the two sisters go to the bus-stop with an umbrella for their father. Miyazaki lets us experience the rain and cold and impatience they feel, but it isn't sinister for no good reason. The giant Totoro joins them, and without a second thought Satsuki offers her the black umbrella, leading to the iconic and strange composition of the pair waiting in the rain for a bus, each with their own way of brandishing the umbrella. And sound design is used so weirdly and wonderful to establish Totoro as a gentle and mysterious giant; the heavy drop of rain that splatters against the umbrella, coupled with the adorable animation of the hairs standing up to attention and the wide lopsided grin. That grin is later copied by perhaps the strangest creature of them all, the cat-bus, with its multiple rapid legs and its pair of rats illuminating its destination. When its door magically widens, we hear a peculiar metallic sound effect, the only ones apart from the sisters to witness this. The magical friendship here is strengthened, though we are still somewhat baffled and amazed. My Neighbour Totoro is an extremely poignant and magical and strange exploration of the sort of childhood curiosity and imagination that children, but in particularly these two, can conjure. They play their recorders atop the giant tree, but it vanishes in the morning. Do they weep and moan? No, they rejoice and dance, imitating the same movements from last night to urge the little seedlings to burst forth once again. It's not the sort of tale that is ramped up to the extremities to promote some internal change - we get an inkling that is already happening with Satsuki, but it's not something that she is entirely ready to handle. And that's okay. Are these forest spirits a coping mechanism, or a fantastic comfort in a world that's a little scarier each time the sisters are told that their mother will not return home quite yet? Many films would have the children approach from a distance, cautious and apprehensive. The father, upon hearing of such a creature, would cynically berate such lies and establish himself as a sort of antagonist, but more importantly as an adult. Miyazaki makes the children squeal in delight and chase after such creatures. The father beats his chest in the most absurd way and cackles madly with his daughters. And later a weeping Satsuki collapses into the chest of Totoro, clearly overwhelmed by the burdens thrust upon her. She finds comfort and assistance. Everything will be okay.</fullReview>

It is centered around two young sisters trying to cope with moving into a new house and their mother in hospital when they find a friend in Totoro and his little woodland friends. It has so much imagination and is wonderfully done and although it has a mystical and magical feeling in essence it is all about the two sisters and their struggle to come to terms with their mother being ill, living in a place they don't know and their Father trying to cope alone.It is worth watching as it is a timeless classic for all ages, children will love Totoro whilst adults will appreciate the underlying message Miyazaki is trying to put across. 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sometimes You Have to Laugh for Problems to Go Away</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"There are dark dust bunnies all over the top floor!" "Just laugh, they are scared of us laughing." ?Mei and an old lady, My Neighbor TotoroThere are a lot of amazing movies that address a variety of different topics. Some, like American Sniper, talk about patriotism; some, like Now You See Me, question the perception of reality. These movies may be entertaining and great to watch; however, they will never be good enough to remain in memory of an audience for decades. Only a few, unique movie titles will be able to survive through time and remain in the history of cinematography as unique works of art. What makes these masterpieces so distinct is their ability to point directly to the heart of an audience and make each individual question his or her life rather than philosophically think about the world. My Neighbor Totoro could definitely be considered as one of these masterpieces. The movie's uniqueness lies in the ability to make adults feel young again; this allows My Neighbor Totoro to treat the audience of all ages in the same way. Hayao Miyazaki desired his work to convey the importance of fighting one's fears and helping each other. These lessons are equally important for children as well as adults. From the very beginning the movie grabs the audience's attention by the relations between two girls. Film critique Roger Ebert writes:"...it would never have won its worldwide audience just because of its warm heart. It is also rich with human comedy in the way it observes the two remarkably convincing, lifelike little girls" (2). These sisters show us an absolutely selfless love that is not based on any material benefit. They seem to be two perfect children that play with each other outside and do not care about any of the troubles of an outside world. Mei and Satsuki support each other despite everything and, above all, they never question each other's loyalty. Such a good pair of heroes makes every adult think about his or her childhood. As the author of article from EmpireOnline states, "Totoro's an out-and-out joy to watch, a subtle, atmospheric slice of childhood, perfectly capturing the naivety, the delight, and the mystery that is part of being a child" (60). The movie reminds an older audience of times when they were young. There were no responsibilities, all the friendships seemed eternal, and there was no reason to worry about anything other than boogeyman in the closet or health of loved ones. For the vast majority of an older audience the movie brings these vivid images back and lets them feel young again despite the fact that they most likely are already having children with whom they are watching this movie. The major topic of My Neighbor Totoro is fears and the ways to fight them. It seems to be traceable throughout the entire movie. Whether it is the fear of darkness and evil spirits or the fear for the parents, My Neighbor Totoro exposes it and shows that it may not be that scary after all. As the girls move into the haunted house, the only way to get rid of evil spirits is simply to laugh. This may sound weird and strange at the first thought; however, surprisingly, something as simple as laughing does indeed do a great job in getting rid of fears. Moreover, the elder audience may see this as a metaphor in a way. It is almost as if Miyazaki himself tries to tell us that the best way to approach the problems is to face them head on and not to be afraid of anything. This is especially seen when the girls find out that their mother will not come back home on the weekend; they got afraid for her health. Everyone who was at the point of knowing that his or her loved ones are in danger has experienced such an awful feeling. The scene shows that it is normal to be afraid for someone's health. Moreover, the movie shows the audience that they are not the only ones out there and there is always someone who would be willing to help. Totoro symbolizes this selfless friendship and empathy that people need when they face the challenges. As a movie reviewer White denotes about My Neighbor Totoro, "It doesn't use denial as a blanket. It presents a real world scary scenario, with the comfort being imagination and magic. We can get through anything with the right friend". In addition, there is a large emphasis on not giving up and fighting the fears or problems despite everything. This is the reason why Mei decided to run and visit her mother on her own. Had she not done this, there would have been no reason for Totoro to come and help her. Through this Hayao Miyazaki teaches the audience that problems and fears may not be that easy to overcome; however, there is always a need to fight. My Neighbor Totoro is a unique work of art not only due to the fact that it addresses inner problems of the audience but also because it unifies the audience of all ages. It shows us that despite the age, we may not be different after all and adults may learn from kids as much as children may learn from adults around them. Of course, there have been other movies that addressed the exact same topic and even attempted to relate to the audience in the way My Neighbor Totoro did; however, they lack that unique feeling of childhood in them, the one that makes us want to watch Miyazaki's masterpiece over and over again and attempt to learn more from it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Untapped Imagination</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think everyone can enjoy a good family film every once in awhile, especially when it's directed by the genius Hayao Miyazaki. He always finds the right mix of fantastical imagination with real heartwarming material. While I think My Neighbor Totoro is a good film, it's nowhere near his best. It explores the relationship between big and little sister, but also people dealing with a difficult situation in life. And sometimes that's when your imagination is at it's highest.It starts off pretty slow, and we don't actually get to see Totoro for about 20 minutes, but when we do the film takes a big jump in quality. A child's imagination is something that is only understood if you have had the same imagination at some point in your life. I remember the days of pretending I had other friends and creatures who would join me on my own adventures. So I can definitely relate to Mei and Satsuki. I think a better film for this would probably be Spirited Away, but it's nonetheless an enjoyable ride. The last 15 minutes or so are really touching. I loved all of the family moments, including their forest family.So Miyazaki has another heartwarming animated feature to his repertoire, but it falls short of the greatness of Spirited Away or even Howl's Moving Castle.+Touching +Imaginative +Totoro is so welcoming -Slow start -Could have been even more fantastical 7.0/10</fullReview>

They befriend O Totoro, the biggest and eldest Totoro, who is also the king of the forest. As their girls' mother lies sick in the hospital, O Totoro brings the sisters on a magical adventure but also helps them to understand the realities of life. My Neighbor Totoro (or Tonari no Totoro ) is a anime film with: No scary monsters, no villains, no evil adults and not like the other three act structure, and that could surprise a lot of people who are expecting the same third act in animated movie. This movie was beyond loved for being the best animated film ever made and that's from die hard fans of Hayao Miyazaki and moviegoers everywhere, and I can see easily see why, because this movie in opinion is one of the most griping, beautiful and the most stunning anime that actually give me butterflies deep inside of movie, and that's rare for me.This may sound over the top or over doing it but I don't Hayao Miyazaki is a god of anime and storytelling to the big screen. I only seen some of Miyzaki films but after watching spirited Away and this movie I want to more of this guys work, I found out that Hayao Miyazaki last film was The Wind Rises which I need to watch sooner or late, but it's a same to hear that, but the good things must come to a end. I absolutely loved the animation in this film, I mean how can put it into words without messing up my words. It's better to watch and experience the creative animation standing out from any other animated films, and just let the wonderful character's that are fully of joy and life can easily win you over by the first sentence.For problems... I don't have any, yeah no problems with this film. I was glued in by the world that Miyazaki created. I was locked in from start till the very end.Overall My Neighbor Totoro is different and the film doesn't shy away from that, it's a brilliant film and it's more then a kids film even adults can dig this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Studio Ghibli rule</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've seen 4 Studio Ghibli films now (This, Spirited Away, Princess Mononoke and The Wind Rises) and they are miles ahead of DreamWorks and nearly every other animated studio. Their films are just as visually stunning as the CGI ones and uniquely magical. My Neighbour Totoro is another enchanting film about 2 girls making friends with the forest spirits and having various adventures. MNT is widely regarded as one of the best animated movies ever and it should be. It's not as good as the other Ghibli films I've seen. It's very short and there's not that much of a plot. Therefore, it feels slighter and briefer than the others. There is a slight lack of structure. Those shortcomings demote it from a five star movie to a four star one, but there's plenty to love about this movie. The visuals are great and there is a real sense of wonder and amazement. It's colourful, dazzling and the anime looks just as realistic as Pixar's animation does. Hayao Miyazaki is pretty much the current ruler of animation, and only Walt Disney can rival him in the animated world.MNT is a very soulful and sweet movie that feels genuinely magical and enchanting. Various scenes such as the bus stop and the cat bus are awe inspiring and wondrous, and the script has plenty of sentiment but feels genuine and charming. This is a film where only the most cynical and hardened film viewers will dislike it, as the film has likability and charm in spades. This children's film lacks what many children's films are sorely lacking: A sense of innocence and elegance. It may not be the best movie by Studio Ghibli but it has some of the most memorable moments from their filmography and some of their best images. The forest spirits are beautifully designed and there's good reason why a Totoro toy appears in Toy Story 3. This is a more relaxed picture from Miyazaki and while his other movies have their frightening bits this is pretty much devoid of them. A delightful animated movie with plenty of sparkle and dazzle. Younger audiences will be enthralled, but it'll speak to adults as well.8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Extraordinary animation of Hayao Miyazaki. Among other adjectives accompanied by timely exclamation points can list: magic, tender, deep, fun, painful, contagious, provocative, beautiful ... It is amazing how in Tororo are even more evident the unique qualities that only genius artists can achieve. Here the magic is deeply linked to the forces of nature, and everything that fascinates can also at the same time scare. Besides the unique look (in its simplicity) and intense charisma (especially the Tororo own and younger sister Mei), the Ghibli studios once again touch on complex issues like loss and accountability, without sacrificing poetry, and especially unrestrained imagination. For those who coast cartoons, and art in general, we have a legitimate representative of a flawless and unforgettable work.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Honestly, I am a little constrained to review this film as it is the trademark film of Studio Ghibli. This film is constantly regarded as one of the best animated film in the world and the company even have Totoro as its company logo. There is so much love for this film and it certainly has large following.However, I will review equally as usual and I hope I won't be misunderstood in any way - I love this film.My Neighbor Totoro (1988) is a lovely film. It is imaginative yet so realistic in a way so original that its naivety and novelty still captivates its audiences to date although decades has passed. It preaches us to believe and respect the nature and spiritual world. It is charming.Aside from being light-hearted most of the time, this film is also comical. I certainly smiled at several points of the film while they adapt country side life because the characters are adorable and I absolutely loved the y&#x14d;kais created by the director especially Totoro and Susuwatari. You have no idea how much I loved supernatural and mythical creatures, fictional or not &#x2665;On the other hand, if I am to choose the best 1980s animated feature film from Studio Ghibli, I would certainly go for the lesser known film Grave of the Fireflies (1988) though. This is because of its powerful impact and I also liked Setsuko more than Mei. Spare me, Totoro's fans. *&#x571f;&#x4e0b;&#x5ea7;*Nonetheless, if you have not watch this film, you should and you will also be able to find out why My Neighbor Totoro (1988) has charmed thousands of fans worldwide!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Magnificent Caphor Tree</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Similar to "Sen to Chihiro no kamikakushi" (2001) in premise and "El espíritu de la colmena" (1973) in its depiction of childhood imagination, Miyazaki's "Tonari no Totoro" (1988) succeeds in blending the Japanese folklore and warm childhood summer nostalgia, the unattainable freedom of youthful imagination and hope, and the fear of not only growing up but becoming overwhelmed by the worldly sorrows of the grown-ups.Full of the small, beautiful moments of family life: the bath, the bicycle ride (the dad resting in the grass while the girls eat), the possibility of the mother's death frames a deeply moving story of two children at a loss as to how to cope with the illness and absence of their mother. And they've also just moved house, as Sen had before going through the tunnel, which in this film leads further into the forest, to the magnificent Caphor tree.A great deal is made of that which exists but cannot be seen by the adults. The Susuwatari, the rustle of wind that in fact is something much more than mere wind, the rain that hides more on the darkening nightly road than an ordinary bus, the planted seeds that magically grow overnight; all this leads to the final emotional resolve, where the girls deliver an ear of corn on the windowsill of their mother's hospital room. In a sense, the whole film is all about this trip the children make, where the film tries to convince us that in that ear of corn not everything is as it seems.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the third Miyazaki film I've seen and it's the first family anime to make me feel like a child again. I didn't see it as a kid, I just recently watched it and yet it still took me away into a world of great imagination and adventure. Most family films don't do that to me as an adult (mostly films I never grew up with such as this.) The dubbing isn't all that bad but it's not spectacular ether. What's important is how well the premise and the characters and the moral (I don't think this even has a moral but it doesn't need one, in my opinion. It can be just a whimsical imaginative fantasy like Alice in Wonderland) is written and it's all written very well. I still find it hard to believe how well the animation is, considering the fact that it's a late 80's film. Topnotch animation. Give it a world.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Magically capturing the beauty &amp; innocence of childhood, My Neighbor Totoro is a magnificent example of hand-drawn animation from Studio Ghibli. Set in a rural village in post-war Japan, it tells the story of two little girls who move to a new place with their father so that they can be near to the hospital where their mother is recovering from a long-term illness and covers the little girls' adventures with the wood spirits living in a nearby forest.Directed by world's renowned artist Hayao Miyazaki, My Neighbor Totoro isn't any conflicted or tragic story but is simply a reflection &amp; celebration of life &amp; its little adventures. The childhood of the two girls portrayed here is extremely convincing, the fanciful creatures including Totoro are freshly imagined, the 2D animation mirrors a beautiful painting, the voice actors are lively in their roles &amp; the music is as heartwarming as it is soothing.On an overall scale, My Neighbor Totoro is a nostalgic journey of childhood, an adventure for all ages &amp; a subtle commentary about the depleting relationship between humans &amp; nature. It brings on screen some wondrous creatures of fantasy &amp; yet remains grounded throughout its runtime. A simple, heartfelt &amp; joyous cinema that takes us through little bits of every emotion, My Neighbor Totoro is a cinematic gem that viewers are going to cherish for a long, long time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Like most of Hayao Miyazaki's movies, "My Neighbour Totoro" belongs to the creme de la creme of animated movies (and movies in general), an absolute must-see that, while being mostly lighthearted and happy, doesn't come across as bland at all and will definitively leave you with a joy-filled heart during and long after the movie. You can watch it on your own or with your whole family! The fluid, top-class animation, the beautiful landscapes, the great music and the likable characters all add up to an iconic movie that won't be forgotten soon. At this point, I also want to recommend Miyazaki's other works, which are often more serious than "My Neighbour Totoro", but absolutely on a par with it: you can really feel how he and Studio Ghibli put a lot of love and dedication into their work.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of Ghibli's greatest masterpieces ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Tonari no Totoro", also called "My Neighbor Totoro" in English, is a family-oriented anime feature made in 1988 by Hayao Miyazaki and his own-founded company Studio Ghibli.Basic plot: When Satsuki and her little sister Mei move into a country house together with their father (so they get to be closer to their sick mother who's in a hospital), they get to be friends with various creatures and a forest keeper called Totoro. So the sisters get to experience a great adventure together.For several years ago, I first saw this on a Norwegian DVD I rented at the library where I'm working. And this made me want to watch more movies made by director Hayao Miyazaki and Studio Ghibli, including "Howl's Moving Castle", "Spirited Away" and "Ponyo".When I first saw this flick, I found the animation and the drawings to be wonderful, and the story to be pretty good for an animated feature made for the general audience. To be more right, I just enjoy the animation style Studio Ghibli is giving us the audience. This studio just seems to know how to put elements like humor, suspense and dramatic into their works, and how to make a good family-friendly story as "Totoro" has.For the content itself, the most comical scene all together has to be the rainy scene where Satsuki offers Totoro her umbrella, and Totoro seems to get delighted by the raindrops falling on the umbrella.It is also interesting to see that the film's titular character Totoro is also used as the mascot for the company itself, hence this character being a part of the Studio Ghibli logo.The Malay box set called "Studio Ghibli Movies Collection", which I have as bought through eBay, includes 17 nicely done animated movies and a concert special, with "My Neighbor Totoro" as one of them.At the end, I recommend this for any family around the world. Because of this being one of the greatest Ghibli masterpieces I've seen, I give this a full rating of 10/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A gorgeous, pitch-perfect example of Studio Ghibli's wonderful trademarked style. Bubbling over with awe, wonder, curiosity and optimism, it's downright impossible not to get sucked into viewing and enjoying this through the eyes of its two young protagonists, recognizing forgotten flashes of our own youth at several steps along the way. The plot isn't particularly deep or elaborate, but in many ways I can see that as a positive - why force drama into a scenario that's working perfectly well as a quiet, leisurely stroll down imagination lane? I was actually relieved when it became clear they weren't even thinking of moving in that direction. Even the more reflective moments don't miss a beat, as Miyazaki and company lovingly flush the screen with life in dozens of cheery, unexpected ways. Magnificent animation pairs with a breathtaking setting, a playful spirit, a lovable cast of characters, great timing and a moderate dash of real-life tangibility. Authentic and vivid and pleasant, with at least one foot planted firmly in our world... despite the constant presence of an eight-foot Furby.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A magical story given the Studio Ghibli treatment to great effect? Excellent!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Another one in my mini Studio Ghibli series. I remember the first time I saw this how blown away I was by the way everything looked so natural. The way people move, the animals and the plants all drawn with such care and attention to detail. Add to that a magical story and you've got what Disney is constantly on the lookout for. Unfortunately (for them) it's a story that I don't think would translate well for the markets they're catering for. But I digress, here is a very brief summary before I give you my thoughts on the matter.Satsuki and Mei have moved house with their father so they can be near their mother who is in hospital. Their new house is in the countryside next to a forest. The girls have great fun exploring and when Satsuki has to go to school Mai goes off on her own. She discovers some magical forest creatures, Totoro's, one of which is of massive proportions! Soon Satsuki sees him too and they have many adventures together. But when Mei gets lost and Satsuki has exhausted every other avenue of help, it's to Totoro that she turns? Can he help her find her little sister? Well, I guess I had better not tell you that or the Spoiler Police (Ghibli Division) will be revoking my viewing rights (again).Beautifully animated with great attention to detail, I really love the way this film looks. I watched it in Japanese with subtitles and I didn't mind one bit, it's a really easy plot to follow and so not too taxing on the little grey cells. I will give honourable mentions to the voice talents of; Noriko Hidaka as Satsuki, Chika Sakamoto as Mei, Shigesato Itoi as Tatsuo Kusakabe (the father) and Sumi Shimamoto as Yasuko Kusakabe (the mother).A simple story is the backbone of this film; the magical world of Totoro really makes it a terrific watch. On the downside, I did find the girls voices tended to get a little grating towards the end? most of their dialogue seems to be SHOUTED! Apart from that, I found it beautiful to look at with a quite magical tale, not a lot to dislike here? Recommended.My score: 8.6/10.IMDb Score: 8.2/10 (based on 47,047 votes at the time of going to press).Rotten Tomatoes 'Tomatometer' Score: 90/100 (based on 29 reviews counted at the time of going to press).

It takes place in Tokorozawa city in Saitama in Japan. I liked the film because Totoro is so cute! Furthermore, it reminds me of feelings when I was a child. At the end of the film, although their mother had been in hospital and had a serious illness, she was very well. As a result, Satsuki, Mei and their father prepared to welcome their mother home. This film is one of the most famous films in Japan.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A wonderful Japanese anime about two little girls and their coping with the sickness of their mother. Through letting loose their imagination and crawling through the rabbit hole, they discover a magnificent world. But unlike Alice in Wonderland, there's no evil in their world. Only totoros, spirit-like creatures only visible in the eyes of lucky children. The parents of the girls listen to their kids and don't accuse them of lying. They actually do the contrary and encourage them to have a vivid imagination. This is probably the best message for young children. Hayao Miyazaki and Studio Ghibli present a classic but colorful world with great details. It's a treat for the beholders. Despite the fact the movie is made in 1988, it's still a joy to see. It's a great family film and highly recommended for all ages.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>We all know Hayao Miyazaki is an anime genius, creating stories focusing on character, story and fantasy, letting his imagine run wild. He has created great films like Spirited Away, Howl's Moving Castle and Princess Mononoke. My Neighbour Totoro is considered one of his first great works.Mr. Kusakabe (Shigesato Itoi) and his two daughters Satsuki (Noriko Hidaka) and Mei (Chika Sakamoto) move to a new home in rural Japan so they could be close to their sick mother (Sumi Shimamoto). They new home is run down and filled with soot spirits, but the family soon settle in. One day Mei meets a strange giant creature called Totoro, a large furry animal who has two minions. No one believes Mei at first but after Mei disappears Satsuki has to call Totoro for help.My Neighbour Totoro is a strange little film, but Miyazaki does have an understanding of a child's imagine (either that or he takes a lot powerful narcotics). There is a certain Alice in Wonderland feel about the film, with Mei going down a hole and Totoro and the Catbus (one of the weirdest ideas ever) looking like the Chester Cat. But the main focus of the film is the relationship between the young girls and the their father who is obviously overwhelmed with his caring for the girls, having a wife in hospital and continuing with his job. The children are energetic and believable and the film is about the wonders of a child's imagination. Only the children can see the creatures and it is almost dream like. But the girls are also dealing with a proper issues, particularly Satsuki who has to act as Mei's guardian and tries to be strong because Mei does not truly understand what's happening to their mum. What surprised me was that My Neighbour Totoro was very grounded, focusing on the girls: I would have liked to have seen more interaction with the creatures, especially because Miyazaki is so great at creating worlds and a great fantasy storytelling.The animation is great, as is expected from a Miyazaki film and there are some very surreal moments. The film is fast paced as hoped for in a children's animated film. But the film is so fast that some things are not explained, like a young boy, Kanta (Toshiyuki Amagasa)'s animosity towards Satsuki. He said that its because that there house is haunted, but surely there was more, maybe he was hurt by Totoro or the house or maybe it is something more basic, like he finds girls inky or fancies Satsuki and he does not know what to do about it.My Neighbour Totoro does have a very sweet nature about it, about how characters interact and the way Totoro and his friends reaction to humans, the small creatures being like normal animals with mystical powers. Totoro is a curious creature who is interested by the children's kindness and the gift of a umbrella, leading to the simple wonders of a big water drops hitting the umbrella. There is also the great Miyazaki trait of silence, letting scenes and actions play out without much sound or dialogue. It plays a universal audience. It was a charming atmosphere.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Unlike a lot of other's reviewing this, i didn't grow up watching this. I watched this movie for the first time in 2010, and i was 19. I'm capable of temporarily adjusting the age of my mind, to enjoy the more simple films, and view them as they were meant to be seen, and understood. That being said, i won't be judging this film and nitpicking the smallest of problems in the view because those problems are irrelevant considering this is a cartoon written, and made for children.Although this movie is aimed at children, it is unique, and different enough compared to other children's movies that it almost gives off this "Wizard of Oz" feeling, where you can enjoy this as a true piece of art, rather than another lame children's movie thrown together over night.The depth in these girls are outstanding for such a simple film, and it feels as if you really know them by the end. And Totoro is just adorable. The person behind the idea of this character is very creative and original.You can poke holes in this story, and point out a few things that don't add up, but in the end it has a lot of things that don't work in our "real" world, so you shouldn't expect the movie to make complete absolute sense.The bottom line is, if you can watch a touching, and heartwarming children's movie without thinking "This is totally gay!", and you're mature enough to connect with these characters than it's a movie you can watch and enjoy over and over again.So if you haven't seen this, check it out. It is definitely worth your time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>There is some magic in this title</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My 4 year old absolutely loves it and learned the song by herself in Japanese. I do like most Miyasaki films this however is special I don't know if its the giant fluffy Totoro the bizarre Cheshire like cat bus which I bought when I visited Japan. The fact that they portray a believable family view through the eyes of little Mei. The story is quite simple not clichéd it falls into a visual narrative with great views with an amazing level of detail counting this film is 20 years it remains ageless and is greatly enjoyable. Miyasaki is not the Disney of Japan he is in a league of his own. A must see for the family particularly if you dislike the princess stereotypes. The music is quite catchy too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A portray of the magic of childhood</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Another beauty from Ghibli Studios and Hayao Miyazaki.My neighbor Totoro tells the story of two young children -Satsuki and Mei- who move to the countryside with their father to a new house to prepare the arrival of their mother from hospital.The script is simpler than Miyazaki's other movies, but it is tremendously enjoyable and captivating despite its flaws. In fact, this is, perhaps, Miyazaki's sweetest movie ever, as it is captures the essence of being a child, with the innocence, naughtiness and magic that surround it. We see the simple things that make children happy: playing with little things, imagining things, the thrill of moving to a new place and making new friends, siblings' relationships of dependence, love and hatred, and the magic that innocence can create. Anybody can remember special moments of his/her childhood when watching this movie.Much of the appeal of the film are the characters of the two little girls and their neighbor old "grandma nanny" to whom the viewer feels immediately drawn, but also to the quirky plush-ish characters of Totoro and friends. The dubbing of the actors in the Japanese version is excellent and really honors the characters and makes them even more adorable.Not less important in the movie, is the fantastic drawing of the Japanese scenery, so beautiful and emotionally connected to the story. The landscape, and Nature, play an important part in the movie, and, as in other Miyaki's films, the themes of the magic in Nature and the power of being in harmony with the environment are also explored here.A delightful movie for children and animation lovers in general.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>excerpt, full review at my location.Disallowed from becoming a candidate for the Cannes Film Festival, due to it being screened outside of France, and deemed "too American" to receive French subsidies by a Paris court, the release of Jean-Pierre Jeunet's A Very Long Engagement was not without its fair share of controversy.A Very Long Engagement's depiction of the indelible marks that war leaves upon everyone it touches, and its story of one woman's quest to find the man she loves, is thoroughly engaging. It doesn't always feel as memorable and original as some of Jeunet's previous films but it does boast all of the classic quirks associated with a Jeunet film, including memorable performances from its wonderful cast and some truly beautiful imagery.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am a huge Studio Ghibli/Miyazaki fan, and My Neighbour Totoro is no exception. In fact it is one of my favourites from them. There are so many wonderful things about My Neighbour Totoro. It is very simple in story and character but it is all very beautiful, charming and touching. The animation is typical Ghibli, ethereal-looking and just ravishing to watch, while the music is one of my favourite scores in a Ghibli film. The story is simple, but I loved the simplicity, it had such a pleasant atmosphere to it, and the characters are engaging with great chemistry together. I have very little to complain about the voice acting either, everybody did a fine job. In conclusion, in my opinion this is an animated classic. 10/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Satsuke (Dakota Fanning) and her little sister Mei (Elle Fanning) are moving into a new house with their father, so that they can live closer to their mother, who is in the hospital. Mei soon discovers that creatures called Totoros are living in the nearby forest, and Mei and her sister become friends with the Totoros.The family's struggles in My Neighbor Totoro were extremely realistic, and even though for the most part it was not a very serious film, I think the problems that the family faces could really appeal to more than just children. The English voices for this film I thought were very good, but I definitely prefer it to be in Japanese, so if you are faced with that choice, I would suggest Japanese with English subtitles. Now, Spirited Away is the only other Miyazaki film I have ever seen, so My Neighbor Totoro was not quite as good as Spirited Away, but by all means still a great film. The story, like Spirited Away, was very creative, and I am quickly becoming a huge fan of the Japanese animation master, Hayao Miyazaki.I was surprised to find that there was no villain in the story. Unlike Spirited Away where the hero of our story is against certain characters in the film, My Neighbor Totoro is basically just about the life of the children, and often has things about both the parents in the movie. The animation was beautiful. It was absolutely stunning. Which is one of my favorite things about Miyazaki's films, or at least the ones I have seen. The animation is so incredible, even if someone was to not like the story, I don't see how anyone could complain about the visuals.Overall, Hayao Miyazaki yet again shows us a wonderful world of imagination, and storytelling, in his film My Neighbor Totoro. While it has its flaws, it is still worthy of multiple viewings.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A treat for all to cherish</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1988, after the delightful Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind (1984) and Laputa: Castle in the Sky (1986), Hayao Miyazaki turned his attention to an even younger audience for this sugar-sweet fairy tale charting the adventures of the two young girls, Satsuki (Noriko Hidaka) and Mei (Chika Sakamoto), who move to the countryside with their university professor father (Shigesato Itoi) to be near the hospital where their mother (Sumi Shimamoto) recovers from a nameless illness.It is narrower of scope than the aforementioned classics - deliberately so, because this is a essentially a small-scale drama about a family coping with a terminal illness. That sounds dreadfully morose for what is a work aimed at very young children, but it's all played out very cheerfully, as we gradually enter the kids' fantastical world. In this world they meet the sleepy troll called Totoro. Their passion gives him a reason to awaken, and he becomes the totem of strength and vitality the girls need to cope with the uncertainty surrounding their mother's condition.We often speak of Pixar's and Dreamworks' canniness with the subtle grown-up substance of their animations. But Miyazaki goes beyond winks and trivial references. Perhaps it is the simplicity of his refreshingly formless narrative, but his symbolism has never been stronger than here. At one point, Mei becomes disillusioned by the fact that her acorns will not grow. Then, one night, she and Satsuki meet Totoro and perform a strange rain dance. The acorns don't just grow - an oak tree explodes from the earth, growing a hundred feet high in seconds. It's just one of many beautiful, hopeful scenes, all of which are delivered with a delirious smile.There is more than one nod to Lewis Carroll's Alice In Wonderland: Mei enter's Totoro's realm through a mazy, rabbit hole-style tunnel, while the hilarious 'Catbus' bears the perennial grin of the Cheshire Cat. But parents should not worry about any lurid drug references - this is a film that relishes the trappings of innocence better than any other I've seen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A highly charming, imaginative and heartwarming animated film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"My Neighbor Totoro"Animated, 1988, JapanRunning time: 88 minutes Written and directed by: Hiyao Miyazaki* * * 1/2 Very GoodI happened to see this film March 13, 2010, for the very first time and have many positive adjectives of praise for this film fresh in mind. My first impressions are: "My Neighbor Totoro" is an exceptionally imaginative, detailed, charming, heartwarming and very cute film. Japan has mastered cute probably better than anyone else in the world. Cute is relatively easy to achieve, especially in an animated film, as the legacy of Disney shows. So, cute, really is a weak adjective of praise here."My Neighbor Totoro", 1988, is the first feature length animated film from the acclaimed animation director Hayao Miyazaki of Japan. Prior to this film, he worked in television, but found that artistically unsatisfying over time. Miyazaki has said, at first, he did not consider animation, as the medium of choice, for his imaginative stories and career change. For anyone with a large and vivid imagination, animation is the ideal choice of expression. If one can imagine it, one can bring it to life in animation, without difficulty or great expense, as compared to live action film.What most impressed me about this film is Miyazaki's keen knowledge and expression of how it feels to be a child, how we perceive and react to the world around us, with energy, excitement, enthusiasm, imagination and curiosity. To me, this is what came across, most profoundly. Animation and sound are good overall in the film, nothing especially impressive. This is to be expected, as a first time feature length film director rarely is granted a large budget for their very first film. What's impressive about "My Neighbor Totoro", is the storytelling. That's what matters most, of course. Film is simply a highly visual medium of storytelling.Miyazaki based the story of the film on his own childhood, growing up in rural Japan during the 1950's. All of the locations in the animated film, have their real life counterparts in Japan. The story concerns two young girls and their father, who move into a new countryside home, while their mother is away, sick in a hospital. Totoro can best be described as a large, gentle, friendly, furry, teddy bear-cat kind of creature, who is actually a spirit of the forest, near the new home of the two girls. Miyazaki is wise to hold off and wait until the halfway point of the story, to introduce the main character of Totoro, to build up the anticipation of Totoro's arrival in the film. The cat bus is an especially charming and imaginative character that appears later in the film. Miyazki's story telling style keeps some suspense going, regarding the mother's relation to the story.Miyzaki's film takes it's time to slowly introduce it's characters and become acquainted with them. Clearly, Miyazaki is a gifted storyteller, with heart and details in his characters and stories. What people appreciate most about his animated films is that they are about ordinary, common people in extraordinary situations and told with heart, charm, genuine emotion and special little details, regarding the characters, landscapes and inventions. When first released theatrically in Japan, "My Neighbor Totoro" was only modestly successful. When it was later released on television in Japan, it took off in popularity.I have seen a number of Miyazaki films since his "Princess Mononoke", 1997, before seeing "My Neighbor Totoro", his very first film. "My Neighbor Totoro" by itself, is enough to have made me a Miyazaki fan, if I had seen it years ago, before I ever saw any of his other animated films.Miyazaki's animated films are the type that always present something new both in characters and inventions, in an engaging and captivating way. With most of his animated films, it always worth experiencing them again and they continue to delight and entertain, both children and adults alike.I consider myself a child at heart. I remember how it felt to be a child. How the world seemed so different at that time in life.. Children perceive and react to the world much differently than adults. Viewing a film such as "My Neighbor Totoro", Miyazaki recaptures childhood very accurately. Doesn't really matter he is Japanese. Children are children, with the same traits, all over the world, regardless of country or culture.To me, Miyazaki deserves comparison to the great animation pioneer, Walt Disney. I realize this is a big compliment, however I feel that Miyazaki has earned and deserves comparison to Disney. Like Disney, Miyazaki is also highly imaginative, artistic and detailed with his animation stories, as was Walt Disney. I consider Miyazaki, the new Disney. Miyazaki is an excellent story teller and deserves his exalted and admired status within the animation industry, here in the United States.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My Neighbor Totoro is one of those truly wonderful films that transcend the words "heartwarming" and "joyful." This is a movie that any human from 5 to 95 can enjoy. There is something truly powerful and transcendent about happiness and innocence; and Totoro is a reminder that there is something happy and joyful inside all of us that is truly our strength, and the basis for life itself. Totoro is a superior movie that stands on its own, without reference to pop-culture tawdriness, melodrama, or mindless violence. Totoro is a great barometer for friends and relationships. If you have doubts about the sanity of anybody you know, play this movie for them. Haters, anti-social types, and people with indelible character flaws won't like this movie, and you can dump them!And oh by the way, the animation is awesome.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There really are no "bad" Miyazaki movies. And Totoro was the 2nd one of his movies I'd seen, and after seeing most if not all of his movies, this one remains my favorite. It captures childhood innocence and countryside playing immaculately while introducing one of the most recognizable and iconic cartoon characters ever to come from Japan. Totoro is pure enjoyment and fun. From the music to the animation and the beloved Totoro and Neko-Bus, this movie shines and charms. There are so many wonderful scenes and most people will rightfully point to the bus-stop scene as the centerpiece scene - it's my favorite in the movie too no doubt; to add to that I liked the simple countryside story, the settings, background, the noises and sounds and the life depicted. The Japanese voice actors do a fine job as usual too. Totoro is a true classic of animation - as good or better as any Disney or other animation ever crafted, and most likely will remain my particular favorite. Simple, playful, and warm, Totoro will charm like few movies can. Tops - Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hayao Miyazaki is one of my favorite directors, and not one of his films had disappointed me. Totoro is no exception, and is wonderful to watch when you don't feel like watching a movie with car chases, or transforming robots or bond villains or whatever. It's just a really relaxing film to watch and can really calm you down. Despite lacking in plot, it gains its story from everyday situations, and leaves you feeling satisfied at the end. A great thing for me was how much it reminded me of my own childhood, how you would wander off and get lost, exploring and the excitement of moving into a new house. I totally recommend this for anyone. People call it a children's movie, but to be honest, anyone can watch and fall in love with it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Maybe its nostalgia, because it was my first. Before I knew anything about anime or Miyazaki, I saw this on a rack at a supermarket in the early '90s and begged my mom to get it for me on VHS. And I'm so glad that she did, because this is one of the greatest films of all time. I liked it then, but I do remember thinking it was a bit slow and silly. But watching it now, its a wondrous tale of childhood and growing up. It's also the most different of Miyazaki's tales, I think, which gives it its own sort of value. Even though I feel this movie is perhaps spiritually closest to Spirited Away, a movie I never really liked all that much, it captures so well the awe of exploring as a child and the heartache of life's troubles seen through the lens of a child. This isn't so much a movie for children, but a movie about children for adults, a movie that allows them to travel back in time to when they were children. No movie so perfectly captures the magic of youth at My Neighbor Totoro.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Today I saw this fun filled masterpiece by Miyazaki.... the first half of the film breezes through and is thoroughly entertaining. The characters of Satsuki &amp; Mei are brilliant to say the least, especially Mei's, who's a treat to watch. The movie says the story of two little sisters who shift to a new place with their father and the whimsical adventures that happen in that short stay of theirs.It tells us that the uncertainties of life offer us all the interesting escapades it needs. I had apprehensions before seeing the dubbed version. But the English dub blew me away. I have yet to come across a better dub than this. The voice overs and accents were brilliant. The movie is simple, entertaining and you cant help but smile throughout while watching this bizarre yet enchanting drama unfold before your very eyes. The main character of this movie was Totoro who's very cute and kind and stays in a big tree. I would have loved to see more of him though. In the little span of 80 minutes we go across so many emotions and yet when the movie is done you can recollect each and everyone of them. If this movie doesn't warm you nothing ever will. This movie demands a repeated viewing, and I will give it one in days to come. Till then I will wait for my Totoro.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Truly Heartfelt Adventure!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hayao Miyazaki's films always seem to amaze me. Whether it be the dense and extremely poignant Princess Mononoke, or the beautiful and deeply affecting Spirited Away, he always manages to capture the viewer's imagination, but no other film in his catalog manages to ensnare the viewer quite like My Neighbor Totoro. In a way it is very different than many of his other films.My Neighbor Totoro is a simple film, but told in a very affecting way. It's the story of two young girls who move to the country with their father so that they can be near their ailing mother in the hospital. While at their new home the girls discover an ancient forest spirit called Totoro that can only be seen by children, and Totoro helps them to find hope within all their inner turmoil.It is safe to say that My Neighbor Totoro is quite possibly Miyazaki's most human film he has ever made. While there are many other Miyazaki films that are perhaps more breathtaking in scope and may have far more intriguing plots, My Neighbor Totoro puts all of its focus on the characters rather than the fantasy. As a matter of fact the fantasy within the film is very sparse, and appears at all the right moments to strike the perfect chord with your emotions. Though this should not lead one to believe the film doesn't have some awe-inspiring fantasy. It wouldn't be a Miyazaki film if it didn't. There are many sequences, such as the catbus scenes or the flight with Totoro that are simply magical and help solidify this film amongst the pantheon of other Studio Ghibli productions.Miyazaki makes the smart choice of telling the story through the eyes of the children rather than giving it a cynical adult spin. In doing this he draws us into this world; you literally feel as if you stepped in a time machine and went back into your childhood. The children treat the world as if it's this magical place, full of mystery and wonder. We never see the dark side of human nature within this film, cause as children we never did. What Miyazaki does show is how to enjoy life and its simplicities, but not only that he makes us remember that it's alright to feel emotion; to be scared, to laugh, to cry. As adults we very often forget these simple things, bottling everything up, making us bitter and cynical beings.Of course My Neighbor Totoro is just as gorgeous as any other Studio Ghibli production. My Neighbor Totoro features some of the finest hand-drawn animation I've ever seen. It's amazing that this was done back in the days before computers. Many of the shots are so complex to draw that most animators would shy away from doing without a computer, but not Miyazaki. Now while some fans may despise the dubbed versions of Miyazaki's films done by Disney, I've never minded them, and this is easily one of their better dubs thus far. Dakota and Elle Fanning are perfect as the two sisters. Their authentic chemistry really comes through on screen.Overall My Neighbor Totoro is a funny, heartwarming film. Miyazaki perfectly struck a chord with the audience on this one. It's an innocent look back at childhood, bringing back the sheer wonder that following a mysterious animal in the backyard could have. Though what this film truly does is make us as adults forget what we are truly missing, but as Totoro does with the girls, Miyazaki shows that there is hope in us rediscovering that innocence and simplicity once more.I give My Neighbor Totoro a beautiful 10 out of 10!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Totoro can be my Neighbor!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are very few directors/writers that can bring a "G" rated family film that is not only entertaining to children, but a wonder for adults. Before bringing us treasures like "Princess Mononoke" and "Spirited Away", My Neighbor Totoro showcased where Hayao Miyazaki would be for the next 20 years: on top of the animation game.A father moves in to an old home with his two daughters, Satsuki, the older sister, and Mei, who looks to be about 5. Mother is sick, &amp; away at the hospital, and they have an opportunity to see her sometimes. They meet new friends, including a boy who tells them the place they moved into is haunted. The new place is wondrous, but perhaps a little creepy. What happens after this is up to you. It's either a big, colorful part of a child's imagination, a real magical adventure, or a hallucinogenic trip from a mushroom accidentally eaten in the big backyard they have. NO, scratch that last part.They soon encounter a "Totoro" a big, fluffy bear/cat/bird like creature who's as gentle as a sleepy puppy. Oh, he just happens to be the king of the forest. Other encounters include a cat bus, "dust bunnies" or "soot sprites" that are also found later in Miyazaki's Spirited Away, &amp; a tree that... well I don't want to give it away.It's simplicity is deceiving. The movie moves slow and makes you think that nothing much else is going to happen, yet by it's end we have seen everything from forming friendships, the importance of family, commune with nature &amp; the human spirit in it's way of overcoming life's problems.About the only problem I had with the movie is that it was way too short! Not short by the standard family animation, but short for a Miyazaki movie, who's films usually clock in at 2 hours! Regardless, this is a must see. My daughters love it, and stand absolutely mesmerized in delight. So do I. Even the credits are a treat!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Tonari no Totoro" is yet another masterpiece from one of the most fantastic minds in the world. Where does Hayao Miyazaki take all his magical tales from? The feature from 1988 tells us the story about Satsuki and Mei, two little girls brought up in rural Japan by their father. The movie starts when the little family are on their way to their new house, which they have moved to so they can be closer to the hospital where their ill mother is staying.One day while playing outside, four year old Mei wanders off in to the forest, following two strange little creatures. They lead her into a hollow in a enormous tree where she falls down and lands on the belly of an enormous version of the little ones. The creature gasps loudly, and Mei interprets the sound as To-to-ro, before she falls to sleep on it.This is only the start of Miyazakis magical and wonderful tale, which includes raising giant trees from little seeds, flying through the countryside on Totoro and an amazing bus who looks just like a cat and jumps instead of rolling! A must-see for every child and adults in contact with their own child inside. Miyazaki-san, I bow my head in awe. A perfect 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In 1988, Studio Ghibli took quite a financial risk in making two films at the same time. One was "Grave of the Fireflies", Isao Takahata's undeniable masterpiece. The other one is this, Hayao Miyazaki's final break through as an internationally known director, "My Neighbour Totoro" (Tonari no Totoro, 1988). Although the difference between the two films is like a day and night, they have both earned their places amongst great animations. If "Grave of the Fireflies" made you cry, "Totoro" will quickly put a smile back to your face.The story centers around two sisters, Satsuki and Mei, who move to country with their father, while their mother is recovering in a hospital from an unspecified illness. While the girls try to cope with their mother's situation and their new environment, they also meet a strange spirit named Totoro who lives in the nearby forest.There really is nothing more to tell about the plot without giving away too much. "Totoro" is a very simple film and works that way. It's absolutely positive film, one that makes you smile, no matter if you're a child of not. This may be the most "suitable for children film" Miyazaki has made, but it is certainly suitable for more mature viewers also. I am nearly 20 year old guy and I think this is a fantastic film. It's such a perfect family movie in many ways. For one there are the fantasy elements with Totoro (who looks so utterly incredible that it's no wonder it made to Ghibli's logo) and the various incredible things the girls experience with it. But there are also suitable amount of realism (with the mother and her illness) that the film stays nicely close to earth.I really have difficult time explaining what makes this film so unique. Like most Ghibli films you just have to experience them. The various scenes in this film are at the same time so simple and yet so imaginative you wouldn't believe it (my favorite is the scene where Satsuki and Totoro both wait a buss in the rain). "Totoro" simply has that magic of animation that makes you love it. Technically the film is yet another sample of Miyazaki's talents, and with this film I believe he finally reached his own style that has followed to his later films. Joe Hisaishi once again creates the most magical music that a film like this deserves. I haven't heard either of the two English dubs so I can't tell about them, but Japanese audio is once again done with professional talent. The older sister Satsuki is voiced by Noriko Hidaka, whom anime fans know as Akane in "Ranma 1/2", Jean in "Nadia: the Secret of Blue Water", Kikyo in "Inuyasha" and Near in "Death Note". In a minor role as the mother of the girls, is Sumi Shimamoto, who voiced the title character in early Ghibli movie "Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind".I really would want to recommend this film more and tell about how fantastic and adorable it is, but I simply can't find words for it. I happily recommend this film, no matter if you watch it alone or with a whole family. It made me smile like a ten year old, and that doesn't happen very often. This film lasts through many views.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>&#x3068;&#x306a;&#x308a;&#x306e;&#x30c8;&#x30c8;&#x30ed;: A wonderful gem about/for the family</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As for many others, I guess, Spirited Away was my introduction to the work of Hayao Miyazaki and as many others, I loved that picture when I saw it on theaters back in the year 2003. Now thanks to my cousin I have seen My Neighbor Totoro on DVD and I can say that is just another gem of Miyazaki.Is a simple but wonderful story about family and the rural Japan is the place for this story. You will be always kind of worry about the two main characters of the story: Satsuki and Mei, two sisters of 10 and 5 years old respectively. Their mother must be at the hospital so they must stay only with their father Tatsuo who works at the University. All of this makes that the girls stay a lot of time alone in a place where getting lost seems very easy but they take care of each other as good sisters. Of course Miyazaki immense imagination is here, of course to help this little girls and when Totoro appears is just fun. I really love this amazing character; sort of a big rabbit that seems always to be very lazy but the magic is here and with the Catbus (another product of Miyazaki's trip) they become soon the adoration and the helpers of the sisters. Is a family movie so is always present the feel of being worried about a family member (the absence of the mother of course but there are many scenes where you can find that feel, for example when it's raining in the bus stop in what probably is my favourite scene) but also that feel of being helped by the people near to you (in this case the people of the village were very kind and really helpful), never loosing the hopes.Conclusion: If you ask me about the animation, I have few words to say: is a piece of work. And if you ask me about the dubbing, well I watched the version of Spain and it's pretty good but I do have desires to watch the film with the original language. Anyway, My Neighbor Totoro is a wonderful gem for the whole family (I actually saw this with two of my cousins and with my grandma and the four of us loved the film) and personally after watching my second Miyazaki film I do have a lot of desires to check his entire work. Keep on smoking Hayao!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I loved this film -- both delightful and edifying</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I loved this film. I had to buy a DVD copy, even though I don't have a DVD player, and have to view it on my computer. The visual effects are charming and delightful. The images of a culture, a society and a lifestyle deserve carefully study, repeated viewing and, in my opinion, emulation.I was fascinated by the details of the architecture of the country house to which the girls moved. They illustrate the unique and charming features of traditional Japanese domestic architecture. The, to me, novel character of the mythical folklore characters found in the film was an eyeopening experience. Finally, I was totally seduced by the depiction of a happy, peaceful and fully functional society into which the household was seamlessly integrated. We should all live in such a happy world!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hard to explain how good this is</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've seen quite a few anime, but this is the first one that I really loved. Hard to explain, not much of a plot because it's the subtleties in this film that make it so great, and if you told anyone about them, it kinda sounds lame. And even though it's very very very cute, it also deals with heavier issues e.g. the mother issue, but it's believable, even though it has a strong fantasy element And while Monsters Inc is good because it makes monsters less scary for kids, I think this film is better, because the monsters in this film are not scary, and wonderful, but that sound that the big Totoro makes was a classic monster sound. It scared the crap out of my dogs. :-)Better than Spirited Away in my opinion.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is my third Miyazaki film, and I've yet to be disappointed. The only thing I regret about this film, as well as Spirited Away is that I didn't have an opportunity to see them as a child. In this beautifully crafted film, two little girls and their father move to the country to be closer to their ailing mother who is in the hospital. In their new home they find forest spirits who become their friends.It is almost inevitable that I compare Miyazaki with Walt Disney. He is often called Japan's Disney. Although, I grew up with Disney, it's obvious for me that Miyaki's crafting is far more complex and less condescending than Disney. For the most part clichés are avoided (like Adults don't believe the children's fantasy world), and the children seem so much truer to the real world. They are sometimes annoying, loud and they're always laughing. These films seem to be so much more linked to culture, and it's interesting the differences in culture between the East and the West, especially in regards to mythology and nature.This film is bittersweet and it appeals to both children and adults. It's enchanting, and unlike many children films there are villains and the typical adults vs. children storyline is thankfully not employed. However, this film is not without it's tension and even those moments of loss of hope and even fear, it just never uses extremes or hate to create them. Most of all though, the stunningly beautiful and detailed animation is stunning. It's original and imaginative, just the thing to capture your attention. The beautiful watercolour backgrounds seem so rich and unbearably beautiful, that that alone can be warrant for this excellent film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I LOVE Totoro!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I was around 3 years old, I watched Totoro for the very first time. Ever since then, I have been in love with the movie. There is something about Totoro that is just amazing. I believe that Totoro must be watched at a young age at first so that the person can watch the movie as they grow, and it becomes part of their life. It seems as if Miyazaki knows what goes on in the mind of a child, because when I watched it when i was little, it just had this certain indescribable spark. He truly is a genius. Every time I watch Totoro, I notice something different. The detail in the animation is unbelievable. It is truly an amazing film. I love Totoro!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>this is a children's' anime, but adults will like it too (i did). It has a simple plot of two adorable sisters and their fantastic little adventure in the house they just moved into.Actually the plot is fairly simple but always interesting, mainly due to the unerring accuracy of the portrayals of the characters; they're real and amusing because they will remind you of your own childhoods (if you were lucky enough to have one as nice as this). The movie feels original, and stays far away from the clichés of kids' films.From the start I was charmed by the beautiful animation and the joy and cuteness of the girls and the affection between them.The movie has some drama, centering on the health of their mother, who is recovering from illness at a hospital, but it leaves you with a smile on your face and a tear in your eye. It never fails to put me in a good mood.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a boy of thirteen who is vastly becoming a huge fan of Studio Ghibli and it's films I was impressed with My Neighbour Totoro for these reasons.1. The story was a wonderful heartwarming tale that many people can relate to.2. As in all Ghibli films there is a particular attention to scenery such as the scene when the two girls are at the bus stop there is a simple shot of a frog on the ground surrounded by puddles and another is just of a basket of tomatoes. These shots are so simple yet so marvellously drawn .I think that whether you are a die hard fan or a child you will find this movie uplifting and extremely easy to watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Film For All Generations</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>TOTORO, in classic Miyazaki tradition, brings the fantastic into the realm of everyday occurrences. The underlying story is rather unextraordinary: a Japanese father moves into the countryside with his two daughters, and they adjust to their new pastoral environment while waiting for the mother to be released from the hospital. We are not explained exactly why the mother is bedridden, but the ambiguous reason for her hospitalization plays an effective role in keeping the dramatic tension taught throughout the film. However, the plot is driven mainly by the imagination of the two children whose experiences with the magical create the driving mechanism behind the film. Without giving anything away, TOTORO is a heartwarming film that inspires both the young and the old alike. Watching the film again several years after seeing it in the theaters, I realize that the story works not because it is about fantastic and magical characters but rather it involves everyday struggles to which we can relate. In TOTORO, we see Miyaki revisiting the same themes (involving familial harmony, nature, environmental awareness, courage, etc.) that he further develops in his later works. Nevertheless, the mastery and the imagination behind his craft keeps the story fresh. Despite what the Box Office report card may indicate for TOTORO, this is a film sure to be a hit with the family.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is infinitely lovely and beautiful. I just come across it and it becomes my favorite. I am not brought up by the tales of Totoro, but I am equally, if not more, touched as those who are.The Asian movies are different from those of the Hollywood, the Japanese ones especially subtle. This movie is not a strong story, rather it is a prose, a painting. The water-fields, the cedar trees, the summer rain, and the countryside people... extremely vivid and true.I believe kids will love Totoro, me too. But as a grown-up what I love most is the serenity, the innocence, and the purest happiness described in it.</fullReview>

I remember seeing many different ones, as a young person, and again, when my now 21 yr old daughter was small. I didn't realize how similar the figures are. Anyway, I then viewed the Disney version on TV with the Pixar guy telling us how he loved Hayao Miyazaki's work and how it influenced him and his career. That said, at the time, I liked the Disney presentation as I had none other to compare it to. Now, after viewing the 1st English translation and dubbing that was available before Disney's version, I can honestly say I like it the best. Miyazaki's artwork is impeccable...the story line is wonderful and makes me want to view all of his work. It will be a classic to add to my youngest children's collection.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent family movie - in several versions</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In case you do not already know, this is one of the great animated family movies of all time, another gem by the Japanese master Hayao Miyazaki and Studio Ghibli (maker of "Kiki's Delivery Service"). Any description of the story in mere words comes up short, especially since some of the most important parts of the story do not involve dialog per se. The story follows two young girls as they move into an old country house with their father while their mother is away in the hospital. There's no conflict driven plot, no good versus evil struggle, just a tale of discovery and wonder, and genuine emotion. Unlike most movies -- but like real life -- events seem to unfold naturally at their own pace. Rather than the audience being told what to think, and how to feel, Miyazaki lets us follow along while the two children discover and then befriend an amazing magical creature (Totoro) living in the enormous tree next door, a symbolic representation of both nature and the power of childhood imagination. Highly recommended for ages 6 through 60.Originally in Japanese, Totoro has been dubbed into English twice, the second time by media giant Disney using Hollywood talents such as Dakota Fanning and Tim Daly. Unfortunately, in my opinion, the Disney product is a bit "flatter." Disney also messed around with the dialog -- dumbing things down in an attempt to make things more easily understood. The result is that characters seem less intelligent and less is left to the imagination - which is exactly the opposite of Miyazaki's purpose in making movies all about imagination and a respect for children. The Disney version is available in DVD, but if you can find the older version on VHS videotape, I'd recommend it. It is not so much that the older version is perfect (it has its own drawbacks), but that the older version seems truer to the original spirit of Miyazaki.</fullReview>

When Satasuki goes to school Mei explores (as you do when you move into a new house). She sees a strange creature carrying a bag full of acorns, she continues to chase the creature until she comes into a great big tree. she falls on a big round, fat creature. which shes dubs totoro. thats all I'm giving away no, but the rest of the movie is an exceptional journey about life, innocence and realization. this was very good, sublime in fact but i don't have the same emotional connection with this as Miyazaki's Spirited Away. mayabe this has something we me owning the movie. enjoy ////</fullReview>

Totoro and other creatures are imaginative and colourful. I have seen spirited away and thought that was also a brilliant piece of work from studio Ghibili, this is more children orientated but thought I would buy it after seeing it was recommended.I have been a fan of Anime and Manga for over ten years, therefore I will be building up my collection . There is not much in the way of thrills and spills but as a family movie or something thats worth showing to friends who are into anime or not it is worth buying.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although I'm not a big fan of stories with no real conflict or character depth, Totoro was an admirable feature. I could have easily watched this film without sound and enjoyed it. The quality of the mise-en-scene was astounding. Nowhere besides in Japanese cinema do you get such images; The long shots, with little or no movement, a form of sentimentality in its most subtle form; The blending of colour so soft that the softest of sunsets cannot match this films tranquility; Combining images of normality and comfort with images of the fantastic, making us feel that even the typical is an extraordinary event. Cinema is not about story telling. The true cinematic masterpiece tells a story with images. The true cinema is a dynamic series of impressions. It is why two directors can use the same screenplay and make two completely different films. I would never view this film for its narrative merit, but would see it again simply for the power of its image. This movie is deserving of the title "Great Cinema"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is really cute. The characters are really endearing, and this is a very touching movie about family. In typical Miyazaki fashion, there is a world full of magic just waiting to be discovered. What is really nice is how the girls are encouraged to believe in the magic out there. The scene I loved was when they were all dancing around trying to make the acorns grow. I think more kids should believe in magic the way the characters in this movie do. The overall message of My Neighbor Totoro is simple, yet full of wonderful values. There is a real respect for nature, family, and kindness throughout the movie. This is a movie just about anybody can enjoy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>cute, but not just for kids</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After years of the Totoro plushies, I had a feeling this would be ultra-cutesy, Disnified, singsong fluff. It's not. It starts out with 2 little girls, aged about 9 &amp; 4, moving into their new house. The house is pretty run down, and it's my guess that the family moved there either to be closer to the hospital where the mother was, or to help pay for the mother's medical bills. After seeing some "dust bunnies", which later appear in Miazaki's "Spirited Away", the youngest girl goes exploring &amp; finds a tunnel into another, magical world. When she falls asleep on Totoro, who is like a big cat tolerating a child pulling its tail, she wakes up in the tunnel, and when she tries to find her way back, the tunnel just goes back outside again. About 20&amp; of the movie is like this, the girls discovering magic things that disappear. For being young, they have a lot to deal with. In one scene,, they wait all day &amp; night in the rain for their dad to come. Totoro appears, and adorableness ensues. At the end, in the credits, the animators hint that the mother comes home &amp; possibly has another baby. It's a good end to a good story, but one that might be missed if you leave early :P</fullReview>

		<fullReview>We saw this movie at our last Japanese lesson we had at school for this semester. I hadn't seen it before (the anime-freaks looked doubtfully at me) and as it is a Studio Ghibli piece, I had quite a good feeling about that this was going to be a good one (as the vast majority of Ghibli's works are so neat). I must say that the story was sweet, and there is some kind of magic woven in here, enhancing the movie in some way, putting a smile on your lips for sure. I can't really point out anything specific that I got really hooked on, but there were something with the atmosphere I believe. A solid 7/10 well worth seeing for the whole family.

		<shortDescription>Miyazaki's Best Family Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This has been a childhood favorite of mine for a long time. And the first Hayao Miyazaki film I've seen(way before I even knew who he was).This was released in Japan back in 1988 along with "Grave of the Fireflies" Came into the USA on VHS back in 1993(owned the Video for more than 10 years) and an upcoming DVD with a new English Debut coming in 2006! The story is taken place in the PostWar Era of Japan. With these 2 girls and their father moving to the Countryside. The girls like the house they've moved to(which is a 2 story home which is bigger than the other homes in the area). They're father is a College Professor. And their mother has a certain illness that had to be treated at this hospital that's in the country. Which is why they moved to the country so they can visit her more often.The 2 girls Satsuki and Mei, are enjoying their new home and the country life. Little do they know is that their neighbor is a big and powerful forest spirit who loves kids.Throughout the movie Totoro will help out Mei and Satsuki when they're in trouble. After you see the movie, you'd feel good about yourself.Unlike other Family Films this one is very special. It has wonderfully done backgrounds, characters, and music. The story is well written too. It's rated G has only one bath scene with the Dad bathing with his 2 girl(there's no mild nudity in that scene just know that in Japan it's completely normal to have a family bath). There aren't any villains or any one too cruel. It's a safe and perfect movie for the whole family to watch.I really recommend this to those who are Anime fans, Miyazaki fans, or even Animation fans.Get the DVD as soon as possible once it's in stores!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The respectively 4 and 8 year old Mei and Satsuki move with their father to the countryside of Saitama while the mother is in hospital. They find out that they live nearby a giant totoro.Its so great to see that this type of anime gets recognition in the west in the flood of violent ones. This is peaceful, humane and depicts real people instead of the Disney variety of sugarcoated tales. Hayao Miyazaki has made some terrific anime for kids that would not offend a grown up either. I discovered it just a few years ago and I thoroughly enjoy 'Future Boy Conan' and 'Sen to Chihiro no Kamikakushi' for instance.This is also nice, the imagination to come up with nekobus (cat-bus) and the totoro is childlike in a good way. It doesn't have a real story to tell however and that takes it a bit down.And to bathe with your children help give them a natural relationship with their bodies when they grow up and if thats offensive to you, stick with Disney.</fullReview>

It's great for kids to see other cultures in such a positive light.The soot spirits remind me of the characters in "Spirited Away".My only complaint is that Mei screams too much. Other than that, the cat bus is wonderful, the house is beautiful with the tatomi mats and screened walls. I love the tubs, too. I don't fully understand why this scene is considered "creepy" by other posters. My host families often had tubs similar to this and bathing as a family is not uncommon (not only in Japan).Anyway, we still enjoy this film (even after 234 viewings) and are looking forward to the two-DVD set.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Totoro is about everyone's childhood. It was a wonderful experience to sit through this movie. Miyazaki successfully captured every little detail in a child's action and emotion, which everyone of us could relate to at one point or another. The first time I saw the movie was in Chinese (Cantonese). Since then, I have seen it in several dubbed versions including the original Japanese track. After having the chance to compare the different versions - I have to say the Cantonese version is by far the most effective, beating its original track. There are several sound effects in the Cantonese version, including the voices of the two smaller totoros, which do no exist in the original track. If you get a chance to hold on to the Hong Kong-imported DVDs, you will find both the Japanese (2.0) and Cantonese (5.1) tracks with English subtitles, and the movie is presented in widescreen.*****/*****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is yet another masterpeice by my favourite director, Hayao Miyazaki. It's a beautiful adventure with very realistic-characters, and it has a unique feel to it; uplifting, but with depressing undertones. And to nit-pick at what someone else said, Totoro is not a gerble. Gerbles are rodents with long, rat-like tails. Totoro clearly is not a gerble. He's a spirit. Also, several people were complaining about the inadequicies of the Fox-dubbed DVD, and I just want to point out why the DVD is sub-par. A few years ago, Disney bought up the rights to several of Miyazaki's films (Princess Mononoke, Spirited Away, Castle in the Sky, and Kiki's Delivery Service to name a few, with more being prepared for release.) Way back when FOX bought the rights, in the early nineties, they only got the rights to produce a dubbed, full-screen version, I believe. (I don't recall this one ever having a theatrical run, but it just might have. I think it was direct to video.) Back then, very few people knew that anime was "more than just kids' cartoons," and the market for sub-titled anime was pretty small. Since DVD wasn't an issue back then, FOX didn't see a point in getting subtitling rights and wide-screen rights. (Also, for the early nineties, it's an EXCELLENT dub, and still is pretty good by today's standards.) Around the time that anime was getting more of a stronghold, Disney came along and made a deal with Studio Ghibli to get the rights to these movies. It's been aranged that Totoro's rights will be turned over to Disney in 2004, I believe, when it will be re-dubbed and re-released with all the extras and with other languages. Fox is just putting Totoro on DVD to a) make some money off of it while they can, and b) so that fans can have a copy of the Fox dub that won't deteriorate and will be able to withstand the years. Personally, I look foward to having both dubs on DVD and comparing them.</fullReview>

The characters are easy to empathize with, and the story is one that engages children from ages 5 to 75. I heartily recommend this film to anyone who loves animation, no matter what age.

		<fullReview>When I first learned that this movie had been released as a double feature with Grave of the Fireflies, I was, to say the least, confused. But now I definitely see why that was done.My Neighbor Totoro, once put into proper historical perspective, becomes a rather difficult film to watch, especially for someone born and raised in the country that put the Japanese in that situation all those many years ago. All the clues are there--the mother in the hospital, Kanta's hat, the setting, the dress, and particularly the way the mother's medical condition is never discussed. It doesn't come on as strong as Grave of the Fireflies; it's more an optimistic piece, an exercise in innocence and naiveity.Or rather, how children deal with painful realities.I hope I haven't given much away. Anyway, this is definitely among Miyazaki's best; and I would go as far as to say it was one of the best animated films ever made, except for the way in which it ends (too abruptly and perhaps too soon).Don't let the dub lead you to believe this is mere kiddie fare. While it can be watched with the family, anyone with a brain won't be able to swallow it that easily. (Methinks the realization that this ISN'T kiddie fare, contrary to what I've always been told, has sent me into more of a shock than anything else. ^_^)</fullReview>

We have most of the popular Disney films as well as things like Babe, Antz and Beethoven, etcSo was it for this reason that a friend insisted on sending me My Neighbour Totoro, citing it as one of his favourite films?I finally watched it last night, not having the slightest idea what it was or what it was about. What I got was a heart-warming, beautifully drawn and - well - decidely odd animated film from JapanTwo young Japanese sisters and their father move into a run-down shack in a rice-field area where they meet several "fairy tale" characters lving in the local woods, including the titular, Totoro, a giant - erm - gerbil. While having adventures with him and his smaller friends, they discover that their hospitalised Mother, due home soon, has developed an illness. The younger sister runs away to find the hospital and Totoro assists in the searchWhether this Totoro is a well known character in Japan (like - what? - the tooth fairy, or Father Christmas over here) or not I'm afraid I don't know. But the film is presented in such a way that you should know who the hell these characters areNow, as an adult, I found the film very touching. The fact that it was in Japanese with English sub-titles didn't bother me. But its obvious intended audience (i.e my children) would be hard pressed to sit through it purely because of that reason; however, the simple tale of innocent children exploring their new locations is one that should and, indeed, would appeal to my younger boysI must confess that I didn't share my friend's obvious joy in finding such a film - but then I wouldn't expect him to sit through my favourite "Krull" every month or so. But, as I said, it's beautifully drawn (apart from the Japanese habit of, for some reason, insisting that all children have mouths as wide as water melons!!), the music is surprisingly pleasant and the overall effect is one of feeling warm and fuzzy at the end, if a little bemused</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very sweet movie everyone should see</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While I'm not a huge anime fan, I've slowly becoming one and have had the pleasure of seeing some fabulous anime, including "My Neighbor Totoro". Loved all over the world, this is an animated film that's perfect for kids and adults of all ages. This is also a must-see for anyone who is interested in Japanese animation, as it's one of the classics, along with "Akira" and "Princess Mononoke".The movie begins with two little girls and their father moving into an old house in the Japanese countryside, while their mother is in a nearby hospital recovering from an undisclosed illness. Five-year old Mei and Satsuki, her older sister (about 10), help their father fix the house up, along with several of their neighbors. The girls' father is a professor at the university and leaves Mei in the care of Nanny, the elderly woman next door, while Satsuki is at school. When school is over, Satsuki and Mei are alone until their father comes home late at night. One day, Mei follows some tiny creatures into a forest where she meets Totoro, a huge, furry, teddy bear-like creature. Both girls befriend him and when they need help, Totoro is right there.Mr. Miyazaki is a genius when it comes to portraying children in their most pure form. Both girls are rowdy and loud and are very realistic for animated characters. There are many charming scenes including my favorite where Mei captures a dustbunny and runs off to find Satusuki. She bumps into Nanny for the first time and screams in fright, then runs around the door to get away. She then bumps into Nanny again and screams. It's an adorable scene, I can't do it justice here. The animation is very fluid and the characters move like real people. Just watch how Mei toddles around with her chubby legs bowed outwards, like a real pre-schooler.As much as I loved this movie, there's one key element I wasn't fond of: Totoro himself. He seemed more menacing than harmless, especially when he roared directly in the girls' faces, baring his huge teeth. Small children may find the noise frightening. Granted it is a cartoon, but Totoro looked like he was abusing illegal substances and acted like he was, too. I found nothing about Totoro charming; he was just one creepy critter. His bizarre behavior is probably more noticeable to older viewers, though, as children may be more in awe of the huge furry guy.Here's a few notes for parents who might be questioning whether this is a good movie for their child. "My Neighbor Totoro" is great as a small lesson in Japanese culture. Some tidbits: The huge rice paddies, the family bathing together as a bonding activity, the fact that shoes are not worn indoors (watch Satsuki walk around on her knees). If your child can handle Disney's "Bambi", this movie will be a piece of cake. There are a few minor parts parents may be concerned about, including the very unsafe operation of a bicycle and the childrens' emotional distress in several situations. These are all very minor and shouldn't interfere with anyone's enjoyment of this classic anime film. A 9/10.</fullReview>

As simple as Totoro's story is, it strikes all the right chords, triggering tender emotions that we needn't ignore as we grow older and more cynical. As I'm sure you've already read in the countless reviews, Totoro tells the story of two country children coming across magical creatures called totoro. As always, the animation is gorgeous, beautifully fluid and expressive and (unlike many American animated films) not over-animated. Although Totoro may lack in slam-bang action, I recommend it to anybody who is a fan of other Miyazaki films, animation in general, or an innocent, beautiful story that reminds us that we still possess that innocence.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A miracle - and worth making babies for...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Totoro joins a very small group of children's films which leave no nagging doubts that they might be bad for your kids to view repeatedly. Disney features constantly equate physical deformity with evil; Power Rangers teach that ugly people are evil AND need a good kicking; Pokemon considers that your kids have no attention span and need to be electro-shocked with constant stroboscopic, primary-coloured violence. Totoro preserves a magical simplicity which allows both the wonderment of child-like innocence and imaginary friends, and the doting of parents touched by such carefree marvelling. Everything in this film can be viewed through the eyes of the children or their parents, and such thematised appreciation of multiple audiences makes Disney's formula of anthropomorphised cuddly things throwing occasionally suggestive remarks at the older viewer seem cynically contrived. The Disney approach divides the audience in young and old, sneaking mild innuendo over the kids' heads and allowing the adults a sneaky smirk every now and then - Totoro is a joint viewing experience for parent and child, and has a message for both. I'm glad its been so well received in America and in the few places it has been seen in the UK. I was worried at first that it might be too slow for some children, and Totoro's appearances are few and fleeting. This is amongst the finest family films ever made, and I want to make babies just so they can see it. A little help, anyone?</fullReview>

Miyazaki is simply an amazing guy, and his Totoro, are cute, adorable and so, so cool!Apart from the Totoro themselves, there's the hilarious Cat Bus, and the undeniably sweet kid sister, Mei, who's the only one who can see the Totoro at first.Unlike Disney movies, Miyazaki never preaches to his audience, nor does he pander to the lowest common denominator. What you get, is a sweet, funny, and funny adventure that can be enjoyed by adults and children alike.For a 2D film to make you just curl-up on the sofa, and think that "life can't get any better than this", then watch this film. Alternatively, watch it as a double-bill with "Kiki's Delivery Service" and/or "Whisper Of The Heart" (all Studio Ghibli creations!)</fullReview>

Nonetheless, this is a wonderful movie, despite the voice-overs by Saturday-morning rejects. I was disappointed to hear Roger Ebert (who generally liked the film) characterize the children in the film as "saccharine sweet." It seems Americans have become so accustomed to smart-mouthed brats on TV and in movies that when they see children on the screen actually behaving like children, they seem "saccharine sweet." Anyway, Miyazaki finally really did learn his lesson, and now has films are handled exclusively by Disney, who naturally do a slick job.

		<shortDescription>A masterpiece of animation. Evokes feelings which I thought I had lost with childhood.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The things which children must cope with are immense and overwhelming. I think myself lucky to have been safely steered away from such issues as death and loss at an early age, but now that I have seen Tonari no Totoro, I realize that a child's ability to overcome, and the power of the imagination in order to overcome would have helped me through the trauma.Tonari no Totoro deals with such issues when it takes the story of two young sisters, moving to the country with their father as they wait for their mother to recover from some debilitating illness. But it is not as depressing as it sounds. In fact, it has to be one of the most uplifting and life affirming movies I have ever seen. Why? Because animator Hayao Miyazaki has such an acute understanding of the mindset -- and the imagination -- of children. Children deal with emotions they can't understand by creating worlds. By diving into their imagination, they are able to express these emotions in a positive, uplifting way.And this is how the two sisters of this story deal with the potential loss of their mother. Projecting their problems through a hole they encounter in the forest, they create an imaginary world of forest beasts which act as playmates and protectors. And the power of their beliefs then make these creatures real.I gave this video to my niece and nephew before they moved into a new house in a new town. And although their experience didn't exactly parallel the trauma that the characters in the film experienced, the similarities were sufficient enough so that as soon as they had moved into the new house, and were trying to deal with the unfamiliar surroundings, they had discovered a hole in a hedge, which they subsequently named the "Totoro hole", where they could crawl into and find a world all their own, amongst a world they were completely unfamiliar with. Within weeks, they had introduced all the neighborhood children (their new friends) to the hole, as well as to the film. Totoro had taken over their new neighborhood!As an adult, you might find yourself sinking into feelings much like this. A sadness for the loss of the ability to tap into our imaginations in order to overcome all obstacles. But it also will open things up inside you that you thought were long buried over. Disney could never achieve such a complex mix of emotions.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautiful animation.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film has some of the most beautiful and realistic animation I have ever seen. Many of the backgrounds are so well painted that they like they are photographs. I was told that after the violence and mass destruction in his previous film `Tenku no shiro Rapyuta' (`Castle in the Sky: Laputa'), mothers in Japan were distressed that they had taken their very young children to see the film thinking it was going to be just a kiddy film. Supposedly, this film is his response to their outrage. This is the kiddy film to beat all kiddy films. There is no villain in this film. None. In spite of that, the story does not suffer at all. I personally found the story to be quite charming, very entertaining and totally unique. I must confess however, that I cannot stand the American voices used in the English dub of this film. If you have a chance to watch it in the original Japanese with subtitles I strongly encourage it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lighthearted, but intelligent look at the world through childrens' eyes.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Classifying this as mere anime and thinking that fans of anime are the only people who might enjoy this film doesn't really do it justice at all. It's a beautifully simple tale that intelligently mixes lighthearted whimsy with serious subject matter, managing to entertain without being trite or patronizing to adults or children. Two girls move with their father to the countryside to be near the hospital where their mother is recovering from a serious illness. They meet and befriend magical creatures living under a giant tree on the hill next to their home, the Totoros, who in subtle and gentle ways help the girls deal with the worry and confusion of being separated from their mother. Adults will see a tale about what it's like to be a child in a world that can be sometimes wondrous and sometimes mean, and children will love the girls' adventures with the adorable Totoros. The Totoros themselves come in different sizes and look somewhat like a cross between a cat, a bear, and a rabbit. They are charged with keeping the natural world in order and perform duties such as making the wind blow and seeds sprout from the ground. The film is not afraid to take a slow serene pace and concentrate on seemingly unimportant background details such as trees, clouds, and streams. The rural surroundings that the story takes place in (Japan in the 1950's) are so lovingly rendered and intricately detailed that I found myself wishing I could visit and stay for a while. As a parent, I couldn't find anything in the film remotely unsuitable for children. The world the girls inhabit, while at times sad, is filled with friends and caring adults who actually cherish the childrens' innocence. And while not only being entertaining for children, its gentle treatment of its mature subject matter may very well wind up serving as a starting point for discussion of coping with sadness or other negative emotions. I believe anyone who can remember what it was like to be a child will find something to enjoy here, and I look forward very much to seeing more of Mr. Miyazaki's work.(please note that I viewed the dubbed version released by Fox some years ago)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's one of those movies that is breathtakingly perfect in every scene, every line of dialogue.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There was an anime festival on as part of the Sydney Olympics arts program; my SO Liz wanted to get a season pass and spend all week watching movies, but we only managed to get tickets for one flick. Fortunately, however, it was an absolutely brilliant one: "My Neighbour Totoro".If you ever hear about this being shown on the big screen, grab tickets immediately; if not, get it on video. Even if you don't like anime, it doesn't matter. It's one of those movies that is breathtakingly perfect in every scene, every line of dialogue.It's not your typical anime; no sex, no violence, no giant robots, appropriate for people of any age without being a kiddies movie. Just some wonderfully realised characters, and some astonishingly beautiful animation.The visual style is very similar to some of Tenchi Muyo (which was probably heavily influenced by My Neighbour Totoro), for those of you familiar with that. It's one of the few where the dubbed version is as good as the subbed, too; the English language voice acting is magnificent.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A scant few movies actually contain a bit of "real" magic. Not silly TV witch magic, but the magic that children know: The magic and wonder of our world as seen by a child.There's more "magic" in one of Totoro's little seed pouches than all of Disney's films combined.A brash remark? Or is this film really that good? Akira Kurosawa once rated this as one of the best movies of all time. And most of his selected movies weren't Japanese and NONE of others were animated.Siskel and Ebert apparently argued about this movie over the course of two shows, ending with Siskel watching the movie again and changing his "thumb down" to "thumb up".This movie works brilliantly on all levels. And while there ARE better movies than this one (none of them animated), I can count them easily on my fingers.Totoro can work his magic on anyone from ages 2 to 92 (I tried these both, so I know). But, in order for him to do that, you have to ignore the ludicrously lame front cover (shame on Fox).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If only there was more animation like this</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sure, I enjoy hyperviolent John Woo and Brian DePalma-type flicks as much as the next guy, but films such as this one are a nice change of pace. I really wish Hayao Miyazaki's films were more readily avalible in the US, I've yet to see a less than amazing film by this master animator. I really hope the theatrical release of the masterpiece Princess Mononoke (which I've only been able to see on video) causes people to check out this and other Miyazaki films. The film contains some wonderful, hilarious moments like when the Totoro discovers how to use an umbrella, and the "catbus". The score by Joe Hisaishi is very good too, along with Ryuichi Sakamoto (The Last Emperor), Akira Ifukube (Godzilla), Masaru Sato (Yojimbo), and Toru Takemitsu (Ran), Hisaishi is my favorite Japanese film composer.I highly reccomend this film for both children and adults, if I had children, I would definitely show it to them. I would show them there's more to animation than cheesy 30 minute toy commercials. If we were living in a more perfect world, this is what would be showing instead of Pokemon: The First Movie. And adults, don't feel silly renting this for yourself. Even though i'm an adult, I never for a moment felt silly watching this film. The same goes for other very good animated films that are supposedly for kids, like Toy Story 2 and Nick Park's wonderful Wallace and Gromit shorts. The Fox/Streamline English-dubbed version is very good, way better than most English dubs of anime. This version is good to show to younger kids who may have trouble following subtitles. Still, I really hope this film gets released on DVD someday and has the original Japanese language track. This film will come as a real surprise to anyone who thinks all anime is gory sci-fi, not that there aren't some films in that category I like.</fullReview>

It perfectly captures the fascination with the elements as well as the unknown.</fullReview>

But a few years later I saw it in my video store and gave it a chance, and it has become one of my favorite films of all time. It's beautifully animated and was directed/written by Miyazaki, who I think is the master of Anime (believe me, I've seen a lot of Anime in my day). The story is about two girls who move to the countryside and befriend a friendly forest monster, who gives them hope and helps them out. Great script, great animation and they adapted the Japanese songs perfectly. A must see film for all ages.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tonari no Totoro holds a special place among all the animated movies I had ever watched as the movie that makes me remember what's it like to be a child again. Totoro reminds us what it feels to see the world around us as a child, where everything is new, fresh, and exciting. This movie also contains some of the best scenes ever created in an Anime. There is a lot of HEART in this movie. It is also clear that rather than designing the visuals for the sake of merely making them look pretty/ appealing, the designers uses their sensitivity to convey how interesting the world looks from their point of view. This results in a movie that connects to the audience in so many ways. This movie certainly has the charm and "magic" that had been lost in so many recent animated features. I highly recommend this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best animated films of all times</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've heard so much about this film for years but never had the time too. However I bought myself the DVD, along with a Blu-Ray version of 'Howl's Moving Castle', another of Miyazaki's great work. And with its fantastic storytelling and 2D animation I was fascinated by its work. The characters are memorable, the music brings out some emotion and the story was nice and simple and is not like the many kids films were it needs to have a hero, a villain etc. it's just a story of two little girls who have an imagination of a bear character known as Totoro. As kids films do have a message, like most of the director's great work, it's hard to underly what the message is of the film, most idiots may 'think' that Totoro is the symbol of death, when really he isn't as the mother in the hospital was OK, look at the end credits, and that the shoe that was found in the pond was not Mei's at all. To me I think there is no message, it's just a fun film to escape the depths of reality. As of the voice acting for the US audience I prefer the Disney version. I never grew up with the Fox one but I've seen it and the voice acting is just stiff, loud and awful, I'm sorry if I've offended fans of the 1993 dub, but not everyone is a nostalgic hipster and are not blinded by the rose coloured glasses of nostalgia. The Disney's version, before anyone asks Disney is the distributor and dubbing work of the Ghibli films for the English audience. The latter version is better as the voice actors were better. Their voices are more relaxed, realistic and great, especially the fanning sisters. I think Totoro is one of the greatest animated films of all time and probably one of the greatest movies of all time. It's a very inspiring piece of work that it fuels up my dream of becoming an animator and writer. If you have the chance to see the movie with your kids or if you're a big Miayzaki or Studio Ghibli fan I recommend buying this DVD.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Definitely liked this one, especially Mei, such an adorable bundle of joy (reminds me of my niece). I'm on a mission to watch all of Miyazaki's works, and he has yet to disappoint. So far I've seen Spirited Away and Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind (skipped Castle in the Sky, that will be next). Definitely not my average film where I have to think about all the themes in the movie. I'm always having to look them up because I don't actively analyze what each character/scene represents. I enjoy how Miyazaki makes me think about what each film of his represents.I watched it with English dub (starring the Fanning sisters) and it was superb. They really made their characters to life. Enjoyed hearing Superman's voice as well (Tim Daly as Tatsuo). Was a little upset at first because I wanted to watch it in the original Japanese dub, but I watched it with my sister and she doesn't do subtitles. Time to watch it again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My Neighbor Totoro is a lovely piece of animation that anyone can enjoy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When you think of Japanese animation, Studio Ghibli is often the first thing that comes to mind. When you think of Studio Ghibli, one beloved character is always thought of: Totoro, the large, grey wood spirit first introduced in 1988's My Neighbor Totoro. The lovable character, and the movie he was introduced in, are very beloved not only in Japan, but also worldwide. This all comes with good reason: My Neighbor Totoro is a lovely piece of animation that truly anyone can enjoy. My Neighbor Totoro follows the story of a family consisting of three members: Tatsuo Kusakabe and his two daughters, ten year old Satsuki and four year old Mei. The family moves to a house in rural Japan in order to be closer to their sick mother, who is in a hospital in a nearby town. Their house appears to be "haunted," as seen when Satsuki and Mei run across little black creatures known as "soot gremlins." However, they don't mind it too much. One day, Mei is playing in the yard, where which she discovers a strange white creature roaming in the grass. Chasing the creature, she discovers a small tunnel leading into a large camphor tree located nearby. Falling into a hole, she plops right into the den of a sleeping spirit, known as Totoro. Soon discovered by Satsuki as well, the children go on several magical adventures, discovering more about life and friendship along the way. My Neighbor Totoro is a rather simple movie, but that's why it's such an interesting one. There's no important conflict between two characters that causes tension. There are no evil villains or big battles between factions. Of course, the fate of the sick mother is there, but the appearance of Totoro or the other forest spirits is comforting in the few times of distress. It's no wonder Totoro is one of the most beloved characters in anime. Hayao Miyazaki, who wrote the film, manages to make such a simple film into a masterpiece that can be enjoyed by anyone. The movie has a way with making images stand out, thanks to the animation. My Neighbor Totoro nails the atmosphere of rural Japan, and is full of bright, luscious colors. The characters are all designed well, with very charming facial expressions that can make anyone smile or laugh. The film also contains scenes that are almost unforgettable. After viewing the movie, the bus stop scene and the Catbus will be burned into your memory forever. The English voice acting is great as well. Satsuke and Mei are voiced by real-life sisters Dakota and Elle Fanning, both of whom are absolutely adorable. Occasionally, Dakota seems a little too young to play a ten year old girl, but it's not something that takes away from the overall film. Tim Daly voices the father, and Pat Carroll voices "Granny," the Kusakabes' new neighbor. Many people might turn away from My Neighbor Totoro, seeing it as nothing more than a movie for kids. Sure, it will appeal to kids, but anyone of any age can find enjoyment from this movie. Everyone can relate to the themes given off, as just about everyone has had imaginary friends like Totoro (who may or may not be imaginary; that's up to you to decide). The animation is stunning, the characters are fun, and the Fanning sisters' voice acting is adorable. My Neighbor Totoro is one of the best movies to come out of Studio Ghibli, and will always be seen as a classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not especially interesting, but it carries with it a positive ethic even if it's little more than an animated aside.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My Neighbour Totoro is a sweet, pleasing little romp; an animation with some colourful landscapes and sweet, likable child leads whose frolicking and sheer bounce are often the engine room to the film's otherwise empty sense of energy. Sadly, and for all its plaudits, the film comes off as ultimately a bit of an inconsequence - it isn't exciting, nor particularly memorable: there is little conflict; little drama and the film is extraordinarily light on narrative and character. If I told you the film was about a child encountering monsters given these things, you might raise an eyebrow. However, if I told you the monsters, instead of being scary, were themselves scared of an energetic, boisterous human presence then you might be able to put two-and-two together in that the animation is less interested in delivering the generic thrills and spills that come with such a premise and more interested in exploration and revisionism. That's fine, of course; but when the charm of such an idea has worn off and the approach to have it both ways in its grounded depiction of a dramatic reality (alá Ocean Waves or Only Yesterday) mixed with fruiter, more escapist Ghibli fare driven by encounters with odd animals, we are not left with much in which to get interested nor with which to stay invested.At its heart is a tale of a young child meeting creatures not of this world, but the creatures are more interested in catching up on sleep than anything else. They meet, hang out, learn to be in one another's presence, get along fine and that's the end of it. This is, of course, only to a face value; look deeper and you'll see that this is a film about a child being brave in the face of new surroundings; of learning how to act in the company of strangers; of accepting predicaments and, it seems, coming to quite enjoy eating one's vegetables.Two playful young sisters named Satsuki and Mei are in the process of moving into a new home with their father in decades-ago Japan, an abode in the country; secluded and rural. Their existence is happy, jovial; they are easily excited and very enthusiastic in their nature. Upon arrival, there are some relatively uninteresting frolicking around; the kids get wind of would-be real/unreal creatures that already occupy the premises: little grey sprites that live in the walls and dart about when no one's looking out of fear of the fresh human occupants. This allows the film to play with a child's fear of the dark; their gradual discomfort of being in a new space and the sense of excitement abound with all these things combined as exploration beckons, and we're never sure if horror or soft-core adventure is the order of the day here. It's both ? on occasion not either. Whatever the choice, rarely does the film feel like it's going anywhere or with the aspiration to truly take off.The kids lack a mother. She rears up out of the blue later on, in an ill-advised manner when it's revealed she's suffering from depression. It's here the issues with the overall approach to My Neighbour Totoro rear up, since it was never that sort of film in the first place, and I find it difficult not to resent the piece for dragging us down that path when the whole subplot arrives. At the core of it lies a friendship Mei strikes up with the titular Totoro, her "neighbour" as it were, in that he lives nearby just beyond the bushes and undergrowth of the gardens. Totoro is an animal not of this world; a sort of egg shaped creature who looks a little like a rabbit but is about as big as a small tree He sleeps. He sleeps a lot. He says very little, and is enormous, but appears friendly in spite of the fact he could fit all of Mei inside of his mouth.Where he is docile, she is this continuous presence of excitement and activity but the film cannot muster up much excitement or interest when these two of such a binary opposition come together. In spite of the character's inherent lack of anything at all that may be interesting, it hasn't stopped the companies shipping millions of Totoro die-cast toys; this is in spite of him essentially being someone so uncharacteristic, and so dull in their existence, that I'm hard pressed not to say they are the most lifeless, least likable Ghibli character I can think who's of a supernatural sort. Totoro has his obligatory access to all sorts of magic and friends and avenues to adventure, and Mei comes to interact with them. They fly around and plant seeds and everyone has fun. At least, it looked like they did. The film carries on. Everyone's getting along fine; no one believes Mei: of course they don't, although the father finds room to play along with the fantasy. The whole thing is sufficient, innocuous nonsense that's ultimately too childish to explore the darker passages inherent in within it, and too inconsequential to motivate much interest in the central fantasy tract.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hmm... My Neighbor Tororo.... It's been a long time since I saw this movie. What do I think of it? I love this movie. This is the first Hayao Miyazaki film I ever saw. The story is original and creative. There's a lot of characters that you will like such as Satsuki and her little sister Mei, their parents, Mr. and Mrs. Kusakabe, the mysterious creature Totoro, the mystical Catbus, the girls' grandmother, and Kanta, who I think is Satsuki's rival. The artwork is phenomenal. Finally, the original song, My Neighbor Totoro, warmed my heart. I loved this movie and I hope to see this again soon. Starring Dakota and Elle Fanning as Satsuki and Mei, Tim Daly as Mr. Kusakabe, Lea Salonga as Mrs. Kusakabe, Frank Welker(From Scooby-Doo and Pound Puppies) as Totoro and the Catbus, Pat Carroll(From The Little Mermaid and Pound Puppies) as the Grandma, and Paul Butcher as Kanta Okagi.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A thing of beauty</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is definitely one of those astonishingly high-spirited movies that you can simply sit back and enjoy, mainly due to the heart-warming tale and beautiful animations. Hayao Miyazaki did an amazing job, delivering one of the prettiest pictures that any kid or grown-up can love right from the start. One might even say that it is better than classic Disney pictures.It doesn't provide a strong and elaborate storyline, like Princess Mononoke or Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind, and doesn't imply any moral guidance or specific messages. And that's a very good sign, noting that the movie is supposed to bring out all the positive emotions in the viewer through its magical aura and all those enormously joyful characters and creatures appearing on-screen.Looking at the two young girls, Mei and Satsuki, jumping freely and laughing about no particular things made me want to be a child again. Miyazaki is able to move our minds and make us see that childhood is the most fantastic time of our lives, and being able to use the full potential of one's imagination should be glorified.Even though it has an element of sadness, with the girls' mom staying in the hospital, it is so neatly placed in the storyline that it doesn't spoil the tremendous fun of watching My Neighbor Totoro. It's simply an idyllic tale, accompanied by a taste of magic and fantasy. Tell me, who won't be able to adore those fluffy Totoros and their marvelous abilities? Every time they appeared I wanted them to stay a little longer and mesmerize me with their sparkling glow of glee.The English dubbing is very decent, the voices were chosen appropriately so that they would seem like they were taken straight out of the Japanese version.All in all, I must say that My Neighbor Totoro really tickled my dreams of being a child all over again with its hypnotizing beauty. It was able to show me yet again that the fantastic world of Japanese anime genre has so many wonderful pictures to offer. And if you really want to start your adventure with Miyazaki, I bet that watching this picture will be the best possible way to do so.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A charming film; however not one of Studio Ghibli's strongest productions</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'd firstly like to say that I am a HUGE fan of the movies created by Studio Ghibli; they are unlike anything else and this is the case for all of the right reasons.However, I was somewhat disappointed with "My Neighbour Totoro" as, although the charm and imagination of Ghibli productions is there, the actual story-telling techniques seem inadequate for such a great studio. In terms of the positives of this movie, it has the cute, crazy, original and adventurous style that fans of Japanese anime and especially Studio Ghibli will know and love. In addition to this, the story is one that will probably put a smile on your face at various points. Furthermore, the characters are, for the majority of the movie's run-time, very likable.However, whilst the style that Ghibli is famous for makes this film a good one, the actual film-making is just not up to the same standard as some of Hayao Miyazaki's other productions, such as Spirited Away and The Castle of Cagliostro. Firstly, some of the characters are introduced in a manner suggestive of a depth to them, however this complexity is never really provided in some cases. We are, essentially, made to want to know more about some characters (their motives, origins, thoughts), however this thirst for knowledge is not entirely satisfied. This limited feel to the movie is furthered by the fact that the whole plot seems slightly too trivial and lacks a driving purpose. Finally, considering the fact that the run-time is around 80minutes, the pacing is quite peculiar, which left, me personally, wanting more to happen quickly, however this desire is never really met.Overall, this is, undoubtedly, a very good film, and worth a watch for any fans of Japanese anime. However, underneath the wonderful style, originality and creativity Studio Ghibli invoke, is a fairly shallow production that relies far more on its charm as opposed to its production values.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love this movie. Miyazaki can do a movie like no other and his magic shows in any movie. I started noticing the influence WW2 had on film makes like this and I think this movie captures it in a fun childish way that does not loose it power. The character design was amazing from the girls to all of the creatures. I think that Miyazaki can pull off taking a pretty empty shot and using to keep the pace of the movie without it being obvious, but then it picks up and it just turns into a whirlwind of magic. The tragic nature of a lot of Japanese film and the way of coping with it by creating a fantastical world where dreams literally come true. I think one of the nice things at the end of the movie that no one including the parents and the audience don't believe in the magic that propels the movie. At times it is a little scary, but in a good way, but nothing horrible every really happens. The only reason this movie does not get a 10 is because when watching any Miyazaki film one inevitably compares it to his other films and I do not think this top spirited away, but has a place in every movie library.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kids can't get enough of this one</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We've gotten our two boys, ages 2 and 1, a lot of Miyazaki's anime. Some of them didn't even come with English tracks or subtitles, but that hasn't stopped our kids from clamoring to see them again and again. Sometimes in the same day. While they both like Howl's Moving Castle, The Cat Returns, and Spirited Away, this is their favorite, by far. They hear the theme start and they squeal with delight. Until we got the English-dub, they were starting to sing the theme song in Japanese.The story is easy to follow, the characters are easy for kids to identify with, and the Totoros are just delightful. The only downside of this movie, in my opinion, is that the English musical soundtrack doesn't have Sonya Isaac's "Hey Let's Go!," which is our favorite song in the film. I haven't found this song yet as an audio file and I know my kids would get a kick out of hearing it in the car.Can't recommend this movie highly enough. I've easily seen it over 100 times and still haven't tired of it myself.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Over the years my taste in movies changed from kid movies, to more adult (not porn) based films. I will still watch a kid's movie know and then if I have heard that it is really good or really funny. I became of fan of Anime movies some years ago, and was hoping to see more in my life time. I read a lot about Grave of the Fireflies and upon watching it, made me feel human again. I heard about Tonari no Totoro around the same time I heard of Grave of the Fireflies, however I did not have the money to obtain Tonari no Totoro.I had the chance to watch this film and loved it when I watched it. Basically the film is about a family, two sisters and their father who move into a new house. The sisters see this spirit who takes them throughout the forest and other parts of the land.The story is well told and the animation is top notch.If you like cute stories like this, then watch this film..</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>There should be more films like this</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So simple, so poetic. Two young girls move to the country and discover to helpful furry friends. "My Neighbor Tortoro" is a celebration of childhood and imagination and the film is executed brilliantly. The plot is the least of the film's worries. It just goes with the flow, and yet it's fully allowed to. The major conflict in the film doesn't arrive until past the middle, but its odd narrative is more of its subtle beauty. Without to much apparent conflict, we're invited to watch the flashes of fish in the river and uncover odd critters that live in the attic. And so, the magic in the film subtly blends with childhood discovery. There's tadpoles in a puddle, and cute little critters that disappear when chased. There's a big critter with an inviting stomach. The hand painted fluid and organic animation is beyond gorgeous and very appropriate for the earthy flair to this film. Speaking of earth, I find films like these to be the best advocates of environmental protection. We're not padded over the head with anything, but the image of a bottle in a clear lake leaves a strong impact to all viewers. That of course is just another side theme in the film, the importance of nature, and more importantly, it's a non-objectable message. It breaths for me like a painting, and yet the atmosphere is so relaxing and engaging. I don't hesitate to accept the world the little girls create/experience. The messages are those that everyone can relate to. I never grew up Japan (or found any magical creatures that I can remember), but I could certainly identify with the film's two main characters. And if you didn't have a great childhood, sit back and enjoy the adventures of the two eager little girls in this wonderful little film that's also a landmark in animation.</fullReview>

Is it like an owl or like a fairy of forest? Nobody knows it, but everybody can imagine about Totoro. Actually Totoro doesn't exist, but I unconsciously believed that "My Neighbor Totoro" is a true story as if Totoro were living with us. This is partly because, this movie's pictures and family life are very realistic.All of this movie's pictures are drawn by Miyazaki himself and staff members. They are more impressive than CG's movies, so pictures are really really nice.I love this movie's everything such as its pictures, story line, characters, and music.

Totoro visits their house at night and acorns are sprouted and grow in a moment.Those scenes really depict children's dream. Whenever I see this movie,I can identify myself with Mei.This is because maybe I looked like her when I was of her age.The after reasons I can identify myself with her is that I have an older sister and I'm as curious as Mei.Various characters appear in this movie and I believe you surely can identify yourself with one of them.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Have you ever seen Tonari no Totoro, My Neighbor Totoro? It will make you very peaceful and gentle. It will also remind you of childhood and your own home! My Neighbor Totoro is the story of Satsuki and Mei, two sisters who move into a haunted house in order to be near their sick mother who is in the hospital. During this difficult time, wood creatures and spirits come to be their aid, including the Totoro, a furry, egg-shaped cross between a rabbit and a bear with a wicked roar. Generally speaking, this is a fairly-tale and kid's movie, but I don't think so. At the first of the movie, a message is projected, "I came to bring what your lost". This means that this movie is for adults, doesn't it? You can get back what you lost!This is the movie all the Japanese love!!! Although this is an old movie, you can see many many many people who love this movie in japan now!! Satsuki and Mei's House the reproduced scene of this movie can be seen at EXPO AICHI, JAPAN. This spot is much more popular than other attraction!!Watch this movie!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let me just say before I actually write the review, that I'm not all that big a fan of Anime. That being said, I'd seen two Studio Ghibli films before watching My Neighbor Totoro, and I enjoyed both. (Tales From Earthsea, and Howl's Moving Castle.) I also did a bit of research on the film itself before watching it, because being on tumblr I see a lot of references, quotes and insight on the film, and I came across the Murder Theory, and it intrigued me even more.Although it had a bit of a slow pace, and a running time of an hour and twenty-nine minutes, I made sure I downloaded the Original English Dubbed version, from when Fox owned the rights.I expected a lot from this film, in part because of the fanbase it has here on tumblr, and also because the two Studio Ghibli films I'd seen previous to that were quite enjoyable. All of this being said, I found the film quite bland in all honesty. The film never reveals what was actually ailing the Mother, and keeping her hospitalized. The film never explained where Mei went, while her sister was losing her mind trying to find her. There were a lot of loose ends in my opinion. I also never understood how the being came to be called Totoro, all 'Totoro' did was growl and yell, I suppose you'd call it yelling. Maybe I'm missing something, I don't know. But from my point of view, there was a lack of luster in this film. Totoro was only on screen for maybe 15 minutes in total, and I really had trouble understanding it.5.9/10</fullReview>

Long story short, two girls and their father await for the mother to come out of the hospital. Meanwhile wonderful things happen, like the friendship with a huge teddy bear like creature which seems to be a forest spirit.Saying that, I am 28 years old and I liked it a lot :), even if not so much as other Myiazaki cartoons, so it's not only for kids. It did seem a bit long for me at times, but after its 90 minutes length I felt bad that it ended so soon.

I've watched them all multiple times and will watch them again, but I think it'll be a rare night when I pull this out of the collection for a re-view. I suppose I'm happy to have seen it at least once though.This movie doesn't really have much of a story, and if it weren't for Totoro being around, it would be pretty mundane. It picks up a little as Totoro helps the little girl find her sister and then go off to visit her mom in the hospital. If you can get them to sit still long enough, kids should love it because it still has that Miyazaki feel. It just seems like it was made a little more for kids than his other movies were.</fullReview>

I absolutely love the movie, and when they get a little older my girls will get to enjoy it. The movie itself is pure magic, I love umbrella scene and the scene where the catbus first appears. I STILL have the VHS copy of the fox dub since I cant find the FOX version on DVD, although as soon as I find it I intend to buy the fox version DVD.

		<fullReview>This was a wonderful movie in how imaginative it was. I would completely recomend it for family viewing and if i ever have any children i am sure it will be one of thier favorites.My complaints are that, while being very imaginative, the movie was rather empty when it came to plot when it came to depth and meaning. Some rather important points were not even mentioned, such as why the girls' Mother was in the hospital, and what exactly a totoro is. Also, there really was no set plot, it was more of a story that left me feeling relativly empty when the film ended. I felt it needed to be longer (which would take away from the appeal to children), or have a sequal, which i dont see any reason for it not to.I did enjoy a film on a certain level, but would not recomend it to an adult unless they were a fan of animation or Miyazaki's work. If you have any children on the other hand, i couldn't recomend it enough. My only remaining hope is that Disney releases the rest of Miyazaki's work, especially Nausicaa, which i cannot recomend enough if you can find a copy with subtitles.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie makes me smile. It's adorable, beautifully picturized and I never want it to end.I recently watched it again with my two year old nephew and I was apprehensive it was too quiet and long for him. To make matters worse I only have the Japanese version with English subtitles. I thought he would fidget and get bored.Boy, was I wrong. He was hooked from start to finish. Totoro, whom he categorized as big mouse, scared him a little. He backed away to the end of the room when Totoro was introduced but when he smiled my nephew came back to his spot to smile back at him. Every time the girls would laugh my nephew laughed. He did the tree dance with them. Whenever totoro growled he growled back. I never realized how immersive the experience was until now. Even during the quieter moments he could not take his eyes off because the colours, environment, sounds would not allow it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Totoro + Catbus = Happiness</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I find really interesting that Totoro and Grave of the Fireflies were released in a double bill. More than the economical reasons behind it, I find interesting how both movies are focused on personal interactions (brother-sister, and sister-sister in Totoro), and how this can be drastically affected by the conditions. You might think that the siblings from Grave of the Fireflies could have had a similar life to the siblings in Totoro, if not for the circumstances.What I loved about the movie: - They way they portrayed rural life in the 50s was really amazing. It reminded me of the lifestyle my dad told me he experienced when growing up. If you ever had the chance of visiting a small rural town, where technology had not made an impact yet, you could notice the type of lifestyle they portray in Totoro.- The plot is simple, and even though there are fantasy elements (Totoros and the catbus), they balance them with real life events (without making a lot of drama about it), such as the mom being sick, and the reaction of both kids to it.The balance between fantasy and reality is achieved beautifully in Ghibli movies, and this one is among the best ones at achieving that balance. No wonder this movie is an animation classic Score (9)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A cute, endearing film, which doesn't need dissection via formal analysis. It appeals to the inner child, no matter what age. It brings to life all the fantastical cinematic elements that transcend what it means to be human. Vivid colours, cute characters, I was entranced instantly. I felt I could happily cry during this cuddly film without fear of scorn or censure. Once a film forces an emotional response, it has served its purpose.While a short feature flick, it is undoubtedly the flagship of Miyazaki's career, not only providing the iconic Studio Ghibli logo, but raising the bar for all animated movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is pretty much one of Hayao Miyazaki's most original pieces of work as it is so genuinely magical. Not being a child, I'm not sure if children would like this film as it can be slow paced. However I enjoyed the film because it was such a great avenue for imagination that it almost felt like I was in the shoes of the two little girls and discovering the things about the place they live in. This is a great film to reflect upon after watching, however not so great whilst watching it. As mentioned before it was almost boring at the start, but then the characters are introduced to a brilliant mythical world that ensures entertainment. A thing that was surprising about this film was how emotionally connected I felt to the characters and the situation with their ill mother, this ability to find an emotional link is what makes Studio Ghibl films so enjoyable and unique. And above all this movie is very cute in almost all aspects.My Neighbor Totoro= 7.8</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A nearly perfect movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is really my daughter's movie, and while she's watched it dozens of times I'm always happy to watch it with her one more time. I've seen many Miyazaki movies, but this is far and away the best. In fact, one of the best movies I've ever seen.It's hard to explain what makes it so good. Somehow, every scene, every frame of the movie fits perfectly into every other. The story is simple and straightforward, yet dreamy and otherworldly, and at the same time realistic.Two girls and their dad move into a country house. Mummy is in the hospital. Weird things happen in and around the house, suggesting the presence of supernatural, but benign creatures. The girls squabble, the neighbour boy is shy, Daddy is forgetful, Mommy is loving and remote, neighbour old woman becomes accepted as substitute Granny.Gradually, tension rises, because mommy is not getting better, and the girls must cope on their own. The older girl has to learn to be a substitute mom, and it's not easy. The younger girl starts acting out, and eventually gets into difficulties. But Totoro knows how to help.This must be the sort of movie that makes directors cry with frustration. It's so close to perfect, and yet it's impossible to see how they did it. It's simply a great movie, one of the best ever. Literally the sort of thing that makes you smile when you see the cover, even though you've seen the movie dozens of times.But obviously you can put off the joy of discovering this gem for a while yet. It will wait for you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This cartoon I watched on VCR when I was very very young, it was actually made the year I was born. It has grown up with me ever since, and a lot of things that happen to be in reality gives me flashbacks to this wonderful film.This Ghibli production is so meaningful to me because the music is elegantly composed, the artwork is beautifully drawn. This is much more than a cartoon. Everything in this movie is so moving, from when the two girls wait for their father to come home from work, to picking up logs from outside the howling wind, and picking up a corn for their mother. It is so real yet so fairy tale like but minus the superficial elements, it puts you through a roller coaster of emotions.This will always be my favourite film, it shows the innocence of childhood and the simplicity of children yet how complex they can be.The characters are brilliantly put together.I watched this in Cantonese, and it is absolutely amazing. I've also watched it in English, and sadly, it is no match!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So freaking ADORABLE!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My Neighbor Totoro is Studio Ghibli's crown jewel, and for a reason. No other film captures the innocence and wonder of childhood so perfectly, yet also takes the viewer to an emotional roller-coaster with lovable characters and a magical atmosphere. Totoro will leave anyone with a soul smiling for hours after finishing it.To count the plot of Totoro is next to pointless, as there hardly is one. Two girls move to a new house with their dad and they meet the forest spirits. That's it. Totoro doesn't exist to tell a story, it exists to spark the wonder and joy of childhood in anyone who's ever lived it. The scenes which the mere thought of can make you smile are almost too many to count: the first encounter with Totoro, the magical flying top ride, the cat bus and so on. Magical is truly the key word here, and the adorability reaches almost unbearable levels.The visuals have truly stood the test of time. Despite having been released only 2 years after Castle in the Sky and simultaneously with Grave of the Fireflies, the visuals are thoroughly convincing. Backgrounds are detailed and the animation is smooth and realistic. Butas with any Ghibli film, the true might of Totoro lies in its atmosphere. It captures the innocence of childhood without feeling pandering or idyllic. The characters and places feel real, and not some faraway fantasy land: the kid next door can be mean, buses don't always arrive on time, the characters aren't perfect. Partly this is thanks to the absolutely MARVELOUS Japanese voice cast who bring every character fully to life, the highlight being the two girls for whom we truly feel. When the tension racks up a bit towards the end you will truly feel the desperate confusion they're going through. One could keep going for hours like this. Totoro is as good as all-ages (and that is truly the case here, don't you dare say otherwise) films can get. That's all I can say.Recommendation: A must-see for EVERYONE.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My Neighbor Totoro ? Miyazaki, 1988</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My Neighbor Totoro is in my honest opinion one of the best movies I ever had the chance to see. It's absolutely perfect in every respect: the soundtrack is simple and beautiful, the animation is of excellent quality, with beautiful painting landscapes, the characters are amazingly realistic and is perhaps the ultimate children's movie. It's a flawless diamond of cinema and was rightly included among the 250 greatest movies ever made list by Sign and Sound.One day I watched this movie together with Citizen Kane and Akira and it easily "overpowered" both of these films (in terms of engaging my emotions). It's much more humane and engaging than 99.9% of all other films, animated or otherwise. The film also flows seamlessly and makes you pay attention without any effort, something that most movies have difficulty in attaining (a particularly extreme example would be Citizen Kane).This movie is considered to be Miyzaki's most personal film, as it reflects his childhood in Japan of the 1950&#x2032;s. Though I don't really care that much about how personal a film is to a director besides it's effect on the emotions produced by the film. Other Miyazaki films also had a very strong emotional effect without any personal connection with the director, for instance, Kiki's Delivery Service takes place in an alternate history European city and it is about equal to Totoro in my book.I have argued previously that Miyazaki films (as other Studio Ghibli films) are extremely aggressive. Indeed, this film is like being hit in the head repeatedly by a 10-ton stone made of pure cuteness over a period of 90 minutes: every minute of the film consists of scenes evoking these strong emotions, structured around a simple basic story to minimize noise and we can really fell like the protagonists during the course of the film, it reveals the inner child of anyone. A masterpiece of simplicity and yes, cinematic aggressiveness.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For somethings in the world you have to free minded,you can't go on reasoning everything you see and everything you watch. People say a person dies two times in his life, once when he is really dead and once when he steps out of his childhood. So if you are given a chance to live up your childhood for some 90 minutes, this movie is for you. Mystical creatures, nature, joy and sadness conquered by happiness are the some childhood reasoning. You wont go on reason everything you see and you have a belief in everything even Santa Claus when you are a kid so why don't relive those great feelings. Speaking for the movie the movie is made with a big heart. The picturesque scenery, the great artwork, the epic storyline, even the soundtrack especially THE PATH OF WIND one of my fav's instrumental. Hayao Miyazaki has created a life out of the movie. Besides it will indulge you in your childhood nostalgia, it will also show how beautiful nature and the villages can be which are reducing at a great rate. Many say this is a movie for kids, some say it's so naive. It is if you watch this movie with your mind full of reasoning. Sometimes do follow your heart and then watch this movie and feel the workmanship the makers have put into it. Concluding movies like this are not made often. A movie for all age groups and for EVERYONE.Finally, PUT YOUR REASONING ASIDE WHILE WATCHING THIS MOVIE.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Love and innocence at its best.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Each film from studio Ghibli has something which cannot be seen normally in other animation films. It's like they treat you in such a gentle way that you cannot hate their films. This film is again a best example of love and innocence at its best. What we have been provided with again is another visual treat of imaginations.The film has two major characters in the form of cute little girls who are enjoying their days as much as they can. They move to a so called haunted house and their adventures take new turns when they meet little creatures. The little girl is so adorable that you simply cannot take your eyes off her.Pros: When you will finish watching the film you will kind of feel happy cause like many other ghibli films this one also has positive attitude as the nature of people projected is a gentle and kind. The film progresses slowly and manages to keep you interested because of the adorable faces of the two major characters. After the halftime the story takes huge leaps of imaginations and you are now completely into the film. Sometimes you want to laugh, cry, get mad and all those emotions are aroused in this show of the film. Cons: Nothing as such but sometimes I feel that by showing us cute little faces and their innocence, aren't they enjoying the benefit of kindness?MESSAGE: "Never forget the simple pleasures of life."VERDICT: "Highly recommended for all animation lovers."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Sweet and Charming Timeless Classic!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As we all know, Hayao Miyazaki is a master story-teller and animation director. This movie is one of his earlier gems, released back in 1988.With a warm &amp; friendly story, and interesting characters &amp; situations, the visually arresting movie takes us on a joy ride. No Villains, No Songs, No Adult humour - Just a simple adventurous journey of two sisters. The human characters are so real, lively and sincere. Their interaction with the warm and likable fantasy characters is enjoyable. A person of any age and taste can enjoy the movie. It delights you, without being crude or vulgar.Trivia: The movie is slightly autobiographical. When Miyazaki and his brothers were children, his mother suffered from spinal tuberculosis for nine years, and spent much of her time hospitalized. It is implied, yet never revealed in the film, that Satsuki and Mei's mother also suffers from tuberculosis. He once said the film would have been too painful for him to make if the two protagonists were boys instead of girls.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The work of a great mind</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hayao Miyazaki may be better known for his western market breakthrough film, Spirited Away (which undoubtedly is one of the greatest ever animated movies) but for me, 'My Neighbour Totoro' is also up there with the best of them too.I won't go into too much detail about the film itself, suffice to say that it is a charming little movie whose characters will endear themselves to anyone with even the slightest sprinkling of good spirit in their soul.I first watched it at the age of twelve on returning home from a day at school. Despite missing the first fifteen minutes, I could instantly tell that I was going to be glued to my television screen for the duration! It was also my first experience of a Miyazaki film and introduced me in fine style to this master film maker.Roll forward 20 years, and here I am still captivated by this wonderful movie. The film's core message of being a free spirit and embracing the opportunity for adventure really is something that all children(and adults too) need to be taught in a society where from an early age we are conditioned to be mistrustful of others and overly cautious of our surroundings.What the big western animation studios like Disney and Pixar fail to grasp is that life isn't always about good vs evil or right vs wrong. Studio Ghibli is about the depth of their characters and the wonder of the locations.Finally, what this film really reflects well is that life is often just a series of random occurrences that should be savoured before they are over.If you understand that then this film will resonate with you and you should go and watch it. Now!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Totoro Enjoys life's smallest little moments that we adults, alas, don't do so anymore. This makes Totoro one of the greatest cinematic achievements ever...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If it wasn't for John Lasseter's (creator of Toy Story) love for Japanese anime, we would probably be in the dark still without the knowledge of the existence of Studio Ghibli, the next best animation studio after Disney Pixar. He helped in introducing to the world Ghibli's fantastic films. Hayao Miyazaki, Director and Screenwriter, contributed more handsomely to the studio's achievement and success. And My Neighbor Totoro is one of his greatest achievements, probably in the entire cinematic world. This was the first time I saw what they call "True Art" in any animated movie. The story is of two sisters, Mei and Satsuki, who with their father move to a new home. The two of them then happen to meet Totoro, a forest spirit who helps grow plants in the nearby forest. What unfolds next is a gentle heartwarming film experience that surprisingly leaves us nostalgic. Although the film seems to concentrate on a very young audience, it was an experience like Toy Story. What I love about this film is the way it takes time and allows us to get lost in Totoro's world. One scene I recall the most is the scene when the two girls and Totoro are waiting, just waiting, at a bus stop taking shelter in umbrellas from the rain. Miyazaki captured the calmness so perfectly that it made me think,"You don't get to see this even on Winnie the Pooh". That scene truly is one the greatest moments in all of cinema and is one of the reasons why I love his films so much. In this way, Miyazaki is extremely skilled at creating a lovely environment in his films, in this case the environment is more nature oriented. Joe Hisaishi's score too is great as always, he has scored almost all Miyazaki films.Miyazaki is well-known for his signature style of feminism, environmentalism and aviation. He uses all of these in Totoro. After Mickey Mouse, Teddy Bear and Winnie the Pooh, you will always find Totoro as the most favorite children's character. The innocence of Totoro is delightful for kids but more surprising thing is that the adults found it more moving and more meaningful and as I said earlier, Nostalgic...Totoro, when released in 1988, created a sensation in the animation world and Studio Ghibli gained recognition. It was only after Totoro that Miyazaki was going to receive the title of one of the greatest film-makers of our time that to this date has remained consistent.

		<shortDescription>Terrific movie, repressive DVD.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It always amazes me that Film Production Companies think that most people are, essentially, stupid. Miyazaki Hayao is easily one of the greatest filmmakers in the world, his animation routinely surpasses that of nearly all American releases and more than hold their own against even classics of American, and world, animation. His films are the most popular in Japan and should be here. Yet almost none of his films have been released on DVD in the States, with the exception of Princess Mononoke (Mononoke Hime)(2000), and the ones available here are weak to say the least.I just received My Neighbor Totoro DVD, one of my all time favorite flicks, expecting to find at least a couple of nice extras. Want to know what the features are? Pan and Scan! That's right not only is that a feature, it's not an extra feature so the only way to see the Fox Home Entertainment/Troma release is with the ends cut off! A fairly humiliating way for the world's greatest living animator to be honored.Did I mention that there is only one audio track? The English dub, is pretty good, but I prefer to have the option of watching a film in its native language with subtitles. Oh and the third feature is a couple of trailers for some other lame Fox releases.All in all a pretty sad DVD release that's only saving grace is that it's pretty cheap. But to be honest I'd prefer good to cheap.For a "must own" film, and I do believe that, Fox Home Entertainment certainly makes buying their version less than appealing. Serious movie fans should buy a DVD player that plays copies from various regions. From the looks of it, every single other release (including the Chinese releases in Mandarin and Cantonese) looks to be an improvement.Fox, you suck.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Why. Oh, why must Disney be so... I don't know... predictable or formulaic. This is why I love this children's anime film so much!"My Neighbor Totoro" is about two girls whom move out to the country in Japan. Soon they meet a forest sprit named Totoro. Now Totoro is responsible for the growth of the trees, the flow of the wind, and the nature's actions in general. He looks like a huge cute creature across from a cat, a bear, and most of all-an owl. Every once in a while he is accompanied by smaller versions of himself and a twelve-legged cat that acts as a bus. Together they go on small adventures flying through the woods and making plants grow. However, this is only is a backdrop to the movie as Totoro does not hog the plot.Truthful, this film is looked in the girls' perspective as they experience their joyful youth and fears like dealing with their mother's absence-whom is ill and at hospital. It makes me wonder if the adventures with Totoro are partly imaginary. Mmm... does it matter? No. This is just a perfect flick that proves that children films can be intelligent while being fully entertaining."Totoro" is drawn beautifully with vivid colours and photo-realistic scenes. This film is a directed by Hayao Miyazaki who is huge in Japan. Disney has recently picked up some his movies to be distributed here in the States like "Kiki Delivery Service" and "Princess Mononoke" (this is not one of them; this is from Fox-Video). Therefore, Disney might be on the way of doing more profound films and stripping away the tired formula. Amen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not the world's biggest animation fan, but I always make a point of watching Studio Ghibli movies whenever they're on; something about the creativity of such films appeals and reawakens the child in me. MY NEIGHBOR TOTORO is my latest watch from the studio, and while it's not my favourite, it does have plenty to recommend it.First off, this is a kid's film through and through, like the later PONYO (one of my all-time favourites). Don't go in expecting another GRAVE OF THE FIREFLIES, because this is all about magical childhood experiences and a break from the real world, a bit like THE SNOWMAN. Adult themes do intrude on the plot - the mother's illness, for instance - but for the most part this is a simple, straightforward children's adventure film.However, the film works due to the level of creativity present in the story, and particularly in the two creations thought up for the movie: there's the troll-like Totoro of the title, an intriguing and odd creature, and then there's the crowd-pleasing and lovable Catbus, the highlight of the whole thing.There's not a great deal of plot or incident, but there's some fine scenes involving kids lost in the forest or flying through the air, and some nicely-judged character work, particularly in the form of the ultra-shy neighbour's child. MY NEIGHBOUR TOTORO might not be the best that Ghibli has to offer, but it's no disappointment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This superbly animated children's tale is directed by Hayao Miyazaki, one of Japan's most beloved animators.This animated fantasy film written and directed by Miyazaki and produced by Studio Ghibli follows the two young daughters of a professor and their interactions with friendly wood spirits in postwar rural Japan.The story follows Satsuke and Mei, two young girls who find that their new country home is in a mystical forest inhabited by a menagerie of mystical creatures called Totoros. They befriend O Totoro, the biggest and eldest Totoro, who is also the king of the forest. As their girls' mother lies sick in the hospital, O Totoro brings the sisters on a magical adventure but also helps them to understand the realities of life. Like most films released by Miyazaki's Studio Ghibli, this family- oriented feature has a powerful ecological theme. The English-language version of this film wasn't dubbed until many years later, explaining the presence of actors such as Dakota Fanning in the cast.This is one of the best animated films ever made for families: it celebrates feminine sensitivity, the importance of the spirit world, respect for nature, and the pre-eminence of the spiritual practice of kindness. Overall,Miyazaki's cinematic magic is so enchanting that even a slew of unremarkable extra features won't take the smile off your face and it is a heartwarming, sentimental masterpiece that captures the simple grace of childhood.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Early work of a later master.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You won't see the brilliance of some of the later Miyazaki films ("Spirited Away", "Kiki Delivery Service", "Howl's Moving Castle", etc.) in this early (1988) Studio Ghibli production. Some of the trademark Miyazaki visually arresting elements are there - particularly the fantastic catbus. His mastery of artistic representations of natural elements (rainstorms, waves, etc.) which made "Spirited Away" and "Ponyo" such true works of art are here only in a pale reflection. "Tonari No Totoro" also does not delve into epic storytelling of war and environmental collapse as the later works do but does tell an mildly uplifting child's story of coping with sickness and displacement using the power of imagination. In short, if you are already a fan of Miyazaki, you should see the film to round out your experience. If not eschew this one in favor of his later more mature work.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very cute and colourful but the material is surprisingly childish and not as impacting as I had wanted it to be</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With their mother ill in hospital, Satsuki and Mei's father moves them to a new country house. The two girls are excited to find that their house is "haunted" and has soot gremlins running wild. Bundles of energy themselves, Satsukie and Mei love the space and the large forest all around them. While her father works and the older Satsuki goes to school, young Mei finds herself in the care of her neighbour "Granny". However going wandering alone in the grass, Mei finds another neighbour walking by ? a small little spirit creature that live in the woods, just one of three "Totoro's" that she befriends.Having seen screenshots of this film and seeing how cool the Totoro's were I was looking forward to this film. I'd love to be a film snob and pretend that I have known Miyazaki for years, the truth is I have not and know him thanks to the success of Spirited Away. I mention this because I was hoping for the emotional depth in this film that I had with SA and this was another reason I was looking forward to the film. Sadly it was not to be all I had hoped it would have been and, although his films are generally "critic-proof", it was hard not to be a bit disappointed with it. Part of the reason was that it was a lot more childish than I expected it to be and it took a long time to really get going and, once it did, it was over. Although the Totoro's are the selling point, the film is really about the humans and how the girls deal with their reality. Perhaps it was the Disney version I saw, but I felt this was badly done and the emotions weren't well developed ? rather they came out only in certain scenes and seemed artificial and were unengaging as a result.Visually the film is professional and polished in the "human" scenes but Miyazaki's imagination and style comes out with the Totoro's (which are very cool) and the cat bus (which is weirdly cool). As characters they are both very much side issues though. This is a bit annoying because of how cool they are, but it is actually distracting because of how underdeveloped the main material is. For children I imagine it will be great fun as they will love the girls and the creatures and won't find the story too simplistic. Adults will also love the charm of the creatures but many will struggle with the story that seems to be focusing on the emotions of the family but somehow fails to do it that well. Adults might also find the girls tiring as they are unbelievably cute balls of energy; personally I thought they were fun but I think they would wear me out totally if they were mine! In the Disney version the Fanning sisters do a pretty good job with the voice work. I cannot be sure if the failure of the material is Disney's fault or not but the Fannings do what they can. They are polished and cute but they cannot get consistent emotion in their characters and, when they do, it seems artificially condensed as if the writer had suddenly remembered that his characters had these worries and fears in their little hearts. The Totoros are very cute and quite funny but they are not emotional characters and I was a bit frustrated by them not contributing more to the experience than just being cool.Overall this is cute, cool and quite fun but those looking for it to even get close to the emotion and depth of Spirited Away will be disappointed. It seems to forget the heart of the story and is all too keen to just frolic with the Totoro before rushing the emotion in an unsatisfying conclusion. Fun, colourful and good for children but, aside from some moments of magic and cool creatures, many adults won't find the material to be strong enough to fully engage with.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very over rated film in my opinion</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I apologise to the seemingly massive fanbase for these Miyazaki films but I find them totally over praised.I cannot see what people find so amazing about them. The scripts are totally banal and unnatural with nothing that makes me feel any emotion or humour. I find the dialogue boring and idiotic to be honest.Yes the animation is what must attract people mainly I guess but is it just me or is it no better than the weird cartoons I used to watch on kids TV in the 80s like Ulysees, City of Gold or Thundercats? I just would accept it as a kid in the 80s and it is not terrible but while quirky it is neither clever nor realistic nor beautiful. I am not impressed.The stories are mostly weird. In this case again the film is weird and unengaging for me. I cannot see why people rate it so highly. The characters are uninteresting and the script is robotic. The quirky animation and story is all that I can see to attract people but I find it a big turn off. I feel it appeals to the kind of computer game playing, does not leave their bedroom type of geek who has not grown up. It is neither for children nor for adults which is my main disconnect I think. Just my opinion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A nice film for a quiet evening</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Firstly i have to say that i enjoyed this film. It was really beautiful to watch, especially with the rolling Japanese countryside, (as with all Miyakazi films) and was suitably short. Many of the scenes were innovative and i particularly enjoyed the cat bus scenes. However, as much as i liked the film, there were some major flaws, the main reason i only gave this film 7 out of 10. The first Miyakazi film i watched was Howl's Moving Castle, an epic film which i thoroughly enjoyed and watched multiple times. Howls Castle had a good script and good English voice-overs, but most importantly it had a credible plot and at the end of the film, i was left feeling i had achieved something by watching it. Unfortunately, this film didn't really go anywhere, and despite the fact i enjoyed it, i wasn't very pleased with it. The characters began to grate, especially the little child (Mia?), and the script was very weak. It may be that the English translation was very poor, and in that case, it was acceptable, but i was unimpressed with it at the end of the day. On the other hand, the shortness of the film saved it, and i would definitely recommend this as a good children's film, though I'm not sure it would appeal to a lot of adults, (i am typing here aware that a good deal of adults have commented and really enjoyed this film, but this is purely my humble opinion). I think 7 is a perfectly decent score for a perfectly decent film, but i think it is somewhat lacking in some departments, and that is a little bit disappointing.</fullReview>

Also that scene where the father and the girls are in the bath. Whats more disturbing is that the little girl looked as if she sat on his genitals. I swear like you call this a child's film???? OK so I know it said that in the east that the bathroom can be shared with the family but at the same time, you think to yourself, is he a good father after all? Like you would hope he doesn't turn out to be a pedophile because those girls are quite young! Honest to god, I think this film is very bad on the eyes especially mine, I wouldn't show this to kids, god no!</fullReview>

The daughters find that the house is inhabited by tiny animated dust creatures called soot sprites?small house spirits seen when moving from light to dark places. When the girls become comfortable in their new house and laugh with their father, the soot spirits leave.While she is playing outside one day, the younger daughter, Mei, sees two white, rabbit-like ears in the grass. She follows the ears under the house where she discovers two small magical creatures, who lead her through a briar patch, and into the hollow of a large Camphor Laurel tree. She meets and befriends a larger version of the same kind of spirit, which identifies itself by a series of roars she interprets as "Totoro" (in the Japanese original dub it stems from Mei's mispronunciation of the word for "troll", tororu). Her father later tells her that this is the "keeper of the forest". My Neighbour Totoro 5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is my fourth film from this celebrated animation artist; while I've always enjoyed his work, I still feel that it's somewhat overrated. The ones I'd watched - PRINCESS MONONOKE (1997), SPIRITED AWAY (2001; his best, in my opinion) and HOWL'S MOVING CASTLE (2004) - were all plot-packed, overwhelming visual experiences, so I was surprised to find this one much simpler, virtually kiddie-oriented and essentially plot less! It was still meticulously detailed and inventive, with two extremely likable female protagonists and equally delightful anthropomorphic characters - not to mention an infectious title track. I've yet to catch up with quite a number of his films (TCM showed a retrospective of his work while I was in Hollywood late last year, but I didn't have the time - or stamina - for them) but, given their basic similarity, I guess it's best to approach them one at a time (my local DVD rental outlet does carry a few more titles, though)...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why would Disney change the voice acting?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I agree entirely with little-bird-2. When I was growing up, I would borrow this movie from my local library. I loved it so much. Years passed, and I ended up in a relationship with a person who actually had it on VHS! I was so excited about it, I told her we HAD to watch it that night. Well, fast forward another couple of years... I bought the special edition DVD, and I couldn't wait to watch it. Pop it in, and the first thing I noticed was the opening credits had a different singer. I was a little mad about that, but it was OK. But then the dialog started. I wasted $22.00. Everything was just too strange. The original voices were perfectly fine. If they ABSOLUTELY HAD TO change it, why couldn't they just keep the same dialog at the VERY least?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Saw this is high school Japanese class in '95</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this as I was just getting into anime, so I must say that I was disappointed. Yeah, I know it's kiddie fare for the most part, that doesn't let it off the hook. When I filtered the top 250 into animations and saw that "My Neighbor Totoro" was #2, I was shocked and appalled. This is fine as a kiddie flick, but has really NO value outside of that boundary. Another reviewer has called it "imaginative", and perhaps it is that. But that's hardly enough to warrant watching this film unless you're 4 years old. We watched it in class because at the time we didn't even know any Japanese words other than "shinkansen". The members of my class immediately skipped ahead in our writing texts to learn how to write "Totoro" in hiragana script and made a joke out of it for 3 months, writing it on the boards. I think "Totoro wa, nan des ka" was our classes anthem. Please don't watch this film. Kiddie flicks have no business being rated so highly on this site,</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rather disappointing.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie, although it had some fairly cute moments, had an extremely weak plot. There are no dramatic events within it, and thus, no room or place for the characters to grow. In fact, the movie doesn't even attempt to include those subtle moral themes that are so typical of most children's films- which, contrary to some beliefs can be a very good and important thing when done well.Instead of being the mysterious and wonderful film it was supposed to be, it seemed rather...bland. Adventures with Totoro seemed very aimless and could've been done a lot more colorfully.Also, what was up with that gigantic smile (and equally colossal roar) that Totoro had? Instead of being friendly, it appeared rather ominous. In fact it reminded my older siblings and I of the grin of Ghostly from Pokemon.I'm fairly sure, though, that somebody, somewhere, will be enchanted by this movie despite what I say. Seeing how my 4 year-old sister was enraptured by the film- and seemingly not at all disturbed by Totoro or his cat-shaped bus- I perhaps have the bias that comes with being skeptical and teen aged. I would, however, highly recommend those enchanted-creature-hungry-folk to leave this one and pursue one of Miyazaki's other films, or, Alice and Wonderland.So, after taking all factors into account, I've decided to be generous and give this movie a 7, whereas personally, it was more like a 6 for me.</fullReview>

At least thats how it is in the English version. I really liked it though. I think little kids would get a kick out of it. All of thew Backgrounds were gorgeous, and it was certainly a unique plot, even if that totoro thing screamed a lot seemingly without reason. I also saw Spirited Away, which I think is less child-friendly. I don't have any kids though, so I don't mind too much. I think that its interesting that the guy made the movie modeled it after his own childhood. Even if his mom was sick, he's making some cash off of it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disney's change of voice actors</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>How in the world could Disney have the presumption to change the voice actors for the release of the DVD? "Totoro" was created in 1988 and Disney's original version came out in 1994. Clearly, the love of "Totoro" and its fame since its premiere was not due to some top name voice actor. Most people didn't even recognize that it was Tim Daly's voice as the Dad."Totoro" was the one of the very few Japanese anime that I enjoy (and most others enjoy) the dubbed version as well as the Japanese version. Did any of the public complain that there was not a high-billed voice actor in its cast? Clearly, no.Then, why in the world would Disney decided to change the actors and cast DAKOTA FANNING and her sister, ELLE FANNING, as Mei and Setsume?????AND, what about the original voice actors? Don't they have a say in this matter? Is anyone fighting on their behalf?If I had known Disney did this, I would have never bought the DVD and now that's already open, there's no way I can take it back. Thank God, I never threw away my original VHS version.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bland, boring, predictable animated pseudo fairytale of two Japanese girls and their father who move to the country to be nearer to their ailing mother's hospital.One day, they meet a forest spirit whom they call Totoro.Looking like an overweight rabbit with short prick erect ears, this non-threatening harmless character leads them through a series of bland, Disney like adventures that makes even "Dora the Explorer" look like Shakespeare's " Mac Beth"-and we don't even get to see Totoro until a half hour into the movie! Thats about it. This is probably the most over rated film from Miyazaki, the uber over rated Japanese anime director.Its all done in a pastel tone animated style that looks like an a painting by a first grader, yet some of the backgrounds do have a certain charm to them.There is no edge, conflict, sense of menace or real emotion or drama in this pablum coated film to engage the audience. Even a 3 year old would become bored-fast. Done by Studio Ghibli-a sort of Japanese Disney studio, this turkey has earned much yen since its release. Not to mention the merchandising it has inspired that, fortunately is not too readily available in the United States. And can anybody please tell me what is so great about Miyazaki? He's just another "in it for the money" artist like Tim Burton, Spielberg, and Murakami. As a matter of fact, I have a hard time distinguishing Miyazaki from Murakami.. Even Spielberg's "ET", a film that I thoroughly hated seems enjoyable and well made when compared to this. Do yourself a favor-watch it only if you have to. Not worth your precious time.For some reason, this was one of the the highest grossing film of all time in Japan until Titanic came along. I can't see why.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film has a magical element that is rarely found in films, it really is a heartwarming tale, unfortunately the film is rather short and has little character development.For example, Tatsuo, a character who secretly loves the main character, doesn't develop his feelings at all, he loves her at first site, he is too shy to talk to her, then he talks to her once or twice and thats it! The 2 girls mother is in hospital, but the audience is never told why.Totoro, the mystical creature, is cute and cuddly like a large teddy bear, and this will make the film very appealing to kids, but there isn't much to keep anyone else interested.One of the characters who babysits the kids likes to be called "Granny" by everyone, and one of the girls does not like to spend time alone with her, now this does seem perverted as if the character may be a paedophile, but nothing happens in the story to tell us this.I rate this film a 5/10, decent animation, decent plot for young children, however that is about it, but I strongly urge you to see the film at least once!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Irritatingly Sugary-Sweet</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's no doubt that Hayao Miyazaki is a genius, but even Spielberg has made some clunkers in his time. My Neighbor Totoro is a beautiful animated tale with plenty of interesting character animation and breathtaking backgrounds. However, it takes exactly 30 minutes before the a "totoro" (the titular fictional creature) actually appears and then another 30 minutes before it does anything worthwhile. In between nothing happening, the characters are irritating sugary-sweet. The dialogue is so unoffensive that I was offended. Miyazaki-san is known for being a nature lover and usually animates cautionary tales about disrespect for nature. Sometimes this message is subtle; the rest of the time he wallops the audience over the head with it. This film is not even suitable for children as it slugs along with no pulse. On those rare occasions when a Totoro does appear, the creature's on screen interaction with the children is quirky and creative. When the creature is not on screen the humans trade sugary-sweet pleasantries back and forth ad nauseam. The girls are hyperactive but never once disciplined by their kind, but dull father. The sisters never once bicker and I must question why Miyazaki must have their panties showing whenever they run fast. The human characters once sat around and yapped about sharing fresh vegetables with one another. Why waste dialogue on how good a cucumber tastes? Where's the plot? There's no conflict or even a lesson to be learned. If you can stomach the overly-sweet dialogue and lack of a conflict for a full hour, you just may survive the last half-hour when something finally does happen. The last half-hour does not redeem the movie, instead its what should have been the movie all along!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is supposedly one of the "Great Movies" according to Roger Ebert...My tone in the previous sentence should suffice for my review, but I feel like more needs to be said. My Neighbor Totoro isn't offensive, obnoxious, disturbing, annoying, or irritating in any way. And as Ebert continually points out in his review, it doesn't fall in line with a lot of clichés that are prevalent in American cartoons in terms of characterization or plot-line. This may all be true; but it doesn't make up for it's fatal flaw...it's boring. It's really really, boring. There is hardly any plot other then these 2 girls hanging around their house out in the country side. The title character makes his first appearance 30 minutes in, and only a couple of times after that. He doesn't do much either. In his debut scene he sleeps and yawns...how appropriate. Later he does some other stuff but it's not too exciting and perhaps only mildly so compared to the doldrum of the girls lives. I wasn't "enchanted", the world didn't seem that magical to me, and with the lack of any compelling plot I couldn't help but once again become baffled by the godly praise for this movie. The animation is OK but don't see why Miyazaki's work is considered to be THAT much better then everyone else's. Perhaps you have to be an anime aficionado to understand why. Perhaps you have to be an anime aficionado to love this movie. I can think of no other reason why. Granted, I'm 23 and cartoons don't hold the same appeal as they did 15 years ago. But that being said, I can't see myself even sitting through this 15 years ago. And as an adult, it doesn't seem to hold much value. There is no plot, the writing is forgettable, and I don't find it's artistic value to be any higher then that of any other anime. Bottom line, if you are an anime fan, you aren't even reading this because you own My Neighboro Totoro on DVD and are probably waiting for the special edition. However, if you are checking up on one of the "Great Movies" or if you a parent and want to show your kid something, I can't recommend it to you on either level.</fullReview>

They changed half of the lines and butcheredthe rest. There are also subtitles in it. Pointing out things that you may not understand. Like when they were unpacking a box, they had a little note that said "tea" at the bottom of the screen. WHO CARES WHAT IT IS?! I WANT TO WATCH THE MOVIE!!
