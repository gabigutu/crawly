		<shortDescription>GREAT MOVIE: MORE HISTORICALLY ACCURATE THAN SOME REALIZE...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a great movie which much more historically accurate than it is often given credit for. So many who say otherwise are ill-informed and obviously don't know much about the actual history of that actual escape. The depiction of what happened to the recaptured prisoners in the movie of THE GREAT ESCAPE is reasonably accurate as detailed on the historyinfilm site...specifically on the "Reprisal" page; along with being detailed in the various published accounts.Hitler ultimately calmed down after being reasoned with by Goering, Feldmarschall Keitel, Maj-Gen Graevenitz and Maj-Gen Westhoff, and dictated that more than half the prisoners be shot and cremated. So, as depicted in the film, several of those recaptured were not executed and were indeed returned to confinement. In fact, even those executed were not "shot on the spot" for the most part, but were actually executed later after being turned over to the Gestapo; most being shot while being allowed to relieve themselves, under the guise of "trying to escape".Furthermore, there are many accounts as to how much more humane the environment was within the camp (which even had a popular and very successful theatre, featuring prisoners who would later be name performers) than many other POW camps...and certainly nothing like the harsh conditions associated with the Concentration or Extermination camps.To quote one source:"It must be made clear that the German Luftwaffe [the German Air Force], who were responsible for Air Force prisoners of war, maintained a degree of professional respect for fellow flyers, and the general attitude of the camp security officers and guards should not be confused with the SS or Gestapo. The Luftwaffe treated the POWs well, despite an erratic and inconsistent supply of food.Prisoners were handled quite fairly within the Geneva Convention, and the Kommandant, Oberst (Colonel) Friedrich-Wilhelm von Lindeiner-Wildau, was a professional and honourable soldier who won the respect of the senior prisoners."Finally, virtually all the major engineering aspects in regards to the tunnels and the initial escape in the film are as they were actually acheived in the real escape.It would behoove some to learn a little more actual history or do a little simple research before shooting from the hip with supposed "knowledge" of reality. THE GREAT ESCAPE certainly takes liberties in tone and character portrayal, but not in the key elements that are disparaged out of sneering ignorance.BRIDGE ON THE RIVER KWAI is also a great film, but took even greater liberties with the technical details of the events described than THE GREAT ESCAPE did....and offering up VON RYAN'S EXPRESS as a more realistic alternative is simply delusional and ridiculous.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Escape,Great movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This must be my favorite movie of all times. Having seen it for the first time,in I guess 1987,a BBC Christmas broadcast,I was captivated by this brilliant piece of work. In the years after,I probably have seen it a "million" times,owning it on VHS and DVD,and still watching,whenever it is broadcast,in the original language. Why is it so great? This is a movie that keeps you locked to the screen,because it has everything a great movie should have. A great story,a good length,tension,it is a WW2 movie and the actors give top performances.Not just Steve McQueen,although his performance is brilliant,but also James Garner,James Coburn,Richard Attenborough,Charles Bronson and in this film,one of the greatest roles Donald Pleasance,playing the forger. It isn't historically accurate,please read the book by Paul Brickhill,but that doesn't matter a bit. This film gives you an image of POW camp,the prisoners and their guards,the Germans are also played brilliantly by German actors. I will not repeat the story here,but I can tell you,this film will capture you,all the characters are portrayed brilliantly by the actors. There is excitement,humor,tension,drama and emotion. See it,you will not regret it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If you're going to critique the history, then know the history.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I find it difficult to believe that some reviewers' negative reactions to this film are based on their (misguided) beliefs that none of this could possibly have happened. Comments like these make it crystal clear that what some people don't know about history is appalling. If you are going to judge a film based on historical fact, it helps if you know what it is.It is well-documented what amazing technical feats the POW's were able to accomplish in the stalags. There was even an entire section of the British Secret Service dedicated to coming up with all sorts of clever ways to send these captured men the tools they needed to facilitate their escape attempts, i.e., sandwiching maps between the split sides of a record album (yes, the Germans allowed the prisoners to have records in the camps) or compasses in pens. At Colditz Castle, one of the more forbidding stalags, (actually an offlag since is was for officers only), many, many tunnels were dug and disguises created. One man actually created a German sergeant's uniform totally from scratch, donned a moustache and created an overall impersonation so realistic, it fooled two out of three sets of sentries. Some of the POW's built and concealed an entire glider that would have carried two men off the roof and over the wall! The only reason it didn't fly was because the prison was liberated before they got the chance! The Colditz experience is well documented. There are many books written about that particular prison complete with photographs, including one by a German officer confirming these amazing escapes and attempts. The reviewers who doubt what can be done when necessity is truly the mother of invention should look for them and learn something. As for the prisoners not being in jumpsuits, as suggested by one reviewer as one reason to question the authenticity of the film? Ludicrous, POW's wore what they were captured in. The German military (different from the Gestapo and the SS) considered them soldiers and allowed them to keep their badges of rank.As for the film itself, it is long, but absorbing. There are historical flaws (as there are in all movies), but several of the former POW's participated in the filming process, keeping it, for the most part, very authentic. As for the emphasis on Americans, it's true they were not among the escapees per se, but several did assist in the effort before they were transferred out, as mentioned by a previous reviewer. However, you must remember that the movie was made for an American audience in 1963, long before international distribution revenue became so important to a studio's bottom line. They needed American stars who would appeal to an American audience. Who knows, perhaps if they were to remake it today, the cast would be all British and German, but I doubt it (see "Hart's War" where not only the plot, but all the British and Canadian characters that were in the book, disappeared).All in all, "The Great Escape" is an entertaining movie telling a fascinating story of what ordinary men can achieve in adverse circumstances. It's well worth the time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A genuine timeless classic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>During World War Two the Germans build a new prison camp, Stalag Luft III, for the express purpose of housing many of their most troublesome captured Allied airmen. However, all this serves to do is to pool the resources of some of the most ingenious escape artists in captivity and fill them with a resolve to engineer a mass breakout from the camp. Based largely on real events, this film has assumed classic status over the years and its easy to understand why. Quite simply, it excells in many departments. Director John Sturges was at the height of his creative powers and he keeps a firm grip on the proceedings. Although the film runs close to three hours it never feels sluggish, while at the same time winding up the tension gradually and developing the characters. The production design is first rate, to the point where Donald Pleasance (who had been a P.O.W.) felt quite intimidated by the vast set on his arrival. Daniel Fapp's beautiful photography shows this and the picturesque German locations off to full effect. Put these virtues together with a good script, inspired casting and a classic score by Elmer Bernstein, and you have an object lesson in how to create an intelligent and exciting big budget adventure film. On the subject of the cast; Much is made of Steve McQueen's role. While I am a huge McQueen fan, I feel that some of the other performances are equal to, if not better than his. Richard Attenborough, James Garner, Donald Pleasance, Charles Bronson and Gordon Jackson are all excellent. Good too are James Coburn, James Donald, David McCallum and Hannes Messemer as the sympathetic Commandant. This is one of those films that I can happily watch time and time again. In September of this year a new print was screened at the NFT in London as part of an 'Attenborough at 80' season. It was a pleasure to see this on the big screen at last. For the most part the print was in very good condition. The DVD was one of the first that I ever bought some three and a half years ago, and I watched its inevitable Christmas screening on BBC2 last night. I just never tire of it. In these days of brainless, poorly executed action fodder, its a joy to behold something that hits its targets so precisely. </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Absolutely Awesome!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Great Escape is a classic war movie with plenty happening in it. It just so happens that it is my all time favourite having seen it 60 times since it first was released. Steve McQueen , as Hilts, was the driving force behind this movie. He seemed to tie everything together between the American and British prisoners especially in the scene where they were celebrating the 4th of July with the drums and good ole fashioned American moonshine. The Great Escape contains one of the most famous movie scenes of all times when McQueen has half of the German army chasing after him while riding his motorcycle trying to jump the barb wire fence to get to Switzerland. All in all, The Great Escape had a cast of actors that was so strong that it was a wonder they got this movie made in the first place with all of the egos involved. James Garner, Charles Bronson, Angus Lennie, James Coburn, etc.were absolutely awesome.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"We Intend To Watch This Basket Very Closely."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Great Escape tells the amazing story of a whole bunch of allied prisoners who accomplish a mass breakout during World War II, some of whom actually did make it to freedom and the allied armed forces once again. The film is so good that you do not mind the fact that some American players were tossed into the story as the real story was one accomplished by the British.To insure that the American movie public would be buying tickets, several American players got into The Great Escape. Charles Bronson, James Coburn, and a pair of American TV cowboys just breaking into big screen star status, James Garner and Steve McQueen were put in the film. Director John Sturges had worked with McQueen, Coburn, and Bronson in his last film The Magnificent Seven. Sturges does a grand job in never letting his audiences attention flag for one minute in this almost three hour length film.What the Nazis have done in this film is to build a brand new prison camp and have put all the perennial escape artists in this one. Of course by doing so a whole lot of talented escape artists in one place.And the organized effort is led by Richard Attenborough. Without going overboard into a whole lot of flag waving, Sturges and Attenborough give us the portrayal of a deeply patriotic man who if he can't back into the fight himself, is going to do what he can from a POW camp to bedevil the people making war on his country. He leads the mass escape attempt with an almost corporate efficiency.The opposite of course is Steve McQueen. I've always thought of Captain Virgil Hills as the ultimate Steve McQueen role of individualism. He and flight officer Angus Lennie are going to get out, no matter what, on their own or with the group. Angus Lennie is the former jockey now RAF flight officer and his death amidst a Fourth of July party that McQueen, Garner, and Jud Taylor have is one of the most moving scenes ever put on film. McQueen decides to play for the team after that.The Great Escape allowed McQueen to indulge in one of his hobbies of motorcycling. His race through the German country side on a stolen Nazi uniform and motorcycle is a spectacular one, aided and abetted by Elmer Bernstein's magnificent film score.James Garner bonds with Donald Pleasance in the film. Garner is an American in the RAF Eagle Squadron, Americans who couldn't wait for their own country to get into the war who enlisted in the RAF. A lot of Garner's TV character of Bret Maverick is in his role as Hendley the scrounger/con artist. Pleasance is his room mate, the shy bird watcher who does the work of forging documents for the escaping prisoners. He's going blind as it turns out, my guess would be from untreated glaucoma. It's nice to see Donald Pleasance for once as a nice guy on the screen. His death due in part to his incipient blindness is also a moving one.Charles Bronson is also another foreign volunteer for the RAF, from Poland as befitting Bronson who is of Polish origin. He's the tunnel digger who suffers from claustrophobia and his scenes are primarily with British teen idol John Leyton. This was another of a long series of great character roles for Bronson on his way to stardom.James Coburn shows that like Robert Mitchum, he too had a good ear for accents. His Aussie speech pattern is as good as Mitchum's was in The Sundowners.The Germans here are also portrayed three dimensionally. Robert Graf is the not too bright corporal who isn't exactly happy to be at war, but is grateful he ain't serving in Russia. He gets unmercifully conned by Garner. Hannes Messemer is the commandant of the POW camp, an officer in the Luftwaffe. The prisoners are nearly all RAF officers and enlisted men and the Luftwaffe is in charge of the camp. Messemer is as fearful of the S.S. and the Gestapo as his prisoners are. He's also as very conscious of the atrocities those worthy organizations are capable of and my favorite scene in the film is him having to tell of one to the Senior British officer in the camp, James Donald. Messemer is conscious also of his failure to watch the basket of rotten eggs put in his charge very closely.The Great Escape does the one essential thing for a movie to do, it moves. Even in just the scenes of planning and preparation you are aware of movement. I mentioned Elmer Bernstein's film score. It's one of Bernstein's best, maybe one of the best known of any film in cinema history. The Great Escape is one of those films you can watch dozens of times and never tire of. It's a wonderful film, a real tribute to the best in mankind under some of the worst circumstances.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A vast, multi-star war epic with great score by Elmer Bernstein...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'The Great Escape' had the advantage of a fine source, and a fine script... Each actor realizes his potential in a very detailed manner, giving a feeling lost in the actual cinema...Sturges is careful with the pace in the first half, allowing the escape plans develop slowly... Humor, excitement and human drama are wonderfully blended, and smartly underscored by Elmer Bernstein's memorable background music... The film opens with several truckloads of Allied officers, mostly pilots, being transferred to a new German maximum-security prison camp at Sagan... The Camp 'Kommandant', Von Luger (Hannes Messemer), tells Captain Ramsey (James Donald), 'We have, in effect, put all our rotten eggs in one basket, and we intend to watch this basket carefully.'But since all the British and American officers in his charge are men who have made several attempts to escape from other prison camps, Von Luger knows his words are meaningless... The master planner is 'Big X,' Roger Bartlett (Richard Attenborough), who has just endured three months of Gestapo/SS torture, and plans to strike back, getting as many men as possible out of the camp, in order to 'harass, confuse and confound the enemy' behind the lines...He announces a terrific plan for a mass break-out of 250 men and schemes three simultaneous tunnels Tom, Dick, and Harry... The plan, so precise, proceeds in an orderly fashion, with a great deal of attention placed on caution and ruse to deflect German attentions... The captives involve themselves in much surface activity, which masks the underground work... Hilts (Steve McQuenn), the 'Cooler King,' leads the Germans on a memorable motorcycle chase through back roads and across the fields right up to the Swiss frontier...Hendley (James Garner), the 'Scrounger' is a charming thief whose particular gift is the misappropriation of all the required supplies for an escape...Blythe (Donald Pleasance) has the talents of a 'Forger', and makes visas and passports... He suggests in one scene: ' Tea without milk is so uncivilized.'Danny Velinski (Charles Bronson) is the experienced Polish-American 'Tunnel-King.' Louis Sedgwick (James Coburn) is the 'Manufacturer' of bellows-operated ventilation...Ashley-Pitt (David McCallum) is the 'Dispersal' with his ingenious methods of getting rid of the dirt generated by the tunneling activities... Andy McDonald (Gordon Jackson ) is 'Intelligence,' the officer who develops a fantastic security system to protect the compounds from the German "Ferrets." Archibald Ives (Angus Lennie) is the 'Mole,' whose fragile mind has been taxed by several years in the camps, repeated failed escape attempts, and time in the cooler...Dennis Cavendish (Nigel Stock) is the 'Surveyor' who miscalculates the distance to the trees...Guard Werner (Robert Graf) is the 'Ferret' who affirms to Hendley: 'I could tell you stories about my teeth that would make your hair stand on end.' 'The Great Escape' is a pretty good motion picture where the toll of freedom is precious, and the movie's ending provokes deep and serious meditation... It graphically shows what enterprising men can accomplish under the most unusual circumstances... It has a great cast, and is beautifully made...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Steve McQueen plays Steve McQueen.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are only two things wrong with The Great Escape:(1) There was no sequel.(2) I have never figured out how to get my A-2 flight jacket to look as beat up as the one worn by Virgil Hilts.McQueen personifies the American Air Force officer in WW2. He is a strong individualist, put off by Mickey Mouse discipline but has put up with it in order to fly. Yet when faced with a political and moral challenge- escaping from a POW camp, or harassing the enemy, both to maintain his dignity and continue the fight, he shows an inner discipline and strong team player mentality.McQueen's own military experience shows though here and gives real depth and credibility to his character (despite his arrogance, Hilts addresses the German Commandant by ending each response with "Ya Voll, Herr Oberst" [Yes sir, My colonel]. As he passes the Senior British Officer [SBO] in the last scene, he nods and acknowledges his superior officer with a simple "...sir"). These are traits of an experienced soldier, not an actor reading lines. McQueen plays his role this way throughout the movie.Like every other McQueen fan, I keep watching the film again and again, because I know if I do he will eventually jump the motorcycle over the barbed wire fence and head off to freedom.(Note: The character Hilts was based upon was an OSS agent named Sage. Sage eventually did escape from another POW camp later in the war, so even though the bike jump wasn't successful, Hilts was. Somewhat of a consolation).A beautiful Elmer Bernstein sound track is hauntingly choreographed with stunning German Bavarian scenery. John Sturges has assembled his cast of "usual suspects": McQueen, Coburn &amp; Bronson from previous war and western flicks. Sir Richard Attenborough is superb as "Big X" the escape committee mastermind, and James Garner plays James Garner plays James Garner...as (Bret Maverick) the perennial wise cracking thief and scrounger.Even after nearly 40 years, I still love watching the intro credits roll and the music start...Once the POWs jump down from the trucks I'm absorbed into the plot all over again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Credit should be given to the brilliant score by Elmer Bernstein. If you listen to it closely, it literally is a battle between the Allied Prisoners (flutes &amp; woodwinds) and the Germans (tubas). The escape scenes with the little boat on the scenic german river is evocative of Wagner and his heroic Germanic Operas. The scenery of the German countryside and the Alps is breathtaking. I believe that the scriptwriters emphasized the heroism, humor, and character of the prisoners to make an uplifting statement of what is essentially a cruel and tragic story. As a child growing up in the seventies, our 7th grade glass was reading the Paul Brickhill book and we had the opportunity to meet a former (American) Stalag Luft III prisoner from that era. He had arrived at the camp after the Great Escape, but was placed on the monument detail for the 50 executed men. He said that few men seriously contemplated escape after this incident and the emphasis was on surviving the war and going home alive.</fullReview>

These men are all near saints; James Garner insisting on Donald Plesence making the escape, Charles Bronson fighting his claustrophobia. Steve McQueen is the star among the stars, not merely because of his motorcycle skills but for his attempt to save a life and for bringing the game of "off the wall" to the masses. :-)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Wait a minute, you aren't seriously suggesting that if I get thru the wire and case everything out there, and don't get picked up, to turn myself in and get thrown in the cooler for a couple of months so you can get the information you need"Smart, witty and directed with adroit hands by John Sturges, The Great Escape is standing the test of time as a joyous multi cast family favourite. Based on the real accounts of allied soldiers escaping en mass from a German POW camp back in 1942, the film is involving from start to finish, due in the main to the wonderful array of characters on show. We follow them from the moment they arrive at the camp right thru to the stunning climax, and it is with great joy I say that none of the cast lets the side down, they all do great work for the astute and undervalued Sturges. A number of great set pieces allied with Elmer Bernstein's fabulous score never lets the blood settle, and in amongst the cute slices of humour is palpable tension to make this simply one of the best films of it's type, in fact one of the best films ever.Sturges and his writers, James Clavell &amp; W.R. Burnett, adapt from the book written by Paul Brickhill, someone who speaks from experience having been one of the prisoners of super POW camp Stalag Luft III, which of course is what The Great Escape is born from. Sturges was fascinated by the story and after trying without fail for over a decade to get it onto the screen, he finally succeeded. The success three years earlier of his star ensemble Western, The Magnificent Seven, enabled Sturges to realise his vision, the result of which is still enthralling new generations with each passing year.The cast is made up of notable thespians and iconic heroes. Steve McQueen (enticing the American audience in one feels), Richard Attenborough, Charles Bronson, James Donald, Donald Pleasance, James Coburn, James Garner, David McCallum, John Leyton and Gordon Jackson. Which of course is a pretty tidy roll call, but it shouldn't be understated the input of Hannes Messemer as the Camp Commandant, Colonel Von Luger. His scenes have a humanistic quality that shows a softer side of Germany to the one ruled by a certain despot (the finale here offering up the counter opposite of the war), the writers smartly, and rightly, not tarring a nation with the same old brush.A wonderful involving movie that puts characteristic heart in bed with its action and suspense laden plot. 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>We Choose the Cooler</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers herein.Films are like people in the respect that some are leaders but most followers. That's because most movies are not about life, but about previous movies. This film established not only a genre (I chose to resee it after `Chicken Run') but played a role in inventing a society. I'm of the belief that culture invents some art that in turn reinvents the culture. More about that in a minute.What's so special about this is that it places the American rebel (with his motorcycle) in mainstream American society. Before, the beatnik or `bohemian' was unamerican, nonmainstream. This film invents memories of the war for the generation after the war -- it takes an essentially British story and uses it as background to establish a new vision of the American rebel. This rebel is centrally American, heroic even. Independent of sex.There are four forces in this film. The evil Gestapo (with the majority of Germans, but the film glosses that); the two forces of the British and German Air Force stuck in a duel of gallantry from a prior generation; and then the McQueen force. All at once, we have the cockiness and independence of Brando and Dean transformed into a patriotic center, into something directed, seemingly casually, against intrinsic evil.I saw an advance screening of this in most peculiar circumstances. I was a cadet in a midwestern military academy whose commandant was the senior American officer at the POW camp during the planning of the escape. (Americans were moved shortly before, and the reason is an interesting story in itself.) We 850 mostly sons of republicans mostly hawks, all white were given a vision of necessary disturbance, of a strange patriot that we couldn't internalize. Only a couple months later JFK was murdered. The Cooler King was one key image we used with our brethren nationwide to reinvent ourselves. Check it out. This contributed to a national identity that actually lived for a while. Never plan to win, just make your own statement.Attenborough knows something about manipulating the British image for American consumption. His `Ghandi' is a masterpiece of posture. Talent. Sturges' camera is quiet, still, non-modern, so that you lose awareness that this is a film. This stance is dated -- wouldn't work today, and makes things feel as of a different era. Attenborough's camera sweeps (see his short episode -- the Indian sequence -- in `Close Encounters.') Attenborough's acting style here (indeed his role too) mirrors that. It is a fulcrum of everything, a subliminal sweep under Sturges' stillness.Check out the score by Bernstein. If you take out just a little of the march tempo, you have Williams' copy for Indiana Jones. Indy echoed the tone for a by that time narcissistic notion of rebellion: mystical forces of evil accommodated by selfish acquisition and pathetic self-deprecation -- the Reagan American. Williams intended to quote Bernstein to make this point, I think.If you haven't seen it yet, look for the Cooler guard. His hesitation at the end is priceless, indicating that every soul is malleable. It is why the film wasn't made for eight years, bombed when it came out, but is now in the IMDB top 100.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>McQueen's breakout: Cooler King becomes King of Cool</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sometimes a big, cynical package entertainment off the generic production line transcends its origins and goes into orbit, as it were, growing ever larger in memory. "Casablanca" was the classic example; "The Poseidon Adventure" and "The Towering Inferno" are more recent ones. For Brits, "The Great Escape" has this status: even as I write, soccer fans at the World Cup are beating out Elmer Bernstein's brisk march theme while England labours to a draw.Not a great hit when released, "The Great Escape" clicked through repeated TV showings. It goes on clicking, like "Casablanca" or "Gone with the Wind"- because it embodies truth to the spirit of its own times as well as to what was 20 years in the past when it was filmed. As several reviewers have said, it doesn't wear out, and this is why.By 1963 audiences were becoming bored with endless relivings of heroic World War Two exploits: adolescent moviegoers were too young to remember it and were tired of seeing their dads' doings, which made their own lives feel smaller and duller. But "The Great Escape" depicted a failed breakout from an inglorious captivity; less sharp than Wilder's "Stalag 17", it nonetheless managed to combine the expected set pieces of tension and derring-do with an incipient Swinging Sixties individualism. These guys are collaborating to dig their way out, but then they're on their own for the home run. Few make it.Nobody incarnated the new spirit more than Hilts the Cooler King, played by Steve McQueen. The film made him a solo star name above the title: he stands out amid an ensemble as he didn't, quite, in Sturges's "Magnificent Seven". McQueen's persona was set by ex-POW James Clavell's dialogue. He's not the boring, by-the-numbers rebel designed by hacks to make an authority figure such as a cop more palatable to a rebellious teen audience. He's an instinctive, can't-help-it individualist.McQueen is not gratuitously insubordinate towards his own superiors in the camp. Neither does he set out to provoke the Germans, who aren't hateful. Hilts can't help wanting to be beyond the barbed wire, and that makes his brand of rebelliousness less neurotic, more sympathetic to adult viewers than a crybaby, James Deanish sort would be. McQueen, then and later (eg in "The Towering Inferno") has the authority of the man who does not define his values solely by reaction against the consensus. As such, in "The Great Escape" he personifies democracy pitted against dictatorship in total war. He's voluntarily under orders for the duration, but he fights to be free again, and for ever: free to leap the wire and leave all confinement behind, far and fast. Meantime, he's self-contained, happy to play baseball against a blank wall, in no danger of going mad for want of company like a dictator's slave.McQueen's American cool counterpoints the laid-back qualities of the British. Donald, Attenborough and Pleasence are all quietly magnetic, assured presences. No scenery chewers wanted- this is war, too serious for show-offs. Lennie, the man driven mad, disposes of himself.The Anglo-American collaboration in this production is among the smoothest ever. The British movie business was turning into Hollywood, England; here was a story where no fancy plot tricks were needed to bring Limeys and Yanks together, and the Yanks were the kind we admired most: those who hadn't waited till Pearl Harbor but hastened to the anti-Nazi colours as freelances. Another reason to admire McQueen's maverick stance, and James Garner's quirkier version of it. At the same time, the overall patina is recognisably British stiff-upper-lip, like "Albert RN" or "The Colditz Story". There is little psychologising and no silly love interest; these chaps have a task to perform and they get on with it. Sturges was an admirer of the British martial spirit like his fellow he-man, Hemingway. It shows.The script conflates incidents from several WW2 situations: a literal account of the March 1944 breakout at Sagan masterminded by Roger Bushell/Bartlett would have courted libel actions. Posters who criticise the portrayal of the camp have got it wrong. The men were in a Stalag, an officers' camp run by the Wehrmacht and Luftwaffe, not the SS. They were under the Geneva Convention, inspected by the Red Cross. Prisoners were treated with the courtesy due to involuntary guests, though on their honour not to attempt escape as their duty to their own countries required. Even at Colditz, the castle where incorrigible fugitives were immured, the amenities of commissioned rank were respected.Many camp administrators were career soldiers who despised the Nazis; others had been transferred after being wounded in action, and had a fellow-feeling for enemies who had been captured. Inmates were encouraged to follow hobbies to take the itch out of their feet. The spirit was akin to that of von Stroheim's World War One schloss in "La Grande Illusion".The scene where a "Hitler greeting" has to be dragged out of Luger is true to life: many senior Wehrmacht officers forbade their subordinates to "heil" in the mess. The massacre after recapture was perpetrated not by soldiers but by the Gestapo at Hitler's command, over protests from Goering and Keitel. The phrase "shot while trying to escape" became common currency as a euphemism for murder.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>POSSIBLE SPOILERS!!Exciting, funny, tragic, with a massive cast who all perform brilliantly, providing many memorable moments, The Great Escape as everyone knows tells the story of the attempted escape of allied troops from German imprisonment. The characters are all well drawn, both Allies and Nazis, and each has a distinct personality, though McQueen's stands out. Even though only a few escape this is still a story of hope to rival The Shawshank Redemption. Memorable scenes are obvious: Steve's biking, Pleasance's tragic end, the celebrations which end in death, the 'get out and stretch your legs' scene, and the train station scene. With beautiful cinematography and a rousing score, this is a favourite for many people-it's shown here every Christmas. Interesting in that this is one of the few films i can think of which has no female character of note. 9 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I imagine it was the lengthy running time that kept me for so many years from seeing The Great Escape, although that doesn't explain why I haven't seen hordes of other movies. But I've been going back and watching all the old classics and The Great Escape is one of the best ones I've seen so far. The movie is not only wildly entertaining throughout it's nearly three hour duration, but shows some actors who went on to become famous for other roles in decades and generations to come. Granted, I am speaking from the perspective of a different generation of moviegoers, which is why I know Charles Bronson more from Death Wish than this film, or James Coburn from films like Payback and Affliction, Donald Pleasance as Dr. Sam Loomis and Richard Attenborough as John Hammond from the Jurassic Park films.I think the thing I loved the most about the movie was how open everyone was about their plans to escape. Not that they tried to escape out in the open, but they made no effort to hide the fact that they were analyzing their surroundings, trying to find a way to get out. As we soon learn, it is their sworn duty as captured officers to consistently try to escape and, failing that, to make life as confusing and frustrating as humanly possible for their captors. The story involves a lot of British officers being held captive by the Germans, at a prison where all of the most consistent escapers have been compiled for special supervision. When the prisoners arrive at the beginning of the movie, many of them, including Virgil Hilts (Steve McQueen) walk into the gates and then immediately walk to the fences around the outsides of the compound, looking up and down the length of the fences, studying where the guard towers are, looking in broad daylight for ways to escape.What follows is a brilliant competition between the proud British officers being held captive and the Germans guarding them, as the British make every attempt to escape and receive minimal punishment when they're caught. 20 days in the cooler for a failed escape attempt (doubled from only 10 for mouthing off) is pretty light compared to what I would have expected POWs to have suffered at the hands of the Nazis in World War II.Because the escapes are only hidden during their preparations, there are portions of The Great Escape that play almost like a sports movie more than a war film, because of the atmosphere of competition and, among other things, there is so much comic relief, One of my favorite scenes is the one where they first begin digging under the floor in their bunker. Danny Velinski (Bronson) is under the floor digging away when the Germans march in for a surprise inspection, and he jumps out, they put the cover back on the hole and smear clay around it and then pour water into it, one guy starts mopping the floor, everyone else goes back to playing cards or milling about, and Velinski hops in the shower, and the suspicious officers come in and demand to know what they're each doing. The guy mopping explains that he's mopping, Velinski says he needed a wash, and Louis Sedgwick (Coburn), says about Velinski, "I'm watching him. I'm a lifeguard!"It's also a great scene when Hilts (McQueen) tells Bartlett (Attenborough) and the other officer his plan for escape. Steve McQueen is the star of the movie but spends most of it pretty much out of the loop. He was in the cooler when the plans for the great escape were first hatched, so when he finally got out most of the camp was involved in planning this epic breakout, and Hilts comes up to Bartlett and one other officer and gleefully tells them about his and Ives' nutty plan to burrow three feet down and dig straight out, sticking metal tubes through the ground to the surface so they can breathe. Bartlett and the other officer leave both of them out of the plans for the time being, for reasons that are explained later in the film.The movie is expertly written, with outstanding dialogue and even better performances and direction that I like to think is still inspiring filmmakers throughout the world. I learned from another reviewer on the IMDb that the music is almost competing within itself, with different instruments representing the British and the Germans, so I was watching for it when I watched the movie. Not only is the different music representative of the two opposing sides, but it does it within scenes and even within individual shots. Consider, for example, the scene where Hilts and Ives are first brought into the cooler. The music is almost reacting to what is going on on screen, like it's trying to describe where each character is within the frame. That is true film-making brilliance. The movie ends with a massive setback, a tremendous downturn in tone, but does so without turning into a tragedy or overshadowing everything else that has gone on before that and, most importantly, while remaining true to the real life story. It displays the pride and determination of British military as well as was done in The Bridge on the River Kwai, and that is a major accomplishment. Bravo.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Germans open their new POW camp and send the invites to every British and American escape artist out there. So while waiting for their garden to reap a harvest, they all decide to tunnel out of the place. The tunnel is discovered, but they still have two other ones they're working on so they continue on, even though there are the problems of the forger losing his sight, and one of the tunnel diggers being claustrophobic. They dig out but find themselves 30 feet short of the forest they were going to escape into and the Germans pick up their trail. 3 POW's make it out, 23 are captured and returned to the camp and the remaining 50 are executed. Based on a true story ( with some factual errors, and influenced by Jean Renoir's 1937 film, Grand Illusion ), this film moves very quickly with an adventureous pace and well acted roles, particularly Steve McQueen as the American motorcycling hotshot, Richard Attenbourough as the escape team head, and James Garner as the scrounger. Rating 10 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Awesome warlike movie with memorable images and outstanding acting by well-known faces</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a splendid film about a daring breakout from inescapable Nazi concentration camp , Stalag Luft North , with all star cast and magnificently realized by John Sturges . It's partially based on facts adapted by James Clavell and W.R. Burnett from a bestselling written by Paul Brickhill . The continuous escapes have caused the Nazi staff ordered 'putting all the rotten eggs in one basket' as the prisoners are reunited into a special concentration camp . It deals with hard preparatives of a diverse group formed by rebel air officers and soldiers mounting a dangerous getaway from a barbed-wired and strongly controlled camp . The most part of the film concerns on the elaborated process of secretly digging an underground tunnel and the last one deals with spectacular breakout and effort the approx. 70 escaped prisoners throughout Germany trying to make their bid to freedom , including an impressive motorcycle pursuit in charge of iconic Steve McQueen for one of the best action sequences in years .This exciting story contains thrills, intrigue, tension, excitement galore, entertainment and lots of fun . Suspenseful WWII epic packs exceptional plethora of prestigious actors incarnating the motley group of POWs , giving good acting and support , as a sensational Steve McQueen whose character , ¨The Cooler King¨ , remains today as attractive iconography ; Charles Bronson as digging expert but suffering claustrophobia ; Donald Pleasance as professional on forge documents but blind , James Coburn as roguish Australian and of course Richard Attenborough as Air Force Squadron leader who plans the massive breakout , furthermore , James Garner as American officer , the British Gordon Jackson and David McCallum, among others . Colorful, atmospheric cinematography shot in Bavaria,Germany, by Daniel Fapp and perfectly remastered . Excellent production design and art direction with evocative sets by Fernando Carrere. Rousing and lively soundtrack , nowadays a classic score, by Elmer Bernstein . This blockbuster is followed by inferior TV sequel with Christopher Reeve, Judd Hirsch , Ian McShane and directed Jud Taylor who played to Goff in the original version . The motion picture is magnificently directed By John Sturges , author of various classic Western as ¨Escape from Fort Bravo, Gunfight at the OK Corral, The law and Jake Wade, Magnificent seven¨ and also realized another nice wartime film as ¨ The eagle has landed ¨ . Rating : Two thumbs up , essential and indispensable watching , a real must see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The perfect film for holiday afternoons</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>More or less guaranteed to be shown during holiday afternoons this is based on a true story. During WW2 the germans create a prison where they house all the most notorious escapees. It's a plan that is either ingenious, if they can keep everyone in, or stupid, if everyone escapes. As we all know from the movie it turns out to be an idea of the stupid variety.It's very interesting to watch the documentaries on the escape and discussions on whether it was worth it. The german officer that killed the escapees was following orders and was eventually executed himself after the war which is also a very interesting moral question. Should he have disobeyed the orders and been shot and did he deserve to die for obeying the orders.Anyway back to the film and it seems hard to believe that anybody could have not seen this. The Steve McQueen bike ride has gone into cinema folklore. The main purpose of the escape is to cause as much trouble as possible to the germans and thereby aide the allies. A great film, but also a sad story.</fullReview>

A few fellow reviewers have cited the unbelievably "pristine" prison conditions, but the German authorities did try to uphold the Geneva Convention for Western Allied POWs. The characters in this film left their well-run 'stalag' anyway, and many paid the ultimate price.

		<fullReview>There are few adventure stories as great as this. The movie never flags - it uses its wonderfully large cast to perfect effect - everyone will have his favorite characters - the colors, the music, the sense of a wonderful adventure is just magnetic.It is interesting to think of how VERY different this movie could have been in different screenwriters and directors' hands. It is easy to imagine a very dark movie about an escape plan for 250 spoiled so that it involved only 76, and of the 76, 60 massacred and only a very few escaping - a story of frustration, of man's hopes destroyed, of the darkness of life. It would be interesting to see such a version - perhaps something like The Piano or Schindler's List.Instead somehow, the movie makes the viewer feel GREAT - vibrant, happy, enthusiastic, excited! It's remarkable that this story could be made to do this - I think much is due to the energy of a large group working with such dedication and teamwork, much is due to the wonderful music, much is due to the very attractiveness of the actors themselves.For me, there is something terribly appealing about the David McCallum character, Ashley-Pitt - his sacrifice to save the leader (and thus the entire operation), his looks, his manner. And something very touching about the Garner-Pleasance characters operating in tandem. Attenborough is himself properly subdued, authoritative, commanding - and Jackson is an excellent sidekick.I've always liked James Donald very much in everything - particularly as the conscience of The Bridge on the river Kwai - he's in the same form here.If you have heard the term, the "Anglosphere" in recent years, one can see a vivid illustration of it here - the Australian-American-English-Scottish team working perfectly - with the same sense of values to be pursued and preserved, the same sense of humor, dedication.This is just wonderful for anyone - but perhaps particularly for men since there aren't any women in it at all!</fullReview>

They are told that there will be no escapes from this camp by the German officers, but they have made one mistake. They have literally, put all known escapees together 'in one basket' and they set about to do what they do best - ESCAPE!

		<shortDescription>one of the finest war movies of them all</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILERS In Britain today, there are films in the mainstream which are considered iconic. Often due to a sense of pride (Michael Caine in "The Italian Job" for example), these films remind us of our heritage. One such film is "The Great Escape". Containing some of the finest American and British actors of their generation, this film captured the spirit of patriotism from the Second World War and would adorn the walls of teenagers for years.In a German Prisoner Of War Camp, escape is in the minds of all the captives. Led by Squadron Leader Roger Bartlett (Sir Richard Attenborough), plans are underway to dig a tunnel through to the outside. Now the likes of Attenborough, James Garner, Charles Bronson, James Coburn and Steve McQueen will dig for their freedom.Led by McQueen and Attenborough, the cast of this film smacks of talent. There is no way to get past how good some of the performances are. Sir Attenborough in particular plays the role to perfection as a man with a mission and the lives of so many men in his hands.This film also contains one of the most famous soundtracks ever known. A tune which would be used by England Football Fans years later, it inspires patriotism the instant it begins.It's very difficult to explain what makes "The Great Escape" so good. Whilst overlong towards the end, it never ceases to entertain and it remains satisfying and enjoyable throughout. Despite the fact that Steve McQueen somehow manages to possess a leading headline, the film remains predominantly British, and it remains a joy to watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a great movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I checked this out from the library video stacks. It had Steve McQueen in it, so I figured what the heck? To my surprise this is a great movie. What a cast! Richard Attenborough, Donald Pleasence, Steve McQueen,James Coburn,James Garner, Charles Brosan and David Mccallum. Most of these guys before they got famous as well. One could spent hours creating spy and western connections between the cast. The movie builds up suspense well. You really want them to escape from that camp. Unlike most war movies, this movie actually injects some humor into it.(the moonshine scene a good example)The European scenery is beautiful. It's quite heart wrenching with the escapees get killed or sent back to camp. I'm really glad Hollywood didn't sugar coat it with a happy ending. It would have destroyed the drama. But there's two things that bother me about this movie.1. James Coburn's aussie accent. Auuggghhhh!2. They make the POW camp seem almost like summer camp.They even study birds for pete's sake. At girl scout camp we had cabins that looked almost identical to the ones in the film. In fact some of the camps I went to looked amazingly like the POW camp in this movie. Hmmmmm I wonder. Anyway they make it seem like a POW camp isn't really that horrible a place to be.Overall a few flaws, but a movie that is deserving of 'classic' status.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>All in all, a WW2 epic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Great Escape is definitely one of my favorite movies. I remember seeing it at the drive-in when I was about 6. My parents always brought me a blanket so I could sleep in the back seat, but I stayed up for this one. The cast is excellent, with many memorable characters. Steve McQueen is at his peak, along with James Garner and Richard Attenborough. Based on a true story, a group of POWs from many allied nations plan a daring tunnel escape from a German camp. We see them plan, prepare, and dig the tunnels (3) as they elude detection from their captors. I have only one issue; the conditions of the camp are presented as a little too pristine, not dirty or squalid as in other POW movies like Stalag 17 or Von Ryan's Express. The prisoners here are always well fed and well groomed, with cleaned and pressed uniforms. But that can be overlooked because overall, the movie is excellent. The actual escape is filled with suspense, and the last hour of the movie we see them on the run, by plane, train, on foot, and in McQueen's case, by motorcycle. By this time, we are rooting for each character as they all try to make it out of Germany. All in all, a WW2 epic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A classic moment for the stars</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Apart from the fact that it was a unique and great adventure epic, The Great Escape made important contributions to the career of a number of American and British male stars and would-be stars. This was due in part to director/producer John Sturges' particular intuition for the choice of actors and to effective, well-balanced characterizations which served as vehicles to several their players. Interestingly, none of the film's performers were big stars at the time and only McQueen, Garner and Attenbourough were well-known leading men. Primarily, the movie of course launched Steve McQueen to major stardom, only a few years after Sturges' The Magnificent Seven established the actor's lone hero persona on the big screen. McQueen stands out as a daring and cynical individualist, who appears unmoved and downright impertinent when being thrown in and out of the prison camp's cooler, and culminates in a classic motorcycle chase. But in a somewhat less glamorous manner, James Garner arguably gives a superior performance as the "scrounger", the prisoner gathering most of the essential materials of the escape through his wit, relaxed charm and resourcefulness. McQueen's admittedly impressive characterization sometimes comes a bit too close to parody and spectacular heroics, in the end lacking some credibility. Garner, on the other hand, manages a more subtle, understated humour, not distracting from the seriousness of his work and the stakes involved in the escape. Meanwhile, Richard Attenborough is also excellent as the mastermind of the escape, forcefully portraying a man convinced of his mission and ready to make sacrifices and ruthless decisions to achieve it. From the rest of the cast, Charles Bronson probably stands out most, projecting strength and determination as the head of the tunnel diggers, while towards the end, effectively conveying a vulnerable, tortured side of his character (even though the fact that the "Tunnel King" turns out to be a closet claustrophobic stretches credibility somewhat). Donald Pleasance gives some outstanding pieces of acting when his character gradually turns blind before the escape. The evolution of his friendship with Garner provides an interesting plot and character development, as Pleasance's traditional British ways and habits contrasts amusingly with Garner's easy-going and open American style. James Donald also does very well as the senior British officer, providing thoughtful, sensitive and self-effacing leadership. The other protagonists do not have sufficient screen time to make their characters more than moderately interesting, but James Coburn shines as a brash Australian who ends up escaping on a stolen bicycle, David McCallum has some brief but noticeable moments, particularly when disguised as a German civilian during his escape, and Gordon Jackson gives some bright support to Attenbourough, providing a human touch to balance the excessive seriousness of the latter's character. The attention spent to the fate and personality traits of all these characters, enliven by the engaging and usually flawless acting of the players, had much to do in creating and maintaining the interest of The Great Escape, making it a lot more than a big and exciting action film. For McQueen, Garner, Attenborough, Bronson, Coburn, Pleasance and McCallum, The Great Escape represents some of the finest moments in their long illustrious careers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Escape and the Cooler King</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Back in 1963, a war film arrived on the silver screen which set the standard for all dramas which followed. True there were other great war films such as The War Lover and Twelve O'Clock High, but none of them became the launching point for so many of Hollywood's great screen stars. Paul Brickhill wrote the original true story upon which this film is based on. Furthermore, with Elmer Berstein's rousing musical score, this movie then becomes nothing short of genuine classic. The saga of "The Great Escape" is wound around the actual war time experiences of American and British Airmen, who'd been captured and sent to what the German High Command called 'An Escape proof' prisoner of War Camp. Upon seeing the assortment of Hollywood elite, one can not expect anything but great drama and action adventure from the entire cast. Steve McQueen, who plays Capt. Virgil Hilts, "The Cooler King" leads an all star line up which consists of James Garner as Hendley "The Scrounger", Richard Attenborough as Squadron Leader Roger Bartlett, James Donald as Group Capt. Ramsey "The Senior British Officer", Charles Bronson is memorable as Danny Velinski "The Tunnel King", Donald Pleasence as Blythe, James Coburn as Louis Sedgwick, David McCallum as Ashley-Pitt and Gordon Jackson as MacDonald. They are imprisoned and guarded by Germany's elite guards, commanded by Col. Von Luger (Hannes Messemer) who has been personally selected for the task. Since it's inception, this film has garnered a commanding cult following. It's status is notable as the vehicle which literally propels McQueen up into his stardom. *****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An All-Time Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the all-time great films, "The Great Escape" is simply flawless and unforgettable. A legendary cast -- Steve McQueen, Charles Bronson, James Garner and Richard Attenborough among them -- stars as a stubborn group of Second World War POWs who aren't content to wait out the end of battle. So they secretly dig a tunnel to take them beyond their prison camp's borders. Yet that's only one component of the escape plan, which also requires forged documents, civilian clothing, and tons of luck -- all of which they managed to scrounge up against incredible odds.A brilliant blend of character study, suspense and humor, "The Great Escape" is more than a film; it's an experience. It will have you rooting on the heroes and holding your breath. It will captivate and move you. "The Great Escape" represents everything that's magnificent about motion pictures. It doesn't skip a beat more than four decades after its release, and it's suitable for all ages.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie could easily make my top 15 of all time. From what I have read, it was QUITE realistic. Several of the British officers that were actually there went to the site in Germany when it was filmed. When something was wrong, they spoke up and got it fixed. (This has been on the History Channel several times.) There were almost no Americans, if any, at the time of escape. They had been moved to another camp only a couple of weeks prior to the escape. Many of the prime characters were based on actual people, most notably Attenborough. I also read the book (about 30 years ago) in high school pm which the movie was based. They had photos the Germans took of the tunnels. The movie was incredibly accurate. The tracks, the air pumps, lights, etc. It isn't the movie that was amazing, it was what the prisoners did. As far as how the prisoners were treated, for the most part, relatively well. The death rate in a German POW camp was about 1-2%. In a Japanese prison camp, about 35% of the Allied prisoners died, due to murder, torture, disease, starvation, etc. The Luftwaffe, headed by Fatso Goering, guarded Allied airman because Goering had a weird sense of camaraderie with fellow flyers. The Gestapo or SS are the ones who shot the 50 prisoners. These war criminals were later faced war crimes trials. This is one hell of a movie. But find the book yourself.</fullReview>

The new "campers" include Roger Bartlett (Sir Richard Attenborough) or the "Big X", Bob Hendley (James Garner) "The Scrounger", and of course Virgil Hilts (Steve McQueen) "The Cooler". Along with others like Charles Bronson, James Coburn, and Donald Pleasance, a group of about 250 men are determined to escape this Nazi hell hole.An intricate system of signals and distractions keep the goons off of their backs. The plan is to tunnel out of the camp into the nearby wooded area. From their they will disguise themselves are German citizens and make their way back to their respective countries. This will require clothing, paperwork, acting, and other supplies needed to blend in and look normal to a German Officer outside of the camp.This true story of how soldier's tried to outsmart the German's is one that is fascinating and amusing. The little things like hiding supplies, the tunnels, and the immense amount of dirt is incredible and quite ingenious. Imagine trying to tunnel deep enough underground so no one knows what you're doing and keeping it undercover. Not to mention sneaking 250 people out at once. It's quite a challenge.This war drama is one of the best of it's era and genre of all time. What sets this movie apart from the rest is a riveting story added with some Hollywood magic to bring it back to life. Although some parts of the movie are stretched from the truth, it still tells a true story in an entertaining fashion.Director John Sturges does the story of the "Great Escape" a lot of justice, showing it to a wide variety of people. The Great Escape is timeless!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best war film ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My fifth favourite film of all time, it gets my vote as the best war film ever made. I love that its focus on is not a great battle but the ingenuity and bravery of ordinary men in an extraordinary situation. The film is a thrilling, rollicking adventure with moments of great escapism but at the same time it is often moving and it's extremely well characterised. The film is incredibly well structured. It may be 2 hours and 43 minutes long yet it drags for less than two minutes of that time.As it says at the beginning of the film, the characters are fictionalised composites of the Stalag Luft III inmates but it hues closely to the events surrounding the actual Great Escape. It's a film that respects the audience's intelligence. There is no happy ending. In the film, as in real life, only 3 of the 76 escapees managed to evade capture and 50 of those who were recaptured were murdered. The film is dedicated to their memory.It has one of the best casts of any film that I've ever seen and John Sturges' direction is fantastic. I don't think that there's anyone who gives a bad performance. Sturges also directed my fourth favourite film, "The Magnificent Seven", in which Steve McQueen, James Coburn and Charles Bronson also starred. Both films certainly benefit from excellent scores by Elmer Bernstein.I liked the fact that not all of the Nazis are treated as being completely evil. Werner, who disappears after the first half sadly, doesn't seem too different from the kind of soldier that you'd find in any army and even the camp commandment Colonel von Luger shows a glimmer of conscience when he tells Ramsey that 50 of the escapees have been shot.They don't make them like this anymore. I'm glad that the film was made in 1963 because I doubt that it would be made with the same subtlety, intelligence or attention to detail now. They would probably give it a Hollywood style ending.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>John Sturges Takes You Prisoner</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1942, Allied prisoners of World War II who repeatedly try to escape are placed by the Germans in a maximum security camp called "Stalag Luft III". As you might expect, they try to escape. Repeatedly. Giving the prisoners a lot of time to meet without supervision, the Germans may be foreshadowing the "Hogan's Heroes" TV series that poked fun at this film. Top-billed is super-cool Steve McQueen (as Virgil Hilts). He's always earning himself solitary confinement. You'll notice Mr. McQueen looks sharper coming out of "The Cooler" than he does going in, sliding his jacket down the wall of the cell without fear of scratching the leather. That's cool...Also billed above the title are super-nice James Garner (as Bob Hendley) and mastermind Richard Attenborough (as Roger Bartlett), who travels with English-accented Gordon Jackson (as Andy "Mac" MacDonald). Known as a scrounger, Mr. Garner takes commendable action when told his forger pal Donald Pleasance (as Colin Blythe) should not go on "The Great Escape" due to a disability. Garner insists on taking his friend, although it will risk the mission - and both their lives. That's nice...Most valuable players may be muscular Charles Bronson (as Danny Velinski) and his blond companion John Leyton (as William "Willie" Dickes). These two tunnel diggers actually love each other; you can't definitively say they are gay, but you can't definitively say they aren't, either. Most surprising are the number of people who actually make it out successfully, with Australian manufacturer James Coburn (as Louis Sedgwick) being the second most likely to succeed, due to his choosing not to travel light. British sailor David McCallum (as Eric Ashley-Pitt) develops ways to disperse dirt, and Angus Lennie (as Archibald "Archie" Ives) is a short-lived favorite...Senior British officer James Donald (as Ramsey) holds down the fort and Hannes Messemer (as Oberst von Luger) humanizes the opposition with a notably "Best Supporting Actor" worthy performance. Nicely produced and directed by John Sturges, "This is a true story. Although the characters are composites of real men and time and place have been compressed, every detail of the escape is the way it really happened." Helping Mr. Sturges in the production are composer Elmer Bernstein, photographer Daniel L. Fapp, and film editor Ferris Webster. This movie is a little long and probably not all that accurate, but "The Great Escape" is a great one.********* The Great Escape (6/20/63) John Sturges ~ Steve McQueen, James Garner, Richard Attenborough, Charles Bronson</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Being not too familiar with the original back story, I had higher hopes for this film. Too much film was spent on the minute details, which do have a place, but it made the movie about 50 minutes too long. Very little time was placed on the actual escape, although what they did show was rewarding. Some of the details revealed were McGuffins: they didn't really add to the plot, although I'm sure the writers intentions were to show the lengths that these prisoners went to in their plans to escape their German captors.I was disappointed (very) in the climax and ending. I have no need to watch this film again. It just wasn't satiating as entertainment, although the acting was superb.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A facinating portrayal of characters ranging from American to English to Australian who are held prisoner in an allied POW camp. With Richard Attenborough as the leader and Steve McQueen as the unforgettable "Cooler King" who tries and tries again unsucessfully to escape from the enemy prison. Filmed on location with beautiful cinematography (especially in widescreen) of the German countryside, The Great Escape tells the true story of a mass plan to escape not only the camp but Nazi Germany as well via underground tunnels. A highly organized exodus strung together by intricate coordination using where everyone involved has a job to do. Escape from Germany uses every means possible whether it be by boat, plane, bike, motorcycle, or train. Great near finale scene with McQueen (who did all his own stunts) trying to jump over the Swiss border on motorcycle while being pursude on all sides by the enemy. A must see wonder which I find a little underrated. 4 stars/4 stars</fullReview>

Whether this was based on a true story or not, it was done well enough to keep my interest while waiting to see who would get out of the camp. Great acting by all (loved the Donald Pleasence part, Garner and Bronson) - beautifully photographed and great musical score.

Of course I would do that with "any" McQueen movie but this is his best with a top multi-star cast. For Escape movies fans I can't recommend really anything like this one, especially in a war setting; perhaps the sole exception could be the Grand Illusion, the French classic from the 30's in quite a different setting. There are plenty of other "escape" movies in a civil setting, though (involving jail escapes). For McQueen fans I'd recommend any of his movies: he managed to get always fun and interesting roles that fit his character completely: Thomas Crown Affair, Cincinnati Kid, Papillon (talk 'bout a Escape movie!), The Getaway (with Ali Mc Graw- great fun- a must to see).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Great Escape is certainly among the top 5 films ever made of World War II. Steve McQueen is superb, even though his part was written as they went along. You've got to love James Garner the scrounger and helpmate the Donald Pleasance (The Forger) and interestingly a prisoner of war himself. John Sturges the Producer/Director had just come off "The Magnificent Seven" so he was as hot as the core of the sun. Basically the film is about the indominable will of the human spirit. It chronicals the greatest escape attempt of the war, what it doesn't tell you is that it diverted the attention of nearly a million German soldiers from the landing on D-Day. A magnificent epic, gorgeously transfered in its original 2.35:1 aspect ratio with a score by Elmer Bernstein that will ring in your ears for a good week after watching the film. 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>WE'RE not sitting out this war comfortably!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In one of the first of the multi-superstar war films (following on the heels of the biggest one, The Longest Day), The Great Escape follows the planning and execution of a massive escape attempt from a Nazi POW camp during World War II by Allied prisoners. The determination of these men and the absolute thoroughness of their plan is what's on center stage here. Led by Richard Attenborough (back when he was just an actor, not an Academy award-winning director), the men decide to tunnel out of the camp in three places - this way, if one tunnel is discovered by the Germans, the other two tunnels will still be viable options.Attenborough's not the big star here, though; that honor goes to the young Steve McQueen, with that rebellious smile and blonde locks going a long way toward cementing his own movie superstardom. Oh, and James Garner, and Charles Bronson as a Russian (!), James Coburn, and even Donald Pleasance as a myopic forger. Who will survive the escape? And what will happen to those who do once they've left the walls of the prison?If you're a fan of action, this is a prime movie for you. If you're a fan of suspense, this is also a prime movie for you. Above all, if you're a fan of excellent writing, acting, and direction (by John Sturges), then you'll enjoy this 3-hour opus.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>THE GREAT ESCAPE is another overrated "classic" that somehow seems to stumble along film history on its good reputation. Very little about it is great, as the title suggests, and so one sits through 170+ minutes only partly enjoying the company of POWs in a Nazi camp. A Nazi camp however that's pretty far removed from anything I've imagined, heard or read about German Concentration Camps during WWII, as the film portrays it as quite a relaxed and sunny condition. The characters we're in it for are a bunch of guys that tods along happily enough aiming to escape, and while there are several neat moments among them, one character seems unclear; Steve McQueen's Captain Hilts, if not a weird character, certainly an annoying performance by McQueen. Through the hours of planing the escape, the jovial and cheerful mood of the film helped me get through it, and as we're headed out at the end I felt disappointed, as the supposed great climax is somehow disjointed and lackluster.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>McQueen's Breakout Role Lifts Muddy Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Great Escape" is okay popcorn fare, a "true-ish" World War II movie that serves the facts of the real story of Stalag Luft III decently and serves the film's stars better. That's particularly true of one star, Steve McQueen, who had his most famous five minutes on screen cycling across Bavaria and never looked back.McQueen is Virgil Hilts, a "hotshot pilot" from the U.S. Army Air Force who makes for one restless POW. "I haven't seen Berlin yet, from the ground or from the air," he tells the commandant of his prison camp, Col. von Lugar (Hannes Messemer). "I plan on doing both before the war's over." Hilts isn't the only one in the camp with big plans. The British, led by Squadron Leader Roger Bartlett (Richard Attenborough), plot a breakout involving no less than 250 inmates. "You're crazy...You oughta be locked up," Hilts tells Bartlett, pretty funny given their situation.Was Bartlett's scheme really such a good idea, even if you factor out the Nazi propensity for brutal overreaction? I can't say I think it was, and maybe that's one mark I'd make against a film that pretty much celebrates the real-life episode as a majestic sacrifice rather than a glory-hound escapade that backfired horribly. The success rate certainly didn't justify the supposed benefit Bartlett speaks of, tying up a few German troops who were on garrison duty anyway and hardly shoring up the Dnieper River Line.There are other issues I have with "The Great Escape". At two hours, fifty-two minutes, it's way overlong, with all but the last 45 minutes concerned with prep work. A script that was famously being written on the run creates various dramatic subplots involving the many characters which come and go as abruptly as James Coburn's Aussie accent.What director John Sturges and his team do bring to "The Great Escape" is undeniable texture, a feeling for prison-camp life that feels real even as it plays at Sgt. Fury-style heroics. A cast who knew World War II all-too-well but were willing to pretend it was more adventure then nightmare also contribute. The one standout besides McQueen is second-billed James Garner as Hendley "the scrounger", whose scenes with both Donald Pleasance (as a fellow inmate, a "forger" going blind) and Robert Graf (as German guard Werner) account for much of the film's erratic charm. The rousing Elmer Bernstein score is instantly recognizable and hummable, and there's McQueen, in what seems the third and most significant stage of Sturges' star-making program, after "Never So Few" and "The Magnificent Seven."Hilts is a strange center of gravity for "The Great Escape", spending most of his time away from the action, stuck in a cooler bouncing a baseball to himself while Attenborough directs things. Attenborough is a bit stiff; one senses his heart wasn't in the role. McQueen does get more involved in the plot as it rolls along, collecting bunk slats to buttress the tunnel being dug beneath the camp. He's not as loose as he would be later on; and struggles a bit with the more comedic scenes. Whoever came up with the idea of him marching through the camp playing a fife probably was drinking too much potato vodka. But his confrontations with von Lugar, scrunching his face into a cocky grin, give the film much of the lift it has when he's not on that motorcycle.Messemer may have the film's most interesting role; a sympathetic Luftwaffe officer who pushes back when the Gestapo and SS tell him to take a firmer hand. He's a good man, even if he knows he's serving a bad cause, and his scenes with both McQueen and James Donald as the head British POW give you a sense of the emotional toll of war even when the combatants involved are decent.Many people like this film better than I do, and bless them. It's smart and entertaining; sometimes both at once. You can't help but be moved by the story behind the film, real as it was. Too bad the question of "was it worth it" is never satisfactorily presented, let alone answered.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hogan Never Had It So Good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film had a stellar cast, and most of them delivered. The score was unusually cheerful and eerie, too. A strange combination. In reality, allied POW's in German detention camps were treated with contempt and without mercy. What we have in this film, however, are a bunch of guys who act like they belong in a country club. The country club/summer camp they reside in is a fun place, except you'll get shot if they catch you climbing the fence. That's it - no mention of the terrible brutality these guys actually endured or the fact that they were given barely enough food to live on. No mention of the atrocities regularly visited upon them by their Nazi captors, including beatings, executions, and forced marches. Instead, we get gentlemanly or comical Germans who seem to actually care what the POW's think of them.James Garner's character seems to epitomize the relaxed country club type who seems to be on vacation. He never takes off his turtleneck, which, no doubt, would cause the average person to perspire and stink after awhile. Steve McQueen, as usual, was the coolest guy in the room, but why would the Nazis allow him to have a baseball and glove to keep himself amused while in solitary confinement? Why didn't they just shoot him or beat the hell out of him after he was captured? Instead, they treated him like a naughty school boy. Richard Attenborough turned in a fine performance, but in reality, the Nazis would have never allowed him to take such a leadership role among the other prisoners. They would have singled him out and broken him instead of giving him respect.The film had many powerful moments: the motorcycle chase, the fatal error on the bus, the massacre, the shooting of the fence climber....these were all extremely well done. The film ultimately failed, though, because it did a disservice to the men who actually lived through this by failing to convey the wretched conditions of a German POW camp.The film had many moments where you had to suspend reality for such banal situations. Why in the world would the Nazis have ever allowed the Americans to hold a 4th of July celebration that include a parade, a picnic, and free-flowing vodka? Why would they allow a still on the premises to make homemade vodka from potatoes? Where did the Americans find a large American flag and why were they allowed to run it up a flagpole? Where did they find the smaller 13-star flag to wave around? Wasn't it out of character for Hilts to suddenly become a master flutist, blowing out a flawless rendition of "Yankee Doodle"? Colonel Klink would never have allowed Hogan and the boys such privileges! I'm surprised the Nazi guards didn't bake them cookies! What about when Hilts took out the planks from the bunkbeds (all of them) to use to reinforce the tunnel? The beds were now unusable, but the Germans didn't seem to notice all the guys sleeping on the floor, I guess. I could go on and on about these lapses in reality and this is why I wouldn't recommend this film for anyone over the age of 11. Add to this the 1960's film making habit of over illuminating all indoor scenes to the point where it seems like the actors need to wear sunglasses, and you have a very poor rendering of a POW camp. Was I the only one who noticed that the interactions and dialogue of these impeccably dressed and well-groomed men seemed like the goings-on in an upscale gay social club?</fullReview>

It is the thing that prisoners must do. The actors are all very good. Steve McQueen is my favorite--not because he is the best actor, but because he is so cool. Nobody makes riding a bike into a barbed wire fence more imitable than he. James Garner is perfect as the "Scrounger". I like the scenes where he is working on the German soldier.

		<fullReview>I gave this film a 9 out of 10. The only reason I didn't give it a 10 is because it tells one lie. No Americans actually participated in the escape.It is a historical fact that the escape was originally to be made by the Americans, but their tunnel, Tom, was discovered by German camp guards just a few days before the scheduled break. The movie shows how Tom was busted, but unfortunately does not reveal that it was the American tunnel. The second tunnel, Dick, was used instead, but that particular tunnel originated in a British barracks; therefore all the escapees were in fact British soldiers.Other than that, the rest of the details were unusually accurate, given the fact that Hollywood is not well known for sticking with facts. The Great Escape is an excellent chronology of a group of brave men attempting a nearly-impossible task with an amazing degree of success.The actual escape belongs on the list of greatest human efforts in history, and the movie belongs on the list of greatest films ever made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic escape by POWs...excellent work by all-male cast...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If ever there was a film that calls for ensemble acting by an all-male cast, this is it. And no one lets you down--all are at the peak of their performing talents--James Garner, Steve McQueen, Richard Attenborough, Donald Pleasance, Charles Bronson, James Coburn, David McCallum.There is no letdown in the purely "escapist" overall enjoyment of the film either--sorry for the pun. At times, it seems almost like fun to be in a prisoner of war camp where everybody is so chummy and having a good time as they plot and plan their marvelous but dangerous escape. The plot whirls forward in such a breezy manner that it hardly seems possible the film is as lengthy as it is--well over two and a half hours. Details of the escape are photographed expertly.An impressive offbeat performance by Charles Bronson as the claustrophobic man who digs the tunnel comes as somewhat of a surprise. He turns out to be one of the few lucky escapees. After the escape, the film follows the adventures of several of them as, in turn, each one almost gets away with their plan. Only grim note in their adventures is the machine-gunning episode of 50 men who are told to get out of a truck in the middle of a field "for exercise". And a lasting impression is made by the vivid way the photography captures McQueen's brazen attempt to escape on motorbike through the Bavarian countryside. Stunningly photographed and impressively scored. McQueen's chase scene is nothing short of spectacular, best seen on wide screen version.Surprisingly, the only Oscar nomination was for film editing.Escape films about POWs don't get any better--or more entertaining--than this one. By all means see it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not totally inaccurate</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Several user comments fault the movie for being unrealistic in its portrayal of conditions in the POW camp. There are some reasons why I think the portrayal of Stalag Luft III is not as far off as one might think.First, Germany subscribed to the Geneva Convention and for the most part abided by it. Remember, these were POW camps, not concentration camps.Second, the POW camps for flyers were run by Luftwaffe personnel, not the Gestapo or the SS.Third, all the POWs depicted in the film were Allied officers, and officers rated special treatment. Most German officers were not Nazis and were from the old-school Prussian tradition, where the officer class was presumed to be from the elite of society, if not the nobility, and they usually treated officer prisoners accordingly.The only part of the portrayal that is a bit ridiculous is how well-fed everybody looks. Even if the captors are not brutes to the prisoners, if food is scarce -- as it was at the time -- people are going to get rather thin. It's not likely that big stars in the 1960s were going to lose 20 or 30 pounds to prepare for a film, like some of them do today.Of course there were exceptions to this, and some officer POWs were badly treated. As for the fifty who were executed, that happened because their actions got the attention of the Gestapo and Hitler, which was never a good thing.I fault the filmmakers mainly for adding Steve McQueen's character, every aspect and action of which was complete nonsense. But, it sold tickets! Some people like the cutesy little march music; I hated it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Great Escape lacks emotion and intensity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Great Escape is the type of movie where people from different generations will have wide variation of opinions. People from the so-called "greatest generation" who lived through WWII and may have served in the "war to end all wars" like my grandfather, will probably enjoy this movie. It's good vs. evil in a world where that seemed so evident in life. Allied vs. Axis and the Nazis vs. freedom. This group of airmen will doing anything to escape the clutches of the evil Nazis who are holding them captive.However, the major problem with the movie is that the Nazis don't seem so evil, cruel or stern. There is lack of fear or even concern for the characters because this group of Nazis are well?nice and well-mannered to a fault. You feel like it is a game to everyone involved. The airmen try to escape and they are playfully sent away to the "cooler" with a smile and mild scolding. The next attempts result in the same punishment this time without the smile. Nobody is threatened with a firing squad or sent away to hard labor. The Nazis seem to encourage escape attempts.Having seen recent movies like Schindler's List, Max Manus and Sophie Scholl; the Nazis in these movies aren't so forgiving of war-time transgressions. It just rings false in this movie especially for someone in my generation (genX) or younger. This leads to a lack of intensity or involvement in the movie when you know the characters face little to no consequences for their actions.It doesn't completely ruin the movie because the final third of the movie has some real reasons to finally become involved in the characters because bullets actually start to fly and some characters actually have to fight the enemy. Still the action is stilted and hollow because of the lack of film making expertise and technology, so you don't feel the emotion that you should based on the fatal incidents.The Great Escape has some fun moments with good actors like a young Steve McQueen, James Garner and a less grizzled, almost gentle Charles Bronson. It was enjoyable to see them before they became really famous movie stars. However, this movie doesn't deserve the universal praise that it received from film critics and viewers. If you want to see Steve McQueen in a motorcycle chase this movie is for you. If you want to see an intense prison break during WWII?don't bother with this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Film Has Slowed With Age, But Still Merits Praise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although I still like this film - and proudly own it on disc - I have to admit it was a disappointment seeing it after a long period of time had elapsed between viewings. When I saw this in the theater in 1963, I thought it was spectacular. Later, when it came out on VHS, I thought thought it was good but the longer the years go by, the slower this film gets and it doesn't have the hold on me it once did. Part of that is that movies are faster- moving nowadays.It just takes too long (two hours!) before the "great escape" finally takes place! I loved the last 50 minutes. That, still, was fascinating as much as it ever was, even though it's never been a happy one. It's still good stuff.The first two hours of this 172-minute movie turn out to be more of characterizations that anything else, although it details what went into making the escape from this German prison camp possible. Some of that is interesting, such as Chales Bronson's claustrophobia and Donald Pleasance's eyesight deterioration, etc.With stars like Steve McQueen, James Garner, James Coburn, Richard Attenborough, Bronson, Pleasance and James Donald you will get some characters you'll remember for a long time: especially, I found, McQueen's and Bronson's.Now that it is out on a special two-disc DVD which gives it a decent picture (there was an earlier DVD that wasn't much better than the VHS) and some features, it should climb back up the ladder on my rating of it. Regardless, this will always be considered on the best of the World War II movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not really about a mass escape from a German POW camp but about how cool Hollywood actors of the 60s were.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't claim to have been in WWII?or maybe I was, during a past life? but this I know for sure: life in a German POW camp had nothing to do with what we see in TGE, let alone a POW camp where they had gathered Allied airmen. See, at a time when Allied warplanes were bombing German cities to dust the German populace had developed a deep hatred for all them and when they had the chance to get their hands on one of them the poor sap was lucky if all he got, before the local military came to get him, was just a good beating. In fact a number of them were lynched by irate mobs. Not to mention that many had had to bail out from their burning planes and then land on mud, water, bushes; had to spend hours, days, hiding in barns, forests, running for their lives, before being caught. And that some of their camp wardens had suffered themselves the effects of their bombing, lost homes, probably dear ones because of it and so were in no mood for youthful pranks. Not, life wasn't a picnic in those German POW camps. Not to mention that the Luftwaffe was a Nazi haven, Goering's baby. And yet what we see here is more like a group of well fed and contended, sharp and alert vacationers arriving to their resort in the heart of nature. If it wasn't for the guns you could even picture the German guards handing out leaflets with the activities of the day while Hendley looks for a comfy spot where to light up his pipe and engage in some good reading.But things don't get any better as we trod along, as we are next subjected to a stream of usual 60s war flick clichés, not the smallest of them that of the decent, fair, even likable German military officers who "are just doing their duty", as opposed to the dastardly Gestapo and SS goons. If you have seen enough of these U.S-U.K war flicks of the 50s, 60s you got to be familiar with the obvious dichotomy. Now, while I am sure that there were many honest and fair German military fighting in that war?despite the well known complicity of the brass of the Wehrmacht with the atrocities of the Nazis?the fact that they are a staple in these war flicks is not so much due to Hollywood's regard for historical truths as due to necessities of the Cold War, which by the 60s was going full steam. As Germany had gone from enemy to NATO ally, it wasn't anymore sensible to depict their military men as murderous brutes?as it was the case during the war of course?so they got around all it just putting all their bad deeds on the shoulders of the SS and Gestapo. That is the main reason why there are always nice, good, fair Germans in these war flicks.Now, if TGE is already looking pretty unrealistic by the moment McQueen's Hilts appears, with him it turns into a real masquerade. For one, Hilts must be the only man in History who comes out of a month in solitary confinement in a German POW camp looking far better than he did when he got in. With clean clothes?remember, he had entered all covered in mud?impeccable, well groomed, perfectly shaved. (Who washed his clothes, who cut, combed, his hair there, who gave him such clean shaves?) I'm not fan of Guns of Navarone, but compared to this one it looks like Shakespeare because, despite all its shortcomings it still has that aura of reality, is still happening in the real world, it still gives us a sense of what really Nazi occupation looked and felt like, In TGE there is instead there is no tension, no sense of vulnerability, no fear for your life from the part of the POWs. You feel like watching the youthful shenanigans of a bunch of teens in summer camp who, if caught will get just a slap in the wrist. See for ex. that after Tilts physically attacks two guards armed with automatic guns he is just let go scot free, he is not even reprimanded! After that scene you can't possible take TGE seriously. And what about guard Warner, who is smart enough to immediately discover the concealed tunnel but not enough to put the obvious two plus two together, that Hendley was the one who stole his wallet?. But the unrealistic reaches new heights with that Fourth of July parade. The German would have never ever allowed such a thing. No military in the world would ever allow their POWs such kind of display, let alone the Germans, who knew well how dangerous the mix of beer and flag waving could be. All that is pure Hollywood mythology. And to make things even worse, we got Steve McQueen, who every time he is on the screen, no matter what he does, say, he seems to be flaunting his star ratings. Not for a moment he makes you feel you are watching a real POW there, a man that feels impotent because deprived of his freedom, totally vulnerable to the whims and moods of his captors, but instead he gives you all along the feeling that Steve McQueen is all that there is to watch there and the rest is secondary. He feels all along so sure of himself that he can even engage in a staring contest with a SS heavy, a guy who could turn him into dust with a gesture of his little finger. But of course he knows he can do that, after all he is making thousands times more dough for this flick than the other guy, and than everyone else. He is the star here and he will never let them forget it, neither you, the spectator. In all, not worth watching, except for his fans. 3/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>'Hilts' "The Cooler King"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This not a review as much. I have read two books and watched a PBS Documentary on "The Great Escape". My focus is on Steve McQueen's portrayal of 'Hilt' "The Cooler King". The 1st book I read on this wonderful story was a little known accurate account biography written by Colonel Jerry Sage titled "SAGE". It is by all accounts the factual story of Col. Sage that McQueen portrayed as Capt. Hilt in the film. For dramatics the motorcycle jump of that barbed wire fence never happened but hey, that's Hollywood. I am privileged to know the niece of the late Col. Sage. The 2nd book was the popular Paul Brickhill tale. The PBS documentary of the "GREAT ESCAPE" blew me away. At the filming there were I believe 3 surviving men and when they found the actual tunnels after days of digging two of the items found were the bellows they manufactured for oxygen and get this, the belt buckle of one of surviving witnesses. I hope to locate this film again. Thank you Pvt Wm. J. E. U.S.M.C. Ret.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Epic escape movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is based on real life story . For dramatic purposes some things were changed , yet it isn't a complete fiction . The movie manages to be both entertainment and a honest tribute to the real-life prisoners.The cast includes stars like Steve McQueen , James Gardner , Charles Bronson , Richard Attenbourgh and James Coburn. No Oscar worthy performances here , but more than solid team work makes it a pleasure to watch . Each character has got it's own personality and is memorable. The dialogues are full with sly sense of humor ("There's a madness in this method" , "I'm watching him. I'm a lifeguard") . The whole movie is full of gentle and effective humor ( for example McQueen and stolen keys , McQueen and potatoes) . The screenplay is good , with believable and clever solutions to problems of prisoners (What to do with the sand ? ) .This movie is a war comedy , yet it has a heart. The movie becomes more and more serious the closer the end . Unlike most of today's Hollywood movies the drama here is connected with the comedy completely naturally."The Great escape" isn't a depressing drama , but it never forgets about the humanity of it's heroes . There is fear , loss and paranoia here too. There are two really heartbreaking scenes here ? the motorbike chase and the sacrifice of one of the prisoners . In the end the movie asks important question ? was it worth it ? It REALLY depends on your point of view.A true classic. Epic in it's length (2 hours 42 minutes) , yet never boring . Satisfying both as entertaining comedy and drama. I give it 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>POWerful escapism</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Little did I realise when seeing this classic film on its first broadcast on UK BBC1 on 28th December 1971 that it would be re-shown on UK TV regularly (including tonight), indeed almost incessantly for the next 4 decades and that one day I'd feel I'd know it off by heart. But that's now the case, proving familiarity doesn't always breed contempt. It's one film I don't need to record as it's either always available somewhere and well inside my head anyway.Dozens of problem Allied prisoners are collected together by the Nazis in a Super POW camp, all their rotten eggs in one basket. Richard Attenborough playing the Big Head, sorry, Big X is determined to worry and confound the enemy by organising the escape of 250 POW's and causing a second front to be opened up within Germany looking for them all. Based on a true story the biggest niggle is only slight: the deliberate inclusion of a couple of dynamic American POW's in the film ? but thankfully they were because the film would not have been seen by so many people if not. But, ultimately I'm not a POW camp expert any more than I can spot characters wearing the wrong socks or riding the wrong motorbikes ? this is just wonderful entertainment. Steve McQueen plays a wild card USAAF Captain, a fabulous character from whom he could never subsequently Escape. The first half sets the scenes and characters, and organises everything with humour, the second half is gripping adventure to a memorable end/s.It's long but an awful lot happens to justify the length - personally I could cope with a six hour directors cut at the same pace! The film isn't faultless but every corny bit or stereotype is completely forgivable and essential to fully appreciating it. All in all, probably the best POW film ever made, maybe even one of the best films ever made.</fullReview>

These men(played memorably by Steve McQueen, Charles Bronson, James Garner, James Donald, Richard Attenborough, Donald Pleasance, James Coburn, among others) are all escape artists, and the Nazis think that, by putting them "all in one basket", that they will be easier to keep an eye on...a mistake, since they instead dig three big tunnels called Tom, Dick, and Harry, to embark on a great mass escape.A classic of its kind, moves at a fast pace(despite being long, it never feels that way) and is highly involving as a story and in its characters.

		<shortDescription>The Great Escape is one of the all-time great movies.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on a true story from WW2 "The Great Escape" is in just about everyone's list of favourite movies. Taken purely as escapist entertainment (if you will pardon an obvious pun), it is a very tough act to follow &amp; the decision taken by its producers to fill it chock full of top-of-the-range film stars certainly paid off in spades. Steve McQueen will always be remembered for his iconic motor-cycle stunt-riding later in the film but there were many other memorable moments in the film. Trying to pick holes in this movie is churlish but I found it difficult to buy that Charles Bronson (tunnel king Danny) could suffer a serious attack of claustrophobia during the actual escape, even though i do understand it was done for dramatic effect. Genial James Garner (scrounger) always seemed to enhance anything he was ever involved in &amp; was, as ever, great. Same goes for Richard Attenborough (big "x" the organiser), James Coburn (manufacturer), David McCallum (soil dispersal) &amp; Donald Pleasance (forger). German actor Hannes Messemer was also great in his role as Von Luger the camp commandant. I must have seen this film at least 20 or 30 times (probably more than any other) but I still love it. Mention should be made, also, of Elmer Bernstein's iconic theme music which was used for England's World Cup campaign by football fans but I cannot remember which one, (maybe 1998).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Great way to Escape reality and live in prisoner of war camp</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Great Escape is a fantastic film that I have seen many times and love more each time I watch it, from the very start you can tell that what you are watching is something special as it is based on a true story and that is what makes this so amazing.The idea that an escape can happen as it does in the film astounds me and makes me realise how much stronger people during WWII had to be... if I was put in a camp and asked to escape I would have no idea how and would never think of digging three tunnels, I would be screwed because the younger generation is bought up not having to know things like this, everything is given to us and after watching the film I always wish I had had a tougher upbringing.The film itself is obviously the most iconic World War II film of all time, and since its realise there have been many films that use the same idea for example Escape To Victory and the TV show Prison Break, both of these are fantastic but do not live up to the epicness of the original, I honestly believe that the Steve McQueen motorbike chase scenes is one of the best made scenes of this type that has and probably will ever be made.All of the performances are great and the famous music fits the ideas of the film perfectly; but as I have said its the fact that the events are real that makes this film great.I would like to dedicate this review to those fifty who died as even though they were killed in a disgusting fashion and should have survived they will always be remembered as people watch this fantastic film.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Greatest World War II P.O.W. Movie Since "Stalag 17!"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director John Sturges had been struggling for eleven years to produce a movie based on Paul Brickhill's non-fiction bestseller "The Great Escape" (1949), an autobiographical account of one of the largest Allied prisoner of war break out attempts in World War II. An Australian Royal Air Force pilot, who had been incarcerated in Stalag Luft III, Brickhill documented the escape of 250 British POWs to tie up German troops behind the lines. The plan involved the digging of three tunnels far beneath the ground to avoid sound detection from microphones buried in the earth. The POWs considered every angle of this massive enterprise. Tailors converted uniforms into civilian clothing. Forges duplicated passes, permits, identity cards. Not only did the tunnels have to be excavated, but the POWs also had to dispose of the soil without arousing the suspicions. Brickhill participated in the two-year long escape plan and served as the man in charge of the security stooges who shielded the forgers from the German security guards that acted as 'ferrets' trying to flush out escape attempts. British South African pilot Roger Bushnel, head of the escape committee, envisaged taking out 250, but only 76 managed to getaway before the Germans discovered them. Eventually, only three escaped, while the Germans recovered another 23 men. The Gestapo captured the remaining fifty and Adolph Hitler ordered them executed by firing squad. The problem that Sturges encountered when he pitched the idea to various producers, among them Samuel Goldwyn, was the ironic narrative. "What the hell kind of escape is this?" Goldwyn hated The Great Escape, "Nobody gets away!" Louis B. Mayer refused to make it owing to the conspicuous absence of women. Oscar winning epics, like "Stalag 17" (1953) and "The Bridge on the River Kwai" (1957) had not altered the attitudes of studio executives about tragic endings. Meanwhile, John Sturges soldiered on and made westerns, crime films, and soap operas for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and Paramount Pictures until the early 1960s. Competition with television as well as the 1948 Supreme Court mandate that studios liquidate their theater chains because the moguls had been operating in restraint of trade, contributed to the erosion of traditional studio system. Independent producers came into their own and wielded greater clout for getting offbeat films made. Producers Harold, Marvin, and Walter Mirish had been toiling assiduously at Allied Artists to produce A-quality pictures, but their efforts had borne little fruit. At the time, United Artists changed the way Hollywood conducted business. Mary Pickford, Douglas Fairbanks, Charles Chaplin, and D.W. Griffith had formed the studio in the 1919. United Artists owned no studio back lots. Instead, the company distributed films. Since United Artists had no product to distribute in the early 1950s, the studio had been losing money on its global distribution network. Pickford and Chaplin agreed to let a firm of entertainment attorneys run the company. Meanwhile, the Mirish Brothers had been courting prominent directors who wanted to make pictures of their own choosing. The Mirish Brothers approached United Artists executives and engineered an independent deal to provide UA with a slate of films that they would produce, but the studio would bankroll. Mirish co-produced "The Magnificent Seven" (1960) with director John Sturges, and the incredible overseas success of the film enabled Sturges to convince Mirish to purchase the rights to Brickhill's novel and produce the film."The Great Escape" marked the zenith of John Sturges' career as a director and made an international star out of Steve McQueen. McQueen's motorcycle stunts make the last half-hour of the movie. No, he didn't make the big jump. "The Great Escape" bristles with action, excitement, humor, tension, patriotism, suspense, and tragedy. Most of the action is based on fact, but Sturges had to take some liberties. McQueen's motorcycle scenes were added as well the Americans. The Germans had moved the Americans out of the camp by the time of the escape.Elmer Bernstein's awesome music underlines every key moment in this epic length story.Ironically, despite its military narrative, "The Great Escape" emerged as the most anti-authoritative big studio film of the day, foreshadowing movies such as Cool Hand Luke (1967), The Dirty Dozen (1967), and Easy Rider (1969). Walter Mirish remembered The Great Escape as one of his favorites. He applauded the message of the film. No matter how impossible the odds, defiant men proved with their wits and will that nothing can stop them from accomplishing a goal. The engineering feats in constructing tunnels, effecting escapes, and tying up German soldiers made "The Great Escape" the apex of World War II POW movies. Furthermore, "The Great Escape" condemned the barbarism of the Gestapo for murdering the fifty POW escapees and hammered home the necessity for destroying the Third Reich.</fullReview>

But lest you think my fondness for this movie rests only on its associations in my mind and not on its quality, I have seen it since and it holds up remarkably well.Who can forget the iconic image of Steve McQueen taking off across that field on his motorcycle? We can look back now and see that that image served as an announcement of a new and radical shakeup taking place in film and popular culture, and that the next decade or so would be ruled by the renegade and the bad boy. "Easy Rider," "Bonnie and Clyde," "The Graduate," "The Wild Bunch" would all come later. "The Great Escape" came first.Grade: A</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to be honest the great escape is my favourite movie. It has a good plot but with a tragic ending and despite what people say is based upon a true story. What makes The Great Escape such a good film is humour of the men as they try to escape and the constant belief that they would eventually be free. This movie is a prime example of the undying spirit of human beings, even when facing the worst. Although some of the acting can be a little bit ropey and whenever I hear the theme tune I can't help but be reminded of it being chanted on the terraces of stadiums, I would say that the great escape is well worth watching. Steve McQueen gives a classic performance as Hilts which sometimes overshadows the performances of the other actors. Charles Bronsen and Donald Pleasence give a touching insight of the problems that they face while trying to escape and the death of Donald Pleasence's character brings a tear to the eye.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Strange feelings about this film...read on...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>How can a film that I first of all never saw until yesterday, that I laughed at in the first 45 minutes because of inconsistent, unrealistic and blatant comedy and scenes, be a classic that by the end of it all...I absolutely was in love with?? This film has some magical powers and one of those powers is an ensemble cast that when spoke about really gets the short end of the stick. Steve McQueen is always hailed as the story and his name is always attached to this film and yet he isn't the star. He's a big part of it sure and his name was the big attraction back in 1963 but what makes The Great Escape is the incredible ensemble cast that each play their vitally important role and create these memorable classic characters. The problem with The Great Escape is first and foremost...it's not really a Great Escape. Fifty Men are shot and killed, and what like one man finally escapes and possibly not even him?? 250 Escape (although it looks more like 50 TOPS when the Escape finally happens,) and all of them are recaptured and the film ends where it begins. It seems so anti climatic. On top of that is this truly a truthful look at a German POW Camp in Germany?? These men arrive at the camp looking Healthy, vibrant, strong, clean cut, and professional to a place that is better than Summer Camps that I went to. Gardening?? Baseball?? Cooking?? Drawing Classes?? Ummm...yeah...I admit I was never in a German POW Camp but I'm regretting it now having seen these wonderful conditions. Yes I know it can be argued that one man is shot trying to escape and later on the Gestapo murders 50 escapees but their time in the camp prior to this is pretty nice. The Germans practically hand them the tools and time they need to prep for escape even after knowing that the men are going to attempt escape they are hardly guarded, never looked in on and are allowed everywhere within the camp and left alone frequently. It's absurd!! So all this being said why am I thinking about the film right now and how incredible it was and how it's now one of my favorites?? MAGIC!! The film a cold hard classic and it just embodies, action, comedy, real characters that are brought to live with some great performance.Let's talk about Mr. Steve McQueen since he is commonly considering the star. We rarely see him for about the first hour of the film. His role as Capt. Hilts "The Cooler King" is good but small in comparison to some of the others. McQueen is strong and a little bit sarcastic and kind of funny in some roles and he appears to be a great leading man along the same lines as Kevin Costner or even Clint Eastwood...his characters don't change much and yet he is vibrant on screen. One of my truly favorite performances is by James Garner who plays Lt. Hendley. Hendley is a lead of sorts and people come to him to get things...any thing. Hendley comes across as trustworthy, determined, and a real hero of sorts. He's a great character!! Garner is terrific!! The terrific Richard Attenborough is the actual leader of the Escape Squadron Leader Roger Bartlett. Although I don't think Bartlett as a character is particularly likable he does a good job of organizing the team. Attenborough is a strong leader and ups the ante of the cast. Terrific in his role is Donald Pleasence who plays the very suave and likable Colin Blythe. His and James Garner's characters have unusual but very good chemistry together as they share a room together. A truly great performance is given often badly rated actor Charles Bronson who plays quiet and emotional Danny Velinski, who despite his title of Tunnel King is petrified of enclosed spaces. An aspect only made known far into the film. Despite that fact that it probably should have been established early on his performance because it's quite a credible and powerful performance. I have seen many, many Bronson films and this is one of his best!! Together this crew and the others I did not mention but still play great roles if not slightly smaller meld together and create a riveting story of friendship and team work to escape this camp although I'm not sure why they'd want to. McQueen's character who is usually labeled as the star forces his way into different scenes and the actors who portray the other scenes are good enough to hold their own but McQueen was "the star." I still must insist on the rather unbelievable aspects of this being a WW2 film but even still the tension, suspense, story and comedy just draws you in. The famous and well shot motorcycle scenes with McQueen do certainly add for some great action but also do feel a little forced giving McQueen scenes to show off in. Truly what makes The Great Escape a classic can barely be explained in a review or in words at all. The Great Escape is a film that just stands the test of time, endears itself to you and is captivating to watch and I do stand by that the incredible cast and interesting characters are a huge part of that. If you haven't seen this movie you must because it's cinematic history. A huge film with an even bigger following!! 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cooler King Cool Beyond Belief</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A great story about teammanship and courage, this is a movie about a prison escape that does not use the kind of violence it might when the real story seems to be a common plan for flawed but brave men to achieve one goal. The characters are defined in such an intriguing way....McQueen for his cool, slow planning, James Garner for his clever skills at finding ANY supply, Charles Bronson for his fear of the closed in tunnel when the time came for escape, and each quality of each man who was part of the planning and execution of the escape plan. McQueen is exciting to watch here, because of everything he is NOT doing. When he IS moving, the stunts on the motorcycles are infectiously fun to watch for those who admire sheer physical agility and absolute passion for speed. It is the underdog we root for, the great cunning plan to escape that we want so much to work. And even when it does not go quite as planned, there is still the Cooler King, dreaming up another plan.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>THE GREAT ESCAPE ***** If ever there was a movie where the viewer roots for the heroic characters to victory, it would be 'The Great Escape'. Memorably created based on the true event, it's setting is in Germany at a concentration camp during the Second World War, where Allied soldiers are held and monitored very carefully by The Nazis. The story begins with the captive soldiers grouping together to carry out a plan of escape - that is, 'The Great Escape'. The tactics involved are engineered by three of the soldiers: the Master of Intelligence (Richard Attenborough) and assistants Steve McQuinn and James Garner. They build an underground tunnel that travels past the vicinity of the camp, and even though some of the heroes escape, what the viewer discovers is that fleeing from the prison is one thing, but evading all of the German soldiers throughout the country from which point is another thing! While the introduction contributes comic humor, the second and third act features excellent suspense. This is a definite renown classic with a winning ensemble cast, solid scripting, good score from Elmer Bernstein, and particularly memorable supporting appearances by Donald Pleasance and Angus Lennie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Many similarities with a movie called The Password is Courage</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Last night I saw a black and white British movie, on TCM, made I think in 1961,called The Password is Courage. It was the "true" story of a Sgt Major Coward(!), played by Dirk Bogarde, and it too much like The Great Escape to avoid comment. Right down to the bellows in the hole, the cave-in, the fake passports and uniforms made from combed blankets, and the little bags of dirt in everyone's pants, the "Courage" movie would seem to have been among the "inspirations" for the McQueen version. My comment is not meant to denigrate The Great Escape in any way; please consider these lines to be a bit of trivia about the movie, which I hope will enrich everyone's experience in watching it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This wonderful star-studded war film is one of the best of the genre. With Steve McQueen (on brilliant form), James Garner, Richard Attenborough, James Coburn, Donald Pleasence and the late Charles Bronson this film is an absolute gem from the 60s. Based on the true story of a bunch of soldiers who are prisoners of war in the notorious POW camp Stalag Luft III, but the Gerries have underestimated their prisoners who like to give the Germans the run about by planning and staging miraculous escapes, but none are the same as the one they embark on in this camp, in which they attempt to get 250 prisoners out, it is unbelievably tense and the dialogue, amazing score, great directing and use of scenery, and of course the marvellous acting all add to create a mix that ends up in one hell of a film. Watch out for the cooler scene, which is so famous nowadays that it is copied by everyone under the sun, from The Simpsons to Chicken Run. But unlike these shows this film tells the ultimate story and is one that will make anyone all smiley in the finish.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Slight spoilersI thought The Great Escape was an excellent movie, it stars Steve McQueen as Captain Hilts later seen in Bullitt. (1968) It's just as great as Bullitt, and Steve did all but one of his stunt shots. And Richard Attenbourough as Squadron Leader "Big X" Bartlett. (later seen in Jurassic Park (1993)This films starts out with the POW's being moved to the camp, this also introduces the music by Elmer Bernstein. While it's excellent music it gets repetitive when they play it throughout the movie. During the first day a handful of the POW's try to escape early but all are found when a guard pokes around in a truck loaded with pine trees. I found it amusing that they tried to escape during the first 20 minutes. Captain Hilts and some other of his POW cronies begin an escape plan, dig their way out of the camp through tile, concrete, and dirt and recover it with a furnace. Some days later when they have the trench built underground they start moving people out. Captain Hilts gets to the top first and ties a rope from the underground to the forest. This is a blind spot for the Germans so it's perfect if they're careful. Most of the planners get out and run through the forest, but a man slips on the grass when he gets out and makes a loud thud. A German comes over and looks around, they find the tunnel and get everyone out. Less than ten get out so they make it for the Swiss border. A couple steal a German plane, one steals a bike, Hilts steals a motorcycle, and so on. In the end one by one is caught but a few make it out, and what about Hilts? He is pursued by the Germans and gets to the Swiss border, then he hits the top of the hill and what happens? Well you might know but go see it for yourself. This movie is great, I love the action in the small town where Big X keeps on slipping away but is finally caught around a corner catching his breath. Some say this movie is overrated, I think not it deserves great praise. I do agree that the motorcycle jump is overrated, I was like, that's it? Nonetheless, go see it, you'll like it probably, and if you do go see Bullitt also.9.0/10.0</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It Is Our Duty As Officers To Escape</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Great Escape is a carefully and crisply directed movie from John Sturges.*******************MILD SPOILERS AHEAD********************************Prisoners of war during World War II who have been causing the Nazi's trouble by repeated attempts to escape find themselves thrown together in one special detention camp. The philosophy the prisoners live by is that it is their duty as officers to try to escape in order to detract the enemy from fighting the war and divert as much of the enemy's resources as possible. Some of the prisoners of war are from various Allied countries and they work together on a bold undertaking of building an underground tunnel in order for 250 men to escape all at one time.The movie sets in the detention camp incorporate marvelous period detail and the movie locations include some lustrous views of the European countryside. The Great Escape's musical score by Elmer Bernstein is fantastic.The movie is interesting to watch throughout its 172 minutes and shows near genius by the director's strong and suspenseful finish. The performances of Richard Attenborough, Charles Bronson and Donald Pleasance are particularly memorable. In my humble opinion, the performances of Steve McQueen and James Garner were OK but not as strong nor as realistic as the film deserved. Steve McQueen's reported insistence on being the hero of the film by having his character's part rewritten to be the hero marred the realism of the film a bit. All in all, the Great Escape is a great World War II movie. I give it 90.5/100. It's one of the better World War II movies made. Twelve O'Clock High with Gregory Peck, however, has it beat as my favorite World War II movie with Guadalcanal Diary not far behind. </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Engrossing, well-acted, saga of the human spirit</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Great Escape" is an engrossing, well-acted, and fairly accurate portrayal of the famous escape of some 76 Allied POWs from a German Stalag during World War II. You get to see the intricate detail of the escape operation--and you also get to witness its bittersweet aftermath.Good, often understated, ensemble acting by what was for the 1960's an all-star cast, adds further to the sense of realism. In particular, Donald Pleasance poignantly plays a POW who gives his all to make the mass escape succeed, but then realizes he can't go himself because he's going blind.But "The Great Escape" is more than just an exciting adventure story. It also reminds us of several important things about the human condition: Human beings need to be free, as much as they need food and water. And they will struggle against enormous odds to gain their freedom. But freedom never comes cheap. The Allied POWs succeed in breaking out of the Stalag and dashing across Germany, in hopes of reaching a neutral country. But, as it turns out, at a very high price.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Something not often noted</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film may have its detractors, but I am not one of them. I saw it first in 1963 when I was a graduate student in Germany. What stood out then in everyone's mind was that it was absolutely true to its time and location. The German actors were indeed German, and not all of them were portrayed unsympathetically. Anyone traveling through Germany at that time would see many sections of the larger cities that remained in ruins. Yet there was evident a popular feeling that the country had largely been reborn and had rejoined the mainstream of European life and culture, as had Italy and other formerly fascist states.Films made shortly after (say, 1948 to 1965) and about about World War II in Europe, whether they were entirely fictional or based on fragments of fact -- as was this one -- seem always to have been either very good or very bad at portraying history within their own internal contexts. This one belongs among the former, together with "The Third Man " "Battleground," "The Devil Makes Three," and -- yes -- "The Sound of Music." The contrast with truly awful stuff like the television comedy "Hogan's Heroes" or action pix like "Guns of Navarone" or tendentious stuff like "The Night Porter" is sharp and painful to anyone sensitive to broader historical truths.Comments on artistic value and style aside, great movies based on recent history are in part great because they reflect those truths. More fanciful images that distort reality may be chic, but I tend not to value them very highly.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Great Escape" is one of those classic movies that parents seem to have a tough time getting their kids to sit down and watch it with them. Now, with that in mind, I am a 16-year-old male. I first saw this movie about three years ago when my mother managed to sit me down and have me watch it, and I LOVE this movie! There's really nothing bad you can say about this movie. It starts off a little slow, but before you know it, you become very intrigued in the story. And before the process of the escape even began, I became very interested in the characters themselves. Bronson's character, for example, probably received most of my sympathy throughout the film, because of his claustrophobia. This movie did a excellent job of forcing the audience to become involved in the characters before the initial escape even began. And when that moment came, I was just as interested then as I was in the beginning of the movie. Great action sequences, too, even for an older movie. And, as far as the acting goes, there were good performances all around (even by Charles Bronson!). If you haven't seen this movie, I HIGHLY recommend it! And, if you have kids in their teens, have them sit down and enjoy it with you. Hey, that's what happened in my situation, and I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. 10/10!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wouldn't have given a review if I hadn't read a certain review from one of the previous reviewers. It's funny that the certain reviewer described "The Great Escape" as an example of Hollywood fluff and then recommends "Saving Private Ryan". I don't want to say anything bad about 'Saving Private Ryan' because I consider it a masterful, realistic piece of modern cinema but it does suffer from perhaps the cheesiest dialogue ever for a modern film. Unnecessary Speeches and unintentionally comical moments (such as several 'helmet' scenes in the middle of the 'Invasion' sequence) prevents 'Saving Private Ryan' from becoming a timeless classic. "The Great Escape", which was released in 1963 may seem dated by today's and future standards but is nevertheless a joy to watch and definitely has a proper sense of dread for a war film. We must realize that a movie, whether based on real life or fiction, should be entertaining. If some uninvolving facts have to be altered for entertainment, then it has be done just as long as what is important is put to use (In this movie's case, the hope that one day they will escape). If a movie doesn't entertain, does it have much of an impact?The characters' involvement with each other is remarkable considering how many of them are there. From the ways prisoners deal with each other, to the German Military and the Gestapo, it was an amazing feat for the cast and crew. This a "Great" movie and a remarkable achievement in editing, screenwriting and directing.On that note, I have to say that I enjoyed this movie thoroughly, for it showed me a positive way to look at life and entertained me the way that no other war film ever has.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Great Escape" is a combination of great acting, actors, directing, Great Music, and of course the great action sequences. The director John Sturges employed great film techniques. The overall escape spanned over a year I think in real life. However, since this is only a movie length movie, it has successfully captured that whole time without any noticeable gaps. The movie is in color which was somewhat uncommon before 1963, so that is a bonus.The elaborate set of the P.O.W camp was exemplary. The director did not hesitate to confine the camera views, he tried to capture as much as possible of the camp at times, taking full advantage of the expansive set.The action sequences were well done. The motorbike scenes well very good. Quick takes of different shots, used a lot of wide shots to capture the surroundings. The music was extremely entertaining. The opening theme and internal music is one of the best I've ever heard. Especially during the action sequences, changes to suit the different people escaping. One of the good things about this movie is because it doesn't have a happy ending. Not all of the POW's escape, which coincides with reality as this is a true story with some Hollywood additions to spice the movie up. The location of shooting in Europe was very good and added to the aesthetics of the film.The on-going Cooler King, Steve McQueen added the most humor into the film, making it not so serious. Speaking of McQueen I have to mention the stunts. Excellent motorbike stunts. Another bit of humor was the try-hard Australian and some classic lines in the film.If there is anything to criticize in the actual shooting of the film is that there were some noticable continuity errors from different shots. For the actual movie, It is much better to see it on DVD as it is very much considerably cleaned up as far as picture and sound quality are concerned.I can't find anything in the actual plot or story to criticize, but there must be something. I rate it 9.5/10 Just Absolutely Fantastic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent cast in rousing WWII film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Great Escape is definitely one of my favorite movies. I remember seeing it at the drive-in when I was about 6. My parents always brought me a blanket so I could sleep in the back seat, but I stayed up for this one. The cast is excellent, with many memorable characters. Steve McQueen is at his peak, along with James Garner and Richard Attenborough. Based on a true story, a group of POWs from many allied nations plan a daring tunnel escape from a German camp. We see them plan, prepare, and dig the tunnels (3) as they elude detection from their captors. I have only one issue; the conditions of the camp are presented as a little too pristine, not dirty or squalid as in other POW movies like Stalag 17 or Von Ryan's Express. The prisoners here are always well fed and well groomed, with cleaned and pressed uniforms. But that can be overlooked because overall, the movie is excellent. The actual escape is filled with suspense, and the last hour of the movie we see them on the run, by plane, train, on foot, and in McQueen's case, by motorcycle. By this time, we are rooting for each character as they all try to make it out of Germany. All in all, a WW2 epic.</fullReview>

I decided then that it would become one of my all time favorite motion pictures.I must admit, however, that it does get a little boring on rare occurrences, but this is hidden underneath the excellent story that is being told to the viewer.This movie was powerful, electrifying, and had me on the edge of my seat.

		<shortDescription>Sturges, McQueen and Co. at their best.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This Film should stir the passions of those that have an affinity with War Movies, with it's telling of the struggle for life and, freedom in one of Germany's P.O.W. Camps in the Second World War. It's not factually correct, some items in Paul Brickhill's book which the film was adapted from were ignored or glossed over, and other events in the Movie which had little to do with actual happenings in the Compound were added by Hollywood, and it's mandatory penchant to entertain. Who cares!! The Great Escape is a great Movie, superbly directed by John Sturges who also skillfully gleaned the best out of the many Stars he had around him at the time and on the payroll. Certainly he was responsible in helping Steve McQueen perform one of his best screen roles as Captain Virgil Hilts, the gung-ho Airman delighting in upsetting his captors who took their work far too seriously, continually asking the mischievous one to spend time in their Cooler. Sturges manages also to capture the many nationalistic traits of the men in the Prison, showing us the stiff upper lip of the British chaps, the laconic Aussie, played brilliantly by James Coburn, the smooth talking American scrounger played by James Garner,the fierce independence of one of the tunnel diggers Danny Velinski, played by Charles Bronson and, of course the Camp Kommandant, Von Luger, ( Hannes Messemer ) expressing typical German efficiency but, perhaps wishing like his prisoners he'd rather be somewhere else. Elmer Bernstein's music also played it's part in making the Movie the success it is, with different mood and tone attached to pivotal scenes such as the opening sequences, the building of the tunnels and eventual escape, and the final stages of the show when we see the lucky ones on their home run. The Great Escape......is a great experience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Exciting, well-acted prisoner-of-war epic is a treat for movie fans.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Great Escape" stands out as one of the greatest war films. It would be inaccurate to characterize it as a prisoner-of-war film. It doesn't compare to "Stalag 17" in its depiction of barracks life in the prison camps. For one thing, "The Great Escape" was filmed in glorious technicolor with the Alps and forests of Germany as a backdrop. Much of the film occurs outside. "Stalag 17", by contrast, is filmed in gritty black and white with the mud of a German winter in the background. Virtually the entire film occurs indoors. For a realistic portrayal of what life in a German prison camp might have been like watch "Stalag 17"."The Great Escape" is primarily an action film. The prison camp is merely a launching point for the movie's action, which features a tunnel cave-in, furious chases through picturesque German villages, leaps from a speeding train and a plane crash. Steve McQueen's stunt riding on a bicycle provides some of the greatest moments in any film and is every bit as exciting as the famous car chase in his film "Bullit".The international cast does a grand job of acting. The characterizations are rich. The viewer cannot help but identify with these characters. The character of "Big X" played by Richard Attenborough is complex. He reminds me of a prize fighter who has had one fight to many. In this case he has been in the ring with the Gestapo, and it shows. Hendley played by James Garner is the scrounger. He is the person the prisoners go to when they need travel documents, a camera or tunnel digging tools. He is a cynic. At the end of the film he asks "Was it worth it?" There is plenty of suspense in this film. Which ones will escape? You pick your favorites and hope they make it. Some do. Some don't. There is disappointment when Steve McQueen's motorcycle wipes out within a few feet of the Swiss border and freedom. There is a feeling of elation when James Coburn's guide appears and points at the mountains in the distance with the one word line "Espana". Light moments are few in this film. The Fourth of July celebration complete with prison camp moonshine is an initial success, but disaster intrudes on the fun. The guards find one of the tunnels, and a prisoner is shot while trying to escape.The film has a very human quality to it. The prisoners have very human faults. The obsession of "Big X" with getting back at the Germans for torturing him is an example. Charles Bronson's character is a genius at building tunnels but is a claustrophobic.The Germans are not depicted as uniformly evil. The prison camp commandant (played by Hannes Messemer) is a compassionate man. He is quite a contrast to Otto Preminger's commandant in "Stalag 17". Robert Graf's character, "Werner, the Ferret", is a mixed up but generally sincere and kind person. He and Garner share a few moments of friendship in the film. It is Garner who violates the code to lift Werner's wallet to provide the documents that the prisoners need. The Gestapo is portrayed as evil and sadistic. In the film's early moments one of their men threatens "X" that "if you fall into our hands again, you will not be so lucky." Later, he makes good on that threat.This is a memorable film that works on many levels. Few war films have had such a blend of great acting, beautiful scenery and exciting action. Interestingly, there is little of the graphic violence and blood that accompany most war films. The violence is subtle. When the 50 prisoners are executed at the end of the film only the machine gun and an empty truck are shown. It is all too clear what has happened.Watch this film and "Stalag 17" as a pair. They provide interesting comparative approaches to the grim realities of prison camp life. Both are unforgettable films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best concentration camp parody ever with "Stalag 17".</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1953, the Academy award winner for best actor was William Holden in "Stalag 17" which was the story of a German concentration camp for Americans and was made to look ridiculous. In 1963, the best actor Oscar went to Sidney Poitiers for "Lilies of the field" and this is totally all right by me. However, I came to notice that "The great escape" didn't get any nominations either for acting, directing, or even best picture. And this movie is ranked #81 on our IMDb voting list whereas the 1963 winner for best picture, "Tom Jones", isn't even there. Maybe "Tom Jones" deserved the best picture that year, but "The great escape" should definitely have had at least a nomination. Captain Virgil Hilts (Steve McQueen) winds up in a German prison camp where he doesn't know anyone. But there isn't only him in that camp. A few days after he arrives at the camp, a well-known English Captain, Bartlett (Richarrd Attenborough), arrives as well and decides to take matters into his own hands by preparing escape plans for at least 250 of the prisoners in the camp. Naturally, a job like this one requires a lot of help. So he gets Hendley "The Scrounger" (James Garner), Danny Velinski "Tunnel King" (Charles Bronson), Colin Blythe "The Forger" (Donald Pleasance), and Sedgwick "Manufacturer" (James Coburn) to team up with him to make this one the biggest escape from a concentration camp ever. This one has to be THE great escape. At first, Hilts declines Bartlett's proposition to join his group claiming that he is going to escape much earlier than the rest of the group. But after he screws up and is sent to "The cooler", he decides to join up with Bartlett as soon as he is released from "The cooler" and when he does, the Germans begin wishing these men never entered this concentration camp in their whole life. But even though these men are pros at this kind of work, the Germans are able to find out about a few of their plans but to keep myself from spoiling anything, I won't tell you anymore about the movie itself. Director John Sturges has indeed directed some very god movies including the great "The magnificent seven", but he truly outdid himself in "The great escape". The movie offers suspense, action, and some good laughs as well and keeps you wondering what will happen to the main characters until you do see what does happen. Steve McQueen gives one of his best performances and Attenborough is excellent as well. Some of the best scenes of the movie are when you see the Americans preparing their escape and all the work and trouble they have to go through to get it done. It's definitely the greatest escape I've ever seen.</fullReview>

And, if you can't get enough, then I also recommend Jean Renoir's French film, The Grand Illusion, which is similar, but not nearly as good as The Great Escape. After seeing The Great Escape, you'll want to run out and rent anything that stars Steve McQueen. And you will never forget this movie--I promise.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great film, but read the book too...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Great Escape is one of the great action films of all time. The rousing martial score by Elmer Bernstein, the perfect cast of stars and stalwart supporting actors, the literate script by James Clavell, the taut direction by John Sturges... it all works together to create a seamless cinematic experience. However, it's well worth considering the realities underlying the fiction, because they can only deepen our appreciation for both. Some aspects of the film that seem improbable are easily explained; other aspects that are glossed over in the film reveal surprising additional depths.1. First, as others have pointed out, the details of the prisoners' shenanigans and of the escape -- especially the most unbelievable ones -- are absolutely true. German POW camps, largely as a result of the Geneva Convention, were a sort of world apart, with rules slanted surprisingly in favor of the prisoners. Many of their most outrageous escapades are actually omitted in the film.2. Subtly missing on screen is a sense of what camp life was really like on a day to day basis. There's no room in this fast-paced film to represent the dreadful tedium of years spent in the same wooden shack, on short rations. Years with no hope of parole, since the prisoners didn't know, as we now do, when the war might end. This helps explain their nigh-suicidal devotion to escape; these were men of action, cooped up endlessly with absolutely nothing else to do but plot to outwit their jailors.3. Also missing is a clear image of relations between prisoners and guards. By March, 1944, the Germans were living on very tight rations -- boiled potatoes and cabbage sort of stuff. Whereas the prisoners, while not exactly fat and happy, were receiving Red Cross goodies that no one in Germany had even dared dream about for years. This is hinted at, in the bribery that James Garner is able to conduct. But the dispirited state of mind of the Germans is not shown in any depth. According to multiple accounts, many guards were all too happy to collaborate with the prisoners, based on sheer economic pressure.4. On the other hand, it's not made clear just what the prisoners were up against. It's easy to get the impression that this was some sort of Hogan's Heroes resort, with the Germans oblivious to obvious conspiracies. Hardly! The 'ferrets' were guards who had the free run of the camp. They could literally pop in on any prisoner activity, at any time, any place. We see this happening once or twice in the film, but the implications aren't fully suggested. These were men with zero privacy; everything they did was subject to continuous scrutiny.5. The most obvious distortion, of course, is inclusion of Americans as major players in the escape. This was mainly a British camp and the Great Escape is fundamentally a British story. In fact, Richard Attenborough's character is the only one readily identifiable as a real person -- the amazing Roger Bushell. There's no point getting hung up on this bit of creative license; Sturges and Clavell have done a brilliant job of streamlining the story and spicing it up with star power. But in appreciating this film, we should realize which is reality and which is clever fiction.6. Finally, a word on the retribution meted out by the Germans. Yes, their treatment of the recaptured escapees was an atrocity. In fact, not mentioned in the film, it's been alleged that the order came directly from Hitler himself. On the other hand, what is not mentioned is that prior to the Great Escape prisoners had been repeatedly warned that breakouts were no longer going to be treated leniently. This is an important point. It makes the prisoners' actions even more heroic -- and also makes the Germans' apparent over-reaction more understandable (if not forgivable).What's more, even within the logic of the film, it has to be understood that these POWs really did cross the line from escapee to spy. Big X specifically says that his purpose is to set up a whole "second front." By intent, therefore, this is not a mere escape; it's a calculated attempt to disrupt the German war machine, conducted by men out of uniform. That's more or less the dictionary definition of espionage, for which summary execution has long been the standard remedy. (Steve McQueen flashes his officer's bars at the end, emphasizing the point. It's a moment that I didn't understand at all the first few times I saw the film.)None of this in any way excuses the insane brutality of war -- but it does make the events depicted in this great film somewhat more comprehensible. History is more fascinating than fiction exactly because of its greater depth. The upshot being that anyone who's enjoyed the film really should seek out the book by Paul Brickhill. Not to mention other books covering the same story, such as Alan Burgess' excellent The Longest Tunnel. There's a lot more to this true story than can fit in any one film, even one as beautifully constructed as The Great Escape.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Great Escape" is indeed a classic that delivers all of the key parts of an amazing movie; that is, a strong, developing cast of varied characters, strong moments of suspense, and unpredictable turns in the plot. After watching the movie, it suddenly hit me that there were no female actors at all, which only strengthens the fact that this classic succeeded in giving a supreme plot without relying on strong sexual scenes (or violence for the matter) like so many of today's films do. The film also delivers some very excellent views at the antagonists of the story, which in turn strengthen the overall view of the main characters. Steve McQueen is brilliantly funny and remains the King of Cool (or "King of the Cooler" in this case!), and as always, I found myself cheering for James Coburn. If you have not yet seen this amazing piece of work, tune in to AMC or visit your local movie rental store, because it is a late night classic that you will never let out of your mind.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best WWII film ever!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was a junior in high school when this movie was first shown on television. My dad, a WWII vet, urged me to sit down with him and watch it. But being a girl, and much too cool to watch movies with my father, I declined and spent the evening doing "important" things of which I have no memory. Several years later, I saw it in college on the big screen and adored it. What a great story! And it made me proud to be an American, thinking of all those brave men who sacrificed so much for something they knew would probably not work, but which might help the war effort just a bit. It is the kind of sacrifice that my generation just didn't "get" and now that I am older have the utmost respect for. The generation that fought that war is truly the great generation of the 20th century. And one of my biggest regrets ever is that I did not watch it that night with my dad. It would have been a great bonding experience and maybe I would have gotten even more out of it watching it with someone who was actually in that war. I am about to show this film to my critical viewing class and I hope it effects them in the same way. This is a story that needs to be in the minds and hearts of our young people.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shortest 3 Hour Movie Ever Made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>_The Great Escape_ is one of those rare gems of a movie - that when you're channel surfing and happen upon it - you just stop and watch it. What is it that makes this movie so appealing, particularly to men? First, each character is extremely well-developed. The director takes extra care to make sure we understand each of their roles and motivations. Second, the interplay of the characters is so well done, that even though we know it's just a movie, we're hanging on to every word. But the real reason why this movie appeals so much to men, is that it shows male friendship in the most powerful way possible - against the backdrop of life and death in a German POW camp.For example, consider the relationship between Hendley (the Scrounger) and Blythe (the Forger). This interplay could have been left out of the movie, but we would have lost what these characters cared about. Instead, we see these men, caught in a desperate situation, helping each other. In particular, Garner, goes out of his way to secure Blythe's freedom, and the payoff comes by showing Garner's face when his friend is killed. The sheer horror on his face is completely transferred to the viewer - and the emotion we feel here is heavy, indeed.Also, consider the scene where Bartlett (Attenborough) and MacDonald (Gordon Jackson) are boarding the train, and are discovered by the Gestapo. The trick used by the Gestapo ("Good luck.") is the very same trick MacDonald warned his men to watch out for. This is a very tense moment in the film, and suddenly, their cover is blown and a chase ensues. Masterfully done.Finally, there's Virgil Hilts (Steve McQueen). While his role was mostly a fictional creation, McQueen's personality embodies the eternal human spirit. We get this message in several ways. McQueen does not wear an army/air-force uniform - instead he wears jeans and a sweatshirt - visually not fitting into the military at all. Second, we cannot help but sense his desire to get out of there as soon as possible. He's not waiting around for the big escape plan. And third, there's the trademark Steve McQueen smirk, particularly evident when confronted by Col von Luger during his first escape attempt, and later, when he's caught in the barbed wire at the end. That smirk tells you everything you need to know about his character. If you watch closely, when Hilts is placed in the cooler for the last time, we see the same German guard locking him up as before. Hilts starts his usual baseball routine, and the guard, sensing Hilt's unstoppable rebel nature for the very first time, simply shakes his head as he walks away. It's just a little detail most people miss - but for those who catch it, it's kind of an "a-ha" moment for the audience.If you've never seen this movie, you owe it to yourself to give it a viewing. If you have seen it, watch it again, and study how the director uses friendship throughout the film to make an emotional connection with his audience. Great film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This has to be one of the greatest movies I've even seen. I think my family and friends can vouch for numerous times I've watched it.We can thank the movie "The Magnificent Seven" for the "Great Escape" being made. Director John Sturges originally tried to get MGM's backing in 1953, but was turned town due to demise of over half the escapees. It wasn't until he achieved great success with the magnificent seven, that he won over the Mirisch Company and United Artist to do such a film and make it so entertaining and not deviating from the details of the escape.Steve McQueen and James Garner are a pleasure to watch, and It's amazing how the writers were able to fit McQueens into the film.I'd recommend it to everyone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Greatest Movie Of All TIme</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Great Escape in my opinion is the greatest war movie that i have ever seen. Although i may not be a veteran of the silver screen, i have enjoyed this film each and every time i watch it. Based on a book by Paul Brickhall about the true exploits of Allied troops in World War II, the film is set in a German Prison Camp which had been built with the sole purpose of holding Allied prisoners who just would not stay captured. The Nazis, in bringing all these prisoners in the same place, assembled the greatest escape minds the Brits and Yanks could ever have produced.The ensuing actions never fails to entertain with roaming landscapes and an excellent score by Elmer Bernstein all add up to an beautifully directed movie by John Sturges, of Magnificent Seven Fame, with an unbeatable cast at the height of there powers with McQueen, Attenborough, Garner, Bronson, Coburn and many, many more.I hope my comments help you in your decision. Did I mention it won the Golden Globe for Best Motion picture in 1964?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The finest fact based WWII movie made.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I found the movie to be superb. The acting of the entire cast was first rate. Steve McQueen showed the reason He was considered the hottest actor of the 60's. Charles Bronson, David McCallum.James Coburn,and James Garner, all showed their considerable acting skills.The movie was faithful to the actual events. It captured the intense frustration of all POWs.I have seen the movie 7 times.The cast members who portrayed the Germans also did a fantastic job Hannes Messmer, who played Von Luger,the Kommandant, was quite good as professional soldier disgusted by some of his comrades.Angus Lennie,as Ives,delivered a touching performance of a man pushed to the breaking point by his captivity. All in all, The Great Escape is a movie to be seen by anyone who likes a good war movie.I highly recommend it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Great Escape is so good I actually watched it four times in one week! The way they did everything was really clever and I congratulate the movie producers and actors. I'd love to hear the stories of anyone who was in there so if anyone can help I'd love to hear from you! It would be brilliant!My favourite scene was when Roger Bartlett and Mac and Ashley-Pitt walked into the cabin on the night of the escape and everyone watched them and I imagine were grateful and in awe of the heroes. That was emotional and inspiring. And when Steve McQueen did his bike stunts, it was just amazing!The men who did those things were without a doubt courageous. Thank you for reading. See you!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kick-ass escape movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Accomplished cast in engrossing story of major break-out from German prison camp in World War II. Based on true-life story of Roger Bushell (Roger Bartlett in the movie), with some extra thrills and characters thrown in ala Hollywood. The book by Brickhill is as good as, if not better than, the movie; the book was followed by a sequel where Brickhill tried to track down the perpetrators of the post-escape massacre (some of whom, if I recall, had vanished behind the Iron Curtain). Ignore the comment above - this escape drew so many resources and caused so much disruption in Nazi Germany that Hitler personally ordered all the escapees shot, so "how many people completed their escape" misses the point. Relatively fast pace of film and thoroughly fine acting make up for long running time. Worth watching just for the scenes involving McQueen (reportedly a handful on the set), a real-life motorcyclist who performed his own stunts and some of the Germans' as an escapee with two wheels under him. A solid 10, deservedly in the IMDb top 100 with an exceptional Elmer Bernstein score.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In this movie, we have proof that it is very possible to make an excellent war movie without the gratuitous violence or language that is present in so many other WWII-set movies. Steve Mcqueen is unbelievably good as Hilts, and the script is written in a historically accurate way that puts other war movies to shame. Interestingly, another movie that I very much enjoyed starring Mcqueen, Papillon, has a very similar plot. Also, if you enjoyed the cast of The Great Escape, I would highly recommend The Magnificent Seven. It has absolutely nothing to do with WWII (it's a western), but, ironically, it has 6-8 of the same actors from The Great Escape playing major roles. Although Mcqueen is regretfully not present, this is another very well-acted movie.</fullReview>

I watch it with my dad a lot, and each time, I get the same feeling as if I'm watching it for the first time. It's hard to express how much I LOVE this movie. I especially like when they are trying the potato drink and they're all like "wow!". Steve McQueen and James Garner are amazing actors, and I've heard from people on this message board that they may be making a remake of this movie. PLEASE NO! A modern update would just ruin this movie. I like the fact that it DOESN'T have a whole lot of special effects, Steve did his own stunts (except one), and it would just ruin it because people would watch the movie, like young kids, and then they wouldn't watch the original, and think it was a modern movie. I'm such a sucker for old movies!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Great Escape is one of the best movies that has ever been made. The acting and character development is outstanding and is something that is hardly seen today. Modern movies are more about the action and special effects, something that The Great Escape has but not in aubundance. There is hardly, if any special effects, but there is a great action sequence with Steve Mcqueen. This is the famous motorcycle chase that is still considered one of the best in movie history. Over all this movie has some of everything but most of all it has great acting and a great story.p.s. I also read from someone that commented on this movie that it was not realistic. Well i read up on it and it is almost exactly how it really was, minus the motorcycle chase.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ultimate McQueen Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>All his previous films seem to have been simply prelude, leading up to the movie that let Steve McQueen portray the ultimate non-conformist and give audiences Hollywood's greatest chase sequence up to that time (along with his later 1968 car chase in Bullitt, it still stands as a milestone).I was a McQueen fan since his early days in Wanted: Dead or Alive. His character was unique, both in persona; a bounty hunter was/still is viewed with some disdain, but he turned Josh Randall into a moralist; and the gimmick hog leg Winchester he carried. Another viewer has already noted the unique series opening sequence with its initial camera zoom to McQueen's hip and the sawed off rifle, to his stride down the store front which ended with him ripping a wanted poster off the marshall's office bulletin board.As a kid, I had an avid interest in motorcycles and especially in military aviation, while most of my friends were into hot rods. So 'The Great Escape' was my kind of movie. Having McQueen play Hilts was the ultimate icing to the cake.But in 1963 McQueen had not yet reached the mega-star status he achieved after 'Bullitt' and his films of the 1970s so I was one of few people who followed his career closely. I was surprised then, when I met a very cute but shy girl in school who followed McQueen's career like other girls followed Elvis and the Beatles. She even had an autographed photo of him! We used to go see his films together at drive-ins and actually watch the entire movie!!! The Great Escape---great memories.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ever notice how these movies hold up except for the humor? McQueen as usual is just too hammy, every time he opens his mouth or mugs for the camera he kind of shoots the movie down, and it has to start building up all over again. This and various plot holes aside, the film is good and hard to "put down". The scenery shots flying around Germany and Switzerland are wonderful. But its far from perfect, I just found the stupidity of the Nazis in their ability to guard the prison camp too Col Klinkish. Amazing how once the prisoners escape, the Nazis then become this efficient crack bloodhound machine able to track them down through 3 countries. Coburn's Australian accent was nowhere to be found. Funny the Americans always play their WW2 roles for laughs and the indominatable spirit, against the usually sober more serious English characters who just want to get the job done already. Enjoyable as it is, I watched this expecting a war drama, and it didn't really deliver.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pranks</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Great Escape is one of those movies that personifies the dream of prisoners. Speaking as someone who spent a good deal of time in detention in high school, it is no wonder when I saw this as a junior that I latched onto it so quickly.The storytelling technique in itself is a flop because too many characters are represented, thus we aren't able to identify with them. John Sturges is a competent director, but some "serious" moments borderline comedy. Most of the actors were just too inexpressive (Bronson in particular) that they just became a large, faceless mass of accents. The Germans are presented in a fashion of stupidity, typical for a movie like this, and the guards' uniforms are an absolute riot to look at, tying with the stormtroopers in Star Wars for ridiculousness.You can argue about the morals and values of the POWs all you want, but when you boil it down, the Great Escape is all one giant prank pulled off by dozens of men to the dismay of their captors. It's that simple. Steve McQueen (in the days before Eastwood gave rise to the squinting anti-hero) epitomizes the attitude with his frequent shenanigans.It's interesting how many elements from this movie have been repeated by Steven Spielberg. Whether it's the initial unveiling of the fence (reminiscent of Jurassic Park) to the anti-climatic motorcycle chase (Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade). Elmer Bernstein's music is a swing of 60s tension and liveliness, similar to much of his work in Ghostbusters. He isn't Bernard Hermann, but I'm not complaining.Overall, The Great Escape is a movie that should only be seen from beginning to end. There isn't any suspense, most of it is predictable, and you may feel more than a little cheated at times. Nonetheless, between this and Cool Hand Luke, you should understand the whole 60s anti-hero genre very quickly. End of discussion. 3.5 out of 5 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Steve McQueen did an excellent job acting in "The Great Escape". The film is based on a true story about the Germans who opened Stalag Luft North, a maximum security prisoner-of-war camp, designed to hold even the craftiest escape artists in 1943. In doing so, however, the Nazis unwittingly assembled the greatest team in military history. My favorite scenes from this film are the 4th of July celebration, Steve McQueen riding on a motorcycle, and McQueen throwing the baseball against the cell wall.

		<fullReview>This is an excellent movie about World War 2 and a prime example of how a prison escape movie should be made. A fine ensemble cast of excellent actors, including Steve McQueen, James Garner, Richard Attenborough, Charles Bronson and James Coburn among others, who all do their bits unselfishly and with a cooperative spirit. Among these actors, Steve McQueen truly shines. Always cool, easy-going and optimistic, he embodies the heart and spirit of this action-packed movie. He brings not only great action (check out the motorcycle scene), but also a sense of levity to his scenes that are fun and entertaining. Masterful direction by John Sturges and a great musical score don't hurt either. John sturges and Steve McQueen had teamed up before in the excellent The Magnificent Seven, which also starred James Coburn. For those looking for pure entertainment, this movie delivers. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Is definitely a great adventure, hands down.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Inspired by a true story and based on Paul Brickhill's novel, John Sturges' "The Great Escape" is a great adventure, hands down. The tale begins as a mass of Allied P.O.W.s (hauled in trucks) arrive at a new camp that's run by the Germans and is solely described as "escape-proof". It doesn't take long for one prisoner, Virgil Hilts (the late Steve McQueen), who earns the nickname "The Cooler King" for his failed escape attempts. Hilts isn't the only prisoner who wants out, a few others hatch a plan to get 250 men out in one night. How its executed is a stroke of pure genius and skill. The movie has a vast variety of characters who are allowed to show their feelings, which is a nice touch. There two characters who make solid examples and I cared for the most. One is Colin Blythe (the late Donald Pleasence), a gentle Brit who specializes in forging names and goes blind. The other one in Danny Willinski (Charles Bronson), a Russian who excells in digging tunnels and tends to get rattled. The performances here are just perfect and the musical score by Elmer Bernstein is one of the best ones that I've heard. This movie would serve as a great history lesson for any student (middle or high).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The movie I have watched more times than any other</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As the other reviewers have suggested, one of the greatest movies ever made. As it does not need any further endorsement, I thought I might provide a few interesting sidelines.The book on which the movie is based, by the Australian author Paul Brickhill, is equally good. Brickhill is a writer who specialised in world war 2 true stories; he also wrote 'Reach for the Sky'(the story of Douglas Bader) and 'the Dambusters', both of which were also made into stirring films. Brickhill is a master story teller whose books rush on breathlessly and really do defy the reader to put them down.In the book, as was actually the case, American characters hardly figure at all; obviously the introduction of characters such as Steve McQueen's Hilts was intended to make the movie more palatable for US audiences. For once this tampering with the source does not at all prove a negative. This is obvious when you consider that easily the most memorable sequence in the film, McQueen's attempt to leap the barbed wire border on his motorbike, is the fruit of this invention.I think that the inclusion of James Coburns' character, Sedgewick, was made in acknowledgement of the author's nationality. Brickhill was an inmate himself at the prison camp where the great escape took place. Sedgewick is evidently an Australian, though you would never know from Coburn's egregious attempt at an Australian accent.Richard Attenborough's character, Bartlett, the big X or escape coordinator, is based on the Roger Bushell of the book. Why change the name from Bushell to Bartlett? Just a case of someone justifying their paycheck, perhaps.Additional dialogue for the movie was written by James Clavell, author of King Rat, Shogun etc. This is pure surmise, but I'm almost certain which scenes are his contributions: those where Bronson and Coburn attempt to escape with the Russian slave-labourers; when Wing Commander Day, asked by the commandant why he, an English gemtleman, is growing vegetables, not flowers ('you can't eat flowers'); and the one where the Americans distill some bootleg grog to celebrate American independence day.Finally an opinion on the music of Elmer Bernstein. It seems to me that it, like Mozart's, can be immediately atrributed to the composer, even on a first hearing, obviously without a suggestion that they are in any way repetitive. Consider the music for this movie, the Comancheros and the Magnificent Seven.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Great Escape is one of my all-time favorite movies. The cinematography, the story, the acting, the directing - all excellent. But it's Steve McQueen that takes it to another level and makes me want to watch it time and again. He's more than cool, he's the "cooler king". From bouncing the baseball in his cell to the edge-of-your-seat motorcycle stunts he steals the film every time he comes onscreen. The plot is based on a real life escape from a German POW camp in WWII and follows the group who hatched the plot from it's inception to it's aftermath. Other notable performances include Donald Pleasance and the even a passable role from James Garner. Not to mention Sir Richard Attenborough, Charlie Bronson etc - the list seems endless. How they afforded all these stars is beyond me, but I'm glad they forked over the cash.If you haven't seen this movie yet, put it on your short list.

Being involved in the film industry I was very excited back in 1995 as part of the VE day celebrations to give a special screening of The Great Escape at a Big Screen Cinema and have as a special guest speaker a former prisoner at Stalag Luft 111 in 1943 and involved in the actual escape plans, Mr Alan E. Bryatt. As a piece of entertainment he agreed that the film was excellent and in many ways quite accurate (although the actual escape took place in snowbound conditions!)

Colin "The Forger" Blythe (Donald Pleasance), action-ready Flight Lt. Bob Anthony "The Scrounger" Hendley (James Garner), flippant Flight Officer Louis "The Manufacturer" Sedgwick (James Coburn), Flight Lt.

		<shortDescription>A classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not a fan of watching old movies but the first time I saw this, I only caught the last 20 mins. It looked interesting enough and the next time it was on, I made a point of watching the entire thing and what a great movie this was. They don't make them like this anymore. This is a great story of survival. A group of POW's try to escape from a camp in Germany by building an underground tunnel opening just outside of the wooded area on the other side of the fence.As if the story wasn't good enough, this is one of the best ensemble casts I've ever seen. James Coburn, Charles Bronson, Steve McQueen, James Garner...and the list goes on. Not just a great ensemble cast but one full of actors that can really act. Interesting in the story is the respect shared by the German general and guards and the POW's.This is a great classic and a must watch for movie fans, even for those of us who weren't conceived when this was made.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An enjoyable and intelligent WW2 flick.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Considering that i am quite young (born 1985) i usually dislike these older movies even though they have great rating and comments etc, but somehow this has changed my opinion, actually i think it was quite good, well, actually very good and very enjoyable, i think this may be because it is not dependant on special effects at all, it's a straight out movie without any computer reliable stuff, which makes for a movie where i dont fint myself thinking "Damn that doesnt look to cool", which is nice.The movie itself is very entertaining, throughout almost 3 hours you can barely find a dull moment, which is fantastic, the movie is pretty fast paced all the way through, and it's enjoyable to see each character develop their personality and together as they work towards their goal. It is a well written story that holds your interest all the way through, and the acting is pretty nice too, something i usually dislike about older movies as well, but it works well here.Now one thing i can put thumps up to is the slightly untraditional ending, after they escaped rather early in the movie i had myself thinking how they would waste the final hour now, but they actually manage to throw in a few surprise, now without giving up the ending i must admit i think it was good that it didn't follow the typical happy ending where all slips away and lives happily ever after, the loss of some important characters combined with the survival of others makes for a nearly perfect ending, that is, as said, slighly untraditional. Also that is far more realistic than the typical Hollywood endings.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Great Escape: 8/10</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Young children will know it as Chicken Run, while older folk (like myself, at the ripe old age of 14) know it as The Great Escape, the classic POW escape film from 1963 with Steve McQueen and James Garner. With its familiar score by Elmer Bernstein, The Great Escape puts us into a German POW camp and we go along with everybody to try to escape in this three hour film.The smorgasbord of characters include Hilts, the `Cooler King' (McQueen), who spends much of his time in isolation, Hendley, the `Scrounger' (Garner), who can get anything he wants, and Danny, the `Tunnel King' (Charles Bronson). During WWII, these people are sent to the POW camp, and decide to escape by digging three tunnels under the camp, nicknamed Tom, Dick, and Harry. If one fails, then they move onto the next. Two hours are spent on this, and the third is spent on what happens to those who escape.Wait a minute! Did I just give away the ending? No, because of two reasons. One is the title: The Great Escape. It isn't called The Great Attempt to Escape. Also, the opening titles say how this is a true story, et cetera, so you know what basically happens. That doesn't mean, however, that it isn't a thrilling and enthralling piece of work. I wasn't exactly on the edge of my seat for the entire piece, but the 2 hours and 52 minutes flew by, and I didn't want to leave the film. I was engaged with everything this picture brought me: an interesting ensemble of characters (alas, like all ensemble movies like this, it's hard to keep track of EVERY character), an interesting and authentic (and I mean AUTHENTIC) set, and a certain air of unpredictability. I knew what was going to happen for some of it, but what happened overall and to each individual, I had no idea.There were some very good action scenes, also. Hilts, after he escapes, is evading German officers on a motorbike (possibly the most famous sequence of the film). He did most of the stunts himself. There was never a dull moment. The set looked very authentic, and it was shot on location. Although it's obvious how they shot it, it really looked like a tunnel under a POW camp. To sum everything up, The Great Escape is a very entertaining, three-hour classic that won't disappoint you.My rating: 8/10Not Rated</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Action-Packed Adventure From Start To Finish</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A fascinating account of a massive escape by Allied prisoners of war from a German prison camp during World War II. The audience is drawn into the story right from the beginning, as we learn that all the "rotten eggs" the Germans have captured (the prisoners who have made repeated escape attempts) are being moved together into one prison. Question: how will they manage to pull this off when, given the kind of prisoners they are, the Germans must be watching every move?Great performances, especially from Richard Attenborough as Bartlett ("Big X") who is in charge of the escape attempt, Steve McQueen as Hilts, who continually draws the wrath of his captors and is repeatedly sentenced to the cooler, and James Garner as Hendley, who scrounges the needed materials any way he can. The movie featured an interesting performance from Charles Bronson as the Polish prisoner Danny. I never quite understood Danny. He spent days on end underground helping to dig the tunnel, then was afraid to escape through it because he was claustrophobic? Did I miss something here? That one didn't make sense to me.The only fault I really found with the movie was the portrayal of life in a German prison camp. The whole thing just seemed too comfortable. I found it difficult to believe that the Nazis treated their prisoners as well as seemed to be the case here. True, the movie does infer that the camp Kommandant - Von Luger, played by Hannes Messemer - was not exactly a fanatical Nazi. I enjoyed the scene where the Gestapo and SS officers who visited him had to drag a rather half-hearted "Heil Hitler" from him. Still, conditions in this camp just seemed too good - almost a "Hogan's Heroes" vision of life in a German POW camp. That aside, this was an excellent movie, and I would give it an 8/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Great Escape is the best movie ever made. It's been so well put together, and i've heard that it's so close to the truth- that any closer and it would be classed as a documentary. The line up of actors who star in this movie are amazing. Firstly, Steve McQueen, who is in my opinion the finest actor to have ever walked the earth. (Just remember, any movie that stars Steve McQueen is a must see.) Although the entire cast were outstanding, Steve made the movie for me. He took a leaf out of his own past and brought it into the character (Captain Hilts), making the audience automatically feel a connection with Hilts. Richard Attenborough, James Garner, James Donald, Charles Bronson, James Coburn, Donald Pleasence, to name a few made the movie what it is-an unforgettable classic. For anybody who has not yet seen this movie- where have you been all these years. I'm only 18, the movie was made years before i was born and yet (living the world we have now) i find this 60s classic at the top of my list. Watch it, pay attention, it's amazing!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Inspirational filmmaking, but a bit boring from time to time.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This isn't the most exciting or suspenseful escape movie. I was actually a bit bored from time to time while sitting through this one. But I do have respect and appreciation for this ensemble piece that is based on a true story. And how it tried to stay true to what really went down. I was surprised though at how it goes in a more civilized and whimsical direction despite it being a P.O.W. film. Even the intro music is whimsical and is very iconic to the point that there has been a lot of parodies done with that music. The main reason I wanted to check this movie out was because it is on the favorite movies list from some of my favorite directors. I can however see how this movie inspired some of the other directors and how they borrowed certain ideas from this movie. Maybe it's because the director decided to take more of a upbeat approach to the story. Since the cinematography and camera-work seems to be done from a distance to get wider shots, which sort of takes away from the tension and excitement. But maybe it was to get all the characters in without leaving anyone out. The running time is actually quite long, almost hitting the three hours mark. So a better editing and tightening of the script would have made this film more effective in my opinion. This is a P.O.W. movie the whole family can sit through without it offending anyone. Although the kids will most definitely will get bored sitting through this one. Overall, this was a fresh take on this genre and I didn't mind sitting through it. It's a movie that gives ideas, but just isn't something I would want to re- watch immediately.7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Original Great Escape, Not Those Songs</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Great Escape is sure a lot of fun. I was unsure whether a film of this magnitude could pull off all these characters, but I can say it does an admirable job at that. All the characters also admirably show what a person will do in order to obtain freedom, all the while depicting their German captors in a not so unsympathetic light; there is still chivalry among the armies.As far as characters are concerned, Steve McQueen, James Garner, and Richard Attenborough really stand out as Allied captives. One minor character I enjoyed was the German soldier Werner, who has a funny interaction with Garner's character in the barracks.The last thirty minutes of The Great Escape dawdle a bit and come across as a bit of a footnote at first, until the viewer realizes the full scope and objective of the plan. Overall, there is a ton to like and this film is close enough to perfect to deserve a 4 out of 4 star rating.</fullReview>

He survived the Great Death March ordered by Hitler. I'm sure their confinement was much more difficult than this movie conveys. Just the same I'm grateful that this movie was made and has kept alive the amazing efforts of those who when they enlisted signed an agreement that they would do all they could to attempt an escape if captured. They have found several of the original tunnels and they invited all the still living original diggers/ escapees to return to view the findings and to fill in the gaps as to what the archeaologists had retrieved from the exposed tunnels. It's on "You Tube" I believe. These men have become WW II heroes in many eyes, mine included.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you've never seen a Steve McQueen movie before, this is a good one to start with. It was my first, and the only one I needed in order for me to be hooked. You somehow know it's going to be alright when he's on screen. Always ahead of his time with his colloquial demeanor, McQueen helps bridge the gap between old and new Hollywood, making the classics more accessible to younger audiences. But The Great Escape is entertaining even when McQueen isn't present. The 1963 classic mixes suspense and levity brilliantly as it follows a group of allied prisoners in a German camp attempting their biggest escape yet during World War II.The Great Escape is plot buildup at its finest. Writer-director, John Sturges, has an impeccable sense of narrative. From start to finish its tone never wavers. And even with its juggernaut of a runtime clocking in at nearly 3 hours, you're never checking your watch. Although in this day and age it helps to know the history--seeing as World War II was still fairly fresh in everyone's minds back in 1963. But setting aside, you can still appreciate the general storyline. Even a younger audience should be able to follow along easily and still enjoy this movie's timely humor. Elmer Bernstein's score helps to drive this film with strong motifs. It echoes The Bridge on the River Kwai, but has a feel all of its own.The Great Escape is a phenomenal film. It's consistent and thoroughly engaging, and the type of movie that just puts a smile on your face. With a little help from McQueen, it holds up very well. He's at his best here, like always. And the rest of the cast is so strong that this film is great even when he's absent--he's just the cherry on top.Twizard Rating: 100</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Loved this movie was action filled and exciting with the stunt work for the Steve McQueen chase scene was a classic. The movie is about a true escape from a POW camp during WW2. The movie was star studded and well done and I think the characters that I adored the most were the James Garner character and the Donald Pleasance characters as they just brought a humanity to the screen. I liked the fact that the movie was full of character and had a sense of hope in it as the prisoners tunnelled out yet if I did have a problem with the movies it was with the Richard Attenbrough character and his cohorts as the leaders. I found they did nothing in many regards while everyone else was working hard with the tunnel while their characters just did squat. I was not sad to see them shot but was saddened when Donald Pleasance character died and that is because they were unlikeable compared to the rest.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Great Escape is A Great Deal of Fun And - In Itself - A Kind Of Escape!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At a Luftwaffe-run high-security WWII prison camp somewhere in Germany, a group of Allied officers plot one of the most inordinately ambitious escape attempts ever hatched. Not just a dozen or two, but 250 men are planning to escape. Each man contributes his expertise. British Squadron leader Roger Bartlett (Richard Attenborough) nicknamed Big X designs the plan, which involves digging three tunnels at once with Charles Bronson as the "chief digger", despite his lifelong claustrophobia. James Coburn is the "manufacturer," who invents a way to keep air flowing through the tunnels. James Garner plays the "scrounger", whose job is to get a hold of things like picks and shovels as well as ID badges and documents. Donald Pleasance is a "forger" who prepares the fake documents the prisoners will need once they escape. Finally, we have Steve McQueen playing Hilts, who spends most of his time in the cooler, bouncing his baseball against the wall and is ready to go through the tunnel to get important information, and then allow himself to be recaptured so he can give them the information. With its luxurious three hours, The Great Escape deliberately details all the ins and outs, the successes and pitfalls of the plan. We learn how the diggers get rid of the excess dirt. We learn where the wood comes from to brace the tunnels. We see how the scrounger makes friends with - and double-crosses - the guards to get what he wants from the outside. The escape itself occurs in the middle of the film, and the way it is shot is absolutely gripping. The cast is a cavalcade of tough guys from 1960, offering a fantastic ensemble - a punchy cast with the moxy you'd expect from a group of officers trying to buck the system.Unlike other prison camp movies, it does not dwell on disputes between prisoners or on the deprivations, which seems almost comfortable. The story gives us an exceptional example of professionalism, courage, resourcefulness, teamwork, and loyalty of every one of the prisoners. But, it is not one bit preachy. It is in fact, an absurdly fun movie to watch: it says very little about the human condition but it doesn't ever sag for long enough to let you notice that fact. John Sturges' genius is that he presents each detail of the plan with all the excitement of a major set-piece: he understands the human tendency towards curiosity in how things work and rewards it by lingering over every step in the process. Elmer Bernstein's exemplary score helps a great deal. He lays on the dread when Sturges forgets about it, and ramps up the suspense when necessary with a rollicking, jingoistic collection of iconic marches and leitmotifs that give the film a bouncy momentum that carries us through.It is, when all is said and done, a mechanical film: but god, what a beautiful machine!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you have yet to sit down and watch this movie, I have to ask what are you waiting for? This has got some of the coolest acting around. Steve McQueen is one amazing actor and he gets to do his thing here. It is actually kind of hard to describe easily what Steve brings to this movie. Granted, he is a main character, but there are plenty of those running around in this film. Steve though, stands out above the fray, at least in my book, and you root for the guy to get through what he has to do to get by. But being in a German prison camp can't be easy. These actors are pretty good at getting that point across, in spades. Life is tough behind barbed wire with marksmen watching over every move your making, or at least they are trying too. Thankfully, the Germans are not always as attentive as they should be. Sit down in a comfy chair, put your seat belt on tight and hang on, especially once Steve gets some horsepower under his butt. The ending isn't really, 'cause the prisoners just are not going to quit trying to leave.</fullReview>

A fascinating work of art based upon an actual WW2 prisoner-of-war camp escape.This is a perfect movie from cast to director to location to sets to action to, to, to everything!Many of my movie heroes are in this movie - how many movies are made nowadays where there are more than one, two, or, even three superstars in the cast? This movie has at least eight(8) leading actors, as well as many more familiar cinematic faces, both American and European.This movie is also directed by WW2 veteran John Sturges who once made training films and documentaries for the USAAF. He directed other such classics as "The Old Man and the Sea" (1958); "The Magnificent Seven" (1960); and, "The Eagle Has Landed" (1976), just to name a few.I highly recommend that all war-movie buffs watch this. If at all possible, rent the DVD which includes behind-the-scenes footage about finding the right location for the movie, as well as a short documentary of the 'real' escape that this movie is based on.Highly recommended - a great movie of a great escape! :)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Very rarely do casting, script, soundtrack, editing, performance, cinematography and direction gel so sublimely. Re-visiting this for the sake of childhood nostalgia - Hilts motorbike slide into barbed wire and Christmas post-turkey trifle are forever entwined in my brain - I was struck afresh by the perfection of this film. The mix of derring-do and comedy takes on a shadow with Bartlett's arrival, and then goes a shade deeper with the death of Ives. By the time the men are machine-gunned down in an open field, the tonal shift has moved deftly to the other end of the spectrum. The making of moonshine, and the reaction of the brewers - three simple 'wows' - is a masterclass in economy in scripting. Ditto the rhythmic use of the baseball smacking against the wall in the cooler. And the score - once heard, never forgotten. Quite simply, this is arguably the greatest film ever made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the greatest escapes...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Great Escape" is an adventure movie which is based on true historical events during World War II and especially we watch a group of allied escape artist type prisoners of war (POW's) put in an 'escape proof' camp. There they will try to escape with all of their powers.I really liked this movie because it's a movie which is based on true historical events and of course the plot of this movie was excellent. If we think that this movie is based on the truth or most of it then we can understand how difficult was for those people to be prisoners and we can watch how hard the wanted to be free. We also watch them put all their effort to reach freedom with any cause. Steve McQueen was simply outstanding in this movie and I really liked his interpretation, also James Garner's interpretation who played as Hendley was equally good such Charles Bronson who played as Danny. I also have to say about the escape plan that was magnificent and really brilliant, and I believe with this the direction wanted to show us that these people had spend plenty of their living time on prison and they wanted to change it and be free again.Finally I have to say that "The Great Escape" is one of the best adventure movies with this plot (escape from a prison) and I believe that if you are a fan of adventurous movies then I am sure that you will love it. But also if you are not I believe that you are going to have a nice time as you watch it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is special, and not only because of the utterly catchy theme music, but because of the execution. Everything from the award nominated film editing, to the seamless cast and tension throughout the last hour, the film is a masterpiece. At first the music didn't seem to fit, but after while you realize the genius behind that classic tune. The actors are all perfect in their roles, and I particularly enjoyed Steve McQueen in the lead. It was my first taste of the Oscar nominated actor, and he couldn't have made a better impression.I really liked the links I saw to Shawkshank Redemption, which obviously was influenced by this classic WWII escape movie. From the moles they had, to the removing dirt/stone by shaking it out of their pants, you can easily tell the influence it has had. I also liked that while Steve McQueen is considered the lead by default, there really wasn't an actual screen time lead. There were roughly 8 actors who shared most of the screen time, and it was directed perfectly.But I would say the lack of a defining villain was the reason it wasn't a perfect film. For a movie that nears 3 hours, I would have liked to get to know the main bad guys of the camp more, which would have made the final escape even more thrilling. I didn't know the actual outcome, so it did surprise me who made it out and who didn't. The movie is quite a thrill for being over 50 years old and I highly recommend it for anyone who loves WWII stories, or just watching great acting.+Brilliant ensemble cast+Actual Thriller+Catchy main theme-Lack of a defining villain9.4/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Historically important, well made and well acted, The Great Escape is simply a film that must be seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'd heard lots of great things about The Great Escape, but had never got round to watching it until very recently. Having watched it, all I can say is that I wished I'd watched it years ago.The Great Escape is the true story of a mixture of American and English soldiers who are being held in a prisoner of war camp in Germany during World War 2. This film chronicles their escape from this POW camp. I went into watching this film with no prior knowledge of how the escape was orchestrated and that was the thing that really impressed me; the sheer ingenuity of the escape and how methodical and carefully planned everything was. Each man brings their own strengths to the table such as James Garner's character Scrounger who is the guy who can get anything for you (similar to Morgan Freeman in The Shawshank Redemption) and Donald Pleasance's character Blythe who is a 'master forger'. Truth be told, I would have enjoyed The Great Escape even if it was fictional, but the fact that this is a true story is a real testament to those men that were involved.Acting wise I'd probably single Attenborough and Pleasance out as being the best, but that's not to disparage anyone else as everyone was excellent. This is another example of a film that has humour, tension and at times it was also quite moving. History had already written the script for this film so it's down to the actors to bring the characters to life and with the strong cast that we've got in this film that was always going to be a 'done' deal.I only realised after I'd watched The Great Escape that there was a documentary on after it which depicted the real Great Escape. I only wished that I'd spotted it as I would have really liked to have watched it (particularly so after watching this excellent film).This is a film that I would recommend to everyone. I knew nothing of the history behind this film so I found it particularly clever and entertaining. If you haven't seen The Great Escape yet, don't make the same mistake that I made and wait years to watch it. It's an important part of history and a damn fine film as well!

		<fullReview>I consider the decade of 1960's and a few years on either side, the Golden Age of the epic World War II movies. This era gave us Bridge over the River Kwai, Patton, Tora Tora Tora, The Battle of the Bulge (say what you will). There were some great scores that came from these gems but the sound track of the Great Escape is the one that pops in my mind (and maybe this is just me) when I'm doing something that may be of epic proportions. I think one of the things that makes this era so great is that many of the actors and production people involved were WWII or military vets themselves. Period vehicles and locations were still around in good supply as well. As our greatest generation passes so does the greatest generation of the World War II movie. I ended up watching these movies usually on TV as a kid and if they were on a weeknight I didn't always get to see the end. I remember watching this most likely as a two parter of Saturday Night at the Movies. This was an NBC show that would feature first rate movies within a few years of their theatrical release. This was before the days of home video. It memory serves me correctly the first part came on Saturday night with the second part the following Monday night. On Monday night when they started the movie I was able to record the opening score with a very primitive tape recorder and I've been hooked ever since. This movie has to be seen to be believed. The star power put together for this movie is incredible. I've seen a documentary on this that puts the whole movie in an even more epic light. Steve McQueen's motorcycle chase is in my opinion one of the top five chases ever put to film. McQueen's chase in Bullitt is another one. But back to the sound track, some of the most memorable are of course the opening convoy scene,the McQueen chase (one day he's going to make it, I just know it) James Garner and Donald Pleasance in their airplane escape (very sad at the end) and James Coburn in the rowboat.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Escape? Great Movie. One for all time.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having seen this film as a young boy in the Martial Law era of 70s Philippines, I never realized the magnitude of the basis of the plot nor the stellar power of its cast. To me it was one of the few movies allowed by the government for showing over TV.Now that I've seen it again, over two decades later, I have come to grasp the craftsmanship of the film. Despite historical inaccuracies to allow for dramatic story-telling, it still holds up as a captivating escape flick.So what if the Steve McQueen character never really rode a motorbike? So what if they never showed the discovery of one of the other tunnels before the completion of the one finally used? So what if James Coburn turned in a horrible, non-existent Aussie accent? Still cool. Every living being who appreciates movies, history and story-telling should watch The Great Escape.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Truly Great Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Great Escape is undoubtedly the finest war/prison movie ever made. Directed by John Sturges,whose film credits include Bad Day at Black Rock (1955), Gunfight at the OK Corral (1957), The Magnificent Seven (1960) and Ice Station Zebra (1968). In World War II,Mr. Sturges made documentaries and training films while enlisted in the US Army Air Corps. His exhaustive research and attention to detail are certainly on display in this film. Because of his success with The Magnificent Seven,he was able to convince MGM to undertake this monumental project. After much negotiations, he was able to convince his star from The Magnificent Seven, Steve McQueen,to come aboard for this film. McQueen was reluctant to do another war movie, and only accepted the part if a motorcycle chase was wrote in exclusively for him. Sturges agreed, and the chase toward the end of the movie became one of the signature highlights of the film. A little known fact is that during the chase McQueen, through the magic of editing, was also used as one of the German motorcycle riders,thereby creating the unique circumstance of McQueen being pursued by himself during the chase scene! An all-star collection of American and British actors, McQueen as Hilts,the Cooler King, James Garner as the Scrounger,Richard Attenborough as Big X, Charles Bronson as the Tunnel King, James Coburn as the Manufacturer and Donald Pleasance as the Forger,to name a few.Thrown together in the German prison camp Stalag Luft III, the Air Force prisoners use their creative talents to dig three tunnels( Tom,Dick &amp; Harry) and get as many men out as quickly as possible, and to create as much confusion for the German SS as they can in trying to find and recapture them. Based on a true story, this film combines the components of suspense, ingenuity, adventure and the triumph of the human spirit to attain freedom no matter the cost. Screenwritten by James Clavell (Shogun) and W.R.Burnett (Little Caesar), a wonderful music score by Elmer Bernstein,beautiful scenic filming near Munich, Germany, this magnificent film captures all the elements of a timeless classic!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A likable ensemble in a desperate gamble</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of many fine ensemble war epics that appeared in the 1960s, "The Great Escape" stands apart for its exhilarating final act. After painstaking preparations in which each major character puts his particular escape- oriented skills to use, the prisoners encounter a hitch in their plan. The great escape then becomes a great race as the Germans pursue the former captives on trains, on city streets, in the air, and (in the case of Steve McQueen's character) on motorcycles. Charles Bronson, Richard Attenborough, and the rest of the ensemble are innately likable and sympathetic actors, and their relatability elevates the stakes and invites emotional investment from the viewer. The escape sequence is nail-biting but great fun to watch, as the characters we like so well confront their final, impossible barriers to freedom.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>an all-time great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some films never get old. A group of Allied POWs decide they will stage a mass escape from their camp. The objective is not so much personal freedom. More than that, they plan to continue their mission as soldiers by disrupting the German war effort, even if it turns out to be a suicide mission.Cue one of the best ensemble casts ever, with heavyweights of USA and UK cinema including Steve McQueen, James Garner, Richard Attenborough, Charles Bronson, Donald Pleasence, James Coburn James Coburn, David McCallum and Gordon Jackson all featured. Impressively, they don't all just appear but actually turn up, each character distinctive and expertly fleshed out by the actors plying their trade. Some of the escapees inevitably meet a grislier fate than others: people remember the comedy and the pathos, but there are quite cathartic moments here, too. The film also makes brave choices - Steve McQueen and Angus Lennie as a double act? I see a game of casting the remake is current. I hope it stays a game. Some films are timeless and defy comparison.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic Prison Camp Drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a boy, one of my favourite books was Pat Reid's "The Colditz Story" (my father owned a copy). Reid's classic wartime memoir tells the story of how he, and the other Allied prisoners of war held in Colditz, attempted to outwit their German captors and escape from captivity. I was enthralled not only by the courage of these men but also by their resourcefulness in plotting their escape attempts and in manufacturing or procuring all those items they would need- food, civilian clothing, forged papers, German money, etc. Resourceful though the men of Colditz were, they only ever attempted to break out of the camp in small groups of, at most, three or four. Paul Brickhill's "The Great Escape" tells the story of an even more audacious deed, the mass escape from Stalag Luft III in March 1944. War films were a staple of the cinema, both in America and Britain, during the fifties and sixties, and films about life in POW camps were a popular sub-genre; other examples include "The Colditz Story", "The Wooden Horse" (also based on an escape from Stalag Luft III) and "Danger Within" in which the villains are, unusually, Italian rather than German. Such films, at least those set in Europe, generally have a fairly light-hearted, patriotic tone, and usually end with the prisoners putting one over on the nasty Nazis by pulling off a daring escape. (POW films set in the Far East, such as "Bridge on the River Kwai" or "King Rat", are often darker in tone). This film tells a fictionalised version of the Stalag Luft III breakout. Names are changed, but some of the characters are based on real men; Richard Attenborough's character, for example, referred to as "Roger Bartlett", is based on the real-life Roger Bushell. The greatest change made is perhaps the introduction of a number of American characters; in real life no Americans participated in the escape- they had all been moved to a separate camp- but here no fewer than four big Hollywood stars- Steve McQueen, James Garner, Charles Bronson and James Coburn- were brought in. This was doubtless done for commercial reasons; unlike "The Colditz Story" or "The Wooden Horse" the film was made by an American company, and the days were long gone when American audiences would flock to see a film without any home-grown stars. Even the trick of casting American actors as Canadians to disguise their accents, as was done with Humphrey Bogart in "The African Queen" or Gregory Peck in "The Purple Plain", was starting to wear a bit thin by the sixties. Some critics tend to get very hot under the collar about what they see as Hollywood's attempts to claim the credit for the British war-effort, but I feel that in this case the distortion was justified. World War II was, after all, a joint enterprise, and the introduction of American stars highlights this theme of Allied co-operation against a common enemy. Moreover, had the film been made with an all-British cast we would have been deprived of one of McQueen's greatest performances as Captain Virgil Hilts, known as "The Cooler King" because of the amount of time he spends in the "cooler", or punishment cells. (This would later be inverted to produce McQueen's own nickname, "The King of Cool"). McQueen also provides the film's most iconic moment, namely his attempt to escape to Switzerland on a stolen motor-bike. There are too many other good contributions from the ensemble case to single them all out, but I should mention Attenborough as Bartlett, the organiser of the escape, and Donald Pleasence (himself a former POW) as Colin Blythe, the skilled forger whose intricate work by candlelight damages his eyesight.The first half of the film has a similar light-hearted tone to POW films like "The Colditz Story", as the prisoners set about the task of constructing their three escape tunnels and putting together their stocks of escape equipment under the noses of their captors. And then, about halfway through, the tone starts to darken. One of the tunnels is discovered by the Germans and a prisoner is shot dead during a breakout attempt. Undaunted, the prisoners press ahead with the planned "Great Escape". The original idea is for some 250 prisoners to break out of the camp through one of the remaining tunnels, and although the plan has to be aborted when the guards spot one prisoner leaving the tunnel, 76 men succeed in getting clear of the camp. The film then traces the progress of some of these men as they try to make their way to freedom across German-occupied Europe.We know, of course, that only a handful of the "Great Escapers" succeeded in making their way to neutral countries; the great majority of them were recaptured and many of them were shot on Hitler's express orders. The film does not shy away from recounting these tragic events, which makes it something of an exception to the normal conventions of the prisoner-of-war film. Yet this does not make it depressing. Despite its tragic ending, the film, which ends with the caption "This picture is dedicated to the fifty,"- a reference to the number of recaptured prisoners murdered by the Nazis- comes across as an inspiring tribute to the men involved in the "Great Escape", an impression strengthened by the jaunty, defiant march which forms the basis of the famous musical score. This is one of the classic prison camp films of all time- my favourite apart from "Bridge on the River Kwai". 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Exceptional Film About Teamwork</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Great Escape is based on the true story of a group of Allied prisoners of war who managed to escape from an allegedly impenetrable Nazi prison camp during World War II.It features Steve McQueen, James Garner, and Richard Attenborough together with James Donald,Charles Bronson,Donald Pleasence and James Coburn. The film is based on the book of the same title by Paul Brickhill, a non-fiction account of the mass escape from Stalag Luft III in Sagan in the province of Lower Silesia, Nazi Germany. The characters are composites of real men. It was produced and directed by John Sturges.The Nazis gather all their most devious and troublesome POWs and place them at a new prison camp, which was designed to be impervious to escapes. Immediately, the prisoners develop a scheme where they will leave the camp by building three separate escape tunnels.The British soldier who masterminds the whole plan, and who commands his motley squad that includes a Polish trench-digging expert,an American with a talent for theft, a masterful forger, and an American rebel through the construction of the tunnels and, eventually, their escape.A stirring example of courage and the indomitable human spirit, for many John Sturges's The Great Escape is both the definitive World War II drama and the nonpareil prison escape movie. Featuring an unequaled ensemble cast in a rivetingly authentic true-life scenario set to Elmer Bernstein's admirable music, this picture is both a template for subsequent action-adventure movies and one of the last glories of Golden Age Hollywood. Reunited with the director who made him a star in The Magnificent Seven,McQueen gives a career-defining performance as the laconic Hilts, the baseball-loving, motorbike-riding "Cooler King." The rest of the make the most of their meaty roles.This is an epic adventure film that runs nearly three hours that provides exciting action sequences which had never been seen before in Hollywood productions as it provides an exceptional story about teamwork.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Instant Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Great Escape is among one of my personal favourite films and something I will always consider to be a must watch for history buffs. This movie is topped off with a cast of stars who deliver nothing short of an amazing performance. I find myself drawn into the emotions of the characters every time I watch The Great Escape. From the start of the film, the audience is drawn in with the catchy theme song as we build an opening and develop our characters. As the film moves forward, the audience may find themselves drawn deeper into the characters, much as I have. The performances are so amazing, the actors alone make it a film worth checking out. Combined with the brilliant true story this film is based around, it becomes an instant classic. Although I feel this film is grossly underrated in todays media, it is a film that will always be a classic and something that anyone should watch if they have the chance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Masterclass Of A War Movie: Probably A "Boys Own" Tale</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Men like this film - I know - A (male) friend mentioned it to me and I found myself immediately singing "that theme tune" ... You know the one.Heck.. I'm a huge fan of Bronson and Richard Attenborough - Here, I think both men turn in some of their best performances. They don't have to work too hard - The script is well-paced, believable and engaging. A strong supporting cast does no harm either... It amounts to a roll-call of some of our finest European and American actors.If there are weaknesses in this movie, I'm hard-pressed to find any. You'll be glued to the screen as we're drawn into the strangely claustrophobic world of capable soldiers dealing with enforced incarceration.Each man is assigned a function and that function gives him something to live for. It's a deeply psychological piece, often moving and portrays the courageous spirit of men determined not to endure the fascist "jack boot".These Nazi camps really did exist and (at their worst) became the monstrosities of Auschwitz, Birkenau and the like. This film only hints at that... Since many escapees are (finally) executed in cold blood.But overall, I think, Great Escape is not about the Holocaust. It's about men who found ways to survive it. I think that's important and its a powerful message underpinning a fabulous film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great movie for the THE GREAT ESCAPE</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Great Escape... A great incident which may have shook the confidence of Nazi POW camps. The strangest thing about the escape was it was not exactly an escape but an attempt to distract the Germans from the front. Now when it comes to the movie, it is pretty obvious that it will not be same as the true incident. But the film adaptation was good. A balance between reality and entertainment was well maintained. The movie only shows what an average audience wants to see and feel i.e. entertainment rather than making him revolve around the minute details of the escape. So I would say it was more a movie less a documentary. I wouldn't say great but all the actors have done justice to their parts. It was really nice to see acting skills of a great film maker Richard Attenborough as the Master Mind of the plan. Steve McQueen as a notorious American prisoner who made several escape attempts did a good job. Charles Bronson was as usual calm and composed I doubted whether he would panic during the escape but yes did justice to his role as THE TUNNEL KING.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A faultless film in every department that still stands up today almost 50 years later. It is a film full of standout moments, none better than the beautifully realized motorbike chase sequence. This was apparently added to the film at the request (or demand) of Steve McQueen who wanted more screen time and has become one of the most iconic sequences in movie history. Of the many characterizations on screen and the production team there are two that stand out for me and lift the film from an entertaining war picture into a classic. First is the presence of Steve McQueen who oozes charisma in every scene. I cannot think of any other actor of any generation who could have been so credible in the motorbike sequences. Along with the chariot race in Ben Hur it ranks as one of the best action scenes of all time. Second is Elmer Bernsteins incredible score. People mostly remember the Main theme but like the very best film music it has a rich and varied score which takes the viewer on an emotional ride and gives the film it's sense of pace and exhilaration. Way ahead of it's time. Listen to James Horners' score for Titanic and you can hear the influences. John Sturges was an underrated director and like a lot of the great new directors of the sixties, such as John Frankenheimer and Franklin J Schaffner, the quality of his output fell dramatically towards the end of his career.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So I watched 1963's "The Great Escape", starring dead people who include Steve Mcqueen. So is this movie a classic, well I say yes. If you watch this movie you may find yourself saying ohh.. that's where that came from (in reference to any number of movies and TV shows that have paid homage to this movie including say the Simpsons). The whistled theme is just awesome something I have whistled since I was a kid. The movie is true to the original true story. It is very well acted. Exciting from beginning to end, and does not have a happy ending (which isn't necessarily a bad thing). Well why not because sometimes it is more about the journey in life than the destination, and the creative forces and sheer will of these men to escape from their German captors makes for great movie watching. I say see it young or old, male or female, this truly is a classic. if you like concise reviews of interesting films please read my other reviews at http://raouldukeatthemovies.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ten, for the Bravest of the Men who Died Escaping</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What makes this movie as one of the greatest epic movies was the true story, Steve Mcqueen,direction by Sturges and the stunt riding by Buddy Aikes (had a school for riding in San Fernando Valley) who was subbing for Mcqueen (Insurance would not allow Mcqueen to do the jump even though he was perfectly capable.) The same motorcycle was later ridden by Henry Winkler as Fonzi. "Shashank Redemption" was great escape movie but it was not during the war (courage of one man over many men) and it was based on Fiction. The fact this movie has stood the test of times because of the unsurpassed endurance, patriotism, ingenuity and positive spirit in the group of men for whom nothing was impossible. Even though this movie had no women (except in the train and public spaces) it was universally liked by men and women unlike other prison movies and all Nationalities. The only anti-climax is Hilts character played by Steve Mcqeen should have escaped (since 8 POW's did escape) since the saddest part was seeing him back in the "Cooler" (The Gestapo who shot the fifty men, were later hunted and killed by the British Intelligence and of course Germany lost the war.) I would love to see the 'Great Escape 2" by Judd Taylor.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am glad the previous reviewer wrote about the history of stalags and escapes to help straighten out some of the people that did not believe this really happened or some of it, it's like the Battle of the Bulge movie, it was based on history but it has many flaws, like the tanks in it, by the end of the war, there were not enough German Tanks left in running condition to make a movie, so they use what they have, but that does not mean the movie and what is in it, did not happen.I love the array of stars in this, it's just one of those films where everything seems to fit perfectly, the acting is top notch, the scenery is fantastic, and the things they added to the true story helped form it into an great picture.The musical score is an all time classic, and so is the film.You can't miss on this one, I showed it to my boys when they were young and we all watched it again in their teens and they have seen it themselves since, and it's a movie they have never forgotten and that I have heard them talk about when great movies are mentioned.Knowing it really happened just makes it that much better and that much more fun to watch, it has several sad parts to it, but that's history and they could not change that.All I can say is don't miss this one if you have not seen it, watch it at least once in your life, I could watch it anytime it's on TV or I occasionally put it in my DVD player an watch it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Like a lot of other reviewers I always like watching this film and look forward to seeing it because for me its like watching it for the first time. The whole look and feel of the film is unique not just because most of what takes place in the film actually happened but its that indefinable something which sets it apart from most other war films. Yes there is a cast list to grace any film creation and it is clear that a lot of attention was given to make it as 'authentic' as possible but there is something there which I can only describe as magical. It seems that in order for the American viewing public to pay and watch this film the nationality of some of the cast was changed but in my opinion the changes only add to the films atmosphere. What I find stunning is that it also seems that in the real life escape preparations 600 men were involved for well over a year. How secrecy was maintained by so many for so long leaves me in awe of the discipline and the planning which must have taken place inside a prison in a the middle of a war. Yes all in all this three hour film is impressive in every way and for the first time viewer please let me reiterate most of what takes place in this film actually happened. Once seen never forgotten is how I would describe this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There was a lot of characters. That usually makes things super-confusing for me. Most movies with a cast like this introduce characters and either kill them off shortly after, or leave them as minor footnotes.I was shocked at how successful the characters were done.The movie takes place at a P.O.W camp deep in Germany. It's a new high-security camp that's ran by the German Army/Luftwaffe. The warden of this camp is a very likable guy. He's really set on the idea of 'sitting out' the whole war and just housing/taking care of these men. The movie quickly points out that this guy isn't a huge fan of Hitler or the Nazi party. He sympathizes with his prisoners and is very good to them. The rules and inspections he enforces are only to maintain order. It becomes very apparent that he doesn't want the prisoners to escape for the only reason that he fears for their well-being. If the SS were to pick them up, who knows where they would end up.Upon entering this POW camp, for a allied serviceman, you are given a task depending on your set of skills. These tasks (or jobs) that you do are part of this never-ending escape machine. It's the duty of most of these guys to at least try and escape.There's a notable relationship between one of the scroungers (gets hard to get items into the camp) and a forger (creates false IDs for escaping P.O.Ws). The forger spends so much time looking through a magnifying glass that he ruins his vision. When the "Great Escape" is in it's final phases, he's told that he would endanger the operation if he wasn't able to see. The scrounger stands up for him, and offers to be his guide - regardless of how dangerous it could turn out.There's more examples I won't get into, but all of them are a great example of brotherly love and comradery.It was perfectly paced, and you actually gave a damn about the characters.Steve McQueen as "Hilt" is quite possibly the coolest/most suave character I've seen in a movie. I was cheering the whole time he was tearing ass through Germany on that motorcycle.The music was a bit stereotypical for an older WW2 movie. I'd like to see a more dramatic soundtrack. That's the same complaint I had with The Bridge On The River Kwai.Now that I think about it, these are very similar movies.I liked The Great Escape better."Great" flick. You won't have the desire to "Escape" your living room while this movie is playing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a terrific movie The Great Escape is ? and what a unique position it has captured in the hearts of the British public. Nearly half-a-century after it was made the TV stations still trot it out on at least one public holiday each year for us to enjoy and, even after numerous viewings, it's always a pleasure to watch. The near-three hour running time simply flies by, propelled by Bernstein's rousing score and a raft of memorable scenes that, it seems, will always remain in the public consciousness.I saw this on the big screen last night, and to see it in all its Panavision glory really is an experience that adds immeasurably to the enjoyment, even though it would have been nice to have seen a restored print. The story, of course, is timeless, even though some of the stiff-upper-lips unintentionally teeter on the brink of parody, and the film takes us from one memorable scene to another: Hiltz bouncing his baseball in the confines of his cell, the body of little Ives (Angus Lennie, whose performance is tempered somewhat by childhood memories of his later appearance as stroppy chef Shooie McPhee in Crossroads) hanging from the barbed wire fence; the doomed Blythe (Donald Pleasance) meticulously counting his steps from the door to the pin he has strategically placed on the floor in an attempt to fool his comrades that he isn't going blind; Cavendish falling through the beds from which Hiltz has removed the slats; Gordon Jackson's character falling for the same trick that he earlier berates a fellow comrade for doing; David McCallum's desperate dash down the train platform after killing a Gestapo officer. And of course Steve McQueen's iconic escape attempt at the Swiss border on a hijacked German motorbike? Terrific stuff.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I first saw TGE as an eight year old boy in the Bronx. Key was the very wide screen; the way this film should be viewed. Steve McQueen was larger than life on that motorcycle and certainly influenced many young men of the time. Motorcycle, haircut, sweatshirt or ball off the wall. To this then eight year old, Virgil Hilts was a hit and the center of the movie and the escape. Since that time I have seen the movie a half dozen times on television and recently on DVD. Post 1963 we had Steve and Attenborough together again in my favorite McQueen movie- The Sand Pebbles. I have seen all of Steve's later efforts and even went to the earlier POW film- Stalag 17.Looking at TGE as an adult I see the themes of duty, loyalty, friendship &amp; sacrifice. These to me are the takeaway and not the motorcycle action and the countryside, enjoyable as it is. James Garner's performance is perhaps under-appreciated and his relationship with The Forger/Donald Plesence is fascinating.I definitely recommend the movie and encourage viewers to look not just at McQueen's performance, but to the host of excellent performances by the above and everybody."Your German is quite good".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>War movie fans will be pleasantly surprised by this film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Most war movie fans enjoy being thrown into the fray with a rag tag company of men, thrust into the battle, experiencing the thrill of victory, and the pain of loss: of men, a battle, etc. But what will attack these fans to this film, is the perspective of the prisoner of war. In this case, the Allied prisoner of war. Where this film diverts from many, is in the comedic aspects of the film. Some, tongue in cheek situations, that keep the pace of the film from being too serious. A wonderful, and eclectic cast of characters comprise the film, and they all seem to work well together. There isn't that awkward pairing of actors that don't play well off each other, like so many of todays Hollywood output. You have accomplished foreign actors like Richard Attenborough, and Donald Pleasance, who lend a credibility to the film. And then you have some rather brash, unpolished, but extremely talents yanks, like Steve McQueen, James Garner, Charles Bronson, and James Coburn. They have a playful quality about them, they come across as the young braggarts, a bit loose with their approach, but a nice contrast to the stiff regimen of the British army. This film uses the escape, not so much as a central focus, but rather more like a centerpiece. A thing of beauty and and great effort, but something that will oftentimes get overlooked due to the playing out of the occasion. The performances here overshadow a quite riveting story (based upon a true life happening), about a daring escape plan hatched by the allied prisoners of a German P.O.W camp. They see themselves as contributing to the war effort by creating as much chaos and havoc as possible, naturally this will be brought about with an escape of a great number of prisoners, they plan on two hundred, and the subsequent search by the German army for the escapees behind enemy lines. A film with a great plot, excellent execution of story, and some of the finest acting performances seen of film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One Movie That Should NEVER be Remade!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>How could any movie maker even CONSIDER doing a remake of this all-time classic? It would be as great a travesty as some musical group thinking they could record a better version of "All Along the Watchtower" than Jimi Hendrix!! Just look at how awful the remake of Rollerball was! This is one of those movies that stands the test of time as it is, and just can't be outmatched. How could any present-day actor top the cool performance of Steve McQueen? Or match the intensity of Sir Richard Attenborough? Or the quiet desperation of Donald Pleasence, who actually WAS a POW? Or the cockiness of James Garner, who used his experience as a scrounger in Korea to make his performance more realistic? Or the ingenuity of David McCallum? Or the realism of Charles Bronson, who, with his Polish descent, makes his portrayal of a Polish, (NOT Russian), flier so true to life? Or match Angus Lennie's portrayal of a man being pushed over the edge of insanity by long confinement? Or match the combination of coolness, ingenuity, and frustration of James Coburn, who actually did a convincing Aussie accent. Pay attention to the scene where he shows Big X, (Attenborough), his ingenious air pump and air ducts. Watch his face when, right after Big X tells him "good job", he tells him to "Have it installed by tonight." That's great acting! Why can't Hollywood realize that we're getting fed up with an endless stream of remakes that just don't hold a candle to the originals? There are so many stories from WWII that haven't been brought to the big screen. *RANT* What's wrong with some of these people who complain that the conditions in the camp aren't realistic? WERE YOU THERE? It is a well documented fact that the Germans, especially the Luftwaffe, were very careful to follow the rules laid down by the Geneva Convention in their treatment of British, French, and American POWs. It's also a fact that Luftwaffe officers felt a kinship with other fliers that transcended wartime enmity. For instance, when Douglas Bader, (the man who was famous for flying with two prosthetic legs), was shot down and captured, he lost one of them bailing out. General Adolph Galland, who was in command of the fighter arm of the Luftwaffe, notified the British of his damaged leg and offered them safe passage to drop off a replacement. They also became friends after the war. (Read Reach for the Sky: The Story of Douglas Bader DSO, DFC. by Paul Brickhill and The First and the Last: Germany's Fighter Force in WWII by Adolph Galland) So the depiction of the treatment of the prisoners in the movie WAS accurate! To my knowledge, the ONLY Luftwaffe officer to be tried for war crimes was that fat fool Hermann Goring, and it wasn't for anything he did as commander of the Luftwaffe. Putting him in charge of the Luftwaffe had to be one of the biggest blunders Hitler committed! As for the guard's seeming ineptness, I guess you weren't paying attention when Big X told the POWs to set up a system of watchers to signal whenever a guard or a ferret got close enough to see or hear anything. Or to all the scenes showing all the diversions the prisoners used to distract the guards. It's also factual that the Germans allowed prisoners to keep their uniforms and badges of rank. This was intended to make escape more difficult, for one thing, and the Germans had enough problems with shortage of resources for another. *END OF RANT* All in all, watching this movie will be one of the most enjoyable 2 hours and 52 minutes you'll ever spend. There's just NO WAY anybody could ever do a better remake of it, and it would be as big a blunder as the one I mentioned above to even try! 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The true story of a big-scale escape from Stalag Luft III, a German prisoner-of-war camp, during World War II.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I do not consider this a war film. It is not a war film. It is an ESCAPE film. They are trying to ESCAPE from the war, along with other things they are also trying to ESCAPE from, such as the wire, the feel of endless isolation in confinement, the guards, not being able to see their families, their jobs in the "Big X" organization, etc. The reason that I said that they are trying to ESCAPE from their jobs in the "Big X" organization is because would you rather be doing your job in the "Big X" organization, or would you rather be at home with your family, in your own country? I would rather be at home with my family, in my own country. I like how the prisoners are always prepared for when the Germans come and the prisoners are working on their escape. As soon as they see the Germans coming their way, the prisoners sound their alarms, and BAM! they have put everything back to normal, and you could never have told they were planning an escape, unless you searched the place, which the Germans never seem to think of doing. Also, it works the same way when the Germans leave the room- BAM! they have their forged papers, or tools to work on the tunnel, or fake uniforms, out and working on them. AMAZINGLY PRECISE! It seems ironic to me that MacDonald(Intelligence), played by Gordon Jackson, warned another escapee that he had to watch himself with the language, he said this during the time for the preparation of the escape. But later, when MacDonald and Bartlett are boarding the bus, and the German officer says "Good Luck" in English, MacDonald says "Thank you" in English, also. Then MacDonald realizes the mistake that he made, and because of him, they both have to run, then they get caught, put in a truck, drive out to the country, and get shot down by murderous German officers. Ironic, isn't it? MacDonald warned somebody else about not making a mistake, and then he got caught because he made the very same mistake!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A super cast of high profile actors (or soon to be at the time) all arrayed in the same movie. Their egos do not collide but instead collude to inspire, depict and create one of the finest historically accurate films of all time. Suspenseful and exciting, this movie is similar in scope and powerful effect as "The Magnificent Seven" made three years earlier with some of the same cast members. A charismatic nostalgia envelops me whenever I view this film. It is a good feeling that takes me back to my youth and to what I perceive as "good times." The screenplay in this film is powerful and thoroughly rewarding. There is heartbreak at the end but there is also triumph displayed in the will of man to be free at all costs. "Give me liberty or give me death." Every actor is high profile and they live up to their reputations in each role as they "execute" them perfectly. A gripping film that leaves you on the edge of your seat as Steve McQueen adds heart-pounding excitement in his nearly successful escape attempt. Everyone and anyone can enjoy this film. Simple and basic but it works.This film is meant to be seen on the big screen - but it does not matter - just see it!</fullReview>

It's not merely a matter of production values, but that this is (as much as, for instance, "The Magnificent Seven'), a quintessence among the actors-driven movies.

Continuity mistakes happens one after another, and are painful for the viewer's eye, but what the heck! Taking good advantage of this cast, very rarely possible, John Sturges was wise enough to just sewing up a fair entertaining movie to the audiences all around, reality to hell!

He puts his people in such good positions and gives a lection in camera- and light- guidance: night and day. In practice, the air-force captives were brought to a camp at the Taunus mountains, so the distance for biker McQueen must have been far longer.You cannot avoid being bound to the captives and psychological pressure against freedom, you feel narrowed, too. So the movie does not let you free, thereby it is genius.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Expected A More Engaging Drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An adventurous, light-hearted story set in a Nazi POW camp during the Second World War, The Great Escape is a finely crafted, patiently narrated &amp; ably performed cinema that today is hailed as a classic example of its genre by viewers &amp; critics alike but all I found is a film that ends up running far too longer than it's supposed to.Inspired from a true incident, The Great Escape tells the story of the Allied prisoners of war who have been recaptured by the Nazi German forces &amp; are placed in a high-security POW camp where they together decide to plan a mass escape. But with jailers keeping a close watch, they have to be extra-careful so as to not give away any suspicions.Directed by John Sturges, the film marks my first stint with his works and also happens to be the first film starring Steve McQueen that I've seen. The story does have moments that impress in bits n pieces but it fails to justify its 165 minutes of runtime. Cinematography is pretty ordinary, Editing is nearly absent &amp; the soundtrack brings an adventurous vibe to it.Coming to the performances, the cast consists of Steve McQueen, James Garner, Richard Attenborough, Charles Bronson &amp; others, and it's actually their contribution that makes it a cinema worth sitting through. McQueen is definitely the coolest of the bunch, Attenborough also manages to leave a lasting impression, Garner has his moments to shine &amp; they all are nicely supported by the rest of the cast.On an overall scale, The Great Escape is neither a great cinema nor a bad one but considering its legacy, it did leave me disappointed, possibly due to my high expectations. The whole picture is filled with moments of action, adventure, comedy, drama &amp; suspense plus the thoroughly filmed escape sequence &amp; the following events are a delight to watch, yet I was hoping for a more engaging experience which it failed to deliver.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>All Hail the Cooler King!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Great Escape directed by John Sturges is about the real life escape by WWII Allied POWs from a German prison camp and lay chaos to all of Nazi Europe, but the film loosely close to the real life events. The film is more based on the novel of the same name by Paul Brickhill, which is a non-fiction account of the mass escape from Stalag Luft III, a new high-security prison in what's now modern day Poland. The characters in the film are composites of real men. Each of the characters brings something to the plot, and escape story-arch. Roger Bartlett DFC RAF, "Big X" (Richard Attenborough) is the brains of the operation. Richard brings a commanding role to the character, and gives him the cutting edge intelligent needed for such a task. He organized teams of people to make tunnels such as Tom, Dick, Harry, but also as well make civilian clothing, forge documents, procure contraband materials, and prevent guards from discovering their work. Flight Lieutenant Robert Hendley (James Garner) AKA 'The scrounger', job is finds what the others need, from a camera to clothes and identity cards. James gives the role, a great sly edge to the character. Australian Flying Officer Louis Sedgwick (James Coburn), "the manufacturer," makes tools such as picks for digging and bellows for pumping air into the tunnels. Flight Lieutenant Danny Velinski (Charles Bronson) is "the tunnel king" in charge of making the tunnels. Charles get down and dirty for this task. Forgery is handled by Flight Lieutenant Colin Blythe (Donald Pleasence) who brilliant acting is amazing, not only is he acting nearly blind from intricate work by candlelight, but Donald Pleasence was truly a real life prison of war during WWII. It took a lot out of him. One of the biggest character and screen time is spent on Captain Virgil Hilts (Steven McQueen), "The Cooler King," whom job is irritates guards with frequent escape attempts so he can recon what's outside the camp. . The information he brings back is used to create maps showing the nearest town and railway station. At this point, with multiply attempts, he would have been shot, but in the film, he's still escaping after time after time. Just go with it. He has a number of key scenes, like tossing a baseball in the cooler, the 4th of July celebrating, and others. Sometimes the film focus way too much of Hilts and little about the other characters, that it become known as only a Steven McQueen movie, when there are other fine actors in this movie. It's really a shame to see the other actors playing second fiddle to McQueen here. The movie gets better when they do escape, as the men find ways to get out of Nazi control areas by any means. No matter if it's by bus, train, boat, plane, or in case of Steve McQueen jumping over barb-wire fence with a motorcycle. Debunking a myth, McQueen didn't do the final jump as it was done by Bud Ekins, but McQueen did the other motorcycles stunts as well as playing the German guard. The ending after that can be really sad after watching 3 hours of the film, after seeing how much work went into escaping, but the film tries to leave the audience with a good note with scenes that their work wasn't in veil. The film was to some extent a work of fiction, based on the real events but with compromises made for purposes of commercial appeal, serving as a vehicle for its box-office stars. While many of its characters were fictitious, most were amalgams of several real characters and many were based on real people. There were no escapes by motorcycle, or aircraft. The screenwriters increased the importance of the roles of American POWs even to the point, that the real escape was by British not Americans. In reality Canadians played a prominent role in the construction of the tunnels and the escape itself. The film little mention them. Another example of Hollywood trying to convince the public that the Germans were idiots. It's hard to think that the Germans would allowed them to have it American flags, a drum, a flute, a still and all those potatoes. Plus all the shoe dye you could use. It's seem unrealish. Not only that the film has the escape in the summer, when it happen in the winter. One thing that the film goes right is the rousing Elmer Bernstein score which gives the movie it's famous tune. It's wonderful and catchy. The film is a triumph of the human spirit in the face of adversity. A classic film and iconic theme tune, but don't forget the sadness. Over 50 men were murdered by the Nazis for their part in the escape - facing death not in a field but often alone in a prison yard. Let us never forget such men and such bravery.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the All-Time Greats</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Great Escape, The (1963) **** (out of 4) One of the greatest films ever made deals with some POWs as they attempt to dig a tunnel underground and escape from a German camp. With the all-star cast, the terrific story and some masterful direction there's no question that this here deserves its high reputation and there's also no doubt that it's one of the greatest adventure films ever made. I think a lot of the credit must go to director John Sturges and I say this because even though the movie runs 170-minutes it actually feels like just a few minutes. It's rather amazing to see how short this movie actually feel and one of the things that I loved the most is how Sturges manages to keep the film moving at such a fast pace that you can't help but forget you're watching a movie. It almost feels as if you're actually there among these men and the way Sturges tells the story is much like a composer would come up with a score. There's just a certainly poetic flow to the movie that it really feels unlike anything else that I can think of. Of course, it doesn't hurt when you have a cast that includes excellent work from Steve McQueen, Charles Bronson, James Garner, Richard Attenborough, Donald Pleasence and James Coburn just to name a few. This is one of those films where every actor perfectly fits their part and this goes from the top to those with just a few lines in the picture. Another major plus is the way the director manages to build the suspense once the escape and the aftermath happens. Most people forget but after the escape we still have an hour worth of film left and many times directors would let the suspense fall after the big event but that doesn't happen here. The music score by Elmer Bernstein is among one of the greatest and most recognizable that you're ever going to hear and the cinematography from Daniel L. Fapp is equally impressive. THE GREAT ESCAPE is the type of movie that I'd say is timeless because it's subject matter is just something that's never going to die or get old.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good tragic war-adventure with a few faults</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The true story that The Great Escape is based on is indeed a remarkable one. It's certainly one of the key reasons that this war film has attained such a level of affection over the years. Although, it's ultimately hardly a happy story seeing as many of the participants never made it out alive. This is, for me its greatest trump card. As The Great Escape is essentially a tragedy dressed up as an upbeat war-adventure. It's an unusual combination but it works well. What has made the film so popular is no doubt a combination of this tragic true story with the rousing escape scenes, the all-star cast and the famous music. It's a war film that doesn't really have a lot of action; it's more of a character-based drama for the most part, so the people depicted here are fairly well-drawn. Although it does have to be said that the characters are not faultless ? James Coburn has truly the worst Australian accent I have ever heard, Charles Bronson's claustrophobia on the escape night is a tiresome addition to his character seeing as he was instrumental in actually building the tunnel, while Steve McQueen's character came across a little too devil-may-care to be entirely believable - the scene where he knocks over a guard with no repercussions at all was just stretching believability too much for me. In fact, overall, the film made the prisoner-of-war camp out to be a very lenient place indeed, where the inmates were seemingly at liberty to show blatant disrespect to the Germans, and were able to run rings round them quite easily. Now it may be that these details are based on reality, I cannot say with any certainty but I do have my doubts and I think that Hollywood has simply sugar-coated this side of the story. Nevertheless, despite these drawbacks The Great Escape remains an engaging film. Most probably, this is mainly due to the incredible cast at its disposal and a few iconic scenes. But also the simple fact that it's a great story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>When suspenseful and true negate dramatic and emotional in the war genre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As far as war films go, "The Great Escape" doesn't rank in the most dramatic or the most eye-opening. It doesn't even make the list of World War II epics with the most compelling characters. It's a movie with that intangible "it" factor that only comes from an impressive story. Films such as this one that are based on true events and real-life people (many of whom were acted by people with similar war experience), are the reason so many "based on a true story" movies have been made over the years. "The Great Escape" will have its skeptics because director John Sturges' approach to the film emphasizes suspense ahead of character development, which usually characterizes fiction. With a background in westerns, Sturges knows how to build up to and then milk the climactic scenes. The reason the final hour with the prisoners escaping is so good is because it took nearly two hours to get there. It certainly didn't help the film's credibility to have Steve McQueen demanding to "do more" in the film and insist on riding a motorcycle, but many remember "The Great Escape" for this reason.The true elements of the story come from an actual escape attempt by Allied POWs from a German stalag. Paul Brickhill, who wrote the book upon which the film is based, actually assisted in planning a tunneling effort. That should put to rest any questions about the film's validity. Undoubtedly characters were created by mashing together multiple real-life persons and their fates did not match exactly what happened to them in reality (who could know?), but this was no cheap Hollywood attempt to exploit a terrific true story. After all, the ending is certainly more akin to a war drama than entertaining historical fiction.Sturges calls upon many of the stars from "The Magnificent Seven" (released three years before this one) to assist him in this film: Steve McQueen as the leader figure notorious for getting in trouble and ending up in "the cooler" or isolation, Charles Bronson as Danny the lead tunneler who ironically is claustrophobic and James Coburn as Louis "The Manufacturer." Other notable stars are acclaimed actor/director Richard Attenborough, future James Bond villain Donald Pleasence and James Garner. What their characters lack in depth written into the script, these fine actors inject back into their roles as best they can."The Great Escape" takes a bit too long to get to the climax so clearly spelled out by the title, but the wait is worth it. The first hour and a half to two hours plays out as a series of episodes showing the preparations and the characters behind them, some more effective than others, but the movie earns its place in war film history with the final act. As these characters flee the prison, you start to realize how much you do indeed care about what happens to them. There's so much suspense inherent in the story and written into the script that a dramatically adept director could've made "The Great Escape" a monumental film, but thrilling and unique are acceptable adjectives when all is said and done, even if they could have been arrived at a tad bit quicker. After all, much of what there is to marvel at this film about has to do with its fascinatingly true story.~Steven Chttp://moviemusereviews.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Great Film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Great Escape is one of the greatest WWII films. The acting, direction, and story are perfect. Each and every one of the main characters is fresh and likable. At times, "Great Escape" is even moving, especially, for me, when Charles Bronson's character fights his claustrophobia. The movie never gets boring or to slow, even though it is 172 minutes long. Of course, there are some downsides to the film. It isn't historically accurate, and the campy atmosphere throughout can be overdone at times. Overall, the good more than makes up for my tiny complaints.I give "The Great Escape" a high 8/10, its #98 on my top 100. One of my favorite popcorn movies, I never get tired of seeing it. The only reason it doesn't get a 9 or a 10, is that the movie is pure entertainment. It doesn't really have anything to say. Definitely deserving of its reputation as a war classic. If you liked this movie, try "The Dirty Dozen", and "Hart's War" (a much weaker, but still fun, World War II POW film).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Escape and flight</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fun, optimistic prisoner-of-war movie about a group of Allied POWs put into a German camp exclusively for those who tend to try to escape. Thus, they try to escape, en masse. Care is put into the camaraderie, personality, and general friendliness of most of the characters, while showing in a couple scenes how nevertheless the imprisoned life is slowly demoralizing some of the men.The escape itself is interesting, but the movie really didn't focus a lot on the watchful Goons (Nazis), making it seem at times as if the whole camp is given free reign to just do what they choose--obviously, making escape much more likely. Somehow I kind of expect the whole ordeal that this movie is based off of was a bit more challenging and paranoid, and I would have liked to see that.Where the movie does get really good is post-escape, as the several characters split ways and attempt to get out of the country, to various results. Steve McQueen's bike chase is, of course, a famous scene, made all the more silly by the knowledge that McQueen himself is the one who suggested it, and all the more riveting because his own bike is used and he also doubled for one of the Germans, meaning in this movie Steve McQueen chases himself. One thing few prison or prisoner-of-war escape movies tend to focus on is the problem of getting back into the world after outside the prison walls--those movies tend to assume that once the tunnel is dug, freedom is pretty much a skip and a leap away. It's much more compelling to see the POWs trying to blend in, sneak through, hide, steal, row, ride, and fly their way out of the country.--PolarisDiB</fullReview>

From a British point of view, the Steve McQueen character is a little unbelievable, but it wouldn't be the film it is without him and the great motor cycle sequence.This film is full of character actors, some of whom went onto bigger and better movie roles but as an entire cast, the blend has rarely been bettered.Elements of the script show up in everyday conversation, and in identifying characters within your own business you will be able to ascribe characters from this film to their personalities.

		<shortDescription>Great Steve McQueen Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film deals with POW's who are sent to a new German prison camp with very tight security mainly because most of these POW's were all professional escape artists who have dug tunnels from many other German camps or simply escaped by climbing over fences and many other ways of escape. Steve MacQueen, (Capt. Hilts,) was also called "The Cooler King" because he always wound up in solitary confinement which was called the Cooler. James Garner, (Flight Lt. Hendley) was called the "Scounger" because he could obtain all kinds of necessary items in order to make escapes, like forged identification and many other items. Charles Bronson, (Flight Lt. Donny Velinski) was called the "Tunnel King" because he was great for making all kinds of tunnels. This film will keep you on the edge of your seat and the entire picture is not spent in the prison camp. There is great photography throughout Bavaria, Germany and Munich, Bavaria and great scenes with Steve MacQueen riding his bike and James Garner flying a German Training plane. Don't miss this film, it is great.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was so different then other war movies. It actually showed what happened after soldiers got captured by the Germans. I like the fact that they not depict all the Germans as bad human beings. And that they made clear that there was a distinction between the German army and Hitler's force. Most of the regular army weren't too glad with Hitler. And that fact is not shown too often in movies. "The Great Escape is a real visual treat with an all star cast.The all star cast (Steve McQueen,James Garner,James Coburn,Charles Bronson and many others)bring the characters to live and make everything very believable. It is fun to see them do everything they can to escape their prison. Escpecially when it comes to Steve McQueen. The scenes where he returns to his cell playing ball after another failed attempt in escaping are classic. Overall the balance between drama,comedy and action is perfect. "The Great Escape" is a masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Steve McQueen and James Garner lead a great ensemble cast in this great John Sturges directed war movie about an RAF escape attempt from a German POW camp.Outside of the Ocean's movies, there are not many great ensemble movies made these days due to the enormous salaries paid to the stars.It is an escape movie, but it plays like a caper flick. What they are stealing in this case, is their freedom. The setup is extremely complicated and fascinating. Of course, only 76 make it out instead of the planned 250, and not many experience freedom, but it still plays well after all these years.It is well worth watching again and again to see Steve McQueen's attempted escape on a motorcycle.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Undeniable Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Great Escape" is easily one of the greatest films ever made. It chronicles the story of a number of Allied prisoners sent to a Nazi prison camp during WWII. The imprisonment eventually leads to, as the title implies, a large-scale escape attempt.This film has everything. It has comedic moments throughout, especially with conversations between the main American officer and the jealous Asian SS guard (former Boy Scout). It also has a gripping plot and a cast of irresistible characters. As the film goes on, we learn to really like the prisoners. When the time comes and the escape begins,, our nerves rise up immediately. The film squeezes you and never lets go.Steve McQueen and Richard Attenborough give career defining roles, each with intense escape scenes of their own. The motorcycle chase involving McQueen, for example, is one of the greatest chase scenes ever filmed."The Great Escape" is deep, gripping, exciting, emotional, sad, enthralling, moving, inspiring, and unrelentlessly phenomenal. It is easily the greatest war-time prison camp film of its time, and will be enjoyed by countless generations to come.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This has to be one of the most entertaining films ever made. It has a mixture of American and European actors who all find their niche in this very powerful and inspiring story. Not only do the actors star in this film -- the score by Elmer Bernstein is also part of the package instilling a great deal of energy and excitement. The story speaks for itself ,it really manages to convey the ingenuity and courage of these men -- a selflessness that makes you proud to be human! The film expertly directed by John Sturges never sags and tells each story of the escapees with sensitivity.Note how Richard Attenborough enters into the film with the feeling that he has seen and felt the horrors of gestapo interrogation in the most understated way.All the characters and the way they relate to each other is fascinating. James Garner,Donald Pleasance, David McCallum , Gordon Jackson, Charles Bronson, John Leyton ,Nigel Stock ,Angus Lennie, Hans Messemer,James Donald and lastly my favourite film actor Steve McQueen.He is mesmerising and seems to single handedly take over the film -- his mastery of the motorcycle also gives the film its iconic moment.For all that the film manages to convey the horror and terror of war.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Give up your hopeless attempt to escape."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm getting around to viewing films I might have seen only once many years ago and usually upon their original theatrical release, so today I had the opportunity to take a look at "The Great Escape". It's funny how you recollect some things from a movie and not others. Virtually everyone can recall the thrilling motorcycle chase by Steve McQueen's character, while for some reason I distinctly remember the manner in which the POW's got rid of the dirt from the tunnels. On the flip side, I had to be reminded of the potato vodka scene ('no smoking while you're drinking!'), and Hendley (James Garner) snookering Werner (Robert Graf) out of his wallet.The thought that struck me today was how sanitized the movie appears to be compared to what real conditions must have been like, even in an elite camp for captured Air Force and RAF officers. Though I can grant that officers of the German Luftwaffe might have harbored a professional respect for fellow fliers, it seems that a character like Captain Hilts (McQueen) probably should have worn out his welcome after only a single escape attempt. But it's a true story, so somewhere between the reality of the actual event and poetic license used in the film there lies a fascinating tale.McQueen of course is exceptional in his role, as are Richard Attenborough, Charles Bronson and Donald Pleasence. Garner is top billed with McQueen and Attenborough in the opening credits, though his role seems underplayed compared to the other two, while James Coburn seems to achieve more visibility after the escape. The film offers an interesting convention with it's assortment of vignettes featuring each of the main characters in relation to one another.While watching, one might need to bring a grittier sense of reality to the proceedings than offered on screen, as the grim prospect of tunneling fifty tons of dirt never seems to weigh on events as they unfold. There's also the lack of perspective in regards to the time it took for the escape to occur, even though the video sleeve stated that six hundred British and American Air Force men took over a year to plan and execute the largest ever mass escape in history in March of 1944. A follow up to what happened to the successful escapees would have been a nice touch as well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Some of the grandest entertainment ever caught on celluloid</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Over forty years on, this is still one of the greatest adventure films ever made. More thrilling, suspenseful, funnier, and with better heroes than in a million of those lame Vin Diesel / Steven Segal type flicks. This film is one of the few I can say in perfect in every aspect and is epic and long but certainly never boring. Plus, Steve McQueen's star turn is too cool for words.One of the main strengths of the film is the character development throughout. Most war movies will stick to tired stereotype characters and macho patriotic heroes. The POWs in this film are macho and patriotic, but have many more aspects to them than just that. Every single one of the lead performances is memorable and the entire ensemble cast works very well. The combination of humor and action is the best ever in a film. The first half is mostly barracks comedy but still maintains some realism and avoids slapstick. The second half, detailing the actual escape, is thrilling. The tonal shift certainly works well. Plus the score by Elmer Bernstein is a classic.For all of its other attributes, the film is mainly remembered for one reason - Steve McQueen. As the Cooler King, he is one of the coolest and most likable movie heroes. His triumphant jump on the motorcycle over the fence is one of the best sequences ever in a film. This is the greatest adventure film ever made, and is for that reason a must-see. Some of the grandest entertainment ever caught on celluloid. (10/10)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My Dad rented this movie for us a few years ago, when I was twelve or thirteen. I admit, at first I was doubtful: it was a nearly-three-hour war movie, and I was supposed to enjoy it? Yes, I was, and I more than did. There are a few movies I've watched that I didn't expect much out of but that I ended up loving, but this one surpasses them all. Most three-hour movies, even my absolute favorite ones, move rather slow. This movie, however, is surprisingly quick-paced. Only movies like "Sound of Music" and A&amp;E's "Pride and Prejudice", and now this one, have managed to be so long, yet so quick paced.The acting is very good, and each and every character is engaging. This is possibly one of the few feel-good war movies out there, and is possibly also the most upbeat and fun to watch. You cheer the prisoners every second of the way as they try to make their great escape. Truly unforgettable 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From what I have heard from actual POWs, this is a reasonably accurate portrayal of what it was like to be held in a POW camp run by the Luftwaffe. "Firm but fair" on the whole. And far better than the alternative, i.e. being held captive by the Gestapo or SS. The Great Escape is a true story that has been doctored for Hollywood. There was an escape from Sagan camp, and 76 did get away. Of these, 3 made it to freedom. The rest were recaptured and fifty of them were shot by the SS on Hitler's orders; in groups of 2 and 3 though, not in the more dramatic mass-shooting we see in the film. Big X (Attenborough) was named Bushell, not Bartlett, and in fact there were no Americans in the camp. Garner and McQueen were included for box office appeal. Also, all the prisoners in the movie are in their late 30s and upwards ? in reality almost all of them would have been closer to 20 than 30. But, once you acknowledge that the movie is not a 100% accurate depiction of what happened, but simply an enjoyable film based on the true story, with some invented motorcycle stunt work thrown in for good measure, you can sit back and enjoy, and feel admiration for all those who fought on the winning side in that cataclysmic war for the survival of freedom.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Great Escape to the Movies!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film can make the 'greatest' list in so many categories, it's unbelievable! Greatest War Film; greatest chase; greatest historical piece; and let's begin with the greatest cast: I don't see too many surveys done on which film has the best overall cast, but this one must be it. McQueen - the king of cool and number one star with this film; Garner - almost as cool as McQueen; Attenborough - never utilized better than as Big X, the Brit stiff upper lip; Bronson - future superstar as a steady presence; Coburn - insolent mod sixties before it was chic; Pleasence - the quiet English reserve masking a powerhouse character; McCallum - before taking over TV with superspy Solo. And the beauty of it was, they were all packed together in one spot (one camp), plotting and scheming together until the inevitable chasing began.This is the perfect adventure film and is endowed with an aura of greatness because it's based on real facts during the greatest war in the history of the world. It made a real impression on me when I saw it as a kid. I was fascinated by all the chief characters as they were introduced, all seemingly trapped forever in a cycle of escape and capture (as I was very young at the time, the length of World War II seemed like half a lifetime to me). Forced into such an existence, each character became an expert - not only in the art of escape - but in other esoteric disciplines, as well. In a way, the story comes across as an ideal game to a boy: the good guys are the best at what they do and must match wits with their captors, the bad Nazis. There's a lot of tension built up right from the start (as McQueen and others try their first escape attempts on the first day) but it's the planning by the prisoners, which we are privy to, that provides a truly interesting film experience. Some of the solutions they come up with are ingenious.And then, the 3rd act, the actual escape. Where one usually expects a film so strong in the beginning and middle to bog down a bit, this one just explodes all over Germany. Though I've seen McQueen's mad dash on the motorcycle 15 times by now, it's still as thrilling as ever. But it's not just him; you follow along with many of the escapees in their clever, sometimes desperate bids for freedom. Again, it's a great game, but the possibilities and consequences can have a tremendous impact.</fullReview>

It's simply that much of its action takes place AWAY from the front lines, the same as "Schindler's List." And, I don't hear anyone calling THAT a non-WWII movie! Plus, a lot of the cast were portraying composite characters (semi-fictionalized amalgams of some of the actual escapees). Fans of the original "Jurassic Park" will learn that Richard Attenborough could (and still can) portray more than just lovably eccentric-but-misguided millionaire grandfathers. And, Charles Bronson and James Coburn (both sadly gone, now) practically steal all the scenes that Steve McQueen isn't in! So, my final analysis is now, and forever more,...TEN STARS!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very entertaining war movie, but looks dated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just saw this for the first time last night after hearing so many good things about it over the years. My initial impression was that this is so far from what you think of when you think German POW camp that it bordered on the absurd. But then I heard that indeed the Luftwaffe ran the camp and their camps were much more humane than the Concentration Camps that have received much more attention.The suspense of the movie is great and I loved the fact that it did not have a "Hollywood ending". Nevertheless, several details point to the obvious fact that this movie was a Hollywood product and that it was from a period before realism and authenticity became necessary to win over audiences. In summary, my objections are: 1. The POW's looked very well fed, clean-shaved and illness free throughout. I can understand that this was not Auschwitz, but come on! 2. A remarkable number of German officers spoke excellent English. Perhaps this was needed to keep the story moving along, but it was completely ridiculous.3. Similarly, many of the prisoners, once they are on the run, show a command of German that seems hard to believe. As anyone knows, most people can spot a foreigner the second they open their mouth to speak because of their accent. Yet Bartlett passes for German with no difficulty at all.These may seem like minor quibbles, but they are indicative of an age when audiences were perhaps less cynical and Hollywood could get away with a lot more.All in all, a great movie, but a dated one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Really, this is just a great caper flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's interesting to read all of the rave reviews this movie gets. "Best war movie ever" and so forth. I admit its good, and an excellent example of the Hollywood movie making machine in full epic mode, but it's hardly the best war movie ever made. In fact, its not really a war movie at all. Its a jail breakout movie. It is more similar to movies like "escape from Alcatraz", "the hot rock" and "heat" and "the Italian job" than it is to Saving Private Ryan or full metal jacket.It's also interesting how the focus of the hype for the movie focuses on Steve McQueen, when in fact, if anyone owns this movie, its James Garner. He displays the best range, is on the screen longer than anyone else and his role displays all of the ambiguities that were involved in the POW situation. Plus, cool for cool, he gives Steve a run for his money. McQueen on the other hand spends most of his time throwing a baseball and giving his trademark ambiguous smile and waiting to ride his motorcycle.The rest of cast is a perfect bit of type casting, starting with Bronson, through Coburn and the rest. A pity Mr. Coburn wasn't given more to work with, but then, I've always liked him. Donald Pleasance makes the movie real.As for Richard Attenborough, am I the only one cheering for the Germans against him by the end of the film? Maybe its just because he inflicted the world with the movie "Gandhi" but I find the man to be a supercilious twit. But again, that's kind of what his role called for.As for the rest of the film, all very competently done, sets are good (although interiors look a little like cardboard at times) and someone could have dressed the Germans better. They all look like they bought off the rack uniforms without getting them altered. The theme music was as unmistakable as the pink panther or a spaghetti western, you can whistle it after the movie ends.Lastly, and this was sort of inadvertent, watching this movie with so many great stars in their youthful prime, one is left with a sense of wistfulness now that most are dead and the remainder are a bunch of old men. Just like the real POWS.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie dramatizes the true story of a great escape of POW's from the Stalag Luft III camp in Upper Silesia, today Poland, during WW II. The script was written by James Clavell (Shogun, Tai-Pan) based on a novel by Paul Brickhill. The plot of the film is a little bit romanticized but nevertheless truly to the facts, and so it is a homage to the airmen cruelly executed by the Nazis. The movie is largely benefited of the participation of a set of known actors which do a very good job. The director John Sturges sets a light tone, with a lot of humor, smoothing the film, considering the cruel destiny of the fugitives. We can divide the movie in two parts. On the first, we see how the escape is planned and all the details of the preparation of a such a huge escape are presented: how to build the tunnels, the forgery of the documents, the making of the civil clothes, and so on. On the second part, we see how the fugitives try to get to a neutral country and the different approaches tried for each one: robbing a motorcycle and running to the frontier, traveling by train to France, going on foot sneaking through the fields, etc. Finally, I think that the scene of the execution of the 50 fugitives chosen is particularly touching and we feel grateful to the courage of these men, who fought the Nazis till the end.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Performance by the characters leaves behind the direction. Steve McQueen is no doubt the star performer with his bike chase and all. The plot is gripping towards the end. The Germans guards in the prison are shown to be incredibly lenient. Imagine which prison (that too German) would give such mild punishments to its inmate for escaping the 17th time! The movie is all about smart ideas to escape from the prison and there the movie scores pretty well. I am not saying it outwits modern day movies but its quite realistic.Its quite exciting to imagine yourself (temporarily!) in place of the prisoners. Despite the leverage the movie deserves for being based on a true story, the movie is a good watch. I give it a 7.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Great Escape is definitely one of my top 10 films of all time, mainly because of the powerful and outstanding performances and gripping plot. As an Englishman, every time I hear the theme tune, I can't help but smile, and think of Steve McQueen on his motorbike, Richard Attenborough and his crafty ways as "Big X", and the rest of this rare cast that made this picture truly special. It captivates the audience and holds you in suspense and enjoyment unlike few other war films ever could. But more than anything, this movie influences all who watch it. It makes you think about the reality behind the spectacular story, and makes you want to return and watch the whole experience time and again. A masterpiece and true classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When we first saw this movie in 1963 at Washington DC's RKO KEITH'S THEATRE, all 1,850 seats were filled and there were several hundred standees, no doubt in violation of the fire codes. I've never seen such a full movie-house. I was fully taken in by the star studded cast, the patriotic true story, the starring score by Elmer Bernstein, and the wonderful cinematography of the European landscape. I could not understand the Luke-warm reviews in Washington's four newspapers. 43 years later I can see the reviewers were right. This was a mediocre movie designed simply as a popular entertainment.Where John Sturges and James Clavel went wrong was stacking the deck so totally in favor of the American prisoners and against their German captors, the film has all the suspense of a 30 to zero ball game. While the Americans plot and execute the escape, at no time do the Germans lift a finger to prevent it. Everything goes smoothly according to plan. Anything and everything the prisoners need is simply found with no great effort amongst the prison grounds. How silly! Even when the Germans stumble upon the tunnel entrance under the stove, their only reaction is to look down the hole. No disciplinary action follows, not even yelling.In 1963, Hollywood hadn't yet learned to hate America. This was NOT a rotten revisionist history travesty such as Jerry Bruckheimer's PEARL HARBOR or Steven Spielberg's PRIVATE RYAN. The filmmaker's hearts were in the right place. But the 50 men to whom the film is dedicated truly were deserving of a good film being made in their honor. More a kid-flick than a serious drama, this picture does not deserve inclusion in the top 250 --- or 2,000.</fullReview>

The problem is that "cool's eternal, but it's always dated." I can see how he coudl have been viewed as cool, but the story behind the film seems, to me, mediocre at best. The music is well-known and enjoyable, but the story of the film could have been a much deeper statement about the futility of war, and what does it end up being? A place to watch McQueen showboat. My opinions could be totally misplaced here; but I did not see anything spectacular about this film. Stalag-17 seems a much greater film with a similar story.ZooTrouble</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One thing that puzzles me about McQueen's attire in "The Great Escape". How come he's the only one who doesn't wear any uniform? And his clothing is more like the 1960s with his tight white pants and sweat shirt. And he seemed more intent at playing a cool 1960s rebellious character than the 1940s officer he was supposed to be. Didn't the director have any control over him at all? Or was Steve McQueen only interested in his image? He looked totally out of place even amongst the other Americans in the camp. I accept the fact that as it was a Hollywood production there would be a fair number of US actors in it. According to a recent documentary on British TV, only 3 Americans were incarcerated in the POW camp - the remainder being British, Australians and the other Commonwealth countries, Poles, French and Dutch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>EditIn 1943, having expended enormous resources on recapturing escaped Allied prisoners of war (POWs), the Germans move the most determined to a new, high-security prisoner of war camp. The commandant, Luftwaffe Colonel von Luger (Hannes Messemer), tells the senior British officer, Group Captain Ramsey (James Donald), "There will be no escapes from this camp." Von Luger points out the various features of the new camp designed to prevent escape, as well as the advantages that the prisoners will receive as an incentive not to try. After several failed escape attempts on the first day, the POWs settle into life at the prison camp.Meanwhile, Gestapo and SD agents bring RAF Squadron Leader Roger Bartlett (Richard Attenborough) to the camp. Known as "Big X", Bartlett is introduced as the principal organiser of escapes. As Kuhn (Hans Reiser) leaves, he warns Bartlett that if he escapes again, he will be shot. However, locked up with "every escape artist in Germany", Bartlett immediately plans the greatest escape attempted, with tunnels for breaking out 250 prisoners, to the point that as many troops and resources as possible will be wasted on finding POWs instead of being used on the front line.Teams are organised to support the effort. Flight Lieutenant Robert Hendley (James Garner), an American in the RAF, is "the scrounger" who finds needed materials, from a camera to clothes and identity cards. Australian Flying Officer Louis Sedgwick (James Coburn), "the manufacturer," makes necessary tools like picks for digging and bellows for pumping air into the tunnels. Flight Lieutenants Danny Valinski (Charles Bronson) and William "Willie" Dickes (John Leyton) are "the tunnel kings" in charge of digging the tunnels. Flight Lieutenant Andrew MacDonald (Gordon Jackson) acts as intelligence provider and Bartlett's second-in-command. Lieutenant Commander Eric Ashley-Pitt (David McCallum) of the Royal Navy devises a method of spreading soil from the tunnels over the camp, under the guards' noses. Flight Lieutenant Griffith (Robert Desmond) acts as "the tailor", creating civilian outfits from scavenged cloth. Forgery is handled by Flight Lieutenant Colin Blythe (Donald Pleasence), who becomes nearly blind due to progressive myopia caused by intricate work by candlelight; Hendley takes it upon himself to be Blythe's guide in the escape. The prisoners work on three tunnels simultaneously, calling them "Tom", "Dick", and "Harry".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Great Escape is one of those films that you could watch time and time again and still love even more with each viewing. Imagine a movie where you would put all the greatest movie stars of their Era in. That's exactly what they did here! The Great Escape is, in my mind, the greatest War movie of all Time. Add to the stellar cast, a score by Legendary Hollywood composer Elmer Bernstein and there you have one of the greatest War movie themes of all Time. A theme with a tune so catchy, so memorable that you might find yourself humming and whistling it as you go through your day. The Great Escape is basically the story of POW during War time in their Nazi detention camp. And what are, not just POW but the best POW, up to in their enemy detention camp? They plan their escape. An escape so ingenious that it involves digging three tunnels at the same time underneath and through their camp to the wood outside. In the main role we have Hollywood Legend, Steve McQueen as Lieutenant Virgil Hilts, a hot shot American pilot who has only one idea in his head, escaping! One of the most interesting scene for me was at the end, when Hilts, recaptured again, is about to be put back in his cell inside the cooler. There you have a German guard ready to put our hero, who incidentally is the personification of the perfect Aryan (according to Hitler), blue eyed and blond hairs, into his cell. As the guard closes the door and walks away from Hilts'cell, he hears the noise of Hilts' baseball bouncing off the walls, back and forth into Hilts' baseball glove. He pauses for an instant as if to ponder whether what he is doing to the embodiment of the perfect German specimen is wrong. He lowers his head, then walks away with his head held down as if to convey that he realizes that what he is doing is indeed wrong and that he could never break Hilts' strong spirit. I highly recommend this all time Classic for all, a masterpiece!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>THE GREAT ESCAPE is the type of movie that I wud say is timeless because its subject matter is just something thats never going to die or get old. Its a golden classic. I saw this movie so many times n still doesn't get burn out. The acting and character development is outstanding and is something that is hardly seen today. The direction is top notch. Each character is extremely well-developed. The director takes extra care to make sure we understand each of their roles and motivation. One of the best ensemble casts I've ever seen. James Coburn, Charles Bronson, Steve McQueen, James Garner, James Donald, Donald Pleasence, Richard Attenborough, David McCallum, John Leyton, Gordon Jackson.... and the list goes on.&nbsp; Almost 3 hours long n you can barely find a dull moment, which is fantastic, the movie is pretty fast paced all the way through. It is a well written story that holds your interest all the way through. The music score by Elmer Bernstein is among one of the greatest and most recognizable that you are ever going to hear and the cinematography from Daniel L. Fapp is equally impressive. The editing is done by Ferris Webster. The actual escape is filled with suspense, and the last hour of the movie we see them on the run, by plane, train, on foot, and in McQueens case, by motorcycle. By this time, we are rooting for each character as they all try to make it out of Germany. With Richard Attenborough as the leader and Steve McQueen as the unforgettable Cooler King. Its directed by John Sturges ( Bad Day at Black Rock, The Magnificent Seven, Joe Kidd).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I won't insult your intelligence by discussing the nature of it's plot. Even of you've lived as a hermit for the past 50 years, you'll hear the words "Great Escape" and know exactly what I'm talking about. Engraving Steve McQueen into the annals of pop culture and giving new meaning to the term "war movie", the masses considered the film to be "THE Great Escape".Personally, I thought it was slightly overrated. It will never touch classics such as Patton, A Bridge Too Far and The Dirty Dozen. Still, don't get me wrong, it is one great war movie, just not the GREATEST. A fun 2 hours and 45 minutes was spent watching it and the events unfolding throughout the story were thrilling to say the least. The Great Escape is an immortal testament to the inspiring determination and shrewdness of an extraordinary bunch of individuals and the bond they shared. The film has the benefit of a staunch script with each scene flowing nicely. Although her we have the problem. The film is a little overlong which therefore allows much of the dialogue to dry out. The movie also becomes tedious when you're seeing the same huts and barbed wire fences. This is why it's first half can be difficult to get through. When lacking in action and suspense, this is understandable. However, the sequences involving the planning and execution of the escape do provoke interest by engaging the mind. The detail of the script and of the actual escape itself will never cease to fascinate me. The second half of the movie is much more exciting and takes full advantage of the Panavision cinematography. With it's sweeping vistas of snow capped peaks and lush green plains, this is one war film that is a lot more easier on the eye. The editing techniques too are praiseworthy. Most of the film's second half is crammed with cutaways of different characters making their bid for freedom. This cranks up the pace and builds excitement towards the end of the film.It's stellar cast is comprised of some fine acting talent. The performances were superb, but none of them really stood out for me. Steve McQueen was pretty cool as Hilts and made for a great ode to teenage rebelliousness. The best performances came from Donald Pleasance and Charles Bronson. Richard Attenborough was good as Bartlett, as was Hannes Messemer as Colonel Von Luger, the camp commandant. The film has very little action and the action sequences come in abrupt, but tense bursts. I found the famed motorcycle chase to be a little anticlimactic but awesome nonetheless. The escape from the camp via the underground tunnel had me perched on the edge of my seat and John Sturges kept the suspense rigidly tight throughout the last half of the film. The suspense is ten times more electrifying than the action itself and puts the "Great" into the title. Elmer Bernstein's score is decent, but we've all heard it before somewhere.To say it's not all it's cracked up to be would be rather harsh, just don't expect too much from it upon your first viewing. However, The Great Escape is an intriguing time passer which will hold your interest. If you're any kind of war movie fan, you must see it at least once. 7.5/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Archetypal Prisoner-of-War Drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Over the last half-century THE GREAT ESCAPE has established itself as THE prisoner-of-war drama for future directors interested in the genre to emulate. There are other films which can compete for this title (Billy Wilder's STALAG 17 (1953)) is a good candidate), but John Sturges' film simply gets everything right, from the ensemble cast to the locations and Elmer Bernstein's iconic theme tune. There is no need to rehearse the plot; rather we should pay attention to the way Sturges creates character cameos to show how the escape was essentially a team effort in which everyone - regardless of rank or nation - played their part. Donald Pleasance's Blythe ("The Forger") proves exceptionally adept at his task, even though his myopia hinders the escape when it actually takes place. Charles Bronson's Danny ("The Tunnel King") becomes almost paralyzed with fear when the time comes to escape; it is as if he cannot contemplate the prospect of life outside. Even James Donald, as the SBO (Senior British Officer) has his part to play - although not actively involved in the escape - he knows how to manage his German captors. The set-designs (Kurt Ripberger) and photography (Daniel L. Fapp) are wondrous; we get sense of the claustrophobia of the prison-camp, which is only exacerbated in the tunnels; this is contrasted with the wide expanses of the Alps as the fugitives make their futile bids to reach the Swiss border. While there might be some slightly jarring elements (James Coburn's Australian accent is rather eccentric, to be polite), THE GREAT ESCAPE is nothing less than a timeless classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First off, has John Sturges ever directed a true "stinker?" This may not be among his very best but at times it shines although as many have already commented, despite not portraying anything much like the real event. This flick benefits from good writing and quality performances from all: The 1st-team (Garner, McQueen, Attenborogh), 2nd team (Bronson, Pleasence, Coburn, etc.) and an array of 3-stringers. The score - and especially the main theme, are superb; production values are high, and action vs dialogue, side plots, etc. are all well balanced and/or above par. For 1963 this is more like a big-budget adventure pix of the 40s: It depends upon story and not pyrotechnics. Well worth a view for the uninitiated, for most it is probably a worthwhile DVD investment especially now given its budget-price.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Exploring the Strategy of a POW Prison Break</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This cool little movie is based upon the true story of a large number of World War II Prisoners of War who escaped from a Luftwaffe POW camp in the middle of Germany. The camp was set up to house those prisoners that proved to be a problem because they kept on trying to escape and this camp was supposed to be escape proof. As soon as the prisoners arrived though they began to look for ways to escape and even found some. The focus of the escape though is through one colonel who decides that if he can break 200 men out of the camp then it will be a severe hindrance to the German war effort.The colonel is confronted by the Commandant and he is asked not to escape but the reply is that it is the prisoner's duty to escape. Escaping prisoners tie up soldiers that could be used in the front: not only must they be guarded but more must be sent out to round up prisoners that have escaped. Thus if 200 prisoners escape and all go their own way then the Germans are going to have to implement an enormous amount of manpower to recapture them. Ideally they would simply take no prisoners, but such actions are against the Geneva convention. Even so, for all of their brutality, it is surprising that the Nazi's did actually take prisoners. The conclusion to the conversation is that the commandant wants the prisoners to comply but because the prisoners are the enemy then it is their duty to escape.I liked the movie: it was tense but it was also funny. Steve McQueen's character was the one that added a lot of life to the movie. He was the one that came up with all of the bright ideas to escape, and the one that was always caught and put into the cooler. He actually seemed to spend more time in the cooler than out of it.The movie also portrayed the brutality of the Germans. Even though they did seem to look after the prisoners of War, the ones that continually escaped were simply gunned down by the Gestapo. They had become sick of this escaping POW's so they warned them that if they were caught again then they would be shot. The Gestapo made that promise and they kept it. It still seems very harsh, but this was a war and no matter what the Geneva convention says, there is no rules in war and the allies were just as brutal as the German's were.The movie was tense especially in the scene where they discover the tunnel, and even when they are escaping and people begin to panic. You are wanting them all to get out, but this is not going to happen. One must remember that this is real life and not some ideal Hollywood creation. As such not everybody was going to escape. Even more so, from 76 escapees, 50 were killed and a small number were captured. Only 3 were shown escaping, one of them being an Australian.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic Rip-Roaring Second World War Adventure Story With Tremendous Cast</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>During World War II, a group of Allied prisoners notorious for escaping from captivity are sent to a custom-made POW camp in the German countryside. Can they break out while their jailers are watching their every move ?A great international co-production, this classic wartime escape drama is one of the best films of the sixties and one of the most entertaining ensemble casts in any movie. I particularly like the mix of nationalities in both the cast and characters, and everybody is terrific in it, right down to the smallest part. McQueen and Attenborough, as the epitome of American Cool and British Stiff Upper Lip respectively, were both never better, but the real stars for me are Pleasence as Blythe, the genial forger who gradually realises he's going blind, and Bronson as Danny, the Polish tunnel king with a painful secret behind his tough guy persona. Everybody works together brilliantly, often in unlikely pairings, and despite its three-hour length the movie never seems languid or dull. The men are so well observed and the drama unfolds in a way which is both realistic but also consistently amusing and exciting. It's also one of those rare Hollywood blockbusters which doesn't cop out at the end; we want the heroes to escape so badly, yet only misery and death await so many of them. After his phenomenal success with The Magnificent Seven, Sturges turns in another masterful epic adventure film, brimming with suspense, humour and pathos. Elmer Bernstein's sweeping score, with its irresistibly catchy main theme, is simply brilliant - a great brassy fanfare of music and the perfect accompaniment to the action. Equally impressive is the editing by old pro Ferris Webster, which takes what on paper are hours and hours of stodgy dialogue scenes and somehow turns them into nail-biting intrigue. Extremely well written by W.R. Burnett and James Clavell, from a book by Paul Brickhill, based on his real-life experiences in Stammlager Luft POW camp in Silesia/Poland. For a hilarious alternative version of the story, try to see the 1977 Michael Palin/Terry Jones Ripping Yarns episode Escape From Stalag Luft 112B. Trivia - in reality, Donald Pleasence was an RAF pilot in WWII who was shot down and captured, and during the production Bronson met McCallum's wife, Jill Ireland, whom he later married ! Shot on authentic Bavarian locations, this is a brilliant film in every respect, a great little WWII history lesson for boys of all ages, and a much-beloved adventure classic by one of the great old-time directors. 7/10</fullReview>

It plays out under a banner of surprisingly upbeat, somewhat comical, borderline happy-go-lucky entertainment ? it seems most of the characters held within the prisoner of war camp, which we spend most of the film's runtime within, are quite enjoying trying to escape; frustrating the Nazi officials; repeatedly risking their lives and, oddest of all, spending time in a small concrete six by four hole which is named 'The Cooler'. War films demand conflict, and they usually demand a certain sense of action spectacle which, handled, correctly doubles up as the film's bloody and unappealing warfare; The Great Escape appears to want to have it every other which way. Here is a war film that has so much fun for its first hour and a half that when the time comes for its character to bolt for the blue, it isn't sure how to deal with some of their expeditions into the wider unknown and flits uncontrollably from ups to downs, morphing its atmosphere rather uncontrollably from terror to tragedy to excitement to relief and then back again.We begin with a procession of trucks and vehicles transporting Allied prisoners to an isolated camp in rural Germany during World War 2. Over the credits they travel, journeying deeper and deeper into the forests; across the roads and over the hills until that sense of being deep into the middle of absolutely nowhere is effectively established. The measure of how far the prisoners whom we focus on go, from arriving at the camp to doing what they do, is effectively established when they step out of the trucks upon arrival: they're bleary eyed rabble of a bunch, a little lost in their new surroundings and not entirely together yet 'as one'. The following scene sees a British officer speak to the camp's leader; the German towering over him as he stands instead of sitting and lays out the rules, the officer's leg based injury a further establishment of the superiority he has in comparison. The dialogue shot in profile so as to get across the degrees of conflict between them but then somewhat such a composition relinquished when middle ground is reached and immediate conflict dissipates through agreement, even if it is retained in essence.The camp itself is the Germans placing of all those whom are guilty of repeated escape attempts from other camps into one big camp that they believe is capable of holding all of them. Once out, it's always inferred neutral Switzerland is the place to head toward; the powers that be seemingly counteracting this by having the camp far away enough that a fighter plane voyage won't get you across the border. So as to engulf the widest possible audience for the film, we come to revolve around an array of men from an array of backgrounds of an array of different nationalities. An amusing scene early on highlights the clashing of these cultures, backgrounds and attitudes; an American more broadly representative of most of the film's Americans speaks to a British character, again posing as a broader representation of people of his nationality, about how hunting and shooting birds rather than sketching them and that riding motorcycles instead of your more bog-standard, boring even, bicycles is more preferable in either case.Of the film's Americans, Steve McQueen's captain named Virgil Hilts is a man continuously pushing the boundaries of what the Germans might tolerate, a young rebellious sort whom later adopts the mantle of the film's lead action man. Regarding the British, Richard Attenborough's Roger Bartlett is granted a separate arrival to that of everybody else complete with S.S. escort, his expertise in escaping from camps built up through other's dialogue whilst he's off screen whereas Donald Pleasence's Flight lieutenant named Colin Blythe, a man who's a dab hand at forging whatever need forging in what is itself a skill which requires precision and patience, is a more heartwarming presence as he himself undergoes his own subplots to do with health and friendships with another inmate. With an array of supporting acts, none of whom in the form of Scottish; Polish or Australian prisoners match up to the strength in ability and smarts as the English or Americans, the Pole of whom later needs his hand practically held so as to get through the tough stuff to freedom, the film uses the premise to tell a true story in a relatively interesting manner of how several men broke out of a POW fortress.The film is a fairly engaging piece for the best part, its stuff to do with character done and dusted by the time the planning and executing of several escape attempts plays out; Hilts' early attempt to just go for it thwarted with ease establishing a sense that time and due care is almost certainly required. The film isn't concerned as much about plot as it is with telling a tale of how something happened, in a somewhat precise manner which has the film all too annoyingly resemble that of a montage in doing one thing; planning the next stage and fulfilling that bit ? sometimes it works, others it doesn't and they have to take a step backwards. On occasion, the flag waving in that the Americans bail the Brits out on occasion is tiresome; James Garner's Lieutenant Hendley aiding Blythe at the risk of his own expense as well as Hilt's sacrifices early on so as to aid Bartlett in their tunnel digging a tad odd. Regardless, director John Sturges keeps the film moving; and while the 172 minutes do fly past fairly quickly whilst we're stuck in this prison, that fact is more of an achievement than the film is as a whole actually is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Taut POW Escape Story.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This long movie is organized along the same lines as "The Dirty Dozen." The first two thirds of the running time introduce us to the characters and their organization around a common goal. In "The Dirty Dozen" it was a suicide mission for condemned prisoners. Here it's escape from a prison camp for Allied airmen in Bavaria. The last third deals with the execution of the plan.It's well written and there are some understated comic touches interspersed with the suspenseful tale of the digging of the escape tunnel, the preparation of fake papers, the manufacture of civilian clothing from scraps and rags and blankets.The implementation of the plan, the last third, turns serious. Of the 250 men designated as escapees, only 70 get out and most of those are either captured and returned or killed outright by the Gestapo.Actually, this is a pretty nice camp compared to, say, that in "Stalag 17." It's situated among the rolling green hills and evergreen woods and distant mountains, rather like a picture postcard or a fairy tale or a particularly ornate cuckoo clock. The camp is strictly for hardcore escapees and is run by the Luftwaffe in a determined but not entirely unfriendly manner. The barracks themselves are spacious and reasonably comfortable. At the end, Steve McQueen is returned to the camp just as the sympathetic Luftwaffe officer is being relieved of command and taken away by the Gestapo to God knows where. "Well," the officer remarks to McQueen, "It looks like you will see Berlin before I do." I thought it was ungracious of McQueen to smirk.The other Germans we see, outside the camp, are stereotypical bastards. The fifty men who are to be executed are brought together by the Gestapo, whose commanding officer tells Richard Attenborough, "You vill be sorry dzhat you put us to zo motch twubble." It's an enjoyable flick, filled with diverse pleasures and some tragic moments. It seems to have acquired a following whose devotion to the movie borders on cultism. I'm not sure why. The performances are all decent but it's a formulaic movie and the roles don't give anyone much of a chance to stretch his acting chops. Steve McQueen is not the epitome of cool that he was to become in a few years. John Sturges' direction is functional, effective, commercial, and exciting, as it was in many of his other action films.Nicely done.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Takes Stalag 17 and Improves Upon It</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the tradition of Billy Wilder's "Stalag 17", we have a group of soldiers (some seemingly American, some British) trapped in a German POW camp. Steve McQueen, who plays the Cooler King, has tried to escape many times before... but now there's a whole campwide effort to dig tunnels under the camp. Can it work? James Garner, who plays the Scrounger, really steals the show. McQueen is top billed, and plays the handsome lead, but he really just works on the outskirts of the plot for most of the film. Garner is right in the center, fulfilling the role William Holden had in "Stalag" and Morgan Freeman would have in "Shawshank Redemption".I also have to give a shout-out to a fairly young Donald Pleasence, who plays Flight Lt. Colin Blythe "The Forger". Okay, maybe not that young, but for those of us who know him from the horror films of the 1980s... (And best of all, Pleasance was an actual POW in a German camp during WWII.) "Great Escape" is humorous, it has characters we actually give a hoot about, and it had a major influence on a lot of later great films: "The Goonies" and "Shawshank Redemption", for example. I wish I could say more about how great this film is... it's really worth a viewing or two.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great thrilling experience....not to be missed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am watching quite a few 'Escape' movies recently and nothing gets better and bigger than this one. Based on a true incident about Allied Prisoner's of War's planning mass escape mission to flee from German POW Camps, this movie takes into account all the pre and post escape incidents. The POW Camp is also known to be escape-prone and it will take something big and special to flee from there. The prisoners present in the camp are also veteran 'escapers' who are given specific jobs for the escape. For example, one is made a 'Forger' who creates false ID's, another one is made the 'Tunnel King' who will plan a tunnel long enough to get out of there . There is also a separate story of Captain Hilts (Mcqueen), an American who at the beginning tries to get out on his own but then joins the rest of them due to circumstances. The movie can be divided in two parts, The initial part shows the planning and digging of the tunnel and the second part shows the post-escape incidents. The second part is stretched a little bit IMO and the editor could have come in handy here.But the movie is a great thrilling experience nevertheless.Steve Mcqueen as the arrogant 'American' is a treat to watch. He has done some daring stunts in the second half where he hasn't used any double. That was really impressive. Richard Attenborough as the leader of the escape team did his job convincingly . Well He can act too The rest of the actors (There are a lot of them) have fit the bill efficiently. Overall, You have missed something if you haven't watched this one.Rating : 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A rousing WWII-era action drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>John Sturges's "The Great Escape" is one of the classic films based around World War II. It is based on the true story of a group of Allied POWs and their attempt to escape a German POW camp designed to hold the most notorious escape artists.The story is an entertaining one and stays surprisingly close to the truth. The characters are composites, the timeline is compressed and there are a few concessions to American audiences but for the most part the story is untouched. The film's nearly three-hour running time doesn't drag at all, either.The cast is a strong one with many recognizable faces. Steve McQueen may be the star but there's strong support from Richard Attenborough, Donald Pleasance and several others. A couple of McQueen's "Magnificent Seven" cohorts join him as well, namely Charles Bronson &amp; James Coburn.Sturges's direction is workmanlike but not particularly worth remarking on. Elmer Bernstein's score, on the other hand, contains one of the most iconic movie themes of all time. Overall, the production shows considerable polish and attention to detail.In the end, the film is an eminently satisfying old-fashioned blockbuster. By the way, if you saw "The Magnificent Seven" and liked it, be advised that this film reunites the director, three of the stars and the composer, resulting in similarly fine results.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A classic but not the best war movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ask anybody of a certain age in the UK to name a war film and it's likely that The Great Escape will be the first mentioned. It's an iconic film that gets an airing on terrestrial TV every Christmas and nearly every public holiday. So to criticise it in anyway would be like telling your kindly ageing grandmother that she smells and her cooking sucks. So I'm going to show The Great Escape the respect it deserves and not be too critical.The Great Escape is based on the true story of a group of Allied prisoners of war who managed to escape from an allegedly impenetrable Nazi prison camp during World War II. At the beginning of the film, the Nazis gather all their most devious and troublesome POWs and place them at a new prison camp, which was designed to be impervious to escapes. Immediately, the prisoners develop a scheme where they will leave the camp by building three separate escape tunnels. Richard Attenborough is the British soldier who masterminds the whole plan, and who commands his motley squad--featuring Charles Bronson as a Polish trench-digging expert, James Garner as an American with a talent for theft, Donald Pleasence as a masterful forger, and Steve McQueen as an American rebel--through the construction of the tunnels and, eventually, their escape This is the first of four Steve Mcqueen films that i tend to review in the near future and is probably his most famous role. To be fair , it's not his most challenging role as regards acting is concerned. As like some of his other films the action scenes are the most memorable ones. His escape attempt from the Germans on a motorbike is the part of the film everyone remembers fondly and quite rightly so. You can see he's having so much fun in the muddy fields with that bike.The Great Escape is nearly three hours long but at no time does it drag. i think that's because of the great cast. Everyone is at the top of their game ( except James Coburn and his peculiar Australian accent) and it was not too often that a film a had such a mix of top British and American actors in one film. Richard Attenborough and Gordon Jackson are the serious players in the escape attempt while Steve Mcqueen and Angus Lennie bring a lighter side to the proceedings.It also has a very memorable and catchy soundtrack that everyone immediately recognises. What is it with films in the sixties and fantastic original soundtracks and why don't movies have them anymore? Being totally honest Stalag Luft III is portrayed more like a holiday camp than a prisoner of war camp but i suppose back it was made in 1963 , a little to close to the end of the war for it to be too brutal.The Great Escape is certainly not the best war film ever made , far from it , but it a great film for all the family to sit down and watch on a rainy Sunday afternoon.8 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pure Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is pure film! Film was supposed to be a way to escape your troubles, and it has evolved beyond it to a form of art. The Great Escape came during the golden age of film, where everything was either pure escapism or beautiful art. Many current film-makers forget both art and escapism and rely on the lowest common denominator to fill their coffers (frankly, I find it remarkable some of the space monkeys can write 10 lines of a pointless review here on IMDb), but The Great Escape is brilliant. It is simple fun, with remarkably good directing and cinematography, especially considering it was filmed in LA. You, the viewer, will get lost and meld with the characters as they are trapped by the Nazis and attempt to escape from the Nazis. All in all, a great film: 10/10. Definitely worth a purchase or rental.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great enough for its time attracting some misplaced criticism</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is of its era and given the Hollywood makeover to be expected of the time and, by today's standards, is a little weak on gritty realism. Yet is has far more accuracy to the real story than is given credit and remains an entertaining romp with a great cast, many displaying very subtle realistic traits of behaviour. Most of the characters are true to real people or are composite representations of such people. Many of the negative comments here pick on rather trite issues and often present so called factual errors that are wrong themselves such as: 1 The prisoners wearing uniforms rather than overalls - they did wear uniforms. 2. The apparent relaxed atmosphere of the "Nazi" camp - not all camps were Auschwitz for goodness sake and the Luftwaffe camps were noted for having remarkably better conditions and allowed plenty of leisure activities and scope for the cleanliness observed (food supplies as in many camps was sporadic but not severe until close to the war's end) 3. The fact that Coburn, Bronson and Garner were included for a American audience (alongside McQueen) playing commonwealth servicemen - only Garner portrayed a "commonwealth" serviceman, and did it rather well, as the Aussie. Garner was a US member of the RAF's Eagle Squadron and Bronson was from Poland Furthermore while no Americans escaped many did in fact work on the tunnels, Bronson's character was principally based on a Canadian who was transferred prior to the escape but artistic licence is OK.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Out you escapees go, through the door or out the window...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Great Escape" works for two reasons; these are two elements that have been argued time and time again, only to come up for air once in a blue moon. This film works, and nearly demands repeat viewings, because director John Sturges has complete and utter confidence in his actors, and secondly, it works because the script is kept so simple that the final act seems to come from nowhere. It is the classic bait-and-switch routine pulled off with such grace and delicacy, that I nearly missed it myself. Sturges makes this feature work because of his cast, his star-studded cast that is bigger than belief, yet so grounded, one would think that this was everyone's first feature. Amazingly, in one film, one can witness the emotion of Charles Bronson, the loyalty of James Garner, the leadership of Richard Attenborough, the fear of Donald Pleasence, the cunning of James Coburn, and finally the patriotism of Steve McQueen. Let me say this again, in ONE film, you can see all of this ? and so much more. Not only do you see these great qualities come out with full force, but each actor works with each other to build a comradery, to make this film work ? there is no stress for screen time, they all are eager to make cinematic magic ? and it shows. One could speak for hours about this cast; it is half of what makes this film work. It is the cast that keeps you glued to your screen. It is the cast that makes you want to view the next minute of the film. It is the cast that holds this film together ? but there is another big part ? the script."The Great Escape" works on the next level because Sturges realizes the simplicity of the script, and he does not let that, well, escape. This film easily could have been a convoluted story about escapees trying to elude Nazis, perhaps a love story mixed in, and that cliché element of a inside man. All of these elements could have been mixed in, but Sturges knew that he had strong enough actors that the audience would have no issues following them till the end. The story is kept simple, because it is the endurance of these men that was meant to shine, not the eruption of cliché events on screen. This 1962 film hit it square on the head, modern cinema cannot seem to grasp the idea that less will create more ? and Sturges saw that with "The Great Escape". Even with a nearly three hour film, it kept my attention throughout because of these two very simple ideas. Strong cast ? simple story.There is nothing negative about this film that I could see. The idea that the Nazis were just there as roadblocks for our escapees was intriguing because typically they are more involved. Thinking of the modern film "Hart's War", which Ferrell and Willis work together to escape a similar situation, we have so many stories of race, trust, and fear working against the story that it turns into a huge blockbuster of a film filled with cliché over cliché, merely to turn a profit. While there are big names broadcasting in this film, it doesn't work like "The Great Escape" because the tones are too dark, the themes seem misleading, and our actors fight, literally fight, for screen time that it all becomes muddled and incohesive. In Sturges film, the light shone during the day, our actors never were hurt, and being thrown in solitary seemed like a fly in the pan. Sturges sense of brevity should not be dismissed, while there was a lacking sense of realism throughout this film, it was forgettable. This is rare for me while watching films, because as this was a non-fiction story, there is a level of realism needed to fully submerge into the film ? but Sturges does something spectacular ? he gives us such great characters, deeply involved within this simple story, that the apathetic Nazis seemed genuine. "The Great Escape" is a flawless film. There are others that could dissect this film bit by bit, but for me, it was nearly three hours of pure entertainment.Overall, I was quite impressed with this big-budget film with big-named stars and the biggest escape known to man. As we move into the summer of blockbuster films, where stars all vie for the top weekend spot, hurdling over others and expectations falling short, this old 1960s film (if re-released today) could rival those like "Hancock", "Indiana Jones" and even "Dark Knight". "The Great Escape" proved that if you have a strong cast, develop a simple story ? allowing your characters to create their own moments, and just have fun with the material handed to, than you will have on your hands an instant classic. Modern films over the years continue to borrow or re-imagine scenes from this film, and that is the highest form of flattery, but it is also a sign that Hollywood has found moments that work, and will do anything in their power to recreate. Aside from the Hollywood recycling bin argument, "The Great Escape" has an amazing ensemble cast which could rival that of "Oceans 11", and the nearly three hours breeze by with the greatest of ease. Again, it is a flawless film. It was a surprise for this first time viewer, and I cannot wait to introduce this feature to others who may have allowed it to fall through the cracks. Sturges has created Hollywood perfection. Watch this movie.Grade: ***** out of *****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first part of The Great Escape shows how the prisoners of a German POW camp in WWII plan their escape by digging tunnels out of the camp. The second half deals with the efforts of the escapees to remain at large from the Gestapo as they attempt to make their way to England and other neutral countries. Both parts are terrific and this is a great action movie.Every character in the film is interesting. Richard Attenborough is the leader of the escape. The main prisoners in the camp are played by Steve McQueen, James Garner, Charles Bronson, Donald Pleasance, James Coburn and David McCallum. The rest of the prisoners and Germans are also well acted. Hannes Messemer plays the prison commandant.Steve McQueen's star charisma is huge in this movie as he steals it just by being on screen. Rent the movie in the widescreen DVD version so you can appreciate the beautiful cinematography and spectacular motorcycle chase scenes.</fullReview>

Mcqueen is at his minimal great here as The Cooler King. Almost leaving the production at one point until Sturges wrote the scene where he is asked to help the resistance (he had some insecurity issues with his acting).

		<fullReview>I cannot dislike The Great Escape, with its great cast, anthem-like music score and of course its attention to detail. The film is brilliantly shot with beautiful cinematography, and of course the music score is great, very iconic. It may be a little annoying to some people, as the theme is repeated over and over again, but there is something triumphant about it so I find it hard not to like it. The script is great, but it is the cast and the attention to detail that sticks in the mind. This escape yarn has everything from collapsing tunnels, probing searchlights to the classic movie image of Hilts attempting to escape to freedom on a motorbike. And then there are the characters, for example we have Donald Pleasence's timid forger, James Garner's smooth-talking scrounger and most obviously Steve McQueen's super cool Captain Virgil Hilts. Garner, Pleasence, James Coburn, Richard Attenborough and Charles Bronson fit their parts perfectly, but for me it is McQueen's movie. Overall, The Great Escape is quite simply great, one of the all time great war movies. 10/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Actually, The Great Escape is a darker, more serious film than that which survives in the collective memory of the British public. A group playing of the fool in the teeth of a grand, humourless German war machine always had the potential to come back and bite.It's that playing of the fool that sells the picture though. The (evenly-split) Anglo-American prisoners of war do everything in their power to rile their captors, culminating in a reasonably successful escape plot. The more outré Americans carry the movie, wisecracking and full of action: Steve McQueen plays softball in the sin bin and Evil Knievel whilst on the run, Bronson and Coburn are equally independent agents, putting the thrills into the third act chase. The British, led by (and with the exception of) Dickie Attenborough and Gordon Jackson seem more content to rest on the laurels of outwitting the dastardly Boche. Exciting and stirring, if possibly a little overlong and of course condemning every international football match to its theme tune by virtue of its popularity. 6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This a very good film about the massive escape from a German concentration camp by prisoner allied officers during World War II. No doubt about it. John Surges was indeed and intelligent director whose best products where in the western genre ("Gunfight at the OK Corral", "The Magnificent Seven")in my opinion. No doubt also that "The Great Escape" reaches the rank of an epic spectacular film and is enjoyable and entertaining. Efficient actors also and a great musical score.However, and as for me, it is perhaps the fact that the story is based on real happenings that sort of limited the script and Sturges usual daring in doing movies; it seems as if the director sort of self control himself in order to go along with the real facts and show the in the most accurate way. In such terms, the film turns out as sort of standard and lacks real impact in all.Don't get me wrong; this is a very good movie no doubt, interesting, entertaining and tense. But I think the focus on the true story and how things really happened gives it a sort of colourful documentary sense that demerits a bit what you expect from a war film of its undenieble level.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I guess we can all call Hollywood to task for its war movies. Until recently, they were pretty sanitized. Did you ever see a John Wayne movie where his buddies were beheaded or dismembered. People die in a nice peaceful way, usually throwing their arms in the air, slinging their guns behind them. We don't even see the wound. When "The Great Escape" came out, this was pretty much the case. The other prisoner of war movie to gain popularity with the general population was "Stalag 17" with Robert Ryan as the bad guy. Does it matter. If we are going to stretch reality anyway, can we make our Germans the way we want them. We can make our allied prisoners experts in various types of demolition and subterfuge. With that understood, we now create a magical effort to fool those bad guys and make a grand escape from the prison camp. The writers did a nice job, building suspense and anticipation. Enough roadblocks are thrown up to make it fun. And, of course, this is a real prison camp with real guards and real bullets. No one should look at the ripoff mentality of "Hogan's Heroes" and think that there is a comparison. As one writer said, the Germans would not have been too happy with what was going on and wouldn't have been so careless and so dumb. Nevertheless, like any adventure movie worth its salt, this is great fun.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Enduring, must see movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on historical evidence, this film gives an entertaining account of life in a German prisoner of war camp and a planned "Great Escape" i.e. all the inhabitants out in one hit.I first saw this film as a young child. It was one of my Dad's favourite movies and stars several of our mutually favourite actors: Charles Bronson, Steve McQueen, Richard Attenborough among them. Almost every time this movie came on TV, I felt compelled to watch. I finally bought the movie on DVD and watch it at least once a year.There is very little to dislike about this film. It suits male and female; a huge age range; it contains drama, comedy and plenty of action; the acting is excellent on the whole. The music is fantastic and a suitable tempo and mood throughout. Even knowing the story's outcome, I am still taken through the gamut of emotions each time I watch it.One bit of trivia: apparently Steve McQueen did the majority of his motorbike stunts (although apparently they wouldn't let him do the one at "the border").</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a great film - make no mistake. But I would like to make a comment about Attenborough. Stevie Q's in-the-end futile bike ride is now part of cinema legend and become iconic, and he sure looks good. However, for me the honours have to go to Richard Attenborough as Sq. Ldr. Bartlett or 'Big X'. I'm going to push the boat out here and say it's his 'iconic' moment on film - even apart from 'Pinky' in 'Brighton Rock'. Attenborough is the driving force of the story. All the other characters are as wooden as the huts (hey, I know it's not Shakespeare) but it's through him that we are reminded that there is a war going on and it's not pretty. We are introduced to all the other various prisoners as a hotchpotch of the usual suspects (so to speak) but before Attenborough even says anything we immediately realise the brutality of the moment..his relief when the Gestapo leave the room is palpable! His conversation with the Senior B.O. is frighteningly stark; he is reminded that for the present the Luftwaffe control Germany's POW camps - not the Gestapo or SS. Big X looks mortified; to him there is no distinction, "we're fighting the bloody lot". It's this refusal on Bartletts part not to forget the reasons for fighting (and in doing so reminding the viewer) that keeps the rest of the film from falling into a litany of comic book capers.And where did Stevie Q's 'Hiltz' ever get it into his brain there was a blind spot in the wire? Did he labour under the belief that Luftwaffe personnel were drafted from the congenitally short-sighted, or did he have inside information that Mr. Magoo's German cousin was on duty in the watchtower that morning?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent...but the history teacher in me could have hoped for just a bit more...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a tough audience for historical films. As a retired history teacher, I often notice when details are wrong--and I am not the sort of person you'd like to go to such a movie with, as I will invariably complain about the historical license the filmmakers took in regard to the facts. Now I sometimes realize that there are times when changing the facts a bit might not be such a bad thing--but too often, the writers just don't seem to care if they get it right. Because of this, I generally love "The Great Escape" as it IS based on a real mass escape and the characters are often based on these actual men. BUT, what I struggle with is the studio's insistence that Americans be included in the cast--though in the actual escape this was NOT the case. What makes it worse is that two of these Americans (Steve McQueen and James Garner) were among the leads in the film--making the event seem like it was planned and executed thanks to the good 'ol USA. Now I love my country, but I love the truth even more and it made me feel bad that the Brits and their Commonwealth members somehow got the short end of this. But, on the other hand, the film does do a very job otherwise when it comes to portraying this period in history.I could review the film at length, but there are countless other reviews on this movie already. The bottom line is that the film has exceptional acting, really fine dialog and is well made throughout--and is clearly one of the best war films can find. Well worth seeing and a film that easily justifies its nearly three hour running time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was careful to read as many reviews here before posting my own opinions,having just watched this film for the first time this weekend.Let's get something straight: I know my history and I know fully well that German treatment of POWs was not to the shocking level of genocide that wascommonly associated with treatment in the concentration camps. So shut upabout how much you think you know (or don't know) about the historicalaccuracies of this film. We're talking about a movie, and thus it's purpose is primarily to entertain. So historical accuracy aside, does the truth necessarily make for a better film?Where was the sense of threat in this movie? Prisoners are allowed to moveabout anywhere they want, throw parties, wear what they want, whip upmoonshine, etc. It's no wonder they had no problem constructing secret tunnels. Nobody was keeping an eye on them to begin with. How hard is it to outsmartthe enemy when they're portrayed as a bunch of knuckleheads anyway? TheGermans are so lax at this camp that the prisoners are seemingly in control of their own surroundings and one wonders why they felt the need to escape at all. McQueen tries to escape and gets caught a number of times, ending up insolitary confinement. He even strikes a few officers from time to time. Others pay for their disrespect and attempts at escape with death, but not good ole' Steve. He gets to throw drinking parties and dropkick a few more soldiers.Bottom line: As inane as Hogan's Heroes, except you knew that the show wassupposed to be a comedy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Where to begin? I guess people like this because it has solid characterizations, and it's a good male bonding story with some action. But it's a sanitized, cartoon-like view of a POW camp that couldn't have possibly existed. People's comments keep saying how "accurate" it is, but I don't know how they know that: Were these reviewers ever in a German POW camp? What POW camp would let prisoners wander around freely with tools? And the guards would be like waiters bringing them milk for tea? And in what POW camp would the prisoners have such privacy, and a lack of restriction on their activities. They have all kinds of secret meetings with no guards in sight. Oh, and the commandant's line about "sitting out the war in comfort" is absurd. These were Nazis, folks, not exactly known for their patience. This whole so-called POW camp looks like some country club.This film absolutely stretches credulity to the limits, making the movie pretty much unwatchable. Oh, and the German accents are Hogan's Heroes-style laughable. The whole thing plays out like a substandard TV movieSorry, this movie absolutely doesn't hold up. </fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this in 1963 and I thought it was too long and very dull. I saw it again on TCM and it was about the same. The bald guy is great, and Ives is pretty cool, but Steve McQueen was badly cast as the rebel of a Yank in the middle of the Brit prisoners plotting a great escape. The motorcycle scenes were lame.They should have made a movie about the great escape from Libby Prison during the Civil War. That's a better story. My ancestor Tom Lashua was one of the escapees!The book The Great Escape was better than the movie. The movie took some major liberties with the true facts. The German commandant was a real marshmallow in this movie. I didn't get that part. Has there ever been anyone in a movie as naive as the nice-guy German guard that 'lost' his wallet to James Garner?"Yo aaams ....up!"The theme song is truly bad and they play it over and over for three hours. I made my great escape when I shut off the TV with 20 minutes left to go.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This has to be one of the best movie of its genre by the great director John Sturges. Based on a true story, this has all the basic archetypes. The cast is truly stellar consisting of great stars and iconic old timers. Steve McQueen is the big headliner and is very cool. But he doesn't overshadow anybody. Seeing the list of amazing talents, everybody had their chance to create compelling characters. James Garner has just as much charm as McQueen. Donald Pleasence has the memorable scene of pretending to see. Then there is a list of award winning actors like Richard Attenborough, and James Coburn. It would be the prison escape movie that others would imitate in the future.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie created the sixties. It is not about Nazis; it's about the Man.Steve McQueen and James Garner lead a great ensemble cast in this great John Sturges directed war movie about an RAF escape attempt from a German POW camp.Outside of the Ocean's movies, there are not many great ensemble movies made these days due to the enormous salaries paid to the stars.It is an escape movie, but it plays like a caper flick. What they are stealing in this case, is their freedom. The setup is extremely complicated and fascinating. Of course, only 76 make it out instead of the planned 250, and not many experience freedom, but it still plays well after all these years.It is well worth watching again and again to see Steve McQueen's attempted escape on a motorcycle.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hardly the great escape!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Great Escape is a film that everybody raves about and looks back at with rose tinted glasses . Having seen this for the first time in 20 years i think this is a good film but maybe overrated simply for the fact the ,one , it is way too long at 2 hours and 45 minutes and secondly there are so many silly moments they could never have happened for real. ***** SPOILER ALERT******** It looked like a holiday camp to me with all the prisoners mixing with each other at any times they wanted. They could treat the guards with distane and could get hold of anything they wanted.Why get shot escaping, just stay there and enjoy it until the war is over. Why put all the top RAF escape's in one camp? Surely you would split them up.The Comandant and guards looked like the most inept German soldiers i have ever seen in a war film. Why call the film the Great Escape ? It was hardly great. only 25 escaped and 50 were shot dead! James Coburn's accent was laughable too. Having said all that the film is still ok but mainly down to the musical score by Elmer Bernstien. The music makes the hair on the back of your neck stand up because it is so rousing. Only one other musical score is better than the Great Escape and that is the one for The Magnificent Seven and that is Elmer Bernstien's work too. Steve Mqueen has an aura about him too that not many actors have ever possesed and it is such a shame that he died when he did. 7 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The motorcycle chase scene with Steve McQueen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The German Army motorcycles used during WWII were BMWs. In the now classic chase scene where Steve McQueen is pursued by many German soldiers, the motorbike ridden by the actor was in actuality a 1950's Triumph! It was really a British twin motorcycle disguised to look like a vintage 1940's German Army BMW motorbike! The vehicles used by the Germans were real vintage 1940's cars, trucks &amp; motorcycles which were repaired to working order to add realism to the script. You can find this information among the many extras in the latest DVD version of The Great Escape re-released in 2004 as a special collector's edition of the movie. You can find it at Best Buy. That's were I bought my copy and also that's were I happen to work! Enjoy it! By the way, I also own and ride a 1997 Triumph Thunderbird and so I've done much research about the Triumph Motorcycle company.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Of course our sensabilities are much different now than they were in 1963, but even so this otherwise entertaining flick suffers from a lack of invidiousness in a Nazi POW camp. I was never in one so I can't say for sure, but I suspect that the prisoners weren't alotted the freedom that these folks were in the film (especially since this is supposedly the camp where they gathered all the recalcitrant escapee-manques). Though the picture is overall and enjoyable one, that salient lack of verismilitude is hard to ignore. At least now I know where Hogan's Heroes got its inspiration.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How great was that escape?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's one thing you have to ask yourself about The Great Escape. That is whether that escape actually was so great. Was all the effort worth it? The film tells the more or less true story of British prisoners in a World War II German POW camp. The prisoners considered it their duty to try and escape, to confound and harass the enemy. But what would it take to consider the operation a success? The plan was to bust out 250 prisoners. Sounds great. But it wasn't as simple as digging a tunnel and popping up on the other side of the fence a free man. Once you exit the tunnel you're in Nazi Germany with the Gestapo hot on your heels. For all the incredibly hard work that went into the digging of the tunnel getting out of the camp was always going to be the easy part. Getting out of Germany was the hard part. And for all the meticulous planning that went into that part of the operation there was always the sense that might be a hill too high to climb. And if that effort failed the consequences would be dire. Was it all worth it? Was it really such a great escape after all? For as much as the men found it their duty to attempt to escape the fact was that they weren't really that bad off as prisoners. The camp in which they were imprisoned was not the typical Nazi house of horrors you would expect. The prisoners were actually treated pretty well. The camp commandant seemed rather sympathetic to their plight. Should they escape the Gestapo who would be responsible for hunting them down would be much less sympathetic. But escape they must decide the prisoners. And thus begins a rather incredible effort. It's so much more than digging a tunnel. Everyone had a job to do and everyone did it well. You can question whether the prisoners really should have tried to escape in the first place but there is no denying that once they set their mind to it the effort they put in was remarkable. It was always going to be an overly ambitious plan. 250 men coming out of the tunnel and finding their way to freedom? Never going to happen. What would constitute success? Everyone can have their own opinion on that. But it is hard to see how whatever could be gained was worth what in the end could be lost.So maybe the escape itself wasn't as great as we, or certainly the escapees themselves, would have hoped. But what about the movie? Again, a noble effort but not as great as you'd hope. One problem comes with Hollywood getting its hands on a true-life story and changing it to suit the needs of Hollywood. Enter Steve McQueen because an American audience demands an American star. Even if in the true story there really was no such person as McQueen's Captain Hilts. Even if in the real history all the Americans had already been moved out of the camp by the time the escape happened, let's send James Garner through the tunnel too. Garner's character at least blends into the story well. McQueen on the other hand seems to be acting in his own little movie. All the effort to give the big American star something to do, to give him some big dramatic moments detracts from the film. The character of Hilts is portrayed as the big hero. The real heroes of the story get the short shrift. Richard Attenborough, playing the leader of the escape efforts, gets plenty of screen time. But so many other characters who seemingly had a lot to offer get pushed into the background as the Steve McQueen show plays out. A shame. It's not that McQueen gives a bad performance because he surely doesn't. It's just that his character was forced into the movie and never quite fits. Not to mention the fact that all the time spent with McQueen stretches out the running time of an already notably long film. With all that went into the preparations for the escape this was always going to be a long one. Toss the character of Hilts into the mix and you've got a movie which goes on so long that it often struggles to maintain its momentum. But at least you know you have the escape to look forward to and when it comes it is undeniably dramatic. And then the tension really kicks in. What will be the ultimate fate for all of these brave men? The movie's ending packs an emotional wallop. Ultimately, and unfortunately, it comes back to McQueen. He gets the show-off motorcycle ride he demanded. And his character gets the last word so to speak. Which is a shame because the real story provided more than enough real heroes to choose from. Add it all up and this is a movie which had the potential to be great. But it comes up a few yards short.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Overrated But Entertaining American Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This came third in Channel 4's recent 100 GREATEST WAR MOVIES poll a few months ago which did rather surprise me since I've always found it somewhat overrated but it does remain a fairly entertaining American movie Yes THE GREAT ESCAPE is an American movie and I'm glad that the IMDb classes it so . It's directed by an American , is produced and financed by an American studio and most ironic of all the theme tune that is adopted and chanted by English football fans was written by the American composer Elmer Bernstien . It may contain many British actors but notice also the likes of Garner , Bronson and Coburn playing British Commonwealth characters which is down to what's known as " Audience identification " ie if a movie is made with American money the Yanks want their movie to do well in America hence nearly every " British " movie you see has a major character played by an American actor As for the story itself everyone has seen the movie ( We in Britain get to see it almost once a year usually at Xmas ) so I won't linger on it too long except to say it comes in what can only be described as two parts . The first part centres on the build up of the escape with the movie's tongue firmly in its cheek ( Werner the stupid German , man jumps on bunk and it collapses etc ) with the prisoners on the run making up the second part of the story which is more serious in tone . Also watch out for the ironic scene early in the film where a character chastises someone for replying in English to a question in German as the escapees plan their escape with the character later on making the same mistake himself . Who says Americans have irony deficiency ?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An almost great film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Great Escape has all the elements needed for a great Hollywood film, but it falls short of perfection. The acting, direction, photography, and especially the music are all compelling, but the script comes up short. It is very difficult to believe that prisoners of war would constantly be so cavalier about everything. The film creates a bunch of fun but ultimately trivial characters that inhabit an all-too-unreal prison camp. While they cover slightly different ground, Grand Illusion and Stalag 17 both are superior films for presenting a more balanced view of prison life. In spite of the poor script and silly characterizations, the film does have many merits. The European locations are wonderful and look fantastic. The score is riveting. And the cast provides an informative glimpse into Hollywood, 1963. This is one of the last great studio action films. Soon, films that some of the stars of this film are in, like Bullit and Death Wish, would replace the WWII film as the action/adventure standard. The world was moving forward, away from the patriotism and myth that surrounded the second war. The great legacy of this film is that it provides one last look back into that lost world and shows why it was so compelling to Americans. Soon after the film's release, JFK would be dead and Vietnam would be reality. The Great Escape could not have been made in 1969.</fullReview>

This may be fine for a Speilberg/Lucas action vehicle, but these events took place in a POW camp--no laughing matter.The one scene that truly turned me off was when Steve McQueen 'pick pocketed' the keys for the prison door from the German guard. When he smugly returns them to the guard, the soundtrack is polluted with appropriate 'whimsical' music.This film does not live up to its legend. Watch 'Escape from Alkatraz instead.6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In point of fact, the film used one of the camp's most heroic prisoners (the Tunnel King played by Charles Bronson) as an adviser. However, the truth is there was no such character/person as Capt. Hilts. Steve McQueen's character never existed. The famed motorcycle chase in the film never happened. It is true that thousands of Germans (not "millions", as actor Charles Coburn later told during the film's Special Features interview) were used to track down the 76 (not 79) who escaped. Also, Hitler had initially ordered the execution of 100 prisoners, including the 76 who escaped, but was talked into executing 50, instead.One of the best sites for the truth on the various Allied POW camps and what happened to the men in these camps as the Russians and American armies advanced is found at http://www.b24.net/pow/march.htm. There is video and audio mp3 files from Col. Von Lindeiner and many others from Luft III. The most gripping of all the accounts from these camps however is The Death March from Luft IV in Eastern Prussia. That can be seen at http://www.b24.net/pow/march.htm.

		<fullReview>Realizing that I was not supposed to accept `The Great Escape' as High Art, I found it to be an entertaining film. The story about a group of hard-scrabble soldiers in a German P.O.W. camp who are rounded up and thrown together because they are the prisoners who have attempted escape the most, is not deep in the slightest, and fairly formulaic, (I was able to announce the ending of the film, music, dialogue and all, about ten minutes before the actual end) but enjoyable nonetheless.One thing that I enjoyed knowing while watching the film was that the director, John Sturges, not only is the director of one of those other `manly man classic' films, `The Magnificent Seven', but the director of the god-awful Gene Hackman film, `Marooned' that was so gleefully torn apart on Mystery Science Theater 3000. I guess for every few good films, you can be allowed a stinker. That's only one of the many lessons I learned watching `The Great Escape', however. Among the many things I learned as I enjoyed this film were that James Coburn should never attempt an Australian accent, that Charles Bronson was unbelievably buff in 1963, and Steve McQueen always looked 43 years old. `The Great Escape' is a good film and deserves its place on the IMDB top 250 list, but it certainly has a core audience, and while I truly enjoyed the film, I'm not really a member of that core audience. I liked it enough to appreciate it and give it a good review once, but I don't think I'll be sneaking this one into the DVD player in the next five years. Certainly not because of the film making itself, or the plot, which was good, it's just one of those `watch it one time and leave it at that' films for me personally.--Shelly</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Great Escape</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is best known as one of everyone's favourite war films, not just for the actors but the thought of hope and escape, based on a true story. It is basically all about prisoners in a German PoW (Prisoner of War) camp trying everything they can to escape, e.g. hiding in trucks with trees in them, dressing as Russians being released, and many other attempts. Then everyone has the idea of a tunnel, but to make certain they can still escape, they make three tunnels in different locations with different names. Eventually after long hours of digging, keeping quiet, and diversions, they do manage to succeed in getting at least 70 men out, but some are killed, and the ending is a very amusing one. Starring Steve McQueen as Capt. Virgil 'The Cooler King' Hilts (most of the motorbike sequence is really him), James Garner as Flight Lt. Bob Anthony 'The Scrounger' Hendley, Lord Sir Richard Attenborough as Squadron Leader Roger 'Big X' Bartlett, James Donald as Group Capt. Rupert 'The SBO' Ramsey, Charles Bronson as Flight. Lt. Danny 'The Tunnel King' Velinski, Donald Pleasence as Flight Lt. Colin 'The Forger' Blythe, James Coburn as Flying Officer Louis 'The Manufacturer' Sedgwick and Gordon Jackson as Flight Lt. Sandy MacDonald (Intelligence). It was nominated for the Oscar for Best Film Editing, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Drama . Steve McQueen was number 14 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, he was number 49 on The 100 Greatest Sex Symbols, he was number 62 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons, and he was number 43 on The World's Greatest Actor, Lord Sir Richard Attenborough was number 34 on The 50 Greatest British Actors, the film was number 19 on 100 Years, 100 Thrills, it was number 53 on The 100 Greatest Family Films (although the list may be confused with Bean), it was number 3 on The 100 Greatest War Films, and it was number 39 on The 100 Greatest Films.

		<shortDescription>Dull, fad following, cliché of a flop</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is about a massive escape from a German prison camp. Unlike the fast paced and intriguing "Stalag 17", this movie is plodding, dull, and yet no more realistic. Everyone looks squeaky clean, which already makes it lack any of the realism of the Holden-Brand classic.A lot of big name stars are in this, led by the contemplative Richard Attenborough. The film tries to draw us into the lives of James Garner and Steve McQueen, but loses us terribly. Every war cliché is in this movie. And the director probably caved in to McQueen's insistence upon the use of motor vehicles, giving us another stupid, boring motorcycle chase no one cares about, except McQueen's red neck club. Even Garner has to get into the driving act by somehow getting a German plane. So much for realism. To top it off, we are treated to the usual cliché of kill the nearsighted man, Hollywood's favorite whipping post, and the subject of heinous prejudice unequaled.You really have to plod through this ordeal. You won't really care about anything or anyone, and will try to occasionally watch between around the house chores, but don't bother. It isn't worth it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How did he get to Switzerland?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So the whole thing takes place in Poland, they escape, and end up in Switzerland? How on earth did Steve McQueen get there? The only thing I figure is that they wanted a more picturesque backdrop for the motorcycle scene, which works for nice scenery, however what lacks is historical validity and logical scene sequence, both of which are clearly compromised here.If anyone knows why on earth this movie is filmed in Switzerland, I'd like to know.Thanks, Peter</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It´s not a war movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film shows us nothing from the brutal II world war but a true story well packed with adventure touch. The plan for the great escape was very clever. MGM created a very good picture but the story was too long. I think it became a classic because this true story has been played very convincing by legendary stars like Steve McQueen, Charles Bronson, James Garner, Gordon Jackson, Donald Pleasence etc. In the first part of the movie it happens not much but the the second part was full of suspense and action. If you like war/adventure movies i recommend you to watch this one. The vote is too overrated. I give maximum 7/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is shown all the time on the history station in Canada. It is not a bad movie. It is long, but interesting to watch. The cast was strong. It is a bit dated. It is a true story. I wonder how accurate the movie was to the book. 6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not such a great escape</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Loosely based on the true story of 70-odd American, British, and other allied prisoners of war who escaped from jail to deliberately throw confusion on Germany and divert troops from the front lines. Top cast of character actors makes the most of all the scenes and the action is good, so one doesn't tend to notice the film's excessive length too much. Lots of thought went into making the film relatively inoffensive to the European market, even including sympathetic Germans and courageous Frenchmen, cheapening the film's realism.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A POW camp more comfortable than many 3 star motels.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Even conceding the fact that this POW camp was run by the Luftwaffe and not the SS this has got to be the silliest representation of a POW camp ever put to film and I include "Hogan's Heroes" in this statement. At least "Hogan's Heroes" admitted it was a comedy. After viewing the Germans represented in this piece of malarkey I am surprised World War II lasted 6 months. I remember wondering when I first saw this as a teenager why the Germans would allow a person in solitary confinement to have games to play. Now I know 39 years later; they wouldn't. Considering how heroic the actual events really were it is shame to see them made to look so cartoonish in this vehicle for Steve McQueen. Good thing for him the German's didn't know what was being planned in all those private POW rooms available to those crazy flyboy prisoners. I noticed on the DVD box someone called it the greatest World War II movie ever made. If it is then I guess the WW II veterans I talked to were really embellishing how tough it was. I am not completely panning this movie because it is fun to see some very good performers in their younger years (I gave it 5 out of 10). However, having seen this movie in 1964 and in 2002 I can't say it has aged well at all. I suspected it was a sanitized piece of propaganda in 1964 and am quite sure of it now.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tension and urgency</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The great escape, with all of its fame, winds up being quite a disappointment for me. There is just no emotional attachment to any of the characters from this movie. The Germans allow the prisoners wonder around, the whole prison camp feel more like a summer camp than a WWII prison camp. The work camp in the movie "holes" was 10 times tougher on its residents than this prison camp, and that was only a juvenile correctional camp. The entire movie seem to be constructed to build the "hero" characters portrayed by McQueen. There're so many people here proclaim this is Steve McQueen's best work. Well I am not very familiar with Steve McQueen, but his acting job, while completely competent, sure is nothing to write home about. The entire movie is unnecessarily lengthy and drawn out while at the same time completed devoid of the spirit of the brave men keeping their fight going even under imprisonment. It feels more like a teen schemed, prank fest than a epic tale of heroism. Someone here stated this is as much of a WWII movie as "Saving Private Ryan". I say comparing this movie to saving private Ryan is like comparing a Saturday morning cartoon to Shakespeare.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>wildly overrated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't understand why so many people love this movie. There is nothing great about this escape. Since a majority of POWs who escaped were recaptured or killed, the title is misleading. I'm not saying every film should have a happy ending, but how about featuring the people who actually got away. If you think about it, escaping from a POW camp and getting recaptured at the end after following the details of the escape for nearly three hours is a bit of a cheat. This is one of those films that should have not been historically accurate. As reading previous reviews I have read, the movie was unrealistic as it was they might as well gone all the way with it. This mix of historical accuracy and Hollywood doesn't mix together very well. A disappointing 5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Silly Hollywood fluff</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A silly, silly movie. I rented it based upon the rave reviews on this site, and only sat through until the end so I could add my own review. I love war movies, but this thing was a combination of "Hogan's Heroes" and "Gilligan's Island". I should have known by the goofy little theme song in the beginning that it was just a piece of Hollywood fluff, circa 1963. I find it truly hard to believe that others have rated it highly.My main problem with the film is that everybody and everything is a Hollywood cliche or stereotype. The camp guards spend the movie ignorantly staring into space while the escape plan magically develops before them, and the Commandant is downright sympathetic to the plight of his prisoners. And why were they trying to escape, anyways? I lost track of the number of scenes showing clean, healthy, well fed, well groomed "prisoners" sitting around smoking pipes in their sweaters, fer cryin' out loud! And the camp itself looked like an upscale hunting lodge during a comfortable summer. Imagine a 3 hour Nazi prison movie without one single unpleasant scene! This movie is nothing less than an insult to anyone that managed to survive a Nazi camp, and the millions that didn't. Heck, I look worse after a good night's sleep than these "prisoners" did after 20 days in solitary. I always wondered where the idea came from to make a TV sit-com about a WWII German P.O.W. camp (Hogan's Heroes). After seeing this completely unbelievable waste of time I now know. If you want a good WWII movie rent "Patton" or "Saving Private Ryan". This thing is just a bad comedy. I would give it a "3" out of "10". Maybe they should have added a laugh track.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why were the Canadians not mentioned?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It has come to my attention that the whole reason the escape happened was because of some very smart and resourceful Canadians. Yet there is no mention of Canadians in the movie. Why is that? No seriously, why were the Canadians not mentioned? If not for Canadians the Great Escape would not have happened. "Tom, Dick and Harry" were the making of some amazing Canadians and no one knows because the movie never mentioned them. I think this is appalling. Henry Birkland, Wally Floody and Tommy Thompson are heroes and great Canadians and I, among others, did not know their names until watching a documentary on the great escape. It is a shame that Canadians have been so downplayed in the role of winning the wars that have occurred in our past. I am a proud Canadian and the more I learn about the war and our role in them, the more I realize that Canadians have been largely unmentioned. We played a huge role in winning these wars and our soldiers deserve an honorable mention. To all our soldiers, I say thank you and god bless.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It doesn't provide the greatness it could have</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*****Classic ****Excellent ***Good **Fair *Tragic Review:The Great Escape is a blatant and obvious Steve McQueen war film that doesn't punch all the punches correctly. The tedious and untimely draw-backs to McQueen visiting his detention cell just get more boring and frustrating as you watch. The never ending and pointless 'walk about' around the concentration camp scenes become tiresome and forgetful. Although 'Escape' is layered with world-renowned actors, it still is placed with an of form Steve McQueen and blabby acting.Director John Sturges tries to layer all this substance that doesn't work and by the end you feel like he's committed a common and severe crime that you wonder and ask yourselves- why put me through this"?Verdict:Despite the backup of some great actors (excluding McQueen) you can only help but beg for mercy for it to end.*Tragic</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is 2005, more than forty years after the movie was made. I would say the major difference between this and modern films is the way the prisoner of war camp seemed to be more like a cheap motel, with lots of privacy for the prisoners, seemingly pretty nice Germans in charge (granted, they were wearing blue, so it may have been a WWII Grand Illusion interplay), easy to get supplies for the escape. But everything was just too easy, again something of the sixties films. The movie was really about temperamental conflicts while building the tunnel, but these were based on stereotypes of characters, not real emotional differences. But, it's a classic, so I watched more of it than I really should have.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I bought the dvd after reading how great it was here on imdb. Well, I must say, Im glad it only cost me 13$. The acting was bad and so was the score. A thru and tragic story ruined by Hollywood. Did not feel anything for the caracters. I belive the experinece of it was more dramatic, tragic and sad than the movie got to tell. Very bad storytelling.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Over rated action/drama WW 2 escape film that suffers from extreme HOLLYWOOD formula watering down directng style.The acting was good but the soundtrack was very condescending and the atmosphere had no grit at all.All this was done on purpose by the film makers though as they targeted a more artistically challenged GENERAL AUDIENCE crowd.A how to for DISNEY STYLE war films.The result is a movie that had potential to be a MASTERPIECE CLASSIC but merely achieves a good rating.Also,blatant script inconsistensies can be very irritating to intelligent people, like Charles Bronson masterfully digging incredible tunnels like a super human Mole,then all of a sudden inexplicably turns into a CLAUSRTROPHOBIAC for over dramatic effect?!Please!If you want a great WW 2 escape film,check out BRIDGE OVER THE RIVER KWAI,VICTORY or STALAG 17 for that matter........</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Leslie Nielsen movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie is absolutely ridiculous. The most overrated piece of art of all time.Let me tell you something. Unless you are British, you are going to hate this absolute dog of a film. And the British love it, just because a super-cool guy like Steve McQueen hangs out with the British folks and also for the main theme (let's all chant!).Accurate? German WW2 POW camp? Sounds more like summer camp to me! These people are caught trying to escape and the Nazis just take them by the hand to get them back in line. And they still wear their uniforms, not some prison overalls -which is the first thing the Germans would do: take off their pride. It's a joke really! Let me be more specific: the English (and the one American) can do WHATEVER they want in this camp, while the Nazis are just waiting for someone to escape in order to get them back in prison. And what about those secret meetings! The Germans were minding their own business, while the POWs were designing plots to escape. Yeah, right!Apart from all that, the movie is boring, not going anywhere. No acts of heroism, no surprises, no script, no women.I wouldn't care for the story if at least there was some realism in this horrible movie, but a parody is all you get. If instead of McQueen it was Leslie Nielsen, we would have a great comedy.0/10 (what a joke!)</fullReview>
