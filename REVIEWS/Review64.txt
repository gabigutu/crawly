		<shortDescription>Excellent Start but did not carry all the way!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was a bit hesitant to watch this one but my GF insisted and hence the review. I was quite surprised with the initial plot which was a bit mysterious and had a touch of fantasy to it. The acting was great and I was really enjoying it but half way through the movie they just threw everything away.The plot just gets weird around the last quarter of the movie and seemed like either the director was in a rush to wrap everything up and go home or one of the actors wanted to quit early or something. It just felt incomplete, leaving you with tons of questions and a poker face wondering what just happened .....</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film starts pretty good. The atmosphere is very early set, characters are introduced, and they all do a pretty good and convincing job - albeit with the occasional cliché (but you can overlook that).The problem of the main character is revealed about one third into the movie, and then the solution starts. But, I don't know what exactly happened, perhaps they lost all their money, but in no time and for no good reason it just ends. there is no build up, no explanation given, it just ends. half of the introduced mysteries of the movie are not explained.so you leave the cinema with a film that wasn't finished, and as such, only a 4/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Start, Horrible End</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This could have been a really good movie. Although the movie has "Sleeping Beauty" in the title and there is a female that has been asleep for centuries awaiting a kiss; that is where the similarities to the traditional Sleeping Beauty end. The movie provides a great spin on the traditional fairy tale of Sleeping Beauty. The premise is that male bloodline of the Kaiser family has been the caretaker of sorts for the secrets surrounding the Sleeping Beauty. The characters are interesting and meld together very well. The movie progresses along very well and the story line does a very good job of keeping your attention up until the last 15 or so minutes and then it takes a nose-dive into, well, I guess hell. I can't believe someone, anyone, really sat there and said, "Hell yeah, that ending nailed it! Let's release the movie now before we change our minds."Do I regret watching it? No. Would I recommend someone else watch it? Yes and No. If you have nothing else on your playlist or you're sitting in the hotel room at night by yourself flipping through the channels looking for something to watch, then, by all means, yes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was debating weather to watch this but I did....i agree on some of the reviews people have wrote but from my point of view...we do find out the truth of it all (the twist of it all being a trick to unleash the demon and all the other spooky stuff being there to ward off people from getting to the final chamber), but The end seemed very quick from the climax.They could be a second movie to it. and it should will delved into the mystery of the house, and how it became evil with in. Plus I wish we knew more about sleeping beauty and how she became trapped in the dream/ state</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'THE CURSE OF SLEEPING BEAUTY': Two and a Half Stars (Out of Five)Another B-horror flick based on a classic Brothers Grimm fairy tale. This one is a dark modern update of 'Sleeping Beauty' (written by the Brothers Grimm and Charles Perrault); it deals with an art painter, who inherits an ancient curse (which involves dreams of a 'sleeping beauty'). The film was directed by Pearry Reginald Teo; and it was scripted by Teo and first time feature film writer Josh Nadler (based on the comic book by Everette Hartsoe). It stars India Eisley, Ethan Peck, Natalie Hall and Bruce Davison. The movie received harshly negative reviews from critics, and a large percentage of viewers as well. I hated it at first; but then I grew to enjoy it more, as it went on.The story centers around an art painter, named Thomas Kaiser (Peck), who keeps having dreams of a beautiful sleeping woman (Eisley). He continuously tries to wake her, but is unsuccessful. Thomas later learns of his uncle's suicide, and the mansion he left him; which had been in his family for generations. While investigating the property, for appraisal reasons, Thomas also learns of an ancient curse there, and his role as the 'protector'. He must keep the demons in his new home imprisoned there, while also trying to awake the sleeping beauty. He finds help from a friendly realtor (Hall), and a paranormal investigator (Davison).For the first 45-minutes of the movie, I was completely bored (and falling asleep). The acting and writing were atrocious; and the film was really repetitive, and uninvolving. Then, about halfway through the movie, it got a lot more interesting, and entertaining. Once it got to the story, it became filled with more tense, and very gruesome, imagery (and stunningly beautiful women). At that point, I enjoyed it a lot more. It's still mostly a bore, and a misfire, but a sequel could be a lot better (which the end is completely set up for).Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/lcZBQp0HBZg</fullReview>
