		<shortDescription>Well, I enjoyed it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some people really need to get over themselves, judging by some of the reviews for this film. It is a fantasy based on children's stories - what the hell were they expecting, Hamlet or Henry V? It was a fun ride with plenty of action, plenty of humour, and a great cast - Chris Hemsworth brings his usual cheery action hero to the mix, Jessica Chastain was a good addition as The Huntsman's wife, and Emily Blunt played the fragile Ice Queen wonderfully well. The Dwarfs were comic relief as always, but it worked well with fewer of them and a couple of females in the mix.The story wasn't overcomlicated but if I want that, I'll go watch Memento. Chill out a little, folks.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A slick and enjoyable fantasy romp, let down by a muddled plot and basic dialogue.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Huntsman: Winter's War is great fodder for fans of the genre; the slenderly plotted film moves along at a nice pace and the cast do a decent job with what they're given. Although it's undoubtedly a cash-grab sequel (do not believe the "before Snow White" marketing), it manages to argue its case for existing fairly well. Contractual obligations aside, Hemsworth and Theron resume their roles with great gusto, with Hemsworth arguably vastly improving on his performance in the first film. Throw in Emily Blunt and Jessica Chastain and you're confronted with a pretty enviable - if surprising - cast for a film of this level.The basic driving plot of the film is centred on Eric's (the previously anonymous Huntsman from the first outing) dubiously arranged quest to locate and return the powerful magic mirror, before it falls into the wrong (icy) hands. Accompanied by some foul-mouthed dwarfs, the scenes in the forests and fields are probably some of the better sequences in the film, if only for their tonal consistency rather than their originality. These portions of the film focus on action and comedy, and the camaraderie comes across well enough.This quest is framed at both the start and end of the film by a strange and rather hastily delivered - yet nonetheless enjoyable - story of two sisters and a sad betrayal. Ravenna (Theron) and Freya (Blunt) are supposedly the closest of siblings who become parted by a very dark event that awakens a great power within Freya. Fleeing her sister's kingdom in a mix of despair, anger and confusion, Freya sets up home in the mysterious "North" and uses her new strength to gather children to train as her army. It is here that the two stories are tied together, with stolen children Eric and Sara (Chastain) growing to become two of her trusted Huntsmen. The scenes in the North are mostly effective and judiciously used; the muted colour palette here isn't allowed to become boring, and this mini saga is undoubtedly uplifted by Blunt's delicate performance. If you have seen the trailers for this film and are keen to experience the full thing, go in with realistic expectations and you'll have a fun two hours; I am certain that the vast majority of prominent critics will despise this film, but it wasn't made for them. Yes, it's a patchwork production of popular elements from other sources and is generally a rather campy affair, but that's what makes it such an inoffensive and entertaining film. There is plenty to like here, if you give it a chance.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Long before her death, the sorceress Ravenna learns that her younger sister Freya is not only engaged in an illicit affair with the Duke of Blackwood, but is carrying his child, who is destined to become fairest of them all. Sometime after Freya gives birth to a baby girl, she discovers that the Duke has murdered their child and, in a grief-fueled rage, kills him with her long-suppressed ice powers.Freya abandons the kingdom and builds herself a solitary ice palace deep in the north, murdering anyone who opposes her while amassing an army of children and training them so their hearts will be forever hardened. Eric and Sara, two of her most exceptional warriors, fall in love and plan to elope, only to learn that Freya is aware of their secret. She confronts them and creates a massive ice wall to separate them before forcing Eric to watch as Sara is killed by her fellow huntsmen.Seven years after Ravenna's death, King William of Tabor comes across Eric and informs him that the Magic Mirror was taken while en route to a place known as "Sanctuary". Eric reluctantly sets off with Nion and Gryff, two of Snow White's allies, to find the Mirror, unaware that Freya has been secretly observing their conversation through a mask that projects her consciousness in the form of a white owl.While en route, the trio are attacked by a legion of Freya's huntsmen but are rescued by Sara, who is revealed to have been alive the entire time. She reveals her death was a vision conjured by Freya in order to trick him and that she was forced to watch as "Eric" ran away from the palace. Eric reveals that he never stopped loving Sara and the two agree to work together. Sometime later, the quartet is ensnared in a trap laid out by female dwarfs Bromwyn and Doreena, but convince them to help find the Mirror.The group reaches the Sanctuary, and they defeat the goblins who possess the Magic Mirror only to be ambushed by Freya, who reveals Sara was using them the entire time. In the chaos that follows, Nion and Doreena are turned into ice statues and Sara reluctantly fires an arrow into Eric's chest. Freya departs with the Mirror, unaware that Sara intentionally shot the arrow at a medallion she gave Eric long before, and that he is still alive.Meanwhile, Freya approaches the Mirror and recites a spell that causes a golden liquid to emerge and transform into Ravenna, who reveals she sent her spirit into the Mirror before Snow White took her life.Meanwhile, Eric has infiltrated the icy kingdom with help of Gryff and Bromwyn, and he attempts to murder Freya, but is stopped by Ravenna. When Freya realizes that Sara hadn't actually killed Eric, she corners her and because of Ravenna's wishes, sentences them both to death. However, Eric is able to convince a few huntsmen to fight against Ravenna and Freya, claiming the love of brethren. After this, Ravenna kills many huntsmen, and Freya forms an ice wall between the huntsmen and the sisters. As the remaining huntsmen climb over the wall, the two sisters argue over the icy kingdom, during which Freya discovers that Ravenna cursed the Duke of Blackwood into murdering her child rather than risk someone being more beautiful than her. Freya is filled with anger at this and turns against her sister, joining forces with Eric and Sara. Freya is fatally wounded, but not before she freezes the magic mirror, as Eric throws his axe, breaking the mirror and destroying Ravenna's spirit. As she dies, Freya witnesses Eric and Sara together and states they were "lucky" before succumbing to her wounds.As the kingdom's inhabitants and huntsmen celebrate their victory, a mysterious golden bird flies overhead, hinting that possibly Ravenna's spirit still lives.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than the previous one</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't know why people complain about this one. I went in expecting a fantasy romp with beautiful but evil queens ... and that's exactly what I got! In spades! The other thing that stood out is that the actors are all top shelf. For guys like me, seeing *three* of the most gorgeous actresses appear together (Emily Blunt, Charlize Theron, Jessica Chastain) in a movie is a feast for the eyes. And they all can act! The supporting cast is great (bunch of awesome British guys) as well. The dialog is light- hearted and the love story believable. On top of all this, the story is pretty linear and makes sense. (In a fairy tale-way, of course, but what do you expect?) Most surprisingly, I did feel emotionally attached to the characters. Each had clear motivations and I felt for their plight. Lovers get separated then reunited, a mother loses a child and something snaps inside her, an evil queen wants revenge and power.Overall, I can only recommend this movie. You won't get bored for a second and might even get emotional by the end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Ice Queen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The evil Ravenna (Charlize Theron) finds that he sister Freya (Emily Blunt) is pregnant and in love with a noble. Freya gives birth to a baby girl but her beloved lover murders the baby and her rage unleashes ice powers and she kills him. Freya heads to North and builds a palace and an army that captures children from the villages to be raised as soldiers without love. Years later, their children Eric (Chris Hemsworth) and Sara (Jessica Chastain) are grown-up and in love with each other. They plan to flee from the castle, but Freya finds and builds an ice wall between them. Eric sees Sara being murdered stabbed on her back by their friend Tull (Sope Dirisu) and he is dumped in a frozen river but he survives. Eric, a.k.a. The huntsman grieves the death of his beloved Sara on a daily basis. One day, Snow White is ill and her husband seeks out Eric to tell that the Magic Mirror was taken while carried to a place called Sanctuary. Eric teams-up with two dwarfs to find the mirror, but they are attacked by Freya army and saved by Sara that is alive. She tells that she saw Eric leaving her alone, and he concludes that Freya gave different visions for each of them. They retrieve the mirror but Sara betrays Eric and Queen Freya and her army takes the mirror and captures the group. Then she asks Sara to kill Eric and she follows the order. Whal will happen now that Freya has the magic mirror?"The Huntsman: Winter's War" is an entertaining fantasy full of action with great cast and special effects. The plot is a prequel of "Snow White and the Huntsman" with Ravenna and the Huntsman, and introducing Freya and Sara. The film may not be recommended by professional critics but fortunately I am amateur. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): "O Caçador e a Rainha do Gelo" ("The Huntsman and the Ice Queen")</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It is so bad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I guess I should review this snoozefest while am motivated to waste even more of my time on it. First off, I did not watch the first film so I can not compare the two films. After this one, I'm not planning on ever watching the first Huntsman movie. Anyway, the biggest problem I have with the film is the predictability. The movie was so predictable that I literally knew what the story narrator was going to say before he said it. And why they do you need someone narrating the first 20 minutes of a 2 hour movie anyway? I'll tell you why, because it sucks. Oh, and I need to talk about Jessica Chastain. Jessica Chastain's accent is AWFUL! She sounded like an American doing an exceptionally bad impression of a Scotsman. Isn't Jessica Chastain an award winning actress? I know she did this movie for a paycheck but at the very least she could have pretended like she was taking the role seriously. But yeah, I'm not over exaggerating. Her accent was so laughable and goofy that I had to laugh the one second her voice went low and her American accent came out. But this movie was a lost cause before Jessica Chastain even came on screen. The action isn't nearly enough and the movie isn't even worth watching for the action anyway! If this sounds like a partial review of the movie, that is because it is. I stopped watching after 20 minutes. Time is something you can not get back and I didn't want to waste another second on this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Emily blunt is awesome, Great film, vast improvement over the first film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Likes : I'm glad to say this is an improvement over the last film entitled snow white &amp; the huntsmen , would i say its a 12A - pg13 not really , there are moment in this film special with the banter it does take a turn in the adult humour which is a little over the certification the film got which i would say this film is 15 cert tops but funny moments that will make you laugh.The story is pretty good although some moment i did feel the film felt off but most of the rest of film is well play out , even the concept worked for the film which is a good thing because this time its a little more darker then before , i would say a little emotional there are a few scene that can bring you to tears.The film is kind of clever in a way using the prequel / sequel theme as we see the past that gives us a in-depth back story of the beginning as we learn that ravenna has a sister Freya played brilliantly by the beautiful Emily Blunt who has power's as well , but due to certain event's become very cold hearted &amp; evil. As the story unfolds from the past it slowly moves to the future to a point 7 years after Ravenna played by Charlize Theron was defeated by snow white army which we saw in snow white &amp; huntsman.This is where the film continues on the sequel part of the film , where we get a narrative from iam nelson explaining parts of the film giving us a good in-depth story of the gap in the years as we learn true evil never dies. Playing the part of the ice queen Freya (Emily Blunt) played this role with perfection , this is why i love her as an actress because every role she is given she amerce her self in to the character &amp; become the character that is great acting to bring the character out on screen to give a believable performance. The way she play this role is that of a person that believe love is a lie &amp; empty with a cold heart so she goes out of her way to destroy anything that involves love , yet her appearance seemed calm &amp; relaxed in her scenes she wasn't someone to cross which you could see with the character. Charlize Theron returns as the evil mirror witch Ravenna brilliant performance as once again show us that she can play the seriously dark evil person that she was in the first film , only as we find out she no longer the human she once was &amp; now more powerful.Chris Hemsworth reprises his role as the huntsman who we saw in the first film as we get to a back story of where he original came from &amp; who brought him up which make an interest back story for his character as you get to see where he got his skills as a fighter. New casting for the film playing a some what love interest for the huntsman played by the beautiful Jessica Chastain playing Sara who put in a awesome performance as a skilled fighter &amp; well as a the romantic moments , I'm start to not only find her acting as an actress brilliant but she also a very beautiful woman its always great to see her in good role.Jessica plays off Chris Hemsworth brilliantly in this film with on screen chemistry which help the film's more believe to the the audience sells the film perfectly , as we come to the comical side of the film which is absolutely funny which come from the dwarf characters.Rob Brydon , Nick Frost , Alexandra Roach &amp; Sheridan Smith bring the comical side of the film as dwarf , i mean seriously funny banter which i was actually surprised with being funny , there are moments though out this film these guys were almost stealing the film because of the funniness which is great because they put 4 people together that actually play off each other in comedy which is very rare. This made the film more entertaining even the audience behind me in the cinema were laugh , there was a few moment with the banter your like you didn't just say that, there was a few ohhhh moments with what is said , this is what make for great film to watch.I will say this better improvement over the first film , not perfect but great film to watch.Dislikes : There is a few moments in the film that feel off in the editing part , like at the beginning like something was about to happen but the scene change in a different direction which was a little off, some scene kind of few flat, but that all i could see in the way of flaws in the film because the rest of the film was OK.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An enjoyable fantasy film with a positive message!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In a time where it is very common to see a lot of negativity and cynicism in reality and depicted on screen, it is a relief to watch an optimistic fantasy film with beautiful sets, visual effects, and morals. The film's cast is well put together as the actors are all very enjoyable to watch. None of the actors seemed to be miscast or stood out because of poor acting. The relationships between the characters are interesting, although some are slightly disappointing because they aren't as developed as they could be. The dwarfs are definitely the lighter characters who I also found to be pretty adorable, and they get the most laughs out of the audience. The heroes of the story are both interesting and break the usual tradition of having the male character be the hardened one, and the female character be soft. It's incredible to see Chris Hemsworth's character be strong and heroic but also have such a kind and compassionate side to him. The types of heroes that stories have to offer nowadays are typically stoic and quite cold, so seeing that warm side in a modern male protagonist is amazing, and I hope that future stories will also present male protagonists who can show similar emotion and vulnerability. Jessica Chastain's character is truly a badass, and one that didn't seem like a forced badass to me, which I find to be a usual complaint.Despite being villains, the two queen characters of the movie had touching, and surprising moments of humanity later on in the story. With that said, it is very fun to watch Emily Blunt and Charlize Theron play larger-than-life personalities and do cruel deeds throughout the film. You will find yourself rooting for them because they can be relatable, but also because they are wicked, you have to want them to fall. The only flaw I found with them is that they did not have enough screen time, but it doesn't take away from the film as the other characters keep you entertained as well.The story is simple, easy to follow, and is enough to keep you engaged. The concept of love is what is being explored in the film, and the story could even be a cautionary tale about the effects of having a lack of love. In the end, the message of love conquering the evils of the world isn't anything ground-breaking, but I think that it is a simple and universal idea that is still effective and powerful even today if you open yourself up to it. Being a big fan of the first film, I went into this with low expectations but an open mind. Thankfully, the film did not disappoint and I recommend seeing it on a large screen to appreciate the beauty of the effects and the costumes, but also be touched by the message that the film offers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A rare sequel that I thought was better than the original and I recommend this. Very exciting. Theron steals the movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Once upon a time a man and woman fell in love, but such things cannot last. For the heart is a treacherous thing, and love is nothing more than a fairy tale." Freya (Blunt) rules the kingdom along with her sister Ravenna (Theron). After the death of her child Freya changes and becomes the ice queen and outlaws love in the kingdom. She begins training an army but after Eric (Hemsworth) and Sara (Chastain) break her rule everything changes. Now years after Ravenna is killed Freya wants her mirror and will stop at nothing and use everyone to get what she wants. I wasn't all that excited about this movie. I wasn't a huge fan of the first one and with that in mind I had lower expectations. I'm not sure if that played a part in this or not but I really enjoyed this one quite a bit. There were parts that were a little slow, but overall the story kept me interested and the action was exciting and well placed. The chemistry between all the characters was great and without wanting to spoil anything...Theron really steals the movie in the limited time she has. If you liked the first one you will most likely like this one as well. Overall, a rare sequel that I thought was better than the original and I recommend this. Very exciting. I give this a B+.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>so this one picked up right where things left off and I liked that a lot was upset that the ice queen was playing jokes one these two people that feel in love over the years they where training but It was amazing. at the end the ice queen dies and so does her sister. the mirror was broken by the huntsman. the ice queen turned the mirror into ice and the huntsman throw his axed at it and it broke in to pieces and that was the best part to see that they both got what was coming for them. sadly a lot of the ice queens kids that she took from other people died. but she was still able to do stuff that she wanted by the time of her death</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An amazing couple of Authors (Evan Spiliotopoulos and Craig Mazin: the both of them have already written some very nice movies that you could have possibly enjoyed without knowing were theirs) took from where Evan Daugherty left and wrote a much inspired sequel to 'Snow White and the Huntsman'. And Cedric Nicolas - Troyan (a renowned special effects artist, here at his very first direction) did a perfect job in presenting it on the screen.The result is an entertaining and flawless fairy tale with great images, enjoyable plot, very good acting and great costumes. There is a great deal of art and workmanship in this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than the Trailer shows and better than the First one!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think the trailers don't do justice to the movie in regard to showing the real quality of it. The movie has amazing visual effects and wonderful original characters. People thought the movie is actually more about WOMEN, but I can assure you that the Huntsman (Chris Hemsworth) has a quite important and major role, but I think his scenes were overshadowed in the trailers. The three female leads are AMAZING. Apart from looking gorgeous, all three are incredibly talented and badass. I wished Raveena (Charlize Theron) had much more scenes, but she owns every scene she is in. One of my favourite actresses is Jessica Chastain and everyone who likes her will be much pleased, since she has many great and powerful scenes. She is a real badass. Her profession does not consist of constantly looking beautiful or feminine, as she presents here a very strong, masculine, yet emotional warrioress. I love how she always plays dominant and characterful figures who are also inspiring and compelling. You can easily follow how she changes her facial expressions, one second she is very tough, then suddenly she becomes very romantic and vulnerable. A terrific actress.Everyone who likes the first one, will surely like this one, too, since it has lots of fairy tale traits (apart from Snow White). There are very very dark scenes, which I loved, but there are also humorous and light scenes where the balance is really well made. I think you shouldn't hesitate and go enjoy this beautifully made movie with great performances. Everyone who loves fantasy and fairy tales should watch and recommend the movie to others.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I loved this film. I had to go to accompany my child and didn't think I would enjoy it but I was very pleasantly surprised. I actually hadn't seen the first film, so was able to go in without preconceived ideas, which probably helped. I was wary as the cinema was empty so I assumed it had had bad reviews, which was keeping people away. I actually really enjoyed the whole thing from start to finish. A good story, not too long or short, great visual impact and what is not to like about Chris Hemsworth - (never heard of him until now). Robust acting from Emily Blunt and Charlize Theron, held this film together nicely. I also loved the dwarf characters, who added some welcome humour to the film too. I would recommend this film if you want to spend a couple of enjoyable hours at the movies with your child.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Based on a false premise, and still a decent film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I want to say at the very beginning that at the base of this prequel/sequel is a false premise, or a logical fallacy. If one does remember the first movie, there's no way this one can be truly connected to the same story and characters. This is simply a story line that was stretched and contorted so another movie could be created with Charlize Theron as the evil queen and Chris Hemsworth as the huntsman, everything else didn't matter, the producers thought they could get some more money from the struggle between these two and the rest simply had to fit in. I knew that before I went to see this one, and I was practically ready to hate it. I didn't. And once again, the main reason is the acting. To be more precise, it's the three actresses pulling this unlikely story from start to end. Charlize Theron, once again menacing and chilling as the evil queen, with less fragility and less humanity. Which is, in my book the worst fault of this movie: if one does decide to further develop the characters of the first movie, the starting point should've been the origins of Ravena's hate for all men, and of human emotions. The creative team didn't go this way, this in fact made Ravena a two dimensional cartoon. Only Charlize Theron brilliance manages to make her somewhat relatable. Then there's Jessica Chastain as Sara with a performance filled with subtleties and nuances, managing to look like a fierce warrior and still make us feel she has a beating heart in her chest. But both Jessica Chastain and Charlize Theron pale in front of the real standout performance of this film, that's the one of Emily Blunt. The truth is, she does have the best written role in the film, and she carries it and in fact the entire movie all the way through. If only they could do the same for Charlize Theron, this could've been a real something to see. But even as is, the movie is surprisingly engaging and entertaining.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw "The Huntsman:Winter's War", starring Chris Hemsworth-Thor in the Marvel movies, Rush; Charlize Theron-Mad Max:Fury Road, Children of the Corn 3:Urban Harvest; Jessica Chastain-The Martian, Mama and Emily Blunt-Edge of Tomorrow, Looper.This is a sequel and a prequel to the 2012 'Snow White and the Huntsman'. Snow White is not in this one. Charlize is just barely-at the beginning and at the end. It starts off with Charlize killing her husband and taking charge of her kingdom as the new Queen. Emily is her sister that has not developed her sorceress powers yet, but soon does, after Charlize pulls a dirty trick on her. Emily becomes like the girl from 'Frozen'; she has ice powers. The sisters go their separate ways and each has profound changes made in their lives. Emily looses all her feelings for anything to do with love-and doesn't believe that anyone else should have loving feelings, either- and Charlize goes off and gets killed by Snow White. Emily decides to build herself an army to take over every kingdom in the country and Chris and Jessica become her top 2 students. Problems arise when Chris and Jessica fall in love-a big no no, according to Emily-and the love birds are separated. About 7 years pass and that's when the movie kicks into sequel mode. Charlize reappears-don't worry, it is explained how that is possible-and starts causing problems for her sister and Chris &amp; Jessica. The fight scenes are pretty good, effects are adequate and there is even some humor thrown in. As far as being a big blockbuster? Not quite. Just Adequate. It's rated "PG-13" for fantasy action, violence and sexual content-no nudity-and has a running time of 1 hour &amp; 54 minutes. It's not one I would buy on DVD but it would make a good rental.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>light-hearted fun that actually works a lot better than its predecessor!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw The Huntsman: Winter's War today and I felt inclined to write down some thoughts on the film. We live in the age of the internet, and consequently, we are subjected to absolutely everyone's opinion (I am aware of the irony here). This over-exposure can actually be quite exhausting at times, as the negatives are always the first to be seen. The Huntsman has 22% on Rotten Tomatoes at the time of writing this, and I couldn't feel more indifferent to it. This is one of those instances where I feel a 'fuck the critics' sort of attitude. While I am fully aware that this is no Return of the King, I know it's not trying be - These films are innocent fun at best. These are my thoughts:The plot is marketed almost completely different to how it turns out, much to my frustration. As is the norm nowadays, the trailer contains way too much of the film. The most infuriating of all ? the actual twist of the film, however predictable, is reduced to a throwaway aspect of the marketing! Not to mention the entire third act features heavily in promotional material ? including some pivotal shots. To clarify how it differs to the actual film ? the trailer markets it as somewhat of a sibling rivalry, whereas in reality Ravenna (Charlize Theron) mostly doesn't appear until the third act. The film focuses on the Magic Mirror and delivering it to Sanctuary. While the plot doesn't do too many unique things, and is crammed with genre conventions, they are sometimes delivered above expectations. For example, too much screen time isn't wasted repairing the relationship between The Huntsman (Chris Hemsworth) and his wife (Jessica Chastain) beyond what is needed. A huge plot hole I thought the film would have briefly explained was the fact that Freya (Emily Blunt) was never spoken about or shown before now. Even during the flashback scenes in the first film, with young Ravenna and her brother, it is never explained why Freya was never seen ? or even where their brother is during the events surrounding the death of Freya's baby. It would have been great to see, but I can't say it's a shocking omission. Something that greatly added to my enjoyment is the whole tone of the film, which is definitely a lot less sombre this time around.Moving onto performances, Hemsworth and Theron deliver the expected solid acting we've come to expect (Hemsworth's accent has surely improved since the last film), and newcomer Blunt is cast perfectly in her role. Chastain, while a terrific actress and a convincing character, had me yo-yoing on my opinion of her accent. For those unaware, Chastain's character Sara plays the kickass wife of Hemsworth's Eric, and the plot calls for her to have a Scottish accent, naturally; I guess it kinda makes sense considering the characters are from the same place, but I don't want to get too hung up on accents when they range from all over the UK. Anyway, Sara sounds Irish in some lines and Australian in others, but it's not film-ruining ? I see it as a similar situation to Hemsworth's accent in the first film; maybe she'll perfect it if another sequel gets greenlit.Filling in the supporting roles and cameos, Nick Frost returns with Dwarf company in the form of Rob Brydon, Sheridan Smith and Alexandra Roach ? and kudos to them! Whereas I couldn't stand the dwarfs in Snow White and the Huntsman, here they are one of the film's highlights. They provide the majority of the comic relief, and I laughed way more than I should probably admit; Brydon in particular, although I may just be biased because I'm Welsh. That being said, no character really feels out of place. I certainly wasn't expecting to see Colin Morgan as Freya's lover, Sam Claflin return as Snow White's husband, William and? is that Liam Neeson as the narrator?!Speaking of appearances (or disappearances in this case), Kristen Stewart's Snow White is nowhere to be seen, save for a shot of archive footage from movie #1 and a brief scene with a stand-in. This is to be expected since the scandal that surrounded her affair, but it still would have been cool to see a cameo. Ballsy even. Fingers crossed she returns for a sequel ? Ravenna did vow vengeance after all, and if the last shot is anything to go by? she'll be back. I actually liked Snow White and Stewart is by no means the catastrophe of an actor that people make out; just look at her more recent performances like that in Still Alice ? but that argument is for another time.These films have always been the sort to favour style over substance, and that is evident here ? but this time the ratio allows for that bit more substance. The sets are pretty good and the visual effects definitely hold up. The costumes and make-up are extremely beautiful to look at in regards to the elegant queens. James Newton Howard returns to score the film, and with him a few minor themes to solidify the film in its universe. While not a ground-breaking film in any sense, I had a lot of fun watching it. It feels like an appropriate sequel and actually works a lot better than its predecessor. Most importantly ? its light-hearted fun and I'm likely to be one of the few to hope that a sequel is on the cards.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Huntsman: Winter's war is much worse movie, than Snow White and Huntsman was. Even it is beautifully set the story is quite empty. With it's dryish slap stick humor in it is mostly repellent and lame. It's supposed to be prequel movie to Snow White and Huntsman story, but you can hardly find any reference mark to first movie. Charlize Theron as evil queen is great, but she has regrettable too less of the screen time in this movie. Shaking shooting in some action scenes makes it hard to follow, which is unlucky to story telling. And those 3D glasses wont even make it easier to follow. Even the movie is quite visually beautiful, some of the monsters looks stupidly animated. Maybe most of the movie budget has spent to hire famous actors. In many times set feels like theater like set and doesn't feel very realistic. You may say, that it is a fairy tale and it shouldn't be realistic. But with this budget it should. Movie has flopped quite badly at movie theatres (even I Was with my husband alone in this screening) and it is not a worth of a movie ticket. I believe you will find this movie from Netflix quite soon, so maybe it is better to wit to see from there. At least you can pause it as many times you want to visit refrigerator. Even 3D won't give to you extra reason to see it in movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a perfectly adequate movie that is well-made and forgettable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Huntsman: Winter's War is not too unlike the first movie in one key way: it doesn't really stick too long in the consciousness once it's finished. It's not that there is a lack of quality in the craft in this (sigh) franchise - the first Snow White from 2012 got Oscar nominations for the costume design and visual effects departments, and it's easy to see why: the work put into the mirror on its own, this gold thing that can unfold in liquid on the floor is in the same ball-park as the T-1000 from decades past, and there is attention paid to all of the aesthetics in these 'kingdoms'. But with the stories, especially in the case of Winter's War, there is the sense of sensing a dearth of original plots. It's not even really a full plot in this film but plot points: this happens and then this happens and then and then and so on, and it cribs from Frozen so much that it's hard to ignore.It's not that everything from the Disney movie is here, but when you start to describe what this story is about - two sisters in royalty are split apart when one of them (Emily Blunt this time as the sister to Charlize Theron's Wicked Queen) loses her son and takes over her kingdom... which is made of ice since she is the Ice Queen, and she decrees there can no longer be love because her love is lost, so then when two people (Hemsworth, returning as the Huntsman, and Jessica Chastain) fall in love, she splits them apart through trickery and then... it's actually not a prequel but a sequel which involves finding the mirror from the last movie (stolen/taken away, I forget which, it's explained in an exposition dump), and when a big reveal happens for Hemsworth that (spoiler! not really) Chastain is alive, they decide to go after the Ice Queen herself.So there's a lot of plot here, a lot of twists and turns that do occur, but that main spine isn't too engaging. The Frozen element comes mostly with the Ice Queen and other characters having a love story happen where you don't expect it to (or, I should say, they *do* love each other, but things happen that makes one of them question again if it's possible and, oh, nevermind). What does still work is the humor; Nick Frost returns as one of the dwarfs from the last movie (the late Bob Hoskins is sorely missed though) along with Rob Brydon (remember him from The Trip movies), and both are spot-on with their comic timing, their deliveries, just finding the things in the scenes to naturally liven things up. Some of it's from the dialog, but a good deal of it feels improvised and when lady dwarfs get introduced into the film there's some fun stuff there as well.All the actors are here to work, and I didn't see them exactly bored during this; Blunt does her best to give her Ice Queen Freya conviction and villainy (and, later on, some sense of true confusion and betrayal), but it's hard to go up against Theron when she owns this role once again of Ravenna. She's not on screen too long, and it feels just slightly contrived how she returns, but she makes her mark as a conniving, devilish presence with aplomb. Curiously Kirsten Stewart is out of this movie, though there are points where it feels like she *should* be in this, even as a cameo (there is one scene where technically Snow White is featured, but it's a double of course). This absence gets felt in a narrative that is all about the other characters, which is fine, except that the script lets them down with an adventure-cum-quest-cum-revenge story that feels watered down or half-baked. And there are even some moments, like with a creature that the characters come across to find the mirror, that isn't a terribly convincing special effect.I almost feel like I need to write this so I don't forget most of the movie in a few days; it's not *bad* in the sense of it being too stupid or too illogical (though there are certainly points where you think 'yeah, that's a bad idea to, say, make that jump and hope to connect with that building even when you know and acknowledge that it's a bad idea'). If it's bad in any way it doesn't have really any artistic reason to exist aside from it being another check box for Universal studio's current Snow White universe property. To put it another way, when you have Liam Neeson narrating and delivering lines about fairy tales that felt hackneyed 60 years ago, you know there's an issue with something that should be made vs could. It's got entertaining bits but isn't worth rushing out to see unless you're a die-hard fantasy fan, and even with that there's the sense of derivation (if not from Frozen there's Game of Thrones as well).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun &amp; fantasy!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Reading critics reviews I've had very low expectations but I really don't know what they expect of a fantasy movie like this one? It certainly isn't Lord of the Rings but I've had fun. It is definitely an improvement over the first one which I found boring(except Charlize performance). SWATH biggest mistake is that it's taking itself too serious. Winter's War is just what it needs to be - a fun fantasy movie. Cast did a good job. For me the highlights are Charlize Theron(again) and Emily Blunt. Although there is a less of Theron than in the first movie, her screen time is very effective, she's really stealing the show and you see that Charlize had a great fun playing Ravenna. As I said I like that it has more fun than the first one, it's campy but in a good way, I mean we got two diva queens, they need to ham it up! The story is predictable but hey, 90% of this kind of movies are! Photography, costumes and special effects are perfect, it is really beautiful visually. So, there you go, it's an eye candy with two great leading ladies.</fullReview>

Their acting was very good, as always. They are two evil sisters that want to conquer all, using black magic and a magical mirror.You really enjoy the visual effects on this movie and the customs of the two evil queens are awesome.In my opinion, Jessica Chastain in an improvement of a protagonist from Kristen Stewart. First, Chastain can act and second she has better fighting skills.I think that the story is good, but predictable ( you still enjoy it, though) This is not an action/ superhero's film... If you are expecting a lot of fighting, this is not your movie. This film is not a suspense one either; but if you like fairy tales movies with special effects, good acting , then you will enjoy this movie.</fullReview>

If you want to watch an action packed fantasy drama with some decent CGI effects and decent acting , well you cant discount this film . I personally found this better than the first one as the first one was tad slower and seemed to drag on a bit perhaps more so because of snow white and her frozen acting . Here the frost queen acted more fluidly . I did enjoy the CGI as well because it was not over used and the colouring of the gold with black in contrast with the ice queens blue and white went really well. In my opinion its definitely worth a watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another movie not as bad as its rating would suggest.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Here we go again folks. Another movie that has been critically panned and which (quelle surprise!) is not as awful as you might think. Sure, it's no masterpiece, but it doesn't deserve some of the comments on here.Two of these gripes are: "There's not enough Snow White!" To which I say, "Thank God!" Kristen Bell was God-awful in the original movie and, leaving aside the questionable rumours surrounding her and the director of that film, she sleepwalked through most of her scenes. Also, apparently in a movie entitled "Huntsman: Winter's War" did they not perhaps get a slight inkling that he might be the main character. Snow White was dull as ditchwater, so it is no surprise they ditched her character in favour of a more interesting one.The second complaint: "They ripped off Frozen!" To which I say "Duh!" Apparently only Disney are allowed to use established fairy-tale stories and everyone else is just a plagiarist. Who knew? In this case, knew that people aren't aware of "The Snow Queen". If there is any ripping off being done, trust me, Disney are always first in line.So, these nonsense complaints aside, is the movie any good? Or at least any fun? Well, yes it is. I'll admit, it starts off somewhat seriously and rather shakily, with the first thirty minutes or so making you wonder if the effort of watching it is going to be worth it. But then, wonder of wonders, the writers remembered the one thing about the original which saved its otherwise turgid behind... The Dwarfs.Yes folks, the comedy dwarfs make a return. Well, Nick Frost's Nion, anyway. He is joined by three others and they, like in the original get all the funniest lines and elevate the movie from what would otherwise be a rather dour and somewhat campily depressing affair.Honestly, if they make a third movie, they might as well dispense with all the human characters and just make it about the dwarfs. At least then it will be entertaining throughout, and not just biding its time until they appear.Story-wise, it has some issues, but holds together reasonably well. It's not hard to follow but thrown up some awkward questions in relation to the first movie that are not addressed. Likewise,towards the end, two of the dwarfs are forgotten about during the daring rescue, only showing up after the dust has settled. Bad editing? Or just scenes cut for time? Or maybe just poor writing. Who knows.Acting-wise, Charlize Theron continues to overact her role as Ravenna, mugging and leering at the camera for all she is worth. Everyone else just seems to have fun with their roles, but the real standout for me was Jessica Chastain. I'm not a big fan of her work, but this was an eye-opener for me.Effects are decent, for the most part and serve the story well enough, though the "liquid mirror" effect just doesn't look convincing.Overall, the movie is entertaining (especially once the dwarfs show up) and it is worth a watch.EDIT: As a side-note, IMDb refuses to allow the spelling of the plural of dwarf as d-w-a-r-v-e-s (I had to do that as it auto-magically changes it to dwarfs otherwise). Both are perfectly acceptable spellings, but unlike other words, which it allows you to choose a spelling, apparently they know best in this case. Jeez! And you people wonder why I nitpick so much!SUMMARY: Reasonably entertaining. Fixes some of the problems with the first film. As a bonus...no Kristen Stewart! Extra Bonus... more dwarfs (Grrr! D-w-a-r-v-e-s!)</fullReview>

By the way I Love jessica Chastain.Such a great and beautiful actress. I would have loved to have seen Theron and Blunt's characters interact more. They had good chemistry. They should star in another film together.It would be interesting. The movie is called The Huntsman and so I must talk about Chris Hemsworth. He has never been the best actor but I've always liked his screen presence and here it's no different. The Huntsman is like a glazed donut that you know is bad for you but you just can't help enjoy.

		<shortDescription>Snow White's Sequel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I never realised that Snow White actually had a sequel, and that probably has a lot to do with the fact that it doesn't. However, true to Hollywood form, they go out of their way to create a sequel where none actually existed. Okay, Snow White and the Huntsman was a retelling of the classic Snow White tale, however what Huntsman does is that we leave Snow White as the queen of her realm and then tells the backstory, sort of, of the Huntsman.The problem with sequels these days is that I can't actually remember much of the original movie, and even if video stores still existed (or I wasn't so stingy as not to sign up for Netflix) I probably wouldn't sit down and watch the original movie again because, well, I have better things to do with my time. That doesn't necessarily mean that you need to watch the original movie to enjoy this film ? you don't ? it just means that there are a couple of references that you may not understand, but you can still watch, and enjoy, the film nonetheless.As I mentioned, this film tells the backstory of the Huntsman, to an extent. After telling us how the wicked queen had a sister who watched her baby get burnt to death, and then turned into the ice queen and carved out a kingdom for herself in the north, we are then introduced to the Huntsman. Basically he was abducted by the ice queen Freya who was raising an army to pretty much conquer the north, and in turn the rest of the world. However the Huntsman falls in love with another of the soldiers, and the ice queen kills him and leaves him for dead. Yet he survives, and then the events of Snow White happen. The film then picks up the story after the 'happily ever after'.I will admit that I did quite enjoy this film, though it wasn't hugely fantastic. In a way it did seem to lack an engaging script, and the imagination and story telling was quite lacking. In a way it simply suffered from what one would call sequalitis. Sure, the original film was enjoyable, and did bring out the fantasy elements a lot more (as did this film), however it was simply a basic plot (with a bit of a twist at the end) that simply exists as mindless entertainment as opposed to something really engaging. Of course the idea of 'love conquers all' is a major theme running through this film, but in the end I find this whole Hollywood concept of love to be getting a little dry.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mirror, mirror, on the wall, which next sequel is yet to fool?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>2016 so far marks as the year of sequels and reboots ? some are well-crafted but most are either disappointing or simply unnecessary. The Huntsman: Winter's War, which serves as both the prequel and the sequel (a "sprequel", if you may call it) to Snow White and the Huntsman, may not be highly-anticipated but it proves to be more entertaining than its gloomy predecessor, with a visual flair surrealistic enough to distract you from its flawed narrative.The Huntsman: Winter's War feels the need to validate its existence by borrowing elements from other superior fantasy films. But still in the process, it fails to deliver a solid plot with a strong emotional core the way Maleficient or Frozen does (it is impossible to unthink of Frozen for Elsa's evil version is here). Cedric Nicolas-Troyan, who was the special effects supervisor in the first film, makes his directorial debut and it is crystal clear here that his top priority remains to be the visual spectacle, leading to a classic case of style over substance. The visuals are lavishly done and that is a welcome treat for as long as the quality of direction is not traded-off. Equipped with extravagant and intricate costume and design set pieces, some scenes can be practically edited and turned into one big production of a perfume or cosmetic ad.Another thing that the film can boast is the star power cast that it manages to assemble. The four main leads here play characters that are not exactly engrossingly-written, however they still manage to dig deep into them and give viewers something to sink their teeth in. Chris Hemsworth is a far better protagonist than a disinterested Kristen Stewart in the first film. His reputation for playing Thor in Marvel's cinematic universe gives him a bullet-proof assurance that he can deliver even the corniest lines with the help of his rugged charm. Notwithstanding a clumsily-penned love story arc, he strikes a decent chemistry with Jessica Chastain. Chastain surprisingly takes part in here (considering that fantasy genre is not in her wheelhouse) and she convincingly portrays a driven and earnest action heroine. Both Hemsworth and Chastain are however burdened with a Scottish accent throughout the film. Emily Blunt as a conflicted antagonist having unjustified actions brings a roller- coaster of emotions from vulnerability to wrath in her craft. Her on-screen sister, Charlize Theron, who is obviously not dead from the trailer may have a lesser screen time but she is still poised to steal the show with her menacing death-stares and spiky tentacles. She even remains to be lethal in a liquid gold form. The digitally- shrunk quartet of dwarfs, Nion (Nick Frost), Gryff (Rob Brydon), Doreena (Alexandra Roach) and Bromwyn (Sheridan Smith) are a welcome addition despite being obviously there for comic-relief for they add little to nothing to the plot.Still, not even the winning combination of visual effects, costume design and great casting can salvage an under-directed sappy fantasy story of love that conquers all. This is yet again a generic cash- grab product of Hollywood. Time to chant the words: Mirror, mirror, on the wall, which next sequel is yet to fool?Full review: http://www.filmpolicereviews.com/reviews/huntsman-winters-war</fullReview>

Also, I am not exactly disappointed that Kristen Stewart did not make a return. Anyways, if u want to enjoy a good story in a fantasy setting, go see this film.

		<fullReview>After the cheating Kristen Stewart/Rupert Sanders scandal surrounding the 2012 film Snow White And The Huntsman, it was interesting to see that Universal Pictures decided to create a sequel. Chris Hemsworth, who is mostly known for playing Thor in Marvel's Avengers franchise, returns as the Huntsman Eric in The Huntsman: Winter's War ? this time in a leading role. Charlize Theron is also at her seductive best, reprising her role as the evil Ravenna and she continues to be absolutely stunning in this franchise.New additions to the story include Eric's love interest Sara, played by Jessica Chastain and Ravenna's icy sister Freya enters the story as well, played by the diverse and always beautiful Emily Blunt. In the entire film, there is only one very brief mention of the Snow White character and I'm sure casting agents would have made quite a huge amount of savings to the budget by having a humble extra play her in one tiny scene where you see no details of her face whatsoever. Good for them!This film was everything you want from a fantasy film. Perfectly timed action sequences that didn't drag on for too long, evil sibling rivalry, a gorgeous leading man and several gorgeous leading ladies. It even included some comic relief, with the naturally hilarious Rob Brydon and Nick Frost playing two dwarfs who help Eric along on his journey to retrieve the stolen magic mirror (at the request of Snow White's Prince Charming himself, William, played by Sam Claflin).This film delivered as being a darker, more adult version of Disney's Frozen and apart from it being a little cheesy at times and slightly predictable, it was an enjoyable popcorn movie where, aside from (or possibly because of) a few obvious plot twists, delivers exactly what you'd expect.motherofpopcorn.wordpress.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I may be alone on this but I actually quite enjoy HUNTSMAN: THE WINTER'S WAR. Yes if only they could include Kristen Stewart again but how the writers managed to find a way to continue the story and tell it in the form of both a prequel and a sequel, that itself is interesting. I find HUNTSMAN: THE WINTER'S WAR mesmerizing, in terms of the costumes, production design and visual effects, and there's just so much power in Charlize Theron's performance, I can't keep my eyes off of her.HUNTSMAN: THE WINTER'S WAR is the story that came before 'Snow White And The Huntsman' and what happens after, so it kind of detours around the first installment. Emily Blunt plays the good sister Freya, while Charlize Theron's Ravenna tries to convince her that man will eventually break your heat and betray you. When Freya experiences exactly that, she becomes a cold-hearted ice queen who kidnaps children and raises them as her army to conquer one kingdom after the other. Eric (Chris Hemsworth) and Sara (Jessica Chastain) are among those who grew up warriors for Freya, but what Freya doesn't know is that Eric and Sara secretly engage in what is forbidden throughout the kingdom, love. Years later, a war escalates between two queens and so Eric and Sara must help Freya vanquish Ravenna's wickedness. The previous installment was nominated for two Oscars, one of which is for best VFX, and one of the nominated VFX team members ends up being the director of HUNTSMAN: THE WINTER'S WAR, Cedric Nicolas-Troyan. That's one of the many appeals of this film, visual-wise, it just looks stunning for a fantasy action adventure. And the great Colleen Atwood returned as well, both Charlize Theron and Emily Blunt look so ravishing in those head-turning, captivating dresses, Atwood was going for lavish and extravagant but also they also exude authority.I think THE HUNTSMAN: WINTER'S WAR is a more interesting story because this time around, it's no longer about, 'look, we can make normal-sized people appear dwarf-like' so the attention isn't on that anymore, and I appreciate that the whole themes of betrayal and love stay true from start to finish, they don't evolve into something they're not or some unnecessary colossal war. I like how Emily Blunt's character is not a complete villain, if anything, her character is more of a martyr, it's the same approach taken by "Maleficent," both movies were produced by Joe Roth. And I also like the fact that Charlize Theron gets to do more in this film as opposed to just screaming and yelling. So story-wise, it's an improvement, it's not perfect, but ultimately, THE HUNTSMAN: WINTER'S WAR is for the hopelessly romantic -- Rama's Screen --</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An improvement on the original with an outstanding cast</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Huntsman: Winter's War may have its flaws, but is an undeniable improvement over the first which appears even more average due to the new life found in the second. Some dodgy and questionable accents aside, the main four and the supporting four all compliment each other and offer strong and more complex performances (especially those returning), if only the underrated Sam Clafflin got more of a look in. Beautiful scenery, landscapes and effects all help in building this fantasy world and the before-and-after structure helps with the flow of the story once you overcome the inceptive confusion. I went into this film expecting to come out disappointed but instead did so feeling pleasantly surprised at the increased quality and final product. Summary: The Huntsman: Winter's War, whilst with its flaws, is an undeniable improvement over the first instalment, with rich scenery and landscapes bolstered further by solid performances all round.FULL REVIEW: http://goo.gl/jrMAbH</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My wife and I went to the cinemas to watch this movie. We have seen the first part and we liked it very much. So we thought that this part could not be any better ..but what a big surprise, this part is even better! We loved the storyline and what a great performance of the actors! The graphics are really stunning and we fell in love with the settings and the magical forest. The storyline was excited until the end. Some parts of this movie brings us back to Lord of the Rings. Our favorite movie ever! But we liked this part better than the previous part. And that usually does not happen with any movie. So thumbs up for the director and actors!We would go every day to the cinema to watch these kind of movies! Thank you soo much for this nice evening!

		<fullReview>My excitement for this film could not have been greater. It has some of my favourite actors in namely Emily Blunt and Jessica Chastain. I am pleased to say that this film did not disappoint. The film is prequel and sequel combined which is extremely clever and works really well. The writers have done a great job of making this story fit with the events that took place in Snow White and The Huntsman. This film is much better than it's predecessor. The plot is much more interesting and it doesn't drag in the middle like the Snow White ones does. (As a side note, there are references to the Snow White film so I'd recommend watching it before going to see this one). This film has some really funny moments as well as plenty of action sequences. All the actors give good performances. An extremely enjoyable film which I look forward to watching again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More than just visual effects!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I previewed this movie tonight having no recollection of ever seeing the first one (although I realize now I have and simply forgot about it due to its mediocrity). This movie was awesome! As in the first film, the visual effects are stunning and even though I am easily displeased with shoddy CGI, only in one brief scene did I think it was done somewhat poorly. (For reference, I did not see it in IMAX or 3D). While some of the plot points were transparent, the narrative as a whole was quite engaging and was acted well enough for me to really feel for the characters. Another reviewer mentioned the humor of the film in a somewhat negative way but I (and by the sound of it, the rest of the theater) thought it was done perfectly-- it wasn't forced onto characters or into situations it didn't belong in but instead lent itself to filling out the characters and even making some subtle points about relationships, friendships, and life as a whole.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Totally surprised about this film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have strong feelings about movies and how people approach them, in how it affects my own enjoyment and rating of a movie.I went into this film expecting nothing really and that it would be a standard fantasy fare worth the usual six for a medium sized movie.I had read various fan reviews and for the most part I prefer them to what the critics say because they tend to me far more honest and except for the trolls, whom it easy to spot and ignore these wasters and found that they were sending my expectations even further down the ratings scale.Fortunately, I thoroughly enjoyed this film and had not seen the previous installment. I was entertained on nearly every level, and while there were some goofs and a couple of dead spots, I did have a good time and the 40 other Aussies in our local cinema at Penrith, all laughed a lot and there was a very positive vibe during and after the movie. And my wife and I really enjoyed it without thinking we had been to see a true movie classic or anything that would live on forever in our minds.However, when I went to recent movies like The Avengers and Star Wars with all their great hype I did enjoy them, but for the most part was totally underwhelmed by the dialogue and the overall entertainment value of these films. They did their job, but I have seen so many other films, which were done better, made better and that I know I will love for years to come. Deadpool and Mad Max, were both far superior in most departments to these films, and much of Star Wars box office is due to the fact that it is shown to kids while the other two are not. I imagine this alone accounts for a big difference in their box office takings.I know that in ten years from now, series like LOTR, The Hobbit, Mad Max and inter-related movies like Deadpool/Suicide Squad will still ring clear in my imagination while the most recent 4 Star Wars movies will have faded into oblivion.I will say this though, Star Wars and The Avengers are still several classes above the execrable Divergent series which gets worse with every installment and lacks a truly cool and elegant or funny lead in Shailene Woodley (a reasonable actor, but so totally miscast and out of her depth in this series) a poor support cast, and very dull story lines and dialogue.The Hunger Games is superior to the Divergent series, in all departments especially the actors and special effects, but the story etc are still tedious and the series (while entertaining) is highly over-rated particularly as the makers went into "bloated" and "OTT" mode for the closing chapters and destroyed what could have been a terrific series. If only the series had the writers from Deadpool or the kinetic energy of Mad Max (which has its downside, but like Deadpool) has something that these other movies totally lack and that is movie magic.It is always such a shame to me that movie makers cannot step back enough from their films and look at what they are doing with a clearer vision, cannot be critical enough of their own scripts, or the greatest disease of all, falling foul of the studios/producers who do not understand what it is to make a great film, or cannot control their own agendas enough to allow the directors and their crews and cast to weave the magic that hey themselves so often lack.If nothing else, The Huntsman had humour, drama, cool effects and stunts, a basic but pleasing story and enough going for it generally to allow some movie magic to shine through to the audience.If you go to the movies once a week like we do, to be entertained by anything from a thriller, a romance, all action, supernatural, war or western or whatever, I want to leave feeling I have been entertained and that this movie has brought something cool to my life. Once in a while there will be the unforgettable story, but it seems to me so many people these days expect every movie to be a total blockbuster so spend much of their movie life being disappointed simply by demanding too much of others than to be simply entertained for 90-180 minutes. And then joyful, when they come across a true gem, like The Revenants, The Intouchables, or whatever other movie leaves an indelible mark on your heart and in your head...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hot and Cold Wage War.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Huntsman: Winter's War (2016): Dir: Cedric Nicolas-Troyan / Cast: Chris Hemsworth, Charlize Theron, Emily Blunt, Jessica Chastain, Nick Frost: Equal followup to Snow White and the Huntsman. This one regards the wars that wage within one's heart when they have been wronged. Chris Hemsworth plays Eric the huntsman who is sent on a quest to find a magic mirror that is under threat of falling into the wrong hands. Charlize Theron returns as the evil queen Ravenna who tricks her sister and is at the source of the film's conflict. Emily Blunt plays her sister Freya whose affair with the Duke of Blackwood results in betrayal and the murder of her child. Her inner rage unleashes a power of snow and ice. She isolates herself away and forms an army that begins with children. Jessica Chastain plays Sara, Eric's love interest. They grew up in Freya's army but formed forbidden love. They planned to elope until Freya learns of their plans. Other characters are either underdeveloped or incredibly over the top such as the case with four dwarfs. While the screenplay is exceptional the special effects carry the film either with flaming delivery by Ravenna or walls of ice thrown by Freya. These two opposing factors make up for a majority of scene stealing visuals. Director Cedric Nicolas-Troyan was involved with the first film as well as another evil queen film called Maleficent. Here is proves promising while going in a different direction to traditional storytelling. The result is a worthwhile battle of hot and cold with only the lukewarm left to engage the separation.

		<shortDescription>Get to know the raising of a new queen, the story before and after Snow White get her kingdom back. And of course the creation of the Huntsman and the story with his wife!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let's begin with the fact that this movie has an amazing cast &amp; crew. If you have seen the first one you probably know what I'm saying. And adding Emily Blunt and Jessica Chastain was a brilliant idea. Now, the movie was amazing in all of the ways, to the character, dialogues, music, effects. Everything. It was a really good experience and if there's a new movie for this saga, go for it. I'll be there expecting it. SPOILERS BELOW! The plot was something else, blowing your mind and all that you thought you knew from "Snow White and the Huntsman" and let's be honest I was happy as hell to see that the Huntsman wife was freaking alive! He was a character that during the entire movie I felt that he needed to be happy. And yes, mission complete.We already knew something about the past of Ravenna but adding the story of her sister was really cool, and that that sister is an ice queen was better. Of course, we all knew that she had something to do with the awaking of her powers, but again it was pretty sad. But somehow if Ravenna is involved you know that nothing good can come from it. I also felt like she didn't want to end like her sister, like Freya was the sister with a heart and somewhere deep down she still felt pain. Anyway, everything about the movie was good, like I said before. So yeah, it deserves a 10/10 if you haven't seen it yet, go and watch it. You won't regret (if you like this kind of movies of course, because if you like reality movies run away and never look back). Great movie!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Huntsman: Winter's War (2016)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I typically don't see a movie solely for its cast, but I couldn't pass up a movie with Jessica Chastain, Charlize Theron, Emily Blunt and Chris Hemsworth. Winter's War certainly isn't the best thing these actors have done in their careers, but it's still a fairly entertaining twist on the Snow White tale. The Huntsman acts as a prequel and sequel to 2012's Snow White and the Huntsman, which I regrettably hadn't seen before I watched this, and it follows an escalating battle between the Ice Queen, Freya, and her sister, Ravenna. Freya's former Huntsman, Eric and, fellow warrior, Sara, who were raised to protect Freya, have to conceal their forbidden love while combat Ravenna's intentions to take back Snow White's kingdom. Despite the campy writing and plot inconsistencies, I still found quite a bit to enjoy about Winter's War. Watching Charlize Theron be a badass as the Evil Queen was ridiculously entertaining. There's also the beautiful cinematography, costumes, visual effects and *ahem* Chris Hemsworth that made the movie visually stunning. The campy writing also isn't so bad that it goes into cheese territory. It's fairly self aware and fun while not taking itself overly seriously. The plot is a bit more of a fantasy romance with some action in it, but Jessica Chastain and Chris Hemsworth give their characters some life so that you do want to see them succeed by the time the movie is over. The Huntsman: Winter's War is fairly slight entertainment, but it's got a great cast, characters, stunning visuals and a lot of fun.</fullReview>

A good villain I find is one that you can empathise with a little bit. Her acting is always superb. Special effects were stunning with some really memorable scenes and great costumes. A few obvious rip offs from other movies here and there but it didn't really matter. Best of all that Kirsten Stewart is nowhere to be scene. A good choice by the studio if you ask me!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was very hyped for this movie release. The trailers were stunning and got me hooked. In all its simplicity (dialogue wise), it looked as if it would be a fun thing to watch in the cinemas.That wasn't far from the truth, really.This is their take on the Huntsman's story. The trailers make it look as if this is an attempt to make people completely forget and disregard the first movie (Snow White and the Huntsman). This is ultimately not the case. The Huntsman: Winter's War, takes place after Snow White defeats the evil queen Ravenna, and the Huntsman is still in mourning over his supposedly dead wife, Sara. The movie gives more backstory on how Sara and Eric were part of the children taken in by Freya, Ravenna's sister who is dubbed as "The Ice Queen" and how their love was tested for seven years, with Eric being tricked that Sara was dead. A plot to resurrect Ravenna is in the works.I'll admit, the first half of the movie was very... bland. Don't get me wrong - the actors and actresses were excellent in carrying out their roles. Rather, it was the dialogue that gave me doubts on how this movie would turn out. The dialogue did not evoke as much emotion as I expected, and comes off flat. What makes up for it is the second half of the movie, when Ravenna does come to life once more (but not quite). What starts off as a love story we cannot immerse ourselves in is given a chance to shine and redeem itself. It succeeds, and manages to blend well with the tale of the two sisters. It becomes an entertainment fest. The costumes, the acting, the CG effects - they are all maximized and put to use in the latter half of the movie. The right word would be stunning. You'll start forgetting those earlier moments wherein love was a word thrown around carelessly to somehow thicken the plot.Everyone says that the cast is the best part of the movie. That is undeniable. Jessica Chastain's stunts as Sara are amazing, while Charlize Theron (Ravenna) and Emily Blunt (Freya) manage to capture the essence of their characters and even give us a heart to care for them. Chris Hemsworth (Eric) adds a playful touch to The Huntsman that has never been seen before. If you actually give this movie a chance, what shines through is a simple but meaningful message: Love doesn't always prevail, but there are some things worth fighting for till the very end.It's a guilty pleasure through and through, and definitely worth a movie ticket in my book.</fullReview>

If your into love movies the story between The huntsman and Sara is amazing and something most strive to get. If you want action and gore there is definitely plenty of that also. Add to it magic and special effects and this movie will keep 9 out of 10 very entertained.Nick Frost playing a dwarf will capture that last person and make this movie one that everyone will find something they like in it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>'There's no hope for love. Love ends in betrayal.'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director Cedric Nicholas-Troyan (Snow White and the Huntsman, The Ring) continues his fascination with fairy tales ? Snow White in particular ? by pushing the envelope on the Huntsman into this second foray of the ancient fairy tale. Due to extraordinary CGI visual effects and the wonderful comic attitude of Chris Hemsworth and a cast that seems to be having a good time in the midst of all the gore and silliness, the film is entertaining.The story pushes everything to the extremes but in short the story has been summarized as follows: The evil Ravenna (Charlize Theron) finds that her sister Freya (Emily Blunt) is pregnant and in love with a noble. Freya gives birth to a baby girl but her lover murders the baby unleashing her rage and her ice powers ice powers and she kills the father. Freya heads to North and builds a palace and an army that captures children from the villages to be raised as soldiers without love. Years later, their children Eric (Chris Hemsworth) and Sara (Jessica Chastain) are grown-up and unfortunately in love ? breaking the sole law of Freya's reign. As they plan to flee Freya discovers their secret love and builds an ice wall between them. Eric sees Sara being murdered stabbed on her back by their friend Tull (Sope Dirisu) and Eric is dumped into a frozen river but survives. Eric grieves the death of his beloved Sara on a daily basis. One day, Snow White is ill and her husband seeks out Eric to tell that the Magic Mirror was taken while carried to a place called Sanctuary. Eric teams-up with four dwarfs (Nick Frost, Rob Brydin, Sheridan Smith, Alexandra Roach) to find the mirror, but they are attacked by Freya army and saved by Sara who is alive. And on and on to disappearing evil queens and love conquers all.Overdone is an understatement, but as mentioned before the degree of tongue in cheek humor (especially from Hemsworth) keeps the tale afloat. And the special effects are indeed spectacular!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Somehow it felt like I've seen this movie before, and not because I've watched the first one. Well, the first movie was just a base, with some mentions of Snow White here and there and, of course, the evil Queen. However, other than that, the film makers seemed to have forgotten what happened in the first film. I mean, if I remember correctly, Eric had a wife who was killed by the Queen for her beauty, and, in the end, he fell in love with Snow white. Not to mention, the Queen's brother and other things that were simply "forgotten". Other than that, the movie was like a remake of the hobbit series. Sara gave the feel of an elf, the goblins and of course the bird spies were awfully familiar. Now, the Queen's story was okay, but the romance was a little too weak to sustain the whole film. So, 2 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You're not going to get a deep story or much character buildup. Winter's Tale is a fantasy romp that gets by with an A list cast, amazing CGI, and some of the most flamboyant wardrobes you have ever seen. Hemsworth seems less interested this time around, and could pass for being drunk in about half the scenes. The women are generally good in their limited roles, they do as much as they can with the script they got.A few bits of humor had me laughing from the dwarfs, and it outshines the first film in this department. Will there be another film? Probably. Hopefully third time is the charm and they can come up with something more original.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you're one of the people who thought there needed to be a sequel to a film that was already adding nothing really new to the lore of Snow White, then at least you saw the first film. If you didn't see the first film, then you're in luck because you don't have to in order to watch this one. This prequel/sequel is only cosmetically related to 2012's Snow White and the Huntsman. I mean that in both a good way and a bad way. The two films share some of the same cast-- Chris Hemsworth, Charlize Theron, Nick Frost--but feels weighed down by the fact that its predecessor wasn't at all as amazing as its trailer lead us to believe.But let's, for a moment, judge this movie solely on its own being, and not based on how necessary it is or the demerits of its predecessor.The first installment ends the same way all Snow White adaptations end, except for there being an ambiguous endearment between Snow White and Eric the Huntsman (Hemsworth).Snow White isn't in this movie. She's mentioned and silhouetted, but basically omitted. Which is fine. She was probably the worst part of the first one anyway.Even better, we get a couple of cool additions to the cast in Emily Blunt and Jessica Chastain-- both of whom do a superb job in their respective roles of the Snow Queen and Sara, the huntsman's wife.When I say this installment acts as a prequel AND a sequel, it means that it shows the origins of how Eric becomes the huntsman and how he meets Sara, but then flashes forward 7 years after she dies (we know this from the first film).The sequel portion of the story has the huntsman setting out on a journey to find the magic mirror, which Snow White sends away after it starts making her go crazy and homicidal. This is where the plot gets hairy. It's never clear why the mirror is making her mad, nor how she has the consciousness to send it away, nor why the huntsman needs to retrieve it even though Snow White wants it gone to begin with.The magic mirror is a MacGuffin in the worst sense. Not only do we not need it as a plot device, but we're not even really sure why it's a plot device. There could've been a more sensible reason why Eric and the dwarfs set out on their quest.The action sequences are, at times, ridiculous and silly--over-saturated with shaky cam so you just accept what's happening. But the thing is, we would've been just as fine without the nausea.There's plenty of levity from the dwarfs, played by Frost and Rob Brydon. The jokes are a fairly even mixture of both hits and misses. But it's okay, at least it keeps the movie fun and not too self-aggrandizing. That is, until it wants to be self-aggrandizing. Jarring tonal shifts and an overly jokey Hemsworth all of a sudden make us confused about what feel we're supposed to be getting.There's a lot of meandering somewhere in the middle of the story. The journey to the mirror isn't half as exciting as it should be. Nonetheless, The Huntsman tops its predecessor, not on essentiality, but on a unique premise.Twizard Rating: 79</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>not bad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off, I like these stories though I don't think a few of the cast ever truly fill the shoes of their character; but it is just another film. The Huntsman: Winter's War (2016) is a fairly good film and it follows the Snow White and The Huntsman story very well. My personal opinion about the film is the love story spots, did they really need so many and of course how on Earth during such events in all films do they tend to have the time to stop for such a moment.The Huntsman: Winter's War (2016) turned out to be pretty good, I did like it; though I liked Snow White and The Huntsman better. Maybe it was the story line or the acting made it a bit more stronger. The Huntsman: Winter's War (2016) had it's moments, the story was fair and the cast was pretty much the same; I guess this one just didn't quite live up to expectations for such a story based on the marketing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This flick exposes Disney's FROZEN for the fairy tale lie that it is . . .</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>. . . as THE HUNTSMAN: WINTER'S WAR is so real it could be ripped from Today's headlines. One does not need to be a subject of the British Crown to recognize Ravenna, Freya, and the Incinerated Royal Waif as Princesses Elizabeth, Margaret, and Diana. I have seen newsreel footage from the 1940s of the young Liz and Peggy, and even that far back close observation will prove that there's a lot more of Lizzie Borden than Betty Boop lurking in the future QEII's eyes. Born in a country that featured the English Monarch on its coins until the 1940s, Charlize Theron nails down Elizabeth's Regal Airs to a T. Emily Blunt is well-cast as the doomed Margaret, thwarted in love by a heavy-handed older sister. Diana's part is greatly down-sized here, since an Ice Queen makes for better special effects than some cry-baby scribbling in her diary. But no Real Life Royal Family has exhibited the sibling peace of FROZEN. The HUNTSMAN series shows Royals as they really are.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Really Good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I saw the previews for this movie I was like "oh! I want to see that!" I also had seen and owned the 1st movie "Snow White". I honestly thought that this movie was better than the 1st. I love Chris Hemsworth and he did an excellent job as the huntsman in both movies. I was kind of hoping for Kristen Stewart to be in this one and it probably would have made it even better, but oh well. I loved the characters in the movie, they fit perfect. Eric and Sara were my favorite and I loved the love they had for each other. So cute. I was so happy that Sara really didn't die, but when she came back I was shocked and kind of like "What!" I thought that maybe it was Queen Freya, but like Eric said that ice wall made each of them see different things. I loved the dwarfs, they were lively and comical and cute. Good movie overall though. After you watch Snow White &amp; the Huntsman it all kind of all come together.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Huntsman Fantasizes about The Lord of the Rings</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This review contains total spoilers!!! There was one reason I wanted to see The Huntsman: Winter's War. It was this.Chris Hemsworth.I also love swords and chain-mail. I sat through 2 hours and 24 minutes of Kingdom of Heaven in the theater and will still watch it while channel surfing. The Huntsman has all the ingredients for a perfect film, IMO: swords, archery, fantasy, and a great cast. However, it is loosely based on my least favorite fairy tale: Snow White.But The Huntsman isn't quite based on this fairy tale. Yes, there is a huntsman who the evil queen orders to take Snow White into the woods and murder and return with her heart so she can eat it. (I'm starting to think I know where the term "grim" came from.) But considering Emily Blunt's character, you could argue it is a retelling of the Hans Christian Andersen Snow Queen fairy tale because we haven't seen an ice queen on the silver screen recently.But The Huntsman is more than that. It is Snow White meets The Snow Queen meets Frozen meets Lord of the Rings meets The Chronicles of Narnia meets Romancing the Stone meets pretty much every cliché out there. If you have no expectations, if you think this movie will be awful, you might enjoy it a little. I did.The beginning narration is torturous to get through. It felt as if we were being read the story like children at bedtime. But at some point it disappeared. Perhaps I just quit listening once Chris Hemsworth showed up. The film couldn't decide if it was a dark drama or a rambunctious action/adventure or a tortured romance. The tone was all over the place.So were The Lord of the Rings references. Eric (Chris Hemsworth) is a master tracker, much like Aragorn, who is on a quest to find and destroy a round, golden item that whispers menacingly to those near it and possesses them. Nope. Haven't seen that before. He senses that he and his band of hobbits, I mean dwarfs, have to get off the road, so they flee to Bree, I mean some other town at night in pouring down rain and seek refuge in the Prancing Pony, or identical tavern.After his formerly dead wife Sara (Jessica Chastain) saves his ass, Eric, Sara, and the dwarfs set off to capture the ring, I mean the mirror, from goblins, who have more in common with Smaug than orcs. They get caught up in an Ewok trap, befriend their captors who agree not to eat them but help them on their quest through the forest via paddling boats on a river. I half expected to see Eric turn dramatically to the shoreline, sensing the Uruk-hai hot on their trail.Instead, they retrieve the mirror, cross a Romancing the Stone-esq bridge of vines, and are confronted by Queen Freya (Emily Blunt) on a giant snow -- something? I don't know what that animal was, but it was straight out of The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe. Sara betrays Eric and hands the mirror over to Queen Freya, who commands that she kills her husband. Her shot is true and Eric falls, but it hits the medallion that binds their love which prevents a fatal wound. Eric's alive and as plucky as ever with his wink and a smile as he sets out on what he describes as a horrible plan but, hey, at least it is simple. After a fight between the Huntsman and the queens (because, oh yeah, Charlize Theron is back in the movie after being the mirror, or something), love conquers all.Outside of the evil queen, Ravenna, there's little Snow White in the film. There's little Ravenna as well. They must've only been able to secure one week of shooting with Theron, so the powers that be told the writers to limit her scenes and the locations she's in.The Huntsman also borrows heavily from Frozen. Two royal sisters, one with ice-freezing magical powers, are estranged from each other due to one falling helplessly in love with a brunette. There's no act of true love that saves them in The Huntsman. Spoiler Alert #1**** They both die. But Emily Blunt's character sacrifices herself for her "children" in a twisted, almost redemptive story arc. Her character was the one I remain the most conflicted about. Charlize Theron you saw coming a mile away. Spoiler Alert #2**** You knew she was the real antagonist who killed Emily Blunt's baby the moment you saw the flames in the tower, so not a shocking reveal at the end. She's just crazy bitch #1. Chris Hemsworth's Eric is lovable enough. He has some comedic moments that helped keep me invested in the story, but his character has no arc and arguable is not the protagonist. Chastain was decent. You never knew where her character stood, which was refreshing in contrast to Theron. But Queen Freya is the complex character and the one who actually goes through character transformations.Should you go see The Huntsman: Winter's War? That's for you to decide. Besides stealing from numerous books and films and having a tonal confusion, it's a fun popcorn movie. Reasons to see it: great actors, gorgeous costumes, funny moments, and the creepiest white owls around. Reasons not to: it's just not that great of a movie. But I'll probably still watch it while channel surfing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Love can conquer ice.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"There's another story - one you have not seen," insists narrator Liam Neeson, whose voice is so recognizable it hardly matters that his name remains uncredited. Unfortunately, even though his delivery is typically enough to convince audiences of anything, "The Huntsman: Winter's War" proceeds to prove him wrong. The story is so commonplace and derivative of other popular fairy tales that it is absolutely not a new telling of anything at all. From "Frozen" to "Conan the Barbarian" to "The Hunger Games" to "The Lord of the Rings," this latest follow-up to an inexplicably successful property copies so many ideas that it's impossible to pick out any fresh material whatsoever.While calculating temptress Ravenna (Charlize Theron) seduces kings and murders them to ascend to power, her younger sister Freya (Emily Blunt) pursues the ideals of romance and becomes enamored with a young man promised to another. When she's brutally betrayed by her lover, the heartbroken young girl leaves her sister and heads to the lands in the north to create her own kingdom ? one where love is outlawed and fear, intimidation, and bloodlust are the only virtues. Raising all her conquered enemies' children to be her soldiers, Freya creates a massive and ferocious army.Despite her oppressive rules, Freya's best huntsman, Eric (Chris Hemsworth), and her finest archer, Sara (Jessica Chastain), fall in love - only to be savagely separated when the embittered queen uncovers their crime. Years pass and Eric goes on to aid Snow White in vanquishing Ravenna in the southern lands, revealing a short era of peace. But it's not long before Ravenna's magic mirror is discovered to be harboring a powerful evil, prompting Snow White to entrust Eric in disposing of the relic. When Freya learns the whereabouts of her sister's mystical heirloom, she becomes determined to acquire it first, forcing Eric to embark on a dangerous quest to stop the "ice queen" from attaining the almighty artifact.Even though Charlize Theron whispers or growls her lines solely to portray evilness or formidability (like Batman, it would seem), it's not enough to hide the pitifulness of the dialogue. When the first act is composed almost entirely of references to chess moves, it's obvious how generic this plot of good-versus-evil will turn out. At the same time, every gesture, no matter how insignificant, is emphasized for overdramatic grandeur, embellished with slow-motion movements and run-of-the-mill grimaces or intense stares (the modern-day equivalent of stroking a curvy, oily mustache). And then there's the strange attempt to create sympathy for the loveless, merciless child soldiers and their eventual perpetuation of the cruel indoctrination of other young slaves.Nevertheless, the loss of Kristen Stewart in this prequel - which bizarrely acts as a sequel simultaneously, thanks to its jumps in time and the humorously suspicious on screen absence of Snow White herself - should have been a boon to the production. Instead, it's possible the result is something as bad or even worse than before, with unexplained magic run amok and lavish set designs and special effects that trump any attempt at storytelling and character development. It's evident through Theron's costume, hair, and makeup changes - even during the course of a single scene - that the focus of this film dwells on visuals over plot. And while those visuals are fairly impressive, they can't distract enough to make the movie effective.In the end, "The Huntsman: Winter's War" becomes just another indistinguishable medieval combat or swords-and-sorcery fantasy epic. PG-13 axe fights are forced to use confusing editing to hide any potential bloodshed (as well as the PG-13 sex scene that awkwardly conceals nudity before hastily cutting to black), while henchmen huntsmen employ exhaustingly standard forms of villainy to ensure audiences don't accidentally confuse them for protagonists. The storyline regularly goes off in tangents, such as bringing up a quest to overthrow Snow White, despite the fact that she's not relevant to any of the ongoing activities, or questioning who the fairest person in the land might be, even though that has nothing to do with Freya's kingdom-conquering objectives or even Ravenna's reincarnation ambitions. It's all so sloppily mixed together and poorly written, even though the A-list cast opts to take their parts seriously (save for the dwarfs, who serve absolutely no purpose outside of comic relief - and, amidst all the current controversy about actor inequality and Hollywood whitewashing, aren't played by real little people). At least, audiences are treated to the new moral that love can conquer ice.- The Massie Twins</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Passable Snow White Chronicles</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I must admit that my expectations are quite high for this film since the last Snow White Chronicles was a bit disappointing. The addition of Jessica Chastain has really elevated my hopes for this movie since she is not a kind of an actress willing to pay any kinds of movies offered on the table. However, my hope floats when apparently the plot is all over the place. Sometimes it can be very intriguing but other times it is running really flat. The jokes also don't pull off and seem to ruin the essence of the movie. Emily Blunt is really awesome as the ice queen but her motivation to ruin people's lives seems to be overexposed.. The chemistry between Hemsworth and Chastain is unquestioned. I personally think that if it weren't for all those A-lists actors and actresses like Hemsworth, Theron, Blunt or Chastain , this film would be none other than a passable B movie. So, watch this movie only if you have nothing else to watch but this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I, myself, am a staunch fantasy aficionado. I like everything about dragons, elves and giants. This flick, I didn't like at all. A far- fetched story, lame characters and unconvincing visuals. Rudimentary dwarfs are amusing at times, but they can't be called "a silver lining" in this case. The main disappointment is definitely that the glorious constellation headed by Charlize Theron is sacrificed in the name of simplicity and narrow-mindedness. I don't think the "poor victims" feel framed and ashamed, but judging by the gross-budget ratio, the divine justice prevails. I wasn't elated by the first "Huntsman", but this one is a complete disaster. Better re-watch "Willow" or something.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Never saw the previous movie, but actually liked this one</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Going into the theater, I had no reason to expect to like this movie. I mean I'm not part of the teenage girl target demographic. More importantly, I've never even seen the first movie! And I've heard nothing but negative reactions to the previous movie. Really, I was only seeing this movie because nothing else interesting was playing at my local theater. Yet I ended up enjoying this way more than I should have. This was a good movie!It's a fantasy fairy tale love story with martial arts fight scenes, dwarf humor, forest ape monsters, better magical battles than Harry Potter, and a live-action Queen Elsa. What more can you ask for? Comparing to recent action-fantasy movies, I'd rate this better than the Hobbit movies.Romance: It feels almost silly to admit, because this is a little girl's movie, but the romance here totally works. Jessica Chastain's facial expressions say it all, when she's not even talking, but just staring into Chris Hemsworth's eyes, I felt it. With that great musical score playing, seeing them stare at each other, you will feel it too. The love was real.Emily Blunt's ice queen has the other romance/tragedy story of the movie. She's more of a traditional fairy tale character, so we can forgive her for her irrational fairy tale behavior, but with that in mind, she masterfully sells the love and hate and sadness behind her character and also does so most effectively when she's not even talking and we see it all in her face. A lot of good face-acting in this movie.Humor: Lots of jokes thrown in there through Chris Hemsworth's sarcasm and his comedy dwarf friends. The comedy dwarfs were amusing enough and they actually got a lot of screen-time, because the movie kept cutting back to them to lighten up the mood. I haven't really liked Nick Frost in his Simon Pegg team-ups, but I didn't even recognize him here in the dwarf makeup, and he was actually pretty funny here. This is the best role I've seen him in. When he was being a conceited little annoyance in the tavern scene, that's funny stuff right there.Visuals: Apparently the director started out as an visual effects artist and it shows. This movie is visually spectacular, not just in terms of CGI rendered/animated backgrounds/creatures/magic effects, but also in the color scheme, good looking shots, beautiful sets &amp; costumes, etc. It looks great is what I'm saying.Music: I think I would have liked this movie only half as much if the music wasn't so great. James Newton Howard does it again, proving he's one of the best movie composers working today. This score is hauntingly beautiful. I especially like the love theme of the Eric and Sarah. The vocal theme song, Castle by Halsey, is very catchy too.Criticism: If I had to criticize anything, I'd say I would have liked a wider look at this world. What's life like for the ordinary folk living in this world, under the rule of these queens? Aside from the queens, the soldiers/huntsmen, and Chris Hemsworth's little band of adventurers, are there even any ordinary people living in these kingdoms? Chris Hemsworth visits a tavern where there's only a couple of people in there, but that's about as much of a glimpse at the wider world as we get, outside of scenes of the queen's castle and Chris Hemsworth walking around in the woods/climbing snowy cliffs.Warning: The first trailer they released, "Trailer 1," is fine, but don't watch the subsequent ones if you can avoid them. They reveal too much of the plot.Anyway, I liked Huntsman: Winter's War enough to recommend to people I know and I'll actually seek out the first movie now, even though I didn't have any plans on seeing it before seeing this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not really my thing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not so much a sequel to 2012's Snow White and the Huntsman as a sandwich, this spin-off begins before the first film's action, then leapfrogs to seven years after it. Snow White figures in here in name only ? actress Kristen Stewart wasn't invited back to the party, I guess ? but we do reunite with the titular Huntsman (turns out his name is Eric), played as before with brawny, cocky cool by Chris Hemsworth. Snow White's villainess, Ravenna (Theron) returns, too, joined by a new character ? her sweet little sis, Freya (Blunt), who taps into her own evil urges after she gets burned by a lover. Now an ice queen who's frigid to love ? this movie is nothing if not on the nose ? Freya heads north, grooms an army of children to become an elite fighting force, and schools them in steeling their hearts against, well, their hearts: "Do not love. It's a sin, and I'll not forgive it." Despite Queen Freya's orders, young huntsman Eric and a sharpshooter named Sara (Chastain) trade hungry looks that swiftly progress to more than just undressing with their eyes; their rule-breaking love sets the course for the rest of the film. (A note to parents: There's a lot more boning here than you'd expect from a fairy tale-sourced story, and though the film cuts around the nudie bits, you should prepare yourself for a post-movie conversation about what consenting adults do when their clothes come off.) Tagging in for Rupert Sanders, first-time director Cedric Nicolas-Troyan was previously nominated for an Oscar for his work as visual effects supervisor on Snow White and the Huntsman, and justifiably so: The effects work was outstanding. But it was in service of a complete, breath-catching vision of this storybook land, each frame thrumming with energy, and complemented by an ambitious script that didn't always hit the mark but certainly had original ideas.But this follow-up is flat, prosaic. The effects don't have the same splendor, or terrifying menace, as the original. The second half's quest plot suffers from one unmemorable set-piece after another. The actors are all game, but the job's beneath them ? Hemsworth, a pro, and a real champ at faking enthusiasm for this dud; Theron, still doing camp but this time with no tempering complexity or empathy; Blunt, stuck playing a frost-bitten Mommie Dearest; and the digitally diminished "dwarfs," who get the best laughs with their bickering but suffer repeated jokes confusing dwarfs with children ? a tin-eared running gag from scripters Evan Spiliotopoulos and Craig Mazin, considering the already-dubious decision (carried over from the first film) to not cast actual little people in the roles."Predictable" is maybe a weird complaint to throw at a modernized fairy tale, the very nature of which is to traffic in well-worn tropes. But there is the kind of familiarity that feels epic ? worth revisiting because the material is so rich, and so ripe for riffing on. And then there is the kind of familiarity that just feels tired, and sad, and factory-engineered. The Huntsman misses epic by a long mile, and no amount of Hemsworth's obliging smiles can close that distance.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Huntsman: Winter's War continues with the adventures of The Huntsman/Eric(Chris Hemsworth), after Snow White and the Huntsman(2012). Eric &amp; Sara(Jessica Chastain) are members of The Huntsmen army raised by the ice queen, Queen Freya(Emily Blunt). Eric &amp; Sara fall in love. However, in the ice queen's kingdom, love is forbidden. Eric &amp; Sara escape from Freya's castle. Despite everything that is happening, The Huntsman soon realizes that, the evil Ravenna(Charlize Theron) might be back. The Huntsman: Winter's War is a great film. I liked it better than Snow White and the Huntsman(2012). Director Cedric Nicolas-Troyan, ably takes over the reins from previous director, Rupert Sanders. The visual effects are outstanding. The 3D is eye-popping &amp; transports you to this enchanting world. The climactic battle set piece involving, The Huntsman, Ravenna, Freya &amp; Sara is the highlight of the movie. Some superb new additions to the cast, makes this movie surpass the 2012 original. Chris Hemsworth is brilliant as The Huntsman/Eric. Charlize Theron is deliciously evil as Ravenna. Jessica Chastain is amazing as Sara. Emily Blunt is outstanding as Queen Freya. Blunt's portrayal of her conflicted character, is commendable. Chris Hemsworth &amp; Jessica Chastain, share electrifying chemistry on screen. Nick Frost &amp; Rob Brydon are hysterical as Nion &amp; Gryff, respectively. Sheridan Smith &amp; Alexandra Roach are awesome as Mrs. Bromwyn &amp; Doreena, respectively. Sam Claflin is effective as William. Sope Dirisu, Sam Hazeldine &amp; Sophie Cookson are impressive as Tull, Leifr &amp; Pippa, respectively. Conrad Khan, Niamh Walter &amp; Nana Agyeman-Bediako are superb as Young Eric, Young Sara &amp; Young Tull, respectively. The Huntsman: Winter's War is a must watch, for all people who love fantasy/adventure films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Dramatic War With Under Utilized Characters. What a World Though</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Snow white, a tale that has been beaten to death over the last five decades. From cute cartoon masterpieces to cheap knockoffs you can get the classic Grimm's tale in a variety of forms that you can deem the "fairest" of them all. This weekend, we get the sequel that drops Snow White and substitutes with her handsome, ax wielding sidekick Eric entitled The Huntsman: Winter's War. Can this tale succeed without the beautiful, raven-haired beauty, or will it fail like its predecessor? As always I'm Robbie K and this is my report on the latest movie.The GOOD: ? Beautiful visuals ? Fantastic Acting ? A nice portrayal of love ? Decent comedic reliefIf you remember the first movie Snow White and The Huntsman, you remember that the world was beautifully designed. Winter's War takes that trend and runs with it, filling the screen with a beautiful fantasy world that brings you into the fairy tale. Breathtaking shots of gorgeous countryside are intermingled with CGI creatures that are a blend of flora and fauna that reflect their very environment. The kingdoms that surround this wilderness are also well designed, the houses, temples, and palaces mirroring the personalities of their rulers, who themselves are in stunning costumes. But seldom do visuals make the movie by itself and fortunately Winter's War has a great cast to further bring the world to life. Chris Hemsworth leads the cast, playing the same role he always plays?the hot guy. Girls swooned in my showing over the smoldering grin and strong chin as he battled fictional enemies and argued with just about everyone. Fortunately he brings a balanced performance that contains fun, honor, love, and some choreography. The lovely Emily Blunt also brings her A game as the ice queen Freya. Her ability to play such an emotional and detailed role never ceases to amaze me and other than the ugly (guttural) crying she won my heart for favorite character. Jessica Chastain revisits her role of strong woman kicking lots of butt and being angry at everything, only this time with a strong (and comical) Scottish accent. While certainly not the most unique role, she still manages to pull the performance off with two thumbs up. Charlize Theron reprises her role once more as well, an arrogant , power hungry, ruthless queen who is a good example of the B word. And Theron plays it so well that you can't help but hate her for it. Actors aside the story is another generic tale about Snow White's kingdom. Once more we get a tale all about love and the twisted game it plays with us all. Despite the annoying broken record of its power, the movie does a nice job at capturing the magic of infatuation in more ways than one. While it can be preachy and overdramatic at times, it does hit home and the actor's portrayal of love is very well received. Throw in a comedic portrayal with the dwarfs and you have an entertaining love story. THE BAD: ? Very rushed story and a little underdeveloped ? Dulled down action with the other Huntsmen ? Character imbalanceHard to believe I'm saying this, but the love component was the best part of the whole movie. The rest of the plot was rather simplistic/rushed for me. Winter's War is shown as a prequel in the trailers, but it is actually a prequel and sequel, which I think was the problem. Our story team could not decide where it wanted to take the movie and as such tried to cover everything it could. The background of the huntsman was a montage of punching, only to quickly transition to the love component. This motive carries for all of the characters, leaving much of the cast underdeveloped and relying on superficial qualities (like looks) to latch on to. In addition, this uncoordinated plot was boring at times that I wanted to take a nap to make them pass faster. While the rushed story is a large hurdle to jump, the underutilization of characters is the bigger crime. Theron and Chastain have a much more dilute role than I thought and I was very disappointed that the former's role was pretty much portrayed in the commercial. This disproportional use of characters dropped wrenches in the cast dynamic and their conventional reentry into the world only made me laugh or shake my head. You would think that with big price tags they would get their money's worth, but sadly balance seems to remain an issue in Hollywood. Finally the action component. Good news is that the action is a step above the cataclysmic failure of the first installment. Bad news is it is still simple and kind of corny at parts. The Huntsmen are supposed to be elite warriors, but this movie downplayed this component and made them rather pathetic. Many battles were very corny bouts of extras standing in a circle, stern looks filling their faces before getting pummeled by the only warriors with skills. The special effects helped a little, but the excitement quickly waned as the momentum was starting to build. However, it does fit well with the theme of the movie and the world crafted by our studio. THE VERDICT:Winter's War is a decent love story with a blockbuster cast and gorgeous visual prowess. Unfortunately, it still feels like an underdeveloped story whose characters still haven't reached their potential yet. Should there be a third movie, I hope that we get more character development and some more bite to give the world some edge. Is it worth a trip to the theater? For a visual standpoint yes, but this reviewer thinks Winter's War should be reserved for a RedBox rent. My scores are:Action/Adventure/Drama: 7.5 Movie Overall: 6.0</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mirror Mirror...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Q: Mirror mirror on the wall, who is the most average of them all? A: The Huntsman: Winter's War. Bit of a review spoiler but I couldn't start any other way. I quite liked Snow White and the Huntsman and its Rings-lite re-imagining of the fairy tale. It took itself a bit seriously but there were some good effects and there was a scale to it. This is more of the same only with a lot more comedy and a lot less clarity. Chris Hemsworth reprises his huntsman role and is joined as one by a feisty Jessica Chastain in a story that is both prequel and sequel to Snow White, beginning afore and then skipping seven years when Emily Blunt's Frozen cash-in frost- queen goes ice-sh*t because of some pretty disturbing infanticide. What comes next is lightly entertaining. There are fights and feuds and illiberal borrowing from Tolkien (or Jackson): the Mirror is now a whispering, malevolent Ring for all intents, and we get dwarfs, goblins, murky inns, and questions regarding dwarf mating habits. It doesn't have the style or weight of Pete's films, not by half, not by a sixth, but it's enjoyable, especially when he-dwarfs Nion (Nick Frost) and Gryff (Rob Brydon) meet with their female counterparts Bromwyn (Sheridan Chase) and Doreena (Alexandra Roach). It is in the barbed repartee between the dwarf sexes that the film reaches its high points and there are some genuinely funny moments. The parallel battling between Chastain and Hemsworth is okay too, although for some reason both are burdened with Scottish accents that neither of them come anywhere near to pulling off, and to distracting effect, but it's all fine. And then we come to the third act where it falls in a muddle right up to its middle. Events unfold that feel forced and lacking in emotional truth. It doesn't really feel like the culmination we have been heading towards. Shame. Oh, and for God's sake can people stop hiring Liam Neeson for stuff like this? His Aslanic sagacity in a tiresome and overused voice- over feels worn out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>And Hour and a Half of How Unemployable Kristen Stewart is</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As the title suggests, the movie follows Chris Hemsworth's Huntsman, and plays as both prequel and sequel to the first film. We get a bit of backstory to his character, including the love and death of his wife, intimately linked in with the story of the Ice Queen, sister to the Evil Queen Ravenna, who's slighted by her lover and retreats to the north to forge her own kingdom. Jump to after the events of Snow White and the Huntsman, and the Mirror has gone missing. The Huntsman is recruited to find it, but it's disappearance also sparks the interest of Freya, the Ice Queen.I found the story, surprisingly enough, a little confusing, and the reason being the marketing for the movie was, in hindsight, horrendous. The trailers all revealed too much, so I knew there was more to come, but couldn't figure in how. Turns out the big twists of the movie are completely spoiled in the trailers, the biggest of which being Ravenna's presence and her fight with Freya. This is literally the final climax at the very end of the movie, so when you jump forward in time, you know that Ravenna is going to return and that Freya is going to have a change of heart. And yet despite the sequel angle, Snow White herself is entirely absent. It's like an hour and a half of how uncastable Kirsten Stewart is. All we see is a dark haired girl in anguish in front of the mirror (in a confusing and badly placed flashback no less). Any plot with her that was set up in the first movie is completely forgotten, and let's just ignore the Huntsman's flirting in the first movie when this one wants us to believe he's only ever had eyes for his dead wife.I haven't really got any complaints on the acting side of things though, so that's nice. Chris Hemsworth is just as charming and likable as he was the first time around, with that stereotypical Scottish accent in tow. Jessica Chastain is pretty good as his wife as well, although her Scottish accent leaves a little to be desired at times. I did find it amusing that the Australian and the American are the ones who play Scots. Charlize Theron is actually much better this time around, reigning in her over-the-top villainy just a little...or maybe that was just thanks to her limited screen time. Emily Blunt's Freya makes for a more interesting and conflicted antagonist, and she shows every degree from innocent and naive to ice cold and ruthless perfectly.Nick Frost returns as his dwarfish character, this time with his half brother played by Rob Brydon. Between Brydon and another new dwarf played by Alexandra Roach (Utopia), I left the screening with a refined Welsh accent. Again the dwarfs are the comedic relief (including an amusing scene where they swap typically British insults at each other), but I still couldn't help but wonder why they didn't just cast actual dwarfs in those roles, instead forking out a lot of time and money into dwarfifying these full-size actors.Talking of effects, that's another place where I have very little criticisms. Once again the dwarfifying is flawless, but there's a lot more as well with the introduction of magical ice. The Ice Queen's powers are so detailed, with ice crystals in flux as she summons and manipulates them. The return of Ravenna is also welcomed with some impressive effects work, as a golden, silky sheet oozes out from the mirror, somehow appearing liquid and fabric simultaneously. There's also the design work on some of the creatures. We meet Goblins this time around and they look great. Imagine hairless, black chimpanzees with ram's horns covered in gold. The Ice Queen also owns what appears to be a large Direwolf, which could've been real if my wisdom told me otherwise.It's not all a winner in the visual department though, as the action leaves a lot to be desired through the simple fact that I have no idea what was going on in most of the sequences. The mixture of dark environments, close-up shots, and shaky-cam resulted in every fight scene just being a blur. The worst culprit for this was when the Huntsman fights a group from the Ice Queen's army in a tavern, and you can't tell anyone apart, there's blades flying everywhere, but you can't tell who from, at who, or where they ended up.I find it hard to say The Huntsman is a bad movie. I didn't overly enjoy it myself, but I think I was predisposed not to. The effects work is great to watch, and the acting, while not Oscar-worthy, provides most of the movie's charm and entertainment. There's a handful of great comedic moments that serve to boost the mood a bit, but the story feels a bit forced and strained at times. I didn't really see the need to bring back Ravenna beyond the fact Charlize Theron made her a fan favourite of the first movie. Maybe they didn't think the Ice Queen was a good enough antagonist to have by herself? And not even a cameo appearance from Stewart really spoke volumes. I give it a 6/10, roughly on par with the first movie:- Better in some ways, worse in others.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Bitter Disappointment | Review of 'The Huntsman: Winter's War'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie had so much potential, but all of it went down the drain. At first look, it seems like a great move for Universal to distance itself from Stewart and the director Rupert Sanders of the previous film because some bad press is bad press. That scandal hurt sales, everyone knows it, and it did not receive many great reviews, probably the biggest fault in the previous was the story which wasn't praised. This film, while written by different people, suffers that same problem.It is such a thin story. It exists, there is something tangible that holds this film together, but as a whole, it's rather sloppy and the Queen's themselves, Theron and Blunt, they don't get enough screen time as they should have to bring this film to life in a cohesive manner. Winter's War recaps the Huntsman past and gives the origins of the Ice Queen, Freya, (Emily Blunt), that itself leads to some discrepancies regarding the Huntsman's role in the previous film, but the biggest problem here is it takes too long. The film moves at a snail's pace. It takes about an hour and more to get to the damnable evil mirror before it finally speeds up, and brings back the evil queen, Ravenna (Charlize Theron) who gave an incredible performance. Theron and Blunt have a powerful dynamic in this film, and as evil queens, they are very different, giving their characters different strengths and weaknesses. However, they were hardly in the movie. All of Theron's screen time is in the various trailers, adding up to about 20 to 25 minutes of the film. There should have been more of her; there should have been more of the Queen's, in general, to give the story an actual story line that doesn't fall apart at the seams. Yes, the movie is about the Huntsman (Chris Hemsworth) and yeah, he was funny, he gave an excellent performance alongside Jessica Chastain, who was also great to watch, but their story, their forbidden love story, it was neither unique nor powerful.This movie feels empty, insubstantial in its story making. It almost feels as if the writers just wanted to capitalize on the Frozen popularity while it is still high. Once Upon a Time did that, but they were successful because they wrote a story not just around Elsa but also the original Snow Queen. Given all the material out there on the Snow Queen, the writers at least got her character right, but that's it, even a great performance by Blunt cannot save the character from an empty story line. She wants to control; she wants power, and she wants to dominate? Her motivation doesn't reflect her pain or explain her actions, stealing kids does, but waging war doesn't. Moreover, her reasoning for wanting the mirror is unclear. Does she want it for its power? Does she want it because it once belonged to her sister? Clear motivation is lacking in this story, and with two evil queens, it should have been action packed, it should have been captivating and enthralling, but the story is a mess. The only thing that moves throughout the film is the fact that Hemsworth needs to get the mirror away from the Queen and destroy it.With so much potential and renowned actors, this movie could have been something great instead of the bitter disappointment that it was.Check out more reviews at https://cynsworkshop.wordpress.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Movie Is Good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wow I wonder why the bad review of this movie could become on the top of the list of the reviewer? For me the plot is good not too complicated and was direct-to-the-point, the casts. are acting good even though Chris's English is a bit difficult to understand, the settings are beautiful, Freya's (Emily Blunt) gowns are stunning and heavy I guess with the embedded crystal on it.For 1h50m this movie is totally worth to watch.I like how I became sympathize with Blunt's character, she was portraying her character well not too cruel but kept her icy front to protect her inner heart. While Theron as usual always gives the best to her acting. Hemsworth's acting is so so not to different with his other characters, the rest are fine. I even like the dwarfs here they were really funny and into their characters.Overall compare to the snow white and the huntsman this movie is much better since the heroine (I'll say the heroine is Blunt's character) can acting, no offense but Kristen Stewart only has pretty face but cannot do acting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So much better than SWATH</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The huntsman: winters war (2016) is a very worthy prequel and sequel to SWATH. It surpasses the first film in quality, acting performances, storyline, visual effects, and costumes. First, the costumes: they were absolutely magnificent! Ravenna's gold dress is so stunning and it suits her evil persona very well. Blunt's Ice Queen/Freya costume is well designed and fits her role well too. As for the actor's performances, they were great all around. The best here is by far Charlize Theron, she really killed it in her effortlessly evil character Revenna. And I thought Blunt was the right choice for Freya, she really portrayed the heartbroken, turned evil from horrible tragedy persona well, she was emotionless, which is exactly what her character required of her. Chris Hemsworth is better here than he was in the first film, he brings more heart, power, and soul to his character, Eric. And as for Jessica chastain, she didn't really own her role, but she wasn't bad in the film, it's just that her performance was a little overshadowed by her co-stars. The visuals effects were so mesmerizingly stunning! The atmosphere of the movie is perfect! It makes you feel exactly how you should while watching. The fight between Revenna and Freya is my favorite effects scene, that's the scene where the awesome special effects really burst through, that scene honestly gave me goosebumps because it was so powerful. The other fight scenes are very well done too, high octane and exciting to see. The chemistry between all the characters is great too, Blunt and Theron really do have an electric on screen energy together. Chastain and Hemsworth have a good romantic energy, it's sweet and believable. This movie is for sure worth your time. I give the huntsman: winters war an 8/10. 4 points higher than Snow White and the huntsman.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Worthy Sequel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before I say anything, I must say that this film is definitely for those who enjoyed the first movie despite its many flaws (Kristen Stewart). If you haven't seen Snow White and The Huntsman, I suggest you do because some plot points and character interactions may go over your head.Now for the movie itself, overall it is 100% a love story. So if you're going in expecting a whole bunch of Lord Of The rings type fight scenes you will be disappointed. Once you accept that fact, you can enjoy this movie. The story is pretty surface level. There were times where I really wanted them to delve deeper into certain aspects of a character's life, especially Freye The Ice Queen, just so I can be a little more connected to her transformation from good to evil. But Emily Blunt's performance was Grade A. She's very ruthless and unapologetic on her views but I wish we could have actually SEEN her going to battle with other kingdoms. I wish they would have shown her Huntsman in their element, conquering armies, etc. but we didn't. Some of the subject matter deserved a bigger world but like I said, it's a love story FIRST and everything else afterward.Charlize Theron didn't get as much screen time as I had hoped because she was soooooo good in the first one but I was okay with that.All the visuals in this movie are beautiful. The costumes, the special effects are amazing. I was happy that they kind of explored the world a little bit more. Even though the title is The Huntsman, I felt that this was more Freya's movie than Chris' or Jessica Chastain. I'm not sure what else to say...it's not a bad movie, it just wont blow you away. It will definitely be enjoyed more by those who were fans of the first one (as I stated earlier). IT did what it was supposed to do and capitalized off of people's love of villains (Voldemort, Miranda Priestley, Ravenna, Maleficent, etc.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better Than I Expected</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Might not be movie of the summer, but it was definitely better than Batman v Superman in my opinion. Had a better story, much livelier acting, and it actually had a villain that you wanted to see destroyed. Actually, it had two villains who were about as villainous as you could get.Here's my breakdown on the movie:Plot: 9/10 The story was good, giving the back story of the Huntsman and where he came from before picking up after the events of Snow White and the Huntsman. Really good job here. Character Development: 10/10 Perfect character development for all the characters in this movie, including Ravenna, who you thought would have had her story told in the first movie. She actually got a better story here, as did the Huntsman.Direction: 8/10 The way the story was told as a partial back story and partial after story for Snow White was handled very well. Casting: 10/10 Perfect casting all around. I wouldn't change anyone.Acting: 9/10 Charlize Theron really threw herself into Ravenna again. Emily Blunt was so awesome as the cold- hearted Ice Queen, Freya. Chris Hemsworth reprised his role of The Huntsman to great effect. I have to say Jessica Chastain was great as Sara, but she did slightly bring the movie down in my opinion. Not horribly in any way, but she just didn't seem to be as into as everyone else. My opinion on that could change on another viewing, however.Cinematography: 10/10 Movie was beautiful to look at. Think Snow White and the Huntsman but better. Even the melting mirror looked better here.Music: 10/10 Beautiful and fit the movie perfectly. It didn't overwhelm you but fit into the background nicely.Pacing: 8/10 There was a point where I started to wonder how far from the end we were. But then things immediately picked up again and concluded satisfyingly. Still, if I have to check my watch even once, I take points away. The first act was good, the middle act was a little slow, but the third act was perfect.Sets and Costumes: 10/10 Everything in this category looked really great in this movie. Ravenna...wow!Re-Watchability: 9/10 This probably isn't a movie you'll want to immediately see again, and chances are I may not go see it again in theater, but I will love to own this on digital when it gets released for home video.Final Grade: 93/1009.3/10A</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A bit shambolic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wicked queen Ravenna's kid sister Freya is quite nice really. But when the mirror tells Ravenna that Freya's daughter will grow up to be more beautiful than her, Ravenna arranges for a little "accident" to befall the baby. Freya is so distraught that she goes full Elsa (Frozen reference: freezes up her kingdom etc.) and kidnaps kids to train them as her army. One of of them, the Huntsman, is full grown he goes off on a quest involving a search for the mirror, his missing love Sara, and assorted dwarfs. Blahdy blahdy blah.If you didn't know that the Wicked Queen and the Huntsman from Snow White And The Huntsman had previous history, well you do now. The best thing about this film is that there is no Kirsten Stewart (apart from a brief glimpse in the mirror). The special effects are quite good fun and, as with the previous one, there is a good sense of both atmospheric reality, and also funky magic. And Nick Frost, Rob Bryden, Sheridan Smith and Elexandra Roach all have fun as the four dwarfs.The less wonderful aspects are that the story is horribly muddled and badly told, Hemsworth's accent wanders around as much as it did in Snow White (as does Jessica Chastain's), Chastain herself seems shoehorned in, Charlize Theron does pantomime villainy again, and Emily Blunt's Freya is unconvincingly written. In fact, this film has an air about it of having been rescued ? badly ? from the Sanders/Stewart debacle following Snow White.This isn't a disaster, but it's a long way from being 100% successful.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>fantastic film, critics need to chill!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Saw this just now, not a big fan of the first, thought it was eh!!! not expecting anything, deliberately did not see reviews to sway my opinion.For the second time in a short while critics have polarized themselves against public opinion, aka in need of stick removal surgery from the rear.This movie was fantastic. it didn't try too hard, it was just trying to tell a great fairy tale and i was hooked the whole way thru. i was impressed with the sfx, especially the dwarfs, normal sized actors on the heads of smaller actors, it looked photo real, did not falter once. the visuals were stunning, the whole way thru i was thinking this is a great lord of the ring substitute, or game of thrones.critics complained about the usual, lack of story, characterization, they were obviously busy with minds elsewhere while the movie was on, they may actually have seen the complex intriguing plots and subplots on show here about betrayal and love and hope above all else.charlize stole the show again playing the she bitch and she was DA bomb, love her, best part of the last one i can remember. she is not in it the whole movie as Emily blunt steps in as the main ice bitch.so if you want to just ignore critics from now on and take notice of the user public score as it is more accurate of enjoyment until critics partake in anus stick-us removal-us surgery.the movie hints at a sequel, and I'm more surprised than anything that I'm excited, it makes the first one watchable again as it builds the universe it is creating. i hope Kristen appears in the next one as snow white if they make one, no one cares about the affair with the director on the last movie except Donald trumps tweets, frozen water under bridge.see the movie have fun, believe in love above all obstacles and doubt.7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Decent fantasy flick with some beautiful visuals</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw the first part and liked Charlize Theron as Ravenna and Chris Hemsworth as Huntsman Eric, but overall I was not too impressed by it.This prequel/sequel takes what I liked about the first film and removed most of what I disliked to make a decent if not particularly special fantasy action adventure.We learn about the Huntsman's background and his wife, Sarah, who was mentioned in the first film. Also, we find out Ravenna has a sister, Freya, played by Emily Blunt. Charlize Theron delightfully plays it up as evil Queen Ravenna again, and I am a little disappointed that she did not get more screen time. The first scene with Ravenna playing chess with her royal husband is the best scene in the film. Then she disappears for half the movie. Also, I wish she would have had more scenes with her sister to show more of their relationship. I don't remember if Ravenna had a sister in the first film, but even if she did, we knew nothing about her.There is a creative interpretation of goblins in this film, which I will not give away. The visuals are overall pleasing to the eye, especially the climax has some beautiful visual effects. I enjoyed it a lot more than the previous film's awkward fight in the end. That said, the fight scenes are shot with much too many cuts for a 3D audience, a common problem with films wanting to cash in on the 3D feature but putting no thought into how a film has to be shot differently from 2D for a 3D audience. There is a scene with CGI animals akin to what we saw in the first film, which went too over the top for my taste (and the animals don't look too convincing - you can see they are CGI).The plot is very straight forward but apart from the common problem RPG pen &amp; paper groups have, namely that not everybody has a reason to join the adventure, it was fine. Seriously, the dwarf characters were obviously there for comic relief but they added little to nothing to the plot and I did not understand why they accompanied the Huntsman in the first place.The resolution comes too quickly in my opinion, it would have been better to linger more on the consequences of the second turning point. It feels rushed and doesn't explore the feelings of our characters very much, going rather straight to the action.One thing the film does very well is including female characters as something other than decoration. There is a 50:50 gender split when it comes to the main characters (didn't catch if it was the same with extras, sorry) and the female characters have a purpose and motivation without being sexualised or treated as eye candy. This is something severely lacking in most fantasy films, so I want to compliment the film makers for doing a good job on that front. Well done!Overall, I give it 6 out of 10. Enjoyable, decent fantasy flick, but nothing special. I would not necessarily watch it again, but also wouldn't be opposed if someone else wanted me to watch it with them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A solid fantasy adventure despite not bringing anything new to the genre.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought Snow White And The Huntsman was serviceable at best with some nice visual effects and a good villain role by Charlize Theron. Naturally, I would probably not be interested in a sequel.But as I am usually a sucker for fantasy and I was intrigued by the trailer and who was cast, I thought I would give it a chance.I was going in with low expectations and felt pretty satisfied with what I saw. It is better and more enjoyable than its predecessorThe best things about it are definitely the costume designs and visual effects. You can tell hard work has been made with the costumes, especially for our main female characters. They are impressive to look at and definitely fit in with the magical kingdom that it is set in. Whilst admiring the costumes, the visuals around it fits in well and the general viewing experience is a highly positive one for the eyes.Even the performances managed to boost my enjoyment. As I mentioned before, the casting choices for this film heavily influenced me in giving this a chance. Everyone involved I consider to be reliable choices that seem to make any potentially disappointing film worth watching. Chris Hemsworth continues to play the hero role well as The Huntsman. His fun and smiley presence makes it easy to root for him. I was really surprised to hear Jessica Chastain was a part of this and this seemed outside of her comfort zone. As a supportive role to Hemsworth, I thought she was perfectly fine on the whole, despite her questionable Scottish accent. Emily Blunt played the leading villain role well. I have been fond of Blunt's recent performances, especially in Edge Of Tomorrow. She was believable, threatening and even showed enough of a vulnerable side for us to also feel sympathy for her character. Charlize Theron is back as Ravenna, and is great as always. She constantly looks terrifying whenever she's on screen whilst also looking very attractive. There was also some solid minor roles by Nick Frost, Rob Brydon, Sheridan Smith, Sam Caflin and a nice surprise to see Colin Morgan on the big screen.The only negative that was noticeable was the comedy used. It seemed out of place at first but managed to slowly fit in as the film went along.Despite questioning the reasoning into a sequel being made, I was perfectly fine with the mash-up of the two fairy tales 'Snow White' and 'The Snow Queen' to give this sequel some logic as to why it is being made. Whilst giving this a lot of positives, it is mainly due to going into the film with low expectations. The best stuff is just not strong enough and the content does not bring anything new to the genre. It is lovely to look at, and the performances keep the film moving. If you look like the fantasy genre, then this will be a fine couple of hours.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not really looking forward to go see this one because I heard so many bad things about it. I did like the first one from 2012 but this one hear sadly wasn't my thing. It all starts great with the arrival between the two sisters and the growing up of children trained to become a huntsman but once a woman and man is chosen to be the best this flick turns into a romantic flick and with the arrival of the dwarfs it even became a bit ridiculous. In The Hobbit franchise the jokes made are funny but here they are a bit childish. The effects were okay but it was only at the end that I did like it. The fight between the sisters and the huntsman. But by then it was a bit too late to say that I really enjoyed it. But it's again Charlize Theron (Ravenna) who takes it to a higher level.

		<fullReview>In this sequel slash prequel slash spin off, the tale of Snow White is axed (poor Kristen Stewart)in favor of focusing on Eric the Huntsman. Winter's war tells the origin of Eric who as a child became a part of the Ice Queen's orphan army were he learned his skills, skills he would use later to help Snow White again. This time as the queen she needs him to find the mirror on the Wall before it's dark magic falls into the wrong hands.Charlize Theron reprises her role as Ravenna while Emily Blunt plays her little sister the Ice Queen, in a strange similarity to Disney's Frozen. Also new to the cast is the sensational Jessica Chastain, who plays Sara Eric's love interest in the movie.But the one to see is definitely Chris Hemsworth, who turned the Prince Charming bid up to 11, being a humorous action star in the same swashbuckling category as Errol Flynn. It feels like he's having so much fun and it gets me into it.Also want to mention Nick Frost as one of the dwarfs is hilarious as well. It's a great fairy tale on it's own and just an amazing adventure that's never boring.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'THE HUNTSMAN: WINTER'S WAR': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five)A spin-off to the 2012 fantasy adventure flick 'SNOW WHITE AND THE HUNTSMAN'; which serves as a sequel, and a prequel, to that hit film. The story was once again based on characters from the classic fairy tale 'Snow White' (by the Brothers Grimm), as well as 'The Snow Queen' (by Hans Christian Anderson). It was scripted by Evan Spiliotopoulos and Craig Mazin (this time around), and directed by first time feature filmmaker Cedric Nicolas-Troyan (who also did visual effects on the first movie). The story deals with the Huntsman (once again played by Chris Hemsworth) taking on a vengeful ice queen, named Freya (played by Emily Blunt); who's also the sister of the evil queen from the first movie, Ravenna (once again played by Charlize Theron). He has help from another female warrior, he also loves, named Sara (played by Jessica Chastain). Nick Frost also reprises his role, as the dwarf Nion. Kristen Stewart does not return as Snow White, although the character is mentioned (and briefly seen, from behind). I was a big fan of the original movie, when it came out, not so much this one.The film begins before (most of) the events of the original movie; with the sorceress Ravenna (Theron) becoming queen, by killing her husband (Robert Portal). Ravenna then also kills her sister's baby, in fear that she'll grow to become more beautiful than her (as her magical mirror warns). Ravenna's sister, Freya (Blunt), then becomes a powerful, and very vengeful, queen (of her own kingdom); ruling with deadly ice powers. She begins enslaving children, and training them to be obedient warriors; while also forbidding them from falling in love. When two warrior Huntsmen, Eric (Hemsworth) and Sara (Chastain), defy Freya's orders, she casts a powerful spell; which makes Eric believe Sara is dead. Eric then makes it his mission to stop the evil ice queen.The film has great visuals, and the cast couldn't be better (I'd trade Kristen Stewart, for both Jessica Chastain and Emily Blunt, any day). They're all wasted in this movie though, and Charlize Theron is barely in it (despite her demands for a $10 million payday; equal to Hemsworth's, who's on screen about four times as much). Theron was the best part of the original film, and she's awesome in this follow-up as well; I just wish they would have used a lot more of her. As it is, the movie is very slow-paced; and completely uninvolving. I hope the next spin-off is all about Queen Ravenna!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHm0V1TOCkg</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Outstanding end titles</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Unfortunately the best part were the closing titles: with visually astounding stuff like arrows flying in closeup slow motion or an axe breaking ice sculpture of a bird; accompanied by a song "Castle" by Helsey, slightly reworked for the movie to its benefit. And on top of that, those end titles simply did their job: they ended the movie, which happened to be a festival of averageness. Because this movie is not very bad. But it is just a waste of Hollywood's resourcesThis is a sequel that is a little better and more interesting than the quite bad first installment (which is a surprise and a good thing). But it is still only a waste of few good ideas and visual aspects, like an astounding architecture or a snake covered with skin made of grass (which are mostly repeated from the first film). And this movie is also a clear case of waste of acting by Charlize Theron and Emily Blunt near its end (which are counter parted throughout the movie with a performance by Chris "Cannot Act" Hemsworth). Even the music has only a few moments above the averageSo unless you like fantasy, action / adventure or Charlize Theron, you will not find in this picture anything of worth</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Decent Film If You Stay Away From the First One</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Huntsman: Winter's War is about two former huntsman warriors of the Ice Queen trying to capture the mirror and keep it away from the wrong hands. The Huntsman (Eric and Sara) are accompanied by dwarfs who bring the comedy to the film.As the summary says by itself I think the movie is okay not but really interesting and not very original. The movie reminded me of scenes from Lord of the Rings while the characters were similar to Game of Thrones. Eric and Sara were pretty similar to Ygritte and Jon Snow with their actions and overall relationship. The characters make clichéd and really dumb decisions along the way but I would still give the movie a 6/10. Oh, I almost forgot the main issue that took me out of the movie in about 10 minutes. They edit the film so that we see Freya go from a nice innocent girl into a loveless power hungry queen. I think it took three scenes, which is just a tad to fast for me. Since there is a film that precedes it; I have a lot more problems with it. The main plot hole was during the time of Snow White and the Huntsman, where was Freya? If she wanted the mirror so bad why didn't she attack the castle when the final battle was happening? She had her seeing owls to investigate the situation. Continuing with the owls, how is it possible after seven years she didn't overhear that Snow White was her daughter? I think that mystery would have been solved after Ravenna died.This movie should have just been a prequel with the two antagonist sisters battling as the true ruler and possessor of the mirror with the Eric and Sara caught in the middle. Instead we get a sequel that isn't very original, and just boring. 5/10 would not recommend seeing this unless you avoid the first film.I still don't understand why Emily Blunt and Jessica Chastain signed on to do this when the first one barely made its money back and wasn't well received. I understand that it is for the money but they are A Listers, they could be doing way better movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Josh Hewitt says as the title of his review ''Better than the previous one''. And i definitely agree with him. I go watch that movie on a boring afternoon, in fact, my boss give me some time off, i had work too much. And to celebrate that, i go to the theatre watching Winter's War, the story of The Hunstman from Snow White story... it's a new tale, and not a fairytale this time. It is not really gory or violent but i was impress, the battle sequences were very well done, the comedy factor was also there but not too much and the dwarfs (we got two) were awesome and funny.As for the acting, all of the cast do a good job... i read many things about this film. Like Charlize Theron and Chris Hemsworth receive the same amount of money. I'm mad at this because Charlize is in the film for not more than 15-20 minutes while Chris is always on screen physical like the 6'4, 220 pounds beast that he is. Jessica Chastain is the one that shines as she look innocent and not really the main character at first, but Emily Blunt is also another very good and interesting choice in the casting. She is always bringing her A game and she is phenomenal. Both beautiful and talented. It is my dream to see all theses actresses together. Emily Blunt looks so similar to Charlize, and is also tall.I recommend the film to people who love adventure and fantasy films like Ladyhawke or Red Sonja. But don't take it too seriously and don't have high hopes, you won't be disappointed !</fullReview>

Really.But I like how Emily Blunt has a good acting skill in this movie. I quite admire her. I mean this is not her best play but I'm impressed. And I want to talk how great the costumes are. I love all the costumes. Maybe this movie has a bit potential to nominated in Oscar for best dress.

		<shortDescription>better than 'Frozen', but sort of similar...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I didn't love the original 'Snow White and Huntsman' and this one is slightly better in some ways and worse in others.Like the first- cast, action and effects are good, but the story is lacking and it suffers from the current Hollywood mality of trying to make everyone a hero, even the villains, (Fast and Furious 7 is now up to 7 good guys, against 1 bad guy?) Also leaving Snow White out of her own franchise, and sort of making it a prequel/sequel doesn't really work.The two sisters, one basically 'Iceman from X-Men' seemed too similar and too soon to 'Frozen' but it was better than 'Frozen' (don't get me started on that piece of @#$%), but sort of similar in a lot of ways.Hemsworth is such a likable, great screen presence but is sort of wasted, I'd just rather see him in a better movie than trying to turn this into a franchise.The same goes for Blunt and Theron, they are both such great actors, they sort of seem 'better' than this movie to be throwing around special effects and wearing princess costumes.It is by no means a bad movie, I watched the original a second time just before watching this, but any of the current superhero movies leave this one for dust in the laughs, action and character departments.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie starts out really well. Given the amount of raw talent in the film, it would be really hard for it to not have any redeeming qualities. Emily Blunt! Furiosa! Thor! JessChastain! Wow! So, as expected, we see the beginning of how the two evil queens become evil. The plot has depth and is very promising at this point. Then comes the "Quest". Every fairytale has this legendary quest that the hero/ heroine must undertake for the sake of everything good. This part of he film was also okay. Towards the end though, the plot was falling apart and wandering into very very predictable, mundane, and boring territory. The promises of epic fights and wars that never happen litter the entire film. Needless to say, this is a bit disappointing, considering that our star cast would be brilliantly suited for aforementioned wars.Ultimately, the end comes without fanfare. :/ This is still a decent watch, but it could have been so much more!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Couldn't understand a thing Chris Hemsworth said through his terribly muddled Scottish Jeff Bridges accent, and it seemed to be contagious as it spread to all the cast past the half way point. Needed to turn on subtitles to be able to follow the story.Also, not that special effects necessarily make a good movie, but this one was lacking in the department.I appreciate trying to put a new spin on a classic, but the budget spent on cast set a disappointing bar for how good the movie was going to be. If you were led to this film by searching through any specific cast member's filmography, you can probably skip this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Inconsistency &amp; Love Story Foils The Wicked Brilliance of "The Huntsman: Winter's War"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Movie trailers can be tantalizing little critters. They, the deceptive ones, always lure you in with the juicy and exciting pieces of the film and then crush your expectations when you view the one and a half hour glib movie that they pushed as an entertaining "masterpiece." "The Huntsman: Winter's War" trailer did exactly that, it bamboozled moviegoers with stunning visual effects and a snippet of Charlize Theron's and Emily Blunt's sinister behavior toward one another. I say to you right now, if you, like me, found the trailer to be interesting, but have not seen the film, please don't waste your hard earned money on it. No lie. Don't. Don't waste your money.The premise of "The Huntsman: Winter's War" is based on revenge. The story takes place prior or after the previous "Snow White and The Huntsman." If you are wondering why I can't decide if "The Huntsman: Winter's War" is after or before its predecessor, it's because it was never quite made clear. According to the narrator of the film, the story of Winter's War was back story. A "Let me tell you what happened prior to Ravenna (evil sorceress, played by Charlize Theron), dying at the hands of Snow White." This left me confused throughout the movie, because Ravenna fools her poor sister Freya, played by Emily Blunt, into becoming a cold, no pun intended, and heartless woman thus giving her the moniker Ice Queen, and that Ice Queen exacts rule over the land during Snow White's reign.Flashback to "Snow White and the Huntsman," Kristen Stewart plays the role of Snow White, and Chris Hemsworth plays the role of the Huntsman. His service is summoned by Ravenna to capture Snow White and bring her back to him. She offers to bring his dead wife back in return if he completes her task. Screeechhhh!!! Pump the brakes!! Do you see where the twisted and nonsensical storyline comes into play? How is it that the Huntsman had a deceased wife in "Snow White and the Huntsman," but in "The Huntsman: Winter's War," the Huntsman meets his wife before and during Snow White's reign, and his wife does not die while Ravenna is alive? I'm not astrophysicist smart, but I do have a decent amount of intelligence. Therefore, that, the above question that I asked, cannot make sense, and does not make sense. This is what viewers will have to reconcile in their brains while watching the film.The Huntsman, Chris Hemsworth, did not know Snow White in the first film; moreover, Snow White was young when he met her. So, how could she have been in power in his past? Two, I'm going to stop. I was going to make another statement, but I'm about to confuse myself even more than what I was a few minutes ago.I'll move on to the performances. The highlights of the film were the masterful performances of Charlize Theron and Emily Blunt. They were fierce and wicked. The shame of it was that the audience never got to see the two pitted against one another until the last thirty minutes of the film. Instead, the audience was treated to a love story between the Huntsman, Chris Hemsworth and the girlfriend, Jessica Chastain. What a bore of a relationship and what a total waste of movie time. Their performances were wooden and their chemistry seemed forced. Plus, I'll add this in to the mix, Chris Hemsworth and Jessica Chastain are supposed to play roles as Freya, the Ice Queen, played by Emily Blunt's "children." Imagine the faces of Chris Hemsworth and Jessica Chastain and Emily Blunt. Now, does Chris Hemsworth and Jessica Chastain look younger than Emily Blunt? No. Not even a smidgen. Argh!! That's what happens when you want to do a sequel in reverse order. Characters age! I needn't go into more. "The Huntsman: Winter's War" is a turn-off and a sad case of fairy tale telling at its worst. Everything doesn't need to be made into a movie nor does it always need a sequel. This franchise should have stopped at "Snow White and the Huntsman."</fullReview>

Great fantasy/fairy tale film with all the goblins, fairies and mythical beasts. Reminded me of another poorly reviewed film "Willow" which I also enjoyed. Willow was made before special effects were very sophisticated so the monster looked a little early Godzilla but I again thought it was entertaining and took you to a wonderful fantastic realm. I don't know what is not to like about this film if you went to see a fairy tale. Emily Blunt, Charlize Theron and Chris Hemsworth did a fine job with their characters. The comic relief with the dwarfs was hilarious.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Walking out of the cinema with the temptation to write something cynical:</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(This review has been edited down to meet IMDBs guidelines, full review here: https://www.facebook.com/andreas.feix.3/posts/1164332853586155 )So, I just saw ?The Huntsman: Winter's War", and to sum up the experience... it felt like a badly mixed drink. Surely you can mix together some maple syrup, a bit of iced tea, a slice of golden apple juice &amp; a handful of Smarties and water everything down in the end, and some actually consider it tasty, but don't let it stand in the sun for too long afterwards or it all ends up becoming a bit stale.[...]First of all there are a few positives to note, even though not enough as for me to stand up clapping with wild foam in my mouth: Everybody doing who was doing practical work in this film did a good job, indeed. The costumes were fine and I didn't assume once, while watching, that they were just waiting in line to start their next LARP session, but halfway through the film, the choice of clothing ended up reminding me of the selectable options in an RPG - [...]The effects work was alright, but any more words out of my mouth might sound hypocritical in either direction, so I'll just shut up. The camera-work, editing and the direction was all pretty much decent and expected for this type of movie, no complaint there, and props to the director who, as this turns out to be his debut, didn't turn this into a personal experimental type of Swiss cheese, and stuck to what is well known and safe, and in return doing a good job. [...] And this is the point where I slowly started to sink back into my seat in a mixture of rolling my eyes and fumes of entertainment being slowly dragged down by boredom-oxide: Turns out that Miss Evil Queen Theron has a sister ? while her brother is nowhere to be found, probably because his haircut took a little bit to long this time. Anyway, Sister Elsa has a child that dies, and Miss Evil had absolutely nothing do with it... nothing at all, trust me...nothing... Her reaction is a bit frosty ? Miss-Evil-Queen-Theron-had-nothing-to-with-it ? so she heads towards the Arctic circle, builds the world's largest Popsicle in Valhalla, and vows to turn every boy into Thor &amp; every girl into Matthew McConaughy's daughter. [...]Turns out that two of them start falling in love ? what a shock, given the variables ? but since she can't have any for herself, she starts acting like the playground bully and separates them using Donald Trump's wet dream of a Mexican border On Ice. Years later, she decides it's now her turn to have her sister's mirror, because apparently she wasn't good at sharing, but turns out that the actual Thor and 1/7th of the original dwarfs stretched into two might stand in her way; and that's about all I can say without spoiling the ending where Miss Evil Queen Theron returns. Interestingly she's only there to bookend the film which apparently earns her higher credit billing than all the actors, and despite the fact that the ?and"-credit at the end of the list sometimes feels like the prestigious prelude to the Special Guest Famous Actor Awards, it doesn't explain how the the puppy-eyed (now) king from the first movie receives a higher screen credit than the protagonist's love interest, despite the fact that percentage-wise his screen time compared to her is like a few seeds to two melons. Somewhere in here, there are actually some very nice ingredients hidden, but it doesn't help that it's all cooked up using the standard formula. Pretty much everything is told by the book ? oh I'm sorry, did I say book? I rather meant those cardboard paperweights from Fisher Price teaching kids how to spell. And it doesn't help that every single plot twist or development is telegraphed from miles away. Sorry, but that's the same reason why dangerous roads end up being boring ? how are you supposed to get only a little bit of adrenaline pumping with all those road signs warning in advance? At points you almost start hopping in your seat as you wait for characters to come to the same conclusion as the audience did 30 to 90 minutes ago. [...]And don't get me started on the romance- oh wait, I already did: You start with one man and two male dwarfs, who are at some point saved by his former love, and she states over and over she doesn't love him, after which they all get captured by two female dwarfs who don't like anything with a pair either. I swear I could almost hear some executive looking down at the audience and whispering: ?Don't worry, we just start with the spelling book, let's see how long it takes until they figured out basic math." And then, there be monkeys; tainted, naked monkeys with horns on their heads who like to cover themselves in wealthy objects and might start a flame war if you hit on them inappropriately. Do I smell a little bit of a self-referential cameo, in there, anyone, tee-he? I will give the movie this, though: While I was busy thinking that I had already uncovered the next plot twist halfway through, it instead revealed that it had a different twist up its sleeve; equally lazy and predictable, but nevertheless it caught me off- guard. Okay, good job movie, you fooled me once, you can be proud of yourself for that. [...]Everything ends happily every after, leaving me pondering if fairy tales were actually a little more exploitive in their tropes, right before the court swings over in favor for films with a nibble of sequel-baiting for dessert.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Weak Narrative Makes Huntsman' an Unnecessary Pre/Sequel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Even with its imposing technical flair, 'The Huntsman: Winter's War' can only do so much to hide every hole in its already tired narrative. What it can do best seems utterly insufficient to compensate for what it is screamingly lacking. Now moving on without the once titular "Snow White", 'Huntsman' serves both as a prequel and a sequel to the Kristen Stewart-starred film. While her absence may not have made any significant difference, it is inevitable to think about how better ?or more likely, worse?it might have become if the film continued her tale. Be that as it may, the idea of having 'The Huntsman' as the main object of the narrative is interesting enough to spark attention. The spotlight is on Eric (Chris Hemsworth)?our titular 'Huntsman?at the start of the film where it recounts his beginning. He was a young soldier enlisted to serve for the Ice Queen, Freya (Emily), who was embittered by the demise of her child and her lover's betrayal. Enraged with hate, the once good-hearted ruler, abducts young children to build an army, disabling them to have the capacity to love? at least that's what she wants to believe. But love is powerful?yeah, as cliché as it may sound?and so Eric finds the love of his life, in Jessica Chastain's Sara, a fellow warrior, with whom he is specifically forbidden to fall in love. The Ice Queen, as expected, discovers the affair, and sends him to exile.Jumping to seven years after Snow White's triumph against the Wicked Queen, Ravenna (Charlize Theron), the narrative shifts its focus to what may seem the main concern of the story: the quest for the missing magical mirror. Reunited, Eric and Sara, embarks on a quest to recover it before Freya does. Their adventure eventually leads to the return of villainous Ravenna, whose connivance with her equally wicked ice-controlling sister, ensues a much more miserable struggle for the reunited pair, who for most of their shared moments, are just trying to rekindle the flame that gave in to Freya's freezing power.The interesting subtexts dropped, and some palpable comic effort, are as futile as the film's ambitious visuals can be. There are some suggestions here which might have helped the overall script to gather attention, but these potentials turn out to be just wasted efforts. As useless as the film's attempt to cultivate those depths is, its seemingly lack of interest to grant the story some structure, can only make the entirety even worse. In the wake of these fatal flaws, 'Huntsman' loses whatever 'fairness' the first film suggested to be having.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Huntsman: Winter's WarThe difference between huntsmen and poachers means absolutely nothing to a trophy class mule deer. The seeker in this fantasy-adventure, however, is stalking his long thought dead wife.Trained by ice queen Freya (Emily Blunt) to be a huntsman in her army, Eric (Chris Hemsworth) knows well her aversion to love so he keeps his marriage to fellow hunter Sara (Jessica Chastain) a secret.But when Freya learns of this adoration, the couple is dispersed and convinced each other is dead. Years hence, when Queen Snow White falls ill, the lovers are reunited. But this time as rivals. The unwarranted sequel to Snow White and the Huntsman, Winter's War is also a pointless prequel that does little to improve upon its predecessor's discourteous depiction of dwarfs. Moreover, its grandiose effects aren't enough to sustain its plodding plot.Incidentally, Snow White's sobriquet would imply that her ailment is likely an overdose.

		<fullReview>So they had the budget, the ability to make some good CGI with choreography. And yet they decided to make a movie such as this with the resources they had. I mean "Snow White and the Huntsman" wasn't even that big of a hit and is easily forgettable. It wasn't like the viewers really wanted a prequel or a sequel. Despite the CGI and the action choreography which is well done. This is very boring and non- engaging movie. The narrative of this flick is very weak and it seems like something a 12 year old could have wrote up. So the direction is very subpar because the narrative is so simple and bland and yet have bunch of things happening on screen. And it's all so boring and corny. Even the dialogue is not only very generic and forgettable, it sometimes comes across as annoying sometimes. You know those movies where you know what is going on but the characters don't and it helps build tension or excitement. Well this has the opposite effect of that. The title has Winter's War in it and yet there is no actual war in it. After the super success of "Frozen" it seems like the director tried to take emulate it, in a live action fairy tale and failed. Overall, this is a movie even the kids might get bored with. I give it a 4.3 because I have seen worse.4.3/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm gonna say I no way thought Snow White and The Huntsman(2012) was a great film, but an entertaining film. I wish I can say the same about this prequel/sequel, but I can't quite. Kristen Stewart does not reprise her role, so that is why there is no Snow White in the title. The film borrows some elements from Brave(2012) and Frozen(2013).The trailer was quite misleading, I thought I was gonna get a prequel to the 2012 film, well I got that through the first part, and then it becomes a sequel. Action where pretty descent, so where the effects. But the acting is far from amusing, Chris Hemsworth reprising his role, plays it like he was filming Avengers:Age of Ultron back to back, and could not break from the character of Thor, he really hams it up. Emily Blunt comes across not knowing how to play her character, she is really bland and uninteresting. Jessica Chastain really sleep walks through her role, looks like she'd rather be something else. Both Blunt and Chastain are great actress's, and if they switched roles, I probably would have liked it more. There some dwarfs in this, they are funny but that's it, there is no real reason for them to be there, in the first film there was a reason, here there is a little reason, but other than that they are there to be the comedic relief.All in all, not great, but not all terrible. But could have been done better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was boring and confusing. I mean the story line was confusing. Did it happen before or after Snow White and Huntsman? I agree 100% with some others who gave the movie low rating. The directing, script and acting was all very mediocre. The only thing that captured my attention was Ms Therons shiny golden costume. It was really impressive and I would by one for myself if available. As for the rest, it was a spin-off of Snow Whites story but Snow White herself was nowhere to be seen. Both me and my husband kept asking throughout the story: where is Snow White? We want Snow White not this bland huntsman and his equally boring girlfriend. It was so far out from the original fairy tale that it rose the question why did they not come up with a completely new story line? The only thing connecting two stories was the Mirror on the Wall that they kept dragging around (and if you asked me, it rather reminded of a giant frying pan). The most ridiculous thing in this movie was the King-Kong type characters with horns. I mean they jumped around on the trees like gorillas but had heads of a Minotaur or something. The animation looked as it it was done in the middle of past century, sometime when the first King Kong movie came out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nothing Original here, move on</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I enjoy movies and rarely walk out of them, but I did on this one and for the simple reason that nothing new has been done here. The CGI is gorgeous and everything else is meh. I realized my wife and I were watching a small repeat of LORD OF THE RINGS and HOBBIT with FROZEN thrown in for good measure. It also was not a film I could love, or felt had real heart. Another bad sign was narration throughout the first 30 min of the film. Narration per se is best used for opening sequences and then dispensed with. The plot should carry it's own weight, but not here so that was a big minus. Chris Helmsworth is fun, that's about all. So while I cannot comment on the film beyond the first hour, it was a waste of money in my opinion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As visually sumptuous as it is, this prequel-slash-sequel is no more than a half-baked mishmash of vastly superior fairy-tales/ fantasy adventuresis</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Neither Snow White nor Kristen Stewart from the earlier 'Snow White and the Huntsman' return for this follow-up, though it is anyone's guess whether their exclusion is due to the actress being too expensive for this decidedly lower-budget instalment or because of her relationship-ending fling with the first film's married director Rupert Sanders. In her character's place, it is perhaps only natural and inevitable that Chris Hemsworth's axe-wielding hero Eric would be elevated to lead status, in order to form the narrative glue between the events of that 2012 original and this latest ? and if you're wondering about Charlize Theron's evil queen Ravenna, let's just say that she plays at best a supporting role that is much less significant than the promotional materials have made her out to be.Rather than choose between a prequel and a sequel, French director Cedric Nicolas-Troyan and his writers Evan Spiliotopoulos and Craig Mazin have decided to make their live-action fairytale a bit of both, resulting in a time jump that will leave those unfamiliar with the earlier film more than a little confused. With no small measure of help from narrator Liam Neeson, we are introduced to Ravenna's younger sister Freya (Emily Blunt), a romantic-at-heart who turns into a bitter icy-hearted villainess following the death of her child at the presumed hands of her lover cum daughter's father. It is perhaps no coincidence given 'Frozen's' box-office success that Freya develops icy-related powers in her post-traumatic process, transforming into the Ice Queen who goes about establishing her kingdom of ruthless killers by kidnapping kids and training them to be warriors she calls huntsmen.Two of her best warriors happen to be Eric (played in his teenage years by Conrad Khan) and the flame-haired Sara (Niamh Walter; then Jessica Chastain), who defy Freya's commandment not to love by doing just that with each other. When she finds out that Eric and Sara have secretly gotten married and intend to leave her kingdom, Freya separates them with a wall of enchanted ice that leaves Eric thinking that Sara has been killed by a fellow huntsman and Sara thinking that Eric has left her there to die. The plot then fast- forwards seven years to after Snow White's defeat of Ravenna in part one, where Sam Claflin's handsome prince makes a brief return to implore Eric to track down and destroy Ravenna's magic golden mirror that has gone missing but continues to exert its evil influence over Snow White.That mission is of course but excuse for Eric to be reunited with his thought-to-be-dead wife Sara and team up to end Freya's icy dominion once and for all ? but not without vanquishing her 'cannot- seem-to-stay-dead' sister Ravenna at the same time. Since Eric and Sara are not quite people of good humour, their journey gets some welcome comic relief in the form of two male dwarfs Nion (Nick Frost) and Gryff (Rob Brydon) as well as their romantic interests of the opposite sex Mrs. Bromwyn (Sheridan Smith) and Doreena (Alexandra Roach). As distracting as their snappy salty banter may be, their presence is easily the best thing that the film has going for it, not only because of their easy chemistry but also because they get the scant memorable lines from an otherwise clunky and leaden script.As sympathetic as we want to be to the writers for having to keep Snow White out of the picture, the seven-year leap around the events of the original does their film absolutely no favours. What transpired between Ravenna and Freya in those seven years, or Sara for that matter, is probably the most glaring logic gap, not to mention why Freya would suddenly decide upon her sister's death that she should acquire the magic mirror for herself. It also begs the question why Freya never sought to doubt Ravenna's hand in orchestrating the death of her daughter in the years since the former left to create her own fiefdom, and only decides to do so when the latter is somehow magically resurrected by the mirror.Nicolas-Troyan's experience in the visual effects department (as opposed to the storytelling department) also means that his priority is to deliver spectacle, and true enough, the wintry vistas as well as the CGI-ed sorcery looks sumptuous. There are Colleen Atwood's lavish costumes to feast on as well, the veteran designer on many a Tim Burton film going all out to make Freya look coolly stunning and Ravenna wickedly ravishing. Yet all that style cannot quite distract from a distinct lack of substance, which borrows liberally from a certain Disney animated hit with that song 'Let It Go', 'The Lord of the Rings', 'Game of Thrones' and even 'The Hunger Games'. Oh yes, you'll be hard-pressed to find a shred of originality in this half- baked mish-mash of a product which makes no apologies for taking ingredients from other vastly superior fairy-tales and/ or fantasy adventures.If that sounds like we're bashing up 'The Huntsman: Winter's War', that's largely because it is quite embarrassingly devoid of imagination, inspiration or excitement ? and no minotaur-like monster or elfin wood nymph changes that. That's not to say that it isn't watchable, especially if all you're looking for is some diverting fairy-tale entertainment; but when you have actors off the quality of Chastain, Theron and Blunt, you'd probably expect much, much more than a throwaway popcorn flick that squanders them in such shallow caricatured roles. Hemsworth might be one of the hottest male actors today, but even his fit, rugged presence cannot quite save you from this cold.</fullReview>

But not enough to take anything from the story line. The beautiful Charlize Theron is back again as the evil Ravena creating trouble for all. Emily Blunt is fantastic as her bitterly warped sister Freya and the lovely Jessica Chastain steals all hearts in her role as the huntsman's lover - Sarah. Costumes and set design are brilliant and it is beautifully shot. My personal gripe was I wanted to see more of Snow White who does not appear at all. But on the whole a great piece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The female characters overshadow the Huntsman</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The acting from Charlise Theron, Emily Blunt &amp; Jessica Chastain was quite good, but it stops there. Since the The Huntsman is in the title, I don't think there was enough care made to make the central character more memorable. Unlike the characters of Raveena &amp; Freya whose story lines &amp; dazzling special effects dominated the film. Their costumes were gorgeous too.Chris Hemsworth came off as a bit of a ham, for me, rather than a hero. Yes, he is eye candy, and can be forgiven to an extent because he did not write the lines. However his appalling accent was more laughable than his attempts at comedic timing. His sidekicks managed more successfully to amuse.The visual effects in this movie will save it from totally tanking. Most of them were truly awesome, notably for Ravenna &amp; Freya. Others were a bit cartoonish, such as the horned goblins and the fairies. I also found some of the fighting sequences disjointed and so obviously CGI that they were distracting rather than visually exciting, as intended.Aside from great visuals, this movie is a hodgepodge of ideas borrowed from other fantasy films and TV series, nothing new.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>They got Liam Neeson to narrate this? The Huntsman: Winters War has a terrific cast and loads of talent in the special effects department, but I have yet to be wowed by anything either film in the franchise has showed me. Much like its predecessor, an unnecessarily muddled plot and uneven direction proves to outweigh the good that comes from this fantasy adventure.This film managed to climb its way onto number 14 on my most anticipated list for 2016 as I was not only thrilled to see Emily Blunt in a lead villain role, but I also thought the trailer made the film look pretty cool. Plus, when you bring in Jessica Chastain and bring back Chris Hemsworth and Charlize Theron, I think that's a reason to at least be looking forward to seeing the finished product. This time around, I didn't so much have a problem with the performances of the leads, as I did have an issue with the lack of real invention or anything noteworthy. With the exception of one plot point, everything is painfully predictable.Theron, in her limited role, is once again fantastic and steals each scene from Blunt. I love Blunt as much as the next guy, but I found her performance to be pretty bland. Chastain had some nice action moments and the most clear arc out of any of the characters, but I wasn't fond of her accent. Trust me, there was a good story here with plenty of talent in front of the camera, but the direction killed any chance of that. It's a shame.It's both a prequel and sequel for Chris Hemsworth's Huntsman character. If they somehow make another one, I'll be there, because there is a certain amount of entertainment found here with a few action scenes here or there, some added humor, cool costume designs, and gorgeous visuals. But they have to make the audience care about its characters. That comes from the directing and writing, sadly, neither decided to show up for this film.+Visuals+Theron is a scene stealer+Added action-Muddled plot-Who is this film targeting?-Wastes the acting talent on screen5.9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A decent refinement in action and visual, but at the core it's a predictably sappy fantasy drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first Huntsman adventure with Snow White was a bit of a mess, the chaotic attempt for dark tone and bizarre plot development hampered the movie. "The Huntsman: Winter's War" has a bit of improvement here and there while keeping the magical vibe going with good cast. However, the plot always reverts back to cheesy romance theme and typical adventure antics.The movie is not without its perks, both Emily Blunt and Charlize Theron perform nicely. Chris Hemsworth retains his rugged charm and pretty much set for the journey as the leading man. Charlize Theron as Ravenna is cold and relentless, she looks unsurprisingly imposing. Emily Blunt as Freya is the new ice queen, although it's a bit of the usual vengeful queen, she gives a valiant effort on a couple of her emotional scenes.What bogs down the movie is over-saturated romantic plot, one might say it takes the center story as other kingdom crisis take secondary roles. This might be fine if it doesn't spam "love conquers all" catchphrase every step of the way. Everyone is either struck or abandoned by Cupid, and the entourage of adventurers is not as entertaining as they aspire to be.Graphic is pretty stellar, at least in the design department. The playful trick with black and golden aura looks good in contrast with the newly winter theme. The CG is inconsistent at times, portraying mythical beast in rather clumsy manner. Still, the fight choreography is pretty engaging, it still has shaky cam but there's more to scuffle than random bashing, which is finely appreciated.Production for Winter War is adequate, sadly it simply rehearses the typical adventure drama and comedy. The end result is fairly presentable, but certainly could've been more charming.</fullReview>

Chastain Scottish accent is so awful and so distracting that I'm surprise not a lot of people have bought this up. Emily Blunt dose what I call "The Eddie Ascending performance" where she talks really quite at the first and then out of nowhere just explode with rage.Chris Hemsworth and Charlize Theron are also in this movie...and both are given nothing to do.Overall: "The Huntsman Winter's War" is a joyless, empty, and a very dull flick that takes away the magic from a fairy tale.I know this may not be a long detail review, but just like what Mike Stoklasa (RedLetterMedia) once said "Who gives a f**k."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ravenna(Theron, seductive and deadly) had a sister. And uh, never a brother. Retcon away! Freya(Blunt, measured, cold) realized her powers when her infant daughter was murdered. She raised an army. Of... Huntsmen. Look, we could only get one major character back, we had to justify his importance. She conquered many lands. Now, she seeks the magic mirror. It wasn't destroyed, for... reasons. Eric(Hemsworth, charming as ever) and a few buddies have to find it and keep her from retrieving it. But suddenly he sees Sara(Chastain, spot-on), the wife he thought dead...This is very much a sequel. It tries to go bigger, albeit it's not eager to show even a single army much less ones fighting each other and the climax is small. The structure is similar to that of the first, and rather than particularly expanding the world, it tries to just fit itself into it. It's much more crowd-pleasing. About a third of the comedy doesn't work, the rest is fine but does serve to render this less disturbing albeit still dark. The action is great and plentiful.There is some crass content in this. I recommend this only to those who want something light that is connected to the original film. 5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fails to improve on its ordinary predecessor.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wasn't a huge fan of Snow White and the Huntsman, but it had enough moments of entertainment that I was mildly excited when the trailer for this subsequent effort popped up on my radar. Nothing like a second chance to fix your mistakes. Yet for all the things it improves on there are just as many areas it takes a backwards step in, placing it roughly on par with its predecessor, meaning Universal Pictures has floundered twice with this live action franchise. A hurdle the screenwriters ultimately couldn't overcome was delivering a Snow White follow-up without, erm, Snow White ? Kristen Stewart being written out of the movie as punishment for her transgressions during the filming of the original ? resulting in a clunky sprequel (sequel and prequel for those playing at home) with glaring plot contrivances. The narrative awkwardness also messes with the movie's tempo, however the filmmakers wisely restrain the runtime to under two hours and ensure that it's largely spent sword fighting, axe swinging and arrow shooting, albeit without creating any memorable set pieces. Debutant director Cedric Nicolas-Troyan continues the unique visual design established in the preceding movie (not surprising considering his VX background), swirling fantasy elements into the medieval environment with the assistance of top notch CGI. The real drawcard here is the cast, with both Chris Hemsworth and Charlize Theron returning as the hunky-brooding-charming eponymous hero and the sneering-sadistic-venomous Queen Ravenna respectively, the latter especially appearing to be having an absolute ball. New to the series are Emily Blunt as the ice-cold villain who instigates the titular battle and Jessica Chastain as a badass warrior with a complex romantic entanglement with Hemsworth's Huntsman; both of these supremely talented actresses do what they can to bring some dramatic heft to proceedings. It's a damn shame the screenplay has so many shortcomings and the action sequences fail to elevate above being merely serviceable, as Winter's War, bolstered by a cast to die for, could've been a rip-roaring franchise lifter.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Though a big produces Hollywood movie is never "bad", "The Huntsman &amp; the Ice Queen" turned out to be nothing more than easy entertainment. Many professionals with great CGI-skills put an effort into this movie, making it somewhat worth your time. But a bunch of A-class actors and a lot of money is not what makes an outstanding movie. The story line is in parts weak. You get confused easily, especially if you haven't seen the first one. In my perspective the trailer turned out to be slightly misleading in aspects like screen time of certain actors and the overall depth of the characters.It has never been a secret that the motivation behind the movie was not the story but simple moneymaking. I just didn't think it would turn out to be that obvious while watching the film. For example: I was excited for the costumes of the "queens" because this particular aspect was especially breathtaking in the first movie. They were of course beautiful but you couldn't really appreciate them. The movie focused more on quantity than on quality. Changing the villains outfits in nearly every scene, not giving its audience the chance to truly appreciate the aesthetics.All in all the viewers were bombarded with pretty faces, detailed garments and nice scenery, which only managed in parts to overshadow the lack of authentic story making.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Serving as a prequel to 2012's 'Snow White and the Huntsmen', The Huntsmen: Winters War offers more of the same: poorly written characters, bland storyline, and complete overuse of special effects and action. It is every bit as dreary and humorless as the first film, with little humour and overly dark tones, despite being marketed toward a younger audience.Drowned in a dull melange of CGI fueled violence and poor dialogue, The Huntsmen: Winters War is just as colorless and disinteresting as what came before it. However, the likes of Emily Blunt and Jessica Chastain are far superior to the emotionless statue that is Kristen Stewart and do add to the thematic pull of the films characters - but this does not make for a better movie.The cast aren't an issue at all - it is studded with very capable and very talented actors, but they are given little to work with and some of the delivery of lines is nothing short of horrible. It is fair to say that most of the cast are reasonably competent in their roles despite a weak script and undeniable acting talent.The films main saving grace are its action sequences - whilst there are far too many of them, they are reasonably entertaining and well executed - but the act wears thin after a while. Overuse of CGI is becoming more of a problem in todays day and age, and this film suffers desperately from complete overabundance of special effects and CGI - and it seriously detracts from the film. Action and special effects have a time and a place - and sometimes are used brilliantly - and at other times are clearly shoehorned in to illicit 'wows' from the audience - but it fails miserably in doing so. Marred by a poor script, vague plot, and an onslaught of special effects driven action, The Huntsmen: Winter's War is as wholly forgettable and just as unnecessary as its predecessor.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cynics beware! This movie is not meant to be taken seriously!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really wanted to hate THE HUNTSMAN: WINTERS WAR. On the surface, all the elements of any bad fantasy movies come into play with such potency that saying "this movie is not good" would be an understatement. The acting ranges from bland to phony, the CGI is overused and unimpressive, there is virtually no plot other than haphazard check listing of random events, the tone jumbles between self-serious to cheesy camp too frequently, and it is overall little more than mimicking the flashy aestheticism of the epic, sweeping fantasy genre. But? I still enjoyed it. Big, anchoring problems aside, there is a level of self-aware charm that blooms within the films absurdity that it almost goes out of its way to punish those who take it seriously. It's yet another stupid, poorly constructed LORD OF THE RINGS clone, but I simply cannot deny how much fun both I and the filmmakers are having overall. Acting as both a prequel and a sequel to the first movie (yes, that again) WINTERS WAR apes the same carbon-copy fantasy style from the first movie on a different telling on the more recent Disney tales of FROZEN and BRAVE, in which the Ice Queen (Emily Blunt) acts as a sister of Charlize Theoren's character from the first movie and accidentally exposes her ice powers after realizing that her child has been murdered by, supposedly, her illicit husband. This scars her for the rest of her life as she builds and rules her own kingdom run by Huntsmen under the law that "love is forbidden". But, big shock, a couple falls in love (Thor from the first movie and Jessica Chastain trying to sound and look like Merida) so the Queen banishes them with an unexplained and just ultimately forgotten mind-bending powers. Fast forward to after the first movie, Thor and 2/7 of the dwarfs come back to wander around for a few minutes until they run into Merida, who has info that the mirror is being pursuit by Elsa and the Huntsman, but is also mad at Thor for apparently leaving her. So they quarrel each while finding the mirror for another few minutes until they run into the queen and BLAH BLAH BLAH I don't even care anymore, and quite frankly neither does the movie. Apart of basically forgetting that the first movie ever happened other than the mirror coming back (thank god, because so did I), the movie basically does little to develop a coherent plot other than randomly-linked events. First Thor goes to a random pub, then he meets Merida, then she tells him that they need to find the mirror for some reason, then the Queen finds them and captures Merida, and then Thor and his buddies plot an invasion of the queen's fortress to fight the queen. There is no glue holding it together and that is to say nothing how sloppy and dumb the rest of the writing is. The film poorly attempts to acknowledge certain story clichés (who saves who, the aspect of true love, etc.) but instead of transcending away from said clichés like other better stories, it just?does them. It does not even explain character actions, the rules of the universe or anything worth a damn. However, as stated before, the movie discriminates those who give it more thought that it deserves and just botches all sorts of logic and reason just because. At one point where Thor attempts his totally implausible invasion plan, he trips on the roof and falls flat on his face and saying "this is the worst plan ever" and it is there that sums up the whole movie: "We don't even care anymore, but aren't these actors having fun despite that?" Granted, the actors are having a blast playing their one-note characters. Chris Hemsworth finally gains some levity among the otherwise handsome brute from the last movie. Chastain does a TERRIBLE Scottish accent, but she still has fun as the bow-and-arrow heroine spewing on-the-nose dialogue. Nick Frost and Rob Brydon are fun as the dwarfs, who have been stripped down to little more than comic relief. And, of course, the two main female antagonists easily steal the show as their conflicts between each other instantly caught my attention. Apparently Theron scorns Elsa (yeah I know she has another name, but it would be pointless NOT to call her Elsa) for being too weak to inherent the throne of a lifelong dynasty of evil rulers and goes out of her way to ruin her life just to toughen her up a bit. This comes as close to the film actually having some substance as it possibly can, and by the point the frankly underwhelming boss fight climax passed, I was still satisfied with how it concluded. Doubly so considering that Emily Blunt is literally the last person to be cast as a villain the same caliber as Theron. Don't get me wrong; she is more than capable in other, better roles, but she has limited charisma to be the over-the-top Rita Repulsa character. But the movies "genius" is having that limitation be the actual dilemma of her character, overshadowed by her better, more evil sister. Had this been a whole different story, the movie would've had even less going for it than what already is. So in conclusion, no it is not good. But in a strange way, it is almost a thrill to watch, mostly due to the filmmakers flopping in their efforts and just have fun for a change. This will likely be overrated by the new generation as this weird, campy relic from the past with the same appreciation as LABYRINTH or WILLOW. In either case, go watch and see for yourselves.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mirror, mirror, on the wall, who has been guilty of this defeat?This "The Huntsman: Winter's War" Review contains some spoilers. If you have not seen "The Huntsman: Winter's War" film, please, do not read, this could destroy it.Four years ago, "Snow White and the Huntsman" generated reviews positive and hopes in probable projects with the tint and tone of this, by modifying the Disney classic by a story filled with darkness, blood and fantasy. "The Huntsman: Winter's War" was released on April 22 as a prequel partial, partial sequel or spin- off of the film 2012. "Before Snow White story" is the label given to begin the story. Keeping in mind references to Harry Potter, the film has forgotten a requirement essential for this type of tales, its length. Understandable is that the audience would not accept a duration three hours or a sequel more, then they had to resort to form the foundations of the story and the origin of their characters in a way short, synthetic and truthful, trick failed since the film feels loose. Well evidenced by the "Harry Potter" or "Lord of the Rings", to do quality things you need time. Around 114 minutes the movie feels dull and incomplete, only lit by the few memorable action scenes, the emergence of Charlize Theron, Jessica Chastain and Emily Blunt and its extravagant and unique costumes and scenery.Just like a grotesque dwarf, there is something cute and good inside. Many necessary elements are present but are not sufficiently enlightened enough to be seen with the greatness that should be. Well-established scenes and subtle choreographies are not projected so majestic and cautious because of the consequences of the lack of time, hurry and anxiety of capturing everything regarding to story does not achieve to be exciting and much less interesting. I think one of the major problems of the sequel was, not add in cameo manner or a secondary role to the soul of the story "Kristen Stewart" (Snow White in "Snow White and the Huntsman"), omitting the small flashback in the film.The first part is to propose and introduce the origins of the ancient (or new, in this context) characters and introduce the new faces of the acclaimed fairy tale. Opening scenes focus in the Queen Revenna (Charlize Theron) narrating how she killed her husband to steal his throne, and then, for reasons revealed in the end, Revenna decides to break heart of her younger sister, Freya (Emily Blunt) the Ice Queen of the North. Also, they give us answers of how the hunter became in hunter and reveal to Sarah (Jessica Chastain) his love.The evil queen, Revenna takes the throne of the kingdom and attacks her sister, the story begins. Due to disorders and traumas, Freya decides to recruit children to train them and convert them in her warriors. Would give them food, lodging and training free with a single condition: in her kingdom, words love and family are gone. As pass the years, Sara and Eric create a relationship which finish in fatalism. Seven years later, Eric run into with Sara and decide to focus on a perilous adventure in order to find the legendary mirror and take revenge against Freya, discovering important secrets... Closing with the phrase "but not all fairy tales are perfect ",referring to the story of snow white.In addition to the imposing costumes, the most cool is its cast. Charlize Theron, Emily Blunt, and Jessica Chastain have accumulated 20 nominations (all together) at various prestigious film awards. Despite the memorable work done on this movie, I think that the list won't increase. Charlize Theron manages to provide an incredible interpretation, transmitting dread, loathing, and a bit of fear. In spite of she's the Queen of the ice, Emily Blunt shows much warmth and strength in her character, Jessica Chastain gives us entertainment. On the contrary, Hemsworth seems that it has stopped all his potential in "Thor". Maybe, it was the script, pressure, or something else, but when Chris outlined a line of dialogue I felt that was watching a Mexican soap opera with dictions taken from Shakespeare, likewise I valued the effort with his role, in addition he was the main actor!.As if it were an adaptation of a romantic novel, "Winter's War" wait to catch to the public youth, mostly women, who want to see a bad romantic movie. Unlike other films, this manages to convey some interest to see it, because it shows in its TV spots or trailers the most exciting of the film, good strategy. I think that a sequel was necessary but with a totally different way. "The Huntsman: Winter's War" is not a bad idea, bad is the way in which they decided to infuse it through a horrible script and an intermittent development. Clear example: not all the fairy tales end with a "perfect ending".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than expected</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Charlize Theron reprises her role as the sorceress Ravena and Chris Hemsworth returns as the eponymous huntsman in The Huntsman: Winter's War. This Snow White fairy tale sans Snow White who was played by the absent Kristen Stewart is both a prequel and a sequel to the fairytale telling a story that circles around the events of the first movie. I had strayed away from reading particulars of the reviews but I had saw that most of them were pretty bad. The biggest argument I can think was that this movie was unnecessary, but I kind of liked it.The movie begins with what I believe was Liam Neeson narrating as he relates the story of the Ice Queen, played by one of my favorite actresses Emily Blunt. Blunt is decent as the Ice Queen Freya but this is probably one of her worst performances in a long time. Still, she brings a gravitas to a film that desperately needs it. Freya is scorned in a pretty obviously plot twist and her older sister, the aforementioned Ravena, brings out the ice magic in her.

		<shortDescription>The Huntsman: Winters's War</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>4 years ago, the film Snow White and the Huntsman attempted to "re-imagine" the Snow White tale as a medieval adventure full of insipid action, generic monsters and special effects. And now, the film The Huntsman: Winter's War answers all the questions we had made to ourselves then: Why was Queen Ravenna so evil? And what was her relationship with her sister Freya (to whom we hadn't even met) like? Well, I don't anybody wondered those questions, but that didn't avoid the spending of some millions of dollars to answer them. And, in order to do that, it borrows elements from The Chronicles of Narnia, The Lord of the Rings and The Snow Queen, another fairytale written by Hans Christian Anderson (upon which Frozen was also based). Unfortunately, that collection of influences couldn't form an interesting story. The first half an hour of The Huntsman: Winter's War is meant as a prequel, depicting the origin of Ravenna, her sister Freya and Eric the Huntsman; then, we jump 7 years later in order to examine the consequences of Ravenna's defeat, with her magic mirror as the big mcguffin everybody wants to control, and in order to avoid that, Eric will have to create an alliance with various picturesque characters who will help him in different ways... or betray him when he expects it the least. As I previously said, a combination of Frozen, The Chronicles of Narnia and The Lord of the Rings, but without any emotional deepness or narrative consistency (or songs). Cedric Nicolas-Troyan's direction feels superficial and uncertain, with poorly choreographed action sequences and insipid scenes. On the positive side, the actors make a good work in their roles. Chris Hemsworth feels credible and enthusiastic as Eric, while Jessica Chastain brings conviction and intensity (despite having the worst written character of the film, Charlize Theron keeps displaying quite an energy as the villain and Emily Blunt makes a decent work as Freya. However, despite the performances, I didn't like The Huntsman: Winter's War, and I can't recommend it. And please, I now don't need another sequel with Pinocchio as an eco-terrorist destroying the harvester machines of some corporative king, or something like that. I hope this marks the extinction of "dark" fairy tales.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It has some qualities lacking in most modern movies. It has a coherent, if not very interesting, story. It improves as it goes along and carries out until the end. Even though 3 out of 4 main characters are unbelievably powerful women, since 2 of 3 are witches and 3. is not pushing it too far, it doesn't feel like a "feminism in your face" kind of movie.But, other than that, there's not much else. It's not fun, has but a few good laughs, no really interesting characters. Even the "queen bitch" line doesn't work.The first movie (Snow white) at least had Charlize Theron's wicked witch, which was interesting. Here, she just doesn't work. She tries too hard and doesn't even look so good. Jessica Chastain spent a lot of time in the gym for this movie, and I'm glad for her, but she, too, blends into the rather boring sense of it all.First part of the movie is actually boring. Then it gets better, but it's too little, too late. It all feels just a little forced, done for the buck (as in $) of it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not So Happy (Ever After)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(RATING: &#x2606;&#x2606;? out of 5) THIS FILM IS NOT RECOMMENDED. IN BRIEF: Sluggish and dull, the film is not the fairest of them all.GRADE: CSYNOPSIS: This prequel tells the story of the huntsman, minus Snow White, and his saga to find true love and live happily ever after. Well, it is a fairy tale. Kinda.JIM'S REVIEW: There is no happily ever after for the moviegoer who slogs through this prequel/sequel, The Huntsman: Winter's War. One waits eagerly again to witness Charlize Theron's bewitching performance as the evil queen, Ravenna, and the stand-out CGI that was the saving grace of the earlier film, but there is less of both in this reincarnation. At least, Colleen Atwood's spell-binding costumes still have a sense of wit and splendor and firmly holds one's interest.In this revisionist version, Snow White is a mere walk-on, (or should I say a cry-on). Seen from the back by an extra substituting for Kristin Stewart, who wisely lost her invitation to attend this bawl, our regal lady laments the possible loss of her queendom and her valued mentor of a mirror. This brings our title character (Chris Hemsworth) front and center. On his journey to retrieve the mirror and fight the evil forces that dare to invade her land, we get the back-story of his life. Abducted as a child by Ravanna's sister, the Ice Queen (Emily Blunt), and forced to fight in her army, the huntsman falls in love with an Irish lass (Jessica Chastain) that wants more than anything to impersonate from Disney's Brave. Their attraction becomes a problem for the couple as love is verboten from this empire. Tragedy befalls the lovers as is the case in all fairy tales. Fast forward to seven years later. Our hunky woodsman is requested to help his queen. So, with two dwarfs in tow, Gryff (Rob Brydon) and Nion (Nick Frost), the latter seeming to be channel Ricky Gervasis comedy act without the laughs, they are off to battle anyone who gets in their way.&#xfffc;The various perils they face aren't anyway near compelling and the action scenes are not well staged. who served as visual effects supervisor in the last outing takes over the director's reins and does an adequate job. He keeps the story moving forward, without much panache, and the film looks nice. Production values are uniformly strong. In fact, the CGI work is very effective in the film's climactic scene, although it lacks polish throughout. (In comparison, the original film, Snow White and the Huntsman (2012), had a wonderful surreal edginess that this film rarely achieves.)However, the main area of displeasure is the woeful script by that relies on voice-over narration to explain the exposition and has the underdeveloped characters scrambling for their own identities. One just doesn't care about the film's totally predictable plot or the dilemmas that these one-note characters must overcome.The actors add little to these sketchy roles. Ms. Theron has more of a supporting role here and is in dire need of more screen time to resuscitate the film before it flat-lines. Mr. Hemsworth, as the Huntsman, is still in search of a character. He plays him more as a Gaston second-string buffoon rather than a first-rate real hero. Ms Blunt is his worthy adversary but her character is far too restrained and lacks genuine menace. She plays her role like a cartoon version of Elsa in Frozen, which is the writers' main inspiration I suppose. Jessica Chastain's talents are wasted in this token women empowerment heroine. She's a spitfire, a redhead babe with determination and verve. Alright, we get it. Now move on.The Huntsman: Winter's War is more of the same with less of the excitement as the original, which, come to think about it, wasn't that thrilling either. What this film lacks in originality is just that.Visit my blog at: www.dearmoviegoer.comANY COMMENTS: Please contact me at: jadepietro@rcn.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not a fairytale, not much of a adventure, not inspiring, not really a comedy or romance...It looks like someone just put all the ingredients in the movie imagination mixer, added some nonsense, and let the audience try it! I tried it and I'd rather go for a mango smoothie or orange juice. Don't really know what was the idea here, I almost fell asleep and I left the movie theater with the feeling that I wasted two good hours of my life. The good news is, I am not repeating the experience. Bye bye for these nonsense movies. Why wonder how such movie gets approved by all the involved parties prior to production. Maybe somebody lost parts of the screen writing and had to patch it up in a very tight scheduled, so this person rushed to watch a dozen of Walt Disney, Pixar and similar production and hand wrote the patch-up to meet the deadlines. Maybe a rat ate part of it, I don't know, this movie was really not worth seeing it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Let it go" Universal, Disney already has dibs on the Snow Queen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Prepare for the unnecessary prequel/sequel Huntsman: Winter's War this weekend. It won't take long for you to realize that you have seen this story before. Albeit, a more family friendly and Disney'd version, but this plot nevertheless. However, after researching the actual Hans Christian Andersen fairly tale The Snow Queen, it is clear that Universal Pictures does a more accurate job of adapting the fairy tale's words than Frozen did. The problem with this attempt is that it feels like it's coming around a little too late. With one-dimensional characters and a predictable plot, Huntsman attempts to tell the "real" story of the Snow Queen that appeals to teens and adults, but it looks so incredibly "Frozen" that it leaves you feeling like you've done this all before. Although there are increased action and romance scenes in the film, the whole idea of close sisters having a falling out, the one heading to the frozen north, while the other remains in the south with the north creeping on its doorstep, and love melting frozen hearts, is the foundation of the narrative and feels like a bad case of deja vu with little to add.Travel back to the land of Snow White, and come face to face with a little known story that has yet to be told. Before poison apples and dwarfs, Queen Ravenna (Charlize Theron) and her sister were running the kingdom after the death of the good king (Snow White's father). Ravenna's younger sister Freya (Emily Blunt) falls in love with a man promised to another woman but has come to bare his child. After Freya finds her lover having set fire to the nursery and the innocent child, Freya becomes acutely overcome with anger, grief, and hatred and suddenly displays powers of ice and snow. Unable to control her anger and power, Ravenna send her sister to the north to find a kingdom of her own. After having her child murdered, Freya decides to raise a kingdom by making love illegal and taking children from villages and raising them up as warriors known as huntsman. When she finds that two of the huntsman Brighton (Chris Hemsworth) and Sara (Jessica Chastain) have committed the unpardonable sin of falling in love, Freya steps in to put a stop to their forbidden love. Banished from the kingdom of the frozen north, Brighton is contacted by Snow White's kingdom to retrieve the infamous mirror filled with dark magic before it falls into the wrong hands.Every once in a while, I come across a movie that really doesn't require a lengthy description of the critical elements of the film; and this is one of those. Just felt very much under-developed and forced. Anyone who has seen Frozen?and let's face it, that's practically everyone whether they wanted to or not?will instantly pickup on the parallels between both movies. Huntsman: Winter's War is definitely geared towards an adult audience but it still feels like it stole many elements from Frozen. Even the coloring and costuming are very similar. For those who have examined Frozen from a critical perspective and read up on the development of the blockbuster, you may be familiar with the evolution of the script: it starts out as an adaptation of The Snow Queen but then the writers scrapped that idea for more of a contemporary Disney animated feature story. But then the writers didn't like that direction either, they essentially took the first half of the first draft of the script and spliced it together with the second half of the second draft, added in some catchy music and boom! You have Frozen. Huntsman is similar to what you would have got in Frozen had the first draft been the produced movie.On the plus side, this film contains some beautiful imagery and simple but stunning visual effects. The goblins are extremely well done?too bad you get so little time with them in a scene that is completely removable from the rest of the film. That scene and others were clearly under- budgeted and under-developed. Despite the fact that you can watch this movie in D-Box and IMAX, there is really no reason to spend the extra money. Watching it in a standard auditorium will suffice perfectly. If you want to get a better idea of the darkness of the original Hans Christian Andersen fairy tale before Elsa and Anna, then you may enjoy this movie. However, if you would rather wait for it to be on Amazon Prime or iTunes, then that works too.</fullReview>

It seemed that none or 9 out of ten just could not take this seriously which in some cases is fine but I expect a lot more with a cast of this quality.

		<shortDescription>Unnecessary Sequel and Unimpressive Fairy Tale</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not sure whether Universal Pictures is desperate to repeat their box office dominating success as in 2015, this prequel/ sequel to 2012's Snow White and the Huntsman feels to be pointless, uneven and unnecessary. The film does not learn from the mistakes of its predecessor especially in term of pacing that is two times much slower for the entire first hour, fills with relentless cheesy and humorless dialogues, irrelevant romantic scenes, then immediately rushes into short and unimpressive climax. It gathers a great cast, Charlize Theron as the Evil Queen looks tremendous with her outstanding performance but unexpectedly limited by screen time; Emily Blunt is cool as the Ice Queen while the chemistry between Chris Hemsworth and Jessica Chastain is dull due to the main theme about love and betrayal is poorly crafted into this clumsily-penned fantasy tale. Overall, it is an easily forgotten sequel that has totally wasted the talents of its cast, lacks of moral satisfaction and seems to be an empty lackluster concept of Frozen - Lord of the Rings combination that clearly should have "let it go" at the first place.</fullReview>

A few special effects lift this movie on occasion and Blunt and Theron do their best to be mean, apart from that the movie provides nothing new or interesting.We did not really need this, sort of, prequel/sequel to the first movie, it provides nothing extra from the original. Reading my review back, I think 5 out of 10 is actually generous for this movie, all round a bit of a waste of time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Huntsman: Winter's War Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For people like myself who don't earn six digits income and above, we need to be extremely picky when visiting the cinema. We really need to be sure if the trip is worth it. If you are in my shoes, please keep your money and stay home. Why?The trending release this week is The Huntsman: Winter's War. It's a sequel to Snow White and the Huntsman. I had zero expectation for The Huntsman: Winter's War when I saw its trailer on MTV at the MTV (viewers' choice) Movie Awards. This is because it took me three days to watch its prequel Snow White and the Huntsman. I kept sleeping off while watching the movie.I must admit the movie was better than its predecessor but also had its disappointing elements. The computer graphics (CG) was inconsistent as always. Some elements had perfect CG that was realistic and pleasant but some were just glossy, shiny, and annoyingly fake looking.The movie and its prequel didn't really sync. The story seemed obviously forced. The Hobbit franchise and the Lord of the Rings franchise synced so well you might think The Hobbit had been planned before Lord of the Rings. The team started a romantic relationship between The Huntsman and Snow White in Snow White and the Huntsman ? they even shared true love's kiss. The entire relationship was abandoned for another in Winter's War.Fantasy is one of my favourite genre but when every scene is jam- packed with mystical creatures that have no relevance to the plot, then there is a problem. Rather than invest time in the story, plot and portrayals, they were busy making fairies, goblins, weird tortoise, and weird snakes.continue this review at http://cinemashoulds.wordpress.com/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't believe sequels/prequels in and of themselves are bad things. If there is a worthwhile story to be told and the motivation behind a film's creation is driven primarily from a desire to create something of value rather than simply using a recognisable property to make some easy money then why should a film be devalued because it is a continuation, or a re-imagining. However when a film does feel unwarranted, and offers a minimal appropriation for its own existence, it is rather natural to become somewhat frustrated at the lackadaisical attitude of film making on display. With that in mind let's take a look at The Huntsmen: Winter's War.Taking place before the events of Snow White and The Huntsmen Freya (Emily Blunt), sister of Ravenna (Charlize Theron), has given birth to a child. When the baby is killed by its father Freya's dormant ice powers burst forth and she kidnaps children from their families in order to build an army. Two of these children, Eric (Chris Hemsworth) and Sara (Jessica Chastain), fall in love (Which Freya has forbidden) which leads them to rebel against her rule.The films overly convoluted narrative structure makes it a strenuous and confusing viewing. It serves as both a prequel, and a sequel, to Snow White and the Huntsmen but feels unimpressively stitched together. It never finds a unique voice of its own, whilst being riddled with cliché, and incoherent storytelling. The addition of Emily Blunt as Freya seems like an attempt to appeal to the massive Frozen fan base to see a grittier live action interpretation of the character of Elsa, one whose motivations seem ridiculous and implausible. I've never seen Emily Blunt seem so lethargic and lifeless. As a fantastic actress it has taken some truly exhaustively dour writing to dull her remarkable talents, but dulled she is. Charlize Theron doesn't chew the scenery, but delves into a three course meal of performance excess, whilst Jessica Chastain is wasted completely as the shallowly characterised Sara. Hemsworth has a lot of charm and charisma, but even he wears thin as the film concludes. The comical support of Nick Frost, Rob Brydon and Sheridan Smith as a group of dwarfs are pretty hit and miss, though Smith is unarguably the stand out ensemble performer. Winter's War is the directorial debut of visual effects artist Cedric Nicolas- Troyan (Who worked on the previous film) and unsurprisingly some of the interesting visual designs are the films strongest aspect, such as Ravenna's magic mirror and Freya's ice owl.Winter's War is a poorly constructed time sink. A handful of nicely assorted special effects and a couple of astutely choreographed fight scenes aside there isn't anything of merit or substance. If you were a fan of the first film and are searching for more detail and back-story regarding the characters then this may have some interest for you, however the incoherence of the narrative and the competency of the execution may leave you in want. Again sequels/prequels are not negative things in of themselves, and there are numerous examples to prove this. The Huntsmen: Winters War is not one of these though, and hopefully we will see the talented cast and crew of this feature embark on a project more deserving of their time in the future.Review by Alexander Halsall.

		<fullReview>In this sequel continuing the Snow White fable, without the originality of the point of view of the first one, the film entertains and not much else. Actually sometimes you don't even know if this movie it's a prequel or a sequel. But the production values are high and the special effects are good. The sad thing is that three of Hollywood's most powerful and talented female actors get lost in a storm of special effects, but Hemsworth is so charming as always, and remains an excellent Huntsman. Overall, "The Huntsman: Winter's War" feels like a movie that didn't need making and there's so much talent on display here that it's sad to see it wasted, but there is a little magic too in this movie and that's enough for me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A sequel to the handsome, but tepid, 'Snow White and the Huntsman' was probably not necessary, but make one they have.Confusingly it combines elements of a prequel too, which clutters the narrative and generally messes up what should be a fairly simple story (remember, the core elements of a fairy tale are all basically the same: handsome hero, beautiful heroine, wicked and usually female villain, some small people for comic relief).There are some interesting characters and some game playing from this good cast in a film which happily ups the feminist ante. Most of the male characters are ineffectual or misogynist, so Emily Blunt as the frostiest of ice Queen's and Sheridan Smith as a foul- mouthed, spiky female dwarf romp away with the acting honours.</fullReview>

I liked the first one until the strange ending that felt"twilight" like.This just felt all wrong from the beginning and it just feels forced to please the audience and ,doing so, make it very predictable. It also seems Chris Hemsworth has no chemistry with any of the female leads he has played with so far and in this it's no different.The 2 sisters story reminded me of "frozen"and I found the ice effects far from great. Charlize Theron was solid but these roles are starting to feel bland and to much typecasting.It's a bad sequel to a not so good movie to begin with, this could of been a turn around with an actual continuation and maybe wait a little longer with making this movie.I really don't need a third installment for this and I'm certainly not gonna watch that.I think this was a fan service screenplay trying to undo all that was wrong with the first film,sadly,they made all the same mistakes again.This is lazy storytelling,I don't recommend it.The first was a nice step for worth but this is two steps back.A let down.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A really uninspiring piece of storytelling, that wastes a lot of potential goods in a really messy fantasy picture that never manages to find a voice or a tonal coherence. Looking at the cast involved you cannot keep yourself from calling this a disappointment, even if its predecessor didn't really make us wish for this, nor it was a quality film.Right off the bat you don't understand what to make of this. The storytelling is way too jumbled and uneven. Whilst I do commend the film for having some nice twists at best and a couple of good characters with a somewhat interesting development, the movie never manages to emerge from mediocrity and keeps treading ground that has been exhaustively covered in the past, to the point that you end up with a collection of too many emotional beats that have almost no gravitas because of how many times you've seen them and how ingrained in the genre they are.The fact is that I repeatedly found the screenplay of the movie quite passable. The overall archs and interlacement of characters is interesting and with the exception of the story missteps mentioned above, there was a valid narrative trying to emerge. Unfortunately, first time director, Cedric Nicolas-Troyan does not manage to make a flowing film out of it. There is no voice or style implemented in here, it all feels so dull and generic, not even when I was trying hard to get absorbed I found something to connect to. The shot choices are really uninspired, it covers the film with a layer of dullness that is really hard to shake off. Moreover, other than some artistically pleasing visual effects, not even the action scenes manage to give the viewer something to stick with. They all happen mechanically, without any real storytelling going on and they are all fast cutting and headache inducing.The four main actors in the film do deserve the majority of the praise. They all have characters that can't be really defined as engrossing, but they all have something to tell and thanks to the talent of these people, all of them manage to dig deep into them and bring out at least something to sink your teeth in. They are repeatedly undermined by a messy narrative and a dull pace, yet still find a way to stick out.Look this isn't in anyway a terrible film, you probably won't hear any angry reviews coming out of it and on the contrary, there will be people that find a beat in it. But for the me and probably the majority of the audience, this will just be a forgettable, generic narrative that wasted a good amount of potential.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Huntsman, Frozen en Narnia</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Am I the only one who thinks this movie is a mix of the previous Huntsman movie, Frozen and the chronicles of Narnia? The movie itself was OK. Not a very creative plot. Very predictable. I could've done without the lengthy intro and narrating of Aslan, I mean Liam Neeson. The movie got better after that. I liked the dwarfs bickering and some fight scenes but besides that it was quite boring up to the scenes where Charlize Theron appeared. 10 out of 10 for her. She was amazing! Best scene is when queen Elsa, I mean Freya, goes up to the mirror, and releases her sister. The movie ending was a bit cheesy with the whole kissy lovey dovey scene. Without Charlize it would not be worth going to in my opinion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Banking on Frozen.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With the first movie, Universal took a story that Disney was famous for telling and made it their own. In this sequel, they seemed to forget about making it different though.The main villain in this movie is the Ice Queen, who has many qualities of Hans Christian Anderson's character. Oddly enough that would be the same character that Disney draws from for Elsa in their hit Frozen. Seems Universal couldn't come up with their own idea in this franchise in continuing to make it their own. While the movie itself is good, full of action, and tells a decent story, it is blatantly obvious that their trying to ride on the tailcoats of Disney and Frozen.Additionally, elements from other movies can be seen here. The Hobbit/Lord of the Rings seemed to be channeled in this production as well.Try again, Universal. Except next time, be a little more original.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>watched the film with friends, didn't expect much from it, but damn was i still disappointed.The film starts of with the back story to the ice queen and Ravenna, but it doesn't make sense as this is a story that we already were told when we were children and had loved it as a cartoon film in 50's or 60's but this origin of the ice queen is so terribly bad full of the films most clichés isn't even funny bad, but just plain bad.Acting, i heard a rumor that Chris couldn't say his lines properly, so there was a lot of ADR Automatic dialogue replacement had to be done. Didn't believe it until i start noticing that every line the Chris says is done from the side or the back of his face, or a long shot where you can not see his face or his mouth clearly.The story, the acting and dialogue were all terrible, just simply terrible. was a very disappointing sequel to a not very good film to beginning with.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is a really bad movie!! #goldenraspberry2017 for Emily Blunt and Charlize Theron. They play was a disaster. Some of the characters were pretty cool, though. I really liked all of the dwarfs Also, I enjoyed few scenes, especially the fight with the golden apes. Overall the story line is really trivial and sometimes a bit confusing- i.e. the scene "7 years later" when so many new characters appear. They are not introduced or anything and the scene looks like you were supposed to already know them- they are talking like this. Does not make any sense. Some scenes are also so stupid. Others are kinda funny: "I am sometimes thirsty when it is hot"- the best flirt ever! Overall, I do not regret seeing this movie, but unless you are really bored, don't go to the cinema!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Huntsman Winter's War had great potential. It could have been a very beautiful, lavish, CGI-bomb. Calling a movie a CGI bomb is usually negative, but isn't that what we want for a live action fairy tale? Well, we didn't get that.The main culprits here are the writers. They could have written a very luxurious, very shiny movie. We see hints of that in the final ten minutes with Levanna and her interesting powers. However, once again, we didn't get that.The big war with Levanna and her black ink that has been hogging up the trailers is literally in the last few minutes of the movie. How disappointing. Instead, Hemsworth and Chastain hold up the entire movie. I'm not sure about you, but I don't care about them.The real stars are Blunt and Theron. Give us them! Give us their epic battle with their powers against one another! Not just for the final few minutes! I see lots of people claiming that the critics are wrong here, that it actually was a good movie... No. For once, I agree with the critics on a movie.This movie was brimming with potential - but also brimming with plot-holes when compared to the first movie.Do not watch!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If The Huntsmen: Winter's War wants follow Disney's Frozen, then it needs to not be a copycat and "Let it Go"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When Star Wars was released, there was a whole galaxy of science fiction movies that weren't just trying to borrow ideas it, but flat out duplicate it with works such as Battle Beyond the Stars and Krull. The reason for the sudden attack from copycats is that everyone always wants to imitate off of what's popular. It happened with Star Wars and it also happened in the fantasy genre when Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter came out. Each fantasy film that was released did everything to make sure their movies were on that similar scale. One such movie from 2012 was Snow White and the Huntsman. The movie came out around the same time when adapting fairy tales into epics were a major thing (it also came out close to the dreadful Mirror, Mirror). Snow White and the Huntsman wasn't bad, but it was story that was simply forgettable. But being it made money at the box office, it was without a doubt that a sequel would get produced. But then Frozen happened in 2013. This set a new standard on what fairy tale movies should be. You can tell in The Huntsman: Winter's War that too wanted to get in on the Frozen hype. At first, the movie is a prequel showing the evil sorceress Ravenna (played by Charlize Theron) has a younger sister Freya (played by Emily Blunt) who has yet to discover her magical powers. A set up from Ravenna tricks Freya into thinking that her lover has killed her child. This causes the reveal of Freya's ice powers when she freezes her flame. This also gives Freya motivation to take an army, invade another kingdom, and declare it who own icy reign. She then sets up a system of kidnapping children to build them a part of her army. One of these children is a younger Eric.Eric (played by Chris Hemsworth) grows into a strong young man who also falls for a fellow warrior Sara (played by Jessica Chastain). Freya has forbidden love in her kingdom, so she creates an ice wall that supposedly shows the death of Sara. This causes Eric to retreat to Ravenna's kingdom. Cut to seven years after the events of the first movie, Eric is informed that the magic mirror was taken and could prove to be a vital threat to Snow White's kingdom. Accompanied by two dwarfs Nion (played by Nick Frost) and Gryff (played by Rob Brydon) he ventures on another adventure to find the mirror and defeat Freya.While a sequel does seem unnecessary, I do think there was potential in giving the Huntsman his own story. Unfortunately, not only does this suffer some of the same problems as the original, it creates new ones. Pacing wise, it's all over the place with a dull introduction to try an explain Emily Blunt's role as a sister years before, simply taking too long for the actual plot to get going. Speaking of which, you can tell that Emily Blunt must have been under contract, because she's gives very little investment into her ice queen character who only seems to be evil as her personality. This is strange as the rest of that cast seems to be trying their best, but the script gives them very little to work with. I'll admit that the design and the effects are still pretty good, but is that enough? Well?part of me can't shake the feeling that the movie is really relying on the Disney success of movies like Frozen and Brave, which feel present through this. The audience I sat with seemed to sense the same thing, which was that The Huntsman: Winter's War is nothing more an attempted "cash grab" at what's popular with fantasy.I'll give this three ice walls out of ten. I barley remember what happened in Snow White and the Huntsman and I'll doubt I'll remember the entirety of The Huntsman: Winter's War. If Universal really wants to follow Disney and Frozen, perhaps they should stop playing copycat and "Let it Go".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Their was no need for this sequel/prequel?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Where do I start? Right, to begin, I did like Snow white and the Huntsman and did really like what director Rupert Sanders did with the cliché tale and characters. He turned Snow White into this heroine and a leader, the Huntsman into this broken character who had a broken past as well, Charlize Theron's Evil queen was great and she wasn't just evil for the sake of 'being evil' which added depth to the character and the whole darker feel to the tale and film. But The Huntsman is a mess start to finish. First of all, The Huntsman was pitched as a prequel, when really it spends 15 minutes before the original film and the rest of the film after it. which means they were treating the audience like idiots and they put anything in the trailer's just to get people to go see it. Secondly, the new story just seemed really forced. The whole film just seemed like the studio was trying to make more money. The characters was completely off, especially Chris Hemsworth, his character was completely different in this movie, I know most of the movie does take place after the previous film and you could be happy that the war had stopped, but no one goes from being grumpy and sad to being happy and telling jokes that fall flat. Things are horribly shoe- horned with absolutely no effort. One character is just their just to give the huntsman a plot, like he actually says the plot in one line, other characters such as the dwarfs are just there to add comic relief to an already bald script and most of the humour is slap stick such as swearing and has no effort and the worst shoe-horned thing was trying to make both of the movies relevant. The name is even misleading it's not even a war it's more of a sight disagreement. in a nutshell, The Huntsmen was made to get more money not for the enjoyment of the public.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"The Huntsman: Winter's War" reflects poorly on the original.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Help! The movies are merging! The movies are merging! The release of 2016's "The Huntsman: Winter's War" (PG-13, 1:54) comes shortly before the release of "Captain America: Civil War", which is a sequel to 2014's "Captain America: The Winter Soldier"! What's more, "The Huntsman: Winter's War", which appears from its theatrical trailers to be a prequel to 2012's "Snow White and the Huntsman", is actually part prequel and part sequel, much like 2014's "300: Rise of an Empire" was to 2006's "300"! To top it off, the 2016 "Huntsman" film features two royal sisters becoming estranged, with one of them (who has powers to create ice with a wave of her hand) moving into the wilderness, causing the kingdom to fall into a never-ending winter ? very similar to 2003's "Frozen" ? and both movies are partially based on Hans Christian Andersen's 1844 fairy tale "The Snow Queen"! It's a good thing the "Huntsman" films aren't also animated (although, with all that CGI they might as well be)! After seeing and reviewing well over 500 movies in the past few years alone, keeping all this straight is a bit challenging? but I'll do my best to hold it together long enough to give you my original, fair and open-minded review of the 2016 prequel-sequel "The Huntsman: Winter's War".The film begins with the story of how the beautiful but evil queen Ravenna (Charlize Theron) used her (unexplained) evil powers to rise to evil power. (Apparently regicide was not new to Ravenna when we saw her do it in the first film.) The only person for whom Ravenna has feelings (evil feelings, but less evil than her run-of-the-mill evil) is her sweet and loving sister, Freya (Emily Blunt). However, a family tragedy results in the emergence of Freya's (unexplained) power to freeze things? people? the air? even entire kingdoms, as she embarks on the slippery slope of her own kind of evil. Seceding from her sister's kingdom and establishing one of her own up north, she immediately has many of her new subjects murdered and steals their children. She sets the boys (and girls) to training as an elite fighting force of "huntsmen", capable of plundering neighboring kingdoms, killing their leaders and taking their lands. (Freya calls the huntsmen her "army", but we never see more of them together than could form a small platoon.) And she has one major unbreakable rule ("sin", as she calls it): Don't love ? at all. "Love is a trick played by the cruel on the foolish and the weak," she says. (Sounds like someone needs a hug!) Many years later, Freya's best male huntsman, Eric (Chris Hemsworth), and best female huntsman, Sara (Jessica Chastain), are all grown up ? and in love. (Kids just don't listen.) When Freya finds out about the affair, Eric is (literally) thrown out of the kingdom. He is left to roam the forest, pining for his lost love ? for seven years ? the period of time in which the events of "Snow White and the Huntsman" are said to take place. (Snow White is virtually ignored in this movie ? and Ravenna's loyal and ruthless brother from the first film isn't even mentioned.) Eric is found by King William (Sam Claflin) who enlists his help in finding Ravenna's old evil mirror, which is now missing, and take it to a safe place called "sanctuary", which is never shown. He is joined by two male dwarfs (Nick Frost and Rob Brydon) and then by two female dwarfs (Sheridan Smith and Alexandra Roach) and by one more huntsman. They take on a pack of ugly, murdering goblins, and then Freya and her elite warriors. (Well, it really IS a very nice mirror.) Out of respect for the film's impressive plot twists sprinkled throughout its second and third acts, I'll refrain from explaining anything else about the story in any detail, but, to finish my plot summary, I've prepared a list of "10 Things I Learned in 'The Huntsman: Winter's War'". I have made these statements purposely vague and stripped them of any details that might otherwise qualify as spoilers, in order to make a point about the movie with this paragraph. Here are the "Top 10": (10) Breaking a mirror can give you seven years of bad luck retroactively. (That must be called the "grandfather queen" clause.) (9) Images viewed through clear ice can be unreliable. (8) "Sanctuary" is a place where goblins store magic mirrors that they kill for, but don't use. (7) Little people of opposite genders find each other repulsive, but they still have babies. (6) Some families just randomly develop evil powers. (5) A person can bleed out onto a flat surface 12" in front of him with no visible wounds on the man's body. (4) An arrow can be stopped by a metal object, yet still lodge in someone's chest ? and do so without killing that person. (3) There's a state of being somewhere between life and death that doesn't involve zombies or Elvis Presley sightings. (2) A ruler can remove love from an entire kingdom just by pronouncing it banned. (1) Back in the day, they had wi-fi in the forest and the routers looked a lot like white owls. (Have I made my point?) "The Huntsman: Winter's War" reflects poorly on the original film. Many of the details and plot points are silly (see previous paragraph) and the story is formulaic and uninspired. This film has fewer dwarfs, but more creatures than the last one, the stepped-up use of CGI feeling as if it's intended to make up for what's lacking in the story. On the other hand, the visual effects are impressive, the fight scenes and other action are entertaining and the plot twists really are cool. None of that totally makes up for what is mostly a dumb and derivative exercise in cinematic mediocrity, but it's enough to keep me from totally trashing the film. "C-"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I haven't met anyone that liked this movie and I COMPLETELY GET WHY!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>MOVIE REVIEW and there's a VIDEO REVIEW on my channel (My own opinion so don't read it if you don't care): If I had to call this movie one thing it would be awful. This movie is about the snow queen who's child dies so she wants to rid the world of love. That is by far the dumbest villain motivation I have heard in awhile. It doesn't even make any sense. The fact that this movie even got made doesn't even make any sense to me. The plot line is thin with nothing new. The characters are one dimensional and the romance they have with one another especially Chris Hemsworth and his love interest is a joke in the film. This movie also can't decide if it wants to be a prequel, sequel, or a reboot which is laughable at times. The ending has a plot twist which I won't spoil but it was the most predictable plot twist that I've probably seen from a movie in a couple of years. This movie is as bad as it gets and isn't even enjoyable to watch. I have seen almost every movie this year and even I enjoyed God's of Egypt more then this. At least I could laugh in that movie from how bad it was. Don't see this cause you'd be wasting your time with this movie. This movie has no redeeming qualities so I won't even try to look for one. I hate this movie and I hate that that Hollywood thinks they can make this cash grab of a movie because they think their audience is going to support this. I know people have opinions and I respect that but I haven't met a single person that has liked this movie so far.&#xfeff; Movie's can be broken up into different categories and for this movie I can say Acting is mediocre, film making is mediocre, Plot is terrible, Characters are bland, Romance is Forced, Ending is horrendous, and Plot twist is sooooo predictable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Prequel, Sequel or Spin Off???</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Cedric Nicolas-Troyan, who served as Second Unit Director on both "Maleficent" and "Snow White &amp; The Huntsman," makes a less than dazzling cinematic debut as the director of "The Huntsman: Winter's War" with Chris Hemsworth, Charlize Theron, Jessica Chastain, and Emily Blunt. This ambitious but lackluster Universal Pictures release fails to live up to its impressive predecessor and struggles to accommodate a burgeoning franchise as either a prequel or a sequel. Ultimately, "The Huntsman" amounts to more of a superficial spin-off. The first film with its dark but imaginative adaptation of the oft-told Grimm's fairy tale emerged as a enchanting epic. Unfortunately, neither "Twilight" actress Kristen Stewart who toplined "Snow White &amp; the Huntsman" nor director Rupert Sanders who helmed the 2012 release that garnered $395 million globally and generated $155 million of those receipts domestically had anything to do with the half-baked follow-up film. Mind you, Troyan wasn't the first choice to call the shots on "The Huntsman." Three time Oscar nominee Frank Darabont who directed both "The Green Mile" and "The Shawshank Redemption" signed on to direct "The Huntsman," but he withdrew after creative differences with the studio. Troyan stepped into replace Darabont. Clearly, Troyan he stepped into a film that should have been put out to pasture with the other piles. If these misguided maneuvers behind the scenes weren't enough to sink "The Huntsman," you have to consider the derivative plot that is not only second-rate but also obviously indebted to the Walt Disney blockbuster "Frozen." Scenarist Evan Spiliotopoulos, who penned the screenplays of such Disney movies as "Tinker Bell and the Lost Treasure" as well as "The Little Mermaid: Ariel's Beginning," has modeled one of the two villainess in "The Huntsman" on the Elsa character in the "Frozen." Unless you've seen "Frozen," you'd probably think that Spiliotopoulos had borrowed the idea of a woman who can freeze people until they turn into ice crystals from the Rogue character in the Twentieth Century Fox Marvel "X-Men" franchise. The surprising thing is that Disney hasn't cried foul about such a transparently obvious imitation."The Huntsman" functions as an origins prequel during its first half-hour. Troyan and his writers present the evil Ravenna (Charlize Theron of "Mad Max: Fury Road") before she married Snow White's father. Apparently, she acts like a serial slayer of sorts who liquidates one husband after another. Ravenna's husband, an anonymous monarch that she has wed, dies under mysterious but supernatural circumstances during a chess match while they are alone together. After his death, Ravenna rules over his kingdom, and we are informed by omnipresent narrator (Liam Neeson) that he was among many who fell victim to her venomous charms. At the same time, we encounter Ravenna's younger sister, the impressionable Freya (Emily Blunt of "Loopers"), who is pregnant with the child of a Duke. Ravenna warns Freya that the Duke will disavow her since he is engaged to marry another dame. Although the Duke lives up to his promise to Freya, disaster strikes later and Freya's infant daughter dies under mysterious circumstances apparently at the hands of the Duke who cremated her with fire. We only see smoke rising from the cradle. Ravenna has told Freya that one day she?Freya?will discover her gifts just as Ravenna discovered her own gifts as a sorceress. The hideous death of her daughter prompts Freya to freeze the Duke in his tracks. Freya reviles love and leaves Ravenna to create her own kingdom in the North and she wields her icy wrath without a qualm. She wipes out all her immediate adversaries with an army that she has recruited from the children that she has abducted from the families of her enemies. This concept is reminiscent of the science fiction movie "Ender's Game" with Harrison Ford as well as the Netflix movie "Beast of No Nation" with Idris Elba. Among those children that Freya has recruited are Eric and Sara who grow up to be played by Chris Hemsworth and Jessica Chastain. If you remember "Snow White and the Huntsman," Eric lamented the death of his wife Sara. In "The Huntsman," Eric and Sara serve Freya faithfully throughout several bloodthirsty campaigns against her foes. Secretly, they become attracted to each other and Sara 'marries' Eric in a hot springs one night when she drapes a medallion that her mother gave her around his neck. Naturally, Freya discovers this relationship and takes them to task for it. The first rule of Freya's kingdom is that love is a sin. Promptly, Freya has Sara killed and banishes Eric.The remainder of its 114 minutes isn't exactly a sequel. You can catch glimpses of Kristen Stewart in the flashback sequences and you'll see her husband, King William of Tabor (Sam Claflin of "The Hunger Games") invoke Snow White's royal name when he approaches Eric about an important mission. Snow White has taken ill because of Ravenna's notorious mirror and she had sent an armed escort to take the mirror to safe location. The escort was slaughtered during the mission, and Snow White wants Eric to recover the mirror. Uneven best describes "The Huntsman," and the contrived half-measures that Troyan and his scenarists attempt to preserve some semblance of a sequel seem labored at best. Typically, when a movie rakes in a million dollar plus haul, the studios keep the original director unless he has brokered a bigger deal for another movie. Most sequels try to reunite the original cast but Universal appears to have ostracized Stewart and undoubted her fans will be disappointed at her lack of participation. Indeed, "The Huntsman" antes up two surprises that anybody with half a brain can see coming. Hollywood doesn't kill off two major characters in the first part of the sprawling adventure saga and leave them to molder in death. Nudge, Nudge; Wink, Wink; Know what I mean. Quite often Hemsworth and Chastain speak in accents that challenge your ears. Altogether, "The Huntsman: Winter's War" ranks as a stinker.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Blah. Its a completely color by number type of action movie that is aimed at teenage girls. It is centered around the typical stronger then men fighting warrior woman, that (for the typical boring reasons of movie logic) can easily beat up men bigger and more muscular then she is. This is done to flatter young impressionable teenage girls. Somehow the teen females of today have decided that unless a movie portrays women as being unrealistically physically capable, they are not doing things right. So we are stuck with the Buffy style Mary Sue. The perfect in every way female that is stronger then everyone, meaner then everyone, can't be bothered to treat people fairly, or to listen to anyone's point of view. In fact its basically not a character. Its just a compilation of all the things that people attribute to women, and doing the opposite. Anyone with the mental age of more then ten will be bored silly, so some people will like it. We left the theater.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Snow White and the huntsman with Kristen Stewart was absolutely fantastic because surprise surprise girls and women actually want to see badass women on screen! Men however seem to claim they do but when the lady hero is so independent that she doesn't necessarily make her life revolve around a man, all men freak out because then she suddenly doesn't exist for them (which no ladies do, spoiler alert). This was the worst movie I've seen in the cinema since Lone Ranger. This movie was so boring that I literally pulled my phone out sometime in the last third of it and went on the internet instead. I thought it would be amazing because of not one, not two, but a whole three kickass ladies in it! But even they couldn't save this train wreck. All the jokes fall flat, the forbidden heterosexual romance storyline(s) was just....do straight people not get tired of seeing themselves over and over a gazillion times? If you loved Snow White for all the right reasons: lady hero, great plot, good effects, lady hero, a lack of straight white men saving the day - then there's a chance you might not love this. Save yourself some money and rent this when it comes out if you really think you want to see it. And with the rest of your money you can buy a piece of fruit or candy which will be way more delicious and pleasing than this trashfest.</fullReview>
