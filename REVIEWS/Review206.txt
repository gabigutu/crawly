		<shortDescription>Lots of reviews by cult members</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't review movies here BUT I read the extremely negative reviews and was curious. All were by new members with this being either their only review or maybe one or two additional ones done soon after to legitimize their reviewing credentials. Obvious plants by the still faithful. Sadly they are still out there. Their reviews did not have the result intended. They piqued my curiosity and I sought out this film. If you are fascinated by cults or a fan of documentaries seek this film out. It's a rare thing to have this much inside footage of a cult leader and his followers in action. To outsiders the machinations of this vain Svengali seem transparent and obvious. So vain that he was the one who had all of this footage shot. Meeting the members you gain insight, sympathy and understanding as to how and why seemingly intelligent, aware individuals can be swept up by someone and something like this. The film is well constructed, clear, emotional and does have a point of view. That point of view is what gives this film it's fire and passion. It's made by ex cult members and boy are they angry. It doesn't pretend to be a cold, objective view on what went on there and I think it is better for it. Imagine a film about Scientology made by angry ex-members or a film about the Manson family made by a disillusioned, embarrassed, remorseful ex-member. Oh the truths we'd learn! My only complaint is that I wanted a cathartic confrontation with the cult leader at the end. There is a confrontation but it seems muted and sad rather than explosive and angry. See this well made documentary if you can. It's an eight but I'm giving it a ten to counterbalance those idiotic one star reviews.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Essential Viewing for all Seekers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Excellent documentary that gives a first hand look into the power of social influence in a group dynamic. This film is a study of a teacher who has abused his power and uses his social influence to manipulate and control the members of the cult. It's equally parts disturbing and inspiring as the cult members seek the truth and expose the teacher to gain their back their own freedom of mind. If you are interested in how cults operate from an insider's perspective, this film is invaluable. A must see for all everyone as the lessons here run deep and the journey of the members is both moving and profound.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Over twenty year documentary of buddhafield cult</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wow! I loved it! I stumbled upon this on CNN, and started watching because of my love for documentaries, and interest in the bizarre, such as cults. My review is based on what I thought of the movie, and not the accuracy of what some other members of the cult think. First of all, it's hilarious, and I mean hilarious! The movie keeps moving never a dull moment. I had to google this cult when I completed the movie, because I thought it was a mockumentary. I was wrong. It really happened. Lastly, if you are currently in this cult, please get more footage so I don't have to join it to get my own. There is enough footage to judge for yourself whether or not you believe this is a true account, or whether wrong was done. Cult members always remind me of drug addicts, or drug users, they are there for a reason. Drug addicts will always tell you how bad drugs are and how it ruined their life. Drug users will tell you about the fun and crazy times they had, and why they occasionally use them. One is a positive experience, and the other a negative one, but for the same thing. This movie does a good job at conveying the differences in cult members opinions. The reviews I read discussed these issues, and no mention of humor. Trust me, this movie is absolutely hilarious.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Shoulda listened to my friend who saw this on its first day and spent my time doing something else, but the ticket was in my hand and it got me out of the cold Utah weather, so I guess there's that. Holy Hell was ... Weird? I couldn't figure out what it was. Here's the basic deal: a bunch of tree-huggers hang out with some guy who likes to swim and dance, then they decide not to hang out with him because they became disillusioned, then ten years later they are upset because they spent their youth hugging trees. It's like watching someone's old family vacation video, while they talk to you about how mean their parents were. Go to therapy. Leave me out of it.&nbsp;</fullReview>

		<fullReview>...though one has to admit, this guy was really strange from the git in ways Hubbard, Erhard, Silva, et al weren't (as much, anyway) during their own days as Hollywood's cult leading men. The dynamics are -- as is relatively well, but far from completely, demonstrated in the film -- pretty much always manipulations of the inherent low self-esteem, defense mechanisms (including compensatory competence- seeking), codependence, et al in the psyches of the "true believers."Look up an article called "Codependence as Soft-Core Cult Dynamics... and Vice-Versa" on the Pairadocks blog at Blogspot for a thorough rundown. Or click on http://pairadocks.blogspot.com/2016/08/understanding-co-dependence- as-soft.html if it works here; I dunno.) But, yes, I do agree with one of the thread starters who suggested that all the documentaries about these characters are similar. One wonders if it's because the gurus themselves are essentially similar (as that blog article suggests) or if one of the cults (that is =very= well established in Hollywood) is continuing to do battle with the "competition."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Greetings again from the darkness. David Koresh and the Branch Davidians. Marshall Applewhite and Heaven's Gate. Jim Jones and People's Temple. Charles Manson and The Manson Family. For most of us, this list just about sums up our insight into the world of cults ? and the horrific and violent endings of each are probably the only reason we know as much as we do. Filmmaker Will Allen, and his library of archival footage spanning more than 25 years, takes us behind the scenes of The Buddahfield, a cult run by an exceedingly odd man named Michel Rostand ? or Jaime Gomez ? or Andreas ? or Reyji ? depending on what time period and location we are discussing.The film begins in 1985 West Hollywood as Mr. Allen joins his sister in her search for enlightenment and spiritual awakening. "Why am I here?" he asks ... not referring to the commune of young men and women, but rather why is he on earth ? what is the meaning of life? We have all wondered if it's simply life and death, or if there is a greater purpose. These unanswered questions are how massive churches are built ? and how cults are formed. The early film footage reveals exactly what one would expect: young people frolicking in the type of freedom that comes from dropping out of society. It's an innocence that is ripe for plucking, and that's exactly what "The Teacher" Michel does.Trained as a hypnotherapist, Michel is the guru who claims to possess "the Knowing" ? true enlightenment and the path to God in the purest form. At this point, I should mention that Michel is seemingly always strutting around in a Speedo and Ray-Bans. If he is a man of the cloth, it's an awfully small swatch. He also wears heavy eye-liner and strikes many pensive poses for the camera and his followers.The last thing that I want to do is judge these followers on decisions they made early in life. Feeling lost or emotionally empty and aimless can lead to desperation. In filmmaker Will Allen's defense, this documentary acts as personal therapy or even catharsis for his fellow cult members who judge themselves harshly for the two decades of belief in a cause and a man that ultimately proved to be something much less than spiritual. Many of these followers are interviewed on camera and are clearly struggling even years after leaving the cult. It's not just the awareness of so many wasted years, but also the guilt in following a man who was not merely odd, but who also victimized so many.Creepiness plays a big part here. It's creepy how one guy can so influence the lives of so many others. It's creepy how no one was able to expose this fraud before so many were hurt. It's creepy to hear these folks talk about their mindset during that time. And mostly it's creepy to view the incredible footage shot by Mr. Allen during his two decades on the inside. Lastly, the stalking (with camera) in 2012 which allows Mr. Allen to get the ending for his movie is in itself a special form of creepy ? one that had me thinking that ALL of these people need psychological help.If you want to see the internal workings of a cult (from California to Texas to Hawaii) ? one with Speedos, plastic surgery, ballet, brainwashing, two kinds of peacocks ? and the subsequent fallout, then you'll agree the film delivers a type of eavesdropping and peeking that is both rare and fascinating ? in a creepy kind of way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My first review on IMDb, because I'm bored.....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched roughly 3/4 of this thing last night, don't really know why. However, I found it interesting enough to come here and (for the first time) write a review....Three thoughts came to mind, almost immediately, and continued through the time I shut it off.(1) Isn't it obvious that Mr. Gomez is a homosexual and is trolling for men? Seriously, he runs around in a bikini, oils himself up, talks with a lisp, wears makeup, and loves ballet. Not that there's anything wrong with being gay, but the cult members act like his whole theology was about self enlightenment and denial of sex to achieve a higher level of understanding of one's being and purpose. Sorry, it's pretty obvious that he just wanted dudes.(2) Where are they getting their money from? It's not as if they are living in tents in the woods. Gomez walks around like a millionaire, clearly has no income, does whatever he wants, lives in mansion(s), has a ballet theater constructed (and apparently he tore it down a few times before it was finalized), produced these opulent theatrical performances for themselves only, and was able to sustain this for 30 years. Were they robbing banks dressed as former presidents? (3) How dumb are the women who agreed to join this group? Seriously, Gomez has told all of the men not to have sex, ever. And he's clearly a homosexual. Why would you want to be involved here? I guess I can understand more (and that's not saying much) why a gay guy might want to hang around this group, but what about this was attractive to women? And you have to wonder what purpose Gomez believes women served in his whole plan. Sources of income? A means to attract men? Workers? It sure wasn't for his own pleasure.Now, as far as the film goes, this group was obviously a cult, although the religious part was well defined. The insider view was mildly interesting, and the interviews of former members were informative. However, it breaks no new ground. Most of the footage looks like it was taken from a home video camera, but hey, it's a documentary. It's fairly obvious that it took a bunch of really strange people to follow this supremely strange man, and that much of it was voluntary. So there was a high level of complicity in it. I guess when you have a country with 300+ million people, there's going to be a few thousand that are outliers. But my cousin's golden retriever has more sense than some of these "brainwashed" victims.Felt sorry for some of parents interviewed, but hey they may share some of the blame for letting their own children "find" themselves. I guess you can't control you kids once they become adults, but you sure as hell can do everything in your power to provide them with a moral base while they are children. Still, I guess this can be the end result for a very, very small and frankly, stupid, portion of society. But the film doesn't seem to focus on the bare stupidity element, and instead attempts to make the audience understand why these people were drawn to Gomez. Can't be surprised, considering that the film was produced by a former member who desperately wants people to understand why he was such a weirdo for so long. However, the only thing a reasonably intelligent person would have done was roll around on the ground and laugh hysterically when they first same this guy's act, then get up and run away. So the exact opposite is achieved-- complete lack of understanding and sympathy. Gomez was scum, but the members don't get off the hook for condoning his act, and if anything should be apologizing to each other.Bottom line is that this was more suited for a discovery channel one hour "inside a cult" special than a release as a documentary film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cult by any name is still a cult.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Documentaries tend to be talkie. They usually have a narration and talking heads giving information. Here's a documentary that follows the requisite. It's the story of a cult from West Hollywood. Big surprise you know what the dark secret is going to be from the get go.The film maker uses mostly video footage that does not blow up well for the big screen. It is hard to watch. The documentary is way too long with plenty of redundant talking heads telling basically the same story. The good news is the newest talking head footage is sharp and in focus.It is always good news when a documentary gets a theatrical release. Unfortunately this one will do nothing to get more into theaters. It is in very limited release and not worth seeking out. A CNN credit makes it likely for the cable platform in the near future.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Documentary Makes A Case Against Itself</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just watched the CNN premiere presentation of this documentary and I'm baffled that it signed onto this. A more daring and interesting tale from CNN would have been about the cult of Roger Ailes and Fox News. I give the documentary one star for utterly failing to achieve what I sense was its purpose, to establish that a cult existed and that the leader of the cult was a demon. I give the documentary ten stars for allowing us a glimpse of people who chose to enroll in a community, stayed there for a very long time with pleasure (over 20 years!), then voyaged to a different aspect of life as we all do, but look backward in time at themselves with ridicule. They've concluded that, once upon a time, they were weird. But rather than doing the hard work of examining themselves, they blame the community's leader for their own, long-running, rather voluntary choices. They come across as feeble, as we all can be, and foolish, as we all can be, but they come across as particularly feeble and foolish. They don't seem to have emerged out of that state yet. They do nothing to expose the leader of the community as much as they expose themselves. The documentary is about them, not him, and in that way, a triumph. No one seemed forced to be part of the community. Again and again, you get the impression, as one former community member said, that the great outweighed the bad for everyone. I suppose that's the tale of life for everyone (with exceptions). The documentary is also about the ugliness of betrayal. Once people were with this guy who led the community, then they turned against him, but instead of moving on to greener pastures in quiet dignity, they exhibit an ugliness of spirit, even being coarse and vulgar at times, certainly more so than the leader as we get to know him in the documentary. Maybe the leader is an evil guy, maybe he is, as the documentary's title suggests, the leader of Holy Hell, but not by the accounts of the documentary.I think Dan Gillespie, in the March 10, 2016 review below, captured things perfectly when he said: "Here's the basic deal: a bunch of tree-huggers hang out with some guy who likes to swim and dance, then they decide not to hang out with him because they became disillusioned, then ten years later they are upset because they spent their youth hugging trees."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"He said/she said" that doesn't strike true</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went to Holy Hell thinking it was about Amma, like the book. Instead I got a similar story, just with different characters. This film, is about a community in the 80's and 90's that seemed to be seeking something deeper, and had followers that appeared to be living in an American version of an ashram, spending their time around a teacher who challenged them. Not unlike my experience with Amma. I read excerpts from the Holy Hell book when it came out: how the writer was at first enthralled by her, then the accusations fly, and suddenly she is vilified. Having spent time in her company on several occasions, I found these accusations ridiculous and unbelievable. And watching this film, I felt more authenticity from the storytellers when they were sharing about the love they felt, or the service they did, or the lessons taught. When the energy of the film took a sharp turn to "he said/she said" it doesn't strike true. One minute this guy is in tears remembering the beauty of preparing fruit for his teacher and the next minute he's complaining that he had to make a fruit plate. Then come the accusations of inappropriate sexual dealings. If these accusations were real, wouldn't this teacher be behind bars? So I look at this film with cautious eyes, because I have lived through something similar and saw how easy it was to adopt someone else's story and take it for truth. And that's the really scary thing about storytelling: if you hear something often enough the brain assumes it's real.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Holy Hell - A Cliché Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Holy Hell is a movie that attempts to show what life inside a cult is really like. The movie starts out interesting for sure. The archival footage is engaging and some of it seems very beautiful for the people participating.However, at some point in the movie the whole plot devolves into the cliché "cult propganda" buzzwords we hear so much about in Hollywood. Brainwashing, sexual perversion, etc...I saw this film at Sundance because the news articles about it discussed how many of the former members came forward to tell their experience. Unfortunately in the film what I saw were a close group of friends who all had the same story. When I watch a documentary I expect to see all the points of view that culminate in me, the viewer, being allowed to reach my own decision. Instead what I saw was a carefully constructed narrative to lead the viewer to a specific conclusion. By the end of the film I felt like I was having Will Allen's point of view thrown at me, without any exploration of the supposed 100s of other people involved.In short, the film trades in it's initial joy and wonder for a run of the mill "this guy made me do it" cult story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It was interesting to see a spiritual community from the inside but there are some issues with this amateur documentary. Over all it has a complete lack of structure and a simplistic approach that leave the viewer wanting. I wouldn't call this project healing so much as hubris. Will Allen and cast seem to be doing their best to convince us of their victim hood but I found it hard to sympathize with their tenuous case against their "guru," especially when they skirt the issue of proof. Will seemed a little too heart-felt if you know what I mean and the cast seemed like a cult of its own.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've read some of the reviews on here and all I have to say is, come on. Let's not be so gullible as to think we're being shown an authentic take on what was happening within the Buddhafield. Yeah, some of the scenes and faces look accurate, but the narrative and the creepy music skew the footage, and the mood of what was happening. What we're watching is what Will Allen wants us to see, not what the actual Buddhafield was like.I say this because a large part of what this movie relies on is the appeal of insider footage of a cult. Take away the supposition that we're watching true, unadulterated clips, and what we get is a skewed story about some unusual people.Also no one is pausing to ask the important question - who is the real "bad guy?" What if everyone was at fault, or maybe no one? Blaming the teacher seems logical but by the end of the movie I was disappointed that Will Allen took the most obvious victim approach. The film could have dove into some deep reflection and questioning but instead it left me wanting a more dispassionate analysis of what was truly happening.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Reading some of the comments by others who have reviewed this film here, I find it almost unbelievable that they actually sat through the entire movieThis is a heart-wrenching document of a man's life for over two decades, filmed as it was happening and illuminated by the voiced narration provided by himself and many of the friends that went through these experiences with him. They all put their trust and faith in a charismatic man who hid behind spiritual truth while manipulating them for years into supporting him- indeed, into worshiping him- and, in many cases, into being his sexual playthings. The colossal betrayal of trust described here is beyond comprehension for most of us, and bravo to the filmmaker- and to his fellow former victims of this narcissistic charlatan- for having the courage to tell the story. Not only will it hopefully help to put a stop to their former guru's continued transgressions (yes, he's still at it), maybe it will also help to open people's eyes to the kind of hypocrisy and predatory behavior that such men practice in alarming numbers within our culture, right under our very noses.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting but definitely suspicious</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Holy Hell is an interesting premise that falls flat for a few reasons. First and foremost, the movie blends fact and opinion so thoroughly that it is impossible to tell them apart and therefore impossible for me to take it very seriously.As a number of reviews on here have mentioned, the film leaves us with a definite creepy feeling. Yet interestingly I didn't really find the footage actually creepy. Maybe strange, and at many points I would have liked an explanation of what was happening. Why were they in the forest shaking etc... (don't want to give too many spoilers). The creepiness was definitely due to the narration and not the footage.And this is where, for me, the film breaks down - the narration. Yes a number of cast members come forward to talk about the control, narcissism and manipulation that was happening "under their very noses", but what they say seems to have a number of inconsistencies.The problem that stuck out for me the most was that according to this documentary, Michel, the narcissistic leader, spends over 20 years with these people, has hundreds of followers, and out of all that time and effort he gets to sleep with a few of them. I mean first off rampant gay sex and bisexual exploration in the 80's isn't surprising so I'm wondering why there wasn't MORE sex, but also 20 years of work for a few sexual encounters (not even one a year according to the film)? That seems like a lot of work for very little sex. I mean either Michel is the worst manipulator in history, or things are being blown out of proportion, either way it makes the claims in this seem way less serious.Which brings us to the second question, why did so many people stay? They attempt to answer this, that they didn't want to lose their friends, etc... but then they all end up leaving anyway and not talking for 10 years. So I suspect that the reason they stayed is much more complex, as it always is with matters of the heart and spiritual things.All and all the footage in it is fascinating but I would rather they just eliminated the talking heads spinning a story and really explain what was happening, with all of its various nuances.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A great movie to make you question just who we give our power to in our daily lives, on a spiritual path or not.Unlike a good number of the reviewers posted here, I actually saw the movie twice at Sundance. Beware, the movie never premiered in Minneapolis as mentioned in a review or two. Most of the reviews, and all of the negative ones are from current members of the cult. Let that show you something about this movie and why it is so relevant and important!This is a captivating story with depth, where the director takes you along for the ride- his perspective while spending 20 years in this spiritual community turned cult. The talking head interviews from many of the cast members who were also group members allow you to understand why everyone was initially there in this community, something most cult movies never show.And, the movie quite easily captures their confusion and disbelief when their idyllic world collapsed around them. Suddenly it was a classic CULT with a narcissistic leader, almost straight from the book and it is painful in moments, to listen their disillusionment and suffering, sometimes still a bit woven into their current lives. We feel with them.A must see for anyone on a spiritual path as it is a tricky slope to do the work, surrender all that is not Awareness, yet not surrender your will to some one elses' personal agenda.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My least favorite documentary at MFF</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After watching Will Allens interviews I was interested in seeing the documentary. I'm a filmmaker myself but to me this doc didn't hit the mark. It was carefully edited to make a biased point. I'm always wary of documentaries like this because I know how easy it is to take things out of context to manipulate and edit footage in whatever way you want. It's all a matter of perspective. All it takes is a little editing and you can make kittens look like tigers. This felt more like a ploy to jump start Wills film career than an honest documentary. The interviews seemed rehearsed and the cast seemed more like bad actors than testimonials. As far as the guy that claims he was sexually forced, I have a hard time believing that story. For all those years? And don't give me the "brainwashed" excuse. That's what people say when they don't want to be held accountable for their actions. This stuff happens but there's no need to make a whole documentary about it. My sister was in a community regarded as a "cult" for many years. Eventually she left without any trouble from the community. She's still friends with many of them. She told stories about the dramatic ones who turned against the community and created a lot of trouble because they needed sympathy and attention. It sounds a lot like my ex-girlfriend. People will exploit interpersonal relationships just to fulfill a desire to be important. Will Allen claims that he wants to heal. There is a saying, if you want to heal a wound don't pick at it. I don't see an attempt to heal here I just see a personal vendetta. When I left the theater my friends and I felt manipulated and down. I saw several documentaries at the festival and this was by far my least favorite.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Disappointing Documentary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is my first time reviewing, but I feel compelled to write about this subject as it is near and dear to me. Here goes:I saw this documentary at the Minneapolis St. Paul film festival and found it very much of a letdown. I was hoping to see a fresh, insightful approach to this topic of cults in the US but instead I saw a tired reiteration of the same old story of people blaming a "charismatic" leader for the letdowns in their life. The film started out charmingly but quickly went downhill. The narrative and interviews deteriorated into cult and guru bashing with nothing offered in the way of alternate points of view. With the way this film was billed I thought it would bring insight about human nature and spirituality, but instead if felt more like an embarrassingly close up view into a support group for washed up hippies. Nothing against hippies.I have been with many spiritual teachers, the most notable being Ammaji. This theme of inspiration and eventual disillusionment can be seen across the board in any type of spiritual community but I was surprised to see the immature, narrow-minded approach taken by the ex-disciples in this film. Films like this give spirituality a bad name in the United States.All in all, even if you are interested in this subject I would steer clear of this somewhat dull and disappointing documentary.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Holy Hell reads like a film written by Donald Trump's speech writers. The protagonists says whatever words are popular to try and get the viewer to believe their story. It is scary an unconscious movie can be made like this in 2016. It should called Holy Excrement. It was a waste of my time and fried my eyes like Donald Trump's presidential campaign. Clearly, there is a thinly veiled agenda to single out a group in this film. Movies like these were made before WWII to target a group of people for extermination. If I could give a zero rating, it would be too high. Don't waste your time. It rate five wipes and a flush. On the upside, if you ever need hairstyle ideas for a 1980's disco party, the footage in this film is priceless.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wanted to feel sorry for the people in this film, and it was clear from the editing that that was their intent, but I just couldn't. They entered into their community, made choices and then complained about their own choices. I have known many actual victims of rape and many victims of domestic abuse whereby the victim was literally trapped in horrific situations. This is not what seemed to be happening to these people. It seems they entered into sexual relations and then got upset because they weren't unique. Where was their angst prior to realizing the "teacher" had multiple partners over the decades in question? Is this a case of nasty divorce... "Looking back he was always an asshole" ?? Because the footage, although super hippy dippy, seems to reveal a bunch of happy people. And even the cast seems more convincing about what was, when they were in the throes of 'bliss', compared to the memory of the supposed 'holy hell.' And isn't a documentary supposed to have at least the appearance of neutrality? Where are the interviews of people who left and had no complaints? Or of the people who stayed?&nbsp;</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very interesting film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this film at Sundance and was impressed with the story and the large amount of footage. The film maker was a member of the cult and was responsible for filming within the cult so the quality of the footage is impressive.I really enjoyed the film, and recommend it highly. The film does a good job of showing how intelligent people are not at all immune from being taken in by cults, and what they get out of membership.The extremely negative reviews here from new accounts just adds a nice angle to the film. The cult leader portrayed in the film is still in operation. Fascinating world few of us get a close look at.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A look from the inside</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Holy Hell stands out from other documentaries about cults in that a primary member of the religion is the one telling the story. So it's a film presented from the inside instead of someone on the outside trying to pry his or her way into this world. So instead of just seeing how the church was founded, you follow the filmmakers journey in and inevitably out of the cult. So you understand the appeal of the church, the connection the filmmaker felt to other members, and you feel betrayed and hurt by the actions of the cult's founder and figurehead.It makes me sad to see others review this film and say that it's leading you on to feel a certain thing, or to hear the way other reviewers treat victims. The film isn't trying to tell you how to feel, it tells you how many of its members feel. It works best not just as a condemnation of the Buddhafield or even religion, but as a critique of blindly following any ideology or organization without objectively figuring out what that organization stands for.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched Holy Hell at Hot Docs in Toronto last night...bizarre and surreal for sure. In reading the other negative reviews just now, I'm not surprised by the lack of empathy for the filmmaker (Will Allen) - he tackled a very thorny subject. In a perfect world he could have shown both sides of the story including interviews with current members and well as the 'guru' himself. Let's be clear, this is a personal journey documentary, one that encompasses over two decades of Wills' life. Cut him some slack. The archival video footage alone gives such a strong glimpse into the world he inhabited for not just for a weekend retreat, but for many years of his life. While it seemed that everyone involved was there on their own free will, the larger issue remains equally clear - they were under the influence of a very charismatic spiritual predator. It is a cautionary tale for anyone seeking guidance through the sticky realm of enlightenment.Kudos to Will for the strength it took to revisit his past (both pleasant and painful) and his attempt to expose a fraud (somewhat unsuccessfully) who was such a powerful force from his young adult years to the very recent past. A question I regret not asking Will during the Q&amp;A is how it's never addressed if any ex-member is pursuing legal action against the leader? My guess is the 'free will' aspect puts their complaint under too much scrutiny.</fullReview>
