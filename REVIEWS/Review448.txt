		<fullReview>Mission - To assassinate a top ranking Nazi Officer, Reinhard Heydrich. Not many films leave me feeling this much emotion.. so much so, I felt the need to write my 2nd review in around 5 years! I thought the casting was an interesting choice and Cillian Murphy and Jamie Dornan didn't disappoint but I really loved Anna Geislerova. Although most of the action is towards the end of the film, the lead up to the events gave a good insight to the characters which I find some films lack as they are too busy concentrating on special effects, rather than getting to know the characters. . I found myself holding my breath on many occasions! A truly gripping finale and I will definitely be watching this again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the last stand</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Greetings again from the darkness. It's been more than 70 years since the Second World War ended, and it's still producing fascinating stories, books, and movies. Director Sean Ellis co-wrote the script with Anthony Frewin after tireless research into a secret mission of the Czech resistance known as Operation Anthropoid. The purpose was to assassinate SS General Reinhard Heydrich, third in command of The Reich behind only Hitler and Himmler.Hitler invaded Poland the year after taking Czechoslovakia and put Heydrich in charge. In addition to being the main architect behind the Final Solution, Heydrich became known as "The Butcher of Prague" as thousands of citizens were slain under his reign of terror.The story is split into two distinct parts ? the buildup and the aftermath. It's late 1941 when we see Jan Kubis (Jamie Dornan) and Josef Gabcik (Cillian Murphy) parachute into the territory outside of Prague and make their way to the city only to discover their contact has been killed. Over the next few months, the two soldiers spend time planning, observing and blending in, while living with their host family ? the Moravecs. They become attached to two local ladies (Charlotte Le Bon, Anna Geislorova), first as cover for the mission, and then in a more personal manner as tension builds and the mission gets closer.Many of the original, historic and actual locations are used which adds an element of realism to a story that's already plenty real and emotional. The second half of the story is what happens after the assassination. Seven of the original parachutists go into hiding in the basement of the Saints Cyril and Methodius Cathedral. The manhunt is brutal and extensive, and once the hideout is discovered, a seemingly unending parade of German soldiers and ever-increasing weaponry are unleashed. It's a beautifully filmed, but gut-wrenching scene ? think of the last stand at The Alamo.An extended shootout (6 hours in real time) may not seem like a fun day at the movies, but this story goes to the bravery and desperation of those who refused to give in to the relentless savagery of the Germans. In addition to Ms. Le Bon and Ms. Geislorova, Czech screen vet Alena Mihulova is another standout here. The pacing of the story telling is a bit off at times, but director Ellis brings historical accuracy to a fascinating story in ways that movies such as Valkyrie and Inglourious Basterds didn't even attempt. As courageous as those in the resistance were, the aftermath and reprisals do beg the question ? was it worth the price? Not an easy question to answer even in hindsight.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Tough Film I'm Glad I Saw</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My mother was born in Slovakia and I grew up on stories. How beautiful her village was, of course. But stories of overwhelming ugliness, too. Munich, like Yalta, was an obscene word in our household. In 1938, long after Hitler had revealed that he was a rabid dog needing to be put down, the West surrendered Czechoslovakia to Hitler without firing one bullet. British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain, the man with an umbrella, called the Munich agreement "peace for our time." One of the many reasons so few Eastern Europeans are Anglophiles. My mother taught me about Lidice, a Czech village that, with its inhabitants, had been wiped off the face of the earth by the Nazis. The men shot, the women and children murdered more slowly, the houses razed to the ground. In fact the Nazis wiped out hundreds of villages in Poland and Czechoslovakia. "Anthropoid" is a Hollywood movie that, at long last, tells some of the war from the point of view of desperate Czechs and Slovaks fighting the Nazis. Fanboys gripe, "How many World War II movies can you make?" One answer: chronicling of World War II will not be complete as long as major stories like Operation Anthropoid remain untold. Reinhard Heydrich was one of the worst human beings who ever lived. He chaired the Wannsee Conference that formalized the Final Solution, the Nazi plan to murder all Jews. He was also in charge of the Czech Republic. He brutalized the population and wiped out the resistance in short order. Heydrich was the only top Nazi to be assassinated, although there were assassination plots against others, significantly Hitler himself. People need to know that non-Jews, as well as Jews, suffered under the Nazis. People need to know of the incredible courage and heroism of forgotten heroes who fought the Nazis. The questions of an operation like Anthropoid remain open. Is it ethical, and is it militarily strategic, to assassinate one of history's worst humans if you know that thousands of innocent people will be murdered in retaliation? "Anthropoid" opens with two resistance fighers, Jan Kubis a Czech (Jamie Dornan) and Jozef Gabcik, a Slovak (Cillian Murphy), being parachuted into Czechoslovakia after their training in England. They must find the tiny remnants of the surviving underground and announce their assassination plan. Resistance members Ladislav Vanek (Marcin Dorocinski) and Uncle Hajsky (Toby Jones) are not immediately enthusiastic. They recognize the risks of retaliatory mass killings. They understand that this assassination may be more of a means of bringing respect to the Czechoslovak government in exile in London under Edvard Benes. "Anthropoid" is a tense, gripping, film noir-ish film. I was on the edge of my seat the entire time, and I cried at the end. For hours afterward I was haunted by the film. It's not for nothing that Steven Spielberg chose to make a glamorous, powerful, heroic, high-living member of the Nazi party the subject of his "Schindler's List." It's hard for a storyteller to tell the audience a story that has no triumphant moments, lots of death, and an ending that most filmgoers will already know. "Anthropoid" consists largely of very tight shots on the faces of its two assassins as they live in Nazi-occupied Prague, trying to figure out a way to fulfill their mission. Scenes are dimly lit. Everyone is tense. There is little laughter or smiling. There is zero swaggering. There is a very brief moment toward the end that offers a hint of redemption. If you see the film, you will know what I'm talking about. The scene involves water, light, and a beautiful woman reaching out her hand. The film does not take in the grand sweep of history. There are no shots of London headquarters, no fetishizing of squeaky Nazi boots or Hugo Boss uniforms. Lidice is mentioned in such an understated manner that filmgoers unfamiliar with it won't know what has been said. "Anthropoid" offers an almost documentary look at what it is to be an assassin in a totalitarian regime. It's not fun. I was at first dubious when I heard that Cillian Murphy would be playing Jozef Gabcik. I wished for a Slovak actor. Murphy's performance is the emotional and aesthetic heart of the film. Murphy rarely allows any emotion to register on his face. He has turned himself into a killing machine. When, at a certain moment, a tear falls from his eye, that tear carries great weight. The audience knows what a courageous professional this man is.My mother told me about Jan Kubis and Jozef Gabcik. When I have gone through tough times in my own life, I have used men like them to inspire me. How can I complain, when they went through so much worse? How can I give up, when they never did, through a six-hour shootout with Nazis who massively outgunned and outmanned them? How can I fail to take risks to fight evil, when a Slovak just like me managed to send to hell a man who seems to have emerged from its most fetid depths? "Anthropoid" is not a fun movie, but I'm glad I saw it. It brings me closer to the heroes it honors.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Assassination of Reinhard Heydrich May 1942</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Around 1969 I read a book called "Seven Men At Daybreak" by Allen Burgess. It was book about Operation ANTHROPOID. This movie follows that book in nearly a mirror image. Being a World War II history buff, I felt it was an amazing film to watch. It follows a group of Czech soldiers who have returned home after escaping to England as their country was given away to Germany by the Munich Agreement. Jan Kubis and Josef Gabchik have been handed the task of assassinating Reinhard Heydrich, who is running the Czech occupation with an iron fist. The assassination plan is not popular with the underground because they are dreadfully afraid of retaliation by the Nazis. This proves to be a justifiable fear. After the deed is done there is a terrible backlash against the country. As the few remaining underground members try to develop a plan to smuggle the seven parachutists out of Praque, they are betrayed by an informer. The resulting shootout pitted the seven men, in two relays fighting an entire regiment of 750 crack SS troops. It lasted six hours. After the assassination, siege and reprisals, the final outcome was the voiding of the Munich Agreement by Winston Churchill. The bullet scars are still in evidence in the walls of the Church of Saints Cyril and Methodius in Prague. Hoping the movie is not overlooked at Oscar nomination time. It is beautifully photographed and historically accurate. The tension of the assassination and siege will have you on the edge of your seat.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tale of Immense Bravery and Daring - Fabulous!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Czech resistance operatives depicted in "Anthropoid" show what it takes to go all out to fight back against absolute tyranny. This film is a must for those interested in WWII in Nazi-occupied countries. A David and Goliath story where the Phillistines don't just walk away but mercilessly take retribution. Cillian Murphy gives his usual lean and hungry performance as a man on a mission that has priority over everything else including his own life and those of others. There was no half-way resistance here, either you were in to the max or completely out. Even though Czechs were sold out at Munich in 1938 and completely under the Nazi thumb, they did kill the highest ranking Nazi during the War. The sets are very real and take you there. "Anthropoid" is an inspirational and invigorating film!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Of late, I have been fortunate to watch quite a few screenings and new releases. Most have been disappointing and I would not recommend anyone pay money to see them. Some were so bad I would not recommend anyone waste their time if/when it comes out for free on cable. While I have not reviewed any of those (yet), I wanted to give a massive shout out to Anthropoid. It was absolutely fantastic. Very well done. A historical piece based on actual events. An eye opening account of what went on in Czechoslovakia during the period of Nazi rule. Cillian Murphy and Jamie Dornan were superb! Highly recommend seeing it in theatres.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Antedote to overblown special effects films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After months of slogging through big-budget, special effects studio films that were just "fine" all summer, I've finally encountered a hidden gem that is well worth watching.ANTHROPOID is a World War II film starring Cillian Murphy that tells the true tale of a group of Czech resistance fighters on a mission (Codenamed ANTHROPOID) to assassinate Nazi SS General Reinhard Heydrich, the "Butcher of Prague". Director and writer Sean Ellis (The Proposal) really breaks through in this taught thriller that is part drama, part thriller and part action movie. Ellis creates a group of real people (the drama part of the film) with real relationships operating undercover in a very dangerous situation (the thriller part) in order to carry out orders to assassinate the #3 in command of the German hierarchy (the action part).Some will find the first hour of the movie a bit slow as Ellis builds up his characters and their relationships. This turns out to be an important slow burn build-up and really pays off as the action starts heating up the screen and you are really invested in what happens to these people.The acting is top-notch starting with Murphy, who I looked at in this movie and wondered why he isn't a bigger star. As Mission Leader Josef Gabcik, he is strongly focused on the mission only to find out the real human consequences of his actions along the way. He is ably assisted by Jamie Dornan (who proves there is a real actor underneath the 50 Shades of Gray) as his partner who needs to find the courage to go through with the mission and the always reliable Toby Jones as the head of the Czech underground. These 3 known (at least to me) stars are joined by strong European actors/actresses, most notably Marcin Dorocinski (as a reluctant Resistance fighter), Alena Mihulava (as the woman who hides the resistance fighters), and Harry Lloyd (the ranking Czech officer). Most impressive to me is the work of Czech actress Anna Geislerova (as another resistance fighter). I could not take my eyes off of her when she was on the screen, so had to look her up. She has over 100 credits, none of which is widely known to US audiences (mostly Czech films). I would love to see her do other things.The acting is good, the script/drama is tight and the action (once it is started) is terrific, showing just enough that you know where everyone is in relation to the others, what they are doing and what peril they are in. Director Ellis avoids going "overboard" and the action is all the better for it. The big studios could learn a thing or two about "less is more" from this film. I really enjoyed this one - it was a welcome break from the onslaught of special effects that has become the norm in the summer - and I STRONGLY recommend it to you.A strong 8 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank (of Marquis)</fullReview>

If you haven't watched it you must see it. Thank you to all the actors for trying to show us how it was in that time and how the people suffered during world war II. I think that we need to know more about the hero's that tried to help others and the actors showed us that. I cried at the end it is truly an emotional and very moving movie. It was really intense at some points in the movie I jumped out of my seat, but in all the actors stayed true to what was going on at the time. I salute the actors for their hard work and professionalism in making this movie a truly great movie!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Anthropoid is powerful, sobering and deeply affecting filmmaking...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Dramatising the events of Operation Anthropoid offers a rich and gripping story to explore and its a surprise it hasn't been looked at much before, save for a few smaller films focusing on different aspects of the mission. Whilst its evident from the style and genre choices that this is a film set in the past, with wartime and Nazi iconography immediately setting the tone, Ellis seeks to reflect themes that many will recognise in a society that occasionally feels too eerily similar to the events of the film, if not directly in westernised cities and countries, than in the media. Disloyalty, family, friends, loss, paranoia, strength, patriotism and truth are each explored in their own subtle way throughout the film, offering moral complex thoughts and notions throughout the film. One scene, in which a young lad is tortured before being reminded of his mother is blood-curdling and absolutely shocking, but never beyond that we can imagine as horror stories from similar areas devastated by war and extremism. In silence, the words at the end of the film are displayed with audible gasps from the audience, and while this is dramatised from our past, the moment is stops deeply affecting is the moment we have lost touch with our pasts, and stopped learning from mistakes."Read my full review here - http://perksofbeingnath.blogspot.com/2016/08/anthropoid-2016- review.html</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Intelligent and Disturbing Take on a WWII Resistance Operation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Its title makes this film sound like a monster thriller, and so it is, but not in the expected way. This is a violent, harrowing film about a real incident in WWII, and by the end you'll feel weak-legged and drained. But it's also a very fine film that gives real insight into the horrors of the Nazi occupation of central Europe and the difficulties of resisting it. Though there are plenty of bad guys here, there are no purely good ones. We are reminded that Czechoslovakia was handed over by the allies to Hitler to appease him, entirely in vain. Under the Nazi jackboot not even close family can be trusted to keep secrets. We see acts of extraordinary bravery while continually questioning whether the price for those acts was too high. Two expatriates have been parachuted secretly into their homeland tasked by their government-in-exile to assassinate Reinhard Heydrich, Hitler's third-in-command and the monster overseeing the brutal repression of Czechoslovakia. Meeting what is left of the local resistance in Prague, they expect a hero's welcome. Instead they find themselves caught up in violent arguments about whether their mission, Operation Anthropoid, won't lead to worse atrocities. The narrative includes many hand-held shots with facial close-ups, giving it an immediate, documentary intensity. The colour footage has a washed- out quality that gives a 1940s feel, and the Prague location shots are totally convincing. Even the obligatory romances are fully and plausibly incorporated into the main narrative. The acting is universally excellent: if you didn't know these actors, you'd swear they were all Czechoslovaks. Warning: the dialogue is all in heavily accented English, so it can be sometimes be difficult to hear. But it's never difficult to figure out the intended meaning. This is a film in which actions speak louder than words.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although I have checked the "spoiler alert" box, I will do my best to avoid details of this superb movie.I gave it a "9" because it takes a great stride for me to give anything a 10. Sorry, but that is the way I am.The two lead male actors are dashingly handsome, each in his own distinct way. Their camaraderie is powerful and palpable -- especially to those of us who have served in any of our U.S. Military branches.The tangible brutality of the Nazis is riveting. One is compelled to question over and again how any group of humans (subhumans in this instance) could be so barbaric and destructive of human life. There is a moral lesson in "Anthropoid", one that may get past many.I will leave the rest to future viewers. If you are one who is indeed interested in the monsters of WWII, it is worth a trip to the cinema to watch!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The pay-off comes in the second half of the movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Anthropoid" (2016 release from Czech Republic; 120 min.) brings the story, "based on true events" we are reminded at the beginning of the movie, of the attempt by Czech resistance fighters to assassinate Reinhard Heydrich, the No. 3 guy in the Nazi hierarchy (behind Hitler and Himmler) and better known as the "Butcher of Prague". This mission was code-named "Project Anthropoid". As the movie opens, we see two guys parachute down outside of Prague. When they get to Prague, their local contact person is missing, but eventually they are led to other resistance fighters. To tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is directed by British director Sean Ellis, who also co-wrote the script. The plot takes quite a while to gel, so to speak. More annoyingly, there are way too many hand-held camera shots and/or extreme close-ups for no particular reason other than to give you a headache. All is forgiven, though, in the riveting last 35-40 min. of the movie (biting my tongue--mustn't say more!). The ensemble cast are, other than Toby Jones, all unknowns, at least in the US. The film benefits enormously from having been shot in Prague itself, with the Prague Castle and Charles Bridge featured prominently, and check out also the authentic trams from those days. After the movie's conclusion, we are told what happened in the aftermath of these events. While the movie isn't the best WWII movie, neither is it the worst. "Anthropoid" recently opened at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati. The Sunday early evening screening where I saw this at was attended nicely, and leaning heavily towards seniors I might add. If you are in the mood for a WWII movie, realizing that not much happens in the first hour of the movie, "Anthropoid" is worth checking out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There is no comic relief in "Anthropoid", a grim and harrowing movie about the Czech underground in Prague during WWII. It is extremely well done. So authentic is the narrative and the acting so competent that it ceases to be a movie and becomes real - the suspension of the disbelief we all have when entering a theater is in effect. We can feel the stark motivational distinction between the valor of the doomed freedom fighters and the unfeeling cruelty of the Nazi machine. Adding to the feeling of authenticity is the location filming in the streets of Prague, as well as the costuming and background music of 40's standards.The cast is a good one and the only change I would like to have seen is a different star in the leading role. Heavy lidded and thick-lipped, Cilian Murphy does not have a hero's face and perhaps his role could have been switched with Jamie Dornan. Although most of the action takes place in the last half hour it is still one of the best and most genuine WWII resistance pictures ever produced.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good account of the assassination of Butcher of Prague</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>More than a dozen Nazis were assassinated during the War, no one higher up than Reinhard Heydrich, SS-Obergruppenfuhrer, "the Butcher of Prague" and someone Hitler called "the man with the iron heart". This is the fourth film dealing with this topic. The most famous attempt at assassination, of course, was the 1944 attempt to kill Hitler in his "Wolf's Lair" which has been filmed over a dozen times.(Other notable high ranking Nazis who were assassinated include Christian Wirth aka "Christian the Terrible" who turned the T4 program into the extermination camps, and Franz Karl Reichleitner, the commandant of Sobibor. Perhaps an aspiring film maker will give us a film about these)The film tells the story of the heroic efforts of the Czech people to kill the man who was oppressing them. These types of films are important. They remind us that fighting evil is essential, regardless of the cost, and that evil thrives when cowards refuse to face it. The story is based on the facts, such as they are known given that many of the players died during the action and afterwards. The acting is uniformly excellent as is the photography and the location setting and costumes. It's done so well you feel sometimes that you are actually there.For my tastes the film moves a little slow for the first half, and the ending could have been done better. I also didn't like the fact that most of the abuses of the Nazi prior to the assassination attempt were spoken about but not actually seen.If you like this topic or genre you might enjoy the Czech film "The Assassination" (1965), "Hitler's Manman" (1943), "Operation Daybreak" (1975), "Higher Principle" (1960), "Lidice" (2011), "The Silent Village" (1943), and my favorite "Hangmen Also Die" (1943).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best resistance stories in film history.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Cowards die many times before their deaths; the valiant never taste of death but once." Shakespeare's Julius Caesar If you delight in the fantasy violence of summer blockbusters, you will lose any romantic notions about it when you see the real deal in Anthropoid, a based-on-actual-events biography about seven WWII resistance fighters who parachute into Nazi-held Czechoslovakia. Their job: assassinate the third highest ranking officer of the Reich, Reinhard Heydrich (Detlef Bothe), the Butcher of Prague.As in all dictatorships, never a safe moment exists, and writer-director Sean Ellis, along with writer Anthony Frewin, emphasizes both the bravery of the fighters and the brutality of the Nazis in a quagmire of deceit and fear. No sympathy for any of occupiers but much to admire in the freedom fighters, the best examples of the "valiant" Caesar mentions in the above quote.The two lead fighters, Jan (Jamie Dornan) and Josef (Cillian Murphy), crystallize the film's impressive depiction of understated bravery and humanity: Both take life-threatening chances -- Jan has realistic moments of cowardice and bravery while Josef is steadfast. Both fall in love in mature circumstances that brook little romance.If there are any faults in Anthropoid, one would be the overly-long fight scene in the church hideout. After a few minutes, one can get the idea of the mayhem that lasted in reality about 6 hours. However, this scene certainly shows the valor of the fighters against the relentless Nazi machine.In the end, Anthropoid is the story of heroism crucified by almost unstoppable, and certainly unfathomable, evil. Although we are buoyed up by any resistance victory, that joy is seriously tempered by the triumph of the enemy's will.As the title suggests, subhuman Nazi anthropoids rule the landscape: in one instance, they bring in the severed head of a resistance sympathizer to torture her son. Yet, real loving, hurting humans try to survive the horror. Anthropoid makes Planet of the Apes look like The Sound of Music.After Army of Shadows, Anthropoid ranks as one of the best resistance stories in film history."Satan understands the power of men and women united in righteousness."

		<fullReview>ANTHROPOID is a riveting depiction of one of the most heroic stories in WWII. Excellent performances by #JamieDornan and #CillianMurphy. And the film's final 45 minutes present one of the most intense shootouts that I've ever seen.Written by Sean Ellis and Anthony Frewin and directed by Ellis, I actually came into the screening fresh, meaning I genuinely had no idea what to expect because as much a history buff as I am, this specific section where there was actually a mission to assassinate SS officer Reinhard Heydrich, was one that I may have somehow missed out on from the textbooks. The code name for the mission is Anthropoid. Two soldiers from the Czechoslovakian army-in-exile, Josef Gab&#x10d;ík (Cillian Murphy) and Jan Kubis (Jamie Dornan) parachuted into their occupied homeland in December 1941. With limited intelligence and little equipment in a city under lock down, they must find a way to assassinate the architect behind the Final Solution.This film spends a lot of time humanizing the two leads, the two soldiers, by slapping the story on with some romance, which to me could backfire, because it could mean the difference between Michael Bay's "Pearl Harbor" and Bryan Singer's "Valkyrie" for example. But I totally understand why writer/director Sean Ellis felt the need to include the love interests, because they remind us that the stakes are high. And thankfully, it's not done in a Hollywood manner, the romance does give depth to the two leads who may have second thoughts about committing to the cause, considering the sacrifices ahead. But as soon as the standoff or the shootout happens, as I said earlier, the film's final 45 minutes will give you a battle scene unlike anything you've ever seen. And you definitely forget that Jamie Dornan was that "Fifty Shades Of Grey" man, he brings his acting chops with him to ANTHROPOID and it shows. Yes this is a war movie but it's also a human drama, so deeply affecting that you'll end up researching the history of what really happened, the minute you've arrived home after screening ANTHROPOID.-- Rama's Screen --</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The film actually portrays the details of the actual assassination as it historically unfolded.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Overall, I thought the movie was spot on with regards to the way the actual assassination went down. I thought Mr.Ellis and Mr. Frewin, did a great job in conveying a truly historical moment in history. A moment that meant so much to the people of Czechoslovakia and to the free people of the world at that time. As a matter of storytelling they successfully led the audience to a truly climatic event shown masterfully as the operation really unfolded.I know films based on true facts have a great deal of background and that it is difficult for all connected to a film project such as this are limited in putting the full story into a 2 hour movie. Thus the meat of this story regarding it's title "Anthropoid" was achieved quite successfully. In 2012, I began doing considerable historical research on "Operation Anthropoid". I painstakingly, researched the biographical backgrounds of the three main characters namely REINHARD HEYDRICK, JAN KUBIS and JOZEF GABCIK. Subsequently in April 2014, I completed writing a film treatment titled " THE BLOND BEAST'. It is also based on Operation Anthropoid. However,the concept of my film story begins by paralleling the lives of these three individuals at their teenage years. My story projects Heydrick, shown to be a soul less man who possess an insatiable appetite for power, with an equally ravenous appetite for sex. I depict him as a man built of total evil who orchestrates and then enforces the incomprehensible act of mass genocide.In total contrast to Heydrick, I told the story of both Kubis and Gabcik as wholesome self righteous men of moral fiber who lived by a code of honor and integrity. My story portrays an intriguing account of these two heroic men who steered by destiny become entwined in the most important covert mission during WWII. Prior to their mission they are decorated for their heroic actions while fighting alongside with the French forces against the Nazis, they are recruited by British Intelligence and then trained by Scottish Commandos and then sent along with members of Silver group A on this dangerous mission. The theme of my script simply put "Conveys good conquering evil; but at a costly, very costly price. I wrote the story in the hopes that somebody in Hollywood would have produced it because I believe it would have paid homage to both Jan Kubis and Jozef Gabcik. Thank you, Mr. Ellis and Mr. Frewin. I believe you did just that. I knew this true story would make for a fine film. I only wish, I could have had an opportunity to have been part of this wonderful film project. I believe I would have had something to offer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Operation: Daybreak (1975) Far Better Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I my opinion Operation: Daybreak (1975) is a far better movie than this remake, with a much better atmosphere of the struggle and tense time the people of Prague were experiencing Q... the quality of acting? once again the question arises CAN MR DORNAN ACT ??? The direction has a modern feel but keeps a steady pace and the script is good but as is most the case in modern day movies ....The Acting is really poor Murphy and Dornan are truly unconvincing with dreadful accents, what a shame it really it could have been a great remake of a very good attempt back in the 70's,I would suggest to go and see this and make your own mind up, but also watch the 1970's movie Operation: Daybreak (1975)too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A potentially terrific tale not well told</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Watching these two brave but hapless assassins was more uncomfortable than thrilling. The machine gun did jam during the assassination but were the two assassins as hapless as portrayed? Probably not. In the movie holding a gun steady enough to fire was very problematic for one of the assassins. There could be no historical record of the opening scene that showed one assassin shaking to the extent that a gun could not be fired. A more believable approach to the two assassins would have been that they had way too much testosterone for their own good and accepted a basically impossible mission. There is not a lot of spy trade-craft in the movie. This is a story that demands a lot of detail on how spy operations are carried out but that detail is missing. How the Czech resistance operated is not really detailed. Not much background on the infinitely evil Heinrich Heydrich is given. Given the horrors of the inevitable reprisals the horrors of Heydrich should have been made clear. A lot of time is spent on doomed romances. There was more romance than spy trade-craft but not even the romances were well developed. Individuals in lust would have worked better than individuals in love. There actually was a terrific gunfight before the assassins were killed by German soldiers but in the movie the Germans soldiers appear tactically to be the worst soldiers ever which seems unlikely.'Anthropoid' could have been a very interesting movie, even with some slip-ups by the assassins, but though a terrific tale is potentially here the tale told is not well told. If you are looking for an 'Army of Shadows' kind of film or a 'Day of the Jackal' detailed story you should look elsewhere.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well...At Least It Was Free</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well...at least it was free.Good News and Bad News I saw Anthropoid this afternoon for free because I had a free movie ticket using my Regal card so I was able to view this film. That's the good news and of course it has Jamie Dornan-aka- Christian Grey from Fifty Shades of Grey-which is the ONLY reason I went to see this film in the first place.The bad news is...first I was in a theater by myself. Which is sort of cool because I felt like a rich woman and had a theater to myself which could be considered part of the good news. But the film itself I am just gonna be honest if Jamie wasn't in it, I wouldn't have even bothered. I am just going to be honest here, don't get mad at me, and I know they were speaking Czech but you could barely understand what they were saying, even if it was English.Anyways the story if you're not familiar with and to be honest I didn't really care about these two guys who plans to assassinate Hitler right-hand man SS General Reinhard Heydrich.If this film wasn't free I wouldn't have even bothered. Well no, that's not true, I watched it for Jamie because I am a fan of his but the film itself was boring. The acting was okay but like I said I only came to watch Jamie and he was cool. I'm not a big Nazi war person so I gave it a chance. I'm not going to give anything anyway but some of the scenes looked like they were taken from a video game Call of Duty. If you've seen the film then you know what scene I am talking about.If you are a Jamie Dornan fan you will like this film BUT I would wait for Redbox or for cable to play it because unless you are lucky to get a free movie ticket like me, it's really not worth it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good film...but not an intellectually honest one</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is, in many ways, a very well made film. It was somewhat weakened by the fact that, as it turns out, apparently the story of the assassination of Ubergruppenfuhrer Reinhard Heydrich (in 1942), just wasn't hugely interesting. It sounds like a great topic for a movie, but there just weren't enough actual events. They came, they saw, they slew Heydrich, they were betrayed, and they died as brave martyrs. The End.Additionally, and while I hate to turn everything into a political analysis (although the Second World War is pretty much the defining political event of the recorded history of the human species, so I think I'm on solid ground here), the epilogue of the film recounts the horrific aftermath of the 1942 assassination, and how this ostensibly aided in the Allied victory. But in order for this film not to be merely an exercise in feel-good, Allied propaganda, don't we need to look at the aftermath of that Allied victory? Would these hard and desperate men, brave, honorable Christian patriots to the hilt, have been so willing to lay down their lives for a free &amp; independent Czechoslovakia, had they known that in 1948 (just three years after the Allied victory), their nation would effectively be handed over to Stalin's Soviet Union? Sure, Czechoslovakia is peacefully liberated 41 years later...and now Prague is the pornography &amp; prostitution capitol of Europe. Oh, but don't worry, those erstwhile "industries" will soon be shut down by the rampaging hordes of Islamist invaders. Maybe these good men would wonder if perhaps they'd fought on the wrong dang side? Or maybe not. But to not ask the question, is BULLCRAP. Its propaganda, and its grotesque.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kind of annoying rendition of a pointless escapade. With bad accents!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As an amateur history buff, professor, and movie fan, I am more than willing to sit through "talky" movies. Historically accurate movies. Long, slow, reflective movies. But I have a problem with bad movies.This one was more like "the high school play," with the entire cast, mostly male, displaying annoying juvenile chest-pounding, shouting, and petulant disobedience.The few women in the cast lent little as well. Actually, now that I think about it I cannot think of a r3ason why any of the women were in any of the scenes. Maybe I'm exaggerating, but I sincerely ask, what were the women characters even supposed to be DOING? and the accents made it hard for me to understand 80% of the dialogue. I understand the whole discussion about accents, and the perspectives of the audience, etc. But dang, because they were evidently speaking English a lot of the time, I felt they should have spoken clearly enough fake or not, to be understood.I could have done with less of the random-seeming alpha make b.s. The "chest pounding" I referenced above.All in all, I found myself very ANNOYED by this production. Historically - the operation was kind of pointless. Cinematic ally, the artistic vision and rendering here was equally pointless, in my humble opinion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>unbelievable, if true</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>in the movie biz, august is known as dump month. it's where they dump moves that won't find an audience (sixth sense and suicide squad aside). anthropoid is no exception to the dump rule. it's bad. if it really is based on true events, one wonders why it took til d day to defeat the Nazi regime. paratroopers drop into chezoslavakia to kill one of Hitler's henchmen. they succeed, and the chezs pay the price. between the phony accents and terrible sound I couldn't catch half of what was said. my hearing is fine. the final twenty or so minutes is a prolonged gun fight, where most of the gestapo is killed. they are really stupid. cillian murphy, the only one in the cast I knew, doesn't add much to the proceedings. I also noticed 45% of the reviewers gave this a 10. maybe it's me.</fullReview>
