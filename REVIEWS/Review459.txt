		<fullReview>Here are a couple of things that must have gone through Rob Zombie's mind whilst shooting 31: "Who needs a plot when you got a psychopathic Nazi-midget?", "Who gives a damn about plausibility when you have Malcolm McDowell himself dressed up like a French Aristocrat and depicting a character that is named Father Murder?" and "Why would I make ambitious when the crowd simply wants sadistic &amp; graphic violence?" And you know what? If Rob Zombie really was thinking these things, he was damn right! Personally, I'm an enormous fan of Zombie's "House of 1,000 Corpses" and "The Devil's Rejects" and I remotely enjoyed his remake of "Halloween", even though the critics were quite harsh about it. But then he suddenly went psychedelic and experimental with "Halloween II" and "The Lords of Salem" and many fans ? yours truly included ? were disappointed. I, for one, was extremely happy to read that, with "31", Rob Zombie would return to the basics of crude and repulsive horror/shlock cinema! Because, after all, the revival of 70s grindhouse/drive-in exploitation cinema was largely the deed of Rob Zombie and not of Quentin Tarantino! So, "31" actually doesn't a have a real plot but is a mixture of homages to genre classics (for example "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre") and borrowed ideas of cult classics ("The Most Dangerous Game", "The Running Man"?) A ramshackle old RV full of traveling circus artists/carnies is driving through the middle of redneck nowhere on Halloween's day 1976, and pretty much all they ever do is foul-mouthing and fornicating. When night falls, however, they notice the road is blocked with immense scarecrows. Before they properly realize what's going on, the RV and all its passengers are brutally attacked by mysterious creeps and three people are killed instantly. The remaining five survivors, two women and three men, awake tied up and chained in an abandoned factory where three elderly lunatics dressed up as French Aristocrats joyfully inform them that they are the players in this year's traditional game of 31. They are released in a dark and creepy labyrinth and have to survive for twelve hours while being chased by some of the most demented sickos ever caught on film, including a Spanish babbling Nazi-midget, clown siblings with chainsaws and deranged German sex deviants. The group defend themselves quite well, though, and thus the crazy tormentors bring in their ultimate secret weapon, the unbeatable master-psycho Doom-Head! There isn't really too much to write about Rob Zombie's latest film, in fact. Either you're a fan of extreme and relentless violence and "31" is a must-see for you, or you'll completely detest the film for its lack of plot, character background, style or overall lack of taste. If even writer/director Zombie himself repeatedly stated that this is his most brutal movie to date, there isn't any reason to not believe him. "31" features numerous scenes in which people's heads are smashed in with a bludgeon, torsos are cut in half by chainsaws and throats are slit with rusty knives. Still, I can't help mentioning that most of this gruesome stuff also featured in "House of 1,000 Corpses" and "The Devil's Rejects", but those two were suspenseful and haunting on top! "31" is sheer mindless horror entertainment but it won't leave a long-lasting impression. As usual, Rob Zombie surrounds himself with a cast that he worked well with before, including his own wife Sheri Moon, Meg Foster, Jeff Daniel Philips and many other familiar faces. The soundtrack is terrific as well, which is another Rob Zombie trademark, and features for example the beautiful song "California Dreaming" during a rare quiet and peaceful scene.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rob Zombie is back and brutal as ever!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really enjoyed this movie, despite the awesome atmosphere of the crowd which included most of the cast and the director himself, it was the film itself that had me on the edge of my seat. The opening monologue by the most evil, dangerous and deadliest clown of them all Doom-Head himself (but don't call him a clown) sets an extremely exciting pace to the film. James Gang's Walkaway was the opening credit's song that immediately told us that we were back in the 70's just like Rob Zombie prefers to set most of his films in and he made the right choice again. Setting the film in 1976 made our main characters that bit more interesting but it was the cast itself that made these characters really enjoyable to watch, so we meet our quirky carnies and learn a bit about their own little world. But before long the carnies are on their way to their next gig, driving through the desert on Halloween eventually being kidnapped in a way that's quite different from what you'd expect from a Zombie movie and find themselves in Murderworld. An enormous underground compound run by three old psychos in powder wigs who explain the rules of the game known as 31 where five people each year are set free in Murderworld each given a numbered bracelet, a weapon and must try to survive for 12 hours which once over are set free but so far there has never been a winner. The five carnies are untied as they enter the labyrinth with a weapon waiting for the first of the six clowns known as the heads to attack. Then what commences is none stop attacks, fights to the death, torture, bloody mayhem and the true hell that is Murderworld! I found this film quite thrilling you really don't know what's going to happen next like when we see who the toughest of the carnies really is and how all the heads are all very unique. Yes the brutality is extreme even for Rob Zombie but what really makes this film stand out is the originality of the story and how characters defy every expectation not one character slows down this film in fact it's the characters that drive this film and surprise an impress you constantly because they keep changing yet still keep their character true. The soundtrack worked very well to set the tone and setting for the film just like Zombie's masterpiece The Devil's Rejects. The ending couldn't have been better and all the actors brought their A game. The actors that really stole the show were Richard Blake who was indescribable as Doom-Head, Sheri Moon Zombie as Charly surprised everyone as being a full on action hero when she had to be, Meg Foster who was so deeply fascinating as Venus occasionally being a bad-ass and Jeff Daniel Phillips as the macho mechanic that cares about his group and will defend them with a crowbar! All in all Zombie has made this fan very happy when it hits theaters will make all his fans happy but I don't think critics will like it then again most of the greatest horror movies of all time were hated by critics initially so don't let that stop you from watching this flick!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Carnival Ride through Hell.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I will start this review off by saying that I just finished watching this film for the one night early premiere for the Fathom Events showing. I also have seen all of Rob Zombies movies except "The Lords of Salem" which I intend to watch and I love all of his films. The story is very simple it is about five carnival workers who are kidnapped the night before Halloween in 1976 and they are then forced to survive 12 hours in "Murderworld" and that is the story. The acting was well cast. I didn't know the people who got kidnapped but they played their parts extremely well. The people who played the sociopath clowns were excellent. The costumes were on point and also made you chuckle which I believe was the desired effect. The star of this film though was Doom-Head who was played by Richard Brake. He honestly deserves an award for his performance which was immaculate. The action was dope. I mean the kills and the maiming were Incredible. I personally can't wait for the NC-17 version to release like Rob Zombie said it would because that will be even more Intense. The cinematography was impeccable in my opinion. The camera angels were all shot to induce a sense of dread and claustrophobia. I personally never got scared but that is because I'm a horror fiend. The location was a perfect choice even though it was shot in what appeared to be a warehouse but the team made it work. I will close with this and that is that this is a Must-Watch film. I plan to buy it Day One when it releases. The whole movie never felt rushed which is a major downfall especially in the horror/gore movies of today. The ending was realistic and not cheesy in my opinion. I personally feel anyone who loves a good manhunt movie will fall in love with this film as I did and thanks.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Despite Rob Zombie's best dialog and his best effort, this film feels watered down and very incoherent</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rob Zombie has become synonymous with the horror genre over the past decade. From House of 1000 Corpses to The Lords of Salem, Zombie has solidified himself as a household name right around Halloween time. Whether it'd be The Devil's Rejects or the Halloween remakes, you've heard of his name, you've more than likely seen his films, and whether or not you like him, you know what he does. So when you hear that Rob Zombie is doing a film about a bunch of circus performers who are kidnapped by a band of psychotic killers and forced to play a cat and mouse game called 31 on Halloween night for survival, you can imagine exactly what Rob Zombie has in store for us. Unfortunately, our imaginations are left running rampant especially after seeing the final product. The film leaves you feeling uninspired and very empty, all in the worst way possible. Sure, The Devil's Rejects left me feeling empty but that was because I was so scared and frightened by that film that there was nothing else left to feel. Mostly every film that Rob Zombie has done, I've ended up really liking just for the mere fact that the man is extremely dedicated to getting the 1970s right on screen. He succeeds every single time. There isn't a filmmaker working today that can submerge you into a time period like Rob Zombie does. The clothes, the environment, the people, the sounds, and even the camera work. He does a brilliant job at period pieces in the 70s. 31 is no exception. Despite this attention to detail, the film is a whole other beast, one with a couple good points and many bad points. First, let's start off with the bad and get that out of the way. First off, the biggest problem I had with the film was the camera work. The cinematography was so lackluster and amateur that it lacked any sort of punch when watching. The violence came and went without any real repercussions from it, no reverberation like The Devil's Rejects and no overt gore like House of 1000 Corpses. It just happened and it happens through the eyes of a very shaky cameraman. The film felt more of a Bourne film than this summer's abysmal Jason Bourne. It didn't allow for you to take in what had just happened and leaves you wondering whether you are ready to see a horror film or a hand-to-hand action film. It doesn't fit very well with the style of Rob Zombie and, at the end of the day, it hurts the film especially when you couple it with an erratic editing pattern which leads me into my next gripe. The film is very hard to keep track of. Much like the killers trying to find their victims in the film, our eyes are trying to find just what the hell is going on in the frame. Through the scenes of chaos and violence, we're left with incoherent editing choices along with lackluster camera work that borders on the edge of looking and feeling like a found footage horror film without the idiotic leads looking directly at us. It really made for a frustrating and headache inducing watch. The film also felt extremely watered down. I know that Rob Zombie has had his battles with the MPAA but this felt as though it was his most watered down venture yet. We see glimpses of knives piercing a stomach...no blood. We see a bat being bashed into someone's head in, minimal blood. We see a chainsaw death, blood spattering the floor and then close shots of the actors. This is a Rob Zombie film and, like I said above, I want some Rob Zombie gore and I simply didn't get it. He said it was going to be his most brutal film and this theatrical cut ended up being his most tame. While I will most certainly give 31's "Unrated" cut a watch to see what I was missing out on, I still hold this film in a bit of contempt over that. The performances here are lackluster as well. Sherri Moon Zombie gives a notable performance but nothing out of the realm of what she is already used to doing. It isn't bad but it isn't necessarily good. The horror icon Meg Foster also delivers a very good and surprisingly nuanced performance in the film as well. However, the main villain Doomhead is the real stand out. Actor Richard Brake is tremendous in this film. He is terrifying, funny and completely watchable as he delivers some of the best lines of Rob Zombie's career as a writer. He is full convincing as a psychopath in most films but this film, he truly looks and feels like he is a real, genuine psychopath and it makes for a great time watching him. The first scene of the film is Richard Brake, the camera and us for a long and thoroughly engrossing four minute monologue that feels of early Tarantino. It is a great opening scene and really gets you excited to see the film but leaves you even more disappointed when you discover that the film is nothing like the opening scene. Overall, I felt let down by 31. I wanted more gore, I wanted more coherency, I just wanted more and I feel like the film that I saw was half of the original vision that Rob Zombie had. Whether or not we will ever get to see a different cut is up in the air as of right now but it really does feel more like a missed opportunity than anything else. Despite these feelings, 31 does feature some great set designs, a great performance from Richard Brake and some truly wonderful lines of dialog from Rob Zombie. If you're a fan of Zombie's work, check out the film, you might like it. If not, skip it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Rob Zombie fan no more</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To start off, I have loved previous Zombie films. House of 1000 Corpses and Devils Rejects were at one point two of my favorite films. With that said, this film is just bad. I just came from the Fathom Events and was so disappointed by this movie I opened this account just to write this review. There are numerous things this movie lacks and going into this film I did not expect a masterpiece, but instead good ol bloody fun. Sadly, the blood could not save this film.We find ourselves with a simple plot revolving 5 individuals forced to play a game called "31". They must fight to survive the night and win the game. The killers have a clown based appearance making for what appears to be a fun ride.After the premise is revealed the film immediately goes down hill. To start off no character development is really made with both the survivors or villains of the movie. When the killings begin we feel indifferent to who lives or dies. When the deaths do occur, they are disappointing especially in comparison to Zombie's past. By this I mean, most of the kills are done by stabbings, which either cut to black, or show minimal damage. I'm not saying the lack of gore is what makes this movie bad, but I figured it would be Zombie's scape goat if anything. Unfortunately the movie progresses with no real development of plot and ends with what appears to be a copy of a scene found within other Zombie films. Which normally would be a cool throwback, but in this case seemed lazy.From here I could go on about the issues with this movie, but ill just bullet point them.- The editing seemed as if a fan of Zombie's film had made this. Overuse of "vintage" effects just became detrimental. - The killers lacked any real character. It's as if he thought "Killer clowns are scary, enough said". So with that said the killers are just that, new clowns in different "Weird attire".- The killers lack any power. As the film nears its remaining 30 minutes, we see the heroes plow through "killers" like nothing.It's as if everyone was on the same playing field and this was just a brawl.- With such a simple premise of "Killer clowns" most would immediately assume the setting is going to be a carnival or something related. Instead we are introduced to the characters in a great looking carnival Esq setting in the very beginning, then the film immediately places all the characters in the most clichéd looking "pipe room" that is completely gray and dark. I assume this was due to budget constraints, but then why the lavish room to simply introduce the characters? This poor use of setting is later seen in a room that is shown which looks like a typical mini circus tent but is actually a cage. This room was only used for a few minutes on screen and completely abandoned after. Returning all characters to the pipe room.- The acting was poor. Like just scare actor at your local Halloween attraction bad. That goes for both heroes and villains. The only one who had evident talent Meg Foster. Her performance was brilliant with the material she had.FINAL THING. After the movie there was a "Q&amp;A From Rob Zombie". The first question was "What inspired you to make this film?" His answer was "Well , I was working on a movie that got stuck in production hell so I called up my team and told them ' I can pitch you the dumbest simple idea that will make money right now in 30 seconds" "Its Halloween... uh people get kidnapped....uh clowns kill them. boom that'll make money." This was the moment I was not only disappointed in the movie but Rob Zombie himself. This man practically had the audience sit through a poor excuse of a movie THEN had the nerve to basically include a feature that tells them they were dumb for falling for it. All said and done, if you like Rob's past movies just avoid this one. Trust me, it will shine a light on the idea that maybe Rob never had any talent, but instead used the same tricks until they got old.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Saw With Rednecks; Zombie's Worst Yet</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>31 (2016) * (out of 4) A group of carnival workers are on their way to a job when they are kidnapped by psychotic clowns. Once chained up in a building, Father Murder (Malcolm McDowell) informs them that they're going to play a game, which will last twelve hours. They can either survive or face the worst death possible from his killer clowns.Rob Zombie's 31 is a film that he's highly been promoting and this includes before it was even made. There was a teaser poster released and fans helped get the movie made but the plot of the film was kept secret and it's easy to see why because there's not much of one. Sadly, what we've basically got is SAW but with the redneck/white trash types that we've seen in every Zombie movie up to this point. Sadly this here turns out to be the director's worst film.31 has all sorts of problems with it and a majority of them are the same issues I've had with his previous movies. For starters, the characters are all just annoying to the point where you don't really care whether they live or die. I'm not sure why it's so hard for their to be a likable character in one of Zombie's films but if you don't have anyone to root for what's the point? Well, I guess it could be one of those movies where you root for the villains but that's impossible here too because the villains are all boring and just not that interesting. Heck, they're not even "clowns" but just the typical rednecks but with face paint.Another problem that I had with this film is that it's simply not scary. As was the case in THE LORDS OF SALEM, Zombie tries to build up tension and suspense but it just fails. There's just nothing here that draws you into the story and when you're watching a film like this and there's no tension it just leads to pure boredom. Even worse is some of the lighting because there are times where you can't see what's going on and other times when lights are flashing at the camera and whatever effect they were going for just doesn't work.Zombie promised that this here would be his most violent movie and I don't think that was the case either. A lot of the violence is off screen or just not nearly as brutal as he has delivered in the past. The performances are pretty much what they are with everyone doing a decent enough of a job. The music selection is good and I will say that there was one good sequence inside a cage with a chainsaw. Still, there's just no way around it but Zombie just isn't impressing me as a director. 31 could have been done countless other ways and any of them would have been better than what we got.</fullReview>
