		<shortDescription>Surpising and delightful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had never heard of this movie before and had low expectations. However, I was amazed at what a wonderful movie it is. Not only is it "Hitchcocky" and suspenseful, it is also humorous and touching. Jane Wyman and Richard Todd did particularly well in this film. I do not usually like Marlene Dietrich, but I have to admit that she did a splendid job as the flamboyant theater star. This movie is set in London, and Hitchcock did a wonderful job of picking out the crew's British actors and actresses such as Alistair Sim and Michael Wilding. Surprisingly he even gave his own daughter, Patricia Hitchcock, a bit part towards the end. It is too bad "Stage Fright" is not more well known, and I highly recommend it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Superb..... Hitchcock's most underrated talkie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>black comedy that boasts great performances from Jane Wyman, Marlene Dietrich, Michael Wilding, Alistair Sim, Sybil Thorndike, Joyce Grenfell, Kay Walsh &amp; Richard Todd. Great use of silent sequences, close ups, slow motion, black humor, and mood lighting, Hitch's most underrated talkie (Easy Virtue is is most underrated silent film), this murder mystery offers all kinds of plot twists and sly humor even though you know the outcome long before it unspools. It's irrelevent. Fun all the way, including the opening theatre curtain and the closing one (thump). Dietrich is a splendid bitch, and this may be the best performance Wyman ever gave. Also look for Everley Gregg, Patricia Hitchcock, Miles Malleson and Ballard Berkeley. Dietrich's final close up and the coach scene with Wyman and Todd are gems. Sim and Thorndike are hilarious, as is the always wonderful Grenfell as "Lovely Ducks." A Must See.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a great flick. At times ill-paced, but the performances more than make up for it. What's not to love? Doe-eyed Jane Wyman shifts effortlessly between the roles of aspiring dramatist to lovestruck protectress of Richard Todd to infiltrating false maid of Marlene Dietrich. Managing also to string along Michael Wilding, as the ubercool Inspector "Ordinary" Smith, she might sound like some cold calculating wench who uses up people like Marlene goes through hats. But that wouldn't be strictly accurate. Her Eve Gill is sweet and naive, but her gentler qualities are tempered with a genuine acting talent that allows her to juggle identities with the slyness of a fox-chameleon hybrid. The scene at the garden party when she switches from Dietrich's cockney maid to Smith's innocent date with every turn is delightful.It is the masterful presence of the great Alastair Sim, however, that makes Stage Fright one of Hitchock's most enjoyable to watch. Few actors have his ability of making the most average of dialouges sound like a powerful oration, and as Eve's doting father, he makes the movie. His Commodore Gill is always at the ready to harbor a fugitive, clip off a snappy witicism, or scrounge blackmail money for his beloved daughter. He is equally at home playing comic relief as he is to serving as the plot glue that makes Eve's capers possible. But live with his wife? Thank you, no! He is content to live on his boat. Whether he is staging an amusing diversion to aid Eve, dispensing sage bits of fatherly advice, or merely strolling out in public, the man bleeds coolness with every move.Some can argue that Stage Fright gives but an average treatment to the usual whodunnit murder-suspense formula that Hitchcock (and countless others) have used. This is perhaps true. But compared to the whole lot of crappy facsimile suspense films made since 1950, Stage Fright is quicker to entertain than most.Be sure to check it out if you want to see Hitch cast his own daughter Patricia in the supporting role of "Chubby Banister." Is that some kind of sick joke or was that name flattering in the fifties?P.S.-- I can't watch Marlene Dietrich anymore and not be reminded of Madeline Kahn's Teutonic Titwillow. Is there some free therapy I can get for this?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie gets a very much undeserved amount of flack for being a lessor work of Hitchcock. I can see why it might not appeal to some people, being character driven rather than having children being chased by rampant birds or someone being attacked by a serial killer in an old lady's wig. The performances here are all excellent especially Jane Wyman and Marlene Dietrich as Charlotte Inwood, perhaps the laziest girl in town but also the most flamboyant. The secondary characters are also in fine form and make memorable impressions that adds to the enjoyment factor of this film. I don't know why some people feel tricked after watching the movie, seeing and believing are two different things, especially in an Alfred Hitchcock movie!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A solid, entertaining Hitch flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Often considered to be one of Alfred Hitchcock's lesser known films, "Stage Fright" has unfortunately gotten a bad wrap. Even mediocre Hitchcock is better than most movies ever get, though. And this one is a solid, entertaining picture. With an eclectic cast one doesn't expect to see together, each diverse actor provides a little something for everyone. And with Jane Wyman, Marlene Dietrich, Richard Todd and Michael Wilding how can you go wrong?Wyman convincingly plays a drama student who gets involved over her head in a purely Hitchcockian case of murder. When her ex-lover Todd is suspected of killing Dietrich's husband, Wyman hides him and helps him allude the police. Meanwhile, Wyman disguises herself as Dietrich's maid to help find evidence to save Todd's freedom. Wyman falls into a dangerous trap, and danger surrounds her.Disappointingly underdeveloped as it starts, "Stage Fright" eventually turns into a first-rate thriller. While Wyman has been better, Dietrich is hilariously catty and Todd is wickedly suspicious. This is undoubtedly a Hitchcock film all the way around, but adding a nice twist to the formula is a soaring, romantic soundtrack. A seriously satisfying film, "Stage Fright" hits most of the right notes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Stage Fright" has become one of my favourite Hitchcock movies. Even though it's not in the same league as "Psycho" or "Rear Window", it's still an extremely delightful piece of film making.What makes it so enjoyable is the wonderful cast, which was mostly unknown to me before. Jane Wyman makes a lovely heroine for the audience to care about, and Marlene Dietrich is a riot as the stage diva, although I was a bit skeptical toward her at first. The scenes between Alastair Sim and Sybil Thorndike as Wyman's eccentric parents are hilarious. Richard Todd is perhaps a bit weak as the suspected murderer, but not distractingly so.All in all, I find this a far more preferable watching experience than some of his more acclaimed films like "Notorious" or "The Birds" which are kind of cold and sterile. See it if you have the chance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So Who Cares About Conventions?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I like this film. It has gotten a bad reputation due to Hitchcock's daring to break another film convention about the truth of a flashback. Hitchcock had already broken other conventions over the years, some being of a technical variety (the nine minute uncut takes on ROPE for instance). Here the film begins with Richard Todd describing what he claims happened to the murdered man to ex-girl friend Jane Wyman. Subsequently we learn that the explanation is not totally true.What I find interesting about this particular issue is that the same people who denounce Hitchcock for cheating on this probably have found other films acceptable despite similar "cheating". Take Billy Wilder's WITNESS FOR THE PROSECUTION. We hear Tyrone Power give Leonard Vole's version of what happened to the rich elderly woman (Norma Varden), about how they met, about what he was doing on the night she was murdered. We do not SEE the actual view of his activities for the night of the murder, but we accept his comments - until the end of the film shows what happened. Also check out Kurasawa's film classic RASHOMON, where we see flashbacks of five people who show "what happened" and at the conclusion we really don't know if we heard the truth or if everyone has lied. The same can be said of the American remake of RASHOMON, THE OUTRAGE. Even a musical comedy, LES GIRLS, leaves us all guessing at the end.Yet Hitchcock was condemned for his cheating. I think he should be praised for his daring, for this film (of all Hitchcock's movies) develops in a unique way. Wyman is determined to prove the truth of Richard Todd's story, and keeps meeting criticism and common sense from her father, Alistair Sim, and from the police led by Michael Wilding, who don't believe him. And as a matter of fact, at the conclusion, it turns out that some, if not all of Todd's flashback has elements of truth in it.Hitchcock told Francois Truffaud that he saw STAGE FRIGHT as an opportunity to work with some great British character actors (Sim, Joyce Grenville, Sybil Thorndyke, Kay Walsh). The film was definitely lower budgeted than other films (SPELLBOUND, even THE PARADINE CASE) that he had recently made. The most expensive aspect was working with Dietrich which was costly for her salary and her designer clothing. But Hitchcock wanted a chance to work with Dietrich here (just like he had made MR. AND MRS. SMITH to work with Carole Lombard in 1939). The results were quite good. The British character actors did the most with their parts (including Todd, who shows a nervousness and uncertainty in most of the film that is suggestive of possible insanity at the end). Dietrich also, in her closing moments on the screen, shows a bitterness and hatred that I don't think she ever showed in any other film role. Jane Wyman was criticized by Hitchcock for insisting on dressing up as the film progressed. However she does show a resourcefulness and pluck not usually seen in most of her movies. On the whole the film works pretty well to me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent! One of Hitchcock's most underrated. 9/10</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILERS: Like any good film enthusiast, I consider Hitchcock one of the best directors who ever lived, right along with the likes of Fellini, Bergman, and Welles. Hitch consistently made films that were not only as entertaining as a film can possibly get, but also films that were extraordinarily intellectual and human. Films such as Lifeboat, Rear Window, and Vertigo work as art as much as any other films ever made, studying the human condition and utilizing the tools of cinema to the utmost.Hitch was also the most prolific film artist of all time. He made over 50 films. He made more masterpieces than any other filmmaker, too. Several, such as Vertigo, Psycho, and Rear Window, are bona fide masterpieces. No one in their right mind would disagree with their status as some of the best films ever made. But everyone has that one Hitchcock film that they feel that they understand better than anyone else, and always claim that it deserves to belong in the same status as the more accepted masterpieces. I seem to have discovered several. In fact, every time I see one of his less popular films, I think that it has gotten a bum rap. Rope is my favorite underrated Hitchcock film, but I think that it is starting to be accepted by the masses more. Two other great ones that are less popular are Lifeboat and I Confess; Lifeboat is well respected by Hitchcock fanatics, but I Confess is usually dismissed. This sort of dismissal happens because of financial failure upon first release. Hitch certainly was an artist, but, if you've read the Truffaut interview book, you realize that he took a film's financial success or failure very personally.Now we come to Stage Fright. I don't think that it was an enormous failure, but it was also not an enormous success. Truffaut says something like: "this film neither added to nor took away from your reputation." The main complaint is that the opening flashback is a lie, and that audiences could never accept that. I think that that technique works better now than it may have in 1950. It was sort of daring, but it failed at the time. Although most people still don't want to ever think that the characters in a film are lying, you still see it, especially in neo-noir (think Chinatown, Body Heat, etc, although those aren't flashbacks, per se). Truffaut also derides it for being a whodunit, which Hitch did not like. I don't think that Stage Fright is at all a whodunit. We assume through the entire film that Marlene Dietrich is unquestionably guilty in the crime.There are just a few very minor problems in the film, most of them stemming from the trick ending: trick endings are in style right now, but they hardly ever work. This one does, mostly, but as soon as we realize we've been tricked, just as happens at the end of The Sixth Sense, a very good film otherwise, we begin to go over the earlier events to see if there was any cheating. There is in Stage Fright, and it loses a tiny bit of credibility from this. The other main problem is just how the police deal with the criminals at the end. It's hardly believable, and they kill the main criminal in a very gruesome way that I would think would get them reprimanded by their superiors (although it was cool). Anyway, it's nowhere near as bad as the way the police act at the end of Hitch's next film, Strangers on a Train, where a cop shoots randomly at a crowd (with the criminal in it) and accidentally kills an innocent man!The gold of this film comes in the complex situations and characters. One reason why Hitch's films stand so far beyond the run-of-the-mill thriller is that his characters are so well developed. The actors in Stage Fright are also superb. Jane Wyman, the main character, has an extraordinarily complicated role, where she has to act at several different levels (she plays an actress who believes that her skills can help her learn more about a murder); she pretends that she's someone else, and as she meets more people, the more difficult it becomes to handle the situation. She also "switches horses in midstream," where she begins to doubt her relationship with the man whom she is helping and to fall for a detective on the murder case simultaneously. Richard Todd plays a man framed for murder. One excellent twist in the script is that his character is not intelligent. We're so used to characters being as astute as Sherlock Holmes in mystery films, but he's an illogical hothead who takes very stupid risks. Marlene Dietrich has a lot of fun here playing a demon-goddess. She's just hilarious, trying really hard to act depressed over her husband's death (and she's one of the most terrible singers you'll ever hear!). I love how she controls everyone in the film, even those who are trying to be her enemies. You just can't refuse Marlene! Possibly the most memorable and amusing performance in the film is that of Alastair Sim, most famous for playing Ebenezer Scrooge a year later. He's hilarious as Wyman's father. Micheal Wilding, playing the detective who is falling for Wyman, is also great, especially when he finds that she is betraying him and may have only been using him. There are a few very memorable cameos, too, including the "bibulous gent," a turtle-like man who offers Wyman comfort, and the shooting gallery matron (the whole shooting gallery scene is great).Stage Fright has been trampled by the more outstanding Hitchcock pictures. It is a small gem, not boring in any way. It deserves to be rediscovered by more people.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Somewhat Odd Combination That Works Most of the Time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With such an unusual set of components, it was probably inevitable that "Stage Fright" would be a little uneven, but most of it works well enough. By Hitchcock's standards, it's average at best, but it is still an entertaining movie with an interesting story and a number of good sequences.Simply seeing the distinctive persona of Marlene Dietrich and the enjoyably unique style of Alastair Sim in an Alfred Hitchcock film would make for an interesting combination in itself. They are joined by a generally solid group of performers, with their own individual styles, and there are several characters who all get fairly sizable roles.Hitchcock's own approach here is a somewhat surprising contrast from his usual style of story-telling, and some of the developments must have seemed even more unexpected to the movie's original viewers. Another aspect of this is that for much of the movie none of the characters really takes and holds the focus, and as a result there are times when it seems to lack some flow.Yet there are a number of good points to it as well. There are plenty of the usual Hitchcock details that make things more interesting, and most of the cast members give good performances in themselves. Most of Hitchcock's movies are rather better than this one, but watching "Stage Fright" is still a better use of one's time than watching the weak present-day efforts in the genre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Frightfully good!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This superb film incredibly contains Marlene Dietrich and Alistair Sim among its great cast, in a blend of Hitchcock thrills and chills, humour and even musical interludes. It is mostly overlooked due to it's original 'failure' with fans and critics caused mainly by misguided hatred of a plot device used in the film. Also people fail to cope with the very different moods the film moves between. From whimsical British comedy to chilling psychological drama. It may not be one of Hitchcock's perfect 10/10 best but is easily 9 1/2 out of 10.Hitchcock did something in the film, as he did in his classic Sabotage, which upset filmgoers and critics because it was 'not the done thing'. I wouldn't wish to spoil the film for a 1st time viewer by saying what this was but it is mentioned in the spoilers section of trivia on this films IMDb homepage. It is a mistake, I feel to overlook this film, especially due to this 'unconventional plot device'.I find the 'unconventional plot device' in Sabotage one of a great many highlights of the film and it lifts it beyond what it would have been with the predictable/conventional resolution of that scene. The same is true in Stage Fright. Filmgoers who cannot cope with being confused by clever directorial choices are people I pity. The surprising, unusual aspects of this plot are terrific and Hitchcock was entirely correct in his choices which hugely add to the impact of the film.Apart from all that Stage Fright is simply thoroughly entertaining. It is very very funny with Alistair Sim as brilliant and hilarious as ever in a great role for him as well as an entirely satisfying cast. Marlene Dietrich is superbly cold in a wonderful, striking addition to her acting career and sings a classic Dietrich style song. The twists from humour to chilling suspense make terrific enthralling moments.A highly unusual and near perfectly executed film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of Hitch's most underrated films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>--Minor Spoilers--While reading user comments for other Hitchcock movies, I came across this phrase often, generally in association with TOPAZ:"This is by far Hitchcock's worst since STAGE FRIGHT..." or something to that effect.Maybe I'm just a hopeless blabbering Hitchcock fan, but I found Topaz and Stage Fright to be much better than the press they've gotten.Stage Fright has been accused of being boring, although I suspect this is because there is no violence at all until the very end of the movie, and instead it deals quite a bit with dialogue and character development.At first, I thought the acting was overdone, but 30 minutes into the movie, I didn't even notice. And of course, I can't say enough about Alisair Sim's performance as Eve (Jane Wyman)'s father. He was amazing in this movie.I also thought Stage Fright contained quite a bit more of Hitchcock's dark sense of humor (note the bar and shooting gallery scenes, and Marlene Dietrich's comments while trying on her funeral gown). Absolute hilarious!Overall the movie is a keeper. It certainly isn't as good as PSYCHO or THE BIRDS or any of his other 50s-60s classics, and Hitchcock doesn't do much of his fancy camerawork (although the mingling through the bar was very nice), but this movie is surely no worse than JUNO AND THE PAYCOCK or TORN CURTAIN. And the usual Hitchcockian plot twist is always a nice touch.STAGE FRIGHT is probably one of Hitchcock's most forgotten and most underappreciated movies.9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>not classic Hitchcock, but still good.....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie plays more like something Hitchcock would have directed in the thirties. It also have the misfortune of being released while he was in his prime, so it comes off archaic for the master. I rather enjoyed it though. I thought Jane Wyman had considerable charm and innocence to play her character and make us care for her. Marlene Dietrich plays her part well, and Alastair Sim gives nice comic relief as the father to Wyman's character. Its true that the movie cheats and gives us a surprise ending that really doesn't play with what we're given. This is a flaw and will forever keep this movie from being a masterpiece. However, it is lite viewing, and it has some excellent and charming scenes. The scene of Eve and the Inspector in the back of the taxi was rather nice, at least I thought so. Plus it has more humor than some of his other works. It certainly isn't rear window, but its worth watching for Wyman's fun and interesting performance. Its nice to see a heroine more so than a hero in something of Hitchcock's. Plus you can find out a hazard of the safety curtain that we hadn't thought of. 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Deep down, this is a film about the way people use each other. Whereas many films present us with love triangles, 'Stage Fright' explores the sharp edges of a love pentagon, in which all five characters are engaged in subterfuge and manipulation. At the heart of it lies Richard Todd's Jonathon Cooper, ruthlessly playing on Eve's affection for him in order to protect both himself and the woman he really loves, Charlotte. However, actress Charlotte is using him just as he uses Eve, whilst behind his back she's involved with her manager Freddy. And sweet little Eve, actress in training, is far from innocent - she lies to the charming 'Ordinary' Smith whilst concealing the man she thinks she loves - Jonathon.Perhaps the most disappointing thing about 'Stage Fright' is that this daisy chain of betrayal is dismantled with barely a broken heart in sight. Unflinching insights into emotional cruelty and power imbalances in relationships are one of the most under-appreciated aspects of Hitchcock's films ('Rebecca', 'Notorious', 'Vertigo' and 'Marnie' in particular, although even the minor barbs James Stewart throws at Grace Kelly in 'Rear Window' hit the mark squarely), but here one of the most calculated betrayals in all of his work has absolutely no emotional resonance. Eve has already conveniently fallen into the arms of Smith, so there's no sting when she learns of Jonathon's deceit. Charlotte's betrayal of Jonathon carries no greater weight, because by this point the viewer has no empathy left for him. Only 'Ordinary' Smith's rather hurt reaction to learning the truth about Eve means anything, but it feels like a betrayal of a much slighter nature - she's a well-intentioned deceiver. Compare with the treachery of another Eve, in the similarly comic and 'lightweight' 'North by Northwest', and the sheer toothlessness of this film's emotional unravelling becomes apparent.In fact, the only emotional impact made in the film's finale is by Marlene Dietrich's Charlotte Inwood, mulling over her actions in a beautifully shot scene. Dietrich's sheer luminosity can't help but draw the viewer in, and the direction certainly favours her here. The perversity of empathising with this great manipulator probably appealed to Hitchcock, who would later do the same with Robert Walker's Bruno Anthony and Anthony Perkins's Norman Bates, and I think it's possibly the one great scene in the film (if there's another, it would be Dietrich's self-choreographed rendition of 'The Laziest Gal in Town').Mention of Walker and Perkins draws attention to the great failing of this film, which is the character of Jonathon Cooper. Richard Todd has been much criticised for his stiff portrayal, and I think it's fair to say he's rather a plodding performer, even if he's never truly bad - although his psychosis under the stage is tremendously effective. The real problem is the script, which denies the character a sense of humour. Almost all of Hitchcock's villains are witty and charming (certainly all his best ones are), but Jonathon is charmless. This is a real problem in a comedy thriller where almost every character has a comic appeal - even Kay Walsh's character has her own sour humour. By contrast, Jonathon seems repellent - he isn't entertaining in the way everyone else is, so we don't root for him. We should surely empathise with Eve's desperation to clear his name, but he doesn't seem worth the effort. Whilst Dietrich is appealing even at her most cruel (a true Hitchcockian villain), Todd is unappealing even in innocence.The other performances range from the adequate (Wilding, just a little too lightweight as Smith) to the wonderful (Alistair Sim, it scarcely needs to be pointed out, shares the comic spoils with Dietrich, and both Sybil Thorndike and Kay Walsh do great things with limited roles. Joyce Grenfell, meanwhile, somehow turns an irrelevant bit of comic business into a transcendent piece of physical comedy). Jane Wyman seems a little uncertain in places, but funnily enough I think she's most effective in her 'Doris' guise, able to show off her comic skills, and sparking nicely with Dietrich.The false flashback is a neat gambit, but unfortunately it unbalances the beginning of the film - Eve is sidelined for too long - and forces the script into some rather ugly expositional dialogue. However, the rising curtain is a lovely conceit.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How DID He Do That?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Forget the shot in "Notorious" where the camera slowly descends from the second floor to Ingrid Bergman standing in the foyer and a tight closeup of the key in her hand.Feast your eyes, instead (and try to figure out how cinematographer Wilkie Cooper shot it) on the sequence that begins outside Charlotte Inwood's residence, as Richard Todd gets out of his car, goes up the steps, opens the door, steps inside and . . . as the camera stays on his back, now inside the home . . . shuts the door behind him, starts up the stairs, reaches the second landing, crosses to Charlotte's bedroom door and enters. One continuous shot from exterior to interior and up the stairs. No cutaways. Amazing.The shot was echoed years later in reverse, in "Frenzy," where the camera pulls back from a murder, goes down the stairs and out the door onto the street.So why, one wonders, does Hitchcock settle for a cheap double-exposure shot of Dietrich in closeup in the foreground while Richard Todd is at the window in the background, when Gregg Toland had already achieved such "deep focus" shots without "trick photography" nine years earlier in "Citizen Kane?" Yes, Jane Wyman's American accent is problematic. A glancing reference to her having been "educated" in America doesn't solve the fact that she's supposed to be British.Marlene Dietrich is 50 and looks it. She actually looks younger seven years later in "Witness for the Prosecution." No matter.The acting is superb all around.The infamous "lying flashback" at the beginning seems far less troublesome to today's audiences than it did when the film was released, perhaps because we're more accustomed to films playing tricks with time, now.The character development is exceptional -- particularly the relationship between Jane Wyman and Michael Wilding. (Quick: name another film starring Michael Wilding. You can't.) Hitchcock takes his time with the characters. Wyman and Wilding in the taxi on the way to the garden party are wonderful.Is it necessary for Hitchcock to insist on superimposing a bloodstain on the doll's dress to let us know what Alastair Sim is thinking? No.But then, when you've delivered a shot as spectacular as that long dolly of Richard Todd from exterior to interior and up the stairs, you can do anything you darn well please.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The sets, cast, filming, and plot are all great--a full blooded success</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stage Fright (1950)Offhand, Marlene Dietrich and Alfred Hitchcock seem like an unlikely pair. But it works! Even if you find Dietrich wooden as an actress, you have to appreciate her aura, which was legendary, and which Hitchcock incorporates, and bounces against, with real virtuosity. There are two or three long scenes, as when Dietrich is trying on her mourning clothes and smoking under her veil, where the filming, the fast dialog, the light, the movement of the characters, and the editing are breathtaking.Taken in pieces like this, or seen as a whole, the film is a masterpiece of directing and construction. And at least three of the principle characters are just perfect--Jane Wyman as the innocent woman in the middle of it all, Alastair Sims as her father, and Dietrich. A fourth surprise performance is by Michael Wilding, who appears in many different scenes, and is charming, funny, and smart as a whip, playing a detective in love and in the dark. The plot itself is classic Hitchcock, with seeming innocence and guilt shifting as you watch, and ordinary people getting too involved in the solving of the crime. Including the viewer. Even the use of the flashback that anchors the beginning of the film as two of them speed away gets a huge twist by the end, both a narrative thrill and a logical one, in terms of film-making. Talk about verisimilitude getting in the way of realism.We know that the stage will play a large role throughout, and Hitchcock loved to include the theatre in his films. Christian Dior designed Dietrich's wardrobes, and the song is by none other than Cole Porter. The song is clever, but not his best, and Dietrich's performance, though supported by a fabulous set for a small time theater, is dull. The writing throughout is rather fabulous, partly thanks to Hitchcock's wife, who worked on it (and look for their daughter, by the way, at the lawn party). There is so much going right here, what keeps it from quite becoming a masterpiece? I think the key thing is the startling disparity in acting styles. I mean, Wyman, Sim, and Dietrich are about as odd a threesome as you get in terms of acting style. Wilding is a kind of lubricant throughout (he appears in scenes with all of them and seems to make them sensible). The other noticeable flaw might be the last several minutes, when a climax is building, and yet there is an odd diffusion and a sudden end to it all, as if an opportunity was lost to wring us out a little.But don't let this stand in your way. It's a terrific movie in all. I liked this more this time than any previous viewing, and I was left wondering why I had forgot so much about it. There is some really nice filming, it never gets boring, the sets and locations are fabulous, and some of the individual acting is a wonder. Including Dietrich.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a total Hitchcock misfire</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>STAGE FRIGHT (1950), whicch is usually dismissed as an Alfred Hitchcock failure, really has some fascinating things in it. As a whole, the film feels empty. The viewer knows they saw masterful construction work, but with lousy glue.Richard Todd plays a Londoner wrongly accused of murdering his mistresses' husband. He is befriended by a young actress (Jane Wyman), her eccentric dad (Alister Sim, perfect as a daffy version of a Brit gentleman)This film has arresting female characters (Marlene Dietrich is great as Todd's gal-pal. Patricia Hitchcock makes a top-grade debut in her father's films, and Kay Walsh is unforgettable as a blackmailer.) The film begins in mid chase, has a terrific long take during a flashback, several other chases across and around stages and outdoor performances. The finale in a cluttered, noir-ish prop room is good stuff. What truly mars the film is the uninteresting sub-plot with detective Michael Wilding.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Master of Suspense's most overlooked film, and a great one it is too.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't think it is as good as North By Northwest and Rebecca, but Stage Fright was a great film, and this is coming from a Hitchcock fan. The photography is beautiful, and so is the music, making some scenes like the one in the taxi very touching. The script is well crafted, and while you think you know what's happening, the final solution is very unpredictable. My only complaint for the film was the last couple of minutes, the film just ended abruptly without a rounded finish or even a monologue. I liked the story, about a man who is accused of murder and a friend of his sets out to clear his name, it is well told, and doesn't have a sense of contrivance, and I did fear it would do. As for the acting, I had very little problem with it, Jane Wyman was perfectly alluring as Eve. Michael Wilding delights as "Ordinary Smith", and while he started off a tad wooden, Richard Todd was fine too. Two of the film's stars impressed me the most though. One was Marlene Dietrich, who was deliciously frosty as the stage actress and singer Mrs Winstead. I find Dietrich quite captivating, with her lovingly designed clothes, beautiful face and distinctive voice, I thought she was a great actress. The other was Alistair Sim, who I consider the best Scrooge ever, with George C. Scott close behind- he had some very funny moments, the most notable one being at the garden party and the doll stall. Even Hitchcock himself has a cameo 30 minutes into the film, as does his daughter Patricia. I didn't know until the end credits, that Kay Walsh, Nancy in Oliver Twist, played the maid. All in all, a very overlooked film, that is actually very clever. It isn't Hitchcock's best, but it is a very good film. 9/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, it's identifiably a Hitchcock movie, but you have to watch it a little carefully to be sure. There are no dramatic set pieces, no mind-boggling crane shots, no screaming violins in the score, and the touches of humor are sparse and more understated than usual.The story is basically a murder mystery generated by a false flashback, for which Hitchcock evidently received some critical heat. It's hard to understand exactly why. The flashback is told by an unreliable and half-hysterical narrator (Richard Todd) to the decent girl (Jane Wyman) who loves him, although he is obsessed with a glamorous woman of the theater (Marlene Dietrich). The lie is satisfactorily cleared up at the end. And the device of the lying flashback is common enough now. But in 1950, "Rashomon" hadn't swum into public view yet.The performances are up to par. The film makes good use of established English character actors like Alistair Sim as Wyman's father, who is given the most amusing lines. At one point, Wilding the detective is chewing out Sim:Wilding: "How could you let your daughter get mixed up in a thing like this? What kind of father do you think you are?"Sim: "Unique."Marlene Dietrich gets the award for second-best lines. "Don't confide in me, dear, just pour me some tea." And then there is Joyce Grenfell, a toothy spinsterish lady running a shooting gallery at the garden party -- "Come and shoot lovely ducks!" Michael Wilding is pretty handsome, isn't he? Or is he. From some angles and at certain times, he looks and sounds like Danny Kaye.The tenor of the film is relaxed and casual. A bit unfocused at times. Joyce Grenfell is very funny but what is she doing in this scene? And what do we think is going to happen when Sims gets the little Cub Scout to climb on stage and present the blood-stained doll to Dietrich? Maybe it's supposed to catch her conscience, like Hamlet's play within a play, but it leads nowhere. The movie overall seems to lack tension, but it's still enjoyable to sit back and watch the characters go through their paces. All of the performances are good and the movie isn't a flop. It's just not one of Hitchcock's most memorable pieces, the kind only he was capable of.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Forgotten Hitchcock Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a fine movie by Director Hitchcock in which Jane Wyman shines as the aspiring stage actor trying to get to the truth of a murder. It is usually overlooked or forgotten in evaluations of Hitchcock's overall work. Wyman's friend Richard Todd is on the run from the police. In an effort to out the guilty party, she enlists the help of her father, played by the great Alastair Sim. She worms her way into the household of a far more accomplished actor, Marlene Dietrich, impersonating a servant. She also wins the heart of a police inspector, Michael Wilding. She is at the forefront of this entertaining little film as she changes wardrobes and accents, going back and forth from London to her country home. The cast is strong all-round and, in addition to the above, are the talented Dame Sybil Thorndike, Joyce Grenfell and Kay Walsh, not to mention Patricia Hitchcock, the director's daughter, who often performed very capably in his movies. The movie is a black comedy that moves along at a great pace, with interesting vignettes and the long takes that Hitchcoock used so effectively. The on-location shooting in London gives the movie a reality missing in Hitchcock's earlier films. I liked this movie very much and with Wyman's acting and Hitchcock's direction, it works well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Perfectionist Hitchcock did not like the opening flaw of this film story, where the initial flashback does not match the rest of the film. But this film is so much more than that once I viewed it. It might be the only film where Hitch does 2 Cameos - though one is so subtle that it is hard to catch while the other is very obvious. The film does continue most of the themes of his prior work. Stairways are a central theme within the plot. Camera angles are used with very great care.Mostly this is a great performance film. For whatever reason, the cast all have some of their best roles acting on film. Jane Wyman &amp; Marlene Dietrich are both great. While Dietrich might have a better performance someplace, this is the best Wyman I have ever seen anywhere. The male cast is fantastic, every one of them. In this film Alstair Sim (who would play Scrooge the next year) has his best performance in any film of his I have seen in addition to the classic as Wymans father. The support in this film is so strong that by the end, the viewer does not care about the beginning not making complete sense because Hitch &amp; the actors have overcome that with a well made movie.Hitchcocks next Warner film would be Dial M For Murder. While that one is more famous, this movie filmed in London with a strong British cast is worth while viewing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Stage Fright (1950)' certainly isn't one of Alfred Hitchcock's greatest films, but I like it ? quite a lot, in fact. From 1949-1950, the Master of Suspense took a temporary break from Hollywood film-making and produced two UK productions, the first being 'Under Capricorn (1949),' a fascinating but relatively unengaging melodrama with superb camera-work. The second, a return to his standard narrative form after two noticeably experimental pictures, was an adaptation of the story "Man Running" by Selwyn Jepson. With a wonderful British supporting cast, centred around Hollywood stars Jane Wyman and Marlene Dietrich, the film has a distinctly British feel to it, and not just because of the actors and setting. Hitchcock's whimsical sense of humour, evident in a great many of his pictures, is allowed to permeate the traditional drama/romance storyline, and the film would certainly have felt comfortable alongside the Ealing comedies of the late 1940s and early 1950s, many of which employed darkly comedic overtones.There's something about Jane Wyman that immediately caught my eye while watching this film. Behind her rosy cheeks, timid eyes and soft voice, there's a certain innocence and vulnerability about her demeanour that really drew my sympathy. Her character, Eve Gill, is basically a petty schoolgirl, driven by silly but unwavering aspirations to uncover the truth, and her delicate personality is punctuated by moments of stubbornness, and, indeed, some occasional bravery. I've never really taken to actress Marlene Dietrich, and I find her distinct European accent and stunted line-delivery to be rather distracting; however, she does passably well as Charlotte Inwood, demonstrating an arrogant disposition that forms a strong contrast with the mild personality of Wyman's character. As far as the male actors are concerned, strong performances are given by Richard Todd as the wrongly-accused boyfriend {for some reason or another, the Irish actor reminded me of Joaquin Phoenix}, Michael Wilding as the honest and romantic detective with whom Eve inevitably falls in love, and Alastair Sim is a lot of fun as our leading lady's loving and playful father.In comparing Alfred Hitchcock's films with those of his contemporaries, it's interesting to note how the director made stunning, dynamic use of the camera. Both 'Rope (1948)' and 'Under Capricorn (1949)' had made pioneering use of long-takes, sweeping the camera across the room with astonishing style and grace. For the first time, Hitchcock {and cinematographer Wilkie Cooper} integrated these techniques into a more traditional film-making style, and multiple sequences play out in a single take; my favourite shot follows Cooper (Richard Todd) through Charlotte's front door, and smoothly rises with him as he ascends the staircase. Another interesting element to the film, which met with much criticism upon its release, is the ingenious use of a false flashback, as Cooper's recount of past events is revealed to be little more than an elaborate lie. As the anecdote was explicitly treated as Cooper's own version of events, I see little "dishonesty" in Hitchcock's clever manipulation of the audience, and the final twist certainly succeeded in taking me by surprise ? though I probably should have noticed something amiss when the romance between Eve and Smith began to develop.</fullReview>

Inspector Wilfred Smith(Michael Wilding)is in shrewed pursuit of Jonathan Cooper(Richard Todd)to charge him for murder. The high society singer may find herself the victim of a double cross exposing her ill deed. Featured is the sultry Dietrich's version of Cole Porter's "The Laziest Gal In Town".

		<shortDescription>Modest but enjoyable Hitchcock flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Stage Fright" is an entertaining and mostly lighthearted mystery; perhaps its themes are less consequential than in other Hitchcock films, but it still delivers a good time. It utilizes its theatrical setting well, contrasting truth with artifice, and acting with reality. And its characters are interesting and well-developed.Musical-comedy star Charlotte Inwood's (Marlene Dietrich) husband has been murdered, and her lover Jonathan (Richard Todd) fears that she committed the crime and is trying to frame him for it. While he hides from the police, Eve (Jane Wyman), an aspiring actress who has a crush on Jonathan, poses as Charlotte's maid in order to get the evidence that will clear his name.At least, that's how things seem?to us, and to Eve. But at the end of the movie, we learn that someone lied at the beginning, twisting the facts, and the real situation is different. Though this "lying flashback" is widely considered to have caused "Stage Fright"'s failure, it actually feels necessary to me. This movie needs a twist to distinguish it, or else it would be just an amusing but forgettable mystery.Perhaps the title is misleading: there's not a lot of "fright" in "Stage Fright." It's a modest but enjoyable movie that feels more akin to Hitchcock's low-budget British movies than his Hollywood spectaculars. As in "The Lady Vanishes," the heroine is a spunky brunette instead of a cool blonde; the hero (Detective Smith, played by Michael Wilding) is likable but not stereotypically "heroic" or dashing; and there are some good comic roles for British character actors. Alastair Sim and Sybil Thorndike are hilarious as Eve's crazy parents.Though Wyman is a bit too obviously American, she makes for an appealing heroine; it's especially fun when she has to switch between playing Eve and posing as the Cockney maid, Doris. There's a fascinating mash-up of talents at work when Charlotte sings "The Laziest Gal in Town": song by Cole Porter, husky vocals by Dietrich, costumes by Christian Dior, direction by Hitchcock. And though Dietrich's acting seems unconvincing at first?she's best as a cool and implacable diva, not a distraught widow?when you learn that the first scene was a lie, everything truly falls into place.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Second-rate Hitchcock, but that's not such a bad thing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The most famous thing about "Stage Fright" is without a doubt its final plot twist; having seen the film twice now, I can say that the twist almost holds up, but there is one scene, or more accurately one line, that cheats (Todd and Dietrich meet in her dressing room, alone, and she says the word "accident"). Two other characteristics of this movie are its brilliant camera work (especially at the start, when Todd goes into the house where the dead body is), and its well-written dialogue. Unfortunately, there is less of the former and more of the latter - the movie is overly talky. Jane Wyman appears to be bland at the start, but as the film goes on and she has to assume all these different identities, she gets better. Richard Todd is effective in his key scenes (the close-ups of his eyes at the finale). Michael Wilding is likable as the detective and Alastair Sim is delightfully dry as Wyman's father (at one point she says "I'll make her talk. It will be one woman to another". Sim's response: "Yes. An impressive situation at any time"). The one performance I didn't like was Marlene Dietrich's - it was old-fashioned even by 1950 standards. But maybe that's what Hitchcock had in mind.

		<shortDescription>The master of movie mysteries does it again</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My title may seem a little off-base since "Stage Fright" comes about in the middle of the nearly five decades that Alfred Hitchcock thrilled audiences with his films. But, whenever it was that one saw a Hitchcock film, we always had a sense of "Wow, he did it again." The again, of course, was his clever shooting, scripting, and direction that entertained and beguiled us while keeping us in the dark about many parts of the film and its outcome.One could have fun with lots of "m's" ? as in mayhem and murder -- to describe Hitchcock movies. But we should remember that Hitch also did some comedies and romance. While he wasn't known for those, I think they give us a little hint about the subtle humor that he likes to weave into some of his stories. Not all, but some. Including his cameo shots in almost all of his mystery films. "Stage Fright" has a touch of comedy in the dialogue, and more in the mannerisms of one of the main characters ? Commodore Gill, played by Alastair Sim (as the credits note, billed as "Alistair" Sim). Sim will forever be known to movie fans as Ebenezer Scrooge from the 1951 filming of Charles Dickens' "A Christmas Carol." And although he did have some serious roles in earlier mysteries and dramas, Sim was very successful the last half of his career with comedies. In "Stage Fright," Commodore Gill's wit and light-hearted manner gives a sense of calm to contrast the high tension of Jane Wyman's Eve Gill. Wyman excels in her role, and the other main characters are all very good. Marlene Dietrich is not the star of this film, but she has a main role of suspicion that she carries us along with very nicely. Richard Todd's Jonathan Cooper is very good, and Michael Wilding, Sybil Thorndike and Kay Walsh are excellent as Ordinary Smith, Mrs. Gill and Nellie Goode, respectively.I won't discuss the plot, because I think that reveals too much and the suspense is a big part of the enjoyment of these films. Suffice it to say that "Hitch has done it again." He dazzled movie goers for more than four decades with many of the best crime mysteries ever put on film. No one could do them better. And, while he did receive five Academy Award nominations, he never did win an Oscar. This is one of those uncanny things about Hollywood, the movie industry and the Oscars. Films that Hitch directed received nearly 50 Academy Award nominations. They won six Oscars and two Golden Globes ? for others. And, if nothing else, Hitchcock was one of the most successful movie directors in the U.S. and England. Most of his films from the 1930s through 1960s were huge box-office successes. Many big name stars appeared in Hitch films ? some in more than one. Cary Grant, James Stewart, Gregory Peck, Laurence Olivier, Sean Connery, Peter Lorre, Charles Laughton, Claude Rains, Paul Newman, Henry Fonda, Rod Taylor, James Mason, Raymond Burr, Ray Milland, Robert Cummings, Montgomery Clift, Joel McCrea, Karl Malden, Joseph Cotton, George Sanders, and Robert Donat had some of the male leads. Ingrid Bergman, Julie Andrews, Janet Leigh, Carole Lombard, Maureen O'Hara, Joan Fontaine, Diane Baker, Doris Day, Anne Baxter, Kim Novak, Eva Marie Saint, Shirley MacLaine, Grace Kelly, and Laraine Day were among the female leads.At the time of my writing this review in January, 2014, nine of Alfred Hitchcock's films are among the top 250 rated movies on the IMDb list. "Rear Window" from 1954 is IMDb number 30, followed by "Psycho" from 1960 at number 31. "North by Northwest" from 1959 is ranked 57; "Vertigo" from 1958 is 67; "Rebecca" from 1940 is 134; and "Dial M for Murder" from 1954 is 168. The last three are "Strangers on a Train," 1950, at number 186; "Notorious," 1946, at 191; and "Rope" from 1948 at number 240. Is there another director who has more than nine films in the top 250 IMDb list in early January, 2014?Viewers may note that "Birds" from 1963 isn't on the IMDb top-250 list. Nor is "Lifeboat," long-considered one of the great movies of all time since it came out in 1944, smack dab at the height of World War II. Or, how about "Spellbound" from 1945? Or, "The 39 Steps" from 1935? Or, "Marnie" from 1964? Indeed, the list of great films by Hitchcock goes on and on. Most are mysteries, but some are romance and comedies. I recommend the above films to younger viewers who may want to see more of Hitchcock. And, the following list is sure to provide many more hours of movie enjoyment. "The Man Who Knew Too Much," 1934; "Secret Agent," 1936; "Sabotage," 1936; "The Girl Was Young," 1937; "The Lady Vanishes," 1938; "Jamaica Inn," 1939; "Foreign Correspondent," 1930; "Suspicion," 1941; "Saboteur," 1942; "Shadow of a Doubt," 1943; "I Confess," 1953; "To Catch a Thief," 1955; "The Troubles with Harry," 1955; "The Wrong Man," 1956; "Torn Curtain," 1966; and "Frenzy," 1972.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining, Gripping, Slightly Off-The-Wall, Mid-Period Hitchcock Thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Eve is in love with Jonathan. When he tells her that the famous actress Charlotte Inwood has killed her husband and he has covered up the crime, Eve helps him hide and poses as Charlotte's dresser to try and prove his innocence. Things get complicated however when Eve falls for the detective investigating, and Jonathan's story starts to unravel ?Between his workman forties period and his fifties American masterpieces, Hitch briefly returned to Britain to make two good-but-not-great flicks, Under Capricorn and this film. Written by Whitfield Cook and Alma Reville, based on a book by Selwyn Jepson, it's a slightly over-involved tale with a large weak spot; Eve is hopelessly enough in love with Jonathan to be an accomplice to murder, but then suddenly drops him halfway through the plot in favour of Inspector Smith after knowing him for about ten minutes. However, it more than makes up for this with plenty of funny/sinister supporting characters, a great MacGuffin in the form of a bloody dress and a creepily psychotic twist in the tail. Most of all though what appeals about the film is the extremely strange cast; American Wyman somehow keeps a straight face, Sim and Thorndike are both hilarious as her loony-toon parents, Wilding and Todd are typical saps, and Walsh - one of the best British actresses of her day (This Happy Breed, Oliver Twist) - is fabulous as the chiselling Nellie Goode. Add to this strange brew the still fabulously smoking Dietrich doing her classic Lili Von Shtupp conniving femme fatale act and you have a truly unique mix. Even the bit parts are full of up-and-coming great players, notably iconic revue artist Grenfell as the lady running the duck-shooting sideshow. If one criticism can be levelled at the film, it's that the tone is a little uneven. The scenes with Todd are taut and gripping whilst the ones with Sim are quaint and ridiculous; Hitchcock often brings off this horror/humour combo well, but it drifts a little here. Nonetheless it's quality entertainment throughout, and if nothing else, watch this to see Dietrich singing I'm The Laziest Gal In Town, the closest thing to a musical number as Sir Alfred ever got in his illustrious career.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Underrated Hitchcock classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to say I am slightly puzzled as to why 'Stage Fright' is not generally considered one of Alfred Hitchcocks' finest works, as on every viewing I remain glued to the screen right the way from beginning to end.The film opens with a theatre curtain rising and we are immediately introduced to a postwar London still containing the ruins of World War Two. Eve (Jane Wyman), a Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts actress is driving Johnny (Richard Todd) who has run from away from the scene of the murder of the husband of Charlotte (Marlene Dietrich), a major star of the theatre. "Any sign of the police?" she asks him as they escape. "Eve, do you hate me now you know about me and Charlotte?" Johnny asks her. Eve regards Charlotte as "cold and calculating", and is convinced that she is using Johnnys' affections towards her to get him convicted of the murder. From here until very late in the picture, Eve does all she can to prevent Johnny from being convicted of a crime she is sure Charlotte has committed.As the film progresses there are plenty of indications as to who might have done the crime, but it takes a dramatic twist towards the end of the picture for us to discover who out of Johnny and Charlotte is actually guilty. The conclusion very much goes against what we are led to believe for much of the films' running time due to an early flashback, something which Hitchcock apparently regretted. In my opinion this makes the movie hugely interesting and somewhat unique.The other reasons for me liking this picture are plenty. The attractive Jane Wyman as Eve is outstanding in the lead role, whilst Marlene Dietrich steals much of the limelight, notably when she performs the song 'The Laziest Girl in Town' surrounded by smartly dressed men. Alistair Sim is very charismatic as Eves' father who goes out of his way to try to get Charlotte to confess, even using a doll with a bloodstained dress to unnerve her whilst she performs at a wet garden party ("What vermin some vermin are" Charlotte remarks). Charlotte suffers from 'Stage Fright' in front of an audience when she is presented with the doll, and is a fascinating character who uses her acting skills to get herself out of tricky situations in real life. Eve turns the tables on Charlotte by posing as her dresser and when she reveals her true identity a horrified Charlotte tells her, "I'll give you anything if you keep me out of this." The film harks back to Hitchcocks' origins as it contains many quintessentially British characters, notably Eves' parents and Charlottes' maid, and it is set in London which is where many of his early British films from the 1920's and 1930's took place. One notably British location is a pub where Eve meets the police detective Smith (Michael Wilding), who takes quite a fancy to her.Overall, I think this is an excellent picture and very worthwhile viewing for all Hitchcock fans.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Less known than other Hitchcock films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alfred Hitchcock's "Stage Fright" is less well known than his other films of this era (the film was made in 1950). However, it's very entertaining and quite good, starring Marlene Dietrich, Jane Wyman, Michael Wilding, Richard Todd, Alistair Sim and Sybil Thorndike. Set in the atmosphere of London theater, Dietrich plays Charlotte, a stage star whose husband is murdered in their house. She begs her boyfriend Jonathan (Todd) to help her, as she is certain she will be accused. Worse, she has blood on her dress. Jonathan takes the dress and goes to Charlotte's home to get her another one. However, on the way out, the maid sees him. He panics, Charlotte panics, and Jonathan takes off with the aide of a young actress (Wyman) who's in love with him. She takes him to her father's (Sims) boat so he can hide out. She returns to London and finds out that indeed, Jonathan is the prime suspect. She meets a detective on the case named Smith (Wilding), and the two start falling for one another. He doesn't know that Eve is now living a double life as herself and that of Charlotte's dresser Doris in order to get information."Stage Fright" moves quickly, and the characters are wonderful. Dietrich is beautiful in her Dior outfits and as Charlotte, she is completely self-involved, calling "Doris" Elsie and every other name except Doris. She wants her widow's weeds cut lower in the front and plans on attending a garden party right after her husband's funeral. Wyman is very good, though she doesn't use an English accent. As Doris, though, she has a very serviceable Cockney. Michael Wilding is handsome and charming as Detective Smith, and Richard Todd as Jonathan is obsessed as well as frightened. Alistair Sim is hilarious as Eve's father, an excellent portrayal of an eccentric man, and Sybil Thorndike is very funny as Eve's airhead of a mother.Dietrich sings several numbers in her inimitable style, and a very young Pat Hitchcock plays a young actress friend of Eve's. All in all, a good movie. Not Hitchcock's best maybe, but certainly better (as far as I'm concerned) than "I Confess."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Without going into details, director Alfred Hitchcock's "Stage Fright" does something with a character's "point-of-view" that fatally flaws the film. By the last act, it will be obvious. It's surprising that so adept a director would "cheat" so ineffectively; especially, when the technique can (and has) be done so well elsewhere. Possibly, Mr. Hitchcock is deliberately misleading the viewer, when he should be ambiguous. The picture is, otherwise, enjoyable. Wilkie Cooper's camera performs expertly.The cast, individually wonderful, never convincingly comes together. For example, it's difficult to believe Jane Wyman (as Eve Gill) is the daughter of Alistair Sim (as Commodore Gill) and Sybil Thorndike (as Mrs. Gill). Still, Mr. Sim and Ms. Thorndike provide for a wealth of dry Hitchcock humor. Ms. Wyman and Marlene Dietrich (as Charlotte Inwood) are, of course, a treat; and, they make the romantic entanglements as believable as possible. Leading men Richard Todd (as Jonathan "Johnny" Cooper) and Michael Wilding (as Wilfred "Ordinary" Smith) do their best opposite strong women and, especially in Mr. Todd's case, an unsure storyline. Kay Walsh (as Nellie Goode) leads the pack of smaller, delightful Hitchcock characters.****** Stage Fright (2/23/50) Alfred Hitchcock ~ Jane Wyman, Marlene Dietrich, Richard Todd, Michael Wilding</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Surely not one among Hitchock's most discussed films, STAGE FRIGHT stands out as a "wild accumulation of clever or colorful episodes" rather than "wild accumulation of tension" (Bosley Crowther, New York Times, February 1950). Indeed, STAGE FRIGHT does not occur to display any striking resemblance to more popular fantasy products by the Master of Suspense and, strangely enough, his famous hallmark, the MacGuffin, actually remains offstage. Carter B. Horsley rightly observed once that "Hitchcock had a wickedly delicious sense of humor and was a master manipulator of his audiences with unexpected dramatics in spectacular locations." It seems that this line finds its clearest resemblance in this film which proves to balance the real with the stylized, occurs to transmute a melodrama into real life where, specifically, Hitchcock and old England are doing darn well...and...lots of our assumptions give way to the unique fantasy of linguistic and cinematic 'manipulation.' With the lovely camera ankle of 'entrance into apartment' viewers enter a slightly different world by Hitchock, yet equally entertaining and memorable. Flashbacks are there to tell lies, the images of ruined London serve to correspond to specific period challenges, the English characters spy or are accused while the German ones sing, the psychology of characters seem to deceive us all the way through but one thing is certain: the show goes on with a very specific aspect where 'some fear' is placed: the stage. Terribly theatrical context but isn't that so much British? Traditionally British? Therefore, I would like to focus on three points of this "helter-skelter" movie, as Bosley Crowther names it in his review: the cast, old England and humor.THE CAST: One of the film's major strengths is its delightful bunch of British cast. As a relatively newcomer at Hitchcock, JANE WYMAN, is the director's unique female discovery. From the start of the film, she somehow manages to call our attention, we empathize with her and, in the long run, she constitutes, for us, a perfect model of 'make-belive.' There is innocence and inexperience blended in her. One of the most powerful scenes that she handles is the bar moment where she leads audiences to certain tension but does not let us be absorbed by it completely. She looks desperate, as humorous Mr Fortesque notes, but surprises us with later reactions. That anticipates, and rightly so, her major skill in this performance, to evoke emotions constantly keeping the borderline, the limit to what place it is safe to go and which point we actually cannot cross. Also great job as one Doris Tinsdale and a dresser of extravagant Charlotte.MICHAEL WILDING, a very eminent actor of the times, with his role does not only serve to portray an 'Agatha-Christie' like detective but beautifully combines the wits, charm, and determination creating a unique, non-verbal interaction with various audiences. Finally, he is the one who falls in love. His moment is the car scene with Eve. The performance of RICHARD TODD, the actor of Irish origin does occur a bit shadowed by others. STAGE FRIGHT does not ignore, among the supporting performers, the elderly couple (who are usually the parents of a protagonist) and so they are here: ALISTAIR SIM as calm and peaceful Mr Gill and SYBIL THORNDYKE as his rigid, demanding wife.As she is a strict mother of more or less Victorian style, he is a very sympathetic, hilarious (at moments) daddy who is afraid for his daughter knowing that 'in real life you have to face situations with all its bearings.' He is a very likable old gentleman, at the same time, resorting to more peaceful way of life and one of the most frank of all Hitchcock's supporting characters. Crowther nicely refers to Sim's performance saying that: "the privilege of watching him muster his wits and resources to assist his daughter in her endeavors is one of the genuine pleasures of the film." Sim and Thorndyke paired together, they powerfully manifest the director's own believes about elderly couples within traditional conventions of a family life. And, obviously, Hitchock's daughter Patricia in the supporting role.Of course, among the cast, there is one exception from 'the British' yet, the one loved by the British public: MARLENE DIETRICH. It simply takes her that way and some people see the film solely for the sake of her presence. Yes, as 'the Laziest Gal in Town' with specific sexy laziness that only Marlene was capable of handling on the screen, she reveals the flamboyant and yet predictable aspect of her character, Charlotte. Her glamor goes with her terrific impact on characters around and audiences alike with, indeed, some other unforgettable climaxes than the song she sang for Hitchcock (and sang once more in Denver). She embodies sex with power, extravagance with manipulation, beauty with price.OLD ENGLAND: Along with the title and the locations, Hitchcock highlights something significant that may but does not necessarily remain in the background: peaceful, idyllic England that is forever gone with the old generation. We don't have haunting castles, some ghastly removed spots, foggy atmosphere and other clichs of the sort but a garden party, old cafs, theater basically ruled by classical approach, gentlemen of the old style and the post-war London where ruins also stand for social situation of the time. In this way, the film is 'dazzlingly stagy...far from frightening' (Crowther) but very pleasant to watch. And the last aspect:HUMOR is ever-present from the lovely scene of Doris Tinsdale in glasses through Hitchcock's cameo presence, Mr and Mrs Gill's tense interactions, some of Ordinary Smith's lines to the dark wit (for the time) expressed in Charlotte's line "I hate rainy funerals." Many clever lines make the film witty in an intelligent manner.STAGE FRIGHT is undeniably a movie worth seeing, another of Hitchock's powerful productions though it might not look like one. Worth seeing!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Last Great Undiscovered Hitchcock</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"All the world's a stage, and all the men and women merely players..." The films of Alfred Hitchcock often gave light to Shakespeare's famous line, but none more than this, a film dedicated to the theatrical art where no one is exactly what he or she seems.This includes Hitchcock himself, who seems to be directing a Douglas Sirk romantic melodrama one minute (including one of Sirk's leading ladies, Jane Wyman, in the starring role), and "The 39 Steps" the next. "Stage Fright" is a problematic film for many on account of a rather diabolical switch Hitch pulls near the film's end, but like the playful genre-bending, this can be seen as a witty way of working against the grain. Anyway, I dug it.Wyman is Eve Gill, an aspiring actress who takes on the role of her life trying to save the man of her dreams, Jonathan Cooper (Richard Todd) from being convicted of a murder he didn't commit. Disguising herself as a replacement maid, she digs around at the scene of the crime while working a budding romance with a police inspector (Michael Wilding) investigating the case. Is she just playing a role, or becoming the part?This is the theme. What gives "Stage Fright" its lasting sparkle are two other performances. Marlene Dietrich is Charlotte, the stage star Eve tries to unmask as the real culprit, slinking her way from one scene to the next with smoky charm, playing up her false emotions for maximum comic effect. She's thoroughly awful but hard not to like, in that mordant way Hitchcock employed with his great villains. "I hope you're not going to turn into one of those explicit people who tell you exactly how they feel when you ask them," she purrs.On the other side of the coin is Alistair Sim as Eve's rascally father. He seems the one person who knows what is going on. Early on he chides Eve about "transmuting melodrama into real life" and throughout the film acts the role of her tut-tutting stage manager, enabling her performance as best he can even if he knows she's better off going to the police.That's something a lot of Hitchcock experts can't forgive "Stage Fright" for, beyond the flashback question: It's the one time the police are not the fly in the ointment. Wilding's not only playing a good guy, but one with the right handle on this case. Compare that with other Hitchcock films, where the police are forever on the wrong trail and an impediment to justice.Wyman was a strange choice for lead actress, playing an English woman with no hint of an accent, but she garners the same kind of empathy she would working for Sirk on "Magnificent Obsession" and keeps us on her side even as we question her loyalty to Jonathan. Hitchcock takes a real chance with the flashback structurally, starting it 30 seconds into the film proper. I'm not sure why the film seems so badly dubbed at times, and why the action is so awkwardly blocked (at one point we see Wyman delivering a line while staring at the back of her head).All in all, I really like "Stage Fright" and can't understand the lingering hostility. It's not at all a heavy or serious film, but no breezy canter either, like say "Rear Window" or "North By Northwest". It puts us in a not-quite-quaint setting (London in springtime, yes, but also bearing open scars from the Blitz) and lets us deal with all that comes.Part of the pleasure is not knowing what is going to happen next, whether a sudden psychotic turn by a major character or merry Joyce Grenfell soliciting Sim out of the blue to have a shot at "the lovely ducks". Part of it is Hitchcock having fun with the theme of artifice and who's fooling who. And part of it is just watching some good actors playing roles within roles, and perhaps joining Sim in offering a silent round of applause when it's all over.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hitchcock at his most enjoyable ... and under-rated.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alfred Hitchcock made this highly enjoyable and under-rated divertissment in 1950 after a run of glum movies in the second half of the forties but before embarking on his richest period in the fifties. It also brought him back to Britain for a very old-fashioned comedy-thriller that wouldn't have looked out of place among his thirties' thrillers. It's also the one with the twist that turns out to be Hitchcock 'cheating' or, shall we say, breaking the rules and detractors of the movie haven't forgiven for it. There is also no flab in the movie whatsoever; it kicks off with a murder and subsequently develops into a good old chase yarn.The principal parts are taken by Jane Wyman, cast against type and underplaying nicely, and Marlene Dietrich in one of her theatrical grande-dame roles, (in this one she sings 'The laziest gal in town'). The men are slightly frenetic Richard Todd and a bland Michael Wilding but it is the supporting cast of marvelous British character players who are the best value and give the film its bounce. We have Alastair Sim and Sybil Thorndike, Kay Walsh and Joyce Grenfell and a wonderfully sleazy turn from an unlikely Miles Malleson. Set-pieces are few, (the doll at the Garden Fete is one of them), but as I've said, this was a divertissment and very good fun it is, too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Great Man's Weaker Efforts</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although Alfred Hitchcock left Britain for Hollywood in 1940, he occasionally returned to make films in his native country, the best-known probably being his penultimate film "Frenzy". "Stage Fright" was one of two films he made in Britain in 1949/50, the other being "Under Capricorn". As a number of other reviewers have pointed out, it is one of Hitchcock's least-know films; indeed, until recently it was the only one of his films, other than some of his early British pictures, that I had never seen.Although the film was made in Britain, Hitchcock clearly felt he needed some international stars to give it greater box-office appeal abroad, hence the presence of Jane Wyman and Marlene Dietrich. Wyman is today perhaps best known as the first Mrs Ronald Reagan, and hence the only woman in American history to lose through divorce the chance to become First Lady, but in the fifties she was regarded as a major star. Although Eve is supposed to be British, a story is invented to explain her American accent, but no similar explanation is given for Dietrich's German one.The film starts with a striking beginning in medias res. A young man and young woman are in a car, and it is clear from the dialogue that they are on the run from the police, having (or so we are led to presume) committed a crime. The earlier story is then told in flashback. The man is Jonathan Cooper, an actor and the lover of the famous stage actress Charlotte Inwood. (The film's title is a reference to its setting in the world of the theatre). He claims that Charlotte killed her husband in an argument and that he tried to assist her in covering up the deed, only to bring suspicion upon himself. He is now on the run, wanted by the police. The woman in the car is Jonathan's former girlfriend Eve Gill, who has agreed to help him escape. Eve suspects that Jonathan might have been framed by Charlotte and, disguised as a maid, infiltrates Charlotte's household to investigate.By 1950 it was already an established convention in Alfred Hitchcock films that whenever a young man is suspected of a crime he is in reality innocent. (Examples include the characters played by Robert Donat in "The 39 Steps", Robert Cummings in "Saboteur" and Gregory Peck in "Spellbound"). In "Stage Fright", however, Hitchcock reverses this convention; at the end of the film it turns out that Jonathan is indeed guilty of the murder. Today a revelation that a character believed to be innocent is in fact as guilty as hell is a banal commonplace in "twist" thrillers, but in the early fifties there was a convention that flashbacks should always reflect the true situation, and Hitchcock was criticised in some quarters for a "lying flashback" which misleads the audience by presenting them not with the truth but with Jonathan's false story.There are, in fact, a few hints that Hitchcock was preparing a surprise for his audience. If this were a standard Hitchcock movie, Jonathan would take the lead in proving his innocence, with Eve as his loyal helpmate, and by the end of the film their romance would have been rekindled. Here, however, Jonathan fades out of the action in the central part of the film, and it is Eve who takes the leading role. (This is one of the minority of Hitchcock films- "Shadow of a Doubt" is another- with a woman at its centre). Moreover, a romance develops between Eve and Inspector Wilfred Smith, the detective in charge of the murder investigation. (Another unusual feature- although most of Hitchcock's films deal with crime, individual police officers rarely play a leading role).With a number of original features, this could have been one of the director's best films, but it misses out on that distinction. The acting is generally competently done, but there are no really outstanding contributions apart from Dietrich (who probably didn't need to try very hard in order to portray a sexually predatory actress). The main reason why the film is a relative failure is that it lacks both the great directorial set-pieces which we have come to think of as a Hitchcock hallmark and the sense of tension which pervades his greatest films. Eve's attempts to trap Charlotte into a confession are grotesque and unbelievable. Even the final scene, in which Eve is threatened by Jonathan, is rather perfunctorily done. In his lighter films Hitchcock could make very effective use of humour (such as the political meeting in "The 39 Steps" or the auction scene in "North by North West"), but here his attempts to be humorous, such as the scene between Alastair Sim and Joyce Grenfell in the shooting alley, slow down and detract from the film rather than adding to it.There is also an untidy loose end relating to Charlotte, who is one Hitchcock character who actually gets away with murder. We learn that she incited Jonathan to kill her husband, which in the Britain of 1950 could have earned her a death sentence, but any evidence against her vanishes with Jonathan's death at the end of the film. (She has, at most, confessed to assisting Jonathan after the murder, which would not have been a capital offence). Overall, "Stage Fright" is one of the great man's weaker efforts. Fortunately, he returned to form back in Hollywood with "Strangers on a Train". 5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nancy Drew Meets Bijou Blanche</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before sitting down to write this review I took a look at the Films of Alfred Hitchcock Citadel book. One of the reviewers was quoted as saying that the frumpy character that Jane Wyman played when she was pretending to be Marlene Dietrich's maid came off like an adult's version of Nancy Drew. I remember Ms. Drew whether played by Bonita Granville or Pamela Sue Martin had a better sense of style than Wyman's character. But I really thought it said everything about the film.I'm still trying to figure out why she is going to all that trouble to help two timing Richard Todd. That's how the film opens, a fleeing Todd comes to girl friend Wyman and says he's about to be implicated in the murder of Dietrich's husband. And of course he confesses to Wyman that he's been unfaithful.Well instead of giving Todd the heave ho, she agrees to help and gets herself involved in the Scotland Yard investigation. Good thing that police inspector Michael Wilding falls for Wyman otherwise he'd be arresting her for tampering with evidence and obstruction of justice. Presumably those are criminal offenses in the United Kingdom as well as America.What saves Stage Fright from being a total disaster is Marlene Dietrich. She essentially plays herself as musical comedy star Charlotte Inwood and gets to sing La Vie En Rose and Cole Porter's The Laziest Gal in Town. According to a recent biography of Dietrich she and Alfred Hitchcock had an unbelievable time trying to agree on what she should sing. She rejected The Laziest Gal In Town among dozens of others and she finally agreed at the last minute to sing that song. Of course it became a big hit and a staple in her nightclub act for decades.Another thing I can't understand is why Wyman was identified in the script as having been born in South Africa. She certainly doesn't sound like any South African I've met. Why they couldn't use the old standby of Canadian origin for American players in British based films is beyond me.Alfred Hitchcock definitely hit a creative snag in Stage Fright. I'm not sure devotees of the master of suspense will like this one.But Dietrich fans will love it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Watchable Hitchcock, but it could have been better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The plot of "Stage Fright" involves a man (Richard Todd) being wrongly accused of the murder of the husband of his actress lover Charlotte Inwood (Marlene Dietrich), his escape from law, and with the help of a struggling young actress named Eve (Jane Wyman), the clearing of his name.The wrong man theme has been done by Hitchcock before (39 Steps) and after this movie (The Wrong Man, North By Northwest), and to better effect - but the key difference here is the ending revelation that he did in fact commit the murder, and not just happen upon the body.This ending plot twist, and the opening, near silent scene where Richard Todd's character gets caught at the scene of the crime by the maid and then gets chased by the police, provide much of the thrills for the movie. The latter in particular shows off some great camera work and visual storytelling, showing the lead character's anxiety and fear of being caught.In between, the film plods with a romance plot between Eve and a detective trying to solve the case (Michael Wilding), some average Marlene Dietrich performances, and Eve pretending to be Charlotte's maid so that she can find out more about what really happened.Blackmail and fear of being found out to be harboring a wanted man is what makes up the middle portion of the movie, with Eve nearly being caught out by the detective several times, or by Charlotte's actual maid who realizes that she isn't a reporter, and then blackmails her to keep quiet.My problem these scenes aren't very suspenseful at all, and the movie, while watchable, is a bit of a slog to sit through - with Hitch's direction being a bit conventional for most of the movie.It's well enough to sit through once, but I don't think I would see it again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Eve Gill (Wyman) attempts to help her friend Jonathan Cooper (Todd) who has assisted his lover, high actress Charlotte Inwood (Dietrich), in covering up a brutal murder.This mystery drama from Alfred Hitchcock deceives audiences in true Hitchcock style as we see numerous characters all come together to see an unravelling of a brutal murder.Opening with Eve and Cooper in a car driving to escape Cooper recollects the events of his desperate escape in a flashback that adds extra drama to an already tense notion.Marlene Dietrich's protagonist, an echo of Gloria Swanson's Norma Desmond, is desperately trying to resolve her frustration and sadness onto her lover in Cooper's apartment. From here a whole case of murder mystery and criminal ideologies unfold in an appreciation of the director.Alfred Hitchcock the master of suspense once more cracks his whip and we have a subtle stage of deception with an exceptionally authentic recollection on screen. The flashback sequences are some highlights but his most joyous moments come when we see the character's minds working away. For instance Todd's wide-eyed horror of the truth coming out, Alistair Sim's realization of exploration with the blood concept are brilliantly executed to their best ability. This is a sensual example of character development over injustice and wrong doings.The problem with this film however is that there are quite a hoard of protagonists and we must constantly work away our own minds to everyone's own personal agenda and situation, which kind of spoils the point.With the suspense being built through sudden shocking murders the constant downswing evaporates the script's full potential. One major example would be that after a murder at the theatre Eve ends up meeting Original Smith and the two start to flirt and skirt around what's really important, the events at the theatre. There are numerous moments of placement which are just not justification of what should be.So whilst the inconsistency is a shadow there is still a bright side to this film in that it is enjoyable and exciting and Hitchcock is on form once more. That sequence with the shoot out and dolls is brilliant and adds a spice of comedy, with numerous other scenes doing similarly.Richard Todd is brilliant as Cooper, being wide eyed and cowardly enough to get the right message across. Michael Wilding adds the right charm and sophistication to proceedings, even if this romantic sub story could have been removed. Dietrich is good as a fame addict but simply not on scale with Swanson and the main actress in Jane Wyman is too flappable and uninteresting to generate a full execution of desperation.This is a fast moving well placed mystery that has great moments of comedy and drama and though there are factors that could have been rethought this is worth watching.</fullReview>

I admit that has some boring parts but you must accept that the plot is really good. Also the cast. Jane Wyman and Marlene Dietrich on the featuring roles. I think that this film is really about the things that may come up, when you act according to just one person's side of the story and you believe it without having any proof. It may not be Oscar material but is indeed very thrilling. Marlene Dietrich looks great as a widow who hides a secret and "apparently" intends to throw everything on someone else.

		<fullReview>According to reports, Alfred Hitchcock was apologetic for the opening sequence of "Stage Fright." With all due respect to the double-chinned master, he's wrong. The scene puts a nifty twist in what might otherwise have been a predictable plot. I'll say no more rather than risk a spoiler alert and go on to the cast, led by a gallery of great British character actors. Alistair Sim is a scenery-chewing, rum-smuggling delight as the puckish father of Jane Wyman, a man who loves but cannot live with his wife, the ditzy Dame Sybil Thorndyke. Then there's hollow-eyed Richard Todd as an accused killer on the run, Kathy Walsh as a slatternly maid-cum-blackmailer, old Miles Malleson as a pub busybody and even Michael Wilding as a detective who's insouciance suffers a severe setback when he shares a cab ride with Wyman. "Stage Fright" may not be as complex as "Psycho" or "Strangers on the Train" but it's fast-moving, frequently surprising fun...and well worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very suspenseful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Stage Fright" is seldom included in any short list of Hitchcock's best films. Maybe it shouldn't be, but it is suspenseful enough, and the acting is good enough. The reason for its lack of popularity is most likely due to its cast. Except for Marlene Dietrich (who shines as a manipulative diva), the others do not possess the star power on display in such films as "Notorious" or "Rear Window" - at least in the United States.It is possible to take away from this film a very cynical attitude toward love, and its effect on people. Eve (Jane Wyman) loves Jonathan (Richard Todd). He doesn't love her, but he uses her to escape from the police. Because she loves him, she believes everything he tells her about his innocence. Jonathan loves Charlotte (Dietrich). She doesn't love him, but she pretends to, in order to get the man she really wants, Freddie. A sad state of affairs (no pun intended), but it has the ingredients for a terrific suspense film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Who would have believed it - a boring film from Hitchcock?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first saw this one some years ago and thought it was pretty mediocre then. I recently 'gave it another chance', hoping that I had got it wrong the first time around. I am afraid my verdict is that I did not and that this is simply a dull film with very little indeed going for it. Hitch's contempt for plot lines was well known but his visual pyrotechnics and complete mastery of film-making usually outweighed this and made the audience completely forget the tissue-thin nature of the 'plot' (think of 'The Birds'!) Here there are very few interesting or innovative cinematic qualities to enjoy at all as the plot unfolds like an old and creaking Russian doll opening up its various 'chapters'. I also found the acting of ALL the principal players wanting; Jane Wyman's qualities are ones I have never really appreciated, I must admit, Richard Todd is hopeless after the very first scenes, even the divine Dietrich seems to be 'just going through the motions' and, saddest of all, even Alastair Sim, who could usually raise a piece of froth like 'The Green Man' into something like a minor film classic, just does not have the material or setting to make a mark either. Overall conclusions: like any master in virtually any field, even Hitchcock definitely had some duds on his record card as well and, personally, I very much doubt if there will be a third viewing on my part. Re-watching 'The 39 Steps', 'North by North West', 'Psycho' etc. etc. would be a MUCH better way of spending 90 minutes or so!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stage Fright- Was Jane Intimidated by Marlene Here? **1/2</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After viewing this film, I was wondering if Jane Wyman was intimidated by the fact that she co-starred with Marlene Dietrich in this 1950 Hitcock film. It sure appeared that way to me in the scenes with these two ladies, despite the fact that Wyman had already copped an Oscar 2 years before for "Johnny Belinda."The interesting performance in this film is that of Richard Todd. It's interesting to view his innocence at the beginning literally turn into a maniacal performance of being first rate.How convenient that the woman he loved, Wyman, would instead turn her attention to Michael Wilding, the investigator of the murder case. You know there is more to it than Dietrich turning the tables on Todd. In a way, it reminded me of the complicity of Dietrich with Tyrone Power, 8 years later in "Witness for the Prosecution."Nonetheless, the film is an interesting one. We can say by film's end that the curtain literally comes down on Todd.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to admit that the ending of this Hitchcock film surprised me.I am usually pretty good at picking up clues but I missed 2 large ones in this film.The first is the story told by the murderer, I believed it. The story was told in flashback, it may be a lie. I have seen most of the Hitchcock films and the innocent are virtually always just that, innocent. It just didn't occur to me that the story might be a lie.The second clue is the fact that the heroine fell out of love with the murderer and into love with the detective. This should have clinched it for me but I missed the meaning completely. Heroines do not fall out of love with heroes, unless there is a very good reason.This film is a bit subdued due to the fact that the murderer could not give himself away until the end. I thought that it could have had a more intense climax when his guilt was revealed.I give it 9 out of 10 due to fact that it surprised me.</fullReview>

While it's certainly not one of Hithcocks best, it have a few scenes that is just wonderful, and characters. The Laziest Gal in Town, Marlene Dietrich does what she does best, singing a torch song, but she's very good as the spoilt superstar. (She made another movie in Britain with James Stewart and Glynis Johns in 1951) Jane Wyman reminded me of Margaret Lockwood in The Lady Vanishes, as the lady in distress who for no reason actually want's to solve a crime. OK she was somehow involved by heart to Richard Todd. Richard Todd was the man on the run, seen him in a few Disney movies of the 50s so I guess he was the star for a while (He was in a movie with Bette Davis where she played Queen Elizabeth) Michael Wilding played the Police representative, meeting Jane coincidentaly in a bar, or not.... But 3 other names makes this delicious too! Alastair Sim, Dame Sibyl Thorndike and Joyce Grenfell.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Intrguing minor work from Hitchcock</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Stage Fright' is one of Hitchock's lesser-known efforts, and it is definitely not on a par with the finesse of a 'Notorious' or 'Vertigo, but it does have some interesting elements that make it a generally entertaining suspense film. Set in his native England, and revolving primarily around the stage, it's an altogether unusual work from the Master of Suspense.Jane Wyman is solid as Eve, the drama student, who goes undercover to help a friend who looks to be framed for murder. Her character is sympathetic and reminiscent of Teresa Wright's 'Charlie' in Hitchcock's earlier 'Shadow Of A Doubt' in that she is a plainer yet cluey brunette heroine. The great Alistair Sim is the stand-out here as Wyman's father, and he is the most charismatic of a rather dull bunch of characters. Both the male leads Wilding and Todd are average to good in their roles- they do what is required of them, but they are not up to the usual excellent performances that Hitch drew from his actors. Dietrich has an interesting character as the showy actress Charlotte Inwood. Dietrich's appeal is due to her star presence than a great acting talent, but she is eye-catching and looks fantastic for her age.This film has some severe problems with pacing. It starts off promising, with a high-speed car conversation, but then drifts back and forth from dull mediocrity to intriguing suspense. The romantic sub-plot between Wyman and Wilding is distracting and the pair lack credible chemistry. However, it serves it's purpose in the end and gives the film some humour. Kay Walsh and Alistair Sim provide most of the other humour in their roles, and Dietrich has her moments too.It was a nifty idea from Hitch to base a murder mystery within the confines of the stage, where, through 'acting', nothing is as it appears to be. The stage also gives Hitch a chance to showcase some of his snappy technique, with the final scene being neatly executed.Runs too long and gets very dry at points, yet 'Stage Fright'is an interesting Hitch film worthy of discussion.6/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Suspense and comedy combine in this refreshingly innocent and intriguing thriller.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The black and white cinematography is clear and crisp and architecturally sensual. Alfred Hitchcock makes his cameo appearances, and as usual it is interesting to anticipate where he will show up. This is a classic mystery thriller, but it has comedy and romance as well. The story is well-played out and fascinating to watch to the very end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stage Fright (1950) - Hitchcock at A Different Stage</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I found Stage Fright to be one of most Hitchcock's interesting films. After the failure of Hitchcock's previous films (The Paradine Case, Rope, and Under Capricorn), Hitchcock was given a small budget for Stage Fright. In audio interview with Truffaut, Hitchcock called Stage Fright "A Small Picture." But even in this small Hitchcock picture, I found several things interesting. I don't know if anyone noticed this. if you rewatch this film, then you will see that the characters are telling one lie after another from the beginning of the movie. And the story builds up based on lies. But we see exactly the opposite on the last part of the film. The last part builds up by revealing the truths - one after another. And when we enter into the last portion of the film, we reach to a point where we never expected the film to reach. But the audience is concerned about it, because of the suspense Hitchcock uses.I know Hitchcock felt guilty, because many critics told that lying flashback was a mistake. But I found it very interesting, because of several reasons.I believe "the audience" is a character in Hitchcock films. The function of the audience is to watch and wait while Hitchcock intensifies their role by using suspense in the film. Let me give an example. A Suspense Scene from the film "Rope." Its the suspense scene where Mrs. Wilson clears the things on the chest to put the books inside the chest. If we take a closer look, then we will realize that the audience will be the "only one" who will be "heavily" concerned about opening the chest in that suspense scene. Unlike Mrs. Wilson, all the other characters in the film aren't focusing on both Mrs. Wilson and the chest, because they are busy talking about David.When Jonathan is telling the flashback story (which he created) to Eve (Jane Wyman), he is not only giving a visual idea of the story to Eve, but also to the audience through his "viewpoint." We are not the only one who ended up believing his story. Eve believed his story too. So he ended up convincing both Eve and the audience. By traveling through Eve and her father (Alastair Sim), we watch and wait throughout the movie to find the solution. By the end, the audience feels cheated when they find out the truth. But to me, what the audience doesn't realize is that they were able to share a true moment of feeling with a character in the film. We are not the only ones who were cheated. Eve was also cheated too. Its one moment where a fictional character (Eve) and the audience share the same feeling - "They were deceived by Jonathan Cooper (Richard Todd)." But the moment we see the horrifying side of Jonathan Cooper, we can completely feel the horror that is going through Eve. Both the audience and Eve feel the true feeling of danger, because both audience and Eve shared the same experience throughout the movie which is the desperation to find the solution. But when both the audience and Eve finds the truth, they both feel and share true moments of horror. Its not just Eve who wants to get out of that horrifying situation, but also the audience wants her to get out of there.The story of the book "Outrun the Constable" also known as Man Running (the book Stage fright is based on) is very different. In the book, Freddie Williams is the killer. Jonathan Cooper in the book is innocent. In the book, Jonathan Cooper is called Jonathan Penrose. But Hitchcock always liked to make his own adaptation. Alfred Hitchcock entirely created this lying flashback for the film. From what I know of, One "main" reason why Hitchcock created this flashback was because of the main character's name "Eve." In the Bible, Eve was deceived by the serpent in the "beginning" days of mankind. In the film, Eve was deceived by Jonathan Cooper in the "beginning" of the film by telling the false story to her. Hitchcock always made Biblical references in his films.For Example, the line in Foreign Correspondent - "You cry peace, Fisher. Peace. And there was no peace." This line was borrowed from the book of Jeremiah. The another example is The Man Who Knew too Much (1956) - The gunman at Albert Hall (Reggie Nalder) looks at the villain, because he is wearing the uniform of priest. The gunman says at the villain "What does the old proverb says? A Wolf in Sheep's Clothing." A Wolf in Sheep's Clothing was borrowed from Gospel of Matthew in New Testament Bible.I want to post more information about Stage Fright. But I think it will be too long. I give this film 10 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Despite some clever twists, one of Hitch's lesser works...stagey contrivances and very little fright...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although STAGE FRIGHT is very watchable, it's clear by the time we reach the twist ending that it's not one of Alfred Hitchcock's greatest works. Nor does Jane Wyman convince us that she's the daughter of Alastair Sims and Dame Sybil Thorndike without a trace of a British accent.JANE WYMAN's naive actress wannabe isn't strong enough to carry the show, made up to be a drab little wren with no personality whatsoever. This is especially jarring when we have MARLENE DIETRICH acting up a storm in her best WITNESS FOR THE PROSECUTION sort of mode, overly glamorized as a grand stage actress who is trying to pin a murder on a presumably innocent man.There are other compensations in the cast, notably ALASTAIR SIM as Wyman's father who gets to deliver one of the film's better performances and, of course, RICHARD TODD as the accused man around whom the plot spins. Hitchcock is evidently having fun with the audience as he plays a trick that disguises the truth and leads to a conclusion best described as less than satisfactory.Hitch's loyal fans will no doubt find all of this quite acceptable as a movie to enjoy for whatever interest its mystery holds and whatever flaws the story has, but be warned that it certainly doesn't rank among his best works. The dialog is occasionally full of good one-liners, mostly uttered by Dietrich. "What are detectives? Just policemen with smaller feet." Hitchcock does make subtle use of humor throughout.Summing up: A lot of stagey contrivances with very little fright and a final scene that short changes the whole story with an inept ending. In short, a mixed bag.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not as good as other Hitchcock suspenses or mysteries, but has some appeal to dedicated fans. Jane Wyman plays a young drama student who utilizes her acting skills and takes on a false identity to solve a murder of a famed actress' husband. Supporting cast includes Alastair Sim, best known for his portrayal of Ebenezer Scrooge the following year, and veteran Marlene Dietrich singing "The Laziest Gal in Town." Thankfully, Mr. Hitchcock followed-up with one of his best works ever, "Strangers on a Train" the very next year. Rating of 3 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Back in Blighty, but a bit boring</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alfred Hitchcock was into the ten-year sag between "Rope" and "Vertigo" when he filmed a novel that reviewers had said would make suitable material for him. It feels more like an opened-out West End hit play, full of what the Master derided, in others' work, as 'photographs of people talking'. It lacks the pyrotechnical set pieces of his later chefs d'oeuvre, and is flat and commonplace in expository stretches of whodunnitry. Also, there is one narrative cheat which everyone knows by now but is no more pardonable for that, unless you think the whole shebang is too contrived for it to be marred thereby.Interest is maintained, just about, by a procession of oddball, mainly British, character players. They circle around the insipid central character of Jane Wyma's drama student, sleuthing after the real killer of Marlene's husband. Barely straying from a back-projected London with hints of the full-blown gorblimey anachronisms of 'Frenzy'-- Hitch was already remembering his native city more than reliving it-- the story unwinds leisurely. There are amusing but irrelevant pauses for Marlene's self-parodic 'Laziest Girl in Town' sashaying, and a jolly scene with the old firm, Alastair Sim and Joyce Grenfell ('You are sorry for the orphans, aren't you?') at a shooting range during a wet theatrical charity event; Hitch pastiches himself with a shot of umbrellas filling the screen as it rains, like 'Foreign Correspondent'.Ms Wyman had won an Oscar by proving she could Really Act as a raped deaf-mute in 'Johnny Belinda'. Understandably she wanted something lighter. So did Hitch after the nerve-wracking long takes and melodrama of 'Under Capricorn', which had lost a packet and ended his partnership with the Bernstein brothers of Granada. Jane's 'tewwibly Briddish' accent is not up to Paltrow's or Zellweger's, and she was not enough of a plain-Jane in clothes and makeup to satisfy her director-- at the garden party she's in full New Look. But her nervy, big-eyed, oddly simian prettiness gets her through the part of a drama student who infiltrates Marlene's dressing room: 'Doris' was 15 years younger than the soon-to-be-ex Mrs Ronald Reagan was in real life.There are other perversities in casting. Michael Wilding has to subdue his roguish Regency-buck charm as a plainclothes copper embarrassed by his Christian name; conversely, the stiff and sanctimonious Richard Todd (who had jerked tears co-starring with Jane's husband in 'The Hasty Heart') had to portray a charismatic possible killer. Hitch, Todd says, was pleased with the result, but the man himself later said 'the villain was a flop' and shot a lot of close-ups of his eyes, maybe because Todd's mouth and body are not the most expressive.The overall mood is frivolous and relaxed, but Hitch was not at his happiest in light, as opposed to black, comedy: 'Mr and Mrs Smith' for Selznick, with no crime or solution, had not been his best time in Hollywood, and the surname of Wilding's character might be considered ominous. As 'Waltzes from Vienna' showed, Hitch was not at home with song and dance numbers either. The backstage life of the posh theatre where Marlene performs has none of the atmosphere of the music hall in 'The 39 Steps'.With glimpses of Sybil Thorndike (as Wyman's heedlessly talkative mother) and Sim as her dad, both too old, plus Miles Malleson and with Kay Walsh moving into character roles, 'Stage Fright' cannot fail to be lively at times. But Marlene would be better served in the 1950s by two other major helmers who cast her against type in small but vivid appearances, in 'Witness for the Prosecution' and 'Touch of Evil'.Hitchcock did not work with these talents again and preferred, rightly, to write this one off. As Fritz Lang said of 'An American Guerilla in the Philippines', a director must eat. No doubt some film studies thesis is at this moment poised to discover a masterpiece in these faded reels... but no, not really.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Delightfully Naive</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In London, the aspirant actress Eve Gill (Jane Wyman) and her friend Jonathan Cooper (Richard Todd) are fleeing from the police in her car to her father's boat two hours far from the city. Eve has a crush on Jonathan that tells her that a couple of hours later, his mistress and actress Charlotte Inwood (Marlene Dietrich) had come to his apartment with her dress covered of gore and telling that she had killed her husband. Jonathan decided to go to her apartment to bring a new dress for Charlotte, but her maid saw him in the crime scene and called the police that are chasing him as prime suspect. Eve's father Commodore Gill (Alistair Sim) lodges Jonathan at his house and the man destroys the dress that is the evidence of the murder. Eve decides to investigate by herself to prove Jonathan's innocence and gets closer to Charlotte, working as temporary maid. Meanwhile Detective Wilfred Smith (Michael Wilding) that is in charge of the case befriends Eve and they fall in love for each."Stage Fright" is a delightfully naive film of Alfred Hitchcock and the last in his British phase. Jane Wyman performs a naive wannabe actress that decides to investigate a murder with her eccentric father and unravels the truth. Marlene Dietrich is the manipulative actress and singer for whom men fall and are capable of anything to be with her. Romance and humor are present along this suspenseful story in this minor movie of Hitchcock. This time, the cameo of Alfred Hitchcock is on the street, the pedestrian in London that crosses Eve. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): "Pavor nos Bastidores" ("Funk in the Backstage")</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Very Good Not Very Good Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's been a long time since I've seen a film that really isn't all that good but that I nevertheless enjoy quite a lot. STAGE FRIGHT has a plot that is really rather silly. From the start, it's all quite implausible and yet entertaining. At first I found Jane Wyman terribly miscast as an American with two British parents living and working in London of all places. By the end of the film, I was able to buy into her role and found that she came through it pretty well. Dietrich, always rather problematic in my view, was nevertheless fascinating to watch in a role that reminded me of her character in Witness For The Prosecution. Todd was always a stiff actor and still he did a pretty good job in the role of the psychotic. Wilding was predictably strong and Alistair Sim really steals the show - he's great to watch. The ending was bizarre and still I decided that I rather liked all the nonsense - it's a very dated story that's a lot of fun in the most basic sort of way.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jane Wyman plays Eve Gill. She's an actress living in England. A man she loves (Richard Todd) is accused of killing the husband of an actress he's romancing (Marlene Dietrich). He didn't do it but the police don't believe him. Eve helps him hide out while she tries to find evidence to clear his name. The wonderful Alastair Sim pops up as her father and the sadly underused Michael Wilding is a detective investigating the case.It's a little too long and I could have lived without hearing Dietrich do THREE songs but still worth catching. There's many clever twists and turns in the plot and Wyman, Dietrich and Sim are excellent in their roles. Also it's beautifully directed (of course) with some great set pieces. Worth catching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Fortunately most of the comments about this film have looked correctly at it from a "total" point of view and thoroughly enjoyed it..Surely successful directors can be allowed to enjoy themselves and relax making a film that is different full of characters and a little wordy? By any standards this is a thoroughly enjoyable film-to suggest as do some reviewers that this film should be avoided as if it was a disease is completely puerile... Incidentally films-and particularly British films ,which unlike Hollywood productions , try to be rooted in reality ,can also be looked at as social history. This film does give at least some small sense of the London of that Post war period-including a perfect picture of the neat well groomed pretty American girl that all British girls imagined American girls to be-the film could have been opened out more but that would have cost money.My only real criticism is the music which is not entirely appropriate-but please boys .its only a movie (as the great man said)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Fine Film with a Common Misunderstanding</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I regard Stage Fright as one of Hitchcock's most undervalued films. It contains certain conventions of his film craft, yet introduces a unique twist--a twist that is misunderstood.As is always the case in a Hitchcock film, blood is the element of murder. Here, the blood stain on a dress is what links the characters together. Like a deadly game of tag, the dress goes from person to person, pulling them into the story, tainting them. First, the framed boyfriend, then the girl who loves him, then her father.Hitchcock likes to play with the difference between what the characters know and what the viewers know. When the audience knows more, it can add suspense (e.g. when Raymond Burr sees Grace Kelly point to the ring in Rear Window). Here he toys with us, giving us a flashback that misleads, but it is not really a "false flashback" as it has so often been called. Remember that this is not a case of the director showing what happened prior; it is an illustration of the story being told to Jane Wyman by Richard Todd. He is manipulating her with a false story. So the misunderstanding is caused by a false telling, not a false flashback. But, yes, Hitchcock does use it to mislead us. He is challenging the rules (but in a fair way) just as he fooled everyone by killing off the "star" of his movie Psycho.Personally, I enjoyed all the acting, especially Alastair Sims as Jane Wyman's father. I found the dialogue of this movie very enjoyable--clever and full of nuance and illusion. Sims really took advantage of his role and delivered some delicious lines.It was nice to Patricia Hitchcock in the minor role of Chubby. In Strangers on a Train, she gets to better display her talents.Wyman's character, an acting student, takes on the various roles as the lies pile up. Eventually, she becomes the assistant/dresser for the star actress played by Marlene Dietrich. Her father becomes her assistant/dresser in that role, as she is drawn deeper and deeper into her own fiction.At the beginning of the film, we see the curtain rise on the proceedings (something Baz Luhrmann used later). Until the final curtain falls, we are drawn into a suspenseful story of an amateur sleuth. Time is an important element in suspense, and Hitchcock does not need to put a clock on screen to remind us of the impending problems that threaten his characters here. And he sometimes seems to drag out the time with inconsequentials, knowing he is drawing us further into the anxiety of his protagonists.I thoroughly enjoyed this film. I hope others discover it.</fullReview>

There's some really bad editing and vocal over-dubbing which in itself is quite amusing. Certainly worth a watch. I find some of Hitchcock's work a little reliant on his name to put the essential bums on seats but this I'm glad to say is an exception. The songs performed by Marlene are instantly forgettable with the exception of 'La Vie En Rose' despite one of the forgettable numbers being written specifically for her/the movie by no other than COLE PORTER!

		<shortDescription>Good, but not great Hitchcock</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are a handful of Hitchcock films which I think are among the best ever produced. This particular film, however, has always bothered me. So this time around when I watched it, I decided to analyze it more carefully.The plot is pretty straight forward: Actress Charlotte Inwood (Marlene Dietrich) kills her husband, but attempts to frame Jonathan Cooper (Richard Todd) -- who is in love with her -- for the crime. Cooper's friend, Eve Gill (Jane Wyman), who is in love with him, tries to help Cooper, putting herself at great risk. Gill, however, begins to fall in love with one of the police detectives (Michael Wilding).I've discovered why this film is so much less than many of Hitchcock's other films. Think of any of his films from "Foreign Correspondent" to "Sabateur" to "Suspicion" to "Shadow Of A Doubt" to "Spellbound" to "The Man Who Knew Too Much" to "Vertigo" to "North By Northwest". In each case, an intelligent and innocent main character gets caught up in a dilemma which threatens their life and/or sanity. Not here. Here, one main character -- Richard Todd -- makes one dumb mistake after another, only incriminating himself all the more. For example, in a short period of time he tampers with murder evidence, breaks a window in full sight of other row houses, leaves the door open while he is at the murder scene, goes to the answer the door expecting the police but stuffing major evidence in his sport coat while doing so, and gets out of a taxi at the murder scene making it possible for the taxi driver to identify him. Really? Is anyone that stupid?Now you might say that Jane Wyman is the main character, and the one who gets innocently caught up in the murder intrigue. But, getting involved is -- again -- her own foolishness. And typically, Hitchcock's main characters are not foolish.Marlene Dietrich...well, I've never gotten the attraction. However, as her performances go, this is fairly reasonable. She was an attractive woman, but to me her acting is usually almost comic...when it's not supposed to be. Perhaps the only other film where I appreciate her involvement is "Judgement At Nuremberg". I did find the scene where she is smoking under a long veil to be bizarre...was it supposed to be? But, whoever thought Dietrich could sing should have had their head examined; it's the low point of the film.Jane Wyman is excellent here! As is a character actor I'm usually not impressed with -- Alastair Sim (perhaps you have to be British to appreciate him)...but he does well here as Wyman's father. Michael Wilding is also excellent here.One nice touch here that is not in all Hitchcock films is the rather wonderful love affair between Wyman and Wilding. It's done very nicely.While not one of Alfred Hitchcock's best films, it is, nevertheless, very entertaining. It's well worth your investment of time. The best aspect of the film -- the ending...with twists I didn't see coming!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After "Stage Fright" came out, Hitchcock took a lot of heat for the convention of using a falsehood in a flashback. So much so, that he considered it's use to be one of the major blunders of his career. Considering all the artifice that goes into making many modern films today, I'd say that Hitch should have given himself some credit for being a pioneer. I actually found it to be a stroke of originality to learn that Jonnie's (Richard Todd) tale of covering for Charlotte's (Marlene Dietrich) murder of her husband was all a lie. It comes right out of the blue after Charlotte herself confesses her complicity in the deed, tying the ends of a puzzle together right before Jonnie could potentially claim not a second, but a third victim (the first occurred even before this story took place). All in all, a fairly solid effort.Generally, I'm all over the place in my reaction to Hitchcock's films. Some of his efforts that are considered masterpieces, like "Strangers on a Train" (which immediately followed "Stage Fright"), I find to be unsatisfying because they feel less credible in the telling. With this film, viewer reaction on this site tends to the negative even though I found it to be intriguing, and even funny in certain scenes. Alistair Sim is particularly enjoyable, bringing some of his Ebeneezer Scrooge mannerism to the character of Eve's father, the Commodore. I especially got a kick out of one of his lines commenting on daughter Eve's possible romantic involvement with Mr. Ordinary (Michael Wilding) - "Do I hear the muted clanking of chains"? It was so reminiscent of his encounter with the ghost of Marley in "A Christmas Carol". In retrospect of course, as this film came out a year before the Christmas classic.And what can one say about Marlene Dietrich? She's a villainous beauty who's conniving character keeps the viewer convinced that she's the real murderer right up till the end. Her rendition of 'The Laziest Gal in Town' was almost surreal considering the extent to which she was involved in setting up Jonnie. Oddly, her involvement in the scheme was never really dealt with; that's an oversight that probably should have had a resolution.Interestingly, you could go all the way back to 1929 and Hitchcock's first 'talking' English film "Blackmail", to find a sympathetic main character who's involved with a detective. That film also offered a number of conventions that would become trademarks in later pictures - a silhouette of a murder in progress, a long view of a downward stairway, and one of the first cameos by the director who came to be known for suddenly showing up on screen in his pictures.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting But Uneven</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the late 1940s and early 1950s Alfred Hichcock went through what his supporters refer to as "a transitional stage" and what his critics call "a few years when he turned out one stinker after another." 1950 he released the film STAGE FRIGHT--and both audiences and critics of the day were greatly ticked off about it.STAGE FRIGHT is often described as "significant" because it was the first mainstream film to break the screen convention that neither director nor camera could actively lie to the audience--mislead, certainly, but not flatly lie, and not only does this occur in STAGE FRIGHT, the lie in question is the pivot on which the entire film rests. Over the years this convention has been thrown out the window by a number of notable films; as such, modern audiences are unlikely to think twice about the thing but instead simply kick themselves for being so silly.They might also want to kick themselves for bothering with the film in the first place, for STAGE FRIGHT tends to divide Hitchcock fans. You either like it a lot or not at all, and while I see much to admire in isolation, I fall among those who don't.The story concerns London drama student Eve Gill (Jane Wyman), a young woman who is hopelessly in love with Jonathan Cooper (Richard Todd)--who is too preoccupied with stage star Charlotte Inwood (Marlene Dietrich) to care much about Eve one way or another. At least, not until Inwood's husband is murdered and the police focus their attention on Jonathan, who knows who the killer is Charlotte herself but can't prove it and can't get the police to believe him. Eve agrees to exercise her acting talent: she will pretend to be a maid and will go to work for Charlotte in order to get the proof to clear Jonathan's name.This all sounds very good in theory, but there are some big problems in actual fact. The cast is somewhat less than one could wish: Dietrich comes off very well playing what is essentially a riff on her own screen image, but both Jane Wyman and Richard Todd seem fundamentally miscast. But the real stumbling block is the film's uneven pace. Hitchcock was a master at building tension through a juxtaposition of long takes and flash cuts, but something has gone astray in his work on this film, and STAGE FRIGHT seems slightly clunky and unduly slow; I kept wanting to tell the actors to "get on with it!" The DVD transfer is what you might call very good instead of excellent, and the DVD comes with a number of bells and whistles, mostly focusing on the "the director and camera lie to you!" issue--which is, as I've said, largely a non-issue from a modern point of view. If you are a Hitchcock fan, you'll want to see STAGE FRIGHT, but bear in mind that you'll probably fall hard on one side of the fence or the other in response.GFT, Amazon Reviewer</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A vastly underrated work of art</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Stage Fright" must be one of the most criminally underrated works of the master of suspense, Alfred Hitchcock; some critics even put it in the same league as the weakest of Hitchcock's works, "Topaz". The master himself badmouthed it and considered one of his greatest "failures" due to the confusion the plot seemed to generate in its release. The fact that it was followed by the tremendous "Strangers on a Train" made things harder for this little overlooked gem.Despite this apparent bad luck, "Stage Fright" is a movie that displays the master's fine eye for film-making, and it even foresees the bright future Hitchcock had ahead at the beginning of the 50s. It's safe to say that this movie, along with "Saboteur", are the roots of the most celebrated works by the Master. Works like "North By Northwest", "Vertigo" or "Psycho" have an immediate precursor in these two often forgotten films.After a beautiful set of introductory credits that set the action in London, the movie starts quickly as we have Johnatan Cooper (Richard Todd) and Eve Gill (Jane Wyman) running away on her car. The problem: Johnatan has been accused of the murder of the husband of the famous artist Charlotte Inwood (Marlene Dietrich). Since Charlotte was having an affair with Johnatan, all the clues point to him; however, and moved by her secret love towards her friend, Eve is convinced of his innocence and will do anything to prove he was set up by the treacherous Charlotte."Stage Fright" wonderfully mixes the suspense with the dark comedy in a way that probably only "Rear Window" can match. Despite its apparently light-hearted tone, the movie has its fair share of complexity, proving how careful was the Master when devising a new film. Very in tone with the theater setting, Hitchcock plays with the appearances as the characters are not always what they seem to be. Double identities, lies and tricks come to play in this thrilling play set in London.Jane Wyman is superb as the strong willed Eve, who goes as far as to disguise herself as Charlotte's maid to find some information. Her ability to change her appearance is outstanding, and her skill for the comedy is something that Hitchcock really gave good use. Her performance as Eve must be one of the greatest (and sadly forgotten) in any Hitchcock film While Eve's investigation is filled with problems; she has the good aid of his witty and at times cynic father, played wonderfully by Alastair Sim. He is probably the defining character of the film, as he represents the classic Hitchcocknian mix complete with that famous British humor and his deep expressive eyes. He definitely steals every scene he is in.Probably Marlene Dietrich never had a great range as an actress, but in the right role she was devastating. As Charlotte Inwood, she gives one of her greatest Femme Fatale performances ever and one of the biggest proofs of her powerful presence. With this three outstanding performances, it would be understandable if Richard Todd is a bit overshadowed; however, his take on Johnatan Cooper is superb, and specially in the last part, his performance turns out brilliant.There are many good things to say about this film, as it has a lot of amazing details that sadly have gone forgotten. "Stage Fright" is a movie worth watching and if you can, don't let anyone spoil it for you. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Foreshadowing Mr. Bates...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>How the tables turn in this movie. Hitch said this was his second mistake of his career when he falsely led the audience into thinking the flashback scene was real. But beware. It is hitch and he always has something in store for his audience. I thought that was the brilliance of the film but that can be argued.Marlene Dietrich is so unbelievably sexy and the way she presents herself is very nostalgic of her Von Sternberg days with "Blue Angel" and "The Scarlet Empress". Was 15 years that long to lose her sexuality? I don't think she ever lost it. Richard Todd's character (Johnny) is the quintessential pre-Norman Bates. He has urges to kill which is his fault. Every character has some sort of fault which becomes very evident throughout the film and which Hitch is known for. Jane Wyman's character has a thirst for wanting to know the truth, but she doesn't when she finds it. I like how the romance changes which was something new at the time. Hitch always created something new which audiences viewed as typical Hollywood entertainment which is a shame since his movies are art in itself.The opening seen says it all where London is the stage in the fictional story. Any Hitch fan should view this and go along with the ride and not question everything since it would ruin the experience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Now I don't think many would disagree that Hitch had done and would do considerably better films than this, but despite it's deficiencies, most notably the rather tame and unconvincing Jane Wyman, this still is a watchable yarn. Dietrich effortlessly delivers a convincing femme-fatale, and the wonderful Alastair Sim was perfect casting as a witty and charming (almost) rogue.The story itself is Hitchcock-by-numbers without any of the intensity and suspense that marked his best work, the plot twists were predictable and the pace somewhat lacking.The film will probably not be remembered as one of his best but thanks to some fine acting and casting and the fact that even bad Hitchcock is generally worth watching, this film probably warrants a 6.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What It Lacks in Style It Makes Up for in Humor</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I enjoyed "Stage Fright," but I can see why it's not counted among Hitchcock's best.Jane Wyman is unconvincing as a stage actress who goes "undercover" to investigate a murder that the man she loves is being blamed for. Marlene Dietrich plays this man's lover, and Wyman suspects her of framing him. The best performance, and the most compelling reason for watching the film, comes from Alistair Sim, as Wyman's cheeky father, who doesn't much care who murdered whom or why, but simply enjoys the drama of the chase."Stage Fright" doesn't have any of those thrilling Hitchcock set pieces or those dazzling shots he's known for, but what it lacks in style it makes up for in sense of humor. This is one of Hitchcock's more playful thrillers, with a more-than-usual amount of British humor.Also with Richard Todd as the accused man, and Richard Wilding, giving a charming performance as a detective who falls for Wyman.Grade: B+</fullReview>

		<fullReview>MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS.That's an underrated Hitchcock movie that contains, as most of his films, a lot of symbolism (I just want to mention this but I don't want to go into it because usually all these symbols are not something a viewer notices himself ? they require literature!). But it's also, apart from some weaknesses, a great piece of suspense. A lot of hiding and dressing up and pretending to be someone else? I like that.The various characters and the actors who played them are also worth mentioning. Marlene Dietrich is really revealed as a bad actress as soon as she stops playing herself. Interestingly, this happens only in a flashback which later turns out to be a lie. The role of the arrogant diva suits her perfectly. Jane Wyman does a great job as Eve Gill, and also as Doris, the housemaid she pretends to be. The most hilarious character in the film, giving it a touch of comedy, is Eve's father, who is played by Alastair Sim: a phlegmatic, clever old man with dramatic sense who constantly seems to understand and accept everything that happens around him.Not one of Hitchcock's most outstanding thrillers, but still: a Hitchcock.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hitchcock's Most Disappointing Film?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The world of the London theatre is the charming background in which Hitchcock and his writers have engineered to give an adequate cast some glossy and amusing things to do in this jerry-built disappointment. But these things, while witty independently, add up to very little continuous stimulation or tension in spite of the master's trademark fluid camera. They are merely an arbitrary deposit of dexterous or quaint sections, devoid of any real angst. And, consequently, that which one most customarily expects in a Hitchcock film---that is, amassed suspense---should not be expected here.Rather we get a tedious yarn about the ways in which a student actress attempts to protect her unrequited sweetie from a murder charge. We get a lengthy and elaborate staging of what might in principle be characterized as a counter-chase, with the young lady trying simultaneously to get proof and smear the trail. And we also get a blas look-see at a budding romance, when the young lady replaces her fondness onto the pleasant young detective on the case.In the sequence of these speckled events, we watch Marlene Dietrich give a show of glossy and sad theatrics in the role of a wicked musical star. We watch her callously and neatly dupe the accused man, Richard Todd, and we see the latter's breathless pains, in wide-eyed tumult, to forestall being caught. Wyman's dual-identity mischief gives Stage Fright more kick than its core mystery, as the central absurdity comes off as hokum at best, impertinent at worst. Wyman is the star of the show, upstaging Dietrich handily as well as a gathering of unexceptional men acting opposite her.We are also allowed to observe Jane Wyman's various ploys to save Todd from exposure. We watch her use her dramatics to insinuate herself as Dietrich's maid, with a number of close calls at being caught herself. We see her charm Michael Wilding, who plays the detective lightheartedly, and we ultimately have the honor of watching her make some pleasant love.But most outstandingly, in the itinerary of this picture, we are brought into dealings with Alistair Sim, the long-faced and sad-eyed English comic, who plays Miss Wyman's dad. And the pleasure of watching him marshal his intellect and wherewithal to help his daughter in her activities is one of the real joys of the film. He and Dame Sybil Thorndike, who plays his caustic wife, and a toothy lady named Joyce Grenfell, who does a hilarious bit as an attendant of a shooting-gallery at a theatrical fair, are the standouts in the show, and that should give you some suggestion of how the prominence has been placed.Without a doubt, one is keenly wary, after watching this haphazard film, that Hitchcock was much less concerned with his overall narrative than in separate scenes. One has the unnerving feeling that he so much enjoyed the parts that he lost, or didn't even bother about, compelling and coherent development. Certainly his audience follows in their gratification of the parts, but whether they will be quite as indifferent to the lack of shape or substance is something else.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>There's a reason this film isn't often remembered</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alfred Hitchcock's name has become synonymous with quality thrillers; and it doesn't get much better than Hitchcock at his best. Unfortunately, however, Stage Fright doesn't see the maestro doing what he does best, and as far as I'm concerned; this isn't even average Hitchcock. Unlike his best work, this isn't thrilling and the plot isn't set up well. There's a reason why Stage Fright isn't remembered along with masterpieces the likes of Rear Window, Psycho and Strangers on a Train; and the reason for that is that this is a plodding, dull mess of a film. I'm sure that the man himself is glad that his name isn't going down in history for this one. The story is ripe for plotting errors, as there's too much of it and it gets too complicated for any thrills far too quickly. We follow a man who is suspected of killing his lover's husband. A friend of his offers to hide him, while she sinks her teeth into a bit of amateur detective work. However, she ends up falling in love with the detective on the case...Many rate this film for it's character lead story; but this is actually a bad point; as it's hard for a character drama, much less one that is supposed to thrill, to succeed when the characters are so poorly drawn. The plot isn't interesting either, as we follow what is basically (in terms of Hitchcock films) a run of the mill murder, without much to distance it from many, many other films of the same ilk. The master director has tried to tie in themes of the stage itself into the proceedings, but rather than add to the plot; it only makes it more convoluted and ultimately more dull. If this was a film by almost any other director, then I probably wouldn't be so hard on it; but there's a certain expectation that comes with films from the great Alfred Hitchcock and this one doesn't even come close to meeting them. On the whole, this might entertain some people, and Hitchcock completists (myself included) will already have a reason to see it; but otherwise, I really can't recommend this movie. Hitchcock has done better and this is best left alone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining Hitchcock film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>WARNING: This film may contain spoilers on the film's storylineMany people say that this Alfred Hitchcock film is not as good as his others, I completly disagreeThis is my favourite Alfred Hitchcock film, I have seen it four times and I am entertained by it each time. It is about a stage actress and singer named Charlotte Inwood [Marlene Dietrich], who murders her husband and goes to her toy-boy Jonathan Cooper [Richard Todd] for help to destroy the evidence against her, notably a blood-stained dress. He goes to her home to get the body out of the way, but Charlotte's maid, Nellie [Kay Walsh] sees him.Jane Wyman plays Eve Gill, Todd's best friend, who is a drama student at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts. She assists him in escaping from the police, hiding him at her house which she shares with her dissaproving father [Alistair Sim]. Charlotte is only using Jonathan, as Eve soon finds out. Eve meets up with a detective Inspector Smith [Michael Wilding] and then she asks Nellie if she can pose as Charlotte's maid, so she can find out more, claiming that she is a journalist. She asks Jonathan to tell the police about Charlotte, because she is only using him. He refuses but later tells Charlotte, who is now having a relationship with her manager, that he still has the dress, which brings her two-pegs down.Eve is later blackmailed by Nellie, who threatens to reveal her true identity to Charlotte and Inspector Smith. Smith finds out and the two fall out. At the theatre, Eve tells Charlotte who she is, but Charlotte offers her cash to keep quiet to Smith about it, who has already heard over a loud-speaker. Charlotte is arrested but Eve hides Jonathan until he attempts to kill her. Eve leaves him for the police to find but a chase ensues, and Jonathan is killed under a stage iron curtain. Eve bursts into tears and leaves with Smith.Watch out for Hitchcock who appears as a man in the street. This film is largely based on the Thompson-Bywaters murder triangle of 1922. It is excellent and I reccomend it to everyone.10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This has all those Hitchcock staples. A man on the run who must develop trust with a group of sympathetic confederates, an effort to cover up being framed for a crime he says he did not commit, an innocent young woman who doesn't know where her loyalties should be, and an interesting group of settings which are used to make promote the plot line. Hitchcock usually gives us a person we already know is innocent, a Cary Grant or Robert Donat, but here he messes with us. The young woman becomes enamored with the investigator and the principle male figure is really only a friend. There is a really good performance by Alistair Sim (the star of the most wonderful version of "A Christmas Carol"). Some discount these older films of Hitchcock, but we see his hand in this all the way and it really works. Without giving away any spoilers, I can suggest you listen to the dialogue very carefully for dramatic irony.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a Riveting GEM of a Discovery!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I could kick myself for ignoring this Hitchcock masterpiece for so long! Considering I have been watching films (not just movies) since I was 10 then I ignored this movie for 49 years. What made me bypass this movie for so many years? The title is catchy and recognizable. I thought it was going to be something else entirely - and perhaps I thought it was going to bad. What fool I was! But thank goodness I recorded it and saw it tonight! One could go a whole lifetime and not discover this because no one talks about it. Why don't people discuss this movie!? There is so much in it to appreciate. Case in point: there is a very clever dolly shot during the first few minutes where walls disappear as a character enters a house from the street, closes the door, and the camera just keeps on rolling as the sound of the street fade away and the character walks in, up the stairs and down a hall.But in it I discovered wonderful Richard Todd and fascinating Michael Wilding, I found a new and higher appreciation for Marlene Dietrich, I added another notch to my highest appraisal of the legendary Alistair Sim, and now I see Jane Wyman in a whole new light. But the biggest thrill, was discovering a new movie by the master of suspense.I won't say much about the plot because whatever I say, is bound to be a lie! (wink-wink) I will let you ponder that statement...I would recommend to anyone who wants to discover the breadth of Hitchcock beyond his half-a-dozen more famous movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stage Fright</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hitchcock returns to London with this nifty variation on the "wronged man" formula. Instead of the innocent man pursuing to clear his name, in this film it is a woman in love with him. Robinson (Richard Todd) goes to Eve (Jane Wyman), a theater understudy in training, about his being trouble with the law due to trying to help his lover, a renowned stage actress, Mrs. Inwood (Marlene Dietrich) cover up the murder of her abusive husband. So she convinces her father (Alistair Sim) to hide Robinson until she can prove his innocence. Deciding to "go undercover" as a lowly maid, Eve convinces Inwood's current maid, Nellie (Kay Walsh), to allow her a chance to substitute for her. But when Eve meets a detective inspector in a pub, Smith (Michael Wilding), her life will become increasingly complicated.Excellent casting (especially Sim) top to bottom, typically magnificent camera-work (elaborating in a voice that speaks volumes when characters don't talk), exceptional lighting (especially at the end when Eve and Robinson are in hiding while police look for them in an abandoned theater building), and twisty conclusion make for a real Hitchcock gem that deserves re-evaluation. It certainly turns the *wronged man* plot on its head with that ending. Dietrich gets to sing and raise her iconic eyebrows during scenes where her diva character is trying to worm her way out of uncomfortable situations which could condemn her. Todd's teetering from one emotional place to another at the end, showing us a completely different side to his character is good stuff. Hitchcock brings back the umbrellas momentarily during the Garden party sequence which has a neat scene with Sim involving a doll, using a child to deliver it to a mortified Dietrich on stage performing in a tent. Wyman's soft-spoken, sweet character, juggling so many circumstances at once (including a blossoming romance with "Ordinary" Smith), is the right kind of heroine for this kind of Hitchcockian comedy thriller. She is driven, loyal to a fault, and trustworthy: Robinson could go to her and Inwood could confide in her. Sim's fragile relations with his estranged wife is a hoot. The taxi scene where Eve realizes her love for Smith, and he can't hold back his for her is a delight. I'm not a fan of Dietrich's singing, but her scene with the bloody dress doll is masterful. She gets a wonderful monologue at the end, too, when she understands she's an accessory. Because Hitchcock has so many classics, really good ones like "Frenzy" or "Stage Fright" often get overlooked. I think it is time Stage Fright gets its chance. Wyman is the lead all the way, in almost every scene, but it is clear Dietrich is the Movie Star; I think you can tell with how they are cast, that Dietrich's status was highly respected in a showy part while Wyman's cherubic heart-of-gold character is overwhelmed in comparison when the two appear together in scenes. None the more is this apparent than at the end when Eve tries to get a confession from Inwood; timidity is bruised by ego, as Eve is overpowered by Inwood when the two discuss what *really* happened to her husband. Sim is a joy to watch every time he appears. Witty, clever, wise, spirited, and given the best dialogue, this character Sim wears with kid gloves.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The final curtain.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With a friend being keen on watching a psychological Thriller,I decided to search around at a local CEX.Despite having heard about the "controversial" twist,I have somehow never got round to seeing Alfred Hitchcock's Stage Fright.Spotting the DVD being sold at a great price,I felt that it was the perfect time to step on to the stage.The plot:Whilst rehearsing a play at RADA,drama student Eve Gill is surprise to find her best friend (and secret crush) Jonathan Cooper visiting RADA,where he asks Gill if he can hide at her house.As she drives him to her home,Gill asks Cooper what he is running away from.Cooper reveals that he went to cover his secret lover Charlotte Inwood murder of her husband, (which led to Inwood's dress being covered in blood,an item which Cooper has gotten hold of)but got spotted by Inwood's dresser Nellie Goode,who reported Cooper to the cops for murder.Introducing Cooper to her dad,Gill's father notices that the blood on Inwood's dress appear to have been deliberately smeared on it.Suspecting that Inwood has set Cooper up,Gill &amp; her dad decide to confront Cooper with their suspicions,who shows his approval for their idea,by throwing the blood stained dress on a fire.Losing the biggest piece of evidence,Gill decides that the only way she can now prove Cooper's innocence is to go undercover and find out about what Inwood does once the curtain goes down.As she starts gathering info on Inwood,Gill begins to discover that murder is not a dress rehearsal.View on the film:Despite Hitchcock saying that the (still) controversial twist in Whitfield Cook/Alma Reville/James Bridie &amp; Ranald MacDougall adaptation of Selwyn Jepson novel Man Running was his "Second biggest film mistake" the twist actually sums up the themes in the film in a perfect manner.With mistrust being right at the centre,from Gill trying to keep her real motives hidden from Inwood,to Gill's dad suspecting the Cooper is not giving the full story on the blood stained dress.Going against the grain of Hitchcock's traditional "man on the run",the writers instead push all the guys to the side lines,in order to make this a gripping women on the run,as Gill's attempts to keep her true motive hidden from Inwood leads to Gill having to take increasingly desperate measures,in order to keep both sides of her life separate from each other.Making sure that the movie does not solely rely on its sting,the writers build a superb menacing Film Noir atmosphere,which creeps across the screen as Gill's desire for the facts to change tightens its grip.Perfectly setting the mood by raising the curtain on London,Hitchcock &amp; cinematographer Wilkie Cooper push the viewer into the fractured psychological issues facing the characters with dazzlingly low-lit,tightly held shots,which allow the viewer to witness the moment when the "truth" tears Gill apart and leaves Cooper's image completely shattered. Emphasizing the dark uneasy mood,Hitchcock covers the film in ultra-stylised tracking shots,which along with revealing the dark corners of the stage that Cooper &amp; Gill hide in,also subtly expose Gill's belief that she and Cooper are both on the same track.Lighting up the title the moment she steps on stage,the alluring Marlene Dietrich gives an excellent performance that hits a perfect mix of Femme Fatale &amp; upper-crust Diva.Along with reaching the high notes in the movies catchy songs,Dietrich keeps Inwood pouring with slick charisma,which leads to Inwood showing no weaknesses,when Gill confronts her with the "truth".Going in the other direction to Dietrich,a pretty Jane Wyman gives a great performance as Gill,thanks to Wyman giving Gill a strong determination over clearing Cooper's name,which Wyman gradually shows to crumble,as Gill uncovers the real events behind the murder.Joining the girls, Alastair Sim gives a performance flowing with charm as Gill's nervous dad,whilst Richard Todd shows Cooper's calm manner to be a hollow shell,which shatters as he exits,stage death.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Stage Fright is directed by Alfred Hitchcock and collectively written by Whitfield Cook, Ranald MacDougall, Alma Reville and James Bridie, it's based on the novel "Man Running" written by Selwyn Jepson. It stars Jane Wyman, Marlene Dietrich, Michael Wilding, Richard Todd and Alastair Sim. Plot sees Wyman as drama student Eve Gill, who is asked by friend Jonathan Cooper (Todd) for help because he is on the run for the alleged murder of Charlotte Inwood's (Dietrich) husband. He swears his innocence and with Eve's father (Sim) also in tow, they set about trying to prove Jonathan's innocence. It kind of goes without saying, since 90% of other reviews for Stage Fright have made the point, but Stage Fright is a lesser Hitchcock movie in terms of quality. In fact, watching it now upon revisits, it's actually, well, a bit of a bore. Yes it finds the directing maestro dallying in the realm of acting = deception, himself the deception puppet master, and the cast can't be faulted for quality of performance; notably Wyman who leads the film as a heroine taking on a number of different guises to a number of different people. But it lacks menace, it lacks sardonic humour and after playing the audience like an appropriately named fiddle, the pay off lacks dramatic impact or surprise. It has a bit more to it than merely being one for Hitchcock completists, for one thing fans of British cinema get a nice cameo from the wonderful Joyce Grenfell, but unlike a good portion of Hitchcock's work, this one doesn't hold up on repeat viewings. Decent but not actually very good. 6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"I played the Fourth Deadly Sin"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For an Alfred Hitchcock thriller released in 1950, "Stage Fright" seems strangely behind the times. Afterall, "Shadow of a Doubt" was released in 1943, "Rope" a fear years later and "Strangers on a Train" a year after "Stage Fright". These are all incredibly "modern" pictures. "Stage Fright", in contrast, plays like one of Hitchcock's 1930s thrillers, lacking the sophistication of much of his 1940s work. At the same time, were it released by any other director, "Fright" would perhaps be fairly highly regarded. It's just, with Hitchcock, one places higher standards.The plot? The incomparable Marlene Dietrich plays Charlotte Inwood, a stage actress who rules London's theatre houses. Being a cold hearted wench, she frames actor Jonathan Cooper (Richard Todd) for the murder of her husband and then watches with delight as poor Cooper falls headlong into another one of Hitchcock's Kafkaesque "wrong man" plots. Assisting Cooper is Eve Gill (Jane Wyman), a spunky young actress who attempts to prove Cooper's innocence. Resilent and cunning, she ensnares Charlotte in a trap of her own. Sounds like Hitchcock's "Spellbound"? Yes, it's virtually the same film.Unsurprisingly, "Stage Fright" is preoccupied with stages, acting, false identities and performances. All the main characters are actors, and Eve frequently poses as invented characters in order to learn information, get into barred locations or bribe others. The film's first three acts are likewise structured around a series of lies (virtually everything said is dishonest), whilst the film's climax involves a series of truthful revelations, though again these are staged as actorly performances. As far as I know, this was also the first film to use a now well-worm clich; it's the old gag in which the villain is tricked into revealing or confessing his or her crimes in front of an audience he or she is unaware is present ("Minority Report", "Monster's Inc" etc etc).The film marked Hitchcock's return to England after a series of pictures in America. It contains one riveting, suspenseful set piece, and continues Hitchcock's trend of favouring strong female roles. The rest of the film is well shot, but its script will undoubtedly seem generic and well-worn to modern audiences.7.9/10 ? Worth one viewing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I do not see how this has any comedy in it, but being directed by Sir Alfred Hitchcock, I was happy to watch this made in London underrated (comedy) thriller. Basically acting student Jonathan Cooper (Richard Todd) is suspect to the murder of the husband of his mistress, actress/singer Charlotte Inwood (Marlene Dietrich). He asks his aspiring actress friend Eve Gill (Jane Wyman) to hide him, and her eccentric father Commodore Gill (Scrooge's Alastair Sim), while she tries to prove his innocence. She becomes Charlotte's temporary maid "Doris Tinsdale" to gain close access to the star, and show her up as the real murderer. Eve's father devises a way to get Charlotte to confess in front of investigator Inspector Wilffred O. 'Ordinary' Smith (Michael Wilding), which fails. So with the help of hidden microphones that boom around the theatre Eve blackmails Charlotte to confession, and everyone hears everything. In the end though, after all the effort Eve went through to prove his innocence, Jonathan was in fact the murderer, and he meets a sticky death on stage. Also starring Sybil Thorndike as Mrs. Gill, Kay Walsh as Nellie Goode, Miles Malleson as Mr. Fortesque, Hector MacGregor as Freddie Williams, Andr Morell as Inspector Byard, Joyce Grenfell as 'Lovely Ducks', Patricia Hitchcock as Chubby Bannister and Ballard Berkeley as Sergeant Mellish, and Hitchcock's cameo is Man Staring at Eve on Street (even more obvious than Notorious). There were some good performances, especially Wyman and Dietrich, the direction of course is very good, and there are some good suspense moments, so I would recommend people should see it. Sir Alfred Hitchcock was number 75 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons. Very good!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An actress goes undercover to try to expose a killer in this murder mystery set in London. One of Hitchcock's least interesting films is undone by a plodding story that gets bogged down in details and drags on far too long. Wyman looks drab and bored as an actress who turns into Nancy Drew. The only saving graces are the performances of Sim as Wyman's father, Wilding as a detective, and the ever-flamboyant Dietrich as the woman suspected of murdering her husband. The scenes involving Sims and Thorndike, as Wyman's mother, are quite amusing, but there's not enough of that. Even Hichcock's camera work is mundane. The finale is rather underwhelming.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A wonderful underappreciated film by Hitchcock</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stage Fright is quite simply one of the greatest films made by one of the English languages greatest directors. It's rather poor reception and reputation is unfortunate, yet, highly understandable. The film itself plays with a number of time honored devices used in the construction of narrative film. Most radically it leads our sense of our "sacred" flashback in question and has in its two leading actresses one of the most thorough disections of gender in any film made in the commercial American cinema. Quite simply we really never know what our intended position vis-a-vis Eve (Jane Wyman) or Charolette (Marlene Dietrich) should be. They are both actresses (one a grand lady of the stage and the other a student) and their vocation is tied to their gender in remarkable and disturbing ways. This may be the film, in which, Hitchcock enlists the greatest number of brilliant performances from his actors - including a hypnotically powerful performance by Alisair Sim as Eve's father, and good work by Richard Todd, Sybil Thorndike and Michael Wilding. Even the minor roles are well performed- consider Kay Walsh as the maid Nellie Good who has only a few scenes in the film, but manages to develop a remarkably complex character. The film plays such tricks on us and has such high demands on the audience in terms of character identification that it isn't really surprising that so many folks find the film flawed. It does seem nonesensical to call a narrative with this many twists and turns dull. I can't think of a more suspenseful and excitingly disturbing Hollywood film. </fullReview>

		<fullReview>Great movie: exciting and funny with some wicked turns you really don't expect (especially in the time, when this movie was released). Marlene Dietrich playing another bad character and singing songs like "The laziest girl in town" and Jane Wyman with her innocent look and detective-instinct to investigate a murder-case, in which her secret-love is involved, are doing great in this movie. But there are also several little parts in this movie (like the doll-woman from the festival or Alfred's daughter) freshing up this movie with their talent and funny interpretation of the scenes. I can't imagine, why so many people don't know about this movie as it has all the quality and the stars to be a huge hit and masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stuck in the middle: 10 years after Rebecca, 10 years before Psycho</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What with his British period habits and his will to please American (i.e. wider) audiences Hitch made his way to absolute masterpieces through sometime too laborious movies. Stage Fright is a perfect example. You feel it has been done carefully but the spirit is not there. Hitchcock himself would point out the main flaws: Jane Wyman was too old for the part of a naive girl aiming to save a man she secretly loves and the villains' part (Marlene Dietrich's side of the stage) is no good for they fear to be accused.(SPOILERS AHEAD) Actually the main thing that made Stage Fright a disappointment in 1950 turned out to be the flashback. Jonathan (Richard Todd) lies when he accounts for his involvement in Charlotte's husband murder. By the time movie-goers would not accept such a cheating scene. Hitchcock thought he could afford that: it's an odd point to consider since he would advocate for suspense against surprise. Had the script avoided major flaws were he able to afford this lying flashback on the very first reel? I'm still not sure. (END OF SPOILER ALERT)Hitchcock's movies where the hero is a woman are based on different qualities than the usual wrong man's part with a character crawling between villains and the police. Such is the case with Rebecca, Notorious (well it's a tie between Ingrid and Cary) or even Vertigo where the focus is on Kim Novak even if we stand with Jimmy Stewart. Others like Jamaica Inn, Suspicion, Under Capricorn or of course Marnie widely miss their point.Young and Innocent would have been a better example for what Hitch tried to achieve here but it's a total Brit-Hitch. The focus in such movies is pace. Coming to America Sir Alfred learned something else that gave him enough material to make another 25 movies without repeating his old British jokes. Stage Fright is definitely stuck in the middle. Eager to place light jokes (especially with Wyman's father) but dead-serious on the whole.(POSSIBLE SPOILER) The mix-up is obvious in the end. Hitch chooses the pace that worked so well in the 39 Steps. Thus the conclusion bluntly arrives while it took quite a little more to build the tension. To tell us two minutes before the end that the murderer is psychologically unstable to get rid of him is quite out of schedule. Psychological matters should not be an easy excuse. Fortunately Hitchcock made Psycho and that's enough to make an excuse for his former forays into psychoanalysis.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Stage Fright" is one of Alfred Hitchcock's most entertaining, involving and just plain fun pictures. Unfortunately, it took me until now to see it, because all the books and articles about Alfred Hitchcock don't mention this film when it comes to recommendations, and that is a pity. The plot is lively but it is the dialogue and the actors which make the picture. Alastair Sim, Jane Wyman, and Michael Wilding are standouts, and Marlene Dietrich is well, Marlene Dietrich. What more do you need to say? The score is perfectly pitched and as per Hitchcock, moody, romantic and sinister as the need arises. The director makes great use of lighting techniques to highlight a character's face and particularly their eyes at key moments. A reminder once again that Alfred Hitchcock is one of cinema's greats.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly weak and easy to forget...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think this film has a lot against it that you can't necessarily blame entirely on the production--though it has problems. With such amazing films from the 1950s as "Vertigo", "Dial M For Murder", "Strangers on a Train", "North By Northwest", "The Rear Window" and "To Catch a Thief" (among others) all coming from Alfred Hitchcock during this decade, it makes "Stage Fright" seem poor by comparison. Had it not been natural to compare these films, it sure would have made "Stage Fright" look a lot stronger.Unfortunately, this is not the only problem the film has against it. The plot is very slow and complicated, there is a very atypical sort of appearance by Marlene Dietrich (you don't expect song and dance numbers in a Hitchcock film) and the film used a FALSE flashback scene--something that infuriated a lot of patrons at the time. I knew it was coming and still thought it harmed the film. In addition, the story seemed to drag and just never seemed all that interesting. Now it's not a bad film--just not one that is much more than a time-passer. Perhaps you'll like it more than I did...and I hope you do.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hitchcock has 5 or 6 great films, and a boatload of interesting mediocre ones. Much more interesting than the usual Hitch checklist (a stairway, a fall, a mother, a blonde), is that he's always toying with viewpoint (causing viewers to worry that a killer (!) might not get his evidence back from a victim in Frenzy, etc.). 'Stage Fright' monkeys with viewpoint, and artifice/performance in equal parts. But the script has problems. The movie starts from Jonathan's (Richard Todd) viewpoint, then jumps to Eve's (Wyman - 15:00) then to an omniscient viewpoint (48:00), then back to Eve; not because it is in masterful control, but because the narrative is trying to overcome problems of its own making (it needs to preserve a trick ending); which are introduced in the first few minutes. The central problem that still receives censure/debate has to do with the initial viewpoint.We're asked to root for another generic, bland, virtuous couple (Wyman &amp; Wilding), a holdover from scads of Victorian fiction (in 1950!). Dietrich's over the top scenes are bit much, but on the other hand she can take a mediocre line and give it gravitas ("It's as if my mother slapped me in the face"). It has the usual heroine's family sub-plot (Suspicion, Young &amp; Innocent) that could have probably been scrapped completely. It's where the movie bogs down. Hitch includes another of his loathed, bespectacled shrews here (as in Strangers on a Train). This has more dramatic noir lighting in it, than Notorious, which people describe as noir (I've never understood that). It has a weird international cast (American, English, German) which is never very persuasively explained. Eve really should be British (not Wyman).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Untidy actor vehicle</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A straightforward Hitchock thriller that loses its way as it focuses on its notable stars. It is a wonderful role for Jane Wyman who is the thematic principal, an actor trying to get resolution and the truth by taking on multiple roles. For her the film (in the year following an Oscar win) is pretty much a triumph.Yet the pungent, extraordinary presence of Marlene Dietrich over- balances the story along with the comic-horror approach of Alastair Sim (yet to score the great, commensurately spooky hit that was An Inspector Calls). Hitchcock contrives a real handbrake of a denouement in order to accommodate the dual love interest as the charismatic Richard Todd goes up against Michael Wilding's dreary Inspector. It's laminated with a slick of sub-Rachmaninov by Leighton Lucas... really you can tell all you need to know from Joyce Grenfell making the principal credits for a single scene cameo which Hitchcock could easily have cut. 4/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It Plods and Slogs but Hitchcock Manages Some Deceit and Interest</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Plodding, Sometimes Dull, but Occasionally Interesting Semi-Misfire from Alfred Hitchcock that is Perhaps (along with Marnie (1962) the Directors Most Divisive Film. By 1950 the Hitchcock Name was an Invitation to Audiences to be Entertained in Offbeat Suspense with Eye-Popping Directorial and Cinemagraphic Flourishes and Extravagances.This One Does Contain a Few, if Not Enough Cinema Tricks and Hitch Seems Clever Only Half the Time. The Film is Weighty and Dense with Characters "Acting" (Or are they?) Against Expectations as the Script Calls for Much Deception and Many Side Characters. Actually, Some of the Peripheral People are More Engaging than the Principals.For Example, the Blackmailing Maid and the Irritating Duck Lady are Standouts, and Alistaire Sims is More Memorable than Jane Wyman, or the Two Leading Man Stiffs. Neither Men Have the Gravitas or Charm to be an Attraction. Both are Almost Mannequin Like and Marlene Dietrich has No Problem Stealing the Show from Them and the Rather Boring Performance from Jane Wyman.Overall, the Controversial Opening Flashback Works Despite All the Whining. Manipulative and Slight of Hand are Key Hitchcock and This Trick Should be Accepted and Not Rejected. In the Context of Hitchcock Films and All the Lies/Truthing that Goes on in This Thing, Well, It Fits Right In. The Killing of the Killer at the End is Abrupt and is Almost Anti-Climatic, Even Though it Symbolically Fits the Title.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sometimes Disbelief Just Cannot Be Suspended</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is a recurring plot in crime dramas: an innocent man is suspected of committing a murder, and he tries to evade the police long enough to prove his own innocence. Hitchcock often used it, as in "The 39 Steps." This plot requires us to suspend disbelief, because no one has ever proved his innocence in real life by avoiding the police long enough to find out who really did it and getting evidence to prove it. "Stage Fright" is a slight variation on this plot. In this case, the suspect's friend tries to hide him from the police long enough to prove the murder was committed by someone else. Once again, no one in real life has ever managed to do that.In a really good movie, like "The 39 Steps," suspending disbelief is easy, and we are well rewarded for doing so. But in a mediocre film like "Stage Fright," we are only partially engaged in the movie, and thus find ourselves comparing what happens with reality, and being a little put off by the difference. Instead of suspending disbelief, we find ourselves simply disbelieving.Maybe it is just me, but if I were suspected of a crime I did not commit, I would get myself a lawyer and turn myself in to the police. The movie begins with Jonathan telling Eve that Charlotte came over to his apartment with blood on her dress, saying she killed her husband in self-defense during an argument. He says he agreed to help her establish an alibi, and he goes back to her place to get another dress, and while he is there, tries to make it look like a burglary. However, Charlotte's maid shows up, sees him, and is able to identify him to the police. Now, we later find out that this story is a lie. But while I was watching it, taking this story seriously, I thought to myself that I would have simply advised Charlotte to get a lawyer and turn herself in to the police. And if she refused, I would have notified the police anyway.Furthermore, when Jonathan shows up at the theater where Eve, an actress, is in rehearsal, he tells her that the police want him for something he didn't do, and she agrees to help him escape. She should have told Jonathan to get a lawyer and turn himself in to the police. If he refused to do so, she should have notified the police herself.She takes Jonathan to her father's place, where the father agrees to help Eve hide Jonathan. By this time, it will come as no surprise when I say that if I had been Eve's father, I would have told Jonathan to get a lawyer and turn himself in to the police. If Jonathan and Eve refused to go along with this idea, I would have notified the police anyway.Later, we find out that it was Jonathan who killed Charlotte's husband. But that only allows for one more iteration of my general advice. In that case, Charlotte should have gotten a lawyer and gone to the police. Even if she did instigate the murder, as Jonathan claims, she could have denied involvement, and Jonathan would have been the one to go to prison.Now, it might be argued that if any one of these characters had gone to the police, as I say they should have, there would have been no movie. But any movie that is lackluster enough to allow for disbelief, rather than the suspension thereof, is a movie we would have been better off without.</fullReview>

We see the back of Wyman's head for a few seconds. It fills the screen-aha, something is happening in front of her. Naw. Nothing. Then why show the back of a head? In another scene, she's embracing a man. Closeup of her face. She is realizing something-or having an fit or what. It's not explained. Thus, here and there Wyman breaks character and acts as if she just landed on this planet. Her bewilderment/epiphany is because of...what? I suspect that these episodes are not meant to be arcane, but are just sloppy film making. Hitch took a called third strike.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Definitely one of the poorest of Hitchcock's works</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a surprisingly dull movie by Alfred Hitchcock. There is little of the elegance of camera work or playing with emotions that you normally get in a Hitchcock film. The problem is a general lack of emotion. You just don't feel involved - the plot is preposterous, the behaviour of the characters completely absurd. Richard Todd is a wooden and charmless villain and the tone of the film is full of uncertainty. I was unable to care about the fate of the characters - I even found Alistair Sim over mannered and irritating.I must say the film does not compare with other lesser known works by Hitchcock. Topaz is seriously underrated - far superior to this as is Frenzy.To sum up this movie is unusually boring and flags long before the conclusion.</fullReview>

Hitch's own wife helped write the script, which lacks suspense and humor and wastes the talents and star-power of Marlene Dietrich. I'm one of Hitchcock's biggest fans, but I have to say this is barely mediocre.Another problem is Jane Wyman, who was so appealing in Billy Wilder's THE LOST WEEKEND, looks like a nun and has no screen presence whatsoever. Even the director's most avid fans will want to avoid this. He would not make another stinker for quite some time. This was his only bad film of the 1950's. STRANGERS ON A TRAIN came next and no Hitch film missed until 1964's MARNIE.</fullReview>

It's a fact universally acknowledged that often even the worst movies contain something that attracts, nine times out of ten it's a performer, sometimes the director and occasionally the more discerning will opt for a writer - for example Hitchcock's very next film, Strangers On A Train, was co-written by Raymond Chandler which is enough of a selling point for me. In the case of Stage Fright the selling point was a Cole Porter song, The Laziest Gal In Town, performed by Marlene Dietrich, which just about made the stilted plot and acting bearable. If you like vintage British films you may also want to see a line-up that includes Sybil Thorndike, Joyce Grenfall, Miles Malleson and Alistair Sim albeit in a tepid meller about as believable as Crossroads.</fullReview>
