		<shortDescription>What's important is that it gets you thinking</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I found this documentary to be excellent. It is a thought provoking, well executed expose' on the manipulations of the masses by those with wealth and power. Some who watch it will find many of it's connections far-fetched, but the fact of the matter is: there are many sources to back them up.The Truth is, this film doesn't have to be 100% correct, or 75%, or 50%. There's still some serious problems with the world if a forth of it's information holds water. And even if it's all bull, it'll shake you into questioning what is true. And that's all it needs to do.No one should have any illusions abut what the War on Terrorism or our Federal Banking System.As a student of both American and European History I found the explanations given in this documentary to be reasonable and logical. Watch it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've watched this movie about 4 times by now, will definitely watch it again as i show it to others. Many interesting arguments, many good points.While this film is aimed to prove everything presented as truth, one should watch this with an open mind. Take in all the topics, then do your own research, just with any speaker/film/presentation. To blindly follow is pure ignorance.I do not believe everything in this film. I do however think that everyone should see it if nothing more than a thought experiment. You should be aware of all sides of an argument as to make your argument more effective.You don't have to agree to find this film interesting.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Watch it. It is worth to see every single second of this. Spread around.I part: Very precise connection of astrology and religion, in facts.II part: Another 9/11 truth, without government bull**** commission.III part: Answer who is who in the political, military, economy of USA. Im not American, but i felt miserably after this one. Cant imagine how it would looks like that i AM American. Sadly, American government likes to interfere in other's country business. One of it is mine :( It would be much better if they turn their heads to personal problems of common American citizen.Along with Michal Moore's Sicko, this is a bullseye!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love this movie. and no I don't take everything they say as full truth just because they say it is. But I do plenty of my own research after watching movies like these and this one is good. But of course don't believe any one source (me included) do all your own research and get your data from a variety of sources and different countries. Then establish your own opinion. I believe they should show movies like these in public schools and in Colleges. Why let only one side of the story claim to be truth? Anyway.. this movie is fast and comes at you. It is not a slow political documentary, I love they way they lay out their cards. its almost like a Informational Action Thriller of debated Non-Fiction.Do your family, friends, neighbors, and fellow Americans a favor and watch this film and tell everyone you know to watch it. Its free on the internet. It only costs you 2 hours of your life you would have waisted watching worthless reality TV anyway.ENJOY!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film explores three themes which seem totally unrelated: the Christian faith; the attacks of September 11, 2001; the American Federal Reserve System and Income tax. I have never seen a documentary in which images and music were put together in such a powerful and artistic way. The film depicts the fraudulent Zeitgeists that have been used through the centuries to subdue others into acquiescing. It shows that the one truth we are fed daily is a carefully crafted lie, which hold us spellbound. I regret the movie replaces the seen-trough lies with conclusions which had better not been drawn: it would have sufficed to point to the many similarities between The Bible and older books, like the Egyptian book of the dead, without adding the conclusion that Jesus of Nazareth might never have existed. Emphesizing this option as being the most likely one, takes the focus away from the extensive lies which surround Christianity for certain, as is exposed in this film.It rightly connects the tragic events of 9/11 with the true perpetrators thereof, and does not shy from showing the terrible consequences in human life both on that day and in the years that followed in a fraudulous "War on Terror", which to most people in it is very real, but for its inventors just a cruel joke on a population of semi-sentient humans, who slaughter human life as some humans would slaughter cattle.Finally, it reveals that unbelievable manipulation has reached a 100-year anniversary after the 1907 panic and the 1913 introduction of the Ferderal Reserve bill, which opened the way to stage not one but two World Wars, which to the casual beholder did little to change the balance of power in the world, but in truth transfered power from the open to the shadows on a grand scale.A film worth watching over and over again - if you can stomach its dreadful horrors, both in picture and in concept.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>zeitgeist, like the man from earth, is not meant to provide answers or change conceptions, but simply presents a possible path of evolution for mankind. I've met many people that were not able psychically to conceive that such a massive conspiracy could actually exist. I guess this is the most difficult thing to believe. To be pulled out of a world that makes sense and that they can understand and suddenly to find themselves alone facing a brutal system, governed by secrets and lies and manipulations.It is best to ask question, but it is better to do something about it, rather than feeling sorry for yourself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Questions worth asking</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is a lot of arguing going on about the legitimacy of the claims made by this film. Certainly we cannot just swallow everything the filmmaker is trying to feed us. However, the film is not the first to suggest that 9/11 is a vehicle of war and profit designed by the American government. Whether or not you believe it outright or not, the questions provoked by the film are worth asking and can't be ignored. The supposed evidence provided by the government to substantiate their final explanation is feeble at best, when compared to the perhaps theoretical evidence offered by films and articles of this kind. I agree that the people are conditioned to accept media as truth, and thus have accepted the government as such also. The people have allowed the government and media to strip them of their thirst for truth by tricking them into believing anything. As responsible people we can't sit back and allow this to continue. We are entitled to the truth, and we are not getting it. I'm not saying that this film is 100% correct or anything like that. I'm only saying that to any reasonably intelligent person, it's obvious that there are major deceptions at work here. The longer we ignore them, the more we become them until eventually it just won't matter because there won't be anything we can do about it. If everyone were to demand answers, we might just get them.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is amazingly convincing. Many people have tried to guilt you into believing 9/11 was an inside job, tried to barrage you with endless facts. The only documentary that can rival this documentary is "Endgame- Blueprint for Global Enslavement." This movie systematically disproves the greatest believed story of all time, by using simple pagan facts. This movie systematically disproves everything the pigs of our government have tried to prove. This movie disproves all of the reasons behind every major war in the past century. This movie has changed everything I thought would happen in the future. This movie encourages you to get up off your *ss and become enlightened to what the government is actually doing to try and control everything about you.In the words of Shakespeare: "Cry havoc and let slip the dogs of war."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lacks hard evidence, just speculations = waste of time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many of my friends have told me to go watch this internet-documentary called "zeitgeist". Knowing my atheist-views, they thought i would love it. So i watched it. But I'm not impressed. Where are the evidence? Seriously, all the books and sources that are mentioned are authors that quote each other. And most other sources are internet-sources. The sources for this movie is whether you like it or not not that creditable. There are NO unbiased sources for this movie. It is just like the documentary "Chariot of The Gods", a documentary (and book) that states that Aliens started human civilization. If you watch it and accept all statements, facts and sources given to you in that movie blindly, then you start believing that aliens did start human civilization. But a further critical look at "Chariots of The Gods" revealed that it is only a fairy-tale. It has no real evidence of its grand claims - no smoking gun.And the same is the problem with Zeitgeist. It is a biased and poorly made "documentary". Just because some anti-religious people want there to be an evil conspiracy behind all religions doesn't make it true. Zeitgeist is a fun piece of fiction. But that is all it is. It has, whether you like it or not, no hard evidence. It is simply just speculations and questionable sources. The manuscript and allegations of Zeitgeist would never make it to be a paper on a real university (those mail-order universities, where all conspiracy theorists get their degrees from are not respectable or real universities). The allegations of Zeitgeist can turn out to be true, in the long run. But until this day they have no hard evidence of their claims - they lack the smoking-gun kind of evidence. Therefore people should not take this poor documentary seriously, until hard and unquestionable evidence have been found. But until that day i will laugh at people who believe in this so-called "documentary", just as i laugh at the idea of God.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the greatest films provoking the thinking process.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Zeitgeist offers a grim view of things, that connects a lot of questions that arise when one wonders why things are the way they are, while we have more than we need on this planet. (not enough compassion among those who are being given the power, by the people)Zeitgeist offers a path to lots of topics, about which one can finally engage some intelligent debate, without being shut down by simple evasive excuses, mostly in the form of offensive comments.Zeitgeist offers a lot of (black) humor in many ways, f.ex in the form of ridiculous criticism, like most of films that try to really make a difference and fight the commonly accepted values. It shows effectively how fear and the lack of quality education (wisdom, not talking about merits or institutions) affects our thinking.Some critics even seem to derive a weird kind of pleasure from neglecting things and praising their narrow views about the Zeitgeist being overly one sided. F.ex, should the film digest all the information for the viewer? That kind of stuff is widely seen on many movies. Especially considering films like Zeitgeist, it would affect destructively to the effectively developing mood and atmosphere. Leading to a situation where there is less room for these kinds of great emotions and thoughts among viewers that it offers as it is. We should try to find our fears and let them go, so we could think more clearly and maybe even enjoy some new things. We have our primitive side, but we also have the power to learn to control it.Here's a bit more of this "lunatic" "mumble" to lighten up the end (and to give some of you an excuse to keep your values): Concern, respect and self-awareness. Mix those up and you get compassion, kindness and love. Your "heaven" on Earth. Lets get this species evolving! ;)With Love, Juha K. K. Oksanen</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>WE are extraordinary!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Whether you like this movie or not, it would be idiotic NOT to watch it and hold it up against the facts that already exists in this world!!Mass-manipulation, religious madness, scare-tactics, False Flag-operations, hidden agendas, economical manipulation, fascist regimes, hidden truths, corrupted educational systems... I could go on and on! Many controversial topics are presented in this documentary, and unlike many critics point out, it is all well documented for(On the official website of the documentary you will find a "Sources"-section, I guess no journalist or critic ever thought to look there?!). But as any other publication in the mass-medias, in this case the Internet, it should be watched with a well-sized portion of good sense. I know how you Americans like well-sized portions so this should create no obstacles for you to jump over, or blow up!!? My good sense tells me that the Western World today, as we know it, are living a lie. We are puppets in a giant show, we are both the actors and the audience controlled by very few instructors, but what we fail to realize is that we could end this show quicker than they started it! We just need to open our eyes to new possibilities. It's not like this is new to us either. Once the World was flat but some guy wanted to prove people wrong, so he sailed to the west in order to go AROUND the globe and land in India, thus greeting the Indians. Well, I guess the people living there ended up being called Indians, but it wasn't India he discovered back in 1492.So watch this!! Think about it after wards and reflect on e.g. WHY there are so many god-sons from different religions who all are born on the 25th of December, WHY George W. Bush never made a statement alone or under oath regarding 9/11, WHY they are trying to enforce a North American Union over your heads, WHY you DON'T have to pay income taxes since it doesn't exist by law and is in conflict with the Constitution itself, WHY any American are completely stripped of ALL rights if they are under suspicion of being a TERRORIST, WHY no historians EVER wrote about a Jesus Christ. Think people, think.. THEN make a decision of whether you would believe what you knew before Zeitgeist or after! I believe my life after Zeitgeist! I am extraordinary - WE are extraordinary!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Is this supposed to be a documentary?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If this movie is documenting something it certainly isn't in this universe. This is more of a fiction film then a documentary.I don't know that you can even call this a fiction film, it is more like two fiction films with a segment taken from Loose Change stuck in the middle.(1). ReligionThis part is probably the most believable part of the film, because they mix truths into the fiction, we know for a fact that ancient society revered the sun, the seasons, and nature, and that the Egyptians had one of the earliest religions.However, they distort the truth in this section in order to paint a picture that simply isn't true. First of all, they claim that the reason Jesus is crucified on the cross during December is because the Sun passes through the Crux at that time.That is false, first of all the sun never passes through the Crux because the Crux is not a zodiacal constellation, and secondly it is mostly observed in the southern hemisphere (e.g Australia) and not in the Mediterranean countries this movie describes, so the Crux is probably not even the origin of the Cross in mythology.Besides that falsehood, the movie claims that Horus, Krishna, Attis, Mithra, and the like are all almost the same, which is an outright lie. First of all none of them were born on December 25!! Horus was born on around August 24, Krishna was born on July 21, and we don't even know when Jesus was born, the Christmas holiday is just there to celebrate the winter solstice. We don't know that that was the day Jesus was born.The next claim they make between these myths is that they share the Virgin Birth element, well that is not true, Krishna's father was Vasudeva, Horus's father was Osiris, Dionysus's father was Zeus, Mithra was born of a rock, we don't know that Attis's mother was a virgin, etc. This is all part of the fictional universe this movie depicts.Furthermore, Horus didn't have 12 disciples, he had 4 semi-divine followers, and 16 human followers, for a total of 20 followers, so this connection between Jesus and Horus is totally fabricated. You can find a connection between all sorts of deities from religions, the idea that they performed miracles, etc, but no correlation as major as the one this movie depicts.If any of these claims were corroborated they would be taught in every History class from here to Timbuktu. But these claims are not, because they are simply made up nonsense made to attract more viewers. Viewers that are attracted because it makes them think they know something that the majority of people don't, well you don't actually know anything from this that other people don't because it is false knowledge! To this day there have been hundreds of Egyptologists, Archaeologists, Historians, and scholars of a variety of fields working on this topic, studying Religions and looking for connections between them. Leave this to them, please, let the scholars do the work, don't just throw out the last hundred years of their work and pass this fiction story that was written in probably written in a couple weeks as truth.If you honestly do believe this is true, find the sources, find the corroboration, find the supporting evidence, and present it to Peter Joseph so he can add that to his film and his website, until then, you should outright reject all the new claims in this section of the film as they are unsubstantiated nonsense.(2). 9/11 Conspiracy I won't get into this part of the film very much, if you want to know more read a review of Loose Change or any of the thousands of documents out there refuting this conspiracy theory.Put quite simply, those buildings were not built to withstand a deliberate timed attack from planes that were full of fuel like that. The engineers who built the towers prepared for earthquakes, wind, and other natural phenomena, and they even prepared for the possibility of a airplane accidentally crashing into the building, but they certainly had no clue that such an act of terror would occur.(3). International Bankers This whole part of the film is to attract to people that consider themselves politically to be Anarcho-Capitalists, these people believe capitalism is the perfect system and if they just get rid of the evil group of bankers behind the federal reserve everything will be okay.And they make up lies in this part of the film too. Like the idea that J.P Morgan created the bank scare of 1908, and that there was a group of secretive bankers that conspired to create the federal reserve, and that the federal reserve created the great depression.Shortly after talking about the international banking cartels, they go into the war industry and how War is a Racket, a racket that businessmen have been using to make billions and billions of dollars for centuries, and that is true, however, they mixed that with fiction, fictional ideas about how the U.S government attacked itself and covered it up, which I agree the Nazis did, however, there is no evidence that the U.S made it the "norm." After talking about war, they bash the EU, NAU, AU, SAU, and the UN so it seems they have erroneously concluded that these unions are evil. What doesn't make any sense is a few minutes later in the conclusion of the film they urge unity.Finally, I agree that the people of the world should unite, take charge of their own lives, participate in society, and contribute, however, don't do it on the basis of ridiculous conspiracy theories!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Zealous Conspiracy Theories that Don't Apply its Critical Thinking to Itself</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It astounds me that this film can be so well received by so many people. As interested as I am in conspiracy theories, there's nothing worse than aimless hole picking, which is essentially what this documentary constitutes.Perhaps the most insulting examples concern 9/11 (and for the record, I'm not saying there's nothing dubious about the events). For every "fact" this doc questions, its ignorance towards its own questioning is infuriating. For there are counter-arguments to every "fact" it questions, but the doc fails to address them. Plus, a fact means little without a debate about motive. For if 9/11 is not what we think, then what is it? It is not enough to question veracity. People don't go to jail for lying about their alibi, motive is necessary. It's this kind of ignorance that can be applied throughout the documentary, and what leads to its ultimate failure.On an aesthetic level, the film is terrible. I understand that it's no-budget, but many sequences of archive and graphics are so heavy-handed and over-long that the doc, which has potentially exciting subject-material, actually feels boring. Plus, in the first section, many of the theories are not attributed to its creators, giving the narrator a false voice of authority.This project feels like an amateur conspiracy geek with little or no critical thinking faculties trying to give himself a voice, a voice that gives a bad name for the intelligent individuals who question the "official" theories in the correct manner.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Where are the Citations?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You can call me a cynic, but I need citations or some other proof of the "facts" presented in this "documentary. In the first 20 minutes a single citation is listed and then it only lists a person (G. Massey) and a job description (Egyptologist). From this the documentary appears either amateurish, or worse, deceptive.The film uses shocking images, quick edits, and an authoritative voice to persuade the audience. It is meant to influence the viewer affectively, not engage them intellectually. Facts that would counteract the argument are simply ignored, no attempt at balance is even given.Just one example, the film asks you to believe that crucifixion is the shared death of "sun/son" gods. This is categorically not the case. The film mentions Dionysus as such a typical deity, yet his death in Orphism was that of being cut to pieces and eaten by the Titans. Attis, another example, in Greek mythology died as a result of being gored in the thigh by a boar. Horus in Egyptian mythology died as the result of a scorpion sting.So check for yourselves, all you have to do is google some facts, heck the first two can be found in wikipedia under "orphism" and "Attis", the last one is found near the bottom of this page:http://www.touregypt.net/HORUS.HTM Simply put, it is lying to you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film that ranks with the religion it claims to expose as a crime against reason.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was referred to this film by a friend, who obviously assumed that because I am fairly anti religious, I'd be interested. They were mistaken. This movie is guilty of some of the most appalling logical fallacies and blatant cherry picking of factual information it has ever been my distinct displeasure to have observed. It is nothing short of terrible.Documentaries are a difficult animal at the best of times. Even very successful documentary makers often stray into very heavily opinion based presentation of a story while attempting to present an unbiased view. The medium offers people with a certain point of view not just the chance to portray their ideas, but the opportunity, when combined with careful editing and a clever accompanying marketing campaign, to portray their ideas in such a way that it discredits even the development of any dissenting ideas, on the grounds that anyone presenting such an idea is either ignorant, or actively in the employ of the enemy. If the film maker is really clever, they can even structure their film to lead you to the conclusion that they are being unjustly persecuted for attempting to reveal the horrible truth.This film is possibly the ultimate expression of this kind of conspiracy propaganda, presenting its ideas in a insultingly condescending manner, like a childhood bully attempting to goad a less assertive kid into something he knows is wrong, on the grounds it will make him cool. The comparison ends there though, because unlike drinking a fifth of bourbon and then setting fire to a bunch of neighborhood door mats, believing the crap that this film spews forth will not bring you street-cred with anyone who doesn't believe in unicorns.It required a substantial effort on my part to avoid breaking Godwin's while reviewing this film, and, as a nod to this, I strongly recommend burning all remaining copies of this film.As an aside, the use of the term Zeitgeist in the title of this movie is incomprehensible. I am a German speaker, and the definition of "zeitgeist" has nothing to do with the content of this film.</fullReview>

In short, if you disagree with the film makers, you must be stupid.I'm a very liberal person. I'm very liberated in my thinking. I'm a long term student of ancient history, nearly impossible to do without studying religion (Christian and otherwise) in depth. The stretching made by the film makers in linking their points was worthy of any Olympic Gymnast.This film is an affront to both historians and documentary film-makers in that both are discredited by their very tenuous association with the few facts inserted to substantiate the innuendo and half-truths presented by the film makers.If it wasn't so apparently earnest you would think the film makers intention was to create controversy for their own entertainment, not because they actually believed any of this rubbish.View this title with the requisite quantity of salt, or obligatory tinfoil hat, whichever you prefer.</fullReview>

Yes, people like to believe in conspiracy theories, and Zeitgeist plays on those tendencies skilfully. But it is just manipulative, dishonest and childish. The section on Christianity is bad, and it's all downhill from there. I can't believe that it has the nerve to make such patently dishonest claims.

		<shortDescription>How Can They Hear the Truth Above the Roar?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the musical 'Chicago,' Billy Flynn sings a song about how he thinks the world works: Just wow them, and they'll fall for it. This film is a prime example.It wows you by bombarding you over the head with images and sounds, quite shocking to the average viewer, and because of the way it is put together, it seems quite compelling. However, looking a bit closer after an initial viewing shows that the film is nothing more than paranoia-mongering.The film starts off with an 'overture,' in which music that sounds like that of Philip Glass (that is, if Philip Glass was stupid and drunk) plays over repeated images of explosions and other stock footage, eventually coming to the image of an airplane striking the World Trade Center, along with a picture of a hand writing "2+2=4," when other hands wrench the paper away from him, and replace it with a Bible and a folded American flag. It then fades to black with what looks like a Windows Media Player backdrop, where a is talking about 'establishments' that are meant to control you. It then moves to George Carlin's "Invisible Man in the Sky" monologue, before going into the film proper.The film consists of three parts: 1. The Greatest Story Ever Told 2. All The World's A Stage 3. Don't Mind The Men Behind the CurtainThe thing about the film is that it's very slickly edited. After it's overture, it seems to turn somewhat more mild. The very first four words of part one, spoken by the writer/composer/editor Peter Joseph: "This is the sun." From there, it moves on to talk about how Jesus was ripped off of several other deities from other civilizations, which are all identical sun gods, throwing in 'son god.' After spending time discussing Christianity and other religions, and coming to the conclusion that 'religion is the fraud of the age,' it moves to part 2, where it makes a very startling accusation indeed: The United States Government planned, carried out, and covered up the 2001 September 11th attacks. Then in part 3, it talks about the Federal Reserve, and how it has been behind all of our economic crises and wars, and how there is a 'New World Order' waiting to come and enslave us all.But the sad fact is, there is not a single original thought in this entire film. Part 1 is essentially a pitch for authors such as Dorothy Murdoch, aka Acharya S., who has written a number of books that argue Jesus never existed and was in fact plagiarized from earlier religions, a theory that has never been accepted by mainstream scholars.Part 2 is virtually indistinguishable from the myriad of 9/11 'Truth' Films - Loose Change, 9/11 Mysteries, etc.And Part 3 is essentially Aaron Russo's 'America: Freedom to Fascism.' Peter Joseph even takes Russo's word about the "RFID chip" that is supposed to be used to control us.And, it is about as factual as it is original. Here are just a few of the myriad of falsehoods in the film.1. A large bulk of the 'Jesus sun god' line in Part 1 rests on the contention that Jesus was born on December 25th. While that is the traditional date used for Christmas, no religious source actually gives a date. There were several dates used for celebration. Even today, many Orthodox Christians around the world celebrate Christmas on dates that are not December 25th, such as in January.2. In part 2, they make the contention that the hijackers are still alive. This was a very popular talking point for 9/11 conspiracy theorists for quite some time, but it is simply false. The source of this is a BBC article. After the list of suspected hijackers was released, some people with the same names as the suspected hijackers called in to voice their confusion. However, the fact of the matter is that they shared only the same name. The BBC later admitted that it was a case of mistaken identity. It also defies logic that these 'conspirators' would leave their 'hijackers' to blow the whistle in this manner.3. In part 3, it claims that there is not law that requires you to pay an income tax. This is a lie, plain and simple. It is right there in the Internal Revenue Code, for anyone who isn't lazy to read. This point was proved wrong when Russo said it, and Mr. Joseph has no excuse for repeating it.4. He says that the 16th Amendment is unconstitutional. Nobody seems to complain much about the other twenty-six Amendments, though (unless you're Ann Coulter and you think women shouldn't have the right to vote or something), which are all unconstitutional by similar standards.5. He talks about the cause of WWI, with the Lusitania. He talks about a conversation that seems to imply that the sinking of the Lusitania was planned. He argues that the Fed and the people behind it wanted the ship to sink so they could go to war. Well, he fails to say exactly what the 'men behind the curtain' did to cause it. He says that they wanted it to happen, but he does not offer a shred of evidence to support the notion that the 'men behind the curtain' caused it. Even more egregiously, he makes no mention of the Zimmerman Telegram. As influential as the sinking of the Lusitania was, it was the Telegram that caused the US to enter war.There are people who say that this is the most important documentary of our time, and others say that it doesn't matter if everything the film says is false, and that the point is that it makes you think about things.Lies do matter. And when this film that purports to destroy lies is made of lies itself, you need to reconsider the merits.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie is tendentious, possibly manage to a public longing to see conspiracies even in the soup (not denying they exist).Uses the facts into its convenience, an example: Horus NEVER dies, nor fight his uncle Set every day, in fact at age of 12, he was a mighty warrior capable of defeating his father's assassin, his uncle Set, his mother wasn't a virgin, wasn't crucify (the Egyptian doesn't do that) and he don't resurrect ('couse he wasn't death)neither has 12 disciple nor born on December 25th, 3000b.C (the "date of his birth is unknown because he's a mythical character. The other "facts" are, as they say, bullshit, if you going to watch the movie please do it whit criteria, 'couse if they talking about lies to sustain a system they do the same. By the way we are in the "age of Acuaruis" since the '60's or '70's, they wasn't Kings but Wise men from east, The myth of Gilgamesh is about a hero not the ark (ok, he's looking for an immortal man who survive the flood), the first part is full of bullshit and mockeries to try to prove a point.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>People, people, PEOPLE!!!! As the film suggests, don't take things at face value. Dig. Enquire. Find out for yourselves. The film is so badly skewed and full of hardcore manipulation of research and outright misinformation that it makes Michael Moore look objective.The film opens with sensationalist and disturbing footage, including shots of traumatised children, children with limbs blown off etc. This should provide at least some kind of warning that the following content is not going to be very objective..Then, from the very first point and set of facts, the makers simply made stuff up.The film opens by explaining how Horus, an Egyptian god was born on 25th December of a virgin, whose birth was marked by a star in the east, who was adored by three kings and that the story of Jesus was a Xerox copy of this. Rubbish, rubbish rubbish... I'm not going to tell you the story of Horus: look it up for yourselves. But I can say that the way it is depicted in the movie is, simply, crap. And it just gets worse from there on in.They may have made some interesting points during the movie but, if the film makers cannot find any evidence to support their case and they have to resort to completely making stuff up to prove their point, you have to ask yourself if they actually have any point to make at all.Don't you?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>When does healthy scepticism become crazy paranoia?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The belief in the Big Other as an invisible power structure is the most succinct definition of paranoia" - Slavoj Zizek We've seen these horror documentaries before. They all claim that a "secret cabal" is slowly conspiring to reduce human rights and enslave the world. They attempt to create a mono-myth, linking various conspiracies and hidden agendas into a single all-encompassing myth. A myth that explains the purpose and point and future of everything."Zeitgeist", which plays on the paranoia of the internet generation, itself implies that "evil politicians" and mysterious world leaders are secretly conspiring to oppress the human race. But the truth is, such leaders are themselves servants to invisible systems, and politicians aren't evil so much as they're products of a social system that is conducive of corruption."Zeitgeist's" first act is essentially a short lecture on religion. It's overly sensationalistic, but the documentary's point is generally true: religions evolve over time, our current religions borrow heavily from past myths, and religion is itself simultaneously a tool for control, an elaborate shared psychosis, a social support network and a means for placating various existential anxieties."Zeitgeist's" second act is it's weakest. Here we get an elaborate critique of the "official 9/11 narrative", the film-makers analysing and debunking various aspects of the 2001, September 11th terrorist attacks. The jury's still out on all this."Zeitgeist's" third act is perhaps its most important. Here the film-makers critique various aspects of money creation, banking cartels and debt based currency. These points are all correct, of course, but amount to a fairly superficial critique of capitalism. The truth's worse, and far more shocking - capitalism is itself a shared psychosis - albeit in a prosaic way. One's far better off reading books by thermoeconomists, steady-state advocates and any neo-Marxist radically aligned against neoclassical economists.In a more general, philosophical sense, "Zeitgeist" is false to imply that there is some conscious, scheming "order" out to get you. There is no order. These "evil conspirators" - which is not to say that shady figures don't commit conspiratorial crimes; they do, they're just don't quite know what they're doing - are every bit slaves to unconscious drives and physical currents. The actual entity doing the controlling does not exist. There is no Big Other, no master plan or entity in possession of secret knowledge."Zeitgeist" goes on to say that human beings will "accept this new order" because Americans are dumb, "mindless slaves" addicted to "pleasure seeking activities". Essentially this echoes Marx's ideas that a comfortable populace will never challenge its rulers for fear of rocking the boat and losing the few amenities it has. There's much truth in that (and also the opposite; as capitalism sucks more wealth up the pyramid, people have less and become more violent). And yet, according to sociological investigations, people are increasingly finding less and less pleasure in recreational activities. This growing indifference towards intense pleasure contrasts with the official view that our society is bent on instant gratification. Lacan and Marcuse foresaw this decades ago, when they essentially stated that subjects who dedicate their lives to pleasure would increasingly become so involved in preparatory activities that the joy of the official goal of their efforts fades away. We see this today, with millions obsessed with prolonging youth/beauty/pleasure, yet obviously living in permanent anxiety and under the shadow of ultimate failure. Today the command "Enjoy!", the motto of capitalism, is a much more effective way to hinder man's access to enjoyment than out-right prohibition, which maintains a space for transgression. The lesson is that the selfish "care of the Self," and not a "repressive group of conspirators", is the ultimate enemy of intense pleasure experiences. Man's dream Utopia, where he whimsically takes part in every conceivable, masturbatory pleasure, will increasingly morph into a kind of apathetic Antonioni-like boredom. The direct intervention of pain (weird sado-masochistic sexual practises etc) or the escalations of perversions, now seem the only remaining paths to intensity.Thus, the fact that "The Big Other" doesn't exist, has two consequences. Firstly, the failure of symbolic fiction causes man to cling more and more to imaginary Simulacra (films, computers etc), and secondly, it triggers the need for violence of the body (ie Cronenberg). Bizarrely, we see these themes of repression, sexuality, knowledge and utopia in the Bible. In Genesis, Adam and Eve tended to the Garden (society), obediently doing their duty and obeying the orders of God (bureaucracy). They were naked, repressed and stupid, but they had food and water and enough kinky Biblical entertainment to keep them busy. Along came Satan, the story's actual hero. He taught them the truth: that it is wise to eat from the Tree of Knowledge. And so Adam and Eve taste the fruit, gain wisdom, develop a moral sense, learn of their nakedness and challenge God. In the real world, society is perhaps evolving backwards toward this Eden State. Man doesn't want to eat from the Tree of knowledge, but wants his own isolated utopia, with the right balance of abundance, myopia and external Law. What's more, he wants all his troubles, decisions and fears to be taken care of by a paternalistic God, where God represents bureaucracy and the symbolic Order. The irony is, our current social models cannot support this (it will take 6-10 planet earths worth of resources just to provide a middle class life for everyone currently on the planet). This creates little Satan's out of us all, everyone waiting in the wings, perhaps to be awakened and sent clawing at God.5/10 - Scepticism is good, but this is mostly a sensationalist horror movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie stayed with me and became a factor in the continual religious and spiritual conversation in my head. If you wish to explore the truth about the history of man and religion and to learn things you will not be taught in school or church this is an excellent resource. Of course, you will have to question all you hear, but much of what you hear will also make you question what you thought you knew.An essay in three parts, the first was most educational to me and does continue to effect my outlook toward organized religion. The second part failed to bring me completely on board and was not as well tied together, leaving a feeling of conspiracy theory regarding the origins of so much human violence. The third part of the essay soundly thrashes the current pervasive view of the world and exposes our complacency under economic subjugation beautifully.I recommend this movie to all but believe you will have to be somewhat free of the corporate media to be able to really hear it. Anyone who does question the reality of the current religious and military paradigm we live under will be bolstered and possibly even entranced into making it their new view of history. Anyone open to hearing this movie who was not already enlightened will feel their eyes have been opened and want to share it with everyone they know.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What does Christianity, 911 and The Federal Reserve all have in common? 'Divide &amp; Conquer' is the 'Motto'. The social manipulation of society, through the generation of fear and division, has completely detached humans from their sense of power and reality.The movie's narrator says it all:Narrator: The most incredible aspect of all: these totalitarian elements will not be forced on people, the people will demand them. Narrator: The last thing the men behind the curtain want is a conscious informed public capable of critical thinking. Which is why a continually fraudulent zeitgeist is output via religion, the mass media, and the educational system. They seek to keep you in a distracted, naive bubble. And they are doing a damn good job of it. Narrator: Christianity, along with all other theistic belief systems, is the fraud of the age. It serves to detach the species from the natural world, and likewise, each other. It supports blind submission to authority. Narrator: Nothing is more profitable for international bankers than war. Narrator: The bottom line is this: The Vietnam war was never meant to be won. Just sustained. This war for profit resulted in 58,000 American deaths and 3 million dead Vietnamese. A 'must see'!

		<fullReview>Icredible. That's the correct term to describe this documentary. As said in the storyline, Zeitgeist is constituted by three parts, in a first look, very distinctive, but that in the end all serve the exact same purpose. The beginning of the first part describes the religion in a general fashion, slowly centering the argument in Christians. In a very mature and culturistic way, it makes you think if all that you've been taught by your family as a kid, concerning god, is indeed truth. The second part discusses 9/11, by showing the viewer all the recordings, statements and testimonies hidden by the government so far, that they didn't want you to see, stating that it was in fact, a way of finding an excuse to subsequently going in to war with Iraq, with one very simple purpose. Oil, which leads to importation, which leads to money. And which leads to the third part of this documentary, that talks about that very same thing, money. The third part is about how money is generated and how crisis are created, by telling the story about how the Federal Reserve of the United States was originated, what is it's purpose, and who has been behind it until now days. In general, it clearly tells the spectator who how and why is behind the curtains of this huge theater we call world economy. My advice to all the readers who are thinking about watching this spectacular documentary, is to actually watch it, and think. Think about the big picture that is this stage you're acting in, without even taking notice. But think about it with an open mind, and don't take everything as the only truth, do some research by yourself. Believe me, its worth your while.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>interesting ... but lacking</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a very interesting movie, and i say that as a good and as a bad. It has its goods and its bads. I've seen many documentaries and many movies on the subject of Christianity and this one has the worst explanations. Those 20 minutes could not convince anyone about the scam behind religion especially because many facts described in the movie are erroneous; going through history books and Encyclopaedias anyone can see that his statements about Christianity are irrelevant. I am an atheist but the first part in the movie is bogus and even I didn't get convinced from what I've seen. The movie stresses the fact that people are becoming dumber and more gullible and that we should open our eyes and think for ourselves and don't believe everything that we see on the TV, Net or newspapers. Here the movie contradicts itself. It presents facts and ideas that are not thoroughly supported and i think that the BIGGEST mistake was the ending. Here the movie becomes very subjective and draws conclusions about what's happening in the world. This is a fiasco as the movie is trying to tell us about the way we just take information without questioning it and that we are ignorants, now we have to take the movie for granted and prepare for the worst. I think that another big problem is the fact that this movie has no solid sources. It cannot prove anything even though many of these facts can be true they can't be proved and it would probably be really hard for them to prove especially if these problems exist at such high levels(people tend to cover their tracks pretty good especially on this level) so even if some things depicted are true people won't know what to believe because of the subjectivity of the author. I think people will ask themselves throughout the movie : is this the author being paranoid, or is this the government mocking everyone, and the way the author "destroyed" religion in just 20mins doesn't help the credibility of the movie. Bottom line is that it's interesting but it's best to form an own option from the movie not just take it as it is</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a hobby student of philosophy and culture I actually looked up the first 5 myths compared to Jesus Christ and found everything to be pure fiction/made up; but I researched it just to make sure.The narrator mixes one fact or two (usually just the name of a myth like Horus or Dionysus) with 7 to 10 totally concocted fallacies.The author would have you believe that every major myth was born on December 25th. Including Horus of Egypt - 3000 BC and and Mythris of Persia 1200 BC. I believe that the whole "December 25th and Julian calendar Thing" weren't even created or thought of until 45BC by the Romans or at least Julias Ceazar. I know you can still have a date but....Irregardless of your religious convictions, the facts or lack thereof makes this mockumentary worse that a B rated college-level, campy-horror spoof.A gullible 4th grader might enjoy debating something like this.People who see a psychiatrist on a regular basis might enjoy watching this as well to provide some satirical conversational fodder with their shrinks.But I suppose on the bright side: If you really wanted to be "brain washed" I would prefer you watch something like this as opposed to an "American Sucks" production by Al-Queda.Otherwise these are the lamest conspiracy theories I've ever seen or heard of.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Divided in three sections: Religion, 9/11 and the economical system, or should I say the banking system, this documentary is very informative. It starts rather annoyingly though with a cacophony of sounds and pictures of war and whatever. Way, way too long. After over 30 seconds of that, I fast forwarded on Netflix until it got to the crux of the presentation: Religion. Religion is evil, we are told. Completely agree, but I learned far more than I thought I would. Then came the Truth about the 9/11 attack on the World Trade Center. Great stuff. I had more or less accepted the official version, but after what I heard, I realized I have been fed bullshit. The arguments made for the alternate version (whatever it is) are quite compelling. I never liked Bush and Cheney, but what I heard there make the evil emperor and Darth Vader in Star Wars look tame by comparison. On the Central Bank, the third part, my knowledge in this area is less than adequate to judge the veracity of this alternate vision. As a result, I found the argumentation tedious and a tad to pat to be convincing. As good as it is, this documentary would have been much better with about 15 minutes chopped off. But it does make you think, a lot.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This world really has gone mad if they pay to influence the opinions even in the _seemingly_ free Internet. This movie does not deserve 1 star on any scale and everyone who has seen it knows that pretty well. The main reason behind this is to help all us -- the brainwashed people to question our lives and our beliefs and this is what the world really needs right now. It's painful for many of you to think these atheistic thoughts it is enrages that someone could come to the conclusion that there is no god and no real purpose under him. You've been fed all this beliefs right from the childhood and the childhood memories are the most treasured and the hardest to part with. We've got no beliefs when we born and the only real gods we know are our parents and if these parents tell us something it will forever be the only true Word for us. Thus the religion continues to exist: by passing from the parents to their children. But the person who considers himself a human needs to have his own point of view, his own beliefs and disbeliefs and some brain cells intact. Otherwise he will be a solder in the army of anyone who can make him believe something or can exploit his previous believes. And all the soldiers sooner or later go to war: be it to rate 1/10 a movie, burn a 'witch' or attend a Ku-Klux-Klan meeting. If you cannot find the strength to speak about atheism openly, to try to critique it or to weight your own thoughts about it, -- at least find some decency not to blindly deny it to the others around you. You may live in your own shell but stop trying to force people around you to do the same. Maybe humankind is still too young to give up its faith in Santa Claus but we are matured enough to be able to destroy the planet so we have to grow fast and learn to be open-minded; otherwise we can doom the next generation to live in the nuclear waste. The least pleasant group of reviewers here are those who just deny the whole story calling it nonsense. These people have clearly been paid for their 'reviews'. You cannot rate this lower than 4/10 because at any rate it contains some good thoughts and serves as a catalyst to your thinking apparatus. So at least they are very biased and not in the good way.As for the movie itself it's doing a good job in what it was intended for: to make you think. Yes, it carries the information the same propagandistic way we've seen in the opposite camp. But it contain good summary of information provided with facts and evidence. This two hours 'drivel' compiles a heap of sources into one stream. The information attacking us from the screen is so abundant and deep that we cannot comprehend it fully in one go. The movie is definitely must be watched more than ones or twice and every time it will enrich your experience in the land of disbelief. You know that the true purpose of this is not the revolution; it is to help you open your eyes in the kingdom of the blind and be a human being, god damn it!</fullReview>

A question needing to be addressed is why the myth in the first place? As with the "grand conspiracy" it also has to be asked, for what end? Money and power does not answer that question as the conspirators already have those. But the movie does ask questions and makes one ponder which can never be a bad thing. Always question authority! Always remember aspects of power as in Kent State, Ruby Ridge, and Waco, just to name a few. The movie is put together well and is compelling to watch.

The makers of this film just love dictatorship and telling people what to think which is why they are so cross that America got involved in the second world war - they think dictatorship makes things easier. Great bit of Athena poster conclusion at the end 'shouldn't we just all love everyone'.

		<fullReview>While it's full of conspiracy thinkers, it's better to listen and take in what they're saying rather than keeping yourself out in the dark. You don't have to agree with what they are saying, but at less give yourself an open mind when watching this film. The more you know, the better. Having watch, both right wing and left wing documentaries, these movies does have more standards of journalistic integrity than the others. Directed by Peter Joseph, the Zeitgeist documentary style films (2007's Zeitgeist the Movie, 2008's Zeitgeist: Addendum &amp; 2011's Zeitgeist: Moving Forward) are all pretty well-made films, that does give light into a lot of things that hasn't been talk about, much. Most of things talk about in the films, I found interesting and agree often on, but sadly, the first film is in the series, is by far, the weakest one of them, all. It felt too out there to be taken serious. It's also badly put-together. Zeitgeist: The Movie is split into 3 parts with showcase how Western Civilization is control. The first part talks about how the Abrahamic religions (Christianity, Islam, Judaism and the Bah' Faith) control people, using Christianity as an example. Yes, historic, it's true that many of the modern day religions do hold some control over people, but it has little differents if paganism or an atheism society came into control. In such a society, control would still be manual for society to exist. Is giving control to a higher power, a bad thing? Not always. Having faith in something doesn't make it, all bad. Without it, we wouldn't have the wonders of cultures. Does civilization need to more from religion like beliefs to a science like belief to achieve greater means? It's really up in air. About Christian religion specifically is mainly derived from other religions, astronomical assertions, astrological myths and traditions. Yes, part of the Jesus myth does, but it also derived to those events that Jesus went through. Peter Joseph forget to mention that. Indeed, there were some historical proves that Jesus might have live. Is he a deity? That's for another debate. However, some of the parts that director Peter Joseph bring up is either distorted, out of context, or completely made up. Some of his sources are also either non-existent or heavily biased. Still, this sequence was pretty alright. The next sequence is the one that really bogged me down. The movie lost so much credit, when it talks about the 9/11 attacks in 2001. It states that it was orchestrated by the US government in order to generate mass fear, initiate and justify the War on Terror, provide a pretext for the curtailment of civil liberties, and produce economic gain. Let me break this illusion, down. This film has no credible information because the film didn't add anything new to already well-spoken conspiracy theories that been surrounding 9/11 since that day. It didn't go to Washington D.C, Pittsburgh, or New York crash sites to search for clues, and it damn didn't go to Afghanistan. Let's note that this film is created in 2007, so it's a bit outdated. There are a lot of documentaries that came after this, that pretty much show that there is no way, the US government could had done an attack like that. It would first be costly. Let's remember the years after 2001 had an economic bust than a boom. Second off, war isn't as profitable as it was in the old days due to technology grown in the private fields. Third, if the government did do it, do you really think that all those people would cover up a horrible act for so long? NO?somebody will come out. I do think there are honestly some good people in the government. I don't think our government planned 9/11, but perhaps they knew, some information of the terrorist attack ahead and couldn't stop it happening. Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying trust your government! I might be against the idea that the government did 9/11, but no way, believe everything they say. I do know about the government covering up events in the past before, such as the 1964's Gulf of Tonkin incident, the whole Operation Northwoods, the whole pre-knowing of Pearl Harbor, and even the Remember the Maine incident. The film asserts that such wars serve to sustain conflict in general and force the U.S. government to borrow money, thereby increasing the profits of the international bankers. I do think the banks do have too much power, and need to be review badly. Still, if an secretive power elite like the Rothschild's family had a globalist agenda conspiring to eventually rule the world, then why do the Rothschild wealth have subsequently declined. They lose more money than gain. That's why I don't think all bankers are evil like the film says. Even, if the banks have control, why are we able to watch film like this? It would be total George Orwell's 1984 state by now. While, I'm not against Globalization, and capitalism, I don't think it's as evil as the documentary state it is. We do enjoy some freedoms under a capitalism system. I'm not the biggest fan of it, or socialism, personally. I do have to believe that some kind of order is better world than total chaos like the film wish to have. Capitalism is no different than religion. It works because people believe it works. If the people in charge didn't believe in it, it would quickly show its flaws and fall apart. At some point I dream people can abolish the monetary system completely, instead use automatic systems which would monitor all the useable resources on the planet like the Venus Project, but it will take years of economic evolution for such ideas to be successful. With that, go see these films. Can we believe in absolutely everything that these films say? Obviously not. But it's worth looking at and do your own research.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Zeitgeist creates it's own 'facts'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I feel compelled to write this review in the hope that others are not unknowingly fed with lies; the documentary clearly makes the assumption that the viewer will not research the content.Ironically this is in part exactly what the documentary itself attacks.I do not know much about Horus or Mithras, but I do have partial knowledge of Dionysus, all of whom the documentary claim Jesus was pretty much an exact copy of.Realising what the documentary was saying about Dionysus was incorrect, I decided to do a bit of research into the other gods. As suspected, Zeitgeist creates it's own 'facts' as it goes along to fit its agenda.It also talks about the Crux (Southern Cross). This, to the best of my knowledge, in not ever visible in the Northern Hemisphere; Zeitgeist makes the claim that the Crux is fundamental to the period of resurrection of the above mentioned gods. How the ancient civilizations in the Northern Hemisphere were able to see the Crux is beyond me.I did not have the will to research other parts of the documentary, but given the level of inaccuracies and the number statements that are not based on any truths in the first 30 minutes alone, I suspect the theme continued throughout.I have nothing against conspiracy theories, however implausible, but Zeitgeist decides to take it upon itself to literary make up 'truths'.At best it makes people question what is around us, but most likely it will leave viewers with false knowledge that will no doubt be fed on to others.Watch Zeitgeist if you must, but please take what you hear with a pinch of salt.I can only give this a 1 as it is as guilty as the religious texts it spends so long criticizing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Institutions Are Not Your Friend</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some films seek to entertain. "Zeitgeist" seeks to inform. This sociological documentary contains a wealth of facts. And these facts function to support its overall message; namely, that powerful, societal institutions, through action and speech, control individuals in unimagined ways. For what purpose? Power. The film singles out religious institutions, government institutions, and financial institutions.The film's first segment, 28-minutes in duration, is unparalleled in its succinct yet potent discussion of religion, and its relation to history and current culture. Splendid narration, background music, and visuals make this segment spellbinding. But more importantly, the message is factual and nothing short of profound.The segments on government and financial institutions are scarcely less significant. The focus is on the 9/11 tragedy at the World Trade Center. Viewers who adhere to the official line will no doubt protest. But they cannot alter the facts that point to a conspiracy of powerful institutional leaders. The banking/financial segment follows suit with a similarly scathing critique."Zeitgeist" hammers television. From the film "Network" (1976), the character Howard Beale shouts the evils of the "boob-tube"; "Television is not the truth; television is an ... amusement park"; its output is designed to keep you in a distracted, naive bubble.The film is not perfect. Discussion of 9/11 will eventually make the film dated. The first four-minute segment is sleep inducing. A few spots of filler could have been replaced with further critiques of the media. And most importantly, what the film calls "lies" (as a noun) in some instances could be replaced with the word "ignorance". Yet, whether the evil is ignorance or lies, the end result is the same.Ordinarily, these imperfections would reduce my rating from a perfect score of ten. But the overall message of "Zeitgeist" is so profound and the presented facts so stunning that I cannot justify a score less than the highest possible.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was tempted to write short review, so I try to be as short as possible:This is only my thought, anyway in compliance with the movie i would like to motivate to watch it and think about it and everything in your life:Many people do not believe in everything they hear, read or watch and probably they would think the same for this movie. Many people need a clue just to make sure that something is real.I'll say only this: If someone wants to control you, do you think that person would like you to know that you've been controlled? well of course NO, so starting from there, try to watch this movie like a alternative reality which goes behind our back, and not to watch it as a skeptic or a "conspiracy theory". just watch and try to compare the hidden facts that this movie present to us to our every day life. Nothing happens without a reason, and almost 6 years after this movie "predicted" the future, EXACTLY that is happening to us every day. Latest event is the new world crisis..which bothers us every day, holds us in fear that we should do what exactly "they" want us to do...what is the crisis? does it beats you when it meats you on the streets, what it does? Well it is an instrument that holds us in fear. What is the euro or amero, why is "everyone" (or just few people in fact) tending to merge whole world...Oh and why did they want to implement "internet police" because just of the same reasons..CONTROL. What was the word they used - "LEGISLATION", What I've learned so far...whenever I meet word "LEGISLATION" means that those few people from behind want to FORCE control over US and endangers our civil rights.Watch this movie and think about it..it does not need to be 100% true, but it will give you an idea and meaning behind your life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is not a documentary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, I will commend the author of this power-point presentation for his technique. It is a fast moving documentary, revealing the true nature of religion, terrorism and federal banking. During this 2 hour piece, proof is presented that Christianity is basically just another clone of every other religion out there, that 9/11 was an inside job, that income tax is unconstitutional, and that Pearl Harbor was provoked intentionally by America. These revelations would have made this the single greatest documentary ever made, if it were not for one minor flaw: it is all complete and utterly fabricated.After watching the movie and doing (surprisingly little) research, it becomes evident that roughly 90% of the arguments presented as fact in this 'documentary' are completely made up. I won't present any examples here, but several sites already exist that debunk the entire film.Now, the falsehoods in this film are so blatant and severe that they cannot be the product of an under researched script - they have to be made with the intent of misleading the audience.Frankly, I am amazed that tinfoil hats can be made with sufficient thickness that people can actually believe this. I would previously have thought that such an amount of aluminum foil would have snapped the neck of whoever attempted to wear such a hat.So in that respect, I suppose I learned something by watching this movie.In summary, watch this movie if: A) You *know* that 9/11 was an inside job and you want someone to agree with you. B) You process critical thinking and you need a good example of what can be done with clever editing and complete disregard for facts.In either case, you may have a good time. But if you find that you have changed your mind about anything after watching this movie, I beg that you read both sides of the argument.However, since this documentary so obviously has an agenda, I cannot with good conscience good it a good rating. But I would say it is definitely in the 'so bad it's good' category.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the most ridiculous documentaries I have seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First, I must start by stating that I believe conspiracies do exist and that people in power have the means to pull them off. So this documentary from that standpoint is not what is ridiculous about this whatsoever. However, as a documentary, it is extremely biased and many of the facts presented are intentionally twisted by the filmmaker in order to make his point. Yet, for a documentary with the supposed goal in mind of thinking for yourself, he tries very hard for you to see things his way.The first part of this "documentary" focuses on religion, except that he spouts assumption and, in most cases that he cites as "fact" are nothing more than his own conjecture. The Bible doesn't say Jesus was born on December 25th or that He was visited by three wise men from the East. These are assumed but never stated, as they are passed down by tradition. Plus the filmmaker makes many factual errors concerning the other religions and mythologies mentioned. Of course these are all done to convey his own point, yet keeps telling us we need to think for ourselves.The rest of this "documentary" makes similar leaps in logic. Again, I am not saying that real conspiracies don't exist. I just happen to find it rather convenient that they all tie together in a manner that the filmmaker suggests. When taken altogether this is hardly a compelling piece of work. With so much factually wrong yet espoused as fact at the beginning I really can't see how anyone can take the rest of it seriously.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not particularly pretty or easy to watch, indeed much of it is blank screen or some weird graphic. Audio overlays text and it gets confusing, too much information bombarding us too quickly.The message however is clear and for the most part believable. Occasionally, especially near the end, it gets a bit preachy and almost flower-powery, denting the credibility somewhat.Anybody with a brain should be able to see some truth in this, though it over-simplifies our very complex world. The only real weakness in the arguments is of course that a similar medium is being used to attack the powers, as is being used by those powers that control us.People will believe what they want to believe, and even if you believe most of this (as I do) you must also believe there is not much we can do about it. Having said that, I think we need a revolution and I shall be right at the front of it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pointing out the problem and gives solutions</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Among many comments people said about this movie is that it is based on unsupported evidence. I would correct them and say it is based on "unsupported main stream evidence". Main stream people do not read, they take by grant and true everything that comes out from TV. The facts are out there already in printed paper. Very good books about the matter are World Orders, Old and New by Noam Chomsky and The grand chessboard by Zbigniew Brzezinski. Many weird things are happening through out History. But to speak about the problem without providing a solution or even without doing something about it is kind of trivial. This movie proposes a solution. A new kind of system based on natural resources and technology, that actually I like it. However starting tomorrow it would take 200-500 years from now. I would like to see a change during my lifetime. At the very end the ones that control the world and decide where it goes are our selves, the common people. The corporations are like religions, without clients they are dead. We control the world by WHICH products we buy and WHERE we buy them. Buying cheap products made somewhere else than the place we live makes the money go away. We have the last word to promote or not sweatshops. We keep the wealth in our neighborhood by buying products in the local shops and even from local producers. The answer is actually very easy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is absolutely one of my favorite movies of all time. It's an extremely compelling examination of many of the "institutions" that our society is controlled and influenced by.As a born skeptic, the first time I watched this I doubted that the claims made in the movie could be true, mostly because of how disturbing they were. It has since become an absolute staple of my small DVD collection and is a movie I watch quite often. Not to say that it is completely true (after all, how do you define "truth"), only that the arguments in it are absolutely compelling and WILL cause you to re-evaluate the major institutions of the US, and of the world.One point made is that the media is controlled by the same groups that control everything else, so if you base your perception of "truth" on what you see on the news and TV, you are allowing yourself to be deceived.Even if you saw this and didn't believe one word of it, it would at least convince you to re-evaluate your current beliefs and disprove points made in the movie. This will hopefully lead you to the truth, which may or may not be in line with your current beliefs. And for this reason alone this movie is worth watching, and re-watching several times.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Zeitgeist is one of the most powerful documentaries that I have seen in the recent years. It's beautifully organized and incredibly subtle despite the drastic and controversial themes it touches on. Its authors are not imposing their views on you, their arguments are lucid and convincing. Those who claim that Zeitgeist is no more than anti-Christian propaganda and another conspiracy theory are not fair, and they are aware of it. Anyway, the film is not about Christianity, but about being lied to, about the power of lies, and about our being naive, our inability to distinguish between the authority based on truth and the truth based on authority. As for 9/11, Zeitgeist will show you what you think but are afraid to say. I wonder which corporate TV will have the guts to broadcast it first. The rumor has it BBC is thinking of showing it soon. I doubt it, though.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How many sources does the Bible or any other religious scripture actually cite? The answer of course is zero, yet when anyone wishes to challenge the (often misinterpreted) word of 'God' they have to use fully referenced sources for argument, I'm sure we can all appreciate the imbalance in this. But then that is how religion has managed to propagate it's lies so effectively, by stifling fact with faith and offering only punishment for those who question the establishment past what is deemed acceptable.Anyway, despite this if the only fault the author of the previous comment can find with Zeitgeist is in part 1 then that still leaves well over an hour of well researched, well presented ideas, challenges and facts that I believe everyone should consider.I took the main point from Zeitgeist to be 'question everything and don't accept what is fed to you without first understanding where it comes from' - surely any sensible person would accept the inherent truism in that statement. It takes an all together different person to begin to act on it though.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have watched Zeigeist two times all the way through, and have watched Part I several times. I agree with whoever it was who said that it is improper to take anything said from any one single source as fact. It's true, that Zeitgeist offers many ideas that imply the viewer to become convinced that the world is run by a few economic and political masters who manipulate the unthinking populaces of the world through the tools of religious myth and war. So far, I have found no evidence that suggests that these ideas presented in Zeitgeist are false.More importantly, I have come to the conclusion that the purpose of this movie was not just to inform the viewers of many secretive facts and information, but to encourage the viewer to think critically about their world and not blindly accept everything that the majority professes as fact.Zeitgeist has done just that. It tests the viewer of detaching from what they may have always thought to be reality and encourages them to think for themselves; a great movie for anyone interested in seeking truth.</fullReview>

You don't destroy your own suspense and tension, that would make you a rubbish film maker.At the end of the day it contains a lot of information which I don't care if it's fact or not, nor am I going to spend my time finding out.

		<fullReview>Zietgeist is a documentary about the times we live in and how we got here. I found Part 2 and 3 very interesting, informative, and eye opening. Part one was an attack on Christianity which I found unfair, why single out Chritianity when all religions have their faults.Part 1 Deals with the Christian Religion, basically claiming that it is a myth based on other myths, that Jesus was a fictional character, then goes on to list the injustices and atrocities the catholic church has committed. *********RANT**************Yes the Catholics and Christians cleansed a lot of the world, but what about Muslims and Hindus fighting or Bhuddists in China etc. Every religion has their flaws. The Bible is not there to be taken literally, but to be a guide for us. Christianity is a beautiful where of life (like any other religion) and it brings just as much good as bad. The Church is an institution, and all institutions have their own agenda's...don't confuse Religion, Church, Bible and Sprituality, they are 4 different things.Part 2 Deals with a very touchy subject, Sept.11th attacks. Joeseph is trying to show that it was an inside job, perpetrated or at least allowed by the top levels of U.S Govt. He hit the nail on the head on this part. You can actually see parts where the explosives are going off before the buildings fell....plus the fire fighters and police (the real hero's of 9/11) talking about bombs going off. He also asks about Building 7 which fell for no reason. And asks how congress can accept the bogus 9/11 report. It's a hard reality to face, but the u.S govt is not only corrupt, but criminal. The U.S government destroyed the WTC so they could go into Afganistan and Iraq and steal oil and grow heroin...there's not a doubt in my mind that this is true.Part 3 Is so very enlightening...it talks about the world banking cartels and how they took over the U.S government a long time ago. Very, Very informative. Joseph explains economics very simply, but never the less correct. (yes I took economics)Over all a great film, yes it has some flaws, and the doc. is definitely biased, but with the subject matter it's trying to speak on, it has to be.On top of everything Peter Joseph has made this film available for free. Please search for it online and check it out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Zetigeist: The Movie' is actually 3 documentaries in one.There are three parts here, the first one, dealing with religion, seems to be the one that gets the most attention. It puts forth the notion that modern Christianity is in fact strongly linked to a long tradition of death/rebirth religions dating back millennia - long before the birth of Christ.The second documentary here is the most conspiracy-minded, suggesting that the 9/11 attacks were much more complicated and raise many more questions than the official 9/11 Commission Report relates.The third documentary is the most timely given the (at the time of this writing) calls for investigation of the Federal Reserve. It deals with the founding and operations of that National Banking system, and its inherent flaws.This film is definitely worth a look. There are certainly problems with it - it glosses over meticulous research in favor of a more accessible, watchable, narrative flow. But if one takes it as a beginning point - a film that brings up the questions that one can further research on one's own, rather than as a reference book, it can be a very enlightening experience.If one enjoys this film, there seems to already be at least one sequel 'Zeitgeist Addendum' which further delves into the state of society today.</fullReview>

It is a great time for life to shift to a new way of thinking and be what we could have been without the antagonism of religion. The Mayan Calender ends on December 21st, 2012 at 11:11-The Winter Solstice. Its translation into our time equals 13.0.0.0.0. Something has got to change. Have we all forgotten those jets flying into the World Trade Center and how nothing has really been told or truly explained? Does paying our debt truly distract us from what is going on? Zeitgeist is a philosophical narrative on the state of who are we are and where we came from and where we are going in the age of Pisces. It shows us how we are easily deceived and can be made to believe in anything. Remember we are just mature monkeys and Human beings can be made to believe in anything if we're affected as children. Imagine being raised in a KKK family or a Catholic Family, Islam, or worse, a Baptist family like this critic...oh the suffering...Imagine what you could have been without those inventions of hate and deceit? Zeitgeist is suggesting to those who are aware of this illusion of existence that the times are about to change. Who wants the world to continue that forces pills, usury, plastic surgery, vanity, greed, drugs, commercialism, materialism...down our throats as if this is what our intention was when the Human spirit has so much more to offer the individual as we begin to realize that we do exist in heaven.Watch this movie and think about it.

Zeitgeist must not be 100% correct, but it is at least very consistent with the FACTS we see nowadays, on the other hand, politicians speeches seem to be almost always false, and those who try to say the truth are eliminated one way or another. This is a must watch documentary for everyone, specially Americans. Watch and do something about it. Thoughts without actions are a waste of time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Excellent film, &amp; message " We are all one"Kudos to Peter Joseph and the cast for establishing this amazing cinema! I have read some of the comments from critics, of how unbearable it was to watch this film. In my honest opinion, I believe this film inspired me and it's a must see. The evidence is there, the developer obviously did his research. SHAME on the critics who did quick research on Wikipedia...and believe it has all the answers. SHAME on religious/ridiculous human organizations who stand up for what they believe in such a selfish, &amp; stubborn matter(Faith)in RELIGION(money making business) that has exaggerated claims and promises... and tricks humans who are completely oblivious of what is in nature and reality.. and until my justification is proved other wise religion is false under my jurisdiction . This film is meant to enlighten the human mind. It mentions how humans are one, and it gives results of how the media controls the nation &amp; fooling the nation full of stupidity into submission.The movie provides details on how the story of Jesus Christ supposedly our savior is complete plagiarism from other myths. It gives reason in which the world is a stage that is developed from our masters to monitor and manipulate people into progressing the agenda of the men behind the curtain. It states how there is fraud and corruption in America and the rest of the world that is full of greed.Eye opening inspiration, 9/10"Any fool can criticize, condemn and complain--and most fools do." ?

		<fullReview>This documentary is very well made. There is so much said and proved threw facts and images that really makes you wonder about the truth of various events in history and present. This is the kind of documentary that really takes you to a next level, from literary the beginning of time to what is currently happening in the world as we speak. Thus stunning and brilliant but never the less debatable, because of the different beliefs that surrounds us today and that is also narrated in this film.Now obviously every one has a different point of view on how the world works and how we see it, but also we cant help it but believe in the media and technology that is offered to us in a daily basis because well It sad to say it but what we see is what we get but definitely not what we deserve, or at least that is one of the points that this film is trying to get at, but the conclusion to this film is not very clear , does it want us to change our political, religious , and historical beliefs or does it want us to hate the world and people who live in it for making us believe in something that we are not, or for us to join as a one world population to seek the peace that we all deserve before we all destroy each other, not very clear but well made. All in all a great film that will stir up controversy within you and whom ever sees it!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a very good movie in the fact or portraying a good ideal of what is happening in the world today. One world government is well on its way in my opinion already - but it is also good to research the claims on Jesus Crist a bit more. Being that the bible itself has predicted many of these events already. The RFID chip, Rev 13:17 speaks that all the nations will be together, and everyone will have to have one to buy and sell(He required everyone-small and great, rich and poor, free and slave- to be given a mark on the right hand or on the forehead. (v17)And no one could buy or sell anything without the mark, which was either the name of the beast or the number representing his name). Interesting thought, how just the makers of a world order can not only fabricate Jesus, but predict how they will take power in the next few thousand years exactly... Funny stuff that the bible predicted the day of Isreal's rebirth as a nation to the day (more on that in www.harvestreno.org/messages.asp in the God's Word "Precise to the Day", as i don't feel like talking thought the math and bible verses). I have a bit trouble believing that a group of human beings can do all that... Anyway I believe this whole thing is just a fulfillment of the bibles prophecy, and it will happen and is also deceiving people about Christ though, as also prophesied.This was such an eye opener in my Christian belief that I was sitting there the whole time saying, WOW- its all falling in to the predicted puzzle really quickly. Great preview of current figureheads running governments. I ENCOURAGE EVERYONE TO WATCH THIS, BUT Don't BELIEVE EVERYTHING.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film shows viewers not to believe anything they read, are shown, or told, and on the official website it says, "It is my hope that people will not take what is said in the film as the truth, but find out for themselves, for truth is not told, it is realised." Which is a true statement to make. For years people have believed only what they have been told to believe when they should be finding it out for themselves.Another quote i'd like to use is "there are 3 sides to every story. Yours, mine and the truth." (Extreme, from the album "III sides to every story" 1992) The Media has told their story of the world, and Zeitgeist does its best to tell the opposite side, I believe that neither is right, but by researching it further i'd like to realise what the truth is. (an improbable feat, i know.)I'd like to ask Juha what you mean when you say "we have more than we need on this planet" as i have heard that the population currently is using somewhere in the region of 1.5 times the amount of resources that are available, which makes sense to me if you think about one of the major rules of physics, "energy can not be created or destroyed, it can only be changed from one form to another." if the population is increasing constantly, where is all the extra energy coming from to support us all? I would suggest to everyone that reads this to watch Zeitgeist:The Movie and take everything with a pinch of salt, and to treat everything you watch as 'fact' like this from now on, get into discussions/debates with people about everything and anything, to broaden your view on life, and most of all, try to listen as much as you speak.(feel free to email me with any ideas, I'm always interested to hear others' views)Thanks, Frase</fullReview>

I can assure you you will definitely going to love this awesome movie.THIS MOVIE IS MEANT FOR YOUR BENEFIT.the motto of this documentary is to motivate you to know the truth and seek for truth.THIS MOVIE REVEALS ASTONISHING FACTS REGARDING OUR MISCONCEPTIONS Which ARE BUILD UP BY MEDIA, GOVERNMENT AND RELIGIOUS INSTITUTIONS. ALSO THE MOVIE TELLS US ABOUT THE CORRUPT PRACTICES OF FEDERAL RESERVE BANK.THE MORE YOU BEGIN TO INVESTIGATE THE MORE YOU FIND LIES.--- about he movie --- Part I: The Greatest Story Ever Told Part I evaluates the historicity of the Bible. In furtherance of the Jesus myth hypothesis, this part argues that the historical Jesus is a literary and astrological hybrid, and that the Bible is based on astrological principles documented by many ancient civilizations, especially pertaining to the movement of the sun through the sky and stars. This section is also used by the film to show the Pagan origins of the symbol of the Cross. According to the movie, religion and myths in general can be used to motivate people to be good or remember important astrological occurrences, but ultimately if the majority of people believe in something that is not true, then they are in danger of being controlled or oppressed.Part II: All the World's a Stage 9/11 attacks Part II of the documentary claims 9/11 was engineered to generate mass fear, justify going to war with Afghanistan and Iraq, to remove civil liberties from the general public, and to make more money for the people in power. These theories include that the United States was warned about the impending September 11, 2001 attacks, that NORAD allowed the planes to reach their targets, and that the World Trade Center buildings underwent a controlled demolition. The film also explores the theory that six of the named hijackers are still alive, that Hani Hanjour could not have flown Flight 77 into the Pentagon, that the Bush Administration covered up the truth in the 9/11 Commission Report, and that the mainstream media has failed to ask important questions about the official account.Part III: Don't Mind the Men Behind the Curtain The Federal Reserve In Part III, the film details the Theory of Electronic Conspiracy, explores war profiteering and describes the goal of bankers to be a world power over a controllable public.[7] This section also explores the possibility that there is a clandestine movement to usurp the American constitution and US dollar without the ratification of Congress. This currency union would gradually be merged into a One World government. The movie concludes that under such a government, every human being will be implanted with a RFID microchip which will be used to monitor individuals and suppress dissent. It also claims that the Internal Revenue Service and the U.S. Federal Income Tax are unconstitutional and there are no laws which state that citizens must pay the tax. The movie ends, however, expressing confidence in the possibility of overthrowing oppressive forces and the ultimate triumph of revolution.Instead of watching something junk watch this beautiful movie.</fullReview>

Means of subversion instead of election (The voting controversy when bush first become president). Means like Intimidation instead of free choice (the Amerro controversy, Iraq-Afghanistan crusades).This ruthless system combines of banks, military, diplomatic, economic &amp; political operations. Its preparations are concealed not published (9/11 events, Vietnam, Iraq war etc), mistakes are buried, no secrets revealed (video footage of pentagon strike, domino like fall of WTC building) and its opposers are silenced not confronted.Don't be focused on crafted news. The media is not as pure as it looks. They will only show you what they want you to see. And one day, you will find yourself enslaved by the govt which is actually run by few dominant financial giants.

Thereby controlling everything that you posses, everything that you have and everything that you ARE.Rise and Inform and Be Alert. Ask questions.

		<fullReview>Yes, if the filmmakers had put this tripe forward as a summer blockbuster they would have real pot boiler on their hands: paranoia, deadly conspiracies, pain and panic.But what we have instead is a series of retread anti-establishment slogans boiled down into a nice simmering stew of misplaced anger. To the makers of this film: reality is a lie but that's okay because we know the truth and that gives all the things that go wrong in the world their own inherent meaning.I've always found it funny that this film and Loose Change try to present their claims as an attempt to "ask the questions no one else does" then the directors get all upset when some one provides perfectly logical and reasonable evidence for why nobody bothered to ask such questions.The fresh air in this Indy Media atrocity is religion, where the "shocking" info is actually pretty old news to anyone who cracked a theology or archeology book in the past twenty years.The editing is good and it's slickly produced but when you really look at the film in context you begin to see it as either a sad grab at fame using other people's insecurities, an attempt to one day earn a little coin from a book tour, or a genuinely crazy diatribe urging a social revolution that isn't needed or welcomed by the general public.So many people have said this movie changed their lives but if that's true, I shudder to think how bad your life must have been before you saw this.If you have more then four IQ points, don't bother watching it.</fullReview>

When I say 'documentary', I note that it is completely and utterly in jest, because this movie watches like an uneducated tinfoil hatted person sat in their Faraday cage and thought up things based on face value without any research with their imaginary friend, both egging each other on to come up with more and more outrageous and non-sensical unsupported theories.There is more than enough information even on this page debunking the large majority of things presented in this is bizarre production so I won't go into them again, start with the 'goofs' page though, because honestly, the factual incorrectness of this appallingly fallacious film needs to be realised.And all that is said without commenting on the disgustingly average presentation style that is presented by this 'doco' - I have never watched anything with such little production value and when I say 'value', I don't mean it in terms of monetary value, I mean it in that whoever wrote this and filmed it had such disregard for the people they that would be so desperate to believe what it had to say that they got through the whole thing, they didn't even bother to edit it properly so it was watchable out of respect for the viewer. Effectively they had so little regard for anyone who stayed through this tripe the whole way as they felt they must be offering so little to society as to have time or inclination to watch this entire gascloud, it contains large periods of noise or flashing montages, with no artistic, informational or viewer value at all.Honestly, do not waste your time - go to a 9/11 website instead, it'll be heaps quicker, more entertaining and closer to anything factual you'll get in this abomination.

		<shortDescription>Zeitgeist: the Hipster Investigative Documentary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK, its a thought provoking well presented piece of propaganda. This can be said of any overly skewed documentary. It tells us precious little about the actual topic and volumes about the presenters. The views of the money producers must have greater impact then any opposing view; right or wrong. I get it; religion and government spread lies everywhere so you must educate yourself. Let's ask George Carlin, now that is funny but where are the other evidence; seriously people the sources mentioned in this film seem to quote from each other in circular fashion. How is this creditable, I kind of expected a cameo appearance by Giorgio Tsoukalos or David Icke. If you watch this documentary and accept all Zeitgeists facts at face value then you might adopt the strong belief that super intelligent aliens from outer space started our first civilizations.It's OK with me if you want to be anti-religious and frankly God likely does not care what any of us think. Your belief is yours to manage. Some people want to figure out the evil conspiracies that seem to plague our existence but your clear understanding of all this does not transform it into a truth. Indeed if you want to be trendy at parties, myth is a far better topic than truth because its so much more fun to speculate on conspiracies. I would have inserted a quote from Col. Nathan R. Jessup and ask him what he thinks about this subject; he would tell us that we don't really want to know the truth; deep down in places that we don't talk about at parties the fact is we can't handle the truth! How creditable is that? FYI Col. Nathan R. Jessup is a fictional character from a screenplay.Zeitgeist views are largely the result of too much utopian speculation, it simply must undermine conventional religions and social orders (God and Kings) to prepare us for the true future that we were meant to have. How sweet....This first part of these 3 episodes is probably the best part of the film because they use George Carlin to help us mix their palatable truths with their palatable fiction. We know for a fact that many ancient societies revered the Sun and nature and of course the Egyptians were the earliest known civilizations. However, the producers distort many of these truths in order to paint a picture that simply isn't true. I will give you just one example; about 12-13 mins into the film they claim that the background myth for God's Sun dying on the cross is recycled astrological material connecting patterns making the winter death of the Sun as it pauses for 3 days in the vicinity of the Crux. Death on the cross, wow what a curious breakthrough but the Crux is not in line with the northern view of the sun or any northern zodiacal constellation. The Sun passing near the Southern Cross is only fully viewed from the southern hemisphere and never from any Mediterranean countries as this movie seems to describe. Technically only one Crux star named Gamma Crucis can sometimes be seen at some northern latitudes. The ancient Greeks and Egyptians may have seen Gamma Crucis but not the other 4 southern stars that make the southern cross. Wiki will tell you that the Crux was first crudely documented in 1455 by navigator Alvise Cadamosto but historians generally credit Jo?o Faras and Pedro lvares Cabral for being the first Europeans to depict the Crux correctly. So how was this obviously part of ancient Mediterranean myths? Because Zeitgeist says so; but what does the Pope say, what does Giorgio Tsoukalos or David Icke say? F*ck it; lets skip all the conspiracies like 9/11 and the International Bankers, lets go back to the funny stuff like George Carlin; now that's real entertainment. Zeitgeist is mostly BAD investigations and not really a documentary. Yet they speak of a need for self education, inconceivable! I would rather be unemployed in Greenland. FYI the Ballarat Observatory, in Australia (Located 37 Degrees South) has a great view of the Crux, every night. Go and view it for an entire year and you will never see the Sun cross its path as depicted in this so called documentary.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a lesson in viral campaigning</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At the time when Zeitgeist hit the internet it's been recommended by several people around me. And since it's been available online for free, i decided to give it a try. From today's standpoint it is clear to me how viral campaigning can't work alone, i.e. posting your home video and expecting millions of viewers to share it. Traditional media must be involved at some point. Because of this lesson i gave Zeitgeist the second star.Concerning the contents, Zeitgeist fails already in the first of three segments. The story of Christianity and comparison to other older religions was interesting, yet my desktop research failed to identify or prove any of "evidence" presented. It is not whether you're a Christian or not, rather about using your mind.From then on the i regarded Zeitgeist as a video experiment, although on under-graduate level.The segment on 9-11 was just one of many conspiracy theories. Whether you believe the official version or not, in today's world it should be clear how any media report is skewed according to that particular media's needs. And even when it is the truth and nothing but the truth, some spin doctor might use it to support the bad guys. Therefore i don't see why i should believe Zeitgeist's version of events leading to and surrounding 9-11.The third segment asserted how history is manipulated to benefit the small group of greedy individuals. On the one hand, it should be clear that there would always be an elite profiting from any event in contemporary society. On the other hand i doubt it would be a group of Freemasons, Men in Black, Rothschilds or similar members of conspiracy theorists' menagerie controlling all events around the globe.Overall Zeitgeist puts forward some interesting ideas that are mixed with fabrications to such extent that it discredits itself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Began as Interesting Comparison Between Paganism and Christianity, Then Became Ultimate Conspiracy-Theory Propaganda</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At the beginning of the film, there is a comparison between Christianity, the life of Jesus as portrayed in the Gospels of the New Testament, and myths associated with paganism. No question, pagan ideas infiltrate much of what becomes "Christian mythology". Fair enough. However, then the discourse moves to the other far extreme of the spectrum, trying to claim Jesus was not an historical figure. Their reasoning? It's one big fallacious hoax concocted by first century forgeries. This is absolutely ridiculous, and this is coming from someone who believes the Gospels are an interplay between historical facts and mythology. While we don't have a lot of sources independent of the New Testament to corroborate the historicity of Jesus, most biblical scholars are confident we have enough to prove he did exist. (Whether or not he claimed to be the Son of God is another matter entirely.)The film falls into some of the rhetoric I've heard Evangelicals claim but in the other direction. They claim the writings of Josephus, a first-century historian who mentions Jesus, albeit only briefly, is a forgery. I have read many writings composed by the top biblical scholars over the years, including Bart Erhman, John Dominic Crossan, Elaine Pagels, and many others, and not a-one contests that Josephus is some kind of a hoax and/or forgery. While some of his details are certainly disputed by scholars on finer points, Josephus is generally regarded as a reliable primary source for events close to his own time, particularly those in the first century.The film then goes onto claim that the 9/11 attacks, similar to the conspiracy of the historicity of Jesus, is also a giant conspiracy hoax. The filmmakers claim the attacks were engaged not by Al-Qaeda led by Bin Laden but by a secret world order/government in order to perpetuate the war on terror. While I do believe there are many unanswered questions in terms of how the Bush Administration handled the attacks, and even questions which might indicate some people in intelligence knew something was going to happen, there is not enough evidence to demonstrate that in fact the Bush Administration was acting as some pawn for a secret world government. I do believe the Bush Administration acted recklessly in its deployment of troops in the Middle East, particularly in Iraq.A film which takes conspiracy theories to the extreme. Because of the lopsided rhetoric, many will dismiss the film outright and may be reluctant to understand issues raised about 9/11 which should be explored. While I am not adverse to the idea of some conspiracies (I believe there was a Lincoln conspiracy but not a JFK one) I believe the film fails to adequately address the questions. It falls into the same trap as other documentaries which favor completely exonerating the Bush Administration of any wrong-doing. This is just far left-wing propaganda pure and simple.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A movie made by a guy who doesn't understand economics</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I will give the documentary credit for arguing a few good points. However, their suggestion for a resource based economy is a result of not understanding how economics works. The filmmaker Peter Joseph blames an entire economic system for a few things that have happened through capitalism. Banks are blamed for the recent economic problems in the United States and the rest of the world, but Joseph gets the impression that that is capitalism as a whole. Just because a corporation or a bank does something wrong, does not mean you blame the entire system. The film advocates for giving away all resources for free, yet contradicts itself by saying you're not allowed to own anything, but just for a limited amount of time. They think their system will bring a utopia, but don't bother to put it into practice by looking at some scenarios. If you live in a village where everything is free, and 60 people want beef for their food, but there is only enough to give to 40 at the time, how do you decide who gets it and who doesn't? Since Joseph doesn't understand that we have supply and demand, thus we have money, he thinks we should just give away things for free. The film is essentially calling for socialism and communism, while defending itself by saying it's suggesting something else. Joseph implies that money is just a big game for the world that only benefits a few and leaves everybody else on the bottom. They tend to look at problems around the world such as poverty, disease, and war and jump to conclusions and say that the current system meant for that to happen. Without doing research on what caused these things, the documentary is more of an opinion documentary than a factual one. So instead, they suggest conspiracy theories, and a system that doesn't work. The film implies that everybody is a slave, which is an obvious result of arguing from ignorance. Yes, there are people in poverty. That is why people give to charity. That is why the government gives handouts. If the system meant for people to be enslaved, they wouldn't be helping poor people. The attitude of the filmmaker is an "I'm right, you're wrong" attitude to all the viewers who strongly disagree with the ideas suggested in this film. The filmmaker does ask reasonable questions, but the entire film is made up of jumping to conclusions based on opinion rather than thorough research on the cause and effect of the problems it tells about. Joseph would rather believe that all the problems in the world are the source of one single plan controlling everything, rather than the fact that the world is filled with randomness, chaos, and complicated issues from multiple sources. Don't bother watching this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You'll watch Zeitgeist and be like..."oh wow man! dang it, I knew all this stuff was connected" and you'll be all amped and ready to go research these "facts" the film so professionally presents. Problem is...after you research these "facts" you'll find they're pretty much all wrong...and I mean like all of them. The truth is nudged ever so slightly in fractions to align a train of thought that the conspiracy is very real and you're slipping if you don't "wake up!!!!" Sigh. Fact check people. The dates are wrong, the religions are wrong, the players are wrong and the people behind this movement are associated with anti-Semites.

		<shortDescription>Entertaining Fiction?yes, "documentary"?no</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie was a relatively entertaining mishmash of authoritative sounding conspiracy theories. Think of a Ken Burns effort, if Ken Burns mixed in some faster editing and were prone to schizophrenic streams of consciousness. To start with, the intro sequence was far too long. I almost didn't watch what followed because I thought the whole thing would be more of the same. It was like watching the movie Malcolm McDowell was forced to view in Clockwork Orange while strapped to a chair, his eyes held open by weird medical devices. Eventually the "documentary" began, and launched into a forced, contrived attempt to "prove" every major religion was a point by point adoption of particular Egyptian mythology. No doubt religions have, in deed, picked up and adapted bits from the oldest of myths. It's also a reasonable certainty the early Roman Church adopted dates of pagan religious holidays based on seasonal earthly events to make conversion more palatable to the those assimilated through missionary or force. That doesn't overcome the factual errors and sweeping omissions that make the argument over-simplistic and just plain inaccurate. Postulation on the origins of world religion (Part I) had little to do with Parts II and III, except for the general idea that governments and those pulling secret strings use propaganda to manipulate the masses.Parts II and III turned out to be the same kind of convoluted conspiracy theories you can find on any number of crackpot blogs consumed with the idea of secret conspirators behind a nefarious, shadowy new world order. If you've ever seen Glenn Beck work that crazy chalk board of his, you'll recognize the format of this "documentary." Take great numbers of facts spanning centuries, add sweeping conjecture, a pinch of quotation from disjunct sources, stir in a little six degrees from Kevin Bacon, plus a dash of paranoia. What you get is a recipe for a fairly entertaining brew of mishegoss and wing-nuttery. It's sure to appeal to that bit of closeted conspiracy theorists in all of us, but it's a little like an amusement park ride. It's fun to imagine it's real while on that ride, but when you get off you still know it was smoke and mirrors the whole time. Ironically, the final conclusion borrows the real message of the major world religions the makers of the movie conveniently left out in part I, that generally being brotherly love and generosity of spirit conquers the worldly evil of greed and hunger for power. If you buy into the entirety of this giant mural painted with huuuuge sweeping strokes, you should probably get on the series of tubes that is the dot com, fire up the google machine, and do a search for "famous PT Barnum quote."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There is a lot of shocking truth revealed in this movie but also a lot of nonsense and disinformation. When I first watched it I was quite inspired by the proposed solutions such as doing away with central banks and getting rid of money. With the benefit of time and further learning I am now deeply suspicious of this movie. The idea that we need our resources and cities and everything planned centrally by 'technocrats' and 'science' sounds like another way of describing the global dictatorship that is planned for our near future, the New World Order. As a species we are at a turning point in our history. We need to wake up and wake up quickly. I like the solutions proposed in 'Thrive' much more than whats on offer here.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Much of this movie is conspiratorial and over the top, but if nothing else it helps us to understand and reminds us that governments are not benign institutions simply looking out for the welfare of its citizens. Governments and those in power from all human history have used any and all tools at their disposal to influence and manipulate their citizenry and modern governments, including the US government, are no exception. The most powerful tools a governments can use include religion, fear, and debt, which are the focus of this documentary. It is often difficult for the average citizen of any country to see this in their own government, especially one as finely tuned and all powerful as the US government, and this film does just that.

		<shortDescription>$ vs. Free-thinkers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The problem with this movie and others like it is that it tries too hard. It takes simple truths and blends them with exaggeration and conspiracy theory to create a blurry image that just polarizes people. I choose to score it in the middle because while not really a great or eye-opening film it in nonetheless thought-provoking. I find it unfortunate that anyone I've ever talked to about this either takes it too far to heart or dismisses it as ridiculous. The second part is mostly to blame for this as 1) 9/11 remains a touchy subject and 2) even if you believe that we were partially involved with the attacks (which is very likely), there is stuff in there that is simply not true. To me, the good thing about this movie is it makes clear what I think should be obvious to anyone with a modicum of basic intelligence and independent thought. Of course all religions are based off the same pagan concepts of how our ancestors tried to understand the world. And of course these religions were perverted and used to control people, build empires, start wars, maintain the status quo and make money. Just as the reason for U.S. involvement of war is to make money. I mean really. War is big business. The few people who control most of the money control the world. These are not novel concepts. And then just when you think the film has redeemed itself with a nice history lesson it goes off on computer implants and world government. There is no great conspiracy. Money is worthless crap and land should not be owned but shared. But we're never gonna go back that far to that way things were. It would require way too many people to completely give up everything they've known and grown accustomed to. Yes the film doesn't offer any suggestions or solutions. So just who is this movie made for?? Seems like the basic message is the classic don't blindly believe everything you're told. Yet it's presented in a way which wants you to just swallow everything it has to say as fact. This seems to inherently detract from its basic message, while failing to win any converts from the other side.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>manipulation (exercise I - III)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After the first vision, i thought by myself: wow, if this would be really true, i would have been really blind. This movie understands it very well to catch you. There are three chapters: I) The astrological origin of faith, from the Egyptian mythology to Christianity. II) How the American government manipulated/terrorized the people to have the majority behind their intentions (war), from WWI to War on Terrorism. III) or IIb) The financial industry, ruler of the world: the role of the FED and the abuse of mass media. For all that, quite entertaining. BUT this "documentary" is manipulating. I have to admit, my first reflex was to give this movie 10/10. Then, after researching about chapter I, i must see that a lot of "facts" could not be proved, but presented if they were it. This kind of mistake can cost you your reputation, unfortunately ;-) It is not scientific, what i demand from a source who claims to know it better. Conclusion: Nevertheless the film touches a "felt truth" in some important points, what let you think a bit more at least. For me it is a dignified reflexion of today's zeitgeist.</fullReview>

Usually, it gets boring when you start explaining something too deeply and would lose much of the audience by proving every fact you tell. But it gives you another view of the all thing. It makes you think maybe all we are told on TV, on the News and on newspaper is not always true, it's just what they want us to think is true. And more important, after looking at different sources of information, this movie explains some points better than religion or media (about 9/11) ever told. Maybe some points about the religion are not true, but seriously, when have any religion proved to be right? Someone resurrecting in the first place? Walking on water? How do you comment something that is build on human stories on the first place? And about the 9/11? I got more information in this movie than I had from the media. Yet we should still doubt, but this movie made me seriously doubt about the "official version". You should also watch the second one, it gets better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Zeitgeist: The best "demockery" documentary yet, but......</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like all sources of information that expose ugly truths, after depressing the viewer with the knowledge of these awful realities, this film offers no viable means of action toward remedying our terrible predicament. How can mass knowledge of just how bad things really are, then greater mass anxiety, an increasingly insular society and increased mass ulcers benefit us? Wouldn't it be better not to know of a terrible impending reality, if there's absolutely nothing we can do about it?Zeitgeist does a fine job of exposing many of the lies that are integral parts of our lives, great lies which were skillfully created and orchestrated by the greatest propaganda machines money could buy, which were owned by the same tiny, elite minority who now own the vast majority of everything of value on Earth. But never satisfied, (as crazy as it sounds) these sociopaths (CFR, et al) seriously intend to own and control literally everything and everyone.I hope the sequel offers us a course of action against these predators which is more viable than writing to "their" legislators. It should also expose their so-far successful, multi-generational plan to continue to dis-empower and impoverish us and increase our ambient fear, disgust and paranoia until the whole world cries out for a one world government that promises world peace..... which will, of course, be wholly owned and operated by that same happy group of monsters who brought us all our wars, racism, wealth gap, dumbing down, the IRS, the fed, recessions, depressions and historic proportions of political corruption and pollution. Accepting Zeitgeist's ugly truths does paint a bleak, "Soilent Green" future-image of a desolate, enslaved Earth. And, their plan has succeeded, so far. So, its ultimate success IS totally inevitable, unless We unite our awesome will against them through our own system of actual democracy (before they outlaw that, too). Demockery will never benefit anyone but its rulers. And, democracy is its only cure. So, let's begin to reverse their competitive paradigm into the true spirit of cooperation that real democracy will require. If not for Us, let's do this, the right thing, to ensure the survival and prosperity of posterity!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The redefining of horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There have been extensive talks about the 9/11 as this is the mass-appealing event closest to our times. The most blatant one of the 21st century.When I first heard about this documentary I assumed that it was yet another discussion of the staging of 9/11. A thorough one though, given its recognition.However, Peter Jackson's work is so much more. I urge you to watch this film. WATCH THE ZEITGEIST. This phenomenal eye-opening and jaw-dropping piece of research will place you in an intimidating and ultimately scary world. There is one positive side to this though: it is the REAL world.Its say on religion is well backed up, articulate and succinct. It doesn't try to win you over with the mere affirmation that religion causes pain and suffering. Instead, Peter Jackson's raw view integrated the concept of religion into the all-reaching zeitgeist that is put in front of our eyes.The facts presented on 9/11 are set on irrefutable evidence. and its conclusion is both shocking and blatant. Most of all, however, it is terrifying.I must come to terms with myself and admit that some of the arguments end up being far-fetched. Nevertheless, the premises supporting these arguments are worryingly solid and logical. Most importantly, they are based on facts.I am a graduate in Economics so that I tend to analyse theories through their practical and logical holes. There are not many in this movie. The arguments made lay some information on us that scares us. At some points in the movie I felt terrified of the environment surrounding me. This movie redefines horror. It is real, it makes sense. It scares the sh*t out of us. But this is why we must watch it.There is something terribly wrong with the world. Peter Jackson is only trying to show you what it is.</fullReview>

The producer Peter Joseph states "It is my hope that people will not take what is said in the film as the truth, but find out for themselves, for truth is not told, it is realized".In "The Matrix", Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) tells Neo "This is your last chance. After this, there is no turning back. You take the blue pill - the story ends, you wake up in your bed and believe whatever you want to believe. You take the red pill - you stay in Wonderland and I show you how deep the rabbit-hole goes." Well, in our real world, "Zeitgeist" is the red pill.

They took part in every single political episode in our country since the 60's. Education has been neglected since always, so we still have a huge number of illiterate people in our country and another big group called "functional illiterates" who are able to read and write and live in society, but follow orders as robots.But since broadband internet has become cheaper and accessible for more people, social networks have become a way to promote debate and share information that once was hidden and manipulated by media according to their agenda. People are becoming more aware of their political participation and riots and protests are slowly becoming routine here.We are all brothers and sisters in this planet, put against each other by our official leaders and media since always.

That's what the first part about this movie is: a fraudulent representation of history's most controversial character.To give you an idea about the misrepresentation: one of the so-called sources of Christianity is a messianic person who literally is born every day and dies every day; and this movie claims that they share the same birthday as Jesus. There are many other examples I could have used, but that right there should tell you: the entire religious part of this movie should be ignored.The remaining parts: the Federal Reserve system and it's corruption I found fascinating because that topic is very complex and I've always wondered how closely tied our Country's banking system was to the health of the world... I'll be watching that segment over and over and if the author wasn't such an Anti-Christ it would do much much better.Look: even if you are anti-Christ that doesn't automatically get bad hits from me... it's flat out misrepresentation that clouds the journalistic credibility of a project and just don't go there.

As usual though when it talks about religion it becomes much less factual and much more personal. The data about religions it talks about is not only inaccurate but preposterous.

		<fullReview>'Zeitgeist' is certainly reminiscent of conspiracy documentaries that have become popular in recent years, mostly due to their free distribution over the internet. However, the most obvious problem with films of this type is that they almost always find themselves preaching to the converted.The key points in 'Zeitgeist' are interesting, and the film's analysis of the US and Global financial systems is well worth watching. The film's comment on religion and politics is also interesting, but it all descends - perhaps inevitably - into standard conspiracy, ultra-radical and nonsensical suggestions about how to improve our global community. The film leads up to a final sequence which looks like a cult recruitment tape.Unfortunately, once you peel back the initial layer of the financial and religious expos, you are left with something little more advanced than a marijuana-inspired 'put the world to rights' session. The film's 'revolutionary' suggestion that we create a Utopian money-free society is about as realistic as telling us all to go and live under the sea.If we really want to make the world a better place, we're going to have to look more at adapting what we have rather than throwing everything away and starting again, as is the conclusion of the film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched about 3/4 of it tonight before I had to turn it off. There are some things that are true but I found the presentation to be just as manipulative as the actions of the "elites' they were admonishing. I asked myself more than once, "what if they inserted the word Jew every time they said banker?" Yes, some things they said are true, but many facts are dubious and strung together out of context while excluding others that might inconveniently contradict or cast doubt on their message. I have never been a fan of conspiracy theories, although I will readily admit some that I've come across are dead on. If what this movie says is correct, we're all f**ked. I won't dispute many of their assertions because they are probably right, however, the methods employed in compiling the narrative and images were very reminiscent of other propaganda films I have seen. That makes their message seem contrived and false, whether or not it actually is. One thing I noticed is their choice of villains and heroes. They didn't mention that Charles Lindberg was an alleged Nazi sympathizer but they accuse FDR of starting American involvement in WWII because his family was in banking. It almost seems like the argument you might find in some mid-west militia-man handbook. The pace of the images was fast enough to suspend rational processing of what they were saying, eventually I didn't think I could keep watching without either being brainwashed in some way or just blowing it off. Contrived and manipulative, yes. Wrong? I can't say, but I hope it is. Just because you're paranoid doesn't mean that they're not out to get you. The producers shouldn't try and convince audience members that they are being secretly enslaved by presenting unsubstantiated and misleading information in rapid fire sequences presented without context. I liked the first part.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An excellent underground documentary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What I find amazing about this film, is that the Author (Who uses a bible reference for his name) never tries to convince you of anything; he only lays out some facts, expounds on them, and then allows you to decide what you want.Part-1 of the film deals with the bible, both the old and new testaments. Part-2 of the Film deals with recent problems throughout the United States (primarily), and possible cause &amp; effect scenarios. Part-3 of the Film primarily deals with our use of money, how it's controlled, and the implications of a society that has gone astray.This film is guaranteed to open your eyes, like no film before, and likely after. It will tell you things you never knew, and dispel certain "facts" as myth. When you are finished watching this documentary, you will immediately want to discuss it with the person next to you. Which is the purpose of the film.The Author/Writer/Producer,etc does not wish to convince you of seeing anything the way he may see things, as he doesn't show perspectives... only documented facts. He does want you to think. And his documentary accomplishes that.</fullReview>

The only merit this film has is as a study of the art of emotional manipulation. Rarely has such a compelling presentation contained so little of objective merit.You know what they say: always keep an open mind. Just not so open that your brains fall out. If they do, this is pretty much how the world will look to you.For trivia fans the animations, done by director Peter Joseph (Mercola)'s brother Eric, will offer a foretaste of the techniques he later uses in his own conspiracist whacknut fantasy, Burzynski: Cancer Is Serious Business.

		<fullReview>Watched this movie randomly, because it was on Netflix. For those who simply wish to hate religion they will emotionally enjoy it. I at first found it very interesting but as I started to fact check i was disappointed. Simple fact checks make it clear that almost every statement in this movie is at least an exaggeration and sometimes completely inaccurate. It is very biased and tries to sway people by listing false "facts" so quickly that people are swept away. Many things that actually support Christianity are twisted in such a way to sound alternative to it. I'm sick of both sides of every debate being un-factual and making so many emotional ploys. Liberal, conservative, Christian, atheists, there is no excuse to be un-factual. Unfortunately this movie is propaganda, and has to be thrown out.I wish I could believe some of it, but can't fact check all of it and what I could fact check was wrong the majority of the time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's a shame such "documentaries" exist really. Documentaries are a great way to explore the world around us, without leaving the comfort of our chair. They can inspire thought and feelings. Even biased ones are generally structured around a good/interesting idea. What we have here is conspiracy toss. It starts by undermining all religion. Not that I'm against that, but it does it with complete lies. Sure, some of the astrological ideas are interesting, but even I know there aren't THAT many similarities between so many cultures/beliefs. This all seems to be a set up for then trying to convince us that 9/11 was an inside job. Again, this is interesting, but it ONLY presents arguments for its case. How about being objective? It also twists the use of the incredible film, Network. After Finch's rant about life having value, it cuts to a man falling from the WTC. The makers of this documentary are doing exactly what they criticize the government of doing. Creating lies and paranoia in order to create fear and control. Some interesting ideas, but should be watched as fiction.</fullReview>

So what problem are the creator's of the movie having with commandments or faith in God?"The above is the most ridiculuos thing I've heard in years. For one people know 'not to kill' without the 10 commandments telling them so and two christians have killed in the name of their god for years (e.g. the Crusades). Just because someone wears a collar and believes in god does not make them a good person. Just look at the abuse of children the religious orders of ireland carried out in the 50 and 60s ... maybe if one of the commandments was 'thou shall not abuse children' then they wouldn't have done it because it was a commandment. then</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretentious lies feeding an annoying and false "Know it all" culture</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was the biggest piece of opinionated rubbish I have ever seen. Since this was a free download I decided to give it go. It starts off with what presumably is DEEPLY meaningful images of war, the earth in a cage, 9/11 etc. I think this was meant to affect the audience somehow, but just came across as pretentious and meaningless, but I'm sure many fellow reviewers praising this film could really relate their internet connected, privileged, Western lives with the image of a caged world.Part 1: This section is more or less atheist porn for teenagers and adolescents whose opinions are always right. In a nutshell, Jesus is not a historical person as mainstream scholars accept, but a fictional character created off of a template of the constellations, foreign mythologies and worship of the sun by a bunch of Hebrew peasants anticipating THE ENTIRE FUTURE OF THE HUMAN RACE. As an agnostic, I may have remained interested in any of this if not for the HUNDREDS of lies and mistakes made throughout. I know Greek mythology as I'm sure many other people know Egyptian, Hindu, Turkish and any other one mentioned in the film. Dionysus was not born of a virgin, (Zeus had an affair with his mother) he was not crucified and resurrected (He was a God) and was born on the 25th of December (Roman calender we know today came well over a Millennium after Dionysus) Many other reviewers have pointed out fellow flaws in other religions, but since I don't have a million years and know the Greek better I won't go into them. Another flaw is basing the whole. "Jesus's birth on the 25th December was based on the stars" We don't know Jesus' real birthday, it was purely based on the Roman winter festival. As usual basic facts are covered up to "enhance" and "enlighten" the audience who I'm sure will gloat about their new "knowledge". Overall part one was awful and probably tilted me more towards theism from purely agnostic.Part 2: Probably the most "controversial" of the topics was the subject of 9/11 being a government conspiracy and that the entire engineering explanation from world wide experts is wrong. The evidence? Ummm...more lies, half pieced conspiracies and opinions. Unlike the first part, I didn't have that much background knowledge, but judging from the lies of part one, the facts other reviewers have stated and the entire scientific community I think we can tell this is more deceit. Also in light of the fact Osama Bin Laden has been killed, where in this he was in on the whole conspiracy, is just another bullet in the chest, who knows maybe he was George Bush's cloned twin? Part 3: You could tell this was really what the makers of the film were getting at. The insulting and snobbish tone of the previous parts was replaced with an openly hostile one, basically calling us brainwashed monkeys. The focus of this part is that the whole monetary system is controlled and pulled by invisible events as shown throughout history. Don't get me wrong, I prefer socialism and believe that yes, maybe we could change a few things financially. But this was literally a pure conspiracy strip club. Hinting at the illuminati and backing it up with half truths and lies. I know George Bush had issues, but his grandfather was in with the Nazis and helped cause World War 2? Is this a documentary or a graphic novel?Overall I do not recommend this film. It is based on deceit, lies and general trash. It has an aggressive, sneering tone getting across its "points" and ultimately just feeds the whole "I know and feel the pain of the truth" culture, which is based on...a lie.</fullReview>

If you believe the government is hiding aliens, and conspiring in any number of other ways, then you will love it and find much to cling to.As for Part 1 I would recommend you instead watch The God Who Wasn't There. It covers the same ground much more thoroughly without the tackiness of this presentation. There are many better quality sources of information covering this area -both of the real kind and of the entertainment kind.As for Parts 2 and 3, if you make up your own conspiracies you'll be just as wise.That so many people rate this film so highly is a testament to credulity of people, and a shame for the well respected rating system of IMDb, because it in no way belongs among the great films that share those high ratings.</fullReview>

Seeding panic within less educated people, and getting some members for their sect (Yes, there is a movement called the "ZEITGEIST MOVEMENT") was probably the only intention of this Dan Brown-ish piece of "art".

The portion on religion is unspeakably fallacious; I'm enraged at how many people this movie has deceived. Its facts are all wrong, its ideas are old and disproved, but as long as conspiracy theorists are around, there will be plenty of people gullible enough to buy into this kind of propaganda. 9/11 myths have been practically destroyed, the religious sections reek of ignorance (willful). I am disheartened at how many people post here praising this movie, all too ready to agree with its controversial "cool" ideas. No decent professor, journalist, or even educated person would find this movie "enlightening" or "awakening". It's made nicely, but the sheer dishonesty it employs is sickening. Look up the issues brought up by the movie -- you'll find yourself a little more aware. I can commend its creators for making a creative and apparently compelling film, but please, don't LIE. It's what makes the world all the more confused, and if you're about the truth in things, Zeitgeist is not the place to look.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More propaganda in this film than the institutions it attacks</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you want to attack propaganda, you might want to go about doing so by presenting as many facts to the viewer as possible and then let them come to their own conclusions. This film basically comes up with controversial, gimmicky conclusions about religion and the monetary system and then tries to convince the viewer that the filmmakers' viewpoint is the true "religion" and that they should follow it blindly.The film plays on people's lack of knowledge by providing a subset of well researched findings, combined with flashy editing and an authoritative tone. I think it preys on those who are not educated or not experienced in performing their own systematic research.I gave this film 5 stars because it had some interesting statistics and footage. Some of the presented research about religion was very "enlightening", although false in some places and definitely incomplete. I can't give it any more than 5 stars out of 10 because I hate the "smoke and mirrors" effects that surrounded it. Look under the "goofs" section for factual errors about the data that the filmmakers manipulated. At the end of the day, it takes a good propagandist to spot one and that's exactly what these filmmakers (Peter Joseph &amp; co?) are.The conclusions that the filmmakers come to are too simplistic, even moreso than those that mainstream institutions try to sell to us via their own marketing and propaganda. In the end, I think the film would only perpetuate those myths by highlighting them and discouraging critical thinking by providing us prepackaged conclusions. In short, I think the film "dumbs down the audience" by discouraging true critical inquiry and that the film is mediocre at best.</fullReview>

Especially as the very first segment. Big mistake in my opinion. I'm sure plenty of people were compelled to quit viewing the film and try to argue it with known or believed facts. If the author of this film wanted to cover theology as being total BS, then he should've directed the viewer to rent Bill Maher's 'Religulous'. With that aside, I thought it was a beautiful and informative documentary. Call them conspiracy theories if you will but understand that almost ALL of the other topics in the film CAN be cited and sourced if you take the time to do so for yourself. With that said, the thing I didn't like about the film were the frequent periods of black screens with only dialogue. It just needed SOMETHING for us to look at while we are listening.

		<fullReview>Why would some people even consider this as a documentary? People who believe in this had "known" all of it already; this fabrication only shows the shallow evidence what this kind of belief is constructed of. This does not however mean that everything in Zeitgeist is untrue, some notions are absolutely correct, but what is untrue is just about every conclusion that is made in Zeitgeist.The movie consists of three separate parts, first is about the myths of Christianity shown in the light of other ancient religions. Unfortunately this account, although well conceived, is full of mistakes and deliberate falsifications too. Zodiac is for today sheer mumbojumbo, but for ancients it was science as much as the astronomy of that day. Even Roman "scientists" like Varro believed in it. Biggest mistake is however the denial of Jesus as a historical person. There was no chance that any Roman or Greek historian could mention about some son of a Palestine Carpenter until he became famous; furthermore most of the historians mentioned in the context have no extant works left. Also the few historians whose work is extant mention him as a Jewish sect leader whom their followers call "Chrestus", meaning "ointed to be the King of Israel".The second part is about the usual conspiration theory about 911, trying to prove how the government attacked itself in order to gain people's sympathies for the war against Iraq and Afghanistan. The movie tries to prove how there were no terrorists on board of any planes, being able to use only one case where the suspect was mistakenly named. What's best is that the creator first says that Osama was not the author of the attacks, but still it is noteworthy to show Bush's relations with the guy from the time Osama was still enjoying the luxuries of the life in West.The third part is created to show how the now nearly bankrupt corporations wanted WW1, WW2 and Vietnam only to make more money with Americans' and others blood. With almost no knowledge on the economics the movie tells that taxation is slavery, but fails to realize that the corps also have to pay various taxes in many forms, and are subject even to change into partial state ownership for example in times of crisis. The end of Zeitgeist tells people to make a revolution and namedrops the usual extra Jesuses like Lennon, Gandhi and Martin Luther King, who all opposed this kind of incitation to violent revolution. Because this item seems to be relatively popular among all uneasy people in the West, it well deserves to be called the modern version of the Protocols of the Elders of Zion.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although there are probably fatal flaws in the creation of this romp, it is still a highly intellectual feast of intrigue. I cant find a way to disprove it, I'm not going to lie, I believe we are all ignorant to most things. As soon as a door closes and you are excluded from a conversation you can be classed as ignorant to whatever they are saying. Think about it... how many major officials plan things behind closed doors!!??? However, interestingly with Zeitgeist, everything that is said is backed up and backed up and backed up some more. More importantly however, particularly the second and third parts, IT IS FACT. You cant lie about this, the science behind it, the fact that it's America. The evidence withheld and the treatment of people (guilty people) involved who spent time with the American higher powers 24 hours before it happened... Is it so hard to open your mind slightly to believe it. You could say the same to me and ask me to open my mind to the possibility that it is not true, that it is all B.S. My back up for what i have said is simply this... too many people go about their lives fulfilling the saying "ignorance is bliss". They don't want to know, because something on TV or the pub is far more interesting. An abundance of people don't care, in fact the vast majorities don't care. They don't want to consider the possibility that the world is actually a violent, decadent, Crap pit. It cant be true can it? Surely these people that gave us all of this entertainment and fun in life and holidays, and tax free allowances and free medical care (well We get that, Americans are screwed in terms of medical care). However, the point is fear holds you prisoner. The possibility of one world power and the government tactfully planning for 60 years is too frightening to believe, so therefor it cant possibly be true!!! The threats that are thrown the general publics way throw us off. Just take a minute right now... consider everything you saw in the film and just acknowledge the chance that it is true. That actually there is a larger agenda... look at the call from Rockerfeller. He actually states 1 year before 9/11 exactly what has been happening for the past 7 years. All i can say to the cynical reviews is consider this... either its all the biggest misunderstanding of all time or the creator and director of the zeitgeist movie is in fact an alias to G w B., and that man in power in America is in fact throwing more fear and distraction our way, so he can continue his onslaught and manipulation that follows in the footsteps of his father and grandfather.The facts are all there guys, scientific and true. I think if lecturers and scholars in America can believe it is true then there has to be something there!!!I agree with who ever it was that said, to the cynical guy who obviously believes nothing and appears narrow minded, to disprove it... The creators got a lot of facts together to create there side of the argument. All you need to do, is disprove it. You could call it 'Peitpeist' by the CynicChaox</fullReview>

This was only 1/3 of the overall content.While I welcome his comments and it provokes further thoughts on the basis of Christianity being ancient Egyptian mythology, there is much more to this film than simply the religious section.Stating that Horus was born on 365 days of the year, as opposed to Zeitgeist's focus on his birth on just 1 of these days of the year does not refute the remainder of the film.It does not address the assertion that demolition experts are saying that they could not have done a better job of knocking down WTC buildings. Ancient Egyptian 'spells' vs Christian teachings, does not refute many of the remains of the WTC buildings possessing hallmarks of demolition work...It does not address the evidence provided of 'false-flag' operations in America's involvement in previous major wars. It does not address the evidence found for England's similar operations, and for that matter all other involved countries similar stories. Yet another example of governments seeing what they want to see for political/financial etc. reasons is raised in documentaries like "Storyline Australia - Truth, Lies and Intelligence" which show that irrespective of the wealth of evidence that the war was without foundation, the war machine was in motion and there were vested interests politically and financially in these conflicts progressing.As with any internet/film/media works, take this with a grain of salt as everyone else has suggested. Do not take this as the authoritative truth. Use it as a basis for your own research.A great film, and as it was intended, THOUGHT PROVOKING.~Bill Hicks was the king~</fullReview>

If the facts are valid and interesting, I'll watch without the music. A dramatic music background in a factual film has one purpose: to play on our emotions. It's a form of brainwashing. I suspect that I would appreciate learning the information presented in the film, but I don't like being brainwashed. The information should be able to stand on its own. So does the film have good information? Unless someone can tell me how to silence the damned background music, I'll never know. Loose Change 9/11 is another movie that uses this same kind of background music. I actually watched that movie all the way through, but I was cursing at the background music the entire time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nonsense: the Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was introduced to this movie with the description of it being eye opening and truthful. Far from it. I found this horribly difficult to watch. It is poorly edited, and some of the animations are quite frankly extremely annoying and amateur. I was extremely disgusted by this film. This film is an embarrassment, riddled with factual inaccuracies, poor arguments, and support for far fetched conspiracy theories that give the film an extremely propagandized feel. Rather than uncovering the truth, this film covers the truth with a fantasy of its own. I have one word for the people who rated this film so highly: Occam's Razor. For those that wish to see a more coherent and well supported examination of 9/11 and the American government, please look up the BBC documentary "The Power of Nightmares", and throw this unethical, deceitful, unreasonable agitprop trash in the dump where it belongs.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While I found this documentary thought-provoking and interesting to watch I was disappointed to find it has now been completely debunked. Its presentation of assertion as fact makes its authors comparable with the perpetrators of untruths it claims to be fighting against. Ironically it is the film itself, with its glaring inaccuracies, that should serve to warn us that we should not believe everything we are told. So let me quote it, "television is not the truth television is a goddamn amusement park."

		<shortDescription>Total rubbish. Are people really this gullible.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I will be getting a reputation for being someone who only gives negative reviews at this rate. However, this movie stinks big time. The only reason it gets a 2 instead of a 1 is because you can download it for free so you are not being ripped off financially, just intellectually.Part 1 tries to draw parallels between the Jesus myth and other mythologies. Unfortunately it picks one that does not remotely correlate and that is to Horus of the Egyptian pantheon. If you have studied Egyptian mythology there are absolutely NO parallels to be drawn between Horus and Jesus other than that, in English at least, their names contain 5 letters and the last two are us. That is about the only parallel that I could come up with. Now, there is no doubt in my mind that Christianity is a made up religion, but then they all are. I am even fairly sure that there is no firm evidence that someone called Jesus Christ ever existed at all. But the religious parallels between him and other religions just do not exist en masse as this movie implies. Do some research folks.Part 2 and 9/11 is bunkum of the first order. I have no doubt that incompetence was rife, but to stretch that to the US government making plans to kill 3-4000 people on it's own soil is absurd. There are many other ways they could have started the war on terror without resorting to something as insane as knocking down the center of New York. A conspiracy such as that could never have been kept secret. This movie underestimates the guilt factor that this would have generated. Somebody would have talked. That Bush and his cronies made full use of this to create a profitable war is indisputable. But that is not to say that they created the situation, that is a stretch of the imagination. All the so called scientific or engineering evidence given is simply nonsense and has been shown to be nonsense. Just because Bush was an arse, does not make him a murderer of his own people.Part 3. More of the same. Just because you don't like the Rockefellers, Rothschilds, et al, does not mean that they are conspiring to control the world. They are rich enough already.</fullReview>

This guy just makes crap up. Even if all of these other stories were true, Christ was not born on December 25 and he was not "crucified" on a cross. There is no mention of the date that Jesus was born, but it did say that the shepherds were outside at night tending to there flock. Not in December, it would have been to cold. But the 25th was a sun god celebration. Way to go emperor Constantine for that one. And cross is just a wrong translation. They just did not do that. They simply used a single post to nail people to. So there goes the December 25 and cross thing. Ugh! So if he got so much of this wrong/ made it up. How could I even take the rest of it seriously?</fullReview>

Just for starters, all of the stuff said about Horus has been proved false by Egyptologists, except for the light vs dark part. And all of the stuff about the stars lining up is a gross misrepresentation of how the constellations are really set up. I could point out everything that is wrong with this movie, but that would take far too long. Seriously people, don't just believe everything you hear.

		<shortDescription>will help one think about the truth of our government and religion, whatever that truth may be</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>DIRECTOR, Peter JosephI have never thought that intolerance or extremism of any kind to be healthy. This documentary film is without a doubt aimed at the far right conservatives and to promote libertarian causes.I do believe that whatever a person's beliefs, one should have an open mind. For example, if a Christian knows about the beliefs of Jews, Muslims etc. and still believes that Christianity is the true religion, they will at least have some credibility when defending their beliefs. This goes for ALL religious beliefs. I also believe that ALL forms of extremism to be dangerous. This includes ultra liberals as well as conservatives. I personally do not acknowledge the difference between ultra conservatives or liberals. Both are closed minded extremists. This documentary brings out some very interesting points about the origins of the bible and Judeo-Christian religious beliefs and our government. However, one needs to watch this with the understanding that the film maker is using the film as a vehicle to promote his own views. The film is divided into three sections. The first segment is about religion, the second 911 conspiracy and the third the Federal Reserve Bank. The first section is trying to discredit the authenticity of the bible and the existence of Jesus Christ. It makes the claim that Jesus Christ never actually existed but was a mystical figure. It states that much of the bible as well as its central figures are based on the Precession of the Equinoxes (a period of about 25000 years) and an astrological age (a period of approx 2100 years). The 12 apostles represents the 12 constellations of the zodiac. This theory states that Christ represented the beginning of the age of Pices, the age we are still currently in. The end of times is interpreted to be the end of the age of the Pices and the beginning of the new age, the age of Aquarius. The film also gives reference to many other central figures in the bible. It tells how the story of the birth and life of Moses is identical to the story of King Sargon which evidently predates the story of Moses. The second part of the film discuses 911 and the possibility of a conspiracy. They claim that 6 of the hijackers are still alive. They mention the possibility that the steal support columns on the WTC were cut prior to the buildings being hit. This is backed up by interviews with some structural engineers. They mention the close association between the Bush and Bin Laden families. It is mentioned that George Bush had a Carlyle group meeting with Shafig Bin Laden (a relative of Osama) only shortly before the 911 incident.The third segment of the film talks about the Federal Reserve Bank (the central bank of the U.S government). They talk about the origin of the central bank, how it evolved and how it controls our economy today. The film states that the Federal Reserve is a predominately private organization. The central bank loans money to the U.S. Government with interest charged on each dollar loaned. Thus, the U.S. Government is forever in debt to the central bank. They mention John D. Rockefeller and J.P. Morgan's involvement with the central bank and how they have profited from it. They link the Federal Reserve System with all the major wars of the 20th century. They also mention the IRS and its unconstitutional practices. They also discuss the U.S. Dept. of Homeland Security and how the government is using 'terrorism' as an excuse for the Homeland Security department to violate our civil rights. I don't believe everything this films claims, but it has made me want to do more research on the Federal Reserve Bank and the Homeland Security Department as well as this 911 conspiracy theory.</fullReview>

Like President Bush, it cashes in on hate and fear after 9/11.Regardless of what Mr. Parker and Mr. Stone want you to believe, Iraq had nothing to do with the terror attacks. The peace activists said that. Also, Iraq had no weapons of mass destruction. For some reason, it is not seen as racist that America can have weapons of mass destruction, but North Korea can't. Some people have the blood of 1,900 American soldiers on their hands. Not Sean Penn.I wonder why Mr. Peter Joseph shows all the blacks in the movie as fools and traitors. They would have had Team America shooting Martin Luther King Jr., if they had any guts. We tend to honour dead saints, and slam living ones. Also, they attack gay people.Much of the armed forces serving in Iraq consits of blacks and gays. The armed forces is where you will never find Mr. Peter Joseph. He's cynical enough to appeal to patriotism. Too smart (like Bush)to believe a word of it. They probably avoid (legally) paying any more taxes than he should. Taxes help veterans. Most of these pro-war people couldn't care less about them.Join the armed forces, of any land, you have a chance to be killed, end up in a wheelchair, or shuffle around the homeless shelters.

		<shortDescription>Fact A + Fact B isn't necessarily Fact C</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is the epitome of bad documentary making. That's not to say some of the points raised were not important, there were some very thought provoking moments.The annoying thing about films like this is the way real facts and evidence are presented as truth when what is actually happening is facts are being taken from disparate sources, loosely coupled together out of context and presented as "truth".Many people have mentioned the Madrid bomb was shown under the guise of the London 7/7 bombings. Obviously they needed that shock explosion footage for the narrative, but to completely fail to mention Madrid, even as a subtitle, shows the makers want to manipulate the facts as they see fit, in the process ignoring how and why the bomb in Madrid occurred.There are also a lot of sensational "da, da, daaaa!" moments as if they've uncovered some hidden "truths" which, for informed people outside the US, aren't as revelatory as the film makers think they are (the Amero and the North American Union for example).This leads us back to the film makers agenda again. This film is primarily aimed at an ill-informed American audience, it does not present hard fact and allow one to make up ones own mind, it impresses a truth upon the viewer, a "truth" that is no more acceptable than the"untruths" it purports to be revealing.However, there are many thought provoking moments in this film which, if removed from the noise of the disjointed facts, are quite pertinent and well made.Yet ultimately, creating films in this way undermines its entire argument as it's easy to pick apart such wobbly logic. Thus the statement and impact this film is trying to make is also lost.</fullReview>

Between us, I don't necessarily believe in the security of my country anyway, I don't need a drama-documentary to add paranoia-fantasy to the equation. I will only believe one part of 9/11 theory, the State has something to do with it. But come on! How many people to you need to corrupt to organise such a big thing? Without any leak what so ever?This documentary uses popular methods to convince you step by step: - A fact you can't accept (but deep inside you like to entertain that dream, secret organisations, world against you, just like "what is zone 51?"). "Paranoia" is the word. - A half-scientific/half-fictional explanation: two people talking about their "expert" point of view. Who are they? Suddenly you trust them blindly. Can an ex-MI5 (London attempts) talk about private operations? Doesn't he swear confidentiality to his State?- A LOT of drama, especially music that goes more and more intense whilst more and more nonsense is spoken. - Powerful words like "control", "manipulation", "state". - The idea that you are thinking by yourself because no reply straight away, just a "Why?", 15 minutes of exposure of "facts" and then a nice little "The choice is yours", "think for yourself".I think this is how the documentary should be seen before jumping on your seat "My god, we are manipulated!". Some kind of hidden fantasy, we like everything that is so big to be true.Don't get me wrong, I believe the United States have some implication in the sense that they knew, somehow, that this was going to happen, they were warn. But didn't organise it all from A to Z, put some bombs in the building and all the rest of it.Open to discussionFrank Ench</fullReview>

The first part alone was so riddled with factual errors that even though the other two parts raise interesting questions, I'm inclined to doubt them, although I am nowhere near informed enough to tell lie from truth in the last two parts.The major issue that I have with the main part is that it mixes a lot of inaccuracies with only a sprinkling of facts.Fact: Sirius ALWAYS lines with Orion's belt, and not only around December 25th... It does appear near the horizon every year around that time, hence the reliability of astronomical calendars because stars DO NOT apparently move in relation to one another... whereas planets do.Fact : Helios is Greek for Sun and Uios is Greek for Son. Sole is Sun in Latin, and Filius is Son... playing on words in English is really weak...Fact : Prometheus (listed in the list of avatars for Christ) wasn't from Caucasus, but rather condemned by Zeus to be chained there to have his liver eaten day after day by a vulture, never crucified or resurrected, idem for Mithra, born from a rock, Horus and all the other deities.If you wish to imply that religion has been subverted to become an instrument of control, be my guest, there's plenty of FACTS to back that up.Same for the conspiracy theories by governments and banks...

		<fullReview>This has the same theme as many conspiracy videos made since 9/11/01. It is presented fairly well. I think they need to dig a little deeper in their research of Christianity though. There was no mention of the original day of worship for Christianity which was Saturday and still is kept as such by several denominations. This puts one hole in their theory. Also, December 25th is not regarded as the actual day Jesus was born. It is merely the day in which people celebrate his birth. Another hole. Furthermore, the pagan symbology we see in Christianity today came later due to one of two reasons, 1, infiltration of the pagan sun cults and 2, proselytizers within Christianity doing what they could to lure in converts. These reasons are the same for the day of worship being changed and the holidays "borrowed" from the cults as well.</fullReview>

I have lots of examples: read something about Horus and you will see that he wasn't crucified, nor born of a virgin or in December 25th (that's just ridiculous! it's a pagan festivity associated with Christianity when roman empire became Christian). Krishna wasn't resurrected, he die and his soul became immortal, as its tradition says. Is not the same. Mythra was born of his FATHER. So he doesn't have a MOTHER, so he wasn't born of a virgin. A fast list of gods is showed to us briefly and we are told that all of them have similarities with Jesus. The problem is that the list is a LIE, not a MISTAKE. Lots of the names are not gods at all and... Thor and Loki from the Gaul? Was he an Axterix cousin or something? Even if you read Marvel Comics' version of Thor you'll know that is a Scandinavian god, not a Gaul one!! The list goes on very fast, so... it doesn't matter if they're saying the truth or lying? Well, it matters to me. I don't like to be lied. The second part is the best so far... And here we have FACTS not speculation. Here, they have respected sources (as David Ray Griffin, author of The New Pearl Harbor: Disturbing Questions About Bush Administration and 9/11 or former police officer Michael C. Ruppert whose investigations are widely recommended). Anyway, I rather recommend better films like Loose Change Final Cut or Eric Hufschmid's Panful Deceptions to approach this issue. But you can't compare this faithful sources with the ones used on parts I and III. This is a very important matter: I do believe that 9/11 was a false flag attack with government and media complicity to hide truth from the people. Is not a "conspiracy theory" or, at least, is the most believable one, since the "official truth" is also a conspiracy theory (of Muslims leadered by Osama Bin Laden, but a conspiracy so far). We have evidence pointing that side, but I don't think people realize this with Zeitgeist, mainly because third part is a LAUGHABLE conspiracy theory (you surely can say it with a derogatory sense here) with "men behind curtains", false quotes (Benjamin Franklin quote is FALSE, he never said what the movie quotes, JFK speech is quoted out of context and his significance adulterated http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=8093) and lots of half truths and plain lies about economy and financial system and the events of the foundation of FED and basic history of United States that even foreigners like me can figure out by reading something in Wikipedia. Also, the sources they use are very strange and not very respected by historians and philosophers, like this Edward Griffin (http://www.freedom-force.org/freedom.cfm?fuseaction=issues) a guy who claims to have found Noe's Ark and that AIDS doesn't exists and you can be promiscuous and not to use condoms without any danger. A madman and a murder as I can see, but also, a Zeitgest source of the "truth". So, it is good to encourage people to think by themselves and compare facts, but it is better if you do it BEFORE to write a praise of how wonderful and enlightening is this pile of falsehood and lies named as a "documentary". This is useless because is made for people that naturally disbelieve of "official truth", like myself. The second part is actually important to understand U.S.A. present and its influence in the whole world. The rest is just manipulated information to make you believe things that are untrue. You don't alter quotes in a documentary. You don't create facts in a documentary. You not manipulate the public doing exactly what you are criticizing (sorry if misspelled). That's dishonest and improper. Shame on you. If you want to change the world, then DO something (enter the labor union, recycle, use a bike, take care about the water and food you spend, be a member of a pacifist group) and stop looking "man behind curtains" to avoid responsibility. It distract you from the real threat. I'm beginning to wander if that is the final goal of this "documentary" at the very end: confuse and distract people from the REAL issues and problems of the world like "war on terror" (a direct consequence of an issue that Zeitgeist approached), alimentary crisis, global warming, poverty, natural disasters, etc. Read a book, novels are far better than conspiracy theories. I don't find the difference between Zeitgeist's fanatic defenders or evangelists who deny evolution and claims the world is 6000 old like those in Jesus Camp, another movie worth watching and far serious than this one. United States are becoming "land of fanaticism, home of the dumb". Nuff said'</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This so called "eye-opener" is just a baseless pseudo-documentary. It has no base for what it states as a fact. It kinda tells you "Open your eyes. Do not believe what the establishment says because everything is a big conspiracy to rule the world and you will lose your freedom". But... isn't this a kind of terrorism the film is doing itself? To scare people to control them?From the Chapter 1 which talks about Christianism, if you have ever read history books you can say the film lies to you big time, and not because you are Christian, but because they are clearly inventing false information. They compare Jesus with a bunch of ancient gods. In these lines, how can they say as a fact that Horus was born on Dec-25 if there are no records of such a thing? And actually there are no records saying that Jesus was born on Dec-25 in the first place! That is just an example of how this film lies. It is actually laughable. The last straw comes when they say that in a near future the government will implant you a RFID chip to take control of your life. Yeah, that ridiculous idea was something many religions have been claimed as the mark of the beast, for about 30 years!The film rage against something it is itself! If they say everything is a lie, why should you believe what the film claims? A pseudo-documentary very well made since it has recruited so many people in their "Zeitgeist movement" using tactics of apocalyptic speech. It's funny and scary how people are so easy to deceive with good speech. I really feel sorry for the people who think they were "woken-up" by this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nicely wrapped but not factual and certainly not a documentary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, lets just make one thing clear. This is NOT a documentary. It is not the truth, even the producer on the movies own homepage says it isn't! Zeitgeist is a very nicely wrapped money scam, nothing else. Hey if someone is stupid enough to buy the books, T-shirts and DVDs the makers of this movie should have credit for that. It is a well made scam and I bet they are making money. It is easy to get sucked in as the message in cleverly displayed. However, the movie is loaded with factual faults and lies. Many of the quotes are taken out of context, changed, or even made up!So should you watch this movie? YES, I think you should as an exercise in how easy you could be manipulated by a well wrapped message. You can yourself disprove many of the "facts" in the movie yourself without much effort. You can also have a look at various pages debunking the movie for example "conspiracyscience com". I think everyone in social sciences and history class should have this video and then debunk it as a part of the curriculum so people learn to think for themselves. That is in a way ironic considering it is one of the main messages of the film ...Vote 2/10. Why? Well the movie is a nice potpourri of various conspiracy theories and bundled as "truth". It is very well made I will give it that. However, I have little respect for "documentaries" that first of all don't have any credits. The source list on the web page is laughable at best and if you actually should get hold of any of the listed books you are lucky. If you know anything about how to present sources to be credible this is NOT how to do it.What makes me most worried though is the wast amount of comments (not only here) about how the movie "changed their life", "I immediately denounced my fate" etc. Yes the movie IS an eye opener. It shows how gullible people are. If that was the true intent of this movie it would be a masterpiece!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to say the first time I watched this film it freaked me out. As a person of faith I was personally hurt by part one. I realize that Peter Joseph was not speaking directly to me but he did not take faithful people into account when he made this piece of propaganda. Its hard to speak on the subjects brought up in this film because of the confidence Joseph exudes when narrating his narrow minded point of view. I don't see why he feels so attacked by the world and the United States government. My question to him would be "Who is stopping you from doing anything?" I would point out that his film was posted on the internet for months without getting him thrown in jail witch by his own standards would be the immediate action of the so called "powers that be." Don't get me wrong I was impressed with the film. It was well put together and very compelling to watch as an aspiring filmmaker. I just wish Joseph would use his "powers" for good instead of evil. In the film he states scare tactics are a form of control and the film itself is, in a lot of ways, a medium of scare tactics. For example: the film makes some outrageous claims about the afterlife the world around us and the future as if to say there is no hope for any of it. Except, of course, if we get enough of our friends to watch this film with us we might, just maybe, be able to "overcome." ?????I just don't see a reason to stir up all these emotions and break down all these natural trusts we have in society, religion and leadership to leave us with "watch my movie again. You'll be enlightened!" Please! Spare me the psycho atheist gibberish and just come out and say it. You hate America and want to destroy all pillars of society. And if you truly feel that way then you should reexamine the reason for it? Is it to make a new equal civilization of love and beauty? Or is it to readjust the power structure so that you end up on top. At least those who are spiritually mature can look to God for guidance and support in overcoming the evils and offenses of this world. By the way, I find it interesting that Peter and Joseph are both biblical names. Why turn away from them. Just a thought.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was appalled by the movie, specially by the treatment of Christianity. When will, or rather, will people ever understand that Christianity is not about the money, but the wicked people are just trying to use it this way sometimes? It's about love, and how love is a conspiracy? It is clear that the writer/director or whoever made this movie understands nothing of the personal relationship with God and lives in the world of sins and sensations, that follow those sins. Let's picture this - if there were no God's commandments would it make world a better place? If there wouldn't be a "You shall not kill" - everyone would be killing each other, and there wouldn't ever be a reason to stop it. So what problem are the creator's of the movie having with commandments or faith in God? They do not believe in God, but hey - they for some reason believe astrological nonsense and all the other so-called "sciences" that people are trying to developed based on their limited mind. The bottom line is that the movie is full of ideas, but I wonder, would any of these ideas make the world a better place for people? I think not, creators are not thinking how to make the world a better place, they just look for something to mock on and get rich themselves. That's what losers do.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a shame, looked promising until the 9/11 conspiracy stuff came up, all of the "facts" it presents have been easily disproved many times over, but these nutters just keep on adding fantasy upon fantasy to try and make their story stick. I find it difficult to fathom the mind set of a conspiracy nut, they obviously suffer from paranoia, and feel the need for everyone else to suffer from paranoia also, perhaps this makes themselves feel a little better. Actually I can't stand conspiracy theorists anymore, it's like trying to argue with a religious zealot. The worst thing they do is to try and remove the blame from the scum that committed those terrible acts and try to blame others.And then it dawns on you that all the other "facts" this film presents are most likely as poorly researched and disingenuous as the 9/11 conspiracy rantings. I wonder did the film maker even know what he was pushing was a pack of lies, did he really care? I mean there is so much money to be made in this conspiracy rubbish, why not make a movie full of lies and present it as the truth.The truth about 9/11 is within easy reach if you want it, if you want to believe in a conspiracy, then you will see it everywhere you look. I don't trust governments unequivocally, I'm not naive, but just take a look at the conspiracy debunking information and they easily show just how ridiculous the claim that the U.S. government was behind it is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's kind of ironic that so many people think they're being "free thinkers" for doubting the government, and yet are completely willing to believe everything said by this documentary, even though a significant portion of the claims it makes can be discredited by a simple Google search. The information given in Zeitgeist is dubious at best, and outlandish at worst. For example, with no evidence whatsoever, it claims that ALL popular media exists solely as part of a conspiracy to stop people from thinking. As if without television, everyone would just sit there and ponder philosophy... Considering that television and mass-media as we know it have only existed during the last century, and that same century gave rise to more scientific innovation than any other period in history, clearly media does not make people dumber by any means.That's just one example of a million things that are wrong with the claims made in this documentary. It would take hours and hours to write about everything that's wrong with it. For example, look up pretty much any god out of the enormous list of gods that this documentary claims share the same origin story with Jesus to find even more apparently made-up claims. (Start with Horus, for example. He does NOT have the same origin story as Jesus, at all, even though the documentary claims he does, with no evidence of course...) So I'll just leave this with one final thought: If someone was telling you about how every single important event in modern history was due entirely to conspiracy, and they were homeless on a street corner rather than an underground documentary filmmaker, how much credit would you give their ideas? Chances are, you'd think they were just nuts.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is not a documentary, this is a fraud</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie sounds like a cheap television documentary about how extraterrestrial helped build the Easter Island statue. Though it has a facade of critical thinking about religion, the intellectual framework of such a movie does not depart from religious thinking. It has nothing to do with rationality. In rational thinking - like science, you have a hypothesis and then you do everything you can to prove it wrong. If you or anyone - including your worst enemy - cannot break your hypothesis, if with all the evidences gathered and experiment done, if with all criticisms, your hypothesis still hold, then you are on something that might become accept as a rational "truth". That is more or less how science constructs theories - like the infamous Darwinian theory of evolution or Big bang theory. In irrational thinking - like conspiracy theories, you have a hypothesis but this time you do everything to prove it right. This means that you don't explore the whole picture. You discard anything that shakes your hypothesis as rubbish ? without proving why it is rubbish invoking instead common sense. You prefer a complex solution to a problem rather than the simpler solution that would disprove your hypothesis. The point is not to find the truth but to prove you are right. It is not uncommon, in order to achieve this goal, to make use of a convenient agent like God or the conspirators. Therefore this movie is definitively not a case for anything but the delusion of the author. Note also how all the so call evidences are a patchwork of different sources that are not put in context by an expert on the matter. All of you who think that kind of Internet movie is clever are a) delusional, b) stupid and c) lethargic. This guy is obviously a nobody ? could not find anything about him - who spent hours obsessing about his hypothesis and went on gathering all the information he could to edit in a cheap television documentary style this piece of propaganda ? another word to describe irrational thinking. I find quite troubling and disgraceful to invoke a criticism of Christianity to justify nonsense. I am an atheist and criticizing religion means thinking, like really thinking in a rational manner, finding both side of the argument, wondering what is the expertise of anyone claiming to deliver the "Truth". Don't you get it? Are you too brainwash? Too delusional?You are exchanging a bag of apple for a bag of apple. Religion and conspiracy theory, same thing. So if you don't want to be brave and put your beliefs to the test, don't bother, just enjoy life and skip voting ? I actually encourage clueless people to give up their democratic rights for the greater good.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Most conspiracies movies are quite good, but sometimes it was done intentionally wrong to discredit these new group of people. One event came to mind about an email from Reuters sent to people that Nostradamus predicted the World Trade Center, by misquoting him. When people found out, Nostradamus was eventually discredited. There ARE good movies that relates to this topic and Christianity and source reference materials mentioned in the movie, were incorrect, in fact Zeitgeist the Challenge, which pays people money if they can prove the 50 claims by the movie Zeitgeist shows that the powers that be is trying to infiltrate the conspiracy movement. There are other farce conspiracy movies such as In 9/11 Plane Sight and one on moon hoax, by trying to say the hoax can't be penetrated, of course it can, one obvious one is there's not enough area in the space shuttle for the space suit to get out, and this is verified. However, back to the movie that was made during this same theme that I do recommend is Empire of the City - The Ring of Power, which deals with the issue of Christianity (I am not a Christian) much more better and made a lot more sense as to the origins of Christianity. As to the issue of income tax, Aaron Russo movies are good (he's good because the Oscar didn't even pay tribute to him - if they did, it's not a good movie), but also Edward G. Griffin, which are well accepted by the community, but not for Zeitgeist, and amazingly, Ring of Power is unusually silent or unrated one even by IMDb. So I think some rating by IMDb is bias or manipulated. If you don't believe me just compare Ring of Power and Zeitgeist, read other people who challenged the Zeitgeist claims. Zeitgeist the movie hold no water. The intention of anti-conspiracies movie is basically, infiltrate and to divide and conquer the conspiracy theorist. I think personally that David Icke is infiltrated, by disrepute himself on the alien issue about transforming into another being. The most recent one that the internet community has basically put in disrepute, is The Inconvenient Truth, being effectively overturn by an relatively little known, The Global Warming Swindle. Despite its low budget, the truth speaks for itself. Remember we have seen this before even in the Alien Autopsy, which is also basically overturned by the community. One of the most important thought is, don't allow the powers that be divide and conquer a small but growing conspiracy theorists, on more solid issues, 911 is an inside job, Federal Reserve is a private corporation, or the income tax is illegal. The best judge of anything is simply to check the facts. No one's fact is good, including me, so check them yourself.

The film makers are trying to prove this by showing us a zodiac system, solar movements and summarize the ideas of each religion.Most painful with part one is the fifteen minute beginning which is a totally pointless and boring music-video-like bombardment of news-footage to some sort of "scary" music.The second part tries to prove that the 9/11-attacks were in some way orchestrated by the Bush administration. The problem is that all "proof" that these film makers put out have been de-bunked before. They use photos that comes from other places or are not from the dates they try to make out. The film makers clearly have no idea what they have gotten into.Third part is the most confusing. Here the film makers are hitting hard against multiple enemies. The Central Bank, the national ID-card, the so called North American Union, the religious groups, the underdeveloped education system, the non-income tax law... All of this is attacked. And poorly so.The film makers wants us to believe the old story about that there is no income tax law in USA and therefor you don't need to pay income tax. Later they tell us that the education system is bad and is so for a reason: so people shouldn't educate themselves and think for themselves so they don't see what the government is up to.Well, if there were no income tax, you wouldn't have an education system at all. And with higher income tax you could even have a better education system. This never strikes the film makers as a good idea...Same is with the national ID-card. They believe it's made so the citizens can be controlled. Well, I've been living in a country with this system for all my life, and the only thing it does is to save me from identity theft and make my money secure in the bank, and let me pay the proper tax and let me prove my age and identity. An ID-card is exactly what USA needs.The whole documentary is extremely tedious. The film makers don't go out and interview any important people. Instead they interview weirdos with their own agendas, as Aaron Russo, or quote anti-semitic lunatics as Louis Thomas McFadden.And the documentary makes no attempt to tie the three parts together. It's just totally ridiculous and an awful experience to sit through it.The research made for this film is stupid. The editing is lame and boring. At least half the film could have been left out. Most of the film can be de-bunked easily by viewing the original documents or checking up the facts yourself.Overall: a terrible film that has no value. Waste of time.1/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Attack On Jesus? Nothing New, In Fact</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Two thousand years ago, Jesus said to His disciples in Luke 6:22: Happy are you, when men have hate for you, and put you away from among them and say angry words to you, turning away in disgust at your name, because of the Son of man. And He was absolutely right. Today, 2000 years later, in the fetid and ungodly age of Postmodernism, the attacks on Jesus and His followers never cease to happen and only become stronger and more cynical. The Zeitgeist movie is nothing new. We have heard that old silly fairy tale about the Egyptian origins of Christianity countless times. What is important, all those really brainless attacks are never successful. Jesus has been under fire of criticism for ages, and what? His Word spreads out. The film itself starts with a very funny idea that if, viewers, do not share the creators' ideas, we are idiots by default. Very wise, indeed. As if we do not have our own wits to see and realize that the movie is a hilarious array of pots-modernism, astrology, wild imagination and vicious attacks on Jesus. The parts about George Bush's grandfather, microchips and all those speculations are just an overflow of sick imagination and godless aggression. So, folks, watch it for laughs, watch it as a manual how our enemies try and attack us, and watch it as a hopeless, force-less, pointless exercise of idiocy. All thumbs down to Michael Moore and his hatred to President Bush, and all my condolence to filmmakers. They belong to a lunatic asylum. Rating is 0, but since there is no such level for a broth like that, I give it a miserable 1 ? Very Poor, Extremely Silly and Totally Brainless.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie Zeitgeist has very quickly had a fanatically following on the internet. The people who believe in it feel that they have shared a discovery of some big secret. A secret that tells us, that all religions in the world are part of some massive conspiracy, for some people to rule the world. Sounds like a book by Dan Brown. And actually this whole movie is much like the world of Dan Brown, where facts and fiction are often the same. Do you people really think it is possible for this ONE person who made this person, to have discovered this secret, while all the millions of religion-scholars (past and present) who research religion daily have overlooked it for thousands of years? Do you really think one person without an education as a scholar in religion to have found a secret where millions of scholars, priests and imams have overlooked the obvious? Of course not.This movie is false. I am an atheist, so I should believe in this, because it tells that all religions are false. But the movie is just like Dan Browns "The Da Vinci Code" ? full of conspiracy theories that people would like to believe in. But like "The Da Vinci Code", Zeitgeist is also just based on undocumented conspiracy theories and brainless speculations. Just because one religion shares some traits or numbers of some "gods" or "prophets" does NOT mean that they are part of some conspiracy to control the masses. Use your own thinking. If you manipulate facts long enough, and take enough facts about the given religion out of context, then of course you'll find a connection. I could also by using the same methods of Zeitgeist, find that Harry potter is part of some Babylonian religion, along with Ghostbusters. But that doesn't mean it's real. If you look long enough then you will find connections, but connection that were never there, and are only coincidental. Just because the number 12 is found to be holy in many religions, does not mean that they are all part of some conspiracy. Stop the paranoia! Why do you people always think that all things happen for a reason? They seldom do. Just because Religions emerge doesn't mean that they are part of some conspiracy. Just because idiotic wars happen, doesn't mean it is part of some grander plan and conspiracy. People simply just want to believe in conspiracy theories, it's a new religion. This movie is just the latest book in the conspiracy theorists bible. Evidently pure logic can debunk all the false claims of this so called documentary. And just to mention it again: this movie is just made by a single person, an amateur. It is simply not creditable that he can research and prove things that thousands of people that worked with the same things for countless of years cannot acknowledge.Stop the paranoia. Stop believing in documentary-films, just because you can find them on the internet.</fullReview>

It's motivation, essentially the same as the 17th and 18th century "Enlightenment"--with all its disastrous consequences.For anyone interested in the all-too-real crisis confronting modern society try Eric Voegelin's "A New Science of Politics" or Alisdair MacIntyre's "After Virtue" (both books by qualified, bona fide, political theorists).What you have here is mere conjecture, shallow at that, by filmmakers (i.e., entertainers) with no clear understanding of their own civilization much less others.Moreover, the appeal here is to emotion or the visual senses, not to experience, reason, or the historical record. This is more of a symptom or sign of the times, rather than a careful exploration of the spirit of the age.So go on believing this nonsense. It is akin to believing shadows on the wall represent true reality. And in the end, you'll find yourself down a dark, dead-end, having taken the last vestiges of your civilization with you. The course of civilization is in the balance ... (and it all comes down to a popularity vote?).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>May be we all should learn one thing from this movie: one may not believe things too easily.Cuz it's hard to believe there are people, that allow to brainwash them with such cheap piece of disinformation like this movie.Hardly any strong evidence - just questions, circumstantial "evidence" and blur, contradictory announcements, supported by neither trustworthy sources nor professional objective opinions. In fact, most sources are same conspiracy-lovers.Hardly any dissenting opinions - just a governmental version of 9-11, which, as any hypothesis, may have defects, but doesn't crush under pressure of dozens of so well crafted and so controversially "proven" homemade piles of hyper-interpretations. In fact, as so many propagandistic works, this movie takes governmental betrayal for granted.------------------------------------------------------------- What would I suggest for everyone, who watched the movie or read some what-really-really-happened-to-WTC-book? Look for "Opration lune" (2002) aka "Dark Side of the Moon" (imdb number tt0344160), a great piece of documentary work, which shows how easily this kind of conspiracy documentaries are made.Watch the South Park episode 1009 - Mystery of the Urinal Deuce, a hilarious satire.-------------------------------------------------------------- Think about what the movie is really saying below the line. Christianity is related to many other religions, that it even took parts of them and adapted for itself? Who did not know that? That the Bush administration, rotten under its cronyism, could not stop terrorist attacks? Big news.That discussion about RFID-chips-controlled world happens right now? It's in every popular science magazine, opinions are not swept under the carpet.Internet is full of crap, learn to recognize what's credible.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sounds plausible? Think for yourself.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>People love conspiracy theories about religions, secret societies, governments...and often believe them without question! That's probably because it is easier than researching further and thinking for oneself.The conspiracies movies/books have really one motive: to enrich the director/author by lightening the pockets of the gullible people they claim to be enlightening with 'knowledge'. This is why their research is always scant but they draw massive conclusions.Educated scholars have studied history and argued for and against the existence of Jesus for hundreds of years - it's nothing new (a quick internet search will reveal this). Yet the movie explains it all in twenty minutes? And yes, the world banking systems are flawed and modern money is not real nor backed by anything (gold and silver may well be on the way back to fixing that issue). And yes, wars are often started by design and yes the public is often fooled e.g. WMD in Iraq.Simplistically speaking, these are all driven by our instincts for survival of the fittest. This begins with conquering those that are perceived a threat and cornering as much power/money as one can. And yes, bankers and business will always try to profit from these situations, but this does not make them conspiracies.Individuals have always been powerless against the 'system' unless they had money to buy their way out of trouble, legally or otherwise. The ultimate outcome of human nature may indeed be a single world government, but I hope by then individual rights will be treasured, not removed for the 'greater good'.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How can you affirm that Jesus Christ never existed and end the movie with a phrase: When power of love overcomes the love of power, the world will know peace by Jimmy Hendrix!!! Jesus is Love!!! He before all said that we have a power within that's greater than anything. The astrological remarks are very interesting and probably true. It is true that Jesus was not born on th 25th of December. But let's remember that the Church with Constantine changed the scripts and the image of Christ. The end part of the movie is actually based on what the real Jesus Christ wanted us to understand! And by the way our era ends in the year 2012 according to the Maya, not 2050!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A contrived, manipulative, and dangerous piece of propaganda</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We live in a frightening age under a corrupt and increasingly incompetent government, so it little wonder that films like Zeitgeist: The Movie are finding success. Many of the issues it addresses do ask some important questions, particularly those concerning the origins of Christianity and the American Government's connection to 9/11. Zeitgeist flies off the rails, however, when it attempts to answer these questions.There is ample evidence for a historical man named Yeashua (Jesus in Hebrew) leading followers around the time of Emperor Tiberius. The details of his life, however, were subject to manipulation over the years by numerous different scholars. It is thus hard to separate fact from fiction when examining his life. The film is even further off when addressing the U.S. government's alleged link to 9/11. A prime example of this is the film's support of the theory that the pentagon was hit by a missile and not a plane. This theory has been dismissed by most 9/11 conspiracy theorists themselves as being false. Further theories are presented and backed up with anecdotal evidence, but not much else. There is little or no attempt to present alternative viewpoints on these highly controversial matters.The final third of the film is perhaps the worst. It presents its own take on the Theory of Electronic Conspiracy as if it were hard fact. A small group of bankers, namely the Federal Reserve Bank, are blamed for most of the world's ills since the mid 1910s. This is a particularly dangerous accusation as many such theories have historically been antisemitic in nature, and it is no coincidence that the film uses testimonies from such questionable sources as Rep. Louis McFadden (a noted racist and supporter of Adolf Hitler).I won't deny the film was skillfully made. It very cleverly avoided any alternative viewpoints and backed up its own demented world view with just enough evidence to be convincing. It is, however, no more real than "Triumph of the Will" or "Birth of a Nation". At least these movies were better made (why in God's name is its IMDb rating so high?!!)...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Is it creditable?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie: "Zeitgeist" is a popular conspiracy theory video, which aims to prove that all religions in the world are false, and based on a lie. The conclusion is that all religion is part of some massive, invisible and secret conspiracy to make the population of the world docile and make them sheep. But is the movie creditable? Can this be true? You have to use ockham's razor on the subject, to find out what is true and what is not. Is it possible for all the major religions in the world to be part of the SAME conspiracy? If all religions are part of the same conspiracy, then why haven't all the millions of scholars and other educated people on the subject reported about it? How come an uneducated amateur journalist (Peter Joseph) can find all these conspiracies behind all religions, when millions of educated and uneducated people could not see them in the past? Either Peter Joseph is lying, or all the millions of scholars in religion are lying. To be more sceptical, you have to look at "Zeitgeist" without accepting its facts blindly. "Zeitgeist" is ONLY made by one person: Peter Joseph. He is NOT a scholar in religion. He has ONLY used the INTERNET for finding this massive conspiracy behind EVERY RELIGION. So is that creditable, that one amateur can find this horrible truth, only using questionable websites and undocumented claims? No, it is not. This movie is not creditable. It is false. It would be quite ludicrous to think that all religions in the world somehow were part of some massive conspiracy. That would make for good SCIENCE FICTION. But fortunately we live in the real world. Such a big conspiracy is just not possible ? it just isn't. People create and want to believe in these massive conspiracy theories because that makes the world much more imaginative than it really is. This conspiracy theory is simply just a substitute for religion. Because it is about faith: this theory does not make sense if you think of it. It is far fetched. It is not true. "Zeitgeist" is NOT creditable. It aims to disprove all religion, but it is in reality just a substitute for religion ? like all conspiracy theories. Let us forget this movie and get on with our lives.</fullReview>
