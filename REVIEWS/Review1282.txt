		<shortDescription>Fun, fast-paced B-movie with a fun cast</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While none of the four Dick Tracy films made by RKO in the 1940's are particularly extraordinary they're fun, the actors are charming, and the atmosphere of the films is nice and seedy. Plus, they often mixed in a little sci-fi and some comic strip style humor (such as characters named Dr. A. Tomic and I. M. Learned) in with the bargain basement film noir that manages to set the films somewhat apart from other crime-themed B-films of the time.The final film in the series, Dick Tracy Meets Gruesome, is probably the best of the four, mostly due to the absolutely wonderful cast. Boris Karloff is dependably creepy and charismatic as the main villain. Minor 1940's B-movie icon, Ann Gwynne is the sexiest Tess Trueheart of the early films. The incomparably menacing, ghostly Skelton Knaggs plays X-Ray and, like he always did, steals every scene he's in. Everyone is great.The story, concerning Karloff using a gas that puts people into temporary suspended animation to rob a bank, moves at a gallop and is delivered with humor and style. There's not a dull moment in the film and it's more than worth the vintage B-movie enthusiast's time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Karloff Excels in a Solid Dick Tracy Feature</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ralph Byrd is well-suited to the role of Dick Tracy, and this is a solid B-feature overall. But it is Boris Karloff, in the role of "Gruesome", who lifts the movie above the norm for its genre. He makes his character come vividly to life, and makes him into a believable and formidable foe for Tracy.The story is enjoyable, if a bit on the wacky side, with a gang of criminals taking advantage of a gas that is supposed to cause temporary paralysis in anyone who breathes it. Tess and Pat also get their moments as they help Tracy track down the gang.Karloff was an impressive and unusual talent, using his appearance, voice, and mannerisms in all kinds of ways, generally relying on the little things and on understated actions to create his character. He was certainly in a number of movies of far greater stature than this one, but in this, as in almost all of his roles, he is very interesting to watch, and he adds a great deal to the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Boris Karloff Elevates This Dick Tracy Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was my first look at one of these old Dick Tracy movies. I believe most of them were very short, like those, a little over an hour long, and pretty fast-moving. Apparently, this is the fourth and last one of the films. I read where many people think it's the best, so I started here....and wasn't disappointed. It was entertaining.What I found, at least in this movie, was a mixture of crime and some humor. Here, too, was a little sci-fi thrown in as someone invented a gas that would freeze anyone near it for about 15 minutes. The crooks, of course, freeze everyone at the First National Bank, and then go in and rob it. (These were the days before video cameras.) Early on, one of the characters mentions something about a creepy-looking guy, "someone like Boris Karloff." The guy WAS Boris Karloff. Later, a doctor who could help the police figure out this mystery gas goes by the name of "Dr. A. Tomic," physicist. Still later, there is a dramatic scene in a room with a big sign that reads, "Y. Stuffem, taxidermist." The film is full of these little corny things making it a crime-comedy type of story.Yet, the bad guys are tough guys. Karloff is convincing as a big thug who would kill without remorse. To me, he really makes this movie and elevates the crime angle of it beautifully. He was one-of-a-kind: had the perfect look and voice for scary roles on film. Skelton Knaggs, as "X-ray," as a frightening face.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Go X-Ray!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a good little film and the first one that I saw Skelton Knaggs listed in the credits--he is a hoot to watch as X-Ray!! Something about this late actor is funny to watch, I don't know if it is his voice or his looks or what, but he is something else in this film.But I found this film to be very enjoyable and fun to watch--in fact, all of the Dick Tracy films from the 1940's are good ones. Good character names all around--Lee Thal, A.Tomic-- wonder if they came from the comic strip or the screenwriters? Either way, I like the play on words. But, it is a good film and if you enjoy harmless fun, be sure and catch this one if it on television.!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gruesome is quite good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My first introduction to Dick Tracy was the cartoon series of the 1950s (60s?) and then later the Sunday comics. I saw the big screen Warren Beatty/ Madonna effort and was curious about these earlier efforts. I wasn't expecting much but was pleasantly surprised by this adaptation. Gruesome, played by Boris Karloff, looks as if he just stepped out of the Chester Gould strip (without the lavish makeup of the 1990s version) and several supporting characters also have the grotesque look that made the comic popular. The story revolves around a mysterious gas that can temporarily freeze people. While they're in suspended animation, the baddies can rob the bank (the perfect plan huh?) Anyway, it's up to Dick Tracy (Ralph Byrd) to solve the mystery and put an end to Gruesome's crime spree. It's all good fun with more plot than you'd expect and a solid amount of screen time to Karloff. Humour peppers the thrills to make it an enjoyable film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not to be overlooked</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If we sometimes pay lip service to the notion that Boris Karloff was a fine actor, we are hard-pressed to offer examples - unless we mean his memorable gallery of monsters, mummies, mad scientists and assorted grotesques. In this unlikely film can be found one of the best performances of his career: that of a criminal, to be sure, but an ominous character who projects menace rather than horror. Karloff underplays the ruthless, single-minded social misfit whose manner is close enough to the norm to enable him to move among commonplace types without attracting undue attention, but is at the same time sufficiently glowering to intimidate even his henchmen. Among the latter is a perfectly contrasted ally in the person of Skelton Knaggs. About the rest (apart from the tantalizing opening shot)...the less said, the better. But here is a B picture raised to the level of B+ by the solid work of a genuine professional.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Smart? He's weird. I tell 'ya, if I didn't know better I'd swear we were doing business with Boris Karloff."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I got a great kick out of the line Dick Tracy's detective assistant Pat Patton (Lyle Latell) used referencing the star of the film. It's the second time I know of when Boris Karloff or one of his characters is called by name in a movie. In "Charlie Chan At The Opera", a stage manager responds to a ruckus in the theater by proclaiming - "This opera is going on tonight even if Frankenstein walks in!""Dick Tracy Meets Gruesome" is a wonderful take on the comic strip of the 1940's and '50's as I remember them. You always had those great play on word names for characters; here two of the principals are Dr. A. Tomic and his aide I.M. Learned, while Boris Karloff as Gruesome takes up with a gangster named Lee Thal. When Tracy investigates a taxidermy parlor later in the film, a sign reveals the name of the owner as Y. Stuffum. It's too bad audiences of today are too sophisticated to find the fun in this kind of punditry.At the center of the story is a newly discovered gas formula that renders it's victims motionless, and comes in handy for Gruesome in pulling off a bank job. That scene brought to mind an episode of 'The Twilight Zone' which would have come out some years later; if memory serves that story also took place in a bank. The plot didn't seem to hold together all too consistently as to the effectiveness of the gas formula. In the warehouse scene when Gruesome attempts to render Tracy motionless to capture him, the villain enters the area where he set off the gas capsule shortly after with no ill effect. The film's windup which follows had Tracy and Gruesome in a bit of a contrived cat and mouse game exchanging gunfire. The elevator hauling the villain off to the furnace had me a bit nervous but fortunately justice wasn't carried that far. For his part, Ralph Byrd as Dick Tracy reminded me a little bit of actor Pat O'Brien. Tracy's girlfriend Tess Trueheart was played fetchingly by Anne Gwynne, and rounding out the bad guy cast were Skelton Knaggs as X-Ray and Tony Barrett as piano player Melody.This is the first Dick Tracy film I've seen, and it had enough of the Chester Gould comic strip fun to suggest looking up some of the other titles. As a fan of the genre, I found it to compare favorably to other detective series of the era, notably Charlie Chan, Bulldog Drummond and Mr. Moto. For a decidedly different view of Boris Karloff, try catching him in any one of the five films he starred in portraying the Oriental Detective Mr. Wong.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Get that cat out of here!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What is that cat doing in the bank, again? Lex Barker, soon to become Tarzan is here in an ambulance driver role. He looks so good everyone forgets the plot. Meanwhile Gruesome gets away.The chatty bank guard is good.Boris Karloff wanted to be gruesomer than usual so he decided to copy Moe's hairstyle from the Three Stooges. It works. Karloff is excellent but you wouldn't want Gruesome for a piano bar date. The piano player/mobster never plays piano. They should have had Liberace in that role. It really would have worked.The newspaper reporter could have tried for a spin-off.I see this movie all the time at the 99 Cent Store. It is a great bargain. It is a good print of the film. The car chases are much better than today's chases. In the forties if a policeman saw a car driving away from somewhere, he could just shoot at it or shoot out the tires so it would crash into a taxidermy shop. Today they don't shoot at big crowds of people. Everyone in this movie has a gun.All the sets are fun to imagine as being real. The hospital, the chemist's lab, the conveyor belt. The cars were beautiful back in the '30s and '40s. There is a lot to enjoy here. I saw this when I was a kid of about 8. It was great then, it is fun today.Now get that cat out of the bank.Tom Willett</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>'No useless killings!'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Boris Karloff as Gruesome adds a genuine feeling of menace to this addition of Dick Tracy potboilers. I liked the way his character refers to a henchman killing a cop as a 'useless killing'. Unlike the 'worthwhile killings' he employs when he decides to get rid of the people who stand in his way. A superb example of twisted criminal logic!Once again, the character of Dick Tracy is dull and goes through the motions but gets his man in the end anyway. A disappointment is that Gruesome doesn't meet his fate in a more exciting and...well...gruesome fashion in keeping with the style of this series of films. Especially as Gruesome cold bloodliy shoots and kills a woman to stop her squealing to the cops! For just over a hour, these short films deliver some fast entertainment, there's flaws in the plots, the budgets are low but they are fun. And that's fair enough for me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>best of the Dick Tracy series</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Dick Tracy Meets Gruesome" was the last of the Dick Tracy films, but the series ends on a high note, with Boris Karloff as Gruesome, and he's true to his name. It's not clear why this series didn't continue.The premise is a funny one - bank robbers use this freezing spray to stop people mid-sentence and mid-movement. Tess Truheart (Anne Gwynne) is in a phone booth when the robbers spray, so she's able to crawl to a telephone and call Dick. Gruesome is the head honcho, but he's not going to be easy to catch.The characters in the film all have the grotesque look of the comic strip characters and the same crazy names, I.M. Learned, A. Tomic (physicist) etc. Gwynne is more like Anne Jeffreys was - beautiful and street smart, more of a leading woman than the ingénue cast in another of the films. I think that characterization of Tess as good-looking and sharp works better for the character than a sweet girl next door type.This Dick Tracy was more expensive the others and stars the preferred Tracy, Ralph Byrd, who also did the Dick Tracy TV series.Enjoyable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Delivers the entertainment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first saw this movie on late-night TV in the 1970s, and have seen it a few more times since. It has held up very well, except for the bank robbery scene, which really does get annoying on repeated viewings.The very effective opening sequence introduces us to the menacing Gruesome (Karloff), his partner in crime Melody, and creepy new associate X-Ray (Skelton Knaggs). Gruesome collapses after inhaling some experimental gas and ends up in the morgue. He awakens and lights a cigarette; Pat Patton, at this desk nearby, notices something in the air but goes back to his writing, and is soon knocked cold by Gruesome, who makes his escape. There's a deft mixture of suspense and comedy in this scene, capped by Patton's line to Tracy, "If I didn't know better I'd swear we were doing business with Boris Karloff!" By contrast, the bank robbery looks like a 50s sitcom, as the release of paralyzing gas causes everybody on the premises to freeze-frame in a cartoony manner. It's easy to understand why the scene was handled this way; a more realistic treatment that showed the bank customers clutching their throats and writhing as they crumbled to the floor might have been deemed too grim. But I wish this scene hadn't been played entirely as a joke, because it dispels the dark mood established by what went before. Most viewers probably don't consider the talky scene in which Tracy meets Professor I.M. Learned to be a highlight, but it's one of my favorite parts. I can't tell if June Clayworth (who plays Learned) was much of an actress, but she is just right as the mousy scholar who might or might not be trustworthy. Learned's confrontation with Tracy is alive with ambiguity, and fun to watch. There are many nice touches. Gruesome always has a toothpick in his mouth, and it shifts like the darting tongue of a reptile. When Gruesome and X-Ray bluff their way into a hospital by impersonating doctors, a desk guard asks Gruesome if he knows how to work the elevator. "Like the fingers on my hand", Gruesome replies, making a trigger-finger gesture.Strong cast, brisk pace, and nice visual style lift this movie a cut above the average programmer.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A gang of criminals, which includes a piano player and an imposing former convict known as 'Gruesome', has found out about a scientist's secret formula for a gas that temporarily paralyzes anyone who breathes it. When Gruesome accidentally inhales some of the gas and passes out, the police think he is dead and take him to the morgue, where he later revives and escapes. This puzzling incident attracts the interest of Dick Tracy, and when the criminals later use the gas to rob a bank, Tracy realizes that he must devote his entire attention to stopping them. Never saw a Dick Tracy movie before and wow.This one with Boris Karloff is just amazing.Very tight and well directed.But it's Karloff who makes the film.

		<shortDescription>Dick Tracy vs Boris Karloff</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the fourth and final of the RKO Dick Tracy films. It's also the best. Why is it the best? Well, look no further than the cast. Horror great Boris Karloff plays the villain Gruesome. Karloff could do no wrong and he elevates this whole picture. The plot involves a paralyzing nerve gas and a bank robbery. Skelton Knaggs is also in this as Gruesome's cohort in crime, X-Ray. More characters with fun names like a piano player named Melody and several doctors (Dr. L.E. Thal, Dr. A. Tomic, Dr. I.M. Learned). These movies weren't "A" productions. They were turned out quickly and cheaply. But still, they are fun, fast-paced detective stories with mystery, action, and humor. This one, like I said, is the best of the lot. Karloff fans will love it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I tuned into this movie expecting a very badly done work, but I was pleasantly surprised. The first half hour is a real kick with more laughs than suspense. The remainder of the movie is more akin to what I expected. Boris Karloff was wonderful as "Gruesome" and kept the second half moving. I have to say that some of those guys were incredible shots with a tire shot out with one shot at about 100 yards and police officer killed "instantly" with a quick shot from a getaway car. Like the movie, the marksmanship declined markedly as the movie progressed. All in all, I recommend you watch it if you enjoy the old "B" movies. I plan to look for more in this series and see how they stack up.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dick Tracy and his exploits step into the world of science fiction Ralph Byrd as animation's favorite square jawed police detective gets involved with none other than Boris Karloff as Gruesome in Dick Tracy Meets Gruesome.Usually Boris Karloff is the mad scientist concocting such things as a paralysis nerve gas which leaves folks paralyzed so that others think they could be dead. But here he's a ruthless career criminal who gets a dose of the stuff outside a waterfront dive and appear so dead that he's brought to the morgue by Lyle Latell as Tracy's sidekick Pat Patton. When he gets up and walks out of the morgue making Latell the victim of a horse laugh that's only the beginning.Karloff realizes the possibilities as does the inventor of the paralysis gas for criminal enterprise and he uses it in several bank jobs. But it was his hard luck to have Tess Trueheart in the bank on the first job and in a telephone booth so that the paralysis wouldn't effect her. She recognizes the robbers and Karloff as Gruesome is not hard to miss. Hell Boris Karloff isn't hard to miss. Tess played by B movie queen Anne Gwynne.Byrd is put in some real harm's way in the final confrontation with Karloff. Gruesome is pretty ruthless in eliminating witnesses and Byrd is almost caught in the trap he set for him.Boris Karloff as Gruesome lifts Dick Tracy Meets Gruesome a notch over a lot of B films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>**SPOILERS** Having escaped from the joint Gruesome, Boris Karloff, meets his contact outside of prison Melody Fiske, Tony Barrett, at the seedy Hangman's Knot Bar to reactivate his criminal career that a stint in jail put on hold.It's almost by accident that Gruesome found out about Melody's partner in crime Dr. Lee Thal's, Edward Ashley, secret formula in freezing in place people for as much as 15 minutes. It's that formula, converted into a freeze bomb, that Gruesome uses the next day to rob the National Bank of some $200,000.00. This has Dick Tracy, Ralph Byrd, get on Gruesome's tail in that his girlfriend Tess Trueheart, Anne Gwynne, was the only witness by having herself locked in a phone booth, which made her immune to the freeze bomb, while the robbery was in progress.Tracy in trying to keep the lid on the Gruesome Gang robbery in order to put a stop to a run on the city banks has to put Gruesome and his gang out of commission before the pesky reporter Dan Sterne, Jim Noland, has the story of the freeze bomb printed in his newspaper. This has Tracy put his life on the line in working against the clock to apprehend Gruesome before he pulls off his next bank robbery using his mind as well as body numbing freeze bomb. Tracy goes so far in his trying to get Gruesome that he impersonates Melody who had since died in a car accident while being chased by the police. Something that will expose Tracy to the frightening freeze bomb twice not once in the movie. Not to mention the dangerous Gruesome himself who would like nothing better then to put Tracy out of action and out of his hair forever. We have in the movie's cast of characters Tracy's bumbling assistant plainclothesman Pat Patton, Lyle Latell, who's anything like his "Blood &amp; Guts" namesake-Gen George Patton-in getting the job done. There's also in the cast nuclear physicist Dr. A.Tomic, Milton Parsons, whom we can assume the A-Bomb was named after together with Dr. Lee Thal skeletal-like skin and bones assistant X-Ray played by the apply named actor Skelton Knaggs! The last of the Dick Tracy movie series staring Ralph Byrd who three years later returned to play the famous comic-strip detective on TV only to die from a sudden heart-attack at age 43 on August 18, 1952 before the start of the series third season.</fullReview>

The real attraction was Boris Karloff playing a toothpick-chomping hood! I wasn't expecting that, but it was totally worth the price of admission! :-D Had no idea he was as agile as he was, especially when you see him plodding through monster pictures. The scene in the morgue, the character names (Drs A. Tomic, L. E Thal and I. M. Learned), the punnery, and the action made it a nice 60-odd minute romp.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Boris Karloff robs a bank and steal the show</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When the eponymous Gruesome gets out of the slammer he meets up with fellow criminal and part time pianist 'Melody'. Melody explains that he has an idea for a job that will involve scientist Dr A. Tomic; Gruesome goes to meet the man but while snooping around his office he opens a container which releases a gas. He staggers out and it looks like he has died. He isn't dead though and wakes up in the police morgue! He escapes and comes up with a plan; he and his gang will use a refined form of the gas to rob a bank. When released the gas freezes everybody where they stand; the only witness is Dick Tracy's girlfriend who was in a phone box at the time. As the gang flee Melody shoots a policeman and soon Dick Tracy and the homicide squad are on their trail.This story is was rather fun if more than a little preposterous; not only does the gas instantly freeze people it also seems to negate the laws of physics concerning the conservation of momentum? moving people do not fall over and when they wake they move as if nothing has happened. This doesn't really matter as it isn't meant to be taken seriously. The names of the bad guys adds to the fun, not only do we have Gruesome and A. Tomic; there is also X-Ray, Dr. L. E. Thal and Dr Learned! The action is fun with Tracy getting into danger more than once? although nobody will doubt he will prevail; the only question is how he will do so and what will happen to the various bad guys. Ralph Byrd does a solid job as Dick Tracy but it is Boris Karloff who steals the show with his performance as Gruesome; playing the role straight rather than overplaying the part. Overall a fun way to pass an hour.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a surprisingly good effort in an otherwise routine series of second-billed features. The other entries in the Dick Tracy series are cartoonish and juvenile, but this one has a plot, good production values and better than competent acting. Hiring Boris Karloff was inspired casting as he adds immeasurable status to the film with his vivid portrayal of Gruesome.The most striking aspect of the production was the unusually absorbing screenplay of the type not often seen in a programmer - just swallow a bit and go with it, and it works. Last but not least, you can get a look at one of Hollywood's best looking females in Anne Gwynne. Not for nothing was she a WWII pin-up girl.If you come across this picture in your DVD set, don't skip it. It's worth watching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm fantasizing what I could do with the stop-action chemical compound that the bank robbers use in this film, the best of the Tracy's. It's a neat plot device, novel for the time, and a very well done special effect. I hope the actors were paid double for having to hold pose when freeze-frame wouldn't do. And catch Karloff as Gruesome. Make-up didn't even have to spend much money to create a grotesque effect? the actor's craggy features were already half-way there (I gather that in real life, he was a gentle, very nice man). Under- rated director John Rawlins adds some effective touches, such as the got'cha in the taxidermy shop, and and manages to keep things moving at an entertaining pace. And watch for that surprise on the conveyor belt at movie's end? I expect that was to spare kids in the audience. Also, it's a clever script with a few surprises, along with the usual tongue-in-cheek names, like Y. Stuffum (the taxidermist) and I. M. Learned ( the professor)! And, of course, no Tracy is complete without those two real-life weirdo's, Skelton Knaggs (X-ray) in coke-bottle glasses and grave-yard Milton Parsons (A. Tomic) as the invention genius. Good thing there's the fetching Anne Gwynn as Tess Trueheart to give the eyes a rest. Ralph Byrd is the definitive Tracy and, what's more, appears to be enjoying the part. In fact, it looks like RKO put more money (hiring Karloff) and effort into this production than in the others. So, I'm sort of surprised the series was discontinued. Were the box-office results disappointing?? maybe an executive power play? Too bad, because the comic strip was never more popular than during those postwar years. Anyway, this is the best of the entries and still holds together nicely as an example of the movie-making craft.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A 'War on Small Investors' ?!?!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a fast-moving B-movie with no pretensions and a running time of 1 hour and a little change. Ralph Byrd does his good old dependable Dick Tracy, which is a darn sight better than the Warren Beatty version, and Anne Gywnne is a sexy and spunky Tess Trueheart, but the villains are the real show. The guy playing X-ray is really creepy and looks like a true degenerate, and Boris Karloff does an expert turn playing a sociopath. This villain is a little more subtle than your typical Karloff character, and if you watch him, you really can see what a pro the guy was, how deftly he could go from mood to mood, making it look easy.The strange names of the characters and the freezing gas are the tribute this film pays to its comic strip origins, but there is also a strong noir influence, which makes perfect sense, being as this flick was made at the height of the film noir period. The Karloff character, Gruesome, is a classic film noir sociopath. Too bad Karloff didn't more gangster roles; it might have been a second career for him.An interesting note: the villains' plot involves paralyzing bank employees and customers while they loot the joint. One of our heroes proclaims that this scheme has the potential of completely devastating confidence in the banking system and could cause a run on the banks, a 1930's type bank panic. Thus the villains' plot is called a "war on small investors." Writing this review in November, 2008, about 1 month after Congress gave over $700 billion to a banking industry that squandered the nation's money, I am tempted to draw some kind of analogy or make an ironical statement. But for some reason, it seems unnecessary.The only real flaw in this movie is the seemingly obligatory corny joke at the end, which clashes badly with the overall tone of the movie, and is pretty lame in its own right. That said, the otherwise excellent execution of this vehicle and my fondness for a Hollywood that made comic strip adaptations that were neither campy nor bloated, overdone pieces of self-indulgent narcissism, leaves me inclined to forgive the director.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First lets get this out of the way, Boris Karloff is amazing. Karloff brings serious gravitas for a character in a film such as this. Beyond Karloff, however, the acting is quite suspect. Byrd and Gwynne aren't nearly as compelling as Conway and Jeffreys of the 1945 film.On the story front, there is much more cartoon atmosphere present compared with the 1945 film. The names of persons and places are all gags, hand-canons are constantly going off at seeming random and Tracy's partner bumbles like no other. Whilst this is fun it isn't done well at all. The film still plays to close to 'real'. Overall this creates a strange unbalanced experience.**Spoiler**The entire device to get Tracy to the lair of Gruesome (his body switch for Melody) is ridiculous. If all Gruesome wished was to kill Melody, he wouldn't have stolen and burned him. It would have been much simpler to shoot or knife him in the hospital thus avoiding stealing an ambulance &amp;c.**Spoiler Over**Overall, the film is enjoyable and worth a watch. It's flawed and questionable, but Karloff and occasional gags pull it together to create something a notch above average.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>KARLOFF IS REALLY GRUESOME!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yes, this was a B picture in the late 40's and actors still had to make a living and (Boris Karloff) as Gruesome was the best selection by director John Rawlins. It seems a mysterious gas which temporarily paralyzes people falls into the possession of a disreputable doctor, L.E. Thal(Edward Ashley). Realizing the great criminal opportunities of the strange gas, Gruesome, an ex-convict, enlists Thal's aid in a bank robbery. "Dick Tracy Meets Gruesome" is a thriller-diller only because Boris Karloff is the star performer. The picture has Karloff putting his victims in a huge furnace for safekeeping. Chester Gould, the creator of the comic-strip was proud of this picture in 1947.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It has the right idea of a comic strip carefully made into a movie, managing to be thorough, smooth and playful. And Karloff does bring something, that dark glamour and the quiet excitement, and that eerie charm, he recapitulates his previous career on the screen, and has the authority given by his experience; this player would of been great in gangster movies. The Tracy movies are neat and very enjoyable. In this one, you'll see an intriguing character actor playing X-ray, a henchman. Also, an actress offering a nice role as the missing scientist's assistant.In this movie franchise, the villains have been given pride of place; Tracy is a pawn in a teamwork, occasionally outsmarted by sly interlopes, and it needed a serviceable player, the choice for this movie was a fairly likable lead who gives a decent performance, just as required by the movie, he doesn't come across as bland (or, worse, ? 'less engaging' ?), but as stylized according to the franchise. The movies themselves have the look of adult comic strips, the wrongdoers are frightening, the action is thorough.The still frames of freezing transfixed characters have a suggestion: they resemble the comic strip panels. The _transfixion given by the gas bombs serves as a sign of the comic panel's idea.The villain who, forced to change sides within the underworld, becomes Karloff's sidekick, X-ray, was a striking character actor.There are in-jokes, I liked Karloff's rise after he recovered from the _transfixion given by the freezing gas-bomb, the allusion to body-snatching.The _cityscapes look great.It's RKO, who did awesome job, as here in conveying the feel of the comics, the movies really are for the comic strips' buffs. A nice role from the lady playing A. Tomic's assistant, a wonderful scene at the taxidermist, and a refreshing sidelining of the reporter.Tracy was a physical role, as generic as it gets, the generic copper, and the leading actor was serviceable.This series deserves being legendary.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dick Tracy Meets Gruesome</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After a good trio of RKO Val Lewton pictures, Karloff's career would kind of slide into less prestige B-movies and television. Here in "Dick Tracy Meets Gruesome", Karloff returns to the kind of heavies notable during his Warner Bros. or Universal Studios periods. He stars as a recently released crook who just so happens to literally stumble into a scientist's new experiment which renders humans "frozen" and helpless, with no movement. This new invention allows Karloff's Gruesome to initiate a series of bank robberies, using the chemical gas to subdue the clerks, security guards, bank employees, and clients in place mid movement while he and his associates rob joints in the city. Enter Dick Tracy (Ralph Byrd), on the case to help the police catch Gruesome and his gang, during his investigation the detective is led to a scientist named Dr. A. Tomic (Milton Parsons), which eventually puts him in the crosshairs of Gruesome. The movie includes Skelton Knaggs in goggle-eyed glasses assisting Karloff in an attempted capture of a comatose patient by disguising themselves as paramedics, Karloff shooting a potential female informant in cold blood as she walks down a quiet, empty street from the driver's seat of his car, Karloff and Tracy in a protracted shootout, Karloff collapsing in a street after stumbling upon the gas resulting in finding himself in a morgue (!), and Anne Gwyne (House of Frankenstein; she stars as Tracy's love interest) the only awake witness to an ongoing bank heist while everyone else is frozen by the gas. Dialogue heavy for sure, and the gas' effects are rather cheesy. Karloff handles the dastardly persona with kid gloves, bossing around those involved in his criminal activities, orchestrating the robberies and capable of the most heinous of acts if it means protecting himself from another trip to the slammer. Byrd is totally outshone by Karloff, and the less of him the better (which is kind of sad considering the movie is supposed to be his starring vehicle). Knaggs' soft voice and creepy eyes in those glasses (and diminutive size) is rather quite a contrast to Karloff's brutish antagonist. The cops are spinning their wheels for much of the running time, as the villains stay ahead of them. A set up in the hospital is what leads to Tracy getting the upper hand on the crooks. RKO seems to be imitating something you'd see from Warners in the 30s during the Cagney/Robinson/Bogie period of gangster shootouts?Karloff certainly wields a mean pistol. Another menace to add to Karloff's rogues gallery... The movie plays up an against-the-clock rush-time due to a pushy reporter who happens upon details of the case while Tracy and the cops are discussing everything at the station. As there is no honor among crooks, Karloff's team decide to try and turn on him, which is a big no-no.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There's more wordplay than usual in the final entry in the Series. For better or worse we are given Names that evoke chuckles and sighs. But the Characters personified are more of that specialized Tracy Comic-Strip charm.Boris Karloff is decidedly "Gruesome", carries the show and steals every Scene He appears. Although Skelton Knaggs as "X-Ray" can't be ignored with a sinister voice and coke-bottle glasses. Ralph Byrd as Tracy pretty much just reacts to things happening around. He is straight laced and squared jawed dutiful.The other returning characters show up and go through Their standard routines. Not as good as the first one in the Series but it is an above average B-Movie thanks to Karloff and a clever gimmick. Fast paced and fun.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the best of the Dick Tracey movies I have seen, where he meets the great Boris Karloff.In this one, Tracey is assigned to investigate a series of robberies where the robbers use a nerve gas to "freeze" everybody while they pinch the stuff. We see this happen during a bank robbery but a woman in a phone booth witnesses every move of this and calls the police. Tracy's investigation leads him to the gang leader, Gruesome (Karloff) and the lab where the gas is made.Joing Boris in the cast are Ralph Bryd as Dick Tracy and Anne Gwynne as his wife.Watch this one if you get the chance, worth seeing just for Boris alone.Rating: 3 stars out of 5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dick Tracy Meets Gruesome is worthy final series entry</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have long been familiar with Dick Tracy through first his comic strip when I was a kid in the '70s, then an Archie series that showcased animated comic strips, then an early '60s cartoon series from UPA, then Warren Beaty's 1990 movie and now from the last of four RKO Tracy movies from the '40s. As he had in some late '30s Republic serials and the previous RKO entry, Ralph Byrd plays the title character whose nemesis here is the other title character played by the legendary Boris Karloff. It involves a gas that paralyzes people for several minutes that makes it easy for Karloff and his cohorts to come in an rob a bank. Also in the bank is Tess Truehart (Anne Gwynne) who happens to be in a phone booth when the gas goes off so she isn't affected and calls boyfriend Tracy as the robbery takes place. Nicely dramatic and comedic use of freeze-frame throughout with subsequent action sequences an added bonus. Very good performances from Karloff and his cohorts Skelton Knaggs as X-Ray and Tony Barrett as Melody. The good guys aren't so bad either! I liked Pat's line about doing business with Boris Karloff the best. Well worth seeing for fans of '40s series programmers. P.S. Jason Robards, Sr. plays the bank vice president here.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Cut Above the Rest</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In this episode, Tracy is more formidable. He is less smitten with Tess and so he is really on the case (she barely matters in the plot). Karloff's bad guy is a sociopath. You need to believe that it is possible to create a gas that will not only paralyze people, but defy the laws of gravity. Once you can get past that little stumbling block, it's fun to watch the plot unfold. Some of the acting is pretty bad, but it is played for comic effect anyway. Karloff is a monster with no feelings. He is surrounded by lackeys but has no trouble killing them at his whim. He is totally driven by crime and self gratification, but seems to have no humor to him at all. He is almost beast-like. The plot to capture him which plays by the rules isn't too bad. There's this furnace and an elevator that brings wood to it that plays a key role in things. Dick risks his life, of course. That stuff is pretty potent. One of the female character is done in in a drive by shooting. I wonder if this was pre-code. It's pretty brutal for the time. My favorite scenes are when you get to watch Gruesome's henchmen realizing that this guy is a fruitcake and needs to be gotten rid of.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Gruesome" doesn't work as well as some of the other Tracy's, I think the very presence of Karloff means that at times it gets reduced to semi-comic camp melodrama. OK in Walter Mitty et al but not really desirable in a 65 minute formulaic B film of this kind.However, getting into the ambiance I warmed to the premise of body-clock-stopping bank robbers, the freeze frames generally working on both dramatic and comic levels. Karloff distances himself from the baddies' "brutality" by telling his henchman that he was foolish in shooting dead the bank cop, but doesn't mind killing his friends in general. What happened to Knaggs - did he survive?Anne Gwynne drapes herself about well, Byrd seems a bit cold towards her proving he either needed his eyes testing or as he was hatless for long stretches maybe he couldn't function properly!An interesting little potboiler with a nice end.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sporting one of the greatest faces in the history of cinema (not to mention one of the most distinctive and recognizable voices), William Pratt ("Boris Karloff") might very well have stepped full-blown from one of the Chester Gould DICK TRACY strips. Unlike the lousy (not to mention oh-so-expensive) Big Screen fiasco with Warren Beatty in the title role, DICK TRACY MEET GRUESOME is at least watchable- and Boris himself is the reason; had they thrown in the likes of, say, Rondo Hatten and/or Peter Lorre to further the Gould visual style, and had they gotten an actor of at least marginal charisma to play the lead, this one could've been one for the ages: it's not badly directed and the cinematography is appropriately low key. Its greatest fault lies in the WRITING; a familiar refrain, to be sure, but it's the reason this one isn't worth more than a single look.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amusing Entry In the 1940s RKO Film Series</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Originated by Chester Gould's syndicated comic strip, Dick Tracy has been a durable cinematic character with appearances ranging from 1930s serials to an over-hyped 1990 blockbuster-style motion picture starring Warren Beatty and Madonna--but the character's film appearances are perhaps most fondly recalled from the 1940s RKO Pictures series. Written with stacco dialogue and seldom running more than an hour, they were welcome "B" movies at almost every matinée.The 1947 DICK TRACY MEETS GRUESOME is very typical of the series in terms of style, plot, and Ralph Byrd, who frequently played the character; it is atypical in the sense that it also features a major star, none other than Boris Karloff, who appears as Gruesome. In this particular tale, the criminal Gruesome is taken to meet a mysterious professor--and through him stumbles onto a chemical that makes people freeze in their tracks for several minutes. It's an ideal weapon for a bank heist, but Gruesome runs afoul of Tess Trueheart (Anne Gwynne, popular WWII pin-up and "B" actress in such titles as FLASH GORDON CONQUERS THE UNIVERSE and HOUSE OF FRANKENSTEIN), who is on the scene and unaffected. Tess manages to alert Tracy and the manhunt is soon underway.The film makes use of cartoonist Gould's knack for odd names--on this occasion including Dr. A. Tomic--and shoot-'em-up action, and Karloff scores a particularly menacing turn with, of all things, a furnace. No one would accuse it of being high-end or particularly inventive, but it is a fun little flick of its time; while casual viewers will find it very slight, Tracy fans will have fun.GFT, Amazon Reviewer</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The last of the RKO series starring RALPH BYRD, it has him hunting down Gruesome (BORIS KARLOFF) after a bank robbery in which a gas freezes the bank's customers and clerks in mid-position while the robbery takes place. It's a novel idea and nicely staged, as ANNE GWYNNE (who plays Tess Trueheart) enters an enclosed telephone booth and sees the action take place while she eludes the gas herself.Too bad the rest of the story doesn't match this early scene for a hint of originality. It's a rather pedestrian story that has KARLOFF putting down anyone that gets in his way.If you pay attention, you can catch an early glimpse of LEX BARKER, soon to be the studio's Tarzan, playing an ambulance driver who is on to Karloff and gets bopped on the head while Karloff and his pals make a quick getaway.It's cast with the usual assortment of unusual characters, but doesn't quite live up to its promise despite the presence of BORIS KARLOFF. Byrd at least gets a little more to do than usual, but the final confrontation could have been stronger.</fullReview>

This one has one of the more interesting ideas behind it.Oh, the movie itself is as dull as a soft brick. A newspaper rat threatens to report on the problem, throwing people into a panic and causing a run on the banks... unless Tracy comes through in a few hours.But the idea is sweet.The bad guy here is played by Boris Karloff. In the first few minutes, there is a joke about the strangeness being like dealing with Boris Karloff. He plays a guy who apparently dies and then comes to life. He coopts a good-hearted but twisted scientist who has created a seemingly magical formula. The formula causes people to freeze (while banks are robbed) , allowing for an inexpensive cinematic effect.The bad guy's sidekick is x-ray. Tracy's final ruse has him bandaged up like the mummy. The film itself is a bore. But you can imagine the glee in the home of the writer, when he put this together. Writers. Love em.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements.</fullReview>

Tracy and his pal whip out those .38's and fire, no matter what the surroundings, and for little reason. He breaks into a professor's house and searches it, all without benefit of a warrant. There are dozens of other things that real cops wouldn't get away with today -- and I don't think they did back then, either!But as long as you're not expecting "Gone With The Wind," it's good for a bit of fun.</fullReview>

As usual, Tracy is basically a jerk, mistreating his fiancée and foster son Junior by frequently running out on them and making them wait for him, as if no one else in the city can work a murder.The plot is the usual collection of scientists and thugs on a crime spree, with double-crosses among the bad guys. Gruesome gives him a run for his money, outwitting Tracy's detectives, using the amazing freeze gas, and just killing whoever gets in his way. The support is largely the same faces as in other Dick Tracy flicks, altho some play different characters.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A new Dick Tracy along with horrible writing spells a definite downturn for the series.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Compared to the next Tracy film (DICK TRACY'S DILEMMA), this is a pretty good film. This isn't saying a lot, considering how horrible the next movie is however. The main problem with both these films were the moronic writing--they just didn't make any attempt to fix plot holes or make the movies make any sense--even within the oddly surreal Dick Tracy world. Also, many of the actors really are about as exciting to watch as a pile of wood shavings--with hardly any discernible personality. The first two films of the RKO series (DICK TRACY DETECTIVE and DICK TRACY VS. CUEBALL) were much better films as the writing was very good.The biggest plus of this film is having Boris Karloff as the title character and villain. Believe it or not, he plays the role pretty straight and he's pretty good that way. The problem is that he just doesn't get all that much support from the other actors.The biggest negative was the writing, though in some ways it was still pretty good. The overall plot of the sleeping gas is exactly like the sort of plot you might find in an old Dick Tracy cartoon. However, the film also suffers from so many logical errors that just look sloppy. For example, Tracy pretends to be a wounded bad guy and Gruesome kidnaps him so he can murder him! Why didn't he just strangle the guy in the hospital bed or shoot him--why go to all the trouble of sneaking him out of the hospital just to kill him?! Plus, if you are Tracy, don't you think you would be sure you have backup at this time so you aren't killed?! Nope--this would have mean spending a few extra moments editing or even reading the script before filming!! This film is for lovers of B-detective films only. All others, you'll find the film cheap and dull.FYI--In DICK TRACY'S DILEMMA (also starring Ralph Byrd), I said in my review that Tracy had all the charisma of a piece of lint. Here in this film he is much more active but also much, much stupider. When he meets with Dr. A. Tomic's assistant, she shows him around his lab. When Tracy sees an unmarked bottle among the many dangerous chemicals, he asks the lady what it is. She says she doesn't know and thinks it MIGHT be harmless. So what does Tracy do? Yep, he tastes the liquid to see what it might be!!! You lose a lot of cops that way! Yep, he is a really big idiot in this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Boris Karloff as the character Gruesome has the perfect face "sourpuss" for the role. He even played a dead man who comes "back to life" in the police morgue. Karloff inhaled some experimental gas that caused his body to be declared dead. A certain physicist named A. Tomic has completed the experimental gas and developed a gas that renders any breathing creature of the gas "frozen" for about 12 minutes before coming out of this state without any knowledge of it. Gruesome is able to rob a bank because of this process. This plot was something that I saw on a "Twilight Zone" involving a stopwatch that stops time thereby allowing the wearer to rob a bank. This film had too many elements of a comic strip such as the plot and the names like "X-ray, A. Tomic, Gruesome and Dr. I. M. Learned" to be taken seriously. This film was more in a vain of comedy at times than a drama.</fullReview>
