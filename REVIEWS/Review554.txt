		<shortDescription>Nate Parker's Ambitious Debut Chained to Conventionality</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Freshman Director Nate Parker creates a picture that is seemingly inspired by Best Picture winners such as Braveheart, Schindlers List and 12 Years of Slave, but produces a conventionally formulaic film lacking aesthetic cohesion, pacing, and&nbsp;subtlety. The Birth of a Nation (2016) isn't a remake or reboot of D.W. Griffith's controversial and widely regarded groundbreaking masterpiece, but is instead Nate Parker's seemingly ambitious directorial debut-- a true story revenge tale about Nate Turner, an African American slave, referred to as "Prophet" by his followers, who led a Slave rebellion comprised of slaves and free blacks in Virginia in 1831, approximately 33 years before the Congressional passage of the 13th amendment and abolishment of slavery in all States. After a series of religious visions and certain atmospheric conditions, Nate Turner believed he was tasked by God to begin an uprising, his goal was to awaken the attitudes of whites to the reality of the inherent brutality in slave-holding and to spread terror and alarm amongst whites-- the rebellion did not discriminate by age or sex, until it was determined that the rebellion had achieved sufficient numbers. Turner certainly accomplished that, but one could say in vain. The rebellion left around 60 dead white's- including many defenseless women and children-- and resulted in the state executing 56 blacks suspected of having been involved in the uprising. And unfortunately in the hysteria of aroused fears and anger in the days after the revolt, white militias and mobs killed an estimated 200 blacks, many of whom had nothing to do with the rebellion.The fear caused by Nat Turner's insurrection and the concerns raised in the emancipation debates that followed resulted in politicians and writers responding by defining slavery as a "positive good". Across Virginia and other southern states, state legislators passed new laws to control slaves and free blacks. They prohibited education of slaves and free blacks, restricted the rights of assembly for free blacks, withdrew their right to bear arms and voting, and required white ministers to be present at all black worship services. So one could definitely say the revolt was ultimately an utter failure. The story about Nate Turner has been something of a passion project for Freshman director Nate Parker, who-- for all intents and purposes-- had full creative authority on this production as the writer, director, producer and lead actor. In what is the most violent slave revolt in U.S history it definitely is a story worth telling on screen, but one better told accurately; and as far as violence is concerned Parker delivers a solid account in its depiction. But Parker certainly cherry picks his character development aspects and plays down Nate Turner's religious zeal and tries to show the rebellion as a success and skips showing us the post revolt brutality instead strangely delegating that duty to the end credits. The washed out aesthetic to the cinematography looks cheap, and is accompanied by a soaring score that oftentimes is overbearing. Despite the beautiful Georgia landscapes and a few great shots, Elliot Davis mostly delivers conventional cinematography, instead of showing the dramatic material in a visually arresting way, wasting great opportunities to be a character in and of itself. The dialogue is a bit cheesy and unconvincing. This includes a routine sentimentalism that keeps the movie grounded in a series of conventional beats. Turner's stump speech feels especially heavy-handed.The weakest aspect is the pacing. Unfortunately there's a conventionality to the somewhat mediocre and predictable storytelling that remains monotonous throughout. Parker plays it a bit too safe, and wastes many opportunities to build narrative momentum.Aside from Nate Turner the characters just feel a bit thin and underdeveloped and to some extent unbelievable. Parker fails to sell us on Turner's visions. The best aspect of this film is Nate Parker's solid performance but the rest of the cast delivers unmemorable performances with most filling stock roles. All in all the delivery of the film seems a bit too heavy handed to seriously be considered a great film. It's like The Patriot or The Alamo more than Braveheart or Schindler's list in that sense. Nate Parker takes a great story but fails to deliver a memorable picture by using conventional storytelling methods in a bid to drive home an agenda that'll launch a debate instead of delivering a masterpiece to be remembered for decades. This film could have really been something amazing had a better filmmaker (less afraid to take risks) taken the reigns.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film that wallows in the shadow of it's story and never really escapes it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nate Parker's stirring portrayal of Nat Turner's rebellion is a film that tries extremely hard to be something more than what it is. This is not the Oscar contender you read it to be, this is not some revelation in the vein of Roots, this is just another slavery film. Nate Parker's film sheds no new light on the brutality of slavery and does his absolute best to make sure you despise the white villains in this as anyone should as they are portrayed with much relish from the actors especially Jackie Earle Haley's menacing slave owner that serves as the main villain of the film. The problems that The Birth of a Nation has are ones that exist in it's director's overbearing ego and overwhelming goal to bring something powerful to the table. Parker succeeds haphazardly unfortunately. The Birth of a Nation tells the story of Nat Turner, a preacher turned rebellion leader as he fights racism in the deep south with a violent and brutal fist. The film is powerful and Jackie Earle Haley and Gabrielle Union are absolute gems in this film, with Union giving the best performance of her career and Nate Parker giving...well, a performance. The problems here lie with the film itself. The story plays like a more realistic version of Django Unchained, even lifting some inspiration from that film a little too heavily for the scenes in which the slaves are beaten and abused. The other film that Parker must have had playing on his tablet while directing some scenes is Braveheart because, the last battle in particular, is riddled with countless homages to that film that border plagiarism. However, this does stand as Nate Parker's first directorial effort and, for a first film, it is a damn fine effort that should lead to more work as a director. Despite this fact, it still is nowhere near enough to sustain this as a film worthy of accolades and praise. Quite frankly, there is a lot wrong with the film. The pacing is either mind-numbingly slow or so quickly cut and erratic that you can barely grasp what is going on. There is no in between. The story is bland and has been done before and done better despite this being Nat Turner's first on-screen portrayal, the story has inspired many films that have come out in recent years such as the previously mentioned Django Unchained. The sound design, at least on the Sundance version that I saw, was very flat and felt a bit too post-production sounding. Despite all this, I can't fully write this film off. There are some truly powerful performances in the film and some well done battle sequences to enjoy but other than that, this is an average film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Less About History and More About Promoting Race War</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The main problem with this film about Nat Turner is that it presents an uncritical, and one-sided view of Nat Turner as being a hero. A man who cold bloodedly and intentionally murdered women and children can never be considered a hero in my book, regardless of their cause. If he had just killed his plantation master and escaped to freedom, my opinion would be far different.But the real problem with this film is the timing and the blatant propaganda message behind it. The message is that blacks should fight...but fight for what exactly? Institutionalized racism no longer exists. All the old racist law were struck down over five decades ago. Blacks in America today have unfair advantages in many sectors thanks to affirmative action policies, united negro scholarships, etc. A black student who applies to Harvard can be accepted with an SAT score 200 points lower than the score of the average white or Asian student. There are numerous other racial based advantages blacks enjoy thanks to their powerful lobbying groups like the NAACP and outspoken race zealots like Al Sharpton and Jesse Jackson.Oddly enough, black people today are no longer fighting for equality, they are simply fighting for superior advantages over all other racial groups. They want special benefits from the government, from universities, and from police departments. They will play the pervasive victim card to guilt shame anyone into giving them a special advantage or privilege that will serve their own interests. This continual "playing the victim" for special advantages will eventually backfire on the black community sooner or later.The laws 60 years ago were changed so everyone could be on an equal basis, at least legally speaking. Although everyone is individually dealt different cards in life, we should all be free to enter the workforce and prosper on a relatively equal footing, and no racial or ethnic group should get special advantages over any other.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lives up to the Original Film very well</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I find it very interesting that the original "Birth of Nation" which was incredibly racist and disgusting, that came out in..1915, was an epic of "white" racism. It was actually enjoyed by the previously most racist president of the 20th/21st century, Woodrow Wilson. Now 100 years later, walking in the footsteps of the incredibly violent and racist Hollywood trash "Django Unchained", we have this "remake". A remake which actually lives up to the original film with its racism, and promotion of racial divisiveness (after the original came out in 1915, the KKK which had been almost eradicated, went up to a mountain outside of Atlanta and had a bring cross burning which signified the return of the KKK in the 20th century), will more then likely have the same effect as the previous film.......and is accompanied by a President of the United states, very similar in his views of racial harmony as the one in office in 1915.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Movie with a Questionable Messege</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being a Sundance Movie, it being filmed in my state, and a directorial debut for Nate Parker made me very interested in this film. I had learned about Nat Turner's rebellion and was interested in how they would handle the morality of Turner when he turned to violence. But, instead the movie ultimately treats him as the greatest American hero who has ever lived. I love the idea of a slave revolting against his masters, but the emphasis is on "his masters". Not the women and children Nat Turner and his slave rebellion indiscriminately slaughtered. Today the message America needs to hear is not an eye for an eye. Other than it's message, this movie is a great directorial debut. The cinematography and imagery in this film are amazing. Acting is great. Overall it's a good movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The rebellion that was forgotten will now be remembered forever.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had the opportunity to watch this film at Sundance this year and after the screening Nate Parker gave a speech that I will never forget. I didn't learn about the Nat Turner Rebellion until I was in college and hearing that there was going to be a film was very exciting. I was 22 and learning about Nat Turner. 22 years on this earth without knowing about a man's ability to fight back for his life and the lives of everyone he knew. This movie is about standing up against what's wrong and through his incredible performance, Nate Parker tells that story with passion and determination. The film brought the realities of Nat Turner's life-time to life. You aren't watching a movie about Nat Turner, but rather, you are watching Nat Turner himself live the excruciating pain and tragedy of the south during the early 1800s. This movie represents our countries beginnings and the title is a reference to the infamous film made in 1915. 100 years later and we have made progress, but our country still has a long way to go. What I enjoyed most about this movie was the message that Nate Parker wants you to walk away with. During his speech after the screening he said, "This film tells the fatalist to sit down, and the optimist to stand up." For those of you that aren't aware, Fatalism is "the view that we are powerless to do anything other than what we actually do."So stop being the fatalist. Stand up and go make a change in this world.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An enthralling directorial debut</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nate parker writes, produces, acts, and directs this landmark in American history. The story of Nat Turner is one that is relatively uncharted territory in the realm of cinema, with that being said, Nate Parker does a great job of of telling the story, albeit a little shortsighted as to the backlash that transpired afterwards. Also, I don't know what this other critic user is talking about in regards to calling this movie, "racist crap" and giving it a 1 out of 10. The movie tells the story of a rebellious slave who does whatever he needs to, to achieve freedom from the oppressive south. With that being said, his story simply tells the truth of our nations racial relations at this time. In this particular context, Blacks and whites surely were not singing kumbaya, our relationship was highly one-sided, volatile, and largely disturbing. So, to anyone who is not prepared to see a small glimpse of historical truth in regards to our nations past, do not see this movie. You'll just end up like this other user, offended because this movie doesn't depict white people as saviors, heroes, etc, like most movies...it depicts a more sinister side that too often goes untold, unseen, and therefore, unnoticed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nat Turner</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Great film. Finally, a story of the slave who fought back. What is exceptionally great is that Nat Parker didn't tone down anything about the era or the obstacles thereof. American slavery was complex at best. Any type of slavery or oppression is complex. The characters were complex as was the main character. I quite enjoy Nat Parker and Armie Hammer on their own, but after this film - WOW. Powerful. It's not for the faint of heart or for those who want a "washed out" story. I've read a few of the comments here - and for those of you who understood context and the severity of the human condition for blacks during this time - it goes without saying that Nat Turner was well within his right to fight for his life (and therefore, the following paragraphs are not for you).For those of you who regard this film as "propaganda" or "racist crap", I am not surprised. Your real dismay is that the story is live for the entire world to see. Tough. If you push anyone too far - even a slave - then you get pushed back. Considering the treatment of blacks during that period, why would you dismiss his pain or that of any other "slave"? Naysayers of this film are idiots and quite comical. I gather that you'd prefer it when the racist whites - of that era and this - had the upper hand and everyone else cowered. Tough. Naysayers aren't upset with the film - they are upset with the truth. To that I say lastly - tough.Continuous and unsuccessful attempts to dismiss this film helps it gain momentum. Thanks! America's past produced this story - the man - the legend. When I watch stories of the native Indians - I see pain and I understand the uprisings. When I watched Braveheart - I understood their pain and their uprising - and I'd assume, naysayers, that I wouldn't be able to find your ignorant comments under Braveheart.If you'd dare to call the main character a "terrorist" - please let me stop laughing first. Aw, poor bullies (naysayers). You're not happy unless you're the bully. Bullies get theirs in the end though. Whites slave-masters killed and abused WAY more slaves than blacks (and that was before, during and after Nat Turner's insurrection). But, you knew that naysayers. So you can attempt to twist history all day long - God knows the truth. That's enough for me. Conclusion: See the film if you can handle the truth. If you can't... well... (doesn't change the truth).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There was a movie titled, "The Birth of a Nation" (originally called "The Clansman") which was a 1915 American silent epic drama film directed by D. W. Griffith and based on the novel and play "The Clansman". That movie was terribly racist and anti-Semitic of the Hebrew Israelite people. Blackface was in full effect. Nat Turner, a Hebrew Israelite, was a sign and used amazingly to show that the children of Israel are forever and ever the Creator's and He is theirs!I totally agree with the powerful statements of "Shali" and the statement by "Cinemacy" that says, "It's a brilliant way to shelve Griffith's film, which is an important movie for historical and cinematic study but like the Confederate Flag has no place in today's world."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An unflinching telling of history, the Sundance breakout of 2016</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The title, 'The Birth of a Nation', is a reclaiming of the same title associated with the 1915 D.W. Griffith silent film. Griffith's movie was the first epic of its kind but is a blatant and spooky glorification of the Klu Klux Klan from today's lens. It's been a blemish that can't be concealed in cinematic history since its release. Nate Parker's story repurposes the title as a symbol of how this country was built on the backbones of enslaved Africans and their unavoidable connection to a country founded on the pursuit of freedom. It's a brilliant way to shelve Griffith's film, which is an important movie for historical and cinematic study but like the Confederate Flag has no place in today's world. Parker's 2016 film most certainly does. Turner was born a slave but early on was unusually taught to read from the Bible, and would grow up to become a preacher. Through studying the Bible while living in the midst of slavery (which as Parker put it, "allowed nobody to go to sleep without a guilty conscience"), Turner reaches a point where he can no longer stay silent about the cruel injustice that, in this world, is a daily routine. At a certain point, he is tired of the slave owners abusing scripture passages to make their slaves submissive and moves toward radical action as the only path to freedom. One area where Parker shines is his depiction of the women in this world. I would advocate for calling this a feminist piece, which will get overlooked given its a movie where race is the forefront of the conversation. A slew of strong women play pivotal roles in the cast: Turner's grandmother, mother, eventual wife, along with Mistress Turner, the white baroness of the plantation Nat lives on (Aunjanue Ellis, Aja Naomi King, and Penelope Ann Miller). Multiple other women are essential to the story as well. These women play a massive role in his life and are never reduced to bit roles. It's a rarity for a male director to make so much room for prominent female roles (not to mention especially in a historical film). Overall, 'The Birth of a Nation' strikes a chord that the industry needs to feel right now and that the audience will experience upon its release. In the wake of #OscarsSoWhite and the lack of media representation, Parker's unflinching telling of history invites the public to experience a part of this nation's formation and legacy that may not be well known to the general public, and as Paker emphasizes, reflect on why it matters today.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Accurate huh? Coming from Woodrow Wilson, the man who destroyed America with the IRS and Federal Reserve... 99% of Hollywood's movies are complete embellishments and distortion of history. Just another garbage film, written by a Black, sponsored by Jewish Hollywood and the Left aimed at keeping the country divided. Nothing to celebrate.How many slave movies, how many civil rights laws, voting laws, and so called equality laws have to be passed before people realize this is nothing but a scam from the Globalist dirtballs who run and have run the banks and corporations for 150 years. They are using the white middle class male as fodder, a buffer, to absorb all the bs while they continue to look the kitty and promote racial divide. You liberals will eat it up. You know that meme with the individual with a noose around their neck and the other end of the rope is tied to a tree that is being watered? Yeah, that tree grows every time you support garbage movies like this from Hollywood. Your utopia is coming. Global enslavement, no rights under totalitarian rule. But remember, you asked for it. Because you are stupid.</fullReview>
