		<shortDescription>So Bad - Its Good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Saw the "premier" in NJ. First off, let me say Kevin Smith seems like a genuinely good dude. Actually - he is undoubtedly a great dude. Listening to him speak about film and the whole process was inspiring. It seemed like I was hearing one of my buddies talk. Very down to earth- but at the same time he'll throw out something ridiculous - but hilarious. Listening to him speak was arguably better than the movie. For the record- I wouldn't consider myself a HUGE Kevin Smith fan. I like him- but you know. I'm not one of the die hard Kevin Smith fans. I respect the hell out of him. I must admit though, I haven't seen his latest films."Yoga Hosers" had its moments. Johnny Depp is almost unrecognizable and had everyone laughing. For him to go from Black Mass to this is mind-boggling. Talk about versatility. The two main girls might not sit well with people - but with Mr Smiths prologue - I understood their performances. They are supposed to be brats who are obsessed with their cell phones. The movie has a bunch of cameos whom people will recognize from the past and enjoy seeing again. It also had a cool 80's arcade vibe. It's obviously not meant to receive Oscars or critical acclaim; but, nevertheless, it's a fun flick- with some interesting performances. The story itself is silly- in that unique Kevin Smith way. I did feel bad after at the Q and A when he kept saying he was a crappy filmmaker and that he has no skill (comparing himself to Tarantino). I know he's being humble, but it just didn't seem right hearing that. Clerks, Dogma, Mallrats? Classics man. He represents NJ well. I wanted to shout out but I was working. I think he just felt it was important to acknowledge the haters, and I respect that.So- yeah. This is a tough movie to review. The best way to put it - it's so bad it's good. I think that's the point. It definitely had funny moments. Even some creepy ones. It is a comedy though - before anything else. It's a movie for all ages really. The theater was sold out and cracking up. I do kinda wish they used less CGI - but for this type of story - it is somewhat necessary. It's a shame people have labeled it as "a play date" just because of the father /daughter + father/daughter thing. That's what Mr. Smith said at least. Overall, if you're feeling up for a weird, funny B - movie and you're a fan of Kevin Smith and Johnny Depp- I suppose it's worth a watch. I had a good time. Like I said- it's so bad it's good.6/10P.S. Very cool to learn Kevin Smith and I were born at the same hospital. Riverview Medical Center.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If you like Kevin Smith content, go see this movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me say that first and foremost you should absolutely go see this movie if you're a fan of Kevin Smith movies. Being a fan of his many podcasts and TV shows doesn't hurt either because while this is a fun movie, at no point did I as an audience member forget that I was actively watching a Kevin smith film. The best part of this film for me was that it was abundantly clear that the people on set involved in this movie were having a good time making it which is absolutely refreshing. The only downside, though minor, was that it didn't really pull me into the universe that this film lives within as much as it could have. But hey! GO SEE THIS MOVIE AND FIND YOUR OWN OPINION OF IT! Mr.Smith, onto Moosejaws please :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Watching YOGA HOSERS is like stabbing yourself in the eye with an ice pick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched #YogaHosers at Comic-Con and I ended up regretting it. In fact, I walked out of that place halfway through because the film was so awful, I couldn't even tolerate it. And perhaps I'm not the right audience for it, who knows, maybe it's an acquired taste thing. And I do have a lot of respect for Kevin Smith, I honestly do. If you've seen videos of his interviews or if you've seen him talk, the guy is articulate, he's funny, he's modest, he understands that filmmaking is a collaborative effort, it's like listening to a teacher speak. But YOGA HOSERS has got to be the worst film of 2016, hands down.Part of true north trilogy which is a horror comedy series by Kevin Smith that started with "Tusk" and will end with "Moose Jaws," YOGA HOSERS is about best friends Colleens, one is Colleen McKenzie, played by Kevin Smith's daughter who has the coolest name on earth, Harley Quinn Smith, and the other is Colleen Collette, played by Johnny Depp's daughter, Lily-Rose Depp. And so the Colleens have after school job at Manitoban convenient store where an ancient nazi evil rises from beneath Canada's crust.The film also features a lot of people from Kevin Smith's circle, plus a cameo by Johnny Depp whose great talent is absolutely wasted here. Look, to be fair, at the screening I attended, Kevin was there and he said if you like the movie, then that's good, if you hate the movie, that's cool too, man, meaning it sounds like Kevin is at a point in his career where he just doesn't care anymore about good storytelling quality. And sometimes, not caring can potentially be beneficial, sometimes there's power in not caring what other people think about you and your work. But in this case, it backfires.Watching YOGA HOSERS is like stabbing yourself in the eye with an ice pick. Just the super duper tiny villain himself and how he enters the scene are just atrocious, and at one point, the two girls were just fighting these cloned little bastards inside that convenient store, that scene pretty much describes the entire movie, which is a complete farce. You might argue in defense of this movie calling it Canadian "Clerks," but that won't hold up considering how well-written "Clerks" was. Perhaps Kevin has lost his mojo, who the hell knows. But I think it's time for Kevin to just make movies based on somebody else's screenplay because I still do believe that he's a good director but he shouldn't do his own materials, he should throw everything he writes out the window and down to the landfill, and just direct either adaptations or somebody else's original story. YOGA HOSERS is an obnoxious movie that nobody should ever see.-- Rama's Screen --</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Literally a re-imagined clerks, Kevin Smith's new addition to the true north trilogy places his and Johnny Depp's daughters in a Canadian Quick-Stop, Eh-2-Zed.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In Kevin Smith's "Yoga Hosers," his second addition to his ambitious True North Trilogy, a Canadian, gender-swapped clerks is born! And let there be no mistake, I don't mean that in a "damn, they did what to Ghostbusters?!" kind of way, I mean it in the most awesome way there is. It was truly an awesome film, even with some cameos, (Jason Mewes as a rogue cop, Johnny Depp reprising his Oscar-wining role as Guy LaPointe, and the best of all, Stan Lee as an annoyed police dispatcher!) and a nod to his brain-child clerks. When the Colleens are destroying the Bratzis, Harley Quinn yells "I'm not even supposed to be her today!" And don't forget the insanely accurate impressions done by Ralph Garman's time displaced Canadian third Reich leader, including Sylvester Stallone and I believe Martin Short. Not sure, it sounded like him. I read something that said "Kevin Smith's Yoga Hosers is an apology to the critics." Don't listen to that, man. The critics should be apologizing to you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Awesome, ridiculous, Funny as hell</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Imagine Clerks meets Ghoulies. It was supposed to be a kids movie, but ended up as a midnight movie that kids can't see yet. It was hilarious. It was weird. It was different. There were callbacks to old movies. You might want to re-watch some of the old stuff before going in to watch this one. There were awesome cameos. The king of cameos makes an appearance. The story is pretty original like most of Kevin's stuff. Killer Nazi sausages try to take over Canada. How high do you have to be to come up with that? Silent Bob high. That's how high you have to be. Johnny Depp, his daughter, and Kevin's daughter had me holding my sides at times. Please see this and enjoy it as much as I did. Huge Kevin Smith fan, so yes I am a bit biased, and I was lucky enough to see this at a sneak preview hosted by the man.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Film of 2016!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Great movie! Really loved this film probably my favorite film of 2016 so far really funny and unique! Also great acting job from Lily-Rose Depp and Harley Quinn Smith really looking forward to seeing more from them in the future! This is a great film if you love things from the 80s and 90s a really great nostalgia film! And i am a huge fan of Tusk and i think this was a perfect spin off of that and i think it was a really good idea to make a film revolving around the Colleens it was really unexpected but a really great idea! I'm really looking forward to Moose Jaws and cant wait to see where that goes and also i got to view Yoga Hoser at one of Kevin's early screenings and it was a blast!!!</fullReview>
