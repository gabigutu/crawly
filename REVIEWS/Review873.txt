		<shortDescription>The best spaghetti western ever?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Leone's 'A Fistful Of Dollars' is a bona fide western classic, but amazingly he managed to top himself with this "sequel". Yeah, I know it isn't REALLY a sequel. In fact Leone's "Dollars" trilogy actually have no connection with each other, and Eastwood's so-called "Man With No Name" actually has many! (In this movie Monco, in the previous one Joe). Most people seem go for 'The Good, The Bad And The Ugly' as the best of the three movies, but I think 'For A Few Dollars More' just beats it. Anyway, there's no argument that they are three brilliant films, Eastwood is super cool in all of them, Leone is on top form, particularly in this one, and Ennio Morricone's scores are amazing stuff. 'For A Few Dollars More' is helped enormously by Lee Van Cleef playing Colonel Mortimer, and the scenes between him and Eastwood, and the ones between him and Klaus Kinski are pure gold. This is not only one of the best westerns ever made, but one of the best movies of any genre released in the 1960s. It was also a highly influential one. I can't imagine Peckinpah's 'The Wild Bunch' for example existing without Leone. Words fail me praising movies as brilliant as this one. All I can say is WATCH IT NOW. Or if you've already seen it WATCH IT AGAIN!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of my favorite westerns- a fitting middle section to the "Dollars" trilogy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As the second of the three films legendary filmmaker Sergio Leone collaborated on with Clint Eastwood (not to mention his first with Lee Van Cleef and his second with 'Fistful' actor Gian Maria Volonte), For a Few Dollars More gets well earned respect from the fans of the director and the groundbreaking star. And yet, occasionally there are those who'll not even know this film from Leone and Clint exists since it does sometimes get under the shadow of their two most infamous works, Fistful of Dollars (which for the most part introduced Clint and Leone to the public's awareness) and The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (which solidified Clint as a Western icon and gave Leone a similar status for film buffs). But taken as a film unto itself, aside from its place in the trilogy, this is a Western that simply delivers the goods, and it does so with a spectacular marriage of style and substance. The story begins by introducing our two (anti) heroes, bounty hunters Douglas Mortimer (Cleef), former Colonel, and Monco (Eastwood), a drifter. They both set their sights on the leader of a gang of bandits named Indio (Volonte), who is plotting to go after over a million locked in a bank in El Paso. At first, Monco and Mortimer seem like their after Indio for the same reason- reward money- though there seems to be more than each man counted on with him and his gang. From the opening scenes with Cleef and Eastwood, to the scenes in El Paso, and then into the set pieces in the stone ruins in the Mexico desert(s), For a Few Dollars More displays the utmost skill by Leone in his storytelling, as well as in his use of the camera. Using Fistful's camera-man Massimo Dallamano, Leone does what he does best in his spaghetti westerns- he creates a perfectly in sync mood with his characters: each look in a scene, whether it's intense waiting for guns to be drawn, or just regular conversation, the look of the film draws the viewer in without over-doing it. Some points are made bold or repetitious (like Ennio Morricone's score, that keeps its whistling theme and serene watch theme completely in check), though it's not done to any degree of annoyance or by accident. In fact, that's what makes his westerns such fun, is that you take them seriously as films, yet he always reminds you that it's all in the 'movie-world' just by the way Mortimer or Monco strikes up a match. As for the actors themselves, Eastwood and Cleef are total pros in this genre, so ever line of dialog comes out naturally, and the supporting actors (however dubbed over from original Italian) all contribute great notes as well. At the least, it can appeal to a new generation of kids looking back to older movies, which may look at this and consider it more modernly crafted than a John Ford oldie. A+</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The finest example of the Spaghetti Western revolution</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Italian director Sergio Leone changed the face of the Western genre in 1964 when he introduced what would be known as the "Spaghetti Western" with the brilliant "Per un Pugno di Dollari" ("A Fistful of Dollars"). Not only the films looked grittier, violent and realistic; the characters in Leone's westerns became complex men with complex and obscure moral codes, very far away from the classic clear moral opposites of previous westerns. "Per Qualche Dollaro in pi?" ("For a few dollars more"), is the epitome of all this. It is a powerful, raw and ruthless masterpiece that transcended its genre and became one of the best movies of all-time."For a Few Dollars More", the second in the so-called "Dollars trilogy" (a group of films by Leone with the same style), is the story of two different yet very similar men, Manco (Clint Eastwood) and the Colonel Douglas Mortimer (Lee Van Cleef) are two bounty hunters who are after the criminal named "El Indio" (Gian Maria Volont?). An unlikely alliance occurs between the two lone wolves as they decide to cooperate and divide the reward, but are these two killers after "Indio" for the same reason? Written by Fulvio Morsella and Sergio Leone himself, the film's main characteristic is the complex moral code the main characters follow. They are no longer the perfect clean heroes of classic westerns, both Manco and the Colonel have well-developed attitudes, motivations and purposes; they are neither completely good nor completely bad, they are just real. The story unfolds with a fine pace and good rhythm, it is probably the best structured of the "Trilogy" and the easiest to follow. It is also the one that represents the elements of the Spaghetti Western style the best.Stylistically, the film follows closely the conventions established by Leone's previous film but it takes them to the next level. The excellent use of minimalistic cinematography and the superb musical score by Ennio Morricone complement Leone's realistic vision of Westerns and completely redefined the genre's conventions. "For a Few Dollars More" is a violent tale of two hunters, and visually the film transmits the same emotions the characters feel. No more myths, the Westerns never felt this real.Clint Eastwood's super performance as Manco is very important for the success of the film, as he is the one that takes the audience through this brave new world, however, the star of the film is Lee Van Cleef as Colonel Mortimer. In one of his best performances ever, Van Cleef manages to be both menacing and interesting, giving life to Leone's brilliant script with great talent. Gian Maria Volont? as Indio complements the two big talents as the crazed criminal with a dark past, he is the perfect counterpart of the two lone wolves."Per qualche dollaro in pi?" is a near flawless movie, as every piece of the puzzle falls into the right place to create a marvelous and unforgettable picture. It's only minor problem may be the dubbing, but fortunately, it still is superior to the one heard in other Italian productions of the same time and it doesn't hurt the film. Fans will always argue about which of the three films of the "trilogy" is the best, and while personally I prefer "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly" over this one, it is just a matter of personal taste as this film is as perfect as that one. A real classic that changed the face of Western as we knew it. 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best of "The Dollars Trilogy" and quite possibly Leone's finest film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"For a Few Dollars More" has become the template for which most Spaghetti Westerns derive. As Leone went along, his films got more daring and complex, exploring new ideas and raising not only the bar for Spaghetti Westerns (which, contrary to popular belief, were around before "A Fistful of Dollars") but for Westerns in general. However, this exploration at times affected the quality of his films. Leone was a popcorn director - a visual stylist who always entertained first and maybe provoked a thought or two second. However, his films were never think pieces so when he tried to integrate depth into his films the results became uneven. "For a Few Dollars More" is his best film because it catches Leone in his most transitional period. At once the film is more complex and stylized than "A Fistful..." and more tight and efficient than "The Good, the Bad and The Ugly" (which is almost on par with "For a Few..."). The revenge sub-plot involving Colonel Mortimer is more compelling than the similar one in Leone's "Once Upon a Time in the West" because Mortimer is more developed as a character than the Harmonica Player (which is not to insult the great Charles Bronson). And hell, it has Lee Van Cleef as one of the biggest bad-asses of all time. The mere presence of Colonel Douglas Mortimer elevates the film to a new level. He steals the film from "Manco" completely. And Van Cleef's theft of the film is what makes it a cut above "A Fistful...". As a character, "The Man With No Name" (who in actuality has three: Joe, Manco and Blondie) isn't very interesting and there always needs to be a counterpoint to play off of him. That's why "A Fistful..." isn't nearly as good as this film or "The Good..." (which had the great Eli Wallach in one of the best scenery munching performances ever).So in closing, "For a Few..." is a tight masterpiece of fluff Western entertainment. It's mean, violent and immoral, just the way any good Spaghetti Western should be.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Excellent fun with sadistic humor from Leone. Eastwood's best performance in a Leone film. Van Cleef is good in a role similar to Chuck Bronson's in "Once Upon a Time in the West". He is menacing and sympathetic, whereas in "The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly" he is just campy and all "bad guy" (but still fun). What makes both performances so memorable I think is that Van Cleef seems to be in touch with Leone's dark humor, where Eastwood is used as a straight man. Volonte is also excellent in the bandito role Leone used (an example of a standard European character type who reminds the audience of earthiness and the basic ignorance and greed of man). A much better film than most people who've seen it on a Saturday afternoon on TV probably realize -- you have to see these movies in the theater to get the full hit.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A classic in every aspect.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"For a Few Dollars More" is the middle film of Sergio Leone's classic western trilogy starring a then upstart Clint Eastwood. Sandwiched between "A Fistful of Dollars" and the finale, "The Good, the Bad, &amp; the Ugly." This film provides further insight into Eastwood's "Man with No Name."Eastwood is a bounty killer who is in search of the feared bandit known as El Indio. Colonel Douglas Mortimer (played by Lee Van Cleef) is in a similar position, and the two cross paths many times in their pursuits of El Indio. The premise has similarities to that of the first, and in fact won't be all that surprising to most younger viewers. But at the time, the various plot turns and twists were unique and revolutionary. The pace is both a pro and con at the same time. Unlike modern films, the usual western showdown scenes unfold very deliberately. Rather than simultaneously begin and end in a furious volley of bullets, the encounters are set up slowly. On the bright side, this gives both the characters and the viewers an opportunity to fully appreciate the choices made and the consequences that will follow. From a negative perspective (not mine), one might say that the gunfights are plain slow, and the action is too sparse. While I enjoyed the change of pace, I also understand why some will say otherwise. Others portions of "More" can hang with any western sequences ever put on film. Highlighting the action is a robbery scene, the creativity of which ranks with any modern heist out of "The Score" or "The Italian Job."This trilogy catapulted Clint Eastwood to Hollywood fame, and one can see his star-making charisma ooze through the screen. Blending stoicism and machismo wonderfully, Eastwood produces the epitome of the tough and arrogant loner cowboy. In a role that could easily have been overshadowed, Van Cleef holds his own against Eastwood. His character was probably similar to Eastwood's in his youth, but Van Cleef accurately reflects the wisdom that would likely come with his character's age. The motley crew of baddies is filled with men who completely look their parts. That's about all that is asked of them, and they deliver. The cinematography of "More" follows in the groundbreaking footsteps of "Fistful." While one might not notice anything revolutionary now, at the time shots like that had scarcely been seen. Shots like the low-angles utilized prior to a few shootouts, as well as the framing of space are all now staples of cinematic westerns, and they originated here.Ennio Morricone's score is also a classic. Whether serving as epic background music for sweeping crane shots or providing aural cues during action sequences, the music is always appropriate and often the best part of the film. Bottom Line: While it might not seem as great now, so much of this movie was groundbreaking and remains classic that it merits 8 of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"For A Few Dollars More" sees the return of the Stranger, the Man With No Name, but this time he has a defined profession, as a bounty hunter? He is searching for a drug-addicted murderer, known as El Indio? The film opens with another bounty hunter, Colonel Mortimer (Lee Van Cleef) arriving in the town of Tucumcari and with great coolness and precision killing one of his list of wanted men as the suspect attempts to flee? Mortimer then goes to the saloon where he encounters No Name, who is calmly dispatching four men at a saloon? No Name walks, in a leisurely manner, to the sheriff's office to collect the bounty on their heads? Having established their mutual aims and equal talents, the two men decide to team up in pursuit of El Indio? The murderer is portrayed as infinitely more evil than the two conscience-free professionals: he has a positive relish for killing?EI Indio is planning to rob the bank at El Paso, so the bounty hunters meet up there in order to waylay him? During the discussion that leads up to the showdown, it is revealed in flashback that Mortimer has a personal score to settle with the villain? Nothing is revealed about No Name's past in this conversation, and typically in keeping with the characterization, No Name infiltrates El Indio's gang? This continuing challenge to the Western myth of the perfect hero and the irredeemably evil villain was spelled out in words at the beginning of the film: 'Where life had no value, death, sometimes, had its price.' Within this mayhem, Leone tried to stick to his new morality. 'I wanted to show that most heroes do what they do for money. I also wanted to prove that bad guys can sometimes have their good side. Al Capone, for instance, had a certain kind of humanity.'</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Awe-inspiring, classic western by one of my favorite directors. QT fans, this is the trilogy he got his inspiration from.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"For a Few Dollars More," the middle installment of the iconic Sergio Leone/Clint Eastwood "Dollars" trilogy, is the most brutal of all three films. Throughout the movie, ruthless bounty hunters, all of who seem to have no respect for human life, often perform cold-blooded murders. The bounty hunters use the "wild west" as a free range: they track, they kill, and they collect.One of these bounty hunters happens to be The Man with No Name (Eastwood), who returns to us now after his introduction in "A Fistful of Dollars," which was the first movie of the trilogy. (An interesting observation is that the "man with no name" actually does have a name in each installment -- here, his name is Manco, but this is a fact that is often forgotten.)The Man with No Name/Manco is on a mission to find the criminal Indio (Gian Maria Volonté), whose capture is worth a large sum of money. It is quickly set up that local law enforcement is weak. Sheriffs are cowards. Only the vicious bounty hunters know how to drag in the criminals: dead or alive. Along for the journey is a fellow bounty hunter named Mortimer (Lee Van Cleef), whose own reasons for seeking the man differ from Manco's. At first, the two killers go their own separate ways, and then decide to team up together and improve their chances of finding Indio -- despite the fact that their intentions for his capture are different.Not only are the two men's intentions different, but also their methods. Mortimer is a ruthless, cold-blooded murderer whose self-confidence is revealed through his barbaric actions. Manco, the hero, is less of a murderer and more of a law enforcer. Leone quickly sets this up through a sequence of shots: Mortimer's introduction, for example, begins with his search for a criminal, which finally comes to a finish as Mortimer confronts the man (who is hiding in a brothel). His foe manages to escape through a window, leaping onto a horse and galloping away through town. The images that follow reveal an insight into Mortimer's own self-confidence and startlingly calm nature.Manco's appearance is even more dramatic. He tracks down his own victim, and corners him in a saloon, only to see three cowboys appear out of nowhere and block off all exits. In one quick motion he swings around and fires three successive shots, each bullet finding its target.Here it is established that Manco is an underdog; therefore, our story's hero. He isn't as ruthless as Mortimer (who mercilessly picks his prey off from a distance) and his actions are somewhat admirable. The cowboys who tried to kill him were the bad guys. Manco was the good guy.Its lesser admirers often describe the film as being "too long". It's true that the film contains some unnecessary scenes, and these are often dragged out for dramatic effect -- but that is the point. The movie, directed by one of cinema's most ambitious and visionary directors (Sergio Leone, 1929 - 1989), is all about long passages of close-ups and wide-lense shots. Along with its predecessor and particularly its sequel, the "Dollars" trilogy revolutionized the derogatory "spaghetti western" description. In the years to come, Hollywood would actually aim to create films similar to the "Dollars" movies -- all of which were inferior. The entire "Dollars" trilogy has such scope, and ambition, that its Hollywood counterparts pale in comparison.Leone's direction is magnificent and would later inspire -- of all people -- Quentin Tarantino (whose "Kill Bill" movies owe something to the "Dollars" trilogy). Long, wide lenses and extreme close-ups only accentuate the fear of the men. There is a particular sequence of shots that clips back and forth between Mortimer and a wanted notice pinned to the exterior of a building. Leone slowly builds up the back-and-forth shots until they burst into a pattern of super-speed images, distinctly closed with the sound of gunshots. It's this sort of blazing, distinct style that makes the film so infectious and enjoyable.The acting cannot be criticized, although the English dubbing is sometimes rather laughable. Eastwood is one of the only actors whose voice is not dubbed -- but he rarely speaks. His face does all the talking. Lee Van Cleef (who was re-cast by Leone as a separate character in "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly") manages to turn Mortimer into one of the quintessential bad guys of cinema. Although the dubbing can occasionally detract from the flow of scenes and dialogue, the two lead performances by Eastwood and Van Cleef more than compensate for this slight flaw.Hollywood was cautious about releasing "Dollars." Eastwood, known for his role in the television series "Rawhide," was the only marketable star. The director was an unknown Italian with no commercial successes. As its predecessor before it, "For a Few Dollars More" was delayed release in the States, where it was deemed "unworthy."However, the movie was a huge success in Italy, in particular; Clint Eastwood quickly gained a cult fan base overseas, but it was not until May 1967 -- after the US release of "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly" -- that "For a Few Dollars More" and its predecessor would open to critical accolade and deserved celebration in the United States. Now, almost forty years later, it's still a fascinating piece of classic cinema.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Western! Awesome on all levels</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is the second best western i have ever seen with The Good, The Bad, The Ugly being first. I disagree with someone who wrote that this movie is not as good as A Fistful of Dollars. This movie is way better than a fistful of dollars. The reason is (as i pointed out in my other post) is that Clint's role or character is better when he has a good supporting member because it gives Clint's character more depth as well as throw a wild card into the mix. Lee van clef is excellent in his role, i still have him labeled as the bad but it was surprising to see him play a good guy in this one. Both bounty hunters have their own styles which meshes really good on the screen. Gian had more depth to this one which played perfectly into Lee Van Clefs character. In a fistful of dollars Gian didn't have much depth at all and some of the characters were annoying. I like how leone tied all of the characters into each other in this one, having all of their stories somehow play a role in the other ones. If you haven't seen this movie i suggest you watch Leone's films in chronological order with A fistful of dollars first, this one second, and finish it off with the good the bad the ugly. You'll be glad you did.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of my favorite movie lines of all time as spoken by Klaus Kinski upon recognizing Lee Van Cleef in the little cantina as the one who used his (Klaus') cheek to strike his match earlier in the movie. When Kinski ask if he "remember me, amigo," Van Cleef just reply "uh uh." To which he's asked to try that trick again, which prompts Van Cleef to utter another one of my all time lines - "I generally don't smoke 'til after I've eaten; why don't you come back in five minutes." Just typing this brings smiles to my face. I've been a Lee Van Cleef fan since High Noon (with Robert Wilke) and Kansas City Confidential (with Jack Elam and Neville Brand!) and this was/is the movie that made him a star. Granted it didn't last for long, but he did have his 15 minutes. This is my favorite Spaghetti Western, it was also my first (didn't see "Fistful" until much later - and Good, Bad, Ugly was a major disappointment - I wanted Van Cleef to play the same role). And the music, especially the pipe organ, just blows my mind. Highly enjoyable; think I'll go and watch it again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Man With No Name Meets His Match</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Without doubt among the best of the western genre, Clint Eastwood and Sergio Leone's Man With No Name trilogy, the unofficial launch of the "spaggetti western" subgenre, rewrote the rules, using the intangibles of cinematography, Ennio Morricone's haunting scores, and settings to extract engaging storytelling despite the less-than-flawless dubbing of character voices and the cheesy sound effects (the overused gunshot sound is straight out of Warner Brothers cartoons). Combined with exciting shootouts, Leone's trilogy made movie history and remains compelling cinema.Arguably the best of the Leone trilogy is this second installment, a sequel to A Fistful of Dollars. Contrary to the nickname, Clint Eastwood's character does indeed have a name - identified as Joe in Fistful, here he is identified as Monco. And he also has an equally ruthless and skilled rival in Colonel Douglas Mortimer (Lee Van Cleef in his finest performance). Indeed, the theme of the film is the rivalry of the two bounty hunters turning to mutual respect and eventually to teamwork, shown in the climatic showdown with the villianous Indio, a brutal killer (perhaps a bit too brutal for the film's own good) with whom Mortimer has a score to settle, a score that becomes clear in the haunting chimes of the watches owned by both Mortimer and Indio. Pairing Eastwood and Van Cleef was a good idea even before shooting began, and pairing Joe Monco (The Man With No Name) with Douglas Mortimer proves it with the superb chemistry between the two bounty killers, a chemistry that elevates an engaging story to true masterwork.</fullReview>

And that's exactly what happened to Sergio Leone. After the success of A Fistful of Dollars a sequel was underway and that gave Leone and Eastwood the opportunity to make this character into there own. Here Eastwood is a bounty hunter not a simple gunfighter like in the original. He teams up with another bounty hunter played by Lee Van Cleef who both are after Indio for two different reasons. In this film Leone emerges as an artist. When this film was released times were changing. The new and old generation were in a battle. The vietnam war had just begun and hippies were taking over the country. By pairing the characters of Eastwood and Van Cleef there was bound to be conflicts."They usually end up shooting themselves in the back."From their partnership they understood and learned from each other. Meaning there is something new to be learned from each generation.RATING: 4 STARS</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Completely defying the tried &amp; tested Hollywood formula and introducing his own style of narration that was more character driven, glamorized violence &amp; also added a new dimension of moral ambiguity into its characters' psyche, thus bringing both heroes &amp; villains very much on the same level, Sergio Leone presented a whole new outlook of the Wild West in A Fistful of Dollars but with this second chapter, he further accelerates the inevitable rebirth of the western genre.The second installment of Leone's Dollars trilogy is quite an improvement over its predecessor in almost all departments of filmmaking &amp; gradually portrays the developing maturity in Leone's craftsmanship. Starring Clint Eastwood as a bounty hunter looking for a number of wanted suspects, who later partners with another bounty hunter looking for the same guys &amp; make a deal of splitting the reward but in the end when it comes down to final showdown, one of them shows their real motive behind the hunt.Featuring an improved direction from Sergio Leone, For A Few Dollars More presents the director in more control of his artistry &amp; has a much stronger script to muster ahead with. The scope of camera-work, the precision of editing &amp; overall production design also get their upgrades plus the performances from the recurring cast turn out to be better than the previous film with Clint Eastwood &amp; new addition of Lee Van Cleef impressing the most.On an overall scale, For A Few Dollars More is another huge step towards placing the coffin on traditional westerns &amp; presents a significant evolution of every single aspect of its making when compared with A Fistful of Dollars. Ennio Morricone's music also leaves a bigger mark than before &amp; it's exciting to observe how seamlessly it accompanies the drama. A rare sequel that improves upon the original, For A Few Dollars More is absolutely recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Man with No Name is back and this time he's got company. On the trail of the diabolical El Indio, a most wanted fugitive, our hero crosses paths with Colonel Douglas Mortimer. Mortimer is also after El Indio. After some manly posturing in which The Man with No Name and Mortimer shoot each other's hats the two decide to team up to go after El Indio and his gang. El Indio is currently targeting the Bank of El Paso, supposedly an impenetrable institution in which there is a safe containing almost a million dollars. The pair of bounty hunters plan to infiltrate the gang before the robbery and, if all goes according to plan, take down El Indio with ease. Of course, when does anything ever go according to plan? There will inevitably be complications. And when there are complications in a Western that can only mean one thing. Shootouts. Lots and lots of shootouts.The movie has a simple but reasonably engaging story with a few interesting characters. But the movie really fails to spark to life. The pacing is laborious, there are way too many times in this movie where absolutely nothing of any importance is happening. And even the shootouts, where you would expect the movie to shine, get dragged out to the point interest starts to wane. Once again Clint Eastwood does a fine job playing the ever-stoic Man with No Name. Lee Van Cleef brings a little much-needed personality to the role of Mortimer. And Gian Maria Volonté certainly makes for a convincingly detestable villain as El Indio. But despite the credible performances of the three main players the movie still disappoints. The rest of the cast makes very little impact, El Indio's mostly faceless gang making little impression. There's not enough going on with the story to really grab you. A couple of bounty hunters go after a bad guy. Some people shoot at each other now and again. That's about it. The movie ultimately tries to introduce some different motivation for why some of the characters do the things they do. But by then it's too late, you're really just waiting for the movie to end by that point. With some tighter pacing, some sharper action, this could have been a movie which really worked. As it is it's a bit of a letdown. Certainly not The Man with No Name's greatest adventure.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of Best Westerns Ever Made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Exceptional performances by three heavyweight actors, Gian Maria Volonte and Lee Van Cleef - both of whom, it's a shame, did not have all that many more opportunities to shine in quality films after this one - and Clint Eastwood, along with taut direction, editing, cinematography and gripping and unique music (by the great Ennio Morricone), make this movie a real standout. (The music's almost a major character in this film, in fact.) Stylistically iconic, this Sergio Leone opus has an endlessly fascinating and spellbinding story that surprises to the end. Plus, we really come to like the co-heroes, Van Cleef and Eastwood - we want to befriend them and emulate them. Volonte was priceless as a demonic villain - his facial expressions rich with narcissism and a strange kind of violence-fueled euphoria no one else has ever matched in film history, for my money. Though he clashed with director Leone and purportedly did not like the Western genre, Volonte's performance rises above the film's genre and could be favorably compared to the best portrayed villains of other more mainstream movies. Volonte brought a realism to his character and an intensity you don't see in many films. But so did Van Cleef, whose work in this film is incredible. You'd have thought other movie makers would have rushed to cast Van Cleef in important roles after this film, but no. Very strange. Though some might question the wanton violence in this film, the truth is that the real wild west was even more violent and the violence often much more capricious and random. Like all great artistic works, this film never grows old for me. I am always drawn to watch it again and again for it is of such a depth and complexity that it only reveals more of itself with each viewing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Per qualche dollaro in pi?: A journey of style ... Leone in action</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was my favorite-Western before I discovered "Once Upon a Time in the West" (English title), Sergio Leone's superior-masterpiece. But when I keep on mentioning "For a Few Dollars More" (English title), people to not follow me in the same way. These two Leone-movies have many differences, but they still have something in common. Booth has the excitement and the hard core mood that I seldom find in other movies.The story: The film might seem thin ? but keeps into it's own core. Instead of focus on too much story, Leone's direction, the set design, the costumes, the presence of the actors and Morricone's music gets in focus and creates an unforgettable masterpiece and one of the most entertaining movies ever. A Western like this doesn't need more story than it has.The storytelling: The film starts with the presentation of colonel Douglas Mortimer, reading in the bible on a train which he stops by his own hand ... the next scene contains 'The Return' of the man with no name ... wee see Clint Eastwood walking through the rain at the side of his horse, lighting a cigar before he enters a smoke-filled saloon. These first eminent scenes contains superb duels, and in spite of the fact that they are long, they have the highest suspense and tempo with booth silence and Morricone's pumping music combined with typical Leone-exaggerated sound effects which steals your whole attention. The presentation of the three main characters takes almost 30 minutes. Slow and boring? I found these 30 minutes to be the best part of this film and this excellent start of the movie makes it a classic in the Western AND in the Action genre! After this amazing start, the tempo becomes a bit slower but the rest of the movie is still a masterpiece...The heroes: The man with no name (Clint Eastwood) is harder than ever ? Clint is at his best from start to end. Than we have Lee van Cleef, in his best performance, as Douglas Mortimer. He is VERY cool and mean here. Forget about the sequel "The Good, The Bad and the Ugly" (English title). This is his best role. Lee is superb as the former colonel, a relaxed and smart hero in black clothes, wearing lots of weapons ...The villains: A filthy, evil, rotten, bloodthirsty Gian Maria Volenté is El Indio (not as handsome as in "A fistful of Dollars" (English title) but just as powerful and even more menacing) and he has a bunch of bandits where Klaus Kinski, Mario Brega and Luigi Pistilli makes great performances as really tough and bad guys. Just watching Luigi Pistilli in his best shape and a truly spectacular Klaus Kinski can make anyone satisfied.The direction: When it comes to Leone himself this is one of his most personal and stylish directions. No other movie has succeeded to imitate this perfect film. It is not just an Italian Western. This is a fast-paced action-movie. It is loud, fast and mean. Sergio Leone's camera ... with his close ups, the perfect editing, the never-ending pans ... the loud noise from the pistols and the riffles ... and the screams of dying desperadoes.The music: Ennio Morricone has made many good soundtracks, but I think that this is his best together with the one in "Once Upon a Time in the West" (English title). They are two different kinds of Morricone-soundtracks; this is the tough one, the other more operatic and in classic style.The trilogy: The other Dollar-movies misses the pace and speed of this one. This Dollar-movie has the toughest action scenes. From the start to end, the guns keep on shooting...Rating: 10 of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Leone's best film but still a great example of the genre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Two bounty killers do well plying their trade in the west to great effect. When a large bounty is put on put on the head of the bandit El Indio both men find themselves out to collect. They strike a partnership to go after him and his gang together and split the bounty. However both men have different things in mind and try to double cross each other and adding bits to the plot that the other didn't expect. Meanwhile El Indio also has his own plans to outsmart the two and make off with more than his fair share of the money.For a Few Dollars More is a strange beast. The sequel to a Fistful of Dollars this is both better and not as good in equal measure. The plot is less fun that the original although it is full of little twists and turns which, while good, aren't as good as the original. Too much is going on and the plot is a little too twisty for my liking but it is still enjoyable. All the trappings of the spaghetti western are there and are good.Leone's direction is also good and he has the same style he had in the original, although not at the level he masterly commands in The Good, The Bad and the Ugly. The use of music is excellent and haunting although the story doesn't always support it as well as it would in later Leone films (both the `once upon a time in?.' films come to mind). E Indio's pocket watch is well used in several stand-offs but also sparks several of the usual flashback scenes.Eastwood is good but suffers from sharing the same running time with Van Cleef. The two are good together but not as good as they will be later and both men needed more time to establish themselves. Volonte is good as El Indio and is not allowed to be just a bad guy, but to have a past and pain that haunts him.Overall if you liked Fistful of Dollars then you'll enjoy this. It isn't as good as The Good, The Bad etc but it is a classic piece of spaghetti western ? from the score, the direction right down to the customary showdown.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Western Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The second entry into the world of Sergio Leone's western landscape delivers more nerve tingling gun duels, a greater insight into what drives the characters, and a more powerful soundtrack which in all Leone films forms the basis of what he is trying to portray. Leone uses the brilliant Ennio Morricone music to demonstrate the emotions of the characters, and the situations that they find themselves in.Fresh from the successful film A Fistful Of Dollars, Clint Eastwood stars again as the Man With No Name, a man who is identified by this spaghetti poncho and his fast drawing gun action. As the title card states "Death Sometimes Had Its Price, That Is Why The Bounty Killers Appeared" basically describes the motives of Clint Eastwood's character, he is a bounty killer that goes up against criminals that have a price on their head.However like anything in life there is competition, for Eastwood it comes in the form of a quiet, intelligent and efficient killer Col Douglas Mortimer played brilliantly by Lee Van Cliff. Mortimer is driven by a deeper motive, one that goes beyond reward money and goes closer to his heart. Lee outshines Eastwood in most of the scenes with his efficient killing style, and his vast array of weaponry.Eventually both men collide as a villainous and psychotic man El Indio escapes from prison, and plans with the help of his ruthless gang to rob the bank of El Paso. Gian Maria Volonte plays Indio with such perfection and realism, and gives the viewers a much more in-depth look into his character. As viewers we sense that Indio is a disturbed man, with a long past that has made him psychotic and ultimately evil. It was enjoyable to see Volonte have a wider role as the villain, as in the previous film A Fistful of Dollars his villain Ramon Rojo didn't really go into second gear. As the film progresses Eastwood and Lee's characters realise that they must form a partnership in order to bring down Indio and his gang of killers, both for different reasons.For A Few Dollars More is one of the best westerns ever made with its greatly orchestrated gun duels assisted by this breath taking soundtrack, making it a must see western. This has always been my favourite in the Dollars Trilogy as it has a well told story and just one you cant take your eyes off. A Brilliant Director and A Brilliant Film!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Man With No Name is back. Two bounty hunters at opposite ends of the scope. Both killing for money. When they both discover they're after the same man, they start a feuding over who will walk away with the money. At times it gets confusing when you get two thirds into the movie when everyone starts double-crossing each other, but otherwise, it's a great shoot-out of a western. There are several nice pieces of machinery seen in the film, not quite as fancy as those in the Sabata trilogy. Yes, there are a handful of obvious low budget shots, but it still holds up well as the middle piece of the trilogy. It may be the not as popular as the other two, but it's still Clint Eastwood at his best.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Leone's Best... now with SPOILERS for several movies!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It took me a while to admit it, but this is Leone's best movie. It may not be as artistic as GBU or OUATITW, but it's a surprisingly well-made movie considering the other 2 get all the attention. This is the most gritty of them, has the best character development, the best shootout, the quintessential spaghetti western score, and is flat-out the most fun.It doesn't have Tuco running through the cemetery, but it has some astoundingly good scenes. For instance, the camera cutting back and forth between Van Cleef's eyes and the Wanted poster with intermittent gunshots heard; the duel for pride between Eastwood and Van Cleef; and, of course, the final showdown. This final showdown is hands-down the best of any Western. It's more interesting than GBU's because the characters mean more. The bad guy is a miserable wretch whose only comfort from his past is violence, Van Cleef's revenge motivation is far more compelling than Harmonica's in OUATITW, and Eastwood is just plain the most badass he's ever been. When Clint walks in with the watch playing the music, you just feel like standing up and applauding. Frankly, I find the duel in OUATITW rather underwhelming and I don't quite understand why some people call it the best ever. It's short, predictable, and nowhere close to this one.The ending is also very satisfying. It's sort of a happy ending, but not sappy because Clint is just way too badass driving away with all the bodies, on his way to becoming a super-rich badass.Overall, it's a close call with GBU, because I also love that movie for many reasons (and West isn't too shabby either). Now I don't want to be one of those guys complaining about a Leone movie being too long, and that's not what I'm doing, but FAFDM also has the advantage of being about 50 minutes shorter than GBU, and 30 shorter than West. This makes the movie more accessible and more practical to watch than the other 2. You can't really watch the other 2 without sort of planning beforehand, whereas with this one, you can watch it on a whim if your bored, without sacrificing 3 hours.Great movie -- the one I come back to again and again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Awesome bit of classic cinema- not on TV nearly enough</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I recently watched this movie for the first time after finally finding somewhere to rent it from (thankyou Lovefilm). My first impression was simply thinking wow, why haven't I heard more about this movie? I understand the fame of it's trilogy partners, as A Fistful Of Dollars was Eastwood's debut western and The Good, The Bad and The Ugly was the first Leone film to be widely advertised at it's release, but For A Few Dollars More breaks the pattern of the middle film in the trilogy being the poorest, as it is genuinely the most enjoyable watch of the three. I think that the feel of the movie is about as close as Leone could have got to perfection. Perhaps the most obvious reason for this is that the plot is based on bounty hunting, which just works so well. It's a storyline that you feel like you've seen a thousand times (probably on Warner Bros cartoons), but pulled off in the most satisfying way imaginable. I honestly can't sing this film's praises enough. Agreed, the whole trilogy is a masterpiece, but this one has the balance between a great music score, involving plot lines, superb one-liners, inspiring acting, exciting shootouts and memorable characters down to an absolute fine art. All I can say is well done Leone, you outdid yourself on this one. It's rekindled my love for the Spaghetti Western.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Where life had no value, death, sometimes, had it's price."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This morning strictly by chance, I happened to watch "Any Gun Can Play" from a DVD set of spaghetti Westerns, a film largely considered a knockoff parody of "For A Few Dollars More". So this evening, in a bit of cosmic serendipity, the Sergio Leone classic happened to be playing on AMC, thus inviting a chance to compare notes.'Dollars' has not one, but two scenes where Eastwood's Monco character guns down three outlaws in rapid succession, the first time when confronting Red Cavanaugh, and later on the trail to Santa Cruz to rob the bank with a trio from Indio's gang. It's the latter that more closely resembles the opening scene from 'Any Gun...' However the dead on copy is the balcony binocular scene when Eastwood and Van Cleef realize each other's presence as a potential payday threat. It sets up an interesting hat duel between Monco and Colonel Mortimer.Hey didn't you just love those facial tics on Klaus Kinski as the Hunchback when Mortimer strikes a match on his face; I tried doing it and it's not that easy, especially when you add the menace. The other character that got my reaction was the Old Prophet telling Monco how he didn't sell his land to the railroad (as the train passes by - great touch!); I had a mental picture of Robin Williams doing that scene in exactly the same way.I started counting when Mortimer considers three reasons for he and Monco to team up to defeat Indio. For starters, it would be fourteen against one for either of them to go it alone. Secondly, better make it fifteen to one while each has to keep track of the other bounty hunter. Now was it just me, or didn't Mortimer spell out the third reason, unless one assumes it was for one of them to infiltrate Indio's gang. Anyway, as far as story continuity goes, after Monco takes out three of Indio's men on the way to Santa Cruz, the gang is shown riding a couple of times and you can count thirteen men on horseback. Forty years later and this version of the Western genre is still going strong, and for my part, they'll always have a taker when I'm flipping through the channels. I guess it's the no nonsense way of dispensing justice and the fearless mentality of it's protagonists against insurmountable odds that captures my fancy. The haunting musical score doesn't hurt either.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The man with no name goes to work</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For a few dollars more is Sergio Leone's 2nd installment in his classic Man with no Name trilogy. This is the expanded version of the story of the American Wild West as seen in the context of Far eastern realism and morality. It started with Leon's low budget remake of Karosawa's Yojimbo. In that film the man with no name (even though he has a name in each film, we are meant to feel that the name is not true, but something given to him by others). His true name in each film are unknown, hence the man with no name. Here to one post office clerk, he calls himself Manko, so in one scene only that name is referred, but is is soon forgotten and never used again.A fistful of dollars introduced us to this quick drawing silent gunslinger who sells himself to the highest bidder.Here our man enters his chosen trade. That of a bounty hunter. In the final chapter of the trilogy, he used that trade to make his own rules. In this film he works it to the best of his ability and learns as he goes along. Here he has a teacher. The old man. Lee Van Cleef. The teacher. The man with the past. Leon invented the core of spaghetti westerns, which is the protagonist must have a grudge against the villain, which makes their confrontation spiritual and more dramatic. This has been used to good and mostly bad effects by thousands of action films since. Nobody used it better the Leon. Here Van Cleef is our protaginist and not Eastwood. In this film the man with no name watches and learns and assists. Plies his trade and the emotion is left to his teacher and the villain. This film is superb and better then the first film. Our villain is evil and psychotic and smart and greedy. Our hero is greedy, smart and silent. He learns to love his teacher and helps him get the revenge. He then keeps what he wants. The money. yet we love him. We love the teacher and we love to hate the villain. A classic in film fantasy enjoyment. The West is given a real feel of a period long time ago. And if it was wild the west is shown here to be just that. Sheriffs are bought and sold and the fast gun rules.A must for all true movie fans. And then it was followed by act III...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Next western masterpiece by Leone.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The action takes place in El Paso (Mexico), along with Rio Bravo, around 1875. The characters in the play are violent, immoral, vicious and selfish. They are anti-heroes who act on interest in a place where there is good and bad, because they are all villains. The presence of women is marginal, so some Leone accused of misogyny. The West is for him a harsh, arid, violent land inhabited by solitary men terse words, greedy without ideals. The film contains many remarkable scenes, such as the assault to the bank, the confrontation of the two gunmen and the final scene, definitely the best of the film.The music, written and directed by Morricone, in line with the previous film, adds new instruments like castanets, and innovative effects (dry single press of a single button serious piano, guitar chords, musical chime pocket watch , harsh sounds whip). The human hiss becomes more important and combined with other sounds (flute, soprano higher). It is implemented by the Spanish singer Kurt Savoy. The fight scenes are accompanied by a rich percussion, which creates an absorbing atmosphere of tension, drama and restlessness. The photograph benefits from the increased importance in the film is visual storytelling that verbal. Pay special attention to gestures, gaze, gait, with close-ups that enhance the excitement. The night scenes illuminated with floodlights and focused, bluish light (silences), red (violence) or combinations thereof. Interpretations of Eastwood and Cleef are excellent and complement each other, than a balanced and powerful set is derived. Volonté replica is made with dedication and conviction.More elaborate film that "Per Un Pugno Di Dollari", thanks to a greater willingness of time, better training, more experience and a less tight budget.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One Of The Greatest Westerns Ever Made. An Excellent And Unforgettable Classic From Sergio Leone And Clint Eastwood.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For A Few Dollars More is one of the greatest Westerns ever made,an excellent and unforgettable classic that's filled with amazing direction,great performances,incredible Action and a fantastic score. All of those elements make For A Few Dollars More a terrific film and one of my favorite movies that is Sergio Leone and Clint Eastwood at their best.For A Few Dollars More tells the story of The Man With No Name(his name is Monco in this film)who is now a bounty hunter who teams up with fellow bounty hunter Colonial Douglas Mortimer(Lee Van Cleef)to take down sadistic outlaw Indio(Gian Maria Volonte)dead or alive.After the Box Office success of A Fistful Of Dollars director Sergio Leone and Clint Eastwood were both asked to do a follow up and the two responded with For A Few Dollars More the second film in The Man With No Name/Dollars trilogy and is a brilliant,thrilling and intense Western classic that grabs you by the throat and doesn't let go until the very end and will keep you glued to the screen. Sergio Leone was given a much larger budget with than the one in Fistful and it truly shows because with For A Few Dollars More Leone expands the scope of Fistful and gives this movie a bigger and much larger canvas that is gripping and incredible with an epic style that is operatic. Where as Fistful was inspired by Akira Kurosawa's Youjimbo Leone For A Few Dollars More comes up with his own story and does it in a flawless and stylish way that is pretty amazing. With each of The Man With No Name/Dollars movies Leone's style grew and led all the way up to his masterpiece The Good,The Bad And The Ugly where Leone took the trilogy to a higher level. If A Fistful Of Dollars was about the war between two rival families then For A Few Dollars More about how life and death has a price and outlaws were brutal and vicious with violence being the only option and Leone gives us a stylish yet gritty look at the Old West. What makes FFDM so great and interesting is the teaming of The Man With No Name(Monco)with Mortimer because we see both of them are good bounty hunters by themselves but together they make a lethal combination and both want to capture Indio but for different reasons. Monco wants to capture Indio for the money where as Mortimer wants Indio for the money and personal reasons which makes Mortimer a strong and complex character. Monco and Mortimer like any duo that teams up together have clashes because both either want to do their own thing or it's because of their different personalities but the two start to respect each other. You will enjoy the relationship between the tough and gritty character Monco and Mortimer. Where as Monco and Mortimer are charming and likable antiheroes the character Indio who is the villain in the film is a horrible and vicious character who is so evil that he has no chance for redemption or to be good again because when ever kills a person Indio does it with a twisted glee that is disturbing. Every time Indio showed up on screen you feel like no one is safe from his violent wrath and you are rooting for Monco and Mortimer to catch him. Indio is a character you will never forget and is one of the most intense characters you will ever see in a Western film. While FFDM is without a doubt a classic and one of Leone and Eastwood's best the movie is often seen as the weakest film in the trilogy. I guess the reason some people say that is because it's not as groundbreaking as A Fistful Of Dollars or as epic and sprawling like The Good,The Bad And The Ugly or the story is isn't strong. In my opinion the story in FFDM is strong and had enough greatness the keep viewers entertained. The Action and gunfights in FFDM are truly thrilling and are done with white hot tension and suspense that never quits. The ending in For A Few Dollars More is outstanding and a classic finale filled Action,explosive moments and surprises. A terrific ending.The cast is great. Clint Eastwood is excellent once again as The Man With No Name(Monco)with Eastwood commanding the screen. Lee Van Cleef is brilliant as Colonial Douglas Mortimer and has great chemistry with Eastwood. Gian Maria Volonte is amazing and intense as Indio a sadistic outlaw. Mario Brega(Nino),Luigi Pistilli(Groggy)and Klaus Kinski(Juan Wild)give good performances as well.The direction by Sergio Leone is fantastic and stylish with Leone always moving the camera using close-ups,zooms and creative visual style. Amazing direction,Leone.The score by Ennio Morricone is dazzling,haunting and epic and matches the tone of the movie perfectly. Another great score,Morricone.In final word,if you love Sergio Leone,Clint Eastwood,Westerns or films in general,I highly suggest you see For A Few Dollars More,one of the greatest Westerns ever made and an excellent,unforgettable classic that you will watch again and again. Highly Recommended. 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"When two hunters go after the same prey,they usually end up shooting each other in the back"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Two bounty killers,Manco(CLINT EASTWOOD) and Colonel Douglas Mortimer(LEE VAN CLEEF),a sharpshooting ex-army officer, hunt crazed bandit El Indio(GIAN MARIA VOLONTE)and his murderous gang. Rivals at first, the two bounty killers later decide to join forces to wipe out the gang. Manco is motivated only by the reward, but Colonel Mortimer has more personal reasons.In the months following the monumental success of A FISTFUL OF DOLLARS, the European population were thirsting for more Spaghetti westerns. Sergio Leone was obliged to make a follow up to his first film. Clint returned as the stranger, again turning in a restrained but ruggedly stupendous performance. In his first Spaghetti western, Lee Van Cleef spectacularly portrays Colonel Mortimer. Lee owns the screen in any Spaghetti western that he appears in and it's fair to say that this film belongs to him.Although,the script refuses to elaborate on the Colonel's military past, thus making the character a tad one dimensional. Regardless of this however, he was still the best character in the film and Colonel Mortimer will always be one of my favourite Spaghetti western anti-heroes. I was stunned by his deadly arsenal of weaponry, which includes several long range rifles and pistols. The Colonel's weapon of choice, a mean looking long range Single Action Army pistol, is put to terrific use in the action scenes.Gian Maria Volonte rivals Lee Van Cleef for best performance in the film. His sadistic laugh pierced my eardrums and the fact that his character is half insane gave Volonte's scenes a horrifying edge.The score by Morricone is better than the score of Fistful. The film's gritty tone is poignantly evoked by the magnificent title song. The "Eye for an Eye" piece impressively sets the tone for the tense final showdown.FAFDM is masterfully scripted with every scene skilfully penned and crammed with sturdy dialogue. There's a welcome pinch of humour added to the script with a couple of scenes prompting a slight chuckle. I did find that the film became a little convoluted in it's second half, but this was only a minor flaw that did not affect the film as a whole. The chemistry between Colonel Mortimer and Manco created a superb atmosphere. The scene that takes place in the darkened street and has the two titans having a shooting contest with each other's hats deserves to be relished.In FAFDM,Leone focuses mostly on suspense,excellently building tension throughout the film,especially in the action sequences.Most of the action in this film comprises of ritualistic duels.These duels are made all the more gripping as the characters ready themselves to the tune of a musical watch, before drawing their guns and shooting as the tune ends. The first duel in which El Indio forces an unfortunate character into one such ill fated showdown(after ordering the man's wife and baby killed)had me uneasily piercing my fingers with my teeth. In my opinion, accompanied by the jarring soundtrack, the climatic face off between Colonel Mortimer and El Indio was the most finger biting, nerve wracking and taut showdown in the entire film. Leone had already tightened the tension into a robust knot, for example with the scene near the beginning of the film in which Colonel Mortimer guns down an outlaw in the street. Sergio had then pulled this knot much tighter for the duel between the Colonel and Klaus Kinski's hunchback. The stunts were awesome, with the action sequences packing some highly impressive kills. The jail break scene was exciting and the bank robbery really had me on the edge of my seat. The final shootout which precedes the aforementioned climatic showdown has Colonel Mortimer and Manco going head to head with El Indio's gang. This sequence was immensely exhilarating. A few chilling flashbacks provide Colonel Mortimer with the motive for wanting to kill El Indio and gave the film greater bite.FAFDM is the grittiest film in the Dollars trilogy. It's grittiness will leave a lasting bitter aftertaste and the flashbacks in particular leave a queasy feeling in the stomach. Despite a few small flaws, like the film's length and it dragging a little at points, Leone still excellently surpasses his previous effort. He continued to blaze a searing new trail in the western genre, a trail that would blaze even more fiercely with the release of the final film in the trilogy, THE GOOD,THE BAD AND THE UGLY.10/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Thanks to the huge success of "A Fistful of Dollars", which thanks to Sergio Leone began a new era for Western movies and mark the beginning of his and Eastwood career. Sergio Leone began to make the "sequel" with the same cast of his predecessor, bigger, but with small errors it doesn't surpasses its predecessor, but continued epic and Badass!"For a few dollars more", begins with the cruel criminal El Indio (Gian Maria Volonté) escaping from a Mexican prison with the help of his gang killing in cold blood all the guards on their way. The news comes fast with wanted posters with his pictures scattered in all American cities. One of the posters captured the attention of Col. Douglas Mortimer, a bounty hunter who soon begins to plan how to get Indio dead or alive. Not only Mortimer, but also caught the attention of Monco (Clint Eastwood), another bounty hunter who also covets the reward for the capture or death of Indio. When both hunters unwittingly meet each other face to face, knowing Indio's plan to rob a bank heavily guarded, they decide to work together to get Indio and share the big reward for Indio and his gang. But Monco discovers that Mortimer objectives go far beyond that to receive the reward, much darker than that.Many consider that this movie is not a sequel, but according to Eastwood it is. The reason for this consideration is mainly Eastwood's character. While in the predecessor he was this mysterious man who called himself Joe, trying to take advantage of a gang war cashing out at the end. And in this one he is a bounty hunter who calls himself "Monco" who makes a certain justice catching and killing criminals, those are the differences but the age of time is the same. The first movie was located at the time of the gang warfare on the frontier and the time of the American cavalry, and this one is happening in 1873, the same historical age. And, Joe-Monco in the first one he heard advices from the city's innkeeper saying that one day everyone had to sit in one and honest work, that is exactly what he does this one. Killing bad folks and earning money.The film's problems are few and forgivable, but compared with the 1st movie, it makes a certain lack. I'm talking about the film's narrative, while in the 1st movie she was very well written and flowed perfectly in a superb script. In this one, the 1st hour of the movie almost nobody says something, and we only know most of the story in the remaining hours of the film, now flowing perfectly. And in the first film since the first half hour we were completely coated in history. But this was actually Eastwood's own idea. He liked so much of his character that he starts investing and exploring a lot (the Joe-Monco fur were from Eastwood). And advised Leone to him give less dialog to increase the mystery of his character, and of course, increase our Goosebumps when he talks.But this little problem, paved the way for the magnificent direction of Leone. Not only in the duels scenes, which here are not only better than the 1st movie but are more tense and the direction in each one is simply superb. But the moments that stand out are the fantastic Italian and Spanish landscapes serving as the American Old West.And the performances simply excellent: Clint Eastwood.....do I need to say something?; Gian Maria Volonte who was almost the same role in the 1st movie, the good shooting and cruel villain, but thanks to his exuberant performance it lends an air of a psychopathic villain; Lee Van Cleef superb. Leone's idea of putting two Badasses shooters is a experiencing that at the time of the film no one had ever seen it, jaws went straight to the floor and the chills came by every word. And the duel between the two, it was advanced for the time, is not a duel with both shooting each other, but each one testing the skills of each other.This movie is one of those sequels that are only one step behind the predecessor. But thanks to the genius of Leone in both direction and screenplay, and the exuberant performances, "For a few dollars more" remains an excellent continuation and an important part in the masterpiece trilogy.10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bigger and Better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sergio Leone's sophomore film in his Spaghetti Western trilogy and is a major step up from A Fistful of Dollars. This was a film that didn't appeal to me, the first time I have watched it but as I watch it more and more along with others within the trilogy, I start to see the great things about this film. For A Few Dollars More is much more bigger and a much more better written film than it's predecessor.For A Few Dollars More was written by both Leone and Luciano Vincenzoni. Both have written a story that is engaging and this is due to a plot with much bigger stakes, and rewards, and also much better written characters. This film fleshes out the characters much more than it's predecessors, taking it's time to show each person's agenda and their personalities, yet Leone and Vincenzoni still has kept the unpredictability that was found in the first film. Oddly enough, even though Eastwood's character is the main star, the film's emotional significance was much more apparent on Mortimer and El Indio. Their back story is the reason that I care about these characters, it tells us why they are who they are. For A Few Dollars More's script has it's humor pumped up in comparison to the first film and I felt that this work. It actually gives the film much more character and helps not make the tone of the film too negative.Sergio Leone has created a film that is much more cinematic and traditional in comparison to the first film but at the same time not trading off the uniqueness of the first film, which was the slow building tension and the close ups of people's faces focusing on their reactions and the emotional facial acting by the actors. This film does increase the beat of the film, with editing that moves the film along at a pace that keeps us on our toes. Leone has definitely have gained much more confidence going towards this film as the film doesn't feel as indulgent as the first and seemed to show much more enjoyment with the story than the first film. This film's budget was much higher than the first film which allowed him to create settings that feel real and lively.Massimo Dallamano is back as the cinematographer of this film. The film looks much better than the first film and this may be due to the increase in budget and shot at better locations or it could be due to Dallamano and Leone has a much better understanding of what they want for this film. The film still retains that style from the first film with close ups that take it's time to move things along but it's much more improved here as they have used different angles and techniques in constructing these shots, allowing them to feel fresh. Dallamano has the camera move in this film much more than the first. The first film has it's shots set up in a way that doesn't require the camera to move or zoom into anything. This movement makes the film move faster and exciting.Ennio Morricone comes back to do the score for this film and it's just as great as the first one. The score here sounds much more fuller and dramatic, this may be due to a much larger story and much more characters focused on. Morricone's score here may not be as memorable as the first or third film but it definitely fits with what is shown on screen and it doesn't feel recycled. The film's score feels fast and upbeat, which sound great in moments of the film that have characters riding their horses on the beautiful backdrops. Morricone also has a much lighter and smaller track that plays during the build up of climax, the music that comes from the lockets. It sounds beautiful and it connects with the emotional weight during these situations.The film's cast is much bigger in this film and the film is now shared with three characters rather than a main focus on Eastwood. Clint Eastwood is great here as expected but not as memorable as A Fistful of Dollars. Lee Van Cleef brings something different to the film which gives the film much more personality. Leone loves to have actors banter in his films and it's definitely apparent here with the focus on the friendship on both Eastwood and Cleef's characters. Both actors work well together and it's a shame that this isn't the case for the next film. Gian Maria Volonte is back for this film as the antagonist, this time his character is much better written and his acting is much more effective but it may not appeal to everyone as he has increased the dramatics in this film in comparison to the first film.For A Few Dollars More is a much better constructed film than A Fistful of Dollars with a bigger and better story and improvements on the acting and photography. The film is great to watch on its own and does not require to watch the first or third film to understand but if you have seen the other films you get to pick up on the small things that Leone has put in this film.</fullReview>

He's not only as good as Clint. In many ways, he plays a superior character. His character has secrets. He has mysteries. Clint is playing a much more simpler character. For me, this is superior to 'A Fistful of Dollars' in the trilogy. The story is more iconic, cleaner. The characters have more depth.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrific Western with Strong Action and Characters</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For a Few Dollars More (1965) *** 1/2 (out of 4) The second film in Sergio Leone's trilogy has rival bounty hunters (Clint Eastwood, Lee Van Cleef) agreeing to work together to try and bring down the ruthless Indio (Gian Maria Volonte) and his gang. FOR A FEW DOLLARS MORE is a major improvement over the previous film and it's also one of the best Spaghetti Westerns ever made. The film is a lot better made than the previous installment and instead of just one great character we're given two and a terrific villain as well. The entire film just has a more epic feel to it as Leone doesn't go for just style but instead he takes his time in telling the story, letting us get to know the characters and the entire situation just slowly builds up to the terrific finale. Of course, the story itself is just a fun one with two great bounty hunters wanting money and going for a main score. The opening to the film is terrific as we get to see how both hunters work and you get a clear picture that both of them have different styles but the end result is always the same. It obviously doesn't hurt that Eastwood and Van Cleef are so terrific in their parts. You really couldn't have thought up a better duo for this picture and the two actors do a very good job and especially in their scenes together. Gian Maria Volonte is also extremely good as the villain and it was fun seeing Klaus Kinski in his role as the hunchback. The cinematography by Massimo Dallamano and the music by Ennio Morricone perfectly blend together and with the story and action. FOR A FEW DOLLARS MORE is certainly one of the best of its kind and deserves its reputation.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My favourite Dollars film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This would be the only film from the Dollars Trilogy (between A Fistful of Dollars and The Good, The Bad And The Ugly) that isn't an Empire 5-star rated film. So, in order to complete the trilogy, I decided to watch this one anyway to satisfy my need for completion to see why it wasn't awarded the prestigious five stars.Compared with A Fistful Of Dollars, For A Few Dollars More is a far more developed film, albeit a completely different story. The stories lead into each other though (although you don't need to watch the first to understand the second), as The Man With No Name continues his bounty work which we are introduced to in the predecessor.The introduction of The Man In Black - Colonel Douglas Mortimer - helps to prove that Eastwood's Man With No Name - this time referred to as Manco - is not as omnipotent as he appeared in the first film. That said, Eastwood's character still retains the mystery as the number of lines he is given are few and far between. We never learn much him, but that doesn't stop us admiring his quick hands.For A Few Dollars More also uses the same iconic soundtrack as its predecessor and, while its whistling can become irritating, it is one of the key driving forces behind the film as the camera flicks between characters during the agonising stand-off.Personally, I prefer this film to its predecessor. Maybe its because I knew what to expect, but its probably more likely that Sergio Leone was given far more freedom to express his unique characters.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hats off to Clint and Lee.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Clint Eastwood returns as a man with no name (who is, this time around, named Monco and is apparently not the same character from the first movie) and finds himself grudgingly teaming up with Lee Van Cleef as the pair of them, both bounty hunters, try to capture an infamous baddie and his unruly gang. The motive is money but there is more to it than that for Van Cleef's character and all will be revealed before a finale that will, inevitably, feature bullets under a boiling sun.In the second instalment of the highly regarded "Dollars" trilogy we get all the same kind of fun we received the first time around plus a major bonus in the shape of Lee Van Cleef. The interplay between him and Eastwood provides a much more satisfying dynamic than we had the first time around. And the "hat duel" scene is both brilliantly entertaining and absolutely perfect in establishing the moral compass of both characters.Also featuring another great score from Ennio Morricone, this is yet another treat for Sergio Leone fans although most fans have surely seen the trilogy numerous times by now.Where things fall down ever so slightly is in the pacing and the characterisation. The movie packs a fair bit in but somehow still feels like it's dragging in a few places, cramming more in than is needed and lacking that energetic economy that suffused the first movie. It also sacrifices any drama/tension for entertainment and while this isn't always a bad thing here it makes for a negative point as Eastwood and Van Cleef never seem in any real danger and while their characters are so thinly sketched in it requires some real effort on the viewer's part to continue to identify with them, archetypes of the "Old West" as they pretend to be.Still, nobody really does lively, entertaining, sun-scorched, cheroot-chewing Westerns like Leone and this is another classic for many fans of the genre.See this if you like: A Fistful Of Dollars, The Good The Bad &amp; The Ugly, Once Upon A Time In The West.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>El Indio, a notorious bandit, is sprung from prison by his gang of hoodlums and hatches a plan to rob the bank of El Paso. However, two ruthless bounty hunters are after the reward on his head, and are soon on his trail ...Per Qualche Dollaro In Pi? is to Leone's great revisionist western Per Un Pugno Di Dollari as Dawn Of The Dead is to Night Of The Living Dead; not as original, but in every other way a better film. It's more mythic, much better acted, has more spectacle and a grander style, and cemented the reputations of Leone, Eastwood and composer Ennio Morricone as the spaghetti western auteurs par excellence. At the heart of it are three totally different and utterly enthralling performances. Eastwood is completely iconic in his classic Man With No Name role - he's so mysterious he's really just a collection of props: a poncho, shrunk-to-fit jeans, a hat, a leather gauntlet, a cigar, a gun. He's the hero who never behaves the way a hero should and yet somehow still is. Van Cleef, as the smart, capable Colonel Mortimer is the puppet-master of the film - the other characters seem to dance around him - and his cool, unblinking resolve is extraordinary. The scene where he strikes a match on hunchbacked Kinski's hump (cult movie star heaven for film geeks) and they stare each other down is a definitive Leone moment, as crucial as Van Cleef's pipe or his Buntline Special revolver. After languishing in bit-parts and TV roles for years, this role made him a minor star who went on to appear in many offbeat classics, such as El Condor and Escape From New York. Yet for me the best performance in the film is Volont?'s astonishing turn as Indio, one of the most fascinating, vicious, complex, thoughtful bad men in all cinema. Indio is an almost unique character-type; the burned-out villain. He's done such dreadful things that almost nothing can satiate him, yet he keeps going. He doesn't seem to care about himself or money, he dices with death, he's haunted by the memory of Mortimer's sister, he smokes marijuana to fend off his demons and keeps exclusively male company. He's almost child-like and yet deeply philosophical at the same time. It's a wild piece of acting. Morricone's brilliant, toe-tapping, lunatic score is one of the most memorable in any western, full of odd instruments (Jewish harps, whistles, timpani, recorders, bells) and incredible trills which act almost as quotation-marks around the action and characters. The last ten minutes are awash in extraordinarily beautiful music. Leone, along with his writing partners, Fulvio Morsella and Luciano Vincenzoni, create a riveting, action-filled, heart-in-the-mouth western adventure, packed with machismo and sly humour (the cut-throat town of Agua Caliente literally means "hot water"). Leone's great genius was to galvanise his players and technicians into creating something completely unique and totally cinematic. He went on to even greater heights with his subsequent Il Bueno, Il Brutto, Il Cattivo, but this preceding classic is a treat to savour, with three mesmerising performances. Shot in Almería in south-western Spain and at Cinecitt?, and released in the US in 1967 by United Artists, with the title For A Few Dollars More.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Two bounty hunters are going after the same man ? a crazed escaped convict named Indio (Gian Maria Volont?). Realizing that the job is too big for either one alone, Col. Douglas Mortimer (Lee Van Cleef) and Monco (Clint Eastwood) decide to put their egos aside a team-up to get their man. But can these two men take on and take out an army of outlaws? A Fistful of Dollars may have come first and The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly may be the fanboy's choice, but my favorite movie in Sergio Leone's Dollar's Trilogy is For a Few Dollars More. In contrast to the first movie in the trilogy, For a Few Dollars More is a more sophisticated, more confident film. Leone took the ideas he developed in A Fistful of Dollars and ran with them. There's definite growth in Leone as a director. Similarly, you can see growth in Eastwood and Morricone. All three ? director, actor, and composer ? were coming into their own with confidence to spare. And in comparison with the better known third movie in the trilogy, For a Few Dollars More is a tighter, more fluid film. It may be one of the best movies ever made, but The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly does tend to drag every now and then. That's not he case with For a Few Dollars More. There's not a wasted moment. But please, don't misinterpret anything I've written ? I think all three movies are works of genius. I just happen to prefer For a Few Dollars More to the other two.Beyond Leone, Eastwood, and Morricone, any discussion of For a Few Dollars More wouldn't be complete without mentioning the rest of the cast and the sets.? The Cast: Eastwood may be the more known commodity, but he often is upstaged in this movie by both Van Cleef and Volont?. In fact, Volont? steals most every scene in which he appears. His dope-smoking, homicidal Indio is one of the most ruthless and memorable characters I've seen in a Spaghetti Western. Another interesting casting decision is that of Klaus Kinski. His screen time may be limited, but his scenes with Van Cleef are among the most memorable in the movie. The rest of the cast, especially Mario Brega and Luigi Pistilli, are just as solid.? The Sets: For a Few Dollars more looks like a million dollars thanks to some wonderful sets. Some of the villages found in and around Almeria, Spain, are incredible looking. It would be difficult to duplicate the authenticity of a place like Los Albaricoques with its cobbled streets and white-washed adobe buildings. Yet when called upon to do so, Carlo Simi designed and built some equally impressive sets. His attention to detail in the planning and set decoration is impressive.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Watched With A Blind Eye</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first movie I saw in the Dollars trilogy was THE GOOD, THE BAD, AND THE UGLY. This was the third in the series I saw and Lee Van Cleef had two strikes going against him. Because he was playing opposite Clint Eastwood and because he was such a nasty villain in THE GOOD, THE BAD, AND THE UGLY, I was a bit prejudiced against Van Cleef's character, Col. Mortimer the first time I saw this movie. Now, after several viewings, I've come to sympathize with his character almost as much as Clint's Manco. Like ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST, Van Cleef's character is a bit like Harmonica's in that he has a personal score to settle with Indio. Also, like ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST, Col. Mortimer's motives are shown through piecemeal flashback sequences throughout the movie. Though his and Clint Eastwood's characters have different motives for wanting to track down Indio, I found myself rooting for both of them the last time I saw this movie, ie, Manco is motivated by money, Mortimer motivated by revenge.The only annoying thing I found about this movie, and it seems to be true of every Western I've ever seen, is that while the main villain is kicking the crap out of the good guys (and in a Sergio Leone movie, that term is used rather loosely), his cohorts are standing around giggling like a bunch of little girls. I have seen this in just about every Western I've ever watched and it tends to get a bit annoying. Barring that, anything put out by the team of Leone, Eastwood, and Morricone with his haunting music is nothing short of great. That chimes tune will move you to tears once you understand what it's all about. And that hunchback would have done well to heed Eli Wallach's advice from THE GOOD, THE BAD, AND THE UGLY. "If you've gotta shoot, shoot, don't talk." But that's for another movie and another time. Great effort, L, E, and M. 9 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best western ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>All three dollar films are great, but this one is special. The story which unfolds, the characters and story line. This has got to be the best of Sergios films. The theme throughout the film is haunting. The cinematography is superb. The only downside, is once you see this film, no other can live up to it and you always end up comparing to this one. I suppose thats when you go to the other two.Lee Van Cleef is most memorable as Mortimer, Valonte is more enigmatic than Ramon in a Fistfull and Eastwood has matured somewhat. There are so many memorable lines in the film. The character interplay is truly excellent. Mortimer ever so precise and thoughtful, Indio always calculating and in a rage and Manco always subtle. It is difficult to describe more without spoiling the film and plot. I guess the next best thing to do is to see it for yourself. If you are a Spaghetti Western Buff, then you must have already seen it. If you are not, then this will make you one.I have always wished a sequel to this great film was made, but then again maybe it just could not have ever lived up to it. A most enjoyable and excellent film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>In a world where life had no value?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>? death sometimes had its price. After the success of the groundbreaking Fistful of Dollars, Sergio Leone returned with his second instalment in the dollars trilogy. The scale was bigger, the style was bolder, and the moral standards were lower.The title itself works on many levels. The films budget was of course somewhat more than the cheaply made Fistful. On top of that everything is pushed just a little further in this picture. Whereas Fistful was just set in one town, we now travel all over the old west, and for the first time we see those incredible landscape shots that Leone did so well. The direction and storytelling is much more confident. There is a fairly bizarre level of stylisation, with huge facial close-ups, fast paced editing and long-drawn out stand-offs.Many viewers talk of Leone's debt to classic Hollywood westerns, as well as the films of Akira Kurosawa, but while these are part of the mix his style really reminds me of nothing more than Sergei Eisenstein at his most flamboyant. Think about those fast edits between Mortimer's face and Indio's poster, or the series of close-ups during each build up to a gunfight, then look at Eisenstein's Strike or October and you'll see what I mean. Those films must have been a massive influence on Leone, although it's rarely acknowledged.Each of the three main characters gets their own lengthy introductory scene which take up nearly a full half hour before the story really gets underway. We open with Mortimer, his head buried in a bible. Given the way he acts afterwards ? forcing the train to stop, intimidating people and coldly and calmly killing an outlaw ? this is an example of the rather ambiguous attitude Leone takes towards religion throughout this and his other pictures. Manco first appears in a thunderstorm. Indio's first scene is gloomy and sinister. All three men are established as killers. Nearly all the characters are after one thing ? money. It's not just the bandits and bounty hunters. Even the boy who holds Manco's horse is always after another dollar. I say nearly all the characters ? there is of course one goal more important in the spaghetti western than money, and that is vengeance.For a Few Dollars more isn't just bigger in every way, it's also better in that it is more professional, particularly the acting. Clint Eastwood had by now gained more confidence, and had perfected his slow, silent, moody persona that would become his trademark. There are plenty of great supporting parts, and the dubbing of Italian actors is pretty seamless. However the real jewel in the crown was the rediscovery of Lee Van Cleef. Van Cleef had made a career of bit parts in Hollywood westerns, usually as a mean-looking outlaw. Leone cast him as the most heroic and honest of the three main characters. Perhaps a touch of irony was intended, but the truth is Van Cleef turned out to be a great actor (I'm always particularly struck by the very genuinely emotional look on his face when he realises Manco has taken his watch), and ideally suited to playing the good guy for a change. Having retired once in Hollywood, he eventually enjoyed a second career as one of the most prominent leading men in the spaghetti western genre.Of course, the mix of Leone's films wouldn't be complete without the music of Ennio Morricone, and here for the first time director and composer are truly in synch. Morricone is truly Leone's musical equivalent. Just like Leone's shooting style, Morricone's music isn't afraid to draw attention to itself. In this era a good film score was supposed to be one you didn't notice, but Morricone does the opposite. It is weird, wonderful and very listenable in its own right. The music in For a Few Dollars more is also matched up to the action in a way that hadn't happened since the days of silent cinema. Each character gets their own little musical motif ? Mortimer has the Jewish harp twangs, Manco the bouncy flute melody and Indio the ominous bells. It's not a background score ? it's excessive musical punctuation for Leone's style. In that first great duel in the church between Indio and the man who turned him in, when you hear that eerie little pocket watch tune, and then the organ crashes in with a rip-off of Bach's Toccata ? then you know you're in the Leone zone!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Western Stripped To Its Basic Elements</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many consider this film the most perfectly realized of Leone's trilogy, though I prefer the grander sweep of The Good The Bad and The Ugly. This is the best film in the series to start with, though, being slightly more polished than Fistful Of Dollars, and it's easier to follow as a template of the Leone style.Contrary to popular critical opinion, this is definitely not a 'revisionist' western. What Leone has done has stripped the traditional western story down to its essential elements and flipped it. Basically, this is an ordinary western saga seen through a distorted (or clearer, depending on your viewpoint) lens. All westerns were generally made with the same characteristics, that is, a good guy and a bad guy. The good guy was simple: a lawman or rancher protecting something. The bad guy was usually the more interesting one. Leone made the so called 'good guy' more interesting, and more vicious than the villain. The story becomes the mirror image of the American Western, reflected from the deserts of Spain.Eastwood, despite the dispute of others, is "The Man With No Name", and it's not only his identity that's unknown, it's his motives, his purpose, his origin. He's the focal point of the story, even though here he spends a lot of background time, letting Van Cleef and the others stand out in many striking scenes. This is Leone's genius at work. We never forget Eastwood is there, somewhere.The two great characteristics of the trilogy are the close-ups and the music. These are better done here than in the others. Seeing this film for the first time, I was struck by the faces, which seemed to jump out of the screen from another place and time, definitely not the west of "Gunsmoke". The soundtrack, both stirring and haunting, will be celebrated a century from now. But the most amazing thing about this movie is that a film created on another continent and with a cast and crew of mostly Europeans is considered one of the greatest American Westerns.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Name For a few dollars more and you will think of The good, the bad and the ugly - and the other way round. Which one is Leone's best? GBU has Ely Wallach, Ffdm has Gian Maria Volonte. Do you think The silence of the lamb is about Evil? Or Psycho? Then watch Ffdm. El Indio enjoys his evil deeds. He is not driven by demons in his head or something; he has chosen for it. El Indio is the most frightening character I have ever seen in any opera, play or movie. The characters in Ffdm are more interesting - those in GBU are archetypical. So GBU raises some philosophical questions, Ffdm does not. The side characters in Ffdm are more developed: think of Cuccillo (Aldo Sambrell), Wild (Klaus Kinski) and Groggy (Luigi Pistilli). Also Leone makes full use of the triangular relation of El Indio, Cpt Mortimer and Monco, something he does not in GBU. But why should we care? A fist full of dollar clearly was a warming up - For a few dollars more and The good, the bad and the ugly both are extraordinary. Closer to perfection is hardly possible.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Ingenious Second Film In Leone's Brilliant Dollar Trilogy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sergio Leone's "Per Qualche Dollaro In Pi?" aka "For A Few Dollars More" of 1965, the ingenious second film of the Dollar Trilogy, is a brilliant and essential Saghetti Western milestone, that is only surpassed by Leone's two most brilliant masterpieces to follow, "The Good, The Bad And The Ugly" and "Once Upon A Time In The West". "For A Few Dollars More" even outshines its brilliant predecessor "A Fistful Of Dollars", and deserves to be named as one of the greatest and most important Westerns ever made!Two bounty hunters, Col. Douglas Mortimer (Lee Van Cleef) and Monco (aka. The Man With No Name, Clint Eastwood) are both trying to track down a vicious and sadistic outlaw, the villainous "El Indio" (Gian Maria Volont?). Sometimes working together, sometimes against each other, the two men strive for the same goal for different reasons.The acting in "For A Few Dollars More" is superb. Clind Eastwood plays the Man With No Name with perfection again. Lee Van Cleef is great as Col. Douglas Mortimer, a character who is equally cool, witty and clever as the Man With No Name. And Gian Maria Volont?'s performance as El Indio is brilliant and diabolic, Volont? definitely knew how to lay stress on cruelty, evilness and insanity for a role. The supporting cast is not inferior in its brilliance, as it contains such great actors as Luigi Pistilli, Mario Brega, Aldo Sambrell, Benito Stefanelli and the great Klaus Kinski, who plays a hunchbacked henchman of El Indio's.The cinematography is, once again, superb. The movie was shot in the beautiful Spanish Almeira, which was definitely the best location for Spaghetti Westerns to be made, Ennio Morricones brilliant score is not only great (Morricone is always great), it is one of his best compositions.A beautifully shot, brilliantly written and directed Spaghetti Western, "Per Qualche Dollaro In Piu" is a powerful, impressive and violent film. Out of the three Dollar movies, the character of the Man With No Name, who actually has the name (or alias) Monco in this, is the roughest in "For A Few Dollars More" and in many occasions, Lee Van Cleef's character Col. Mortimer is actually the more sympathetic of the two bounty hunters. Excelled only by its successor "The Good, The Bad And The Ugly" (which is arguably the greatest Western ever made), there is no doubt in my mind that "For A Few Dollars More" is one of the best Westerns ever made. A brilliant movie in all aspects, a must-see, not only for Spaghetti Western fans like myself, but for everyone. A brutal, powerful, stylish, witty and impressive stroke of genius, "For A Few Dollars More" is a movie that is, in one word, perfection. 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is not a spaghetti, it is a caviar western.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For those like me who did not see this western when it was released, be prepared to spend a bit more than two hours with your adrenaline flowing. This time there are two stars in the film, Lee Van Cleef and Clint Eastwood, with Van Cleef shining just a little bit more. Both are bounty hunters who seem to only care about money, but you feel there is a mystery in relation to Van Cleef. They are interested in a bank in El Paso, which seems to be more protected than any bank in the country. This bank is also the aim of the bandit El Indio (Gian Maria Volonte) for whom there is a high reward. There are great scenes in the film, the camera always seeming to look for new angles, and great moments also, like when Van Cleef provokes Klaus Kinsky who cannot really answer because it will compromise his mission. You can see the anger in Kinsky's face as it twitches. For this film to be great instead of very good, it would only need a visit to the editing room where a sacrifice would have to be made and a bit of cutting done. The problem is that the final part is a bit too long and confusing. Gian Maria Volonte is a great actor, but we were spoiled by Eli Wallach in The Good, The Bad and The Ugly, who was magnificent in a similar role, so it is hard not to compare.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Simply Incredible</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is, I think, the first of Leone's true masterpieces, and quite possibly Leone's most "watchable" film. A Fistful of Dollars is a great film: revolutionary, gritty, violent, and fun, and it certainly was the true beginning of a monumental change in westerns. However, this is the first film where Leone's brilliance fully comes to the front. On the other hand, while not quite as famous (in the English-speaking world) as the Good, the Bad, and the Ugly (GBU) and perhaps not quite as great a cinematic achievement as GBU or Once Upon a Time in the West (OUTIW), this film is nevertheless not far behind those clear masterpieces.The characteristic Leone visual style and incredible artistry are very powerful here. Although some of this is evident in small amounts in the previous film, here we really get to see the incredible, revolutionary close-ups and the contrast between close-ups and long shots. These and other images are powerful and beautiful. The film also brings the deliberate pacing and wonderful, almost unbearable, build-up of tension before quick action. Leone's sense of irony and brilliant weaving together of various motifs and symbols (particularly religious) also comes to the forefront in this film, as does the humour.The story is more complex than before, and more emotional and profound than GBU or OUTIW. Not until Duck, You Sucker! does Leone really delve more into emotions and psyches more than here, which gives this film an added depth and power. The scenes showing Indio's psyche, obsession, and mental decay are also powerful and perfect. Some (including Leone himself, apparently) feared that Volonte was overacting a tad, while others point out how the flashbacks are supposedly inaccurate portrayals of the effects of marijuana, however, this all works incredibly well. Volonte is quite convincing as a criminal sinking into a form of psychosis and obsessed with personal demons of the past and the flashbacks work brilliantly at hitting this theme home, creating an powerful, surreal, mournful, and lonely eeriness that, although it is not clear at first, perfectly parallels Mortimer's own despair and quest.The the way in which the story progresses, and brings the three main characters together, is brilliant. The introductions of the characters to how Mortimer and Manco focus on the same bandit (Indio), but with the reason for the interests rather subtly and vaguely indicated from the start, to how Mortimer and Manco "duel" before joining forces (sort of) is perfect. The music here, while similar to, and less famous than, the score for GBU, is also simply incredible. Just as this film reveals the first full flowering of Leone's gifts, it is also the first full flowering of Morricone's abilities and style introduced in the prior film. The score is in fact just as incredible as Morricone's subsequent ones and it excels at creating a sense of loneliness, despair, mournfulness, and eeriness in a way the even GBU doesn't and which fewof his other scores have. The only scores of his that I can think of which match or excell it on this point Once Upon a Time in America (at least with respect to despair, mourning, and loneliness), The Great Silence, OUTIW (but the harmonica music only) and The Untouchables (in despair and eeriness). This score thus perfectly conveys the atmosphere of the lonely, unpleasant towns, the lonely, harsh life of the bounty hunters, the harshness of the outlaws and Indio's increasingly crazed mind, and Mortimer's despair and personal quest. Finally, we for the first time get to see Lee van Cleef in a first role and he is simply outstanding. He handles the role so well, it's hard to imagine that he had nothing even approaching this magnitude before. This film really has no real faults, the only ones being a few technical errors such as the discrepancy in the wanted poster that Mortimer slides under the door near the beginning. However, these are tiny, most people won't notice, and no-one should really care about them. They are also problems that vanished in Leone's later films where he had more time and more money. In terms of length and pacing, this is also one of Leone's shorter, faster-paced films. Only a Fistful of Dollars and Duck, You Sucker! compare in those terms. This can be good, or bad, depending on the person, interests, or mood. Personally, Leone's longer masterpieces are my favourites, but sometimes even I don't have the time or patience to sit through their relatively slow development (and I am someone who can watch the 3.75-hour Once Upon A Time in America over and over) and want the quicker pace, action, and wit of this film. Also, certainly for some people this movie will be better suited on this point and those who find GBU or OUTIW to be a tad long should opt for this. It certainly is one of the two most lively and fun of Leone's films (the other being the longer GBU). On the whole, the combination of everything makes this a brilliant masterpiece and the pacing and development make the film extremely fun and fast-paced to watch. It is a clear masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The cinematography of the wild west</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Why is For a Few Dollars More one of the greatest movies of all time? Passion. This is an exercise in suspense, violence and beauty. From Leone's tic perfect casting to Eastwood's virile hunger to Morricone's iconic score. Everyone and everything here is a purposeful addition to what is inevitably one of THE great films. The interplay between the bounty killers treads that fine line between the light and the heavy heart. That between Mortimer and Indio a simple display of vengeance beautifully layered and represented with the agonisingly tense chimes themselves layered over the harrowing suicide/murder flashbacks. This is how cinema and soundtrack should be done. Perfectly. And the climax, perhaps the greatest in cinema. The showdown. The redemption. The performances. The full realisation of the score. One shot. Sun and blood drenched beauty, an understatement, an overstatement, call it what you will. The effect is undeniable. And has to be seen to be understood.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is tied with "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly", as my all-time favorite western. It's one of several masterpieces put forth by Sergio Leone. I love everything about it- the gorgeous cinematography, the fantastic musical score by Ennio Morricone, the acting, the script, and everything else. It's all top-notch. What more can I say about this movie? Clint Eastwood is of course fantastic, along with Lee Van Cleef, and Gian Maria Volonté who plays the main villain of the movie, El Indio. This movie has a lot of acting without words, lots of watching and waiting, which is typical Sergio Leone Style. There are periods where the camera focuses on the faces of the characters as they watch each other and try to figure out what the other is doing or try to be the first shot in the shootout scenes.This movie is best viewed with your VCR patched into your stereo system or a home theater system, to get the most out of Ennio Morricone's haunting score. And if you've got it on DVD, it would be that much better. Unfortunately this movie came out when I was only about 2 or 3, so I never saw it in the theater, but it must've really made an impression on those who did see it. Watching it on big-screen TV with the sound played through your stereo would be the next best thing. I highly recommend it and I give it a perfect 10 score. Go rent it, or better yet, by it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Often Overlooked, But Still Phenomenal</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When discussing the amazing films of Sergio Leone, the one movie that usually gets lost in the shuffle is `For a Few Dollars More'. This is slightly understandable, since it's just a hair below the impossibly good standards of `The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly' and `Once Upon a Time in the West' (among others), but there's no denying that `For a Few Dollars More' is still a terrific movie in its own right. In fact, if judged on its own merits instead of in comparison to Leone's other works, it's nearly a classic.`For a Few Dollars More' pretty much picks up right where `A Fistful of Dollars' left off ? the Man With No Name (Clint Eastwood), who's now been dubbed `Manco' by a couple of his fellow bounty hunters, is working his way through the Old West, systematically picking off and collecting the reward for despicable criminals and other lowlifes. He's worked his way up to hunting down the most ruthless bandit of them all, Indio (the incredibly underrated Gian Maria Volonté), a depraved killer who's recently escaped from prison. Also on the hunt for Indio, however, is the bounty hunter Colonel Mortimer (Lee Van Cleef), who has a personal score to settle with the killer. The film becomes an interesting three-way game of cat and mouse, as Colonel Mortimer and the Man With No Name struggle to work around (and with) each other, as well as to hunt down Indio, who's decided he's not going to be taken down without a fight.Eastwood's portrayal of The Man With No Name really getting to flourish for the first time in this film ? there's glimpses of it in `A Fistful of Dollars', but this is the first time it becomes apparent how weirdly moral the Man With No Name is. He can be a bloodthirsty, brutal bully at times, but he only acts that way around people he thinks deserve to knocked down a peg or two. To women, children (at least the ones that try to steal from him), and others he considers to be `innocent', the Man With No Name is surprisingly deferential, even kind. There's a lot of complexity to the character, and Eastwood pulls it off with some serious style.Van Cleef is also great as Colonel Mortimer, although it's weird to see him in this film as Mortimer and then in `The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly' as the dastardly Angel Eyes ? the two characters are such complete opposites. Mortimer is a lot like the Man With No Name ? adhering to a strange code of honor, doing heroic things by often unheroic methods. Because of their similarities, the relationship between the two characters is terrific, veering between complete distrust and grudging respect. In a way, `For a Few Dollars' more is one of the first modern `buddy' action movies ? the way Eastwood and Van Cleef interact with each other seems eerily like the predecessor to movies like `Lethal Weapon' and `48 Hours'.Director Sergio Leone does a great job with this film as well ? the initial meeting between The Man With No Name and Colonel Mortimer is appropriately tense, bordering on near film perfection. So are the scenes with Indio and his gang (watch Indio's storytelling explanation about how he plans to rob a bank), as well as the final confrontation between all the characters -- awesome. Leone also uses the score of Ennio Morricone to great effect, using a haunting little tune from Indio's pocket watch to great effect throughout the film. The pacing, the backgrounds, the shot set-ups ? all awesome. Leone's one of the unappreciated film greats of all time.`For a Few Dollars More' is simply a fantastic film; if you haven't already seen this one, rent it immediately. The only reason people don't rave about this as being one of the best Western of all time is because it fell between two cracks of Western perfection: `A Fistful of Dollars' and `The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly'.Grade: A</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Solid Entry In The Trilogy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As with the first of these "Man With No Name" trilogies, I was pleasantly surprised how good these "spaghetti western" films were; better than I had remembered.Both Clint Eastwood and Lee Van Cleef are the English-speaking starring actors in this action-packed oater. Both play bounty hunters; both are tough, smart and great with a gun.The strategy between the two of them - when they join forces - is interesting, and you get the feeling neither one of them trusts the other, so it almost has a film noir-feel to it.Some people think this was the best of the three films. I wouldn't have a problem with that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fine western from Sergio Leone</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'For a Few Dollars More' is the second movie in the "Man With No Name"-trilogy starring Clint Eastwood and directed by Sergio Leone. It is not as good as the first, 'A Fistful of Dollars', but comes close to it. The third, of course, is the masterpiece 'The Good, the Bad and the Ugly'. This trilogy together with 'Once Upon a Time in the West' and 'Once Upon a Time in America' show us how great a director Leone actually is. Although this movie is the least of all I mentioned above it still belongs to the best westerns I have seen.The story is almost as simple as it can be. Two bounty hunters, one played by Clint Eastwood, the other by Lee Van Cleef (who was "the bad" in 'The Good, the Bad and the Ugly'), work together to get an outlaw. They each have their motives, both are not really people you can trust, both are great with their guns.With Leone it is not really what is happening but how it is presented to the viewer. Often shown with close-ups of sweaty faces Leone knows how to create suspense in a gun fight where you can predict the outcome because Eastwood is in it. But not only Leone deserves credit for this movie, or actually the complete trilogy. Eastwood is in his element here and he makes sure the choice of greatest western star is not necessarily John Wayne. Van Cleef, who normally plays real villains, is terrific here as what seems to be a good guy. Another memorable thing is Ennio Morricone's score. Although his most famous scores are from 'The Good, the Bad and the Ugly' and 'Once Upon a Time in the West' he also adds something to the atmosphere in this movie (and of course 'A Fistful of Dollars'). Leone, Morricone and Eastwood have created a great trilogy. With 'For a Few Dollars More' as the least movie but nonetheless a very good one, enough is said.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Since seeing Sergio Leone's superb The Good,The Bad and The Ugly and A Fistful of Dynamite,I've been meaning to take a look at Leone's other Spaghetti Western titles,but for some reason have not got round to picking them up.With a poll for the best titles of 1965 taking place on IMDbs Classic Film board,a fellow IMDber caught me by surprise,when he kindly sent me the second teaming up between Leone and Clint Eastwood that I could watch for the poll,which led to me finally putting some extra dollars in my hands.The plot:Getting a fistful of dollars for killing a target,bounty hunter Colonel Douglas Mortimer spots a wanted poster for El Indio and his ruthless gang of outlaws.Having some personal history with Indio,Mortimer tracks Indio down and sets his sights on taking him and his gang down.Stopping him in his tracks,Indio discovers that a fellow bounty hunter called Manco has also tracked Indio down,and has made plans to collect the bounty on Indio's head.As they try to get on the same page,Mortimer &amp; Manco discover that Indio and his gang are planning to rob the biggest bank in the city.View on the film:Reuniting with Sergio Leone, Ennio Morricone fires a thunderous operatic score across the screen,which also features shrieking Gothic Horror chills which gradually reveals the darkness laying in the characters pasts.Taking on the bounty hunters, Gian Maria Volonté gives a blistering performance as El Indio,with Volonté showing Indio to be a silent menace who runs his gang with an iron fist,which begins to crumble as Indio's fractured mind boils over the raging psychopath. Sticking by Indio, Klaus Kinski gives a terrific performance as Juan Wild.Despite only having limited dialogue,Kinski makes his presence strongly felt across the title,with Kinski's wry smile displaying the terror that Indio and his gang plan to cast across the west.Considering to become a landscape artist before his move to Spaghetti Westerns led to a career revival, Lee Van Cleef gives a mesmerising performance as Col. Douglas Mortimer,with Cleff's stern eyes giving the movie a dry wit,as Mortimer drops the cards from his chest one by one.Holding a deep grudge against Indio,Cleff lights up the film with a burning intensity,thanks to Cleff giving Mortimer a brittleness which brilliantly expresses the severity of Mortimer's hatred for Indio.Walking back into the Spaghetti Western sun,Clint Eastwood gives a fabulous performance as "man with no name" Manco,as Eastwood paints Manco as a tall dark handsome outlaw,whose whip-smart shooting skills are matched by his eagerness to whip up as much cash for the other side as possible.Holding back from fully crossing Indio's gang over with Mortimer and Manco for the first hour,the screenplay by co-writer/(along with Fulvio Morsella/Luciano Vincenzoni/ Sergio Donati &amp; Fernando Di Leo)director Sergio Leone packs each side with their own tensions,with Indio's crumbling brain being joined by Manco keeping an eye out for other outlaws after the wanted dollars. Unleashing explosive battles between the bounty hunters and the gang,the screenwriters give the title an unexpected haunted atmosphere,as the chimes from a watch open up the madness gripping Indio,and the thrust for revenge that is loading up Mortimer's gun.Leaving behind the pseudonym used on his first Spaghetti Western,director Sergio Leone rides onto the Western scene in a blazing, ultra-stylised manner.Closely working with Morricone &amp; cinematographer (and future director) Massimo Dallamano,Leone gives the title a chilling mood,with half faded,overlapping flashbacks opening up the murky events that haunt the characters.Kicking the movie off with an outlaw being shot from a long distance,Leone &amp; Dallamano swoop across the title in a lush,poetic fashion,thanks to each of the tough,gritty gun battles being hit with razor sharp whip- pans,tightly held tracking shots and circling extreme close- ups.Giving the viewer a chance to breath in the rich atmosphere,Leone covers Monco &amp; Mortimer wild west trail in burning yellows and crayon reds which light up as blunt red gunshot wounds open up across the screen,in a film which is defiantly worth a few dollars more.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The middle part of Sergio Leone's dollars trilogy sandwich is a mighty hunk of meat and pasta. Plot has Clint Eastwood and Lee Van Cleef as bounty hunters who form a very uneasy alliance to bring down violent bandit El Indio (Gian Maria Volont?) and his gang.As befitting Leone in this sub-genre, the pic positively oozes charisma and class. His compositions are as striking as the coolness he wrings out from his lead actors, the characterisations bristling with a calm grizzle factor that beguiles as the story jumps from violence to suspense, from humour to misery, with surprises is store as well. The screenplay adheres to some clichés of the Western formula, but never at a cost to suspense and mystery, such as with the finale that looks set to be formulaic, but joyfully brings its own identity whilst simultaneously adding extra layers to the protags and antag. The dialogue (Leone and Luciano Vincenzoni) pings with literacy, something which is a pleasant mercy in the Spaghetti Western world, while Morricone fills the key scenes with aural shards of atmospheric delight.A great film in its own standalone right, but also a super precursor to The Good, the Bad and the Ugly. 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good warm up to "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly,"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Greetings from Lithuania."For a Few Dollars More" (1965) is a really good old western. Made by Sergio Leone this is a spaghetti western so if you have seen some other his movies, you know what you are getting into. The story is kinda simple (as usual for these kind of movies) where two bounty hunters team up to catch the fish of their lives type bandit. And basically that's it. I like Sergio Leone movies for the same reasons i liked "For a Few Dollars More". They are specifically performed (you won't find this acting in "Unforgiven" for example), the set design is always something to look at - there are many details in the backgrounds which helps to create this real place and time and transport you to it. Cinematography is gorgeous. The music is always good, adventurous. The gunfights are OK, these movies again are not "Unforgiven" type gritty reality, they are "fun Westerns" and i like when they for example can shoot the very cigar- end with a revolver - a trick which in reality probably would end up with dudes half of face being blown up. Overall, if you like this stuff, you will like "For a Few Dollars More". Being the second installment in "Dollars" trilogy, it's not as good and epic as the "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly," but it's a very fine genre picture.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Everything that you expected from a western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this films few years after the other Sergio Leone's films in his western Trilogy. This one neither has a strong story like "a fistful of dollars" (which was made based on Kurosawa's "Yojimbo" (1961)) nor was as great as "the good, the bad and the ugly". But it has everything that you expected from a spaghetti western at highest quality. The one thing that made this film memorable is its music by "Ennio Morricone", which I believe is even better than "the good, bad and ugly" music. It goes up and down with the story and is one of the best music film that I have ever heard. Music made this film a memorable classical film.</fullReview>

I thought no other movie could better it and now I have to change my opinions! If the former was a perfect one for entertainment, then this one is perfect in almost everything. Couldn't find any holes. The performance of Clint Eastwood just got better here as the "man with no name" and "the man in black" Cleef is very good in this movie comparing good bad and ugly.The story was succinct, screen-played into a 131 minute epic with no unwanted scenes and with correct detailing in every shot. Thats what I call a must watch one!!As a critic, this one is better. But as a Eastwood fan, good bad ugly still is better and will be my favorite!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>That famous "hat duel" scene in "For a Few Dollars More" is one of my favorites in a Sergio Leone movie, and it's emblematic of the film's tone: dangerous and a lotta fun. Two genre icons showing off their quick-draw precision in a scene that speaks volumes without uttering a single word.And the whole movie rests squarely on the shoulders of these two men, and each makes his own grand entrance; Van Cleef and that scowl just radiates menace, while Eastwood swaggers in like he owns the screen. It's a thrill watching these guys go to work. Everything just clicks with this movie, and for my money, it's the best of the trilogy (the best gunfights, score and overall gritty vibe). It's the movie that comes to mind when I think of Sergio Leone.Fantastic movie.8.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sergio Leone's success continues from A Fistful of Dollars</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is no doubt that Sergio Leone's Dollars trilogy is perhaps the most forgotten trilogy which happens to be absolutely great. I absolutely loved the Good the Bad and the Ugly and very much enjoyed A Fistful of Dollars. I'm glad to say that this film is no disappointment. In fact, I very much enjoyed it more than A Fistful of Dollars. Why? Because Lee Van Cleef was in this movie. To me, he is one of the coolest film characters ever. The story is also more interesting and it really begins to sort of set it up for the final installment where we see all three characters forming alliances with one another. I thought that the musical score was absolutely brilliant as it was in the first film and is in the last one. The acting was just brilliant! Lee Van Cleef and young Clint Eastwood are just phenomenal together! The story is very moving and a lot of fun to watch. The characters are much more interesting in this film than they were in the first. I thought that Douglas Mortimer is one of the most fascinating and badass movie characters ever! The dialogue is very clever and the story is paced in such a way that more than half the movie is spent with character introduction, making the movie very moving! The direction by Sergio Leone was just phenomenal! He really didn't get it wrong on the second installment, like other directors may in other films. This will remain as one of the timeless Spaghetti/Western masterpieces!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of the best films I ever seem and I have seem many. Yes, it is that good: as soon as I saw it the film jumped right near the top of my favorite films list.The reasons for this film greatness are many: the awesome characters, the presence of several high caliber actors which lead to the high level acting, the highly interesting plot and the cynical way which Leone portraits the Old West which contrasts with the more conventional work of John Ford's westerns (which I personally find rather boring) and the high integration between the score and the film: the film score is all around excellent and highly memorable. One knows that he or she is watching something great at the first minute of the film. This is one of the greatest westerns ever made and is among the best films of the 1960's, of any genre. It is also a highly entertaining and accessible film (unlike, for example, the stuff produced by Ingmar Bergman), so it would be a good experience for anyone.Highly recommended for anyone!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One Of The Best Westerns Ever Made During Its Era</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For a Few Dollars More is an Italian spaghetti western film directed by Sergio Leone.It features starring Clint Eastwood, Lee Van Cleef,Gian Maria Volonté and German actor Klaus Kinski,who plays a supporting role as a secondary villain. This pulse-pounding follow-up to Sergio Leone's A Fistful of Dollars brings back Eastwood as the serape-clad, cigar-chewing "Man With No Name" which happens to be the second part of what is commonly known as the Dollars Trilogy.This film would be followed by the last and best of the Man with No Name trilogy, The Good, the Bad and the Ugly.Engaged in an ongoing battle with bounty hunter Col. Douglas Mortimer, the Man joins forces with his enemy to capture homicidal bandit Indio. Both characters are given understandable motivations for their bloodletting tendencies, something that was lacking in A Fistful of Dollars,the first film of the trilogy. The violence is raw and uninhibited and in many ways, curiously poetic. Leone's tense, tight close-ups, pregnant pauses, and significant silences have since been absorbed into the standard spaghetti Western lexicon; likewise, Ennio Morricone's haunting musical score has been endlessly imitated and parodied.Lean, mean, atmospheric and blackly comic spaghetti western by the team who all but invented the genre, well deserving of its reputation as one of the era's very best.Overall,it is a gloriously greasy, sweaty, hairy, bloody and violent Western that one could truly enjoy viewing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Fans of Quentin Taratino need to watch the Sergio Leone trilogy: Fistful of Dollars, For a few Dollars More, and The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly to see what inspired him to the achievements he has made as a director.Fans of Clint Eastwood need no encouragement to see him in his early work on his way to stardom.Eastwood and Lee Van Cleef are bounty hunters on the trail of El Indio (Gian Maria Volont?). Eastwood is out for the money, but Van Cleef has other motives. Bullets fly, bodies are stacked like cord wood, and the action never stops all to incredible music by Ennio Morricone.Enjoy!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The most underrated but the best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Why this is has never been held in the same "classic" status as A Fistful of Dollars and The Good,The Bad and The Ugly is anyone,s guess. This is director Sergio Leone,s true masterpiece of the trilogy. More stylish and ambitious than the first,but not as overlong or pretentious as the third.It,s the greatest spaghetti western ever made.Clint Eastwood,s second performance as The Man with No Name sees him team up with ageing gunslinger Lee Van Cleef to bring down psychotic Gian Maria Volonte (one of cinema,s most evil villains) and his gang. The plot is cynical and brilliant,the stark imagery is perfect and Ennio Morricone,s score is my favourite.What always surprised me about Good/Bad/Ugly was how underwritten Eastwood and Van Cleef,s parts were.Basically the film was about Tuco.But in this film,Leone actually seems equally interested in all three of the main characters and brilliantly fleshes them out.Eastwood was always meant to be quiet and mysterious,but in this,you get a sense of his personality and purpose,unlike the third,where he came across a bit bored,which he probably was by that time. And Van Cleef was a great addition to the film.Although I,m not usually a fan of his,he was great here in his most sympathetic role as the haunted army veteran. Together the two formed one of cinema,s greatest partnerships.Their stony eyed double act is a joy throughout,especially in the sequence where they shoot at each other,s hats in the street. Leone even put some thought into Volonte,s role.As Indio,he is not a cardboard villain.He is sadistic,psychotic,treacherous to his own men and (dare I say it)even almost human in sequences where he flashes back to a despicable act he,s committed.The first 30 minutes of the film are riveting,showing the main characters in unrelated incidents before the strands twists together for the main story,which is never short of suspenseful,involving and enjoyable.It combines black humour,melancholic moments and great shootouts that all build up to an unforgettable climax and tops off my favourite Leone film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The template Spaghetti Western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The second film in Sergio Leone's 'Dollars Trilogy' is a definite progression from A Fistful of Dollars. Utilizing many of the same cast members, Leone's follow up is more layered and stylised than before. It was the most successful Italian film of its time and remained so into the early 70's. For this reason its probably fair to say that more than any other movie, this was the definitive template of the Spaghetti Western genre. Its story of mean bad guys and mean good guys entwined in a revenge plot was mimicked several times in other Italian movies. Leone, however, was the master of this sub-genre and in this film he begins to really show why. It's paced magnificently and is consistently visually arresting. It exhibits many of the director's recurring imagery - extreme close-ups, scenes of operatic violence and an eye for interesting faces. But of course, this is only part of the story because what would these films be without the contribution of Ennio Morricone? The soundtrack maestro is once again on peerless form and the score is quite brilliant. It's unthinkable to imagine Leone's films without the contribution of this musical genius. Similarly, the cast add good value. Clint Eastwood is a solid presence but he is overshadowed by Lee Van Cleef as Colonel Douglas Mortimer ? despite being top billed Eastwood often essentially played second fiddle to his co-star, think also of Eli Wallach in The Good, the Bad and the Ugly. The villains are also very good too. Gian Maria Volonté is always compelling as the chief psychopath, what with his mixture of physical menace and psychological damage. But perhaps best of all is Klaus Kinski as the unforgettable hunchback bandit. He is criminally under used, however.For a Few Dollars More is not quite up to the standard of Leone's two masterpieces that followed it ? The Good, the Bad and the Ugly and Once Upon a Time in the West ? but it remains an awesome western nevertheless, and perhaps the best place for a novice to start when first dipping into the joys that constitute the Spaghetti Western genre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stylish , violent , laconic Western and very well shot by the great Leone</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's the second installment of the ¨Dollars trilogy¨ along with ¨ For a handful of dollars¨ and ¨The good ,the bad and the ugly¨ with Eastwood as ¨Man with no name¨. The epitome of the SW is violent, beautifully crafted and exaggerated , it pits crafty ¨Man with no name¨ though named Manco (Clint Eastwood) and shifty Colonel Mortimer (Lee Van Cleef as old man , however in reality Clint was already 35 and Lee only 40 when was filmed ) forming an uneasy alliance against badder guy named Indio (Gian Maria Volonte ) but their reasons to pursuit him are totally different . The bounty hunter gunslingers reluctantly join forces pitting the psychotic outlaw who uses twisted means to chase them and terminates in a deadly feud. ¨Man with no name¨ is helped by the old prophet (Joseph Egger who also appeared as gravedigger in For a handful of dollars).This classic original Western contains slow and deliberating filming , taciturn acting on cynical characters, sense of style , elaborate shoot-outs , and portentous close-ups of grime-encrustred faces with bloodbaths including high body-count as total kill count: 30, though two of the murders were heard, but not shown . Unforgettable scenes as when Lee Van Cleef fires a match on the back of the hunchback Klaus Kinski , the spectacular final duel , and many others . The impact of this Spaghetti opened the gate for the huge numbers of Italian-Spaniard Western which made fortune for their producers and directors in the sixties and early seventies . The trilogy made Eastwood an international star previously better-known for his running character in TV series ¨Rawhide¨. Leone did revive his career almost instantly on the strength of these films . All of Eastwood's later Western and his ¨Dirty Harry¨ movies owe a considerable debt to Leone. Furthermore appear Leone's habitual secondaries acting as ominous hoodlums such as Mario Brega , Benito Stefanelli , Aldo Sambrell , Antonio Molino Rojo, Lorenzo Robledo, Jose Canalejas , Frank Bra?a , among them.Ennio Morricone's musical score is terrific with sensational compositions blending human voice, guitar and buzzing harmonica, the atonal soundtrack has been imitated and copied thousand times . Excellent production design by Carlo Simi , Leone's usual and cinematography by Massimo Dallamano is fascinating . ¨For a few dollars more ¨was filmed in acceptable budget during several weeks in location on austere outdoors of Golden City (Sierra of Madrid), Hoyo De Manzanares , Colmenar Viejo, Madrid , and Almeria : Albaricoques and Tabernas ; besides interiors located on Cinecitta Roman studios . This quintessential 'Spaguetti' originated great influence of wide range in Western and changed the face of the genre . It was such a good picture that had a great success , it expanded in a flood of Italian/Spanish Westerns, but none hold a candle to Leone's masterpiece . The ¨trilogy of the dollars ¨ is followed by ¨ Once upon a time in West¨and ¨Duck you sucker¨. For Leone enthusiasts with his usual trademarks , it's full of which made his films so memorable, others might find it a bit long but no one can deny its sense of style what achieved a great burst of world-wide popularity .</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Man with No Name or Manco returns in "for a few dollars more" the sequel to the Italo-Western success "a fistful of dollars". I must say I liked this movie even better than it's predecessor, and I really liked it's predecessor. now Clint Eastwood's character "the man with no name" is a timeless character, the only flaw of the first movie being that it was only about him. In this movie we get a triple storyline. Lee Van Cleef stars as Colonel Douglas Mortimer a bounty killer (another name for bounty hunter) who get's in the way of "the man with no name" and they decide to team up. They're both after the escaped criminal "El Indio" played by Gian Maria Volont?, who has the third part of the storyline. I honestly had to check if I hadn't accidentally turned on the sequel "the good, the bad and the ugly" when I saw this film.There are really no flaws in this movie, it has obviously dated a lot being from 1965, having some cheesy music once in a while, and some poor dubbing. But considering it's time I really don't see that as a negative.The acting is great and the story is wonderful. Action, but not to much action. Dialogue but not to much dialogue. the movie is perfectly balanced. Also it's almost forty minutes longer than the prequel, yet the prequel felt a lot slower than this movie. Adding the extra character to this movie was a great idea, and I look forward to seeing Lee Van Cleef in the sequel.This movie is a true Western classic, it's Sergio Leone at his best. And "the man with no name" is a truly unforgettable character. i give this movie a 10/10.</fullReview>

Gian Maria Volont? is thoroughly brutal and cruel. All three show us a perfect professionalism and are equally attractive, and the equilibrium of these three actors keep us thrilled and excited to the end. The land is vast, the sky is blue and the mountains are steep. Ennio Morricone's music is a perfect match to this film, and the opening whistle melody echoes in the head even after finishing the film. Clint Eastwood is now a giant actor, producer and director in front of us, but we should never forget his starting point as an actor such as in this film, which impresses us for good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A worthwhile Western--for a few dollars less, to boot!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Clint Eastwood's "spaghetti western" trilogy with Italian director Sergio Leone stacks up well against other top director groupings of film classics such was Francis Ford Coppola's THE GODFATHER trilogy, Akira Kurosawa's epics of feudal Japan (think RAN), or British helmsman David Lean's series of war-time stunners beginning with THE BRIDGE ON THE RIVER KWAI. What these films share are strong characterizations, unhurried pacing, unpredictable developments, a "playing for keeps" mentality, and well-built suspense.FOR A FEW DOLLARS MORE is filled with nail-biting duels, sudden explosions, swiftly shifting crosses and double- or triple-crosses, and gallows humor. Simple things such as an apple tree and a musical gold watch determine the fates of several dozen (mostly bad)men. Women are few and far between, as this version of the post-Civil War American West is a man's world.With the help of composer Ennio Morricone's indelible scoring, FOR A FEW DOLLARS MORE deserves its ranking among the 250 most popular movies of all time. And, if you saw it during its initial U.S. cinema run, you probably did so "for a few dollars less" than any of your recent trips to the show!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An epic film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Call me mentally insane, or send me to the looney bin, but I actually preferred this film over The Good, The Bad, And The Ugly. GBAD was a great film, but it seemed just a little too extended and long for me.Films don't get much better than the ones with Eastwood in his prime, and this was no exception. And Lee Van Cleef? AMAZING acting. He was perfect for the job of playing Mortimer. The acting was great, and the dialogue was sharp and witty. This film also had the perfect length. 130 minutes was not too long, nor too short. It was just the amount of time to tell the story of how The Man With No Name finally managed to track down the notorious outlaw known as Indio along with some help from Mortimer, and it all leads up very nicely to the final duel with Indio and his gang of outlaws, but it wasn't just any old western shootout. The Man With No Name shows his gunslinging savvy by managing to shoot down all of Indio's henchmen while leaving Indio alive for a mano-a-mano showdown. And the way Eastwood's character wins is absolutely brilliant, although I won't give any further spoilers.The bottom line is- You don't have to be a fan of westerns to enjoy this film. No matter what genre you seem to dwell in, you should get plenty of enjoyment out of this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fine Western from the supreme Western stylist</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An exemplar movie, making rules as it goes along, creating legendary scenes and characters. Above all it's very entertaining, full of humour and grand drama. This is due, in no small part of course, to the indelible score of Ennio Morricone whose whistling and jaws-harp thematics are the most pungent since Anton Karas' zither in Carol Reed's Third Man. The music itself is also a triumph of economy and occasional operatic gesture.I actually remember Van Kleef and Eastwood's performances being better than they are, but then I last saw the film when I was 10... Gian Maria Volont?'s El Indio is the supreme performance, an imperious bandit who shows madness and piteousness in equal measure. Never just simply 'the bad guy'. I also love the minor roles, particularly the striking reveal of José Terrón (Calloway) with his skeletal features and Morricone's surreal music. 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Leone's best movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Perhaps most of you fair readers have already seen FOR A FEW ? yet I would have been pleased to introduce some of you to this quintessential western. There is a form of joy in this movie, a cordiality, a sharpness also. Nowadays?and in fact for some time now?we know that the '60s were another golden age of the westerns. FOR A FEW ? is the western to which the theories about Leone's irony and subversion and deconstruction are the least relevant. The whistled score seems almost the gist of the movie; here Leone means rather more melodrama (than usual) and less irony. Since it's the best movie of the triptych, it's also Clint Eastwood's best deal, yet the master of the sets is Van Cleef?cool, handsome, sharp, thoughtful. But I say something more for my intro?in a way, FOR A FEW ? seems not only the most melodramatic Leone western?but the most genuinely surreal as well. This, if you have the same notion of surrealism, of surrealism in cinema, that I do?and that Leone also seemed to have. Almost discretely eerie, and melodramatically eerie. Two bounty hunters, Monco and Mortimer both face a band of bandits headed by a character performed with a nearly Shakeaspearean twist. One notices some symmetry?Volonté and Kinski bring an European approach, highly picturesque roles?while both Eastwood and Van Cleef give cool approaches. For me, THE GOOD ?, that is the next installment of the triptych, was a bit self?aware; slightly self?aware, though certainly not enough to spoil the fun ?. The Monco installment is more melodramatic, more touching?the score, the story, the actors ?--and less ironic than its successor. Of course they're both high ranking westerns; when I have seen FOR A FEW DOLLARS MORE for the first time, I wholeheartedly proclaimed it the best western ever ,and largely commented upon Van Cleef, his coolness, Kinski and Volonté's performance. The hats scene is memorable; so are the breasts of Mortimer's sister (on this, see an anatomic note infra). This one is the unequaled and even unrivaled great Leone movie for this writer; western?wise, it has nearly everything on its side, it has Van Cleef, Volonté and Kinski, Van Cleef lives his big moment and is in awesome shape, fine beyond belief and is much cooler than Eastwood. In fact, the script itself favors greatly Van Cleef over Eastwood. Monco is, no doubt, cool, and a slick executioner; Mortimer is finer. In terms of score and melodrama ,this Leone epic surpasses everything. That Volonté released Eastwood and Van Cleef?for a wholly absurd reason?I find it unreasonable and unconvincing, but the movie is good regardless. Mortimer's sister is showed naked twice; I can swear that the actress is not the same in the two scenes?her breasts are different?the nipples differ?there are two different pairs of tits?in the 1st scene they are thin nipples, in the second, very puffy, delicious nipples.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The near perfect western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Where life had no value, death, sometimes, had its price. That is why the bounty killers appeared."These are the famous words that greet the viewer at the start of "For A Few Dollars More". The Follow up to Sergio Leone" A Fist Full Of Dollars". The first film , although groundbreaking , had many Faults. The good thing is , that with the follow up , Leone seems to have ironed out the glitches and has produced a near perfect Western.Eastwood is a keen-eyed, quick-witted bounty hunter on the bloody trail of Indio, the territory's most treacherous bandit. But his ruthless rival, Colonel Mortimer , is determined to bring Indio in first...dead or alive! Failing to capture their prey - or eliminate each other - the two are left with only one option: team up, or face certain death at the hands of Indio and his band of murderous outlaws.It's very important when making a western to have characters that you love and hate. Heroes and Villains. With the original film there was Clint Eastwood " The man with no name" and he was the only one with any personality to speak off.With this film we are introduced to not only Eastwood's character again but Col. Douglas Mortimer (Lee Van Cleef ) and El Indio ( Gian Maria Volont?) . One a suave looking stranger and sharp shooter who has a score to settle and the other a ruthless bandit who is tortured by his evil past.Talking of Scores , the music is amazing . The haunting sound of that electric guitar is a constant companion and is one of the most iconic scores in movie history.Lee Van Cleef for me is the star of the film. His addition is a stroke of genius of Leone's part. The director also added quite a lot of humour to the film which the first definitely lacked.There are so many great scenes in this movie but my favourite has to be the stand off at the end. When El Indio says to the Colonel "When the chimes end, pick up your gun." Go ahead and shoot me Colonel. Just try." He opens up that pocket watch and the chimes that have troubled both men for years , start . You know there is only going to be one winner.My favourite Western of all time has always been" The Magnificent Seven" but now there is a clear contender for that title.I will be reviewing the final film in the trilogy " The Good the Bad and The Ugly" very soon and if it's true what they say that this is the best of the three , then i cant wait!9 out 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Even better than his first groundbreaking Western, Sergio Leone does himself one better in this second film of his Man With No Name "trilogy." In this story, Eastwood conquers the screen as a bounty hunter known as Monco, who finds himself in deals with another named Colonel Mortimer who has a secret agenda for completing this mission. As these two titans of terror combine their powers, the stage is set for one of the most breathtaking, operatic, and violent showdowns in the Western genre.As I said before, director Leone does wonders with this new-found style he uses in these spaghetti westerns as he sets up each scene and does it with such grace and perfect execution, you can't help but be amazed. With so many intense close-ups, fast-paced editing, and dizzying flashbacks, the story is crystal-clear and even brings out the best in the actors who are great nevertheless. Eastwood is so perfect in this role it's no wonder he became an icon; and Lee Van Cleef also does great as the Colonel. Maybe the best performance belongs to Gian Maria Volonte as the drug-induced, crazy villain El Indio. All these great actors, the superb storyline and the beautiful landscape combine to make this one of the best Westerns, if not one of the best films of all time. This is a timeless and exciting piece of work that will never lose its flavor.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A Fistful of Dollars was merely the warm up, For a Few Dollars More quickly followed and raised the bar even further. Shot in 1965, but not released in the US until may of 1967, it was already the biggest box office hit in Italy's history by the time it was finally released here. Countless Italian westerns followed in For a Few Dollars More's wake, none of them came close to matching Sergio Leone's work.For a Few Dollars More has so many memorable shots and scenes that i'd be writing for days if i listed them all here. Personally i tend to refer to this one as "the one where Lee Van Cleef lights a match using Klaus Kinski's neck". Even though Eastwood gets top billing, he actually doesn't do a whole lot, instead he sits on the sidelines, giving most of the spotlight to Van Cleef. And in the climax, he literally does just that.Ennio Morricone's score is as classic as they come. Once you hear it, you remember it forever. I remember hearing my dad do the unforgettable whistling "music" from the film when i was a kid.For a Few Dollars More is quite simply one of the best westerns of all time. But then again, everyone already knows that. The best part of all, is that Sergio Leone was not done yet, he still wanted to raise the bar even further with a few more westerns.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For a Few Dollars More seldom gets the praise it deserves. Moviegoers mention A Fistful of Dollars, which started it all, The Good, the Bad and the Ugly, on the short list of the best movies ever made, elegiac Once Upon a Time in the West, even the more political entry Duck, You Sucker, and Leone's venture in another genre, Once Upon a Time in America; but FAFDM almost seems forgotten at times. Which is a shame, because it's sheer brilliance.The opening is pure Leone, with his classic introductory vignettes: we meet two bounty hunters, Manco (Clint Eastwood), who favours a down and dirty approach, facing a bandit in a saloon and gunning down his henchmen, and methodical Col. Mortimer, who calmly chooses a weapon to shoot a fugitive from an impossible distance. Then we are introduced to Indio (Gian Maria Volont?), a borderline psycho bandit. Manco and Mortimer team up to kill Indio and his men; the older man has a personal vendetta against the criminal.This movie oozes class. From the scene of Clint walking into a town under a light rain to the final duel, everything is filmed with flair and elegance. Eastwood is an unflappable icon of charisma. Volont? plays Indio as a nasty piece of work who is also smart, and dangerous. Van Cleef is magnificent as Mortimer; it's interesting how, in two movies of the Dollars Trilogy, the Man with No Name is the lead, but the emotional compass of the film is another character (Tuco in TGTBTU, Mortimer here).The final scene is fantastic - Leone has rarely done better. A milestone of westerns.9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Usually in the rules of the cinema world, sequels are inferior to originals. But not in the "Dollars" trilogy's case.For a Few Dollars More is what I believe a superior film to Fistful of Dollars. Fistul was good, but this movie was just better.Our hero, "Monco" (Clint Eastwood) is a bounty killer, living off the money he makes from bringing down the wanted. Soon enough, he comes across a big catch: the infamous "El Indio" (Gian Maria Volonte, who played Ramon Rojo in the previous film). However, this time Monco has a rival, another bounty killer with skills matching his. Colonel Douglas Mortimer (Lee Van Cleef). Soon they must band together to take down El Indio and his gang before Indio gets them.Mortimer was a very interesting addition to the film I believe. He was cool, laid back, like the Man with No Name, only Mortimer was much more sophisticated. It was fun to watch him be like Monco only more fancy.Overall, this film is better than Fistful of Dollars. Fans of the first will find this a real treat.10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Undisputed Sergio Leone Classic!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sergio Leone's superlative "For a Few Dollars More" with Clint Eastwood, Lee Van Cleef, and Gian Maria Volonte ranks in the top five of all Spaghetti westerns. This exciting bounty hunter shoot'em up has Monco (Clint Eastwood) forming an uneasy alliance with Carolina-bred Colonel Douglas Mortimer (Lee Van Cleef) to wipe out a ruthless gang of murderous desperadoes. Monco wants the bounty on El Indio (Gian Maria Volonte of "A Bullet for the General") and his gang, while Colonel Mortimer vows to kill Indio strictly out of revenge. It seems that Indio tried to rape Mortimer' sister and she shot herself with Indio's revolver. A multitude of distinctive Leone touches appear in this fabulous frontier saga; this represents the first time that Leone would stage a gunfight in the round. Meanwhile, Ennio Morricone's theme music is classic with its chiming bells, piercing whistles, and crisp sounding cracks of a whip, but it is the tender and moving watch-piece theme that is really memorable here. Again, the action takes place in the craggy mountainous regions of Spain that substitute marvelously for the American southwest. Every time that a six-gun toting character tramps the gritty earth with his jingling, spur-clad boots, you can hear the scratchy sound of dirt being displaced. The sets seem so much more authentic the way that they have been grafted to the spartan scenery.The opening words on screen establish "For a Few Dollars More" as a bounty hunting oater: "Where life has no value, death sometimes has its price. This is why the bounty hunters appeared." Clint Eastwood returns as the monosyllabic gunman dressed in a serape, with wrist-bands, and a Colt's .45 revolver with a coiled snake on the plow handle grip. More than Eastwood's stoic performance, it is Lee Van Cleef's formidable presence as a natty stranger who carries an arsenal of weapons on his horse that makes this western stand out. Originally, Leone had sought the services of Lee Marvin. Marvin would have been exemplary, but veteran western heavy Lee Van Cleef made the character of the Colonel into one of his most memorable roles. Later, Van Cleef would stretch the Colonel character a bit farther in Gianfranco Parolini's exciting saga "Sabata." As the pot-smoking villain, Gian Maria Volonte challenges both men at every turn of the plot. Volonte looks like the equivalent of a crazed wolf with his lupine features and grizzled hair. There is a psychotic glint in his eyes that make you believe that he prefers to shoot first and ask questions later. Everybody here looks like a mutant, especially Klaus Kinski as a killer with a hunchback. Leone characterizes each character with an Ennio Morricone motif.The action this time around has El Indio's band of killers breaking him out of prison. Coincidentally, Indio shares his cell with a carpenter who knows a thing or two about the safe at the Bank of El Paso. El Indio (Gian Maria Volonte of "Investigation of a Citizen Above Suspicion")and his gunmen kill all the uniformed prison guards and Indio shoots the warden. Later,Indio arranges to rob a bank. Monco and Colonel Mortimer arrive in town at the same time. They agree to work together but neither truly trusts the other. Earlier, they spent an evening shooting at each other's hats that stalled into a stand-off. Monco shot at Mortimer's hat and the hat skidded past Mortimer. Comparatively, Mortimer blows Monco's hat off his head and continues to shoot at it in the air. The bank hold-up itself differs from most westerns of the day. After they blast a hole in the rear of the bank, the bandits take the entire safe, something that would be imitated in "Sabata," and haul it off in a wagon. Mortimer worms his way into the gang because he claims that he can open it with nitro after the villains cannot blast it open without destroying the bank notes. Meanwhile, Monco infiltrates the gang by breaking El Indio's right-hand man Sancho Perez (Panos Papadopoulos) out of prison. Each shoot out is terrifically staged and the gunshots themselves are nothing like the American equivalent. The final shoot-out in the round with the chimes on the watch serving as the timing device is imaginative. "For a Few Dollars More" is better than both "A Fistful of Dollars" and "The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly." British spaghetti western expert Christopher Frayling has written an excellent book about this movie and its shattering impact on American westerns as well as Italian westerns.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Manco" the one-handed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In this "Man With No Name" movie, Eastwood's character is identified by the sheriff who pays Van Cleef his bounty money as "Manco" - or "sleeve" in Spanish.Note that when Eastwood goes into the tavern after Baby Cavanaugh, he does all his fisticuffs with his left hand only, leaving his gun hand, the right hand, always free. He even deals the draw poker hand entirely with his left hand. This is probably how he got his nickname of "sleeve." (In French, "La Manche," or "sleeve" is the English Channel.)IMHO, this is the best of the "Man With No Name" trilogy. The scene following the macho confrontation in the dark street, observed by the three muchachos from under the boardwalk, is classic, even though the third reason somehow never gets brought up. Van Cleef is an underrated actor and is at least as good as Eastwood (IMHO) in this film."Let's drink to this partnership - with no tricks."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Leone's intoxicating western masterpiece 10/10....Tarantino's Inspiration in a nutshell</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Where life had no value, death, sometimes, had its price. That is why the bounty killers appeared"This is a brutal and pervasively amazing classic brought to us from the western maestro Sergio Leone.He has served us with a smorgasbord of guns, money, greed, betrayal, friendship and of course Clint Eastwood.Clint plays the infamous man with no name in which he drifts from town to town collecting bounties and making a good living out of it. But a new bounty bigger than ever has come around. Indio....for 10,000 dollars, a bounty of a life time.But there is a challenger facing the man with no name and that is Colonel Mortimer played by the fabulous Lee Van Cleef. Mortimer is more seasoned and experienced than the man with no name. But there is one thing they both want...the bounty money but they know they cant get it alone. They choose to make a partnership with a mission to get the bounty money. One on the inside of Indio's gang and one on the outside. The mood is set, the mission is set, the showdown is set for one of the greatest narratives ever shown in western history and even movie history.As mentioned in the summary line, this series is the cornerstone of the Quentin Tarantino's inspiration. He quoted that the good the bad and the ugly was the greatest directed film ever made. You can tell from films such as Kill Bill that he was heavily inspired by this classic series of westerns. He uses cinematography that would definitely replicate spaghetti western films. If your a big QT fan then you'll absolutely LOVE this movie.Even if your not you'll still love it!Not only is this the best in the series of spaghetti westerns, its also a major milestone of modern cinema and should be remembered as one of Eastwood's best films.This is rather under-rated and i believe its better than the good the bad and the ugly.10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Did you expected anything less from a Sergio Leone western?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a typical Sergio Leone western, with a style that made the spaghetti western one of THE genres of the '60's and redefined the western genre in general. "Per qualche dollaro in pi?" is the middle movie of the 'Dollar'-trilogy and although its not the best out of the trilogy it's of course still better than just your average kind of western!It's a movie that's solidly written, with also some fine solid characters in it. But it of course is the directing and story-telling style of Sergio Leone that makes the movie work out so well. He takes his time to build up sequences and its excitement. This movie is really not halve as action filled as you perhaps would expect but it still is at least halve more exciting than most other westerns with lots of action in it. This says something about the effective directing approach of Leone. Of course his trademarks elements such as extreme close-ups of eyes, flashbacks, slow storytelling, gritty atmosphere and stand-offs are all present here.Lee Van Cleef plays one of his very best roles. Gian Maria Volont? also did a really good job at playing the movie its real main villain, although of course I still prefer Eli Wallach. And Clint Eastwood does what he can do best in this movie; playing one tough but righteous character. It was also quite nice to see Klaus Kinski in this one!And of course you can't get around Ennio Morricone's musical score. Wasn't he one of the first ever composes to give each character a main theme and motive throughout the movie, that gets featured prominently? His score for this movie is just great and it above all really serves a purpose within the movie, which makes the score really suit the movie its story as well as the overall atmosphere.It's a movie that just gets better and better toward the ending, until it gets to its unavoidable stand-off sequence at the end, that is really exciting and memorable, once again not in the least thanks to Morricone's musical score, that actually plays a real important part during the sequence.In my opinion this movie gets nowhere close to the brilliance of "Il Buono, il brutto, il cattivo", which is the 'follow-up' of this movie and the last part of the trilogy, but that of course doesn't mean that this movie is a bad one! Not at all!8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A classic among classics.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Very few trilogies spark as much controversy as to which installment is the better than the "Man With No Name" movies. These movies not only started a genre(spaghetti westerns) but set a template as to how a great soundtrack can compliment a film rather well. Ennio Morricone is without a doubt, one of the greatest composers that ever decided to write scores for films. I'm not going to go into the plot of the movie for I find myself quite annoyed when I read a comment under movies that has everything short of the script written on them. But film fans and film students alike can really benefit from these films, especially For a Few Dollars More since it is arguably the best one. I personally like The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly best but For a Few Dollars More is probably the best one. This film has it all. Visuals, Leone's staple face close-ups, quirky one- -liners, and a soundtrack that will knock your socks off. Leone is a legend and a reminder that film DOES exist outside Hollywood.</fullReview>

You have the lead character who is a bounty hunter,he is not a perfect role model far from it but forget all that he kills bad people! You have another bounty hunter now he is a good man with even better reasons to kill criminals you can root for him with no feeling of guilt. Then you have the baddies and especially one who is both evil and mentally deranged on top of this is a superb soundtrack brilliant flowing direction from Leone at his absolute best and great locations,the only reason I don't give this film top marks is because I'm not stupid enough to realise that this film is really only aimed at fifty percent of the population!</fullReview>

The plot was better, and more interesting, though the film was slightly too long for my liking. The chemistry between Clint Eastwood and Lee Van Cleef was fantastic to watch, but the thing I enjoyed most about this film was the villain. This character was wonderfully realised as a sadistic maniac who was thrilling to watch. The film was surprisingly emotional, especially the scenes involving the villain and the musical locket. It was more thrilling, more interesting and more engaging than it's predecessor, and some scenes in particular took my breath away.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While not nearly as good as Leone's next two films, "For a Few Dollars More" is one of the best westerns ever made. It combines a superb atmosphere (usual of Leone) and interesting characters. While its not as good as "The Good, the Bad, &amp; the Ugly", I've always felt that "For a Few Dollars More" had the most interesting characterization of the Man with no Name. I'm one of the people who is convinced Eastwood is playing the same character in every film in the trilogy, which is something that has been endlessly debated by fans. Even better than Eastwood however is Lee Van Cleef. Van Cleef was even cooler and more charismatic than Eastwood, but he never went onto become the international star that Clint did. He was unfortunately neglected to starring roles in b-pictures and the occasional supporting part in b-films. However, hes one of the few actors that can make even the worst film worth watching.There are a few very minor flaws to the film. For one, the pacing is a bit slow and draggy. The film could've been trimmed of about twenty minutes without losing much of its impact. Despite being at least thirty minutes longer, "The Good, the Bad, &amp; the Ugly" never had this problem. Still, by the time the film is over it doesn't matter too much. In addition to the two fantastic star roles, the supporting cast is very good also. The villains are sadistic as hell, with Klaus Kinski being a standout (the "If it isn't the smoker" scene is an absolute classic). Fans of Kinski are advised to check out the spaghetti western "The Great Silence". Overall, this is easily one of the finest spaghetti westerns ever made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A terrific film--one of the best of the Italian Westerns</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film begins as you see Lee Van Cleef tracking down and killing wanted men. He is so cold, calculating and non-emotional that he is perhaps one of the creepiest heroes in Westerns. Then, the action switches to Eastwood--doing pretty much the same thing, though with a bit more bravado and a little less menace. Both men are bounty hunters and apparently are nearly unstoppable. Then, the film switches to a prison break, where "El Loco" is being extracted as his gang wipes out almost everyone in the prison.Well, El Loco has a $10,000 bounty and each of his men have bounties as well, so both Van Cleef and Eastwood head to El Paso, as they assume his gang can't resist attacking the richest bank in the West. However, shortly after our bounty hunters arrive, they discover the other is there for the same reason. So, instead of killing each other (which it sure looks like they might do), they decide to team up and split the reward money. However, down deep they both seem pretty foolish as they seem to want to take on the murderous gang alone and not split the money! The plan is for Eastwood to infiltrate the gang while Van Cleef attacks. This seems reasonable, as one of the gang members (the ever-handsome Klaus Kinski) knows Van Cleef. To infiltrate them, Eastwood "stretches the law a bit" by breaking one of El Loco's buddy's out of prison. Because they seem to trust him, Eastwood is sent with a few guys to divert the El Paso authorities to a fake robbery in another town. Eastwood does this but then kills the gang members with him. You see, Eastwood doesn't want the sheriff and his men on hand to get the reward! Unfortunately, the robbery does NOT occur the way Van Cleef and Easatwood reason it would, and El Loco and the surviving gang members escape with the money. It's actually nice to see this because up until now, the two have looked invincible. So, Eastwood re-joins the gang and Van Cleef follows. Once again, it seems very uncertain if these two really are a team or out to trick the other out of the reward. It's obvious that Eastwood's sole motivator is money, whereas Van Cleef's is only revealed at the end of the film.Eastwood AND Van Cleef both infiltrate the gang (after Van Cleef kills Kinski to prevent him from talking). All seems to be going well and the two guys are waiting for their chance to pick them off one by one and return the stolen money to El Paso. However, it turns out that the incredibly sadistic El Loco is quite the schemer and knows the two are bounty hunters. So, the gang beats the stuffing out of the duo (though only a short time later they look just fine!) and tie them up and place a guard on them. However, El Loco is a major jerk and plans on killing off most of the gang and keeping the money for himself. So, he arranges for Eastwood and Van Cleef's escape (this is a really DUMB plan and a big shortcoming in the story). He reasons that the gang and the bounty hunters will wipe each other out as El Loco and his friend escape with the dough.Unfortunately for El Loco, the gang is quickly wiped out and he is face-to-face with Van Cleef at the end of the film. Van Cleef shoots him but the wound is not fatal and El Loco's shot knocks away Van Cleef's gun! This leads to El Loco's trademark--he has a shoot out with his opponent which is to begin the second his pocket watch stops playing music. Well, just before the music stops, Eastwood shows up and saves Van Cleef's life--allowing him to retrieve his gun. It turns out Van Cleef had an identical watch to El Loco's because many years earlier El Loco had murdered Van Cleef's sister and brother-in-law! So, Eastwood being a cool guy and all, lets Van Cleef have the honor of killing El Loco in the gun fight. Van Cleef is so thrilled that Eastwood gave him a chance for revenge that he decides that he doesn't want the money and tells Eastwood he can have all the reward money. The final shot is of Eastwood stacking up all the MANY bodies and figuring how much money he will have earned. The dollar amount isn't quite right and he quickly spins around to waste the one surviving bad guy who just came out of hiding--telling Van Cleef he must have either miscounted or forgot to kill one of them! Now that I've given a pretty thorough overview of the film, let's talk about what I liked. The music is classic spaghetti Western music--over-the-top and really, really cool! The villains are pure evil and fun to watch. The good guys are also pretty scary and fun to watch. But what I liked most about the film was its sense of humor (despite being a very violent film). The scene where Eastwood is talking to the crazy old man in the shack is wonderful and so are several little vignettes spaced throughout the film. The not-quite-a-prequel to this film, A FIST FULL OF DOLLARS was based on Kurosawa's Yogimbo and Sanjuro--and in this film, humor was also occasionally used to break the violence and tension extremely well. One final note is about the performances of Klaus Kinski and Van Cleef. I was absolutely amazed at Kinski's facial expressions--as he was able to make his face tick violently when he was scared. This was amazing and I doubt many people could do this. As for Van Cleef, I really think he stole the show in the film despite Eastwood being so strongly associated with the film. He was truly menacing and the focal point for much of the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spaghetti Incident</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The opportunity for greatness in the cinema in this period arose out of a simple, but central paradigm shift: the displacement of white hat vs. black hat with irony, ambiguity and self-examination.This had unique possibilities within westerns, because of the innate advantage of large settings, and larger than life, archetypal characters.Whereas Kurosawa did this with Japanese craft, Leone's m.o. is Italian expressionist excess. So Van Cleef has not just one weapon, but an arsenal...Volonte doesn't just escape prison, he kills the lawman who put him there AND his family, AND any temporary ally that suits him...Eastwood doesn't just off the bad guys, he carts away fourteen at once, limbs in all directions.There's a brilliant scene that has all three interested parties counting out the guards' steps around El Paso bank, combining mastery of the style, camera perspectives and ambiguity.Where it gets dicey is the attempt to leverage story ironies -- the questions of who trusts who, and for what reasons. Leone attempts to give El Indio an ironic edge with the conflation of memory, rape, guilt and honor triggered by the pocket watch chimes (expanding into a Fugue). But I don't think this is a real success -- Volonte is still a single-minded villain who just wants a 'larger share of dollars'. As it turns out, Eastwood and Van Cleef are essentially single-minded good guys too, the plot twist at the end notwithstanding.What would have propped this up more effectively is some framing device; say for example, a character within who discovers and documents the narrative -- the kind of device hinted at in "Unforgiven".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An excellent movie, although I was slightly disappointed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the last movie I had seen in the Man With No Name trilogy. This one, too, features Clint Eastwood as the Man With No Name. This one too, has stunning cinematography and an excellent atmosphere. What this movie doesn't have, is a captivating villain and a spectacular climax.The other movies in the series featured awesome villains - Ramon in "A Fistfull of Dollars" was quite plain as a character, but he had something unique about him, he used a Winchester rifle against the Man With No Name's Colt Peacemaker pistol. "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly", the best movie of the trilogy without a doubt, had Angel Eyes. Where else can you find a villain so cool and heartless as this bastard? Now what do we have in this movie? We have Lee Van Cleef (who played Angel Eyes) but not as a villain. He's an anti-hero (no character in the trilogy really fits the description of hero), and a cool one, but the villain is El Indio. And Indio was plain, boring and uninspiring. He was just a big angry Mexican, and there was nothing special about him.The other thing this movie lacked is a gripping climax. The other two films had amazing climaxes, and in both the climax was the highlight of the movie - it just kept getting better and better until it reached that climax. The duel against Ramon was special because the Man With No Name found a smart way to deal with his enemy's superior battle, and then it still turned out a quick-draw duel - only one of the men had a rifle! In "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly" we had the most amazing climax ever - a Mexican Standoff between three outstanding characters. And it was filmed in such an astonishing way that no movie climax has ever surpassed it. Here however, the climax is simply a duel. Man against man, pistol against pistol. It doesn't have the uniqueness of the climax in "A Fistful of Dollars" nor the brilliance of "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly". It is a good climax, obviously, but not on the same level as the other movies in the trilogy.Still though, I rated this movie a 9/10. And appropriately, because the movie has many highlights. The scenery is stunning, the cinematography is beautiful, the atmosphere is engrossing, and the acting is superb. And some scenes are near perfection, such as the opening sequences that introduce us to the two bounty hunters, Manco (The Man With No Name) and Colonel Mortimer, or the bank robbery scene. And therefore, this movie warrants a watch. While not quite so genius as "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly", it's an overall better movie than "A Fistful of Dollars", although with an ending not quite so powerful.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In this 1965, mostly Italian produced, movie filmed in Spain, and dubbed in English, two show-offish bounty hunters in the American Southwest set their sights on a ruthless "bandolero". I consider this film to be a spoof of traditional villains from 1940's and 50's westerns.The dudes in this film are tough hombres. They smoke. They spit. They sneer. They sling their guns. They strut their macho stuff. But mostly, they just stare at each other and look mean.The story is melodramatic and the characters swagger to the max. But the scenery here is absolutely majestic. The expansive and lonesome badlands are beautiful in their stark desolation. And in some scenes the bleak desert images combine with one of the most hauntingly poetic musical scores in film history, to create an expression of true cinematic art."For A Few Dollars More" is one of those films that appeals to me more for the music and the cinematography than for the story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another gritty Leone western is a buddy flick for Eastwood and Van Cleef...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is another iconic spaghetti western so popular in the mid-'60s due to Sergio Leone's direction of CLINT EASTWOOD and LEE VAN CLEEF, two mesmerizing actors in another western scored by the talented Ennio Morricone.This time the two men are bounty hunters, presumably hunting guilty men for the same reason--except that one of them has a special mission. Without giving any plot points away, let's just say that the pocket watch bit is a clever ploy in leading to one of the more important gunfights.All the usual ingredients to make this an Eastwood hit are present, but this time it's LEE VAN CLEEF who makes the strongest impression in a role that is laced with some biting humor and sarcasm, tough but clever and clearly the more interesting of the two. Nevertheless, Eastwood is in fine form and the two men make the best buddy team since "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid".The Morricone score will stick in your mind--and so will the overall impression the film makes as a tough spaghetti western.</fullReview>

The plot is not very complicated and you can argue some decisions made by the villain, but even with that, I think is very intelligent and probably by that you can't guess what is next. Eastwood, Cliff and 'El Indio' are good in their roles and the direction of Leone is superb. No doubt, Leone can be considered the best western director of all time, not by one movie but for his complete work.Please, watch this movie and rank it.

		<shortDescription>Cartoon-like epic western with something for everyone</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In this sequel, a tale of two bounty hunters who reluctantly join forces to try and bring down the most vicious criminal on the frontier, the production values far outstrip those of "A Fistful of Dollars", yet the story doesn't rise to the level of the original.But "For a Few Dollars More" -- which would become the second part of a Sergio Leone's so-called "Man With No Name" trilogy -- is not to be missed by anyone with even a passing interest in offbeat Westerns.The obvious difference in the quality of the script is surely due to the fact that Leone was working without Kurosawa's mastery as a guide. ("Fistful," along with several other films in recent memory, is derived from the Japanese director's 'lone samurai' tale, "Yojimbo.")But if Leone cannot compete with Kurosawa's storytelling genius (who himself had help from Ryuzo Kikushima and Dashiel Hammett) he was carving out his own unique niche in cinematic history.Here, the basic, irresistible elements of the "Spaghetti Western" -- Ennio Morricone's spare, knowing and highly dramatic score, Clint Eastwood's inscrutable half-eyed glare, the nearly comic circus-show gunplay -- familiar as a worn-in pair of boots to the great majority of American Sunday afternoon TV viewers, are solidified and put on full display.And they are unquestionably entertaining.By now parodied, emulated, and simply ripped off for decades, Leone, at the time, had managed to breathe new life (and death) into a genre that was fading at the hands of cinematic oversaturation -- just how many times could the same tale be told? -- and the advent of half-hour Western "teleplays".Eastwood's performance is essentially perfect, his presence as distinct as the noon sun over the desert sky, and Lee Van Cleef is a worthy foil. Gian Maria Volonté, the Italian actor who appears as the main (but different) villain in "Fistful," is a greasy, psychotic sadist who the scenery chewing maniacs in modern films seem to owe a debt to. The rest of the characters are drawn with similar wide strokes. (While Eastwood's "heroes" are often called amoral -- an assertion that doesn't really hold up under close scrutiny -- the supporting players are either pointing a gun at you, or with you. Look for Klaus Kinski as the "hunchback.")The dialogue, although it appears to have been filmed in English, is poorly re-dubbed, but nonetheless witty and terse, punctuated by some stunning heat-baked photography. (If after you learn that these films were not shot in the States it becomes impossible for you to see anything but the parched sands of Spain, surely you will agree that the territory lends a powerfully sinister feel to the film. Leone's greatest strength may have been that he seemed to set his Westerns on a slightly different planet than our own.)The film's main flaw -- and I can already hear the noir enthusiasts moaning -- is that there are a few too many twists and turns down the dusty trails, and slightly weary viewers may lose the satisfaction when the inevitable "moment of reckoning" arrives at the end of the film.Overall, this is a very good film -- fans of more modern films might liken the differences between "Fistful" and "A Few Dollars More" to those between Robert Rodriguez's low-budget debut "El Mariachi," and his Hollywood remake, "Desperado." Both are worthy films, but the grit of the original is more satisfying.It is important to note that Leone hit both marks -- realism and big-budget spectacle -- with the incredible "Once Upon A Time In The West."</fullReview>

The music in certain sequences sticks in your mind, such as "La Resa Di Conti" where Indio confronts Tomaso in the old church (it's unusual the use of an organ in music for a western). The music where Colonel Douglas Mortimer strikes a match off the Hunchback's braces is very similar to the music Morricone wrote for "The Untouchables" apart from the twangs on the Jew's harp. It is used for a few other scenes with the Hunchback such as outside the El Paso bank and the confrontation with Colonel Mortimer in the taberna in Agua Caliente. The music is faintly reminiscent of Mussorgsky's "The Gnome" from "Pictures at an Exhibition". Apart from the music another reason I like the film is the scenery. Some of the mountains in a few scenes are reminiscent of Scotland. There are a few Scottish mountains bear a likeness to the Spanish mountains seen behind Manco. An absolutely unique western, better than many American ones.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>THE ARCHETYPAL SPAGHETTI WESTERN</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before giving a comment, let me introduce the film to the readers: in 1964, Italian Director Sergio Leone made `A Fistful Of Dollars' starring Clint Eastwood and (the gorgeous!) Gian Maria Volonté. A year later, Leone made `For A Few Dollars More', and, in 1966, his masterpiece `The Good, The Bad and the Ugly'. The 3 films are known as `the so-called Dollars trilogy'.I watched the films in the wrong order, but I must say that FAFDM is an archetypal `Spaghetti Western', a genre characterized by a deceivingly simple plot, few but ironic lines, absurd coincidences, and intense violence. In FAFDM, Gian Maria Volonté and Lee Van Cleef gave a stunning performance, the former as a psychotic criminal, the latter as a cynical bounty killer. And, in the middle, the laconic man with no name (Clint Eastwood), another bounty killer, pairs up with either of the other two, depending on his interest.The soundtrack of that film, provided by the creative Ennio Morricone, was cleverly used to match the scenes. Watch out for the scene from the past where Volonté rapes Van Cleef's sister, and for the crosscutting between Van-Cleef's eyes and Volonté's face in his ?wanted' portrait. And Eastwood counts Volonté's men in terms of how much money their heads are worth!That film is rather long, but highly creative and entertaining. I've watched it 3 times and will watch it a 100 times again.If you're looking for THE Spaghetti Western, `For A Few Dollars More' would be it. And, trust me, you should own all three films, like I do, and their breathtaking soundtracks?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More dollars, less fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm a sucker for Westerns, apparently. Who wouldn't be? Few such works of uninhibited masculinity exist, and fewer still are entertaining enough to maintain my interest for more than an hour at a time, much less three. Fewer still pulsate with the raw energy and power embodied in those empty spaces, those quiet staring contests between men capable of blowing each other to bits with a twitch of their dusty digits, those treacherous wastelands, those hostile encounters, and those crusty, bearded, cigarette-chewing men imbued with only a desire to survive and succeed, no matter the cost. And in the case of this film, fewer still can boast being the established icons of the genre, the first films that come associated with the word "Western".Then why is For a Few Dollars More as middling as it is? In my humble opinion, For a Few Dollars More pales in comparison to its predecessor, the wonderfully entertaining Fistful of Dollars. The reasons for this are not few in number, but rather small in breadth. Basic, technical slip-ups resulting in an experience that feels curiously thinner and less satisfying. Sure, For a Few Dollars More has its moments, but when taken as a whole, it's a forgettable film that lacks the intelligence, energy, and sheer grit of the first and third films in Sergio Leone's legendary Dollars trilogy.As with its predecessor (but unlike its sequel), For a Few Dollars More concerns itself with moments rather than a calculated execution of a narrative. This in itself is excusable; it leads to a sort of haphazard adventure tinged with potent thrill. A scant narrative is undoubtedly better than one burdened by inscrutable complexity. But For a Few Dollars More simply can't deliver on those moments comprising its sustenance. Most of them, excluding a fantastic scene involving hats -- which I consider the second best scene in the whole trilogy -- are honestly quite boring. Leone draws them out to unnecessary length, which, while delivering on his old West portraits of masculinity, seem to stretch on indefinitely without sufficient reason or motivation. This effect is worsened by the fact that Leone gives us little to care about. In the first film, one could easily appreciate Eastwood's raw intelligence; after some time, it would be easy to care about him, at least to the point that you hope that he survives the predicament in which he finds himself.In a Few Dollars More, Eastwood's character is sidelined to allow Lee Van Cleef, who plays another superhuman bounty killer, to take center stage. And Van Cleef's cockiness destroys any notion of sympathy we might have had for him, while Eastwood, without sufficient space to exercise his intelligence, becomes a violent rodent far removed from the Bugs Bunny-ish wit of his original character. The villain is interesting as well, but Leone spends too much time making him seem troubled which serves little purpose. I don't like it when writers see fit to direct our sympathy towards unsympathetic characters. If Leone wanted to insert some effective character development, he should have given the villain's henchmen more screen time. By the time the film reached its disjointed and confusing climactic battle, I was still trying to figure out who everyone even was.The rest of the film is a whole lot of sitting and waiting. The innovation runs dry by the second half and the thrills die quickly off the mark. The action scenes feel limp and overdone while the staredowns become predictable. The ending is nowhere near as satisfying as the ending of Fistful of Dollars. And as with the other two, the dubbing is disgusting.I'm a sucker for Westerns, yes, but that doesn't mean that I'm completely blind to mediocrity. Of course, as I gave this film a generous 6, I can't say for certain that I'm seeing clearly.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Man with No Name?"Monco"/"Manco"? and Colonel Douglas Mortimer?the "Man in Black"?are two bounty killers in pursuit of "El Indio," one of the most wanted fugitives in the Wild West, and his gang. El Indio is ruthless, clever, and brutal. He has a musical pocket watch that he plays before engaging in gun duels: "When the chimes finish, begin," he says. Flashbacks reveal that El Indio took the watch from a young woman whom El Indio found with her lover (in Joe Millard's novelization of the film, her newly wed husband), killed him, and raped her; she killed herself while being raped. There is a photograph of the woman inside the cover of the watch; it was a gift from her lover (in the novelization, it was a wedding gift from her brother).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Top notch spaghetti western is one of the stand outs of its type</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sergio Leone's follow-up to his breakthrough A FISTFUL OF DOLLARS retains much of the exaggerated style of that film, except that this one is even better. This is mainly because a higher budget is evident, especially in the better cast. Once again, Ennio Morricone creates an appropriate and, it has to be said, brilliantly evocative score which is a highlight of the whole film. Although the running time comes in at two hours, this time flies by and is packed with plot twists and turns.The scorching desert locations are once again realistic and scene-setting; I especially liked the use of a white-walled ghost town which appears towards the film's end. Clint Eastwood reprises his role of The Man With No Name to great effect, although even here his thunder is stolen by Lee Van Cleef, who stars as a rival bounty hunter. Van Cleef is superb in this film, a real icon, and this is the film that made him famous. He has his lines and mannerisms directly right and the character seems to have been written for him, he fits it so well. The two men are supported by a criminal gang of really seedy-looking bad guys, headed by the excellent Gian Maria Volonte as Indio, the ruthless yet honourable murderer and robber who proves a worthwhile opponent for Eastwood and Van Cleef to take on. Klaus Kinski is also good in a small role as a hunchback whom Van Cleef uses to light a match - an act that Kinski isn't too pleased about.Opening with two well-staged scenes highlighting the shooting abilities of Eastwood and Van Cleef as they both track down wanted criminals, this film is well-photographed and edited throughout, with a sufficiently complex plot to carry it through. The ending is brilliant, and a classic one, with Morricone's powerful score suddenly sweeping over the final shoot-out. Things end on a high note with a great joke as well. Although Leone, Eastwood and Van Cleef would re-team again in 1966's THE GOOD, THE BAD AND THE UGLY, their three distinctive styles are immortalised in this classic film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>For a Few Dollars More?. we'll kick in a free poncho</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sergio Leone's For a Few Dollars More (1965, ***1/2) is, in theory, a sequel to A Fistful of Dollars, which was itself a big hit for the man and the studio. The bad news is that it's a sequel mostly in name, but the good (great) news is that it's every bit as deliciously violent and captivating as its predecessor.Clint Eastwood returns, although he's no longer The Man with No Name; he's Monco, a "bounty killer" ? not a bounty hunter, because that might imply he intends to bring 'em back alive. Monco has his eyes on a desperado named Indio, played by Italian actor Gian Maria Volont?. Trouble is, another bounty killer, name of Colonel Mortimer (Lee van Cleef) also wants Indio. The fact that the man has a reward of $10,000 on his head probably figures into things a little. Add in the rest of the gang, and you're looking at maybe $27,000. Which today I assume would be $75 million. I don't know, you look it up.Mortimer and Monco do decide to team up; after all, we can't have too many bad guys. That doesn't mean that they won't try to double cross one another. The plan is for Monco to infiltrate Indio's band and get him to move north, toward the town of El Paso, where they'll attempt to rob the town's Fort-Knox-like bank. Oh, Indio goes north all right, with Monco, and the bank is hit, but?well, let's just say things don't go as planned for anyone.For a Few Dollars More is an epic, even though it's "only" 132 minutes long. I mean it's an epic in the same way that Lawrence of Arabia is an epic, with majestic, sweeping vistas followed by (in Leone's case) extreme closeups of the three leads. There are duels in the streets, just as you'd expect a western to have. For all I know, this happened all the time, and in this movie it happens repeatedly. Still, it's not as if every fight is carefully sanctioned, as there are plenty of ambushes to be found.This was the middle film in the series that really put the then-somewhat-young Eastwood on the map. Van Cleef's Mortimer calls him "kid," and Eastwood's calls Mortimer "old man"; in reality, the two were only five years apart in age. Eastwood, of course, is still kicking; he turned 86 a couple of months ago. Maybe his days as a taciturn gunslinger are long behind him, but he's still a creative genius. And he learned a lot of the directorial tricks of the trade from Leone himself, a master of the western genre. This, along with its series counterparts, is definitely not to be missed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is no different than any of Eastwood's western: it's silly, it's cliché, uninspired, macho, stereotyped, hardly tackles any historical events that occurred, testosterone, and same grin facial expression throughout the entire movie.The dialogue is a mess, it's pretty much two guys thinking highly of themselves because they get to shoot guns for 15 min non-stop. Gosh, even the Blueberry the comic book in thirty volumes managed to come up with better story lines. One again, Eastwood looks li,e he has sand in his mouth and and teeth because it's the same exact facial expression that pretty much sums up his acting skills. This is a just a music of guys looking at each other, shooting guns, scratching their bulls, that's not the recipe for a good movie. And some of the quotes from the movie are incredibly cheesy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Its directed by Sergio Leone. No introduction needed man. Screenplay by Luciano Vincenzoni (The Good, the Bad and the Ugly, The Mercenary, Duck-You Sucker, Death Rides a Horse). Cinematography by Massimo Dallamano (Duello nel Texas, A Fistful of Dollars). Editing by Eugenio Alabiso (Body Count (1986), Eaten Alive! (1980), The Mountain of the Cannibal God (1978), The Good, the Bad and the Ugly). Music by the legendary Ennio Morricone. For a Few Dollars More is a much bolder film than A Fistful of Dollars, largely because of its brutal violence and gritty realism. Its mean, violent and immoral, just the way any good Spaghetti Western should be. This movie is the second in the so-called Dollars trilogy. This is the story of two different yet very similar men, Eastwood and Lee Van Cleef (High Noon, The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance, The Good, the Bad and the Ugly, Death Rides a Horse, Escape from New York) are two bounty hunters who are after the criminal Gian Maria Volonte (A Fistful of Dollars). German actor Klaus Kinski (Doctor Zhivago, The Great Silence, Count Dracula, Nosferatu the Vampyre, Nosferatu in Venice) also plays a supporting role as a secondary villain. Ennio Morricones score is also a classic. His music is always appropriate and often the best part of the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>For a Few Dollars More</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Colonel Mortimer and Manko are a pair of bounty killers; they work alone making a living hunting down criminals for the rewards; when mad-dog killer 'El Indio' is broken out of prison they end up working together to bring him and his gang to justice. El Indio has no intention of going into hiding; he and his gang plan to rob the bank in El Paso; the most secure bank in the west. In order to catch the gang Manko breaks one of Indio's men out of prison so that he can infiltrate the gang and bring it down from within while Mortimer plans to work from the outside.This, the second of the 'Dollar trilogy', is a classic spaghetti western that sees Clint Eastward and Gian Maria Volont? return playing similar character to those they played in 'A Fistful of Dollars'. They are joined by Lee van Cleef who plays Colonel Mortimer. The film gets off to a fine start; introducing each of the three main characters in scenes that give us an insight into their characters. Once they have been introduced the story moves at a good pace with plenty of action as well as some genuinely funny moments? most notably when Mortimer strikes a match on the face of one of Indio's men. As one might expect Eastwood does a fine job as Manko, Lee van Cleef is solid as the older character, Col Mortimer and Volont? is suitably unpleasant as the crazed Indio. While there is lots of action there is very little blood and little to cause offence. Sergio Leone's direction features his trademark extreme close-ups and widescreen vistas that work so well in tense shoot-outs and to give us a feeling of the vastness of the west respectively. The score Ennio Morricone perfectly fits with the film especially where the chimes of Indio's watch gradually swell to include organ music as the characters wait to draw their pistols. Overall I'd definitely recommend this to any fans of the genre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A solid sequel in a trilogy that I would suggest watching</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Man With no Name Trilogy is considered to be the single best collection of Western movies. I haven't seen that many but in tone it seems to blend in what works and what maybe seen by today's audiences as slightly over-the-top without losing said tone. That and you can watch them in any order and still have an idea what's going on while also telling pretty good stories. This is no exception.The Man With No Name and another badass bounty hunter on the same level of skill as The Man With No Name both find out about each other through them both seeing a leader of a gang escape with a reward of $10,000. Rather then the town not being big enough for the both of them or something like that they find out that they could use each-others skills to take him and his gang of 14 down together. Knowing no matter how fast The Man With No Name can shoot or how far away the other one can shoot the target they know they can't take on all 14 head-on so they decide to take out the gang from within by having The Man With No Name join and the other one observes. This is where things get complicated.Eastwood shines in this movie as does Lee Van Cleef. The Cinematography is also pretty good and I like the soundtrack. If there is any complaint it's that there are moments like in all westerns where 2 stare each other down. This movie does it a few times and each it's done a little too cheesy.So to round off what I think of the trilogy. I'd suggest if you do see it to not watch Yojimbo first. I don't know, when I watched A Fistful Of Dollars I thought it was done much better all-round with Yojimbo despite both being really good. Either way, my opinion of all three remains the same. They're really good westerns and I recommend them, the best one in the series being The Good, The Bad and The Ugly for going the extra mile and making a statement about The Civil War.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For a Few Dollars More is the second spaghetti-western directed by Sergio Leone and the middle title of the "Dollars trilogy". It's also his second partnership with Clint Eastwood and with Ennio Morricone, one of the most brilliant and prolific soundtrack composers of all time.The basic plot is quite simple, but Leone takes a while to reveal it: during the first 30 minutes we are presented to Colonel Douglas Mortimer (Lee van Cleef), a quiet and clever bounty hunter specialist in long range shooting, Manco (Eastwood), also a bounty hunter who's very quick on the trigger and with an obscure moral code, and Indio (Volonté), a twisted and ruthless bandit with a genuine relish to kill. These 3 men stories will naturally cross when Indio, helped by his gang, escapes from prison killing most of the guards what immediately puts a prize on his head, a prize that both bounty hunters want for themselves. Manco and Mortimer eventually meet and, after a tense strength comparison, form a partnership to hunt the villain and his gang, who are in the meantime planning to rob the Bank of El Paso, said to contain a million dollars in a disguised safe. On the center of this story are also two identical musical pocket watches, one used by Mortimer and the other one by Indio. Soon we understand that there is more than money at stake between these 2 men as the pocket watches seem to exert some kind of obsession upon their carriers.For a Few Dollars More has all the advantages of not being the first major spaghetti western, being more mature than its predecessor, For a Fistful of Dollars (1964). Everyone knows now exactly how to do things: Leone has solidified his style and technique, Eastwood and Volonté are much more comfortable with their characters (Eastwood, in particular, delivers his best performance on a Leone film) and the new guy, Lee van Cleef is an amazing addition to the cast, lending his coolness and experience to this masterpiece. Also in the acting field, it's a pleasure to watch Klaus Kinski and Luigi Pistilli as member of the gang. Small roles but huge actors!I've already talked about Leone being more mature. In fact, it's his direction that makes of this film such a great one. From beginning to end, the tension is built at a slow yet steady pace, fitting perfectly its 2 hour length. It's not made to be an "opera" like Once Upon a Time on the West (1968) or even The Good, The Bad and The Ugly (1965) and it's its almost lack of grandiosity that makes this such a brilliant western. It's hard, gritty and straight to the point and the Italian director is clever enough to make of every aspect of the film perfectly tuned with his concept: the calm but relentless music of Morricone's outstanding soundtrack, the quiet personality of the 3 lead characters, the great pacing management and the glorious cinematography and camera work create the ideal conditions to an apotheotic final duel, where the tension is stretched to an almost nauseating point, and solved with a fast and powerful explosion. And that is Leone's secret: creating impact by contrast.Speaking of the final duel, the key scene of the film, again the musical pocket watches play a very important part. Indio always used the chimes from the watch to begin his duels: "When you hear the music finish, begin." The obsession he had with that watch and the uncertainty created on his opponent of when the music would actually stop, always gave him advantage. However, Mortimer knew well the tune and had even stronger reasons to be attracted by that watch. For the first time, Indio had no initial advantage. On the other hand, Mortimer is using Manco's gun, lighter and smaller than his own, hence faster to draw. The result is not hard to predict and yet the suspense created is breathtaking. When it's all over and the two bounty hunters go separate ways it's hard not to feel a void inside, as we see Mortimer riding to the sunset perhaps not to be seen again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is an sequel to A Fistful of Dollars, returning Clint Eastwood as The Man With No Name, who forms a partnership with bounty hunter Col. Douglas Mortimer (Lee Van Cleef) to track down a nefarious gang of outlaws, led by the cold-blooded El Indio (Gian Maria Volonté).Eastwood gave another solid performance as the gun-totting cowboy, providing much action, wit and incognito elements in a film full of drama and action. Like the previous film, I believe Director Sergio Leone gave us a very adventurous film with unpredictable moments that captures your interest. It is fun to watch Eastwood and Van Cleef's methods of operation as they try to bring down the notorious gang; the ambiguous personal backgrounds of Eastwood and Van Cleef's characters add onto the suspense of the story.However, I just the pacing of the story was a little slow at times, as they were a lot of all talk and less action in the packed, two-hour movie. And, Indio was just too trigger-happy - one bad$$ dude you would just love to punch around.Ennio Morricone gave us another catchy music score, perfect for a western movie and matching one of Eastwood's most iconic movie roles well.Overall, it's a good, entertaining western sequel to watch.Grade B</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This follow-up to "A Fistful of Dollars" is even more stylish, humorous, and bloody than its predecessor. The dialogue is clunky, not because of the poor English dubbing that is common throughout Sergio Leone's spaghetti westerns, but because Clint Eastwood's stogie-chomping protagonist loses some of his mystique when he is made to chat at length with townsfolk and a fellow bounty hunter. But colorful characters and creative set-pieces more than make up for this misstep. Lee Van Cleef proved an effective counterpart to Eastwood and would reappear, in a different role, in "The Good, The Bad, and the Ugly," the grandest and last film in Leone's "Man With No Name" trilogy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Two rival bounty hunters, "Monco" (Clint Eastwood) and "Colonel Douglas Mortimer" (Lee Van Cleef) find themselves after the same bandit who goes by the name of "El Indio" (Gian Maria Volante). Realizing that El Indio has surrounded himself with so many other bandits, both of them enter into an uneasy alliance with each other. In the meantime, El Indio and his men have decided to rob the Bank of El Paso which raises the stakes for everyone. At any rate, this film is the second of the "spaghetti westerns" which followed the highly successful "A Fistful of Dollars". And although it isn't a sequel, it has several actors who starred in both films, most notably Clint Eastwood, Gian Maria Volante and Mario Brega (as the bandit, "Nino"). And like the first movie, these three performed similar roles in a superb manner. But what really distinguishes this film from the previous one is the presence of Lee Van Cleef who, in my opinion, was just as good as Clint Eastwood. In any case, this film is just as good as its predecessor and those who enjoy this style of western are sure to appreciate this one as well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From its playful opening credits sequence to its modernistic end, For A Few Dollars More is entertaining and well made, in almost all aspects, and its subversion of Western conventions is so complete that one might call it a Western in name only; it's more of a buddy or caper film. It is also a film specifically aimed at creating myth, both within its diegetic world, and in its non-diegetic world., and it is far above even the best of the pre-Leone Western films, like John Ford's Stagecoach, or Howard Hawks' Red River and Rio Bravo. And, while it does not reach the unassailable heights of the truly great films that Leone would later make, one can see, in the film, and in its structure, the DNA of greatness that Leone gave this film, and which had been born in him. And with that gift, the man also showed the way to greatness for other practitioners of the genre, and film in general. That it would take a while longer to come to his own full fruition is merely how life mostly is. And when the wait is rewarded as well as Leone rewarded his audience, one always looks back on it with fondness. Thus, here is where the countdown truly began. Do the honors yourself?.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I will start this review by a simple comparison. I really feel that "A Fistful of Dollars", the first opus of Sergio Leone's Dollars Dollars trilogy owes to "Yojinbo" just as much as Francis Ford Coppola's "The Godfather" owes to Mario Puzo's novel. The creations that inspired the directors were significant, but not necessarily superior. I enjoy "A Fistful of Dollars" more than "Yojinbo" because Akira Kurosawa's film already had a Western feel that made the story stylishly awkward and let's face it, "The Godfather" as a novel, is not for literature what the film is for Cinema.Now, let me go further with my game of correspondences, "For a Few Dollars More", in my opinion, is for "A Fistful of Dollars" what "The Godfather Part II" is for "The Godfather", not by its status as a sequel or second installment but in the way it demonstrates Sergio Leone's capability to make an original film out of a material that didn't belong to him at first. Like Coppola who wrote an original plot involving characters he didn't create, Leone was able to take the same material of the first movie to make a truly original film and a beautiful continuation of the Man-With-No-Name's adventure. Call it inspiration or adaptation, the film is the proof that "A Fistful of Dollars"' greatness didn't only rely on the fact that it was the remake of a foreign ingenuous script; it's the work of a talented director, that stands alone as a classic. And the confirmation came one year later with "A Few Dollars More", a major Western film that elevates Leone's status as a unique filmmaker and probably the most stylish and entertaining director of Westerns.The film opens with the opening statement : "Where life had no value, death, sometimes, had its price. That is why the bounty killers appeared" The film opens with the shooting of a man on his horse while the opening credits are conducted by Ennio Morricone's haunting score, maybe not the best, but this is not saying much when compared to "A Fistful of Dollars", "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly" or "Once Upon a Time in the West". The film is about two bounty hunters, Lee Van Cleef as Colonel Douglas Mortimer and Clint Eastwood as Manco, "the one-armed man" is a nickname due to his facility to use only one arm for shooting. Both are fast guns and professional bounty hunters, not the safest job but certainly the most profitable for as long as there would be criminals, there would be bounty hunters. Bounty hunters are as valuable for the Old West's society as buzzards and coyotes for the ecosystem. Like "A Fistful of Dollars" (and "Yojinbo"), the protagonists are not the most moral characters in the world.Only, this time, the distinction between heroes and villains is clearer since the targets of the bounty hunters are criminals wanted dead or alive, which puts reasonable limitations on our level of empathy toward them. But again, the question is not to discuss the morality of this or that character, "For a Few Dollars More" invites us to follow a group of men, whose fates meet in a tale of revenge, vengeance, greed and strategy, surrounding three distinct figures. And beyond the coolness of Manco, the authority of Colonel Mortimer and the vileness of El Indio, the most hunted fugitive in the West, played by Gian Maria Volonte, they all share a common quality: they're domineering, intelligent and with a remarkable capacity to anticipate the moves of the adversaries. The plot evolves with a chess game precision. that reminded me of Kurosawa's "Sanjuro" And the chess game metaphor is even more eloquent when Manco and Colonel decides to team up and El Indio sacrifices some men to get away from them.And all through the film, it's impossible to determine who's the cleverest of the trio, each one has a moment to shine, and the film does a great job, developing the schemes of the three characters, from the bank robberies, to the way to get the safe from the bank of El Paso, and then to keep the loot, and share it with the team ... the film clearly points out that it's easy to steal money and difficult to keep it, it goes to subtle details where everything, every single action is guided by a desire to have 'a few dollars more', El Indio can have more money if he gets rid of some men, Manco and Colonel can have more of Indio's men if they team up, which means more money, or less, it depends. Greed acts like a double-edged sword and is obviously the most redoubtable enemy of each character.But beyond these philosophical undertones, the film proves to have much more depth than many Westerns, featuring a great set of spectacular scenes, carried by wonderful performances from Gian Maria Volonte, Lee Van Cleef, and Clint Eastwood and a honorable mention for Kinski as Wild, the hunchback. All these faces are cruelly missing ? "For a Few Dollars More" is full of so many memorable moments, probably the most defining being the pocket watch with the penetrating carillon music and Indio's unforgettable "When the chimes end, pick up your gun" The film is full of Leone's archetypes that became trademarks of the Western Spaghetti, with long close-ups on ugly, sweaty and greasy faces, and this beautiful profile shot where a face beautifully completes the landscape. Again, Leone provides a masterpiece of over-direction that elevates the most ordinary story to epic proportions, until an operatic and mind-blowing showdown."A Fistful of Dollars" was Leone making his entrance among the great directors, and "For a Few Dollars More" cemented the legend, and still, the best was still to come ?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>All the swagger of Fistful, but improved script, and the man in black is awesome!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I enjoyed the swagger of A Fistful of Dollars, but had some reservations about the quality of its script. This second installment in the "Dollars Trilogy" thematic series had all the swagger of Fistful, including awesome music and sick camera work, but also improved in the quality of script. It seemed that this story was more thought out, including plot twists and better character development, whereas Fistful's story appeared to be put in place merely to set up cool tag lines and posturing between Eastwood and Volonté. There was pretty heavy action in this second film, too: the total kill count was 30.Eastwood continued to show the world why he would eventually be regarded as one of the baddest mofos to ever grace the silver screen. Volonté was crazier and more ruthless in this film than he was in the first, and I loved it! Last but not least, Van Cleef may have stolen the show as the man in black, veteran bounty hunter Col. Douglas Mortimer?it wasn't clear who the bigger badass was. In fact, Van Cleef claimed to be faster on the draw than Eastwood. He only took three frames of film (one eighth of a second) to draw, cock and fire! All in all, this film is a classic, and a great representative of what the spaghetti Western has to offer. About midway through, the pace dramatically slowed to an almost boring pace (although my perception may have been a bit clouded by beer-induced sleepiness), but it soon picked back up again, and the movie ended very strongly. I recommend that you set aside some time to watch this flick at some point, preferably with some alcohol and a friend that enjoys spaghetti Westerns, B movies, or campy films. I can't wait to see The Good, the Bad and the Ugly.For more reviews and a kickass podcast, check out www.livemancave.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"This time you will have a chance to shoot me, but not in the back."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A+ One of my favorite movies of all time, another Sergio Leone masterpiece. Clint Eastwood, called Manco (Portuguese for 'lame-handed'. Italian equivalent would be Monco) This time around, and once again the portrayal of the anti-hero is iconic. However, even he meets his match with Lee Van Cleef, playing Colonel Douglas Mortimer. I know fans probably debate this all the time, but it was clearly established in that first meet scene that Mortimer is the better shot. Not to undermine Eastwood, after all the two working together produce quite a body count in the usual bad-ass fashion. My favorite Leone villain would undoubtedly be Indio, played masterfully by Gian Maria Volonté. He's undeniably a killer, a conniving schemer, and yes even a madman perhaps but he's also distraught permanently by what he's done. Or rather one crime in particular, but I won't spoil it.It was my first Spaghetti Western as a matter of fact. I stumbled upon it on TV, right about the scene where Indio extracts revenge on the man who betrayed him. It's quite possibly my favorite scene in the whole movie. The numerous wide-angle shots, the glorious close-ups, and the thrill of Ennio Morricone's score, they all come together to create unrivaled tension. Of all things, an organ plays a tune that could belong to a horror film, but it fits so perfectly. As a boy of eight I was completely mesmerized by the scene.The cinematography is quite well done, always lingering on an object to add dimension or meaning. Note how when Eastwood's character stares at the wanted poster for Indio, his eyes linger on the money. When Mortimer looks at the same poster, the camera cuts back and forth between his eyes and that piece of paper, the sound of gunshots add to the scene awesomely. Cleverly, Leone is building up that there's more than money driving Cleef's character. And of course the sets are awesome, and for being filmed in Europe, one would never guess that it's anything but the American West itself. The film boasts incredible cinematography, a thrilling score and bad-ass characters. I reiterate that this is one of the best movies ever made, and I hold to it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is like being blind and suddenly getting your sight back. The quality of storytelling is so poor in most films that you almost become inured to it. Then you watch something like For A Few Dollars More and your eyes are reopened to the power and promise of cinema. Yeah, I know that sounds a little pretentious for a Spaghetti Western about bank robbery, bounty killers and familial revenge. When filmmakers can bring this level of skill and vision to an ubermacho cowboy drama, though, it shames all the supposedly more sophisticated work that flounders where this motion picture soars.Colonel Douglas Mortimer (Lee Van Cleef) is an aging gun man who uses his wits and cutting edge Wild West tech to claim the rewards on wanted men. Monco (Clint Eastwood) is a younger gunhand cocky enough to walk into any situation and fast enough on the draw to shoot his way out. These two men decide to team up to bring down the notorious bandit Indio (Gian Maria Volonte) and his gang as they execute a daring bank robbery. The tormented and utterly ruthless Indio proves to be much smarter than they expected, however, and the bounty killers are forced into a desperate battle where Colonel Mortimer reveals a much more personal vendetta at work.The key phrase in movies is "show, don't tell" and the three opening sequences that introduce Mortimer, Monco and Indio are about as sterling an example of that as you will ever see. With each man barely speaking, their actions tell the audience everything they are and starkly define the differences that separate them. Moritmer and Monco are introduced trying to collect the rewards on two violent men, but how they do that is definitively different. Moritmer is relentless will and dispassionate intelligence, while Monco is pure balls and lightning reflexes. Indio's introduction finds him taking revenge on a traitor in a way that shows him to be utterly without scruples but with an emotional depth that prevents him from being nothing but an automaton of evil. So many ambitious filmmakers worry so much about what they're going to do with the camera. Sergio Leone shows them here that it's what you do with your characters that matters most.Not that Leone doesn't know what to do with the camera. There are so many great shots and great scenes here that it's hard to decide which is the best. Is it the standoff in the street between Monco and Mortimer? The final climatic shootout? Monco's wagon of corpses? Indio's unforgettable vengeance? Monco's welcoming committee to Agua Caliente? Mortimer unveiling his arsenal as his prey tries to flee? There's such beautiful staging and rhythm to it all.And the music, good grief. The soundtrack isn't quite as all encompassing as Conan the Barbarian (the Arnold original, of course), but For A Few Dollars More is one of the rare movies that can match Conan's score for thrilling intensity and thematic punch. When Indio's revenge explodes into organ music and the final gunfight evolves from delicate chimes to a symphony of anticipation, only someone's whose been dead for three weeks won't feel their heart beat a little harder and their blood pump a little faster.The performances here are also about as fine as you get for this sort of thing. Clint Eastwood is effective but mostly unexceptional. He's played more interesting versions of this same character many times. Gian Maria Volonte is spectacular in all his sweaty, unstable glory. He marvelously projects this tortured, self-destructive drive in Indio to the point where it's never clear if he's defeated by the bounty killers or by himself. And Lee Van Cleef may be the manliest man to ever walk the Earth as Mortimer. His controlled, mature machismo is not just in contrast to the younger, brasher Monco. Mortimer is sort of the last stand of grown up masculinity before it got swallowed up in a flood of adolescent smartassery in cinema.For A Few Dollars More is an absolute must see, and not just among Westerns. The timeless art and craft here deserve to be ranked among the best films of all time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better (than "A Fistful of Dollars")</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"For a Few Dollars More" is Italian director Sergio Leone's 1965 entry into his landmark "Dollars trilogy" of European-made "spaghetti westerns" and are arguably better than their big-studio American counterparts. Leone's "spaghetti westerns" are most memorable for turning star Clint Eastwood into a western icon overseas, while he was a Hollywood reject here in the United States (he was also starring at the time in the popular American TV series "Rawhide")."For a Few Dollars More" is a better film than its 1964 predecessor "A Fistful of Dollars," largely because it has better acting, better direction, better pacing, better Ennio Morricone film score, and is also a much more brutal and violent film than "A Fistful of Dollars."And Eastwood was certainly gaining speed as a movie star with his second outing as the anti-hero "Man With No Name" who does in fact have a name here, "Manco." As the "Man With No Name," this time out Eastwood's a bounty hunter trying to capture the recently escaped convict Indio (Gian Maria Volonte) and his gang of hardened gunslingers.But unfortunately for him, the "Man With No Name" is not the only bounty hunter in town gunning for Indio and his boys. Another bounty hunter by the name of Colonel Douglas Mortimer (the late Lee Van Cleef) is also in town looking to collect the $10,000 bounty that's been put on Indio's head. The rival bounty hunters realize that because they're out-gunned 14-2 by Indio's gang, the only way to beat him is to team up and split the money right down the middle, which is something that is easier said than done."For a Few Dollars More" is a much bolder film than "A Fistful of Dollars," largely because of its brutal violence and gritty realism. Leone was certainly starting to gain his footing as a director of almost limitless vision and ambition, and the willingness to take risks and try new things with each successive entry into his "Dollars trilogy." He again operates his camera to show the dry, oppressive desert-scape of the Old West as a place of murderous violence and not much respect for human life. It's a dark and dangerous vision of the Old West that rightfully earns its title as the "Wild West"; it would be a long time before Hollywood would get the idea that the western genre was changing, and Sam Peckinpah's landmark bloodbath "The Wild Bunch" debuted in 1969 to challenge traditional movie standards of what can and can't be shown on the big screen."For a Few Dollars More" was followed by a third film, "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly" (1967), which brought Leone's landmark "Dollars trilogy" to an epic closer. Eastwood would also do a few more westerns himself over the years, but he would send it off brilliantly with his tragic anti-western "Unforgiven" in 1992.10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Few Dollars, Worth Watching</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The second film in Sergio Leone's mislabeled "Man With No Name" trilogy, takes the tone, music, violence, and hard-boiled character types from the first film and lets them rip, making for some really big entertainment.Henry Fonda's role in Leone's Once Upon A Time In The West is often referred to as "the coldest villain in screen history". As the bandit El Indio, Gian Maria Volante has him totally beaten! He and Lee Van Cleef also threaten to top Eastwood in the screen presence department, with the whole trio giving the title characters in The Good, The Bad, And The Ugly a good run for their money as well.The rousing score by Ennio Morricone (probably his best) is used wall-to-wall and cranked up to full effect, drenching the action in operatic sound and western atmosphere.An interesting fact, is that United Artist's lateness in purchasing For A Few Dollars More resulted in the studio owning the film, though not the music rights, which were (and still are) controlled by RCA Records. In order to fix the situation, United Artist Records' musical director Leroy Holmes orchestrated his own arrangements of Morricone's score and released an alternate soundtrack LP, with the official movie poster on the front, a photograph of Eastwood on the back, and liner notes promising many more sequels to come! Never released on CD, it's actually pretty lively and worth seeking out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Beautiful sequel that greatly continues the Spaghetti westerns, starring the man himself once again, Clint Eastwood, or in this movie, Monco. A year later from a Fistful, fresh off and ready for more, Eastwood continues his amazing performances of gunning down bandits and being awesome as ever!The man with no name returns in this film as Monco, who forms an alliance with a bounty hunter named Douglas Mortimer, (Lee Van Cleef) to kill a bounty, along with his entire gang, and split the $10,000 prize between the two.Clever story combined with great characters, including the villains, make this a worthy sequel. Though it can tend to drag on just a tiny bit, and doesn't have as strong action as the other one did, though it is replaced with solid key build up moments, along with entertaining conflicts and situations. Clint and Lee make a great team. When one is in trouble, the other arrives just in time to save them.The film in general is just a big great sequel. It could maybe stand out as a film on its own. It doesn't have too many references to the first, but it still continues the legend of the man with no name, and continues to show us the awesomeness that is Clint Eastwood! Followed by The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lee Von Cleef as the charismatic Col. Douglas Mortimer!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Another good western (? la spaghetti!) by none other than yours truly: Sergio Leone! For those of you that do not know what a spaghetti western is, let me explain.Spaghetti Western, also known as Italo-Western, is a nickname for a broad sub-genre of Western films that emerged in the mid-1960s in the wake of Sergio Leone's unique and much copied film-making style and international box-office success, so named by American critics because most were produced and directed by Italians. The correct term for these films, in Italy, is western all'italiana (Italian-Style Western); British critics tended to use the label Continental Western to describe these films, and the phrase 'Spaghetti Western' was originally created by American critics as a derogatory name for this group of films but has over time become accepted by fans of the films. The language in which the movies were originally released was Italian as well, but as most of the films featured multilingual casts and sound was invariably post-synched, most Westerns all'Italiana do not have an official dominant language.Over to the film. The best actor here is Lee Von Cleef. Cleef played the villain in another legendary western directed by Leone: The Good, The Bad and The Ugly (1966). Here he's the good guy.Shoulder to shoulder to him is Gian Maria Volonté. And if you think about it he always is the iconic villain in Leone's films. The next in line is Clint Eastwood who supports Cleef well. Clint is a household name worldwide so I need not elaborate on him.Plot: Colonel Mortimer (Cleef) illegally stops a train in Tucumcari, and soon after collects a bounty of $1,000 on Guy Calloway (José Terrón). Mortimer's gunslinging skill is displayed as he easily kills him from long distance. After collecting the bounty he inquires about Red "Baby" Cavanagh (José Marco), who has a $2,000 bounty, and was last seen in White Rocks. Mortimer is told that Cavanagh has already been targeted by Eastwood's character, who is referred to as "Manco".We see Manco ride into town and track down Cavanagh at a saloon playing five-card draw poker. Manco kills him and his men, and takes the bounty. Eventually, the two bounty hunters, after learning about each other from different sources, meet in El Paso and, after butting heads, decide to team up to take down El Indio, one of the most wanted fugitives in the western territories, and his gang.Meanwhile, Indio's men free him from prison where he was held. After hies release, Indio's primary goal is to rob the Bank of El Paso and its disguised safe containing "almost a million dollars." Mortimer persuades a reluctant Manco to join Indio's gang during the robbery in order to "get him between two fires." Manco is offered membership in the gang after rescuing one of Indio's friends from prison.What are Mortimer's reasons for pursuing Indio? Will he and Manco overcome Indio and his gang? Watch and find out! Verdict: Buy it on VCD/DVD/BLURAY! You may also like these: A Fistful of Dollars, The Good, the Bad and the Ugly, Once Upon a Time in the West and Duck, You Sucker!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The iconic western gunslinger is back and better than ever. Now this is a western that is very much worth the time to watch, in fact it's probably one of the most favorite western flick to most movie buffs that actually like western movies. This isn't a dry western either and it's a western that most audiences can enjoy, in fact I sort of found this sequel to be bit more entertaining, although it isn't really a sequel. It didn't have that classic feel to "A Fistful of Dollars" but it felt a bit more entertaining never the less. It's the least notorious when it comes to this trilogy but it still has it's rightful place in this trilogy. It's good to see a groundbreaking actor such as Clint Eastwood being in another great western movie such as this. The lone gunman is now a bounty hunter but the bounty isn't the only problem although the villain does stand out. But he also has to deal with a rival bounty hunter that is on the trail for the same bounty. And I must say Lee Van Cleef makes a pretty good rival. Anyways there is more to this story as it progresses just when you feel like you got down the main plot of this movie. This is a spaghetti western with some good storytelling and a entertaining one that will inspire other future movies to come. It's a old western that even the modern audiences can still enjoy and have a good time with, especially when it comes to audiences that enjoy western movies. Even most of the characters are interesting or adds something to this film. This movie is what true western is all about and yet it isn't dry but also entertaining. The gunfights are also one of the most awesome western gunfights in a film.8.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sergio Lenoe's 'Man With No Man' trilogy is probably the only film series in history that only got better from one to the next; 'For a Few Dollars More' is better than 'A Fistful of Dollars', but not as great as the classic third installment. That's enough to make it a major classic, and it's indeed one of the best westerns ever made; Eastwood is at his very best, and Lee Van Cleef is fantastic as well.Artistically, it's a transitional piece; the music and cinematography took a huge bound forward from the first movie. And while it still doesn't make for scenes as timeless and unforgettable as the ones in the third installment, it's still one of the most grittily beautiful films of its time.

		<fullReview>The second movie in Sergio Leone's "spaghetti trilogy" comes vividly to life in blu-ray. The white buildings framed against the bluest of skies, the meandering, wide-angle countryside, are in much sharper focus, as of course are the main characters, Clint Eastwood and the newly introduced Lee Van Cleef ? not to mention that baddest of baddies, Gian Maria Volonte ("El Indio").Way ahead of its time in terms of the use of facial close-ups to build up the tension, this is probably the most climactic of the trilogy, ending as it does in a three way stand-off which utilises that haunting chime melody heard throughout the film, as its starting gun.Startlingly original, and hardly dated at all, FaFDM holds the viewer (or maybe just lovers of the genre?) like few other films can, even forty five years after it was made. Yet it also combines some humorous touches ? light moments amongst the mayhem and growing body count.The interaction between Clint and Lee Van Cleef works well and at one point the brooding Van Cleef appears to be even cooler than Clint, as he strikes a match on the fuming hunchback.Love 'em or hate 'em the fistful trilogy set the bar for future westerns, and set it high. Few have equalled, and even fewer surpassed, these iconic movies, and they remain as a lasting tribute to the father of the genre ? Sergio Leone.But do yourself a favour - to truly appreciate this master at work spend a few dollars more ? and watch this on blu-ray.You will not be disappointed, and if you are ? well??that's tough amigo!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Trump Card of the Spaghetti Westerns</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The most complete and spectacular of Leone's westerns, this really boils down to the once in a lifetime performances of Clint Eastwood and Lee Van Cleef. As world-class bounty hunters chasing the same contract, the two agree to an uneasy truce before turning every trick in the book to double-cross and one-up each other. It's an unrelenting barrage of stern-faced masculinity, bravado and marksmanship, with filthy hired hands perfectly willing to trade bullets around every other corner. As with each of the director's dust-soaked pictures, this film covers for its small budget with an excess of personality and buckets of atmosphere, which results in a tougher, bolder, more genuine take than the most expensive Hollywood blockbusters of today. The infamous showdown with a truly despicable set of bounties may be what sends this picture riding off into the sunset, but it's a quieter scene earlier in the story that's always stuck with me: two grizzled old hunters trying to impress one other with nothing more than an empty street, a set of pistols and a pair of bullet-riddled hats.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While fistful of dollars was a fantastic western, it failed to give a voracious punch. The ambiguity of Clint's character was what makes him the man he is. Film with a low budget, the impression that Fistful of dollars sends out is that it more of a platform for Sergio Leone to showcase his talent. While containing fantastic set pieces, Fistful of dollars wasn't truly captivating.This is where For a few Dollars more comes into play. The story is freshened out. The characters have more depth and the final showdown is remarkable. The introduction of Lee Van Cleef is a savour. He enables the audience to dive into Clint's enigmatic characters when the pair converse, discovering that compared to Cleef, he just a rookie with some impressive traits.The villain, played by the same actor is developed and has a engaging story from his past for us too witness. The Hat scene and the final shoot out that leads to the inevitably , riveting showdown are all impressive. Without a shadow of a doubt, Lee Van Cleef steals the thunder from Clint but there no point debating as with the pair together, they make a impressive team</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Story: The second part to the well know "dollar" trilogy. This time story centers about three characters: El Indio psychopathic, violent and aggressive bandit ridden with inner daemons. Bounty hunter and skilled marksman Douglas Mortimer, who has more important reasons to kill Indio, than just the money. And finally man with no name (this time sometimes called Monco). It is not clear whether it is the same as in the first part but that is not important. He is a bounty hunter and there is a big reward for Indio and hi gang. These three inevitably clash.Acting: Eastwood just seems to be made to play tough as nails gunfighters so he slips in his role with easiness and is very effective in it. Lee van Cleef is equally good as Colonel Mortimer. But best is Volonte and his depiction of El Indio who is really frightening in his madness. Rest of the cast (which includes Klaus Kinski) is also good.Direction and camera: The film is very dramatic, with effective pacing and very good camera.Music: Music is one of the best in a film I heard, Moriconne does not disappoint.Conclusion: Great film, even better than Fistful of dollars, I recommend it to all western fans.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>perhaps my most favorite western epic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With its music dialogs , action and acting ,for a few dollars more has proved to be my one most favorite western classics. Both Clint Eastwood and Lee van Cleef made fruitful efforts to make it a classic. I started to enjoy it from the beginning with the music then kept on enjoying till the end. Both of had their special style unique which is somehow rare today. Must watch this when you love Western epics. Plot has been quite gripping. Clint Eastwood being young in those times gave a marvelous look. His way of walk and talk is really unique. Even in this age the way sometimes he gives a glance he looks like the same 40-50 years back clint eastwood. I wasn't born in those times when this film was released, i also had seen good bad &amp; ugly, pale rider and unforgiven but perhaps it was the best of clint eastwood.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent Middle Piece of the Man With No Name Trilogy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For those unfamiliar, the Man With No Name Trilogy was a series of films made from 1964 to 1966, directed by Sergio Leone, starring Clint Eastwood, and with music by Ennio Morricone. For a Few Dollars More is the second film, following A Fistful of Dollars and preceding The Good, the Bad and the Ugly. It is not necessary to view the films in any particular order. With that cleared up, the review: this is an excellent effort from everyone involved and one of the best westerns out there. Eastwood stars as the bounty hunter Manco, the current identity of the Man With No Name. He encounters a rival hunter called Colonel Mortimer during his pursuit of Indio, a notorious criminal. Realizing that neither of them can take Indio alone, Manco and Mortimer decide to form an uneasy alliance to catch him. What follows is a beautifully shot, wonderfully scored, and well-acted adventure full of suspense and thrills. The finale, an extremely tense duel between Mortimer and Indio, with Manco not far away, must be seen to be believed. For a Few Dollars more has the advantage of costing a few dollars more than the previous movie, which suffered from a low budget. It's an overall superior movie, with a much more original story (A Fistful of Dollars took most of its story from the samurai flick Yojimbo), more expansive sets, grander music and a better cast. Although it's not as good as The Good, the Bad and the Ugly, For a Few Dollars More still holds up as one of the definitive westerns of the 1960s.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Emphaticaly made, brilliantly unfolded and utterly immersing; the picture is a near perfect western that is so much 'more' than just a few dollars.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Twelve months prior to the release of Leone's 1966 opus The Good, the Bad and the Ugly saw the second of his three "Dollars" films in For a Few Dollars More, nicely wedging itself in between said supposed prequel and 1964's A Fistful of Dollars. The films get progressively better, with the first a loose remake of something else about a loner wading into a town; beating up the Mexican bandits and then attempting to rescue a damsel, a wonderful film on its own but now more a fascinating example of Leone as he found his directorial feet. Seeing the 'trilogy' as a whole, The Good, the Bad and the Ugly is a culmination of Leone's sublime ability to work within an established western setting but implement similar plot ideas and a stark, episodic directorial style as he makes every sequence and scene his own as this sordid tale of mostly unpleasant people weaves their way to a bloody, confrontational climax.Like the subsequent 1966 film; For a Few Dollars More sees a lead, supposedly the same in all three, played by Clint Eastwood forge an uneasy alliance with another man as they seek out a grand prize; a prize they could split between them or steal for themselves from the other. The films share more with one another than just the style implemented by the director; here, Eastwood's character Monco teams up with Lee Van Cleef's army Colonol Douglas Mortimer as they chase down a Mexican bandit named El Indio (Volonté). Both films see these forged partnerships ultimately fighting a ruthless killing machine, a sadistic man whom enjoys the pain he and others inflict on people and nary batters an eyelid in following through with his actions when faced with the idea of cutting a family in two by way of killing some of its members; particularly aiding in having the two central players come across as more favourable than they actually are. The relations the characters share are in binary opposition to its 1966 cousin; there, an American with links to the army was perceived as the chief threat to both Eastwood's character and his ally, a Mexican bandit he teams up with named Tuco. Here, the bandit is the enemy and the army personnel the ally. One thing remains, that each of the two films are breathtaking in their imagery and direction as they weave a dramatic and involving path, leading us through a hostile perception of the old west to a form of satisfying closure effortlessly tying up various strands.We begin with a straight comparison between the pairing which will come top forge the path the film's story will take. Van Cleef, clad in black and with that ominous expression, sits on a train and gets off at a station of his choice after illegally activating the emergency stop. People he interacts with seem scared on him, a barking train guard stopping dead in his tracks when he sees it's Colonol Mortimer leading his horse off the train and into town. He's a bounty hunter, and goes after a criminal who is wanted by the law; this bandit occupies the same area his wanted posters litter, suggesting an overly confident; unhinged, almost sociopathic, persona-come-attitude in that he's in such close proximity to the zone he's wanted by the local law. When the Colonol, carrying an array of rifles and guns we feel he cannot wait to use, takes him on and beats him with relative ease the ability and temperament of the man is finely established. On another strand is Monco who's also a bounty hunter, his chosen target is playing cards in a tavern and a methodical approach from the man sees him breeze in up to the game and engage in a cheeky card turning trick which provokes his target; Monco only turning when provoked to murderous brute force in which degrees of hard bodiedness are required.The two of them share an uneasy relationship, initially. A scene in a room the two of them occupy sees each of the men uneasily shift around discussing their alliance, each of them swapping positions of being seated as the other looms over them whilst still standing; suggesting a state of oneupmanship in which both are evenly matched and exchanging positions of power. Eventually, they seem to share some common ground through dialogue and both of them seat themselves down opposite one another suggesting a now agreed relationship. Leone highlights this in a physical sense with an surreal hat shooting contest, something perhaps not entirely necessarily given what plays out in the aforementioned scene. The gun-toting, gang sporting, child harming, family killing Mexican terrorist named El Indio is their target; someone with a bounty on their head's after having been broken out of jail by his gang early on, whom then all take refuge in a church so as to lay low and plan a bank heist. The locale of the church and Leone's placing of El Indio at one point in a pulpit suggests a sense of hierarchy within his own circles, with an additional a sense of them following him as he leads the sermon.Leone's ability to provide us with Mortimer and paint an image of him through other people's reactions and his own interactions with things around him before bringing it all round and humanising him with a back story is wonderful. One other sequence greatly subscribes to a certain theory pioneered by Hitchcock, about men sitting at a table with a bomb underneath it; in that a wall of a bank set to blow is teasingly shot with an array of long-shots of the building, close ups of an unsuspecting guard inside and face of the bounty hunters, all accompanied with distorted and uncharacteristic sound effects and music as we are denied what is expected to happen. Through the trilogy, Leone cemented a directorial legacy; through For a Few Dollars More, Leone makes the marvellous look effortless.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well made and a bit deeper than you'd expect</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You could think, that a story about two bounty hunters after a same criminal would be rather straight forwarded tale about men, who do anything to get money. And in a sense you'd be right, but at the same time you'd be wrong.Douglas Mortimer (Lee Van Cleef) is a no nonsense kind of a man, who is killing criminals in order to get money. So is Monco (Clint Eastwood). Mortimer is older and more experienced, Monco is younger and more reckless. And they both have a same goal, but also a different purpose to aim to that goal. The more moral victory of the story goes to Mortimer, despite they both do their fair amount of smacking the arses of ruthless men of psychotic murderer El Indio (Gian Maria Volonté).The main cast does remarkable job. Especially Volente manages to create truly loathsome villain, who isn't afraid to get really dirty in order to get what he wants. Out of the heroes Lee Van Cleef manages to outshine Eastwood in this one, though Clint does manage to keep his own as well. The supporting cast is also well thought of, including famous German trouble maker Klaus Kinski.All the Leone western trademarks are fully present, including Morricones fabulous music and the long, well drawn gun duels. There's probably a bit more humour in the mix than in the The Good, The Bad and The Ugly, though none of the Leones movies are with out his a bit dark sense of humour.All in all, For A Few Dollars More will always be among my favourite westerns.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Such as a few more dollars increases your money this movie increases the awesomeness of Clint Eastwood</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Better than A Fistful by a longshot, this movie introduces Lee Van Cleef, another competitor to the Man With No Name, except he is on the side of good. This great western adds a haunting and mysterious tone to its already impressive cast and awesome anti hero and makes itself memorable. The meaning of the chimes issuing from the watch of Indio and the backstory is revealed only at the end at the right time. There are no over active outbursts and Clint Eastwood plays it cool while kicking butt and still getting the loot. Lee Van Cleef gains new ground with his impressive performance and character role in support to the Man with No Name. He almost...almost takes away the glory that is to be Clint's and establishes his position among the stars of the 1960s. All in all if you ever see Clint you'd better get some coffins ready.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The second instalment of Sergio Leone's dollar trilogy "For A Few Dollars More" happens to be my favourite of the three, and that of the Spaghetti western genre. However at first it wasn't the case, as I did prefer the sweeping milestone "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly" and the pioneering "A Fistful of Dollars"? but over time from the first time I saw it (and it was the first one I saw of the three) until now I've really grown fond of the follow-up to put it up there above the rest.A squinting Clint Eastwood would return to his trademark role that got him noticed as the lone bounty hunter with the poncho and chewed up cigar "The man with no name" -- although he's known as Monco here, along with Gian Maria Volonte in another principle villain roll Indio -- a dope smoking, but venomous bandit with a cackling laugh. Joining them is bad-ass actor Lee Van Cleef as an opposing bounty hunter Colonel Mortimer with a hidden agenda. Van Cleef emit's a steely mood, which works off Eastwood's laconic presence that's even more inscrutable. Both want Indio --- who'll get him first and that means eliminating each other for that prize. So they come to the option of teaming up to see Indio and his outlaws' dead or alive. Leone really does focus on the impetuously odd relationship that forms between these two central characters and the dialogues exchanged (while quite sparse and to the point) shows the growing admiration in what they can see they're quite alike. So when Volonte's flamboyant character finally comes to the party and the three separate paths come to one. It does make for one memorable climax with Ennio Morricone's musical score packing an emotional punch, where all three separate instinctive music themes for the characters seem merge into one and the story's themes open up. Something about this effort feels more personal with its characteristics lending a hearty vibe to its brutal lashings.Leone's novel emphasis is on the dramatic visuals effectively told through brash editing and elastic cinematography that perfectly framed a violent breed of western that was complemented by its harsh dry locations painting a local décor flavour and rich colour tone. On this aspect alone, he spawned a genre. The soap opera story has more scope than the previous outing, in what is more a brazen character journey piece with what starts off as a waiting game that enters conniving turns and lighting-quick standoffs while following two anti-heroes in what is everyman looking after themselves. While not as compact and lean as the first, its inflated nature doesn't make it feel any longer and Leone's material is instrumentally harrowing. The starch, but slight script consists of a wry sense of humour and customary biting exchanges. Morricone's soaring music is excitingly cued, but also the sound effects of the gun crackling and bullets whistling are jarringly pitched.Klaus Kinski also shows up, and is rather distinguishable with a hunchback as one of the hot-tempered outlaws with a malicious glee in his eyes and Luigi Pistilli as well plays a gang members too.Leone's "For A Few Dollars More" is an ambitious, stirring and flashy Italian spaghetti western entertainment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cool, Stylish Spaghetti Western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"For a Few Dollars More" is the second part of Sergio Leone's "Dollars" trilogy, the films which made an international star of Clint Eastwood and introduced American audiences to the concept of the "spaghetti western". As in the other two instalments, Eastwood portrays the "Man with No Name", a mysterious gunman distinguished by his brown poncho, cigar and stubbly beard, more mercenary morally ambiguous than the traditional Western hero. In this episode the Man with No Name is a bounty hunter in pursuit of a ruthless bandit known as "El Indio".The film also introduced a second iconic Western star, Lee Van Cleef. Van Cleef was five years older than Eastwood, but his career had stalled after he was injured in a serious car accident in 1958. Here he plays character known as the "Man in Black", who is also in pursuit of El Indio. Like Eastwood's character, Van Cleef's is calm, deliberate and laconic and a lethal gunfighter. In other respects, however, the two men are very different. For a start, the Man in Black has a name and a past. We learn that his name is Colonel Douglas Mortimer and that he was originally a Southern gentleman from the Carolinas. In keeping with his gentlemanly status he is always smartly dressed in a black suit. He seems to be a bounty hunter- early in the film we see him killing an outlaw named Guy Calloway for the bounty of $1000- but towards the end we learn that he may have other, personal, reasons for wanting El Indio dead.Of the first two instalments of the trilogy I prefer "For a Few Dollars More" to "A Fistful of Dollars". (I have not seen "The Good, The Bad and The Ugly" for many years, so I will wait until I have seen it again before I decide which of the three is my favourite). Despite being very influential when it came out, the first film can seem today like little more than a run-of-the-mill Western. "For a Few Dollars More" is more than that. There are some effective touches, such as the strange quasi-duel where Mortimer shows off his skill with a gun by shooting at the "Man with No Name"'s hat, and the recurring motif of a musical pocket watch. (El Indio has such a watch that he plays before engaging in duels). Leone makes effective use of the contrasting styles of his two heroes- I call them that, despite their apparent amorality, because we are clearly intended to root for them against the brutal sadism of El Indio and his gang- and handles the action well, leading up to an enthralling climax. (The action in "A Fistful of Dollars", by contrast, can sometimes be confusing). Overall this is a cool, stylish Western. 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic Western!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Once again, Clint, you haven't let me down. For a Few Dollars More is a triumphant second installment to Sergio Leone's infamous, and by infamous I mean that in a great way, trilogy. This film proves to be just as entertaining as A Fistful of Dollars and yet For a Few Dollars More is a better film. There is plenty of gunfighting in this film and nobody can't be entertained by the wild showdowns that two partnered bounty hunters face on their journey to capture a lethal bandit named Indio. Once again, no words can describe how inspiring this film is. Unfortunately, I was only able to watch A Fistful of Dollars once, but now I am free to watch For a Few Dollars More over and over again. Clint Eastwood's portrayal as the Man with No Name proves to be superb and inspiring. A true western classic that no western fan, especially a Clint Eastwood one, should miss. I wouldn't have missed this film for the world and I am looking forward to watching the conclusion of Eastwood and Leone's infamous trilogy; The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly, which I know will the most impressive of the three. Eastwood and Leone haven't let me down and they never will. Perhaps Eastwood's performance in westerns may still prove superb even without the assistance of Italian director Sergio Leone. But the two of them side by side help them film Eastwood's most classic westerns and above all, his most classic films of his career. Bravo, Eastwood. Bravo</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A sequel not made for a few dollars more</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In Sergio Leone's sequel to A Fistful of Dollars his real talent really starts to shine out. I think the first 'dollars' film suffered from the fact that its plot was stolen from Akira Kurosawa's Yojimbo. This, however is a completely original movie and I'm very glad that it is. Some of Leone's trademarks, such as the use of a 'good' a 'bad' and an 'ugly' character are shown here for the first time. The surprise here is that this time around Clint Eastwood isn't actually the good one. Lee van Cleef might look sinister in his black clothes, his impressive weapons arsenal and really seems at first like the bad guy, but as the story progresses, we learn that he is, in fact, fighting for good reasons, unlike Clint who is only killing for money. El Indio is a very good bad guy, but not as memorable as Lee van Cleef and Henry Fonda would later be. See, I can't even remember the actor's name! There's not very much bad to say about this. The plot has enough twists to keep you interested, it has some great side characters (the hunchback, played by the craziest actor ever, Klaus Kinski and the old man living by the railroad come to mind), incredibly good music (Ennio Morricone could be the greatest movie composer ever!) and of course, Leone's ace directing (look at the cut from a laughing Indio to a wanted poster!).If I had to teach someone what a spaghetti western actually is, I would show this film. It's just a very good film compared to the absolutely brilliant the Good, the Bad and the Ugly and Once Upon a time in the West, but it isn't as epic as both of those films are, either. Highly recommended. ***** The Best Part (spoiler): The end duel might seem like a prototype to the one in the end of GB&amp;U, but it's still brilliant with the use of the music box tunes and Ennio Morricones usual Spanish guitar and choir. But maybe the scene where Clint and Lee shoot at each others hats takes the cake.</fullReview>

I think this is even better than GBU in many respects. The smaller more personal vendetta has real human emotion to it. Van Cleef and Eastwoods tenuous bond is another highlight. Leones direction is again brilliant in the detail it brings to situations. What other film has Lee Van Cleef, Clint Eastwood and Klaus Kinski in the same scene!! Morricone delivers another fantastic score. The final duel with the musical watch is sheer magic. Glad this finally made into the top 250.</fullReview>

Rival bounty hunters (Eastwood and Van Cleef) compete for the scalp of vicious bandit El Indio (Volonte) before striking an uneasy alliance to catch their man.Leone's trademark motifs are all present and correct: taciturn, sweat-drenched men of dubious morals scurry through panoramic landscapes to Morricone's artful, twanging score. The film also includes social concerns of Church and family that were absent in 'A Fistful..'. Clint is Clint, but Lee Van Cleef's black-hearted Colonel Mortimer is memorably sinister. Psychopathic though the main characters are, the film is also charged with a mordant sense of humour that refreshes its gun-slinging machismo. Look out for Klaus Kinski, unexpectedly cast as a grovelling hunchback.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Leone at His Most Assured; The 'Six Sense' of Westerns</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Why is 'For a Few Dollars More' a great western? What makes a great western? While 'Unforgiven,' 'Dances With Wolves, 'The Wild Bunch' and 'The Good, the Bad and the Ugly' have lofty ideas, so does 'The Big Country,' and it's not a particularly great western. Personal westerns like 'The Hired Hand' and, particularly, 'Heartland' don't possess particularly lofty ideas, but they are great westerns. So what is it? I'm not sure there is an answer.What I do know is that I've seen 'For a Few Dollars More' eleven times, which is more than I've seen 'Unforgiven,' 'The Wild Bunch,' 'The Good, the Bad and the Ugly,' 'Once Upon a Time in the West' and 'Dances With Wolves' put together. Is it because 'For a Few Dollars More' is entertaining? It most certainly is, but so are these other films, especially 'The Good, the Bad and the Ugly.' I think I love 'For a Few Dollars More' so much because, in addition to being beautifully written, it shares that hallmark gimmick so beautifully executed in 'The Six Sense;' that being, magic. By magic I mean the art of distraction. In both cases, the story we are watching is so satisfying, we aren't expecting the twist at the end, even though it was always right under our noses.'For a Few Dollars More' is one of those rare sequels that's better than the original, 'A Fistfull of Dollars'. The only other great sequels that can make that claim are 'The Empire Strikes Back' and 'The Godfather: Part II' . All three films succeed for the same reason: they use the audience familiarity with the characters and style to expand the storyline. Since we know at some point 'The Man With No Name' (Clint Eastwood) will show up, we can sit through the lengthy exposition which introduces two new main characters, 'The Man in Black' (Lee Van Cleef) and 'El Indio' (Gian Maria Volante). Both characters are compelling, Volante, especially. Indio is one of the darkest, vicious, tormented villains in the movies. Volante is so good we quickly forget he played the main villain, Ramon, in 'A Fistfull of Dollars. Van Cleef's bounty hunter, 'The Man in Black' is almost James Bondish with his assorted weapons and gadgets. However, Van Cleef's persona and looks gives the character a sense of suspenseful ambiguity. CAN this man in black be trusted? Eastwood's 'Man With No Name' is a more ruthless, treacherous character than he was in 'Fistfull of Dollars'. The opening scene, before the titles, shows and off-camera Eastwood bushwacking a bounty. Eastwood repeatedly betrays Van Cleef after the two bounty hunters join forces; he probably feels compelled to do so because 'The Man in Black' is consistently one step ahead of him. Leone takes great care contrasting the styles of the two bounty hunters. When Van Cleef researches Eastwood, he searches the newspapers until finding an article with a picture of the closing scene in 'Fistfull of Dollars; this establishes 'The Man in Black' as a more cerebral, systematic professional; it also reminds the audience of the first movie. When Eastwood researches Van Cleef, 'The Man With No Name' goes to see an old gossip, 'Prophet'. The scene between 'Prophet' and 'No Name' is initially funny; Leone does this to loosen up the audience, so Prophet's story about 'The Man in Black' is more affecting. 'Mortimer. Colonel Douglas Mortimer,' Prophet says, with a touch of sadness. 'The Man in Black' is genteel Southern aristocracy, a war hero, who's life dramatically changed over one tragic incident. Prophet doesn't tell us what that incident is, and it's mentioned only once by Eastwood and Van Cleef before the surprising climax of 'For A Few Dollars More'. While Leone establishes his dark villain 'Indio' as a sadistic psychopath, he and Volante create a character of surprising melancholy. An tragic incident, revealed by a series of increasingly descriptive flashbacks reveals Indio's life and happiness has been forever changed. Indio doesn't feel remorse for the incident; such a animal is incapable of guilt. Instead, Indio feels a great sense of loss, a loss so emotionally wrenching, Indio stays doped-up in order to endure.Indio plans to rob the bank of El Paso, and 'No Name' and Mortimer plan to capture him and his gang for the bounty. The robbery is a masterwork of editing comparable to the shower scene in 'Psycho'. Indio and his gang escape and 'No Name' and Mortimer set out after them. Mortimer has a genuine affection for 'No Name'. Just as well, since it's obvious Mortimer could easily kill 'No Name'. To reveal more would spoil the fun and there is a great deal of fun to be had in 'For a Few Dollars More.'Leone died at the age of 60, too young for such a man of genius. He directed only 13 films, three of which are bonafide masterpieces, 'For a Few Dollars More,' 'The Good, The Bad &amp; The Ugly' and 'Once Upon a Time in the West'. Those three films were made within an astonishing 36 months. While both 'Once Upon a Time in the West' and 'The Good, The Bad &amp; The Ugly' have grander themes (and much bigger budgets), neither is as well focused and surprising as 'For a Few Dollars More'. I give 'For a Few Dollars More' a '10'.Reading about Leone at the IMDb website, I was astonished to discover that two of his western films were never fully released in the US, 'The Magnificent Stranger' and 'The Genius'. Would somebody PLEASE put these movies on DVD? Leone permanently transformed the face of the American western. I'd certainly like to see these two 'lost' examples of his work.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had never quite realized how Leone influenced Tarantino, but it was obvious when I watched the flick this time around. Even the flavour of the movie was reminiscent of Kill Bill. The one liners, the close ups, the marvelous stylistic excess. Great movie of epic proportions, in many ways. A little slower than i remembered, but with some classic scenes. Shooting the hats, shooting the apples, shooting the cigar. Lee Van Cleef's yellow pipe. I find the spaghetti western style so fun and exuberant and it shows a real love of movie-making. Apparently Jimmy Stewart hated spaghetti westerns. I can see why. They take the p*ss out of the old classic westerns, exaggerating everything. But a beautiful attention to detail, and all the close ups are just marvelous. The old west was such a minefield for film-making. It's really amazing. Old west stories take on such epic proportions because good vs. bad was so clearly delineated. Life was simpler, everyone owned a gun. Western tales are archetypal.It was really nice having Kinski in a spaghetti western. A little surreal. I didn't realize it the first time around. And I appreciate the dubbing. It adds a hyper real quality that accentuates the cartoony feel of the whole enterprise. Leone films are truly original. This was my second time around with this one, and although the pace was a little slow for me to stay totally focused, I enjoyed the music; the whistling; the haunting melody of the watch. It's all about the details. Inspiring.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Small World...And Very, Very Bad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The middle section and niftiest of the "Man With No Name" trilogy starring Clint Eastwood, "For A Few Dollars More" is the breakpoint where the series jumps from effective revenge drama into more ethereal, epic territory. If it's not as great as the third film, "The Good, The Bad, And The Ugly," it's still one of the most brilliant westerns, spaghetti or otherwise, ever made.The plot this time is more convoluted than it was the first time out, in "A Fistful Of Dollars." A bounty hunter who goes by the name "Monco" (Eastwood) gets on the trail of a crazed killer named Indio (Gian Maria Volante) and his gang, only to find another bounty hunter, Col. Mortimer (Lee Van Cleef), is just as close, and even more intent on collecting the reward for Indio's demise.The mood of the spaghetti western, that of a world where life being cheap except for those who collect money for taking it, is firmly established early on, where we witness a seemingly random killing during the opening credits, followed by several more courtesy of Monco and the Colonel. Monco at least seems willing to try to take his prey back alive, whereas the Colonel is less fussy. Director Sergio Leone made an effective vehicle with "Fistful Of Dollars," one that launched Eastwood as a major star, but it is here he begins to make the case for a complex vision of the western as an existential stage for man's villainy, glory, and doom all at once.Calling it a spaghetti western makes it sound cheap. Sure, it's Italian, but if you have to note the country of origin, wouldn't it be better to call it a "horse opera?" The long, drawn-out pauses that establish mood, the way different parts create their own tone which meld seamlessly into the next, the complications in the unfolding of the narrative that set up exciting alternatives to audience expectations, the sense of divine judgment in a world where the existence of divinity itself seems in question, and finally that incredible Morricone score (much more diversified than we heard in "Fistful," with some recognizable melodies and nice use of off-tones like the harmonica and that everpresent Jew's harp) all point to something with the heft and scale of Verdi. It's a western unlike anything that came before.Another welcome development is the humor. We got bits of that in "Fistful," like Clint's reaction when he slugs a woman by mistake, but here there's some sections where the audience is encouraged to laugh even as the foreboding, alien mood of death and grief is being established. Like Manco's brief moment with the old man, "Prophet," which has some nice eye-rolling from the tight-faced gunman; and the memorable match-lighting moments between Van Cleef and a nasty little hunchback played by Klaus Kinski. (Sauerkraut western?) Even Indio cracks wise on occasion, as when Cuchillo discovers where his knife went. "That shouldn't be there, should it?" he asks, almost innocently, though with appropriate menace.There are some logic gaps in the storyline, though they are not as distracting on repeat viewings as the ones in "Fistful." Volante has some effective moments as Indio, but then he goes over the top in other scenes. I think letting him wear the Adam Ant eyeliner in prison was a mistake, and so is an odd section of Morricone's score early on where he throws in some "Dracula" organ music. These are quibbles, and not enough for me to deny that it's my favorite Leone western. But taking a broader view, it's not as good as "The Good, The Bad, And The Ugly," with the important insertion of Tuco's character, the Civil War backdrop, and a more effective and deliberate focus on the role of God in such a world as this. But if few movies of any kind are as good as `The Good, Bad, And Ugly,' this is a stirring establishment of the themes that film would work very hard and well at resolving.The best thing in this film is the relationship between Eastwood's character and Van Cleef's. It's a dance of distrust, and as much as Monco sets himself up as the antagonist, you have to wonder what the preternaturally poised Col. Mortimer has up his sleeve. Is he really playing it the way he says? Clearly he has some hidden motive, and given Van Cleef's sinister, devil-like visage, so effectively set up in the early scenes, you can't really blame Monco for his suspicions. All this is in the way of setting up one of the most satisfying resolutions in any western, where Leone makes his case for a director worthy of John Ford's heavy mantle.Has it really been 40 years since this came out? Funny this was the offspring of a Kurosawa imitation, since as a '60s icon, the No Name trilogy has become imitated on a scale second only to the Beatles. Tarantino, Scorsese, Raimi, the list goes on. As was said of the famed architect Christopher Wren, if you want to see Sergio Leone's memorial, just look around.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The thriller spaghetti western...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Per qualche dollaro in pliu" (or "For a Few Dollars More") is the second entry in Sergio Leone's 'Man With No Name' trilogy, the first being "For a Fistfull of Dollars" and the last being "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly". Each of these movies is a classic, everybody who sees them loves them, including me. What I find interesting is how the movies get progressively better as they go on. "For a Fistfull of Dollars" was stylish and cool, but not great. "For a Few Dollars More" is both stylish and great, and, well, "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly" is the best.But right now I'm doing a review on "For a Few Dollars More". The story has bounty hunters Monco (Clint Eastwood) and Col. Douglas Mortimer (Lee Van Cleef) arriving in El Paso, looking for psychotic outlaw El Indio (Gian Mario Volonte). When they arrive they become rivals of sorts, before finally teaming up to stop El Indio and his gang.Of course, that's just the beginning. From there the plot twists and turns, this is truly a "Thriller" movie. So many times I was taken by surprise - none of which I can spoil here. All I can say is that this movie is certainly unpredictable.And it is executed perfectly by Leone's wonderful style. His long pauses, haunting music (compliments of Ennio Morricone) and use of gunshot noise whenever a major plot point is revealed may seem campy on paper, but anyone who sees this film will certainly change their mind.That's just the director, the three leads all put forth too. Eastwood gives what I think is his best performance of the trilogy, we get our best look at his otherwise cold, callous character. Cleef is great too, his character is so cool and much more likable than his "The Bad".But Volonte, he does the best. If this movie was released in America and not dubbed he would have no doubt garnered an Oscar nomination. He plays the psychotic Indio with a quiet, calm and yet terrifying presence, he is certainly one of the best cinematic villains - ever.This may not be as good as "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly", but it comes really, really close, 8.5/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the greatest films of all time.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like all of Leone's films, "For a Few Dollars More" is just as brilliant as GBU and OUAITW. The story has more direction, and is more tightly integrated as a whole in comparison to other films in the dollars trilogy. If you haven't seen it, see it today, and hope for a better DVD transfer soon!Every "famous" modern day director has taken influences from Leone's work, but have never topped it. Nitpicking any of Leone's films is like nitpicking Mozart or Michelangelo. Only Kurosawa can come close to Leone, and if there is an eternity, only he is worthy of washing his Leone's feet.It's too bad he made so few films.Also, this film wouldn't be half of what it is without Morricone or Eastwood. Both are absolutely topnotch here.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Arguably the Best of the Eastwood/Leone Trilogy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For a two hour, eleven minute movie, "For a Few Dollars More" sings! In the immortal words of MSGT Ernie Bilko, "It has that Air Force sweep!" This movie along with "Fistful of Dollars" launched fads like bell-bottoms, platform boots [look for them in a few frames.] and crooked little cigars. I've known guys who have seen this movie ten or twenty times - me included - in order to memorize the incredible macho lines from the great writers. Even Clint Eastwood co-wrote "Fistful of Dollars" by simplifying much of the dialog. The writing is tight and humorous yet speaks volumes. Some of the very best parts of scenes had little or no dialog whatsoever, only facial expressions coupled with slight body or head movements that more than got the points across. The music in this movie is arguably the best of the trilogy all having been written by Ennio Morricone.The bar scene with Lee Van Cleef provoking Klaus Kinsky while Morricone's music is poking fun is a scream. Lost in all of this good humor is the ultra violence - without much blood so you know that it was made for Europeans who aren't bothered by sex like American critics pretend that Americans are. This movie even has one or two frames of partial nudity that even the Puritanical American critics surprisingly missed because it involved breasts [oh-m-gaud] - a no-no in 1968 when it was released in America after The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly. A strong portion of the story develops around an incredibly vicious outlaw named El Indio [The Indian] - including dream sequences - played by Gian Maria Volonte by giving one of the strongest performances in cinematic history as a man you love to hate - "I know. You hate me just enough."Most European editors - especially from Eastern Europe - don't waste time destroying 45% of a movie by making it fit into the size of the television screen as in America while paradoxically American editors and critics love to dictate to you what you are allowed to see. See this flick in letterbox only or you will miss out on superb subtleties that make rewatching a pleasure as you see things that you missed like the final showdown that is reminiscent of "The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly" in the circular arena with the three protagonists instead of one man and two noses.My wife is a great bell weather for this movie because she hates macho, violent movies - especially westerns. She now ranks this movie just under "The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly" along with "Dr. No", "The In-laws", anything with Harrison Ford or Catherine Deneuve [whom she resembles facially] and anything about Russia.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sergio Leone and Clint Eastwood's second best classic spaghetti western masterpiece!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Disclaimer: If you are a viewer that mainly prefers art-house-type movies, then you might as well ignore this review. In addition, if you're not able to take Sergio Leone and Clint Eastwood's second best classic spaghetti western masterpiece, ignore this review, as well. We'll both be better off.For a Few Dollars More (1965) is the best Clint Eastwood Western movie and one of my favorite classic western flicks ever! I grew up watching this film and it was the first Clint Eastwood western movie I ever saw, I fall immediately in love with it and I just love this movie. For me in the Dollars Trilogy the best one will always be this one For a Few Dollars More. It is entraining and brilliant western flick with a great original epic story, great cast and the acting is fantastic. You have a great shoot outs, the music score is original epic. I always enjoy this film. It is my favorite Eastwood western movie. In my opinion It is Sergio Leone and Clint Eastwood's classic film that they ever made together. Westerns like this film doesn't exit this days anymore. Most of the people are going for third entry of the Dollars Trilogy or "The Man With No Name Trilogy" The Good, the Bad and the Ugly I don't! I have enjoyed For a Few Dollars More much better than I have enjoyed the third film The Good, the Bad and the Ugly. I love this one to death, I don't like the third movie.The film is very entertained, is not boring and It has a good plot and story to tell. The characters, the action shooting sequences are just amazing and awesome. Sergio Leone does what he wanted to do with the film, and become one of the greatest epic classic western movies. I love this movie to death and it is my favorite film! There are other western films that Clint Eastwood made and directed but this one will be one of his best films in the history ever.Plot: Two bounty hunters Monco (Clint Eastwood) and Col. Douglas Mortimer (Lee Van Cleef) with the same intentions team up to track down a Western outlaw El Indio (Gian Maria Volonté) and his gang.The first film was more about one hero but in this film there are two heroes. The bullets, the shooting is outstanding. The gun fights are awesome. This is a Western that simply delivers the goods, and it does so with a spectacular marriage of style and substance. From the opening scenes with Cleef and Eastwood, to the scenes in El Paso, and then into the set pieces in the stone ruins in the Mexico desert, For a Few Dollars More displays the utmost skill by Leone in his storytelling, as well as in his use of the camera.The film is intelligent when Col. Douglas Mortimer suggested that the way to break the gang will be easy with one man from the inside of the gang (Monco) , because his younger. The story telling from El Indio about a carpenter who made a big closet were the safe was hiding in it was just plain brilliant.Monco breaks one of Indio's friends out of prison and is admitted to the gang, to prove his loyalty was awesome. The watch that Indio opens during the gun fight scenes and when the song stops by the watch he draw his gun and shoot anyone in the gun fight with him that was so awesome. The last showdown between Col. Douglas Mortimer and El Indio when the song stopped was TERRIFIC!Why I love this movie? Simply because of Clint Eastwood and Lee Van Cleef. I love Lee Van Cleef so much in here because he plays the good guy, he kills bunch of outlaws whit his riffle. He befriends Monco and he kills El Inido on the end. He doesn't split the reward with Monco , but he lets him have it, the money on a honest way. Clint Eastwood as Monco did a fantastic job in one of his best performances as Bounty Killer Monco. He also kills bunch of outlaws, he also shoot Mortimer's hat, he never shoots an Innocent or unarmed person, that is why I love this actor and his character so much. Gian Maria Volonté did a good job on another style he also never shoot unarmed person, he only did that once for a women he fall in love. Mortimer's sister, on the end of the film it was reveled why Col. Douglas Mortimer was hunting El Indio and his gang. He was doing it for both: Justice and Revenge, while Monco just wanted to get money and become rich, but he changed his mind after he saw how Indio is evil and cruel person. The gun fight between Col. Douglas Mortimer and Juan Wild - The Hunchback ( Klaus Kinski) in the bar was fantastic! How Col. Douglas Mortimer killed him. I love this film to death I love it! Sergio Leone did a fantastic job directing this awesome flick in fact I think it is his masterpiece. The film that changed the western movies today and I love the music score from Ennio Morricone. The dialogue and the script was amazing, the weapons used in this film are awesome and they are used well. Action is plenty in the film.What else do you want in an spaghetti Western film like this at all?! The fact is this is the greatest western ever made in the history. I love this film to death!10/10 Grade: Bad Ass Seal Of Approval Studio: Produzioni Europee Associati (PEA), Arturo González Producciones Cinematográficas, Constantin Film Produktion Starring: Clint Eastwood, Lee Van Cleef, and Gian Maria Volonté.

		<shortDescription>Very good second instalment in the Dollars Trilogy which just falls short of the brilliant The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In this second instalment in the dollars trilogy, we follow bounty killers Monco (Clint Eastwood)and Colonel Douglas Mortimer (Lee Van Cleef). Initially, both men work separately picking up reasonable bounties for reasonably notorious criminals. However, when both men discover that there is a $10,000 reward for capturing notorious outlaw El Indio, they both set to work in tracking him down.I think the Dollars Trilogy is probably the only Trilogy I've ever watched where the films have gradually improved as they've progressed. The first film was reasonably good, this second film was very good and the third film was outstanding. I suspect that Leone must have studied each film and looked at ways that he can further improve each of the sequels. I'm clearly not alone in this thought process as the IMDb ratings (at the time of writing this review) for each of the films are 8.1, 8.3 and 9.0 respectively. There isn't a weak film in this trilogy, but as mentioned it's noticeable that there was a steady improvement in quality.For a Few Dollars More has all the trademark qualities that we've come to expect; tension, humour, a good story, interesting characters. I've always felt Leone has his tongue firmly in his cheek when he makes these films and it's clear that he had a lot of fun making this trilogy. Leone also seemed to have a gift for creating tension from the most simple of situations; take the scene where a gang member blows Mortimer's match out and Mortimer just stands there staring at this man. I was sat there thinking what was he going to do? What's going to happen? This scene probably only lasted for a minute and was created out of nothing, but it's effectiveness was remarkable. Likewise, the same could be said for the early scene with Eastwood with the playing cards - a remarkably tense and well executed scene.The part of the film that I was most looking forward to was the inevitable showdown between Eastwood and Van Cleef. I honestly believe that these two guys were amongst the coolest leading men of that era. What made this showdown so brilliant is that it was tense when it needed to be tense and was hysterical when it needed to be funny. I won't spoil what happens in this scene, but let's just say that it won't be what you're expecting. It had me in stitches.Aside from all of the plus points noted above, this film like the first film and the third film in the trilogy also has that wonderful Ennio Morricone score.There really is very little to criticise this film about, but the only negative thing about this film is that I felt that the last 30 minutes was a bit too drawn out. Thankfully, there is enough tension to hold your interest, but the finale went on a bit long in my opinion. Aside from that, For a Few Dollars More is pretty much flawless.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why choose this "Spaghetti Western"?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For a Few Dollars More, is part of a trilogy of films by director Sergio Leone starring Clint Eastwood. In this film, "Monco" played by Clint Eastwood, and Colonel Douglas Mortimer played by Lee Van Cleef are bounty hunters chasing the same bounties, namely one El Indio (The Indian) played by Gian Maria Volonte.As one of the so called "spaghetti westerns" I personally feel that it was better in story and context than the previous Fistful of Dollars but not quite as good as The Good, the Bad and the Ugly. In cinematic terms the director utilized parallel cuts at different points in the film when the scene jumps back and forth from Monco to Colonel Mortimer throughout the entire movie. The extreme close-up shots were seen through the entire film as well, such as when El Indio laughs hysterically about some evil deed or another that he perpetrated. This is especially noted early on in the film when they freeze frame on El Indio's face and then the screen darkens into a wanted poster. Leone also uses inside/out editing to his benefit at multiple places within the film. The one that stands out the most is when El Indio and Monco are talking as the camera comes in for a close-up shot. When we fade back out from their faces we are transferred to a totally different location in an establishing shot of the new location at an abandoned adobe town.The use of lighting in the filming of this movie was done quite extraordinarily. The majority of the light seems to be natural lighting as they are outdoors. However, when they are filming their night shots the use of low-key lighting is well worth the effect they are attempting to create. There is one point where Monco's face is so dark that you will swear he has black face paint on (and he may) but as he descends into the light his face is just shadowed. The one effect that I have always enjoyed in Sergio Leone films is the use of music to heighten the scene. It is not like the music used in today's films because there are no accompanying lyrics to help set the mood, just the acoustics. In all three movies in the trilogy this is an apparent trend that sets the bar for all films to emulate.All in all if you enjoy Clint Eastwood films and Italian directors this movie is a must see for you. For a Few Dollars More is not my favorite of the trilogy by any means, but it is interesting to watch for the similarities and changes in Leone's directing style. Let's just say if it is on the television, I'm not going to change the channel to watch something else.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Life is cheap out in the Old West, unless you're a bounty hunter, in which case it's a profitable way to make a living. With so many roustabouts getting up to no good it was inevitable that Indio, the biggest and baddest of all, would attract the attention of two men with very different motives.Colonel Mortimer (Lee Van Cleef) and Monco (Eastwood) eventually cross paths and form a tenuous partnership to catch Indio, who has just been broken out of jail by his loyal men and is planning a big bank robbery. Mortimer and Monco work together, and against each other, in order to bring him in, and all his men, to maximize their rewards.It's a long film, but it has enough time to indulge in over-the-top moments. I especially like Clint and Van Cleef squaring up to each other by shooting hats. It's ridiculous, but good. Some of the widescreen photography is particularly memorable. It's all grainy, gritty stuff but it's a rough edge you just don't get anymore, which is a loss to modern movie which all just look too slick.Ennio Morricone also provides a wonderful score that's utterly timeless and turns many scenes into an overblown opera.I'm in the mood for Spaghetti now.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than "Fistful"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a very good movie, a big improvement over "A Fistful of Dollars". The increased budget is apparent. Better sets, more location footage and the presence of Lee Van Cleef.Here's what I liked:- Of course, the music score and visual style rule here, as in all Leone movies. Clint is amazing as usual.- Lee Van Cleef gives a very good performance. The character of Colonel Mortimer is complex and very well developed.- Klaus Kinski adds a lot of color to the movie as the demented hunchback outlaw.- Very clever interplay between "Manco" and Colonel Mortimer throughout. Leone is more successful here with the wit he attempted in "Fistful".- Nice Civil War tie-in with Mortimer.Here's what I didn't like:- Too much gratuitous graphic violence.- I wasn't that sold on a Mexican bandit group operating in New Mexico in 1865. I've read a lot about the Apache wars in this area during this period and I don't recall anything about violent gangs of Mexican robbers roaming the countryside.To make it even more confusing, the leader is named "El Indio", the Indian. May be the only "Indian" to ever appear in a Leone Western. Great, an Italian guy playing a Mexican bandit who's really an Indian - maybe.Like I said, with Leone, it's all about style......</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Film That Feels More Like a Lee Van Cleef Movie Rather Than a Clint Eastwood Film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sergio Leone's celebrated Spaghetti Western "Per qualche dollaro in pi?" (1965) isn't like the rest of the so-called "Dollars Trilogy". The great Lee Van Cleef is the first person after the titles you meet and you seen a lot the action through his eyes, rather that Clint Eastwood's. For example, its Lee Van Cleef you are with at the climatic shootout, not Eastwood. A another example is after Eastwood's character (Manco) betrays Lee Van Cleef's character (Col. Douglas Mortimer), it is Van Cleef sitting on top of a building pointing a gun at Eastwood, something that would probably happen the other way round in a different "Dollars" film. All in all, a one of the very greatest of the Spaghetti Westerns.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best of the trilogy, and that's saying a lot.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Most film majors, film scholars, wanna-be film experts, and film historians will credit whether Once Upon a Time in the West and/or The Good, the Bad, and Ugly as Leone's best work. Well, they are all wrong. Going by the instinct that my opinion is better than everyone else's, For a Few Dollars More is Leone at his peak, and one of the better westerns of all-time. Unlike the two films first mentioned, this one doesn't overstay its welcome, doesn't drift off into unnecessary scenes, and ultimately presents Eastwood (and Lee Van Cleef) at his top form. For a Few Dollars More is spaghetti western at its absolute finest, and should be viewed at least once by any fans of the wild west.For a Few Dollars More (No longer under the rage of Kurosawa) is about two bounty hunters after a vicious criminal that recently escaped from prison with the help of his friends. While Man With No Name (Eastwood, of course) is in it for the money, Mortimer's reasons seem a bit more blurred. The film becomes a massive cats-and-mice game as both bounty hunters compete to catch and kill the criminal first.All the elements that made A Fistful of Dollars work were improved upon here: the directing, cinematography, acting, pacing, and musical score. The close-ups, long shots, and quick edits are all Leone's signature, and yet again keep the movie moving and entertaining. The story is not only more original the second time around, but is deeper, and more engrossing.Geez Louise, can I discuss the music here? Morricone's music is truly epic and is twice as good as the first film in the trilogy, and arguably almost as good as his most popular score (The Good, the Bad and the Ugly). Whether it's the simple drumming during a stand-off, a bittersweet pocket watch song, or the fantastic theme in the beginning, Morricone's music should have earned him an Oscar that year (Does anybody even remember Doctor Zhivago's music?). Not only is it great music, but one of the best soundtracks of all-time. To this day the music's influence can be heard: Hans Zimmer's nods to him occur in the Pirates of the Caribbean series.Like the previous installment, there are no heroes in this tale; just a lot of ruthless men fighting each other to reach their just rewards. What makes Few Dollars More better than The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly are two main things: the pacing and the balance of characters. In The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly, the movie lasts more than 160 minutes and most of it is focused on The Ugly, by far the least interesting character. The Man With No Name doesn't even do much in the third installment, especially compared to this one. The other issue is pacing; the film like I previously stated is closing in on three hours. In this movie, a mere two hours, perfectly manageable two hours.Bottom Line: A great western with plenty of action and superb storytelling to sink your teeth into. Leone's directing is at his best here, Eastwood is gripping and entertaining, and Morricone's music is sure to leave you enchanted. Unlike Leone's later films that drag on endlessly, this film is well-paced and well-equipped with plenty of tension and excitement. Recommend to all those whom enjoy a good western that pulls no punches.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As Eastwood says in the finale, 'Bravo.'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Per qualche dollaro in pi?' AKA 'For A Few Dollars More' bears the curse of a middle sibling, overlooked while Sergio Leone's 'Fistful of Dollars' and mammoth-sized 'The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly' draw wider attention. This is not necessarily a bad thing, since anyone who watches 'For A Few Dollars More' with lower expectations has a chance of being surprised. Realizing the success of his original film, Leone put considerably more work into his script and direction this time around. 'For A Few Dollars More,' co-written mainly by Leone and Luciano Vincenzoni, develops its characters to a fuller extent, is based on a more expansive scale, and uses technical aspects such as editing, music, and sound to form a more cohesive, almost symphonic plot line.Once again, Leone does not specify a time for the action but names places in New Mexico and Texas. The story opens in Tucumcari, a small New Mexican town, where the Man With No Name (Clint Eastwood, called 'Monco' in this film) and former colonel Douglas Mortimer (Lee Van Cleef) arrive separately to ply their trade as bounty hunters. The men find wanted posters of El Indio (Gian Maria Volont?), a psychotic robber who is busted out of prison by his gang. Eastwood and Mortimer realize that the odds of a single man finishing off Indio's gang are slim; the men decide to work together and split $20,000 in reward money, should they walk away from the killings. Their plan to nab Indio at the central bank in El Paso fails, allowing him to get away with thousands of dollars and considerably upping the reward for his head. Eastwood and Mortimer lock horns as matters unfold, but wisely respect and depend upon each other's skills. We also learn that one of the bounty hunters carries a second and deeper-lying reason for tracking Indio down.While Eastwood remains a solid presence as the Man With No Name, Lee Van Cleef is superb as Mortimer, a refined, dapper individual who can gunsling with the best of them. Mortimer puts Eastwood's character in striking relief, undoing much of the superhero element that impels 'Fistful of Dollars.' He forms a rugged pair with Eastwood and reminds us that even the best fighters can use some help. Gian Maria Volont? has the thankless job of dying in back-to-back films but gives excellent character work as a rogue who has surrendered to inner demons and holds no sanctity for human life. Other actors return from 'Fistful of Dollars,' including Joseph Egger (as Old Prophet), Benito Stefanelli (Luke), and Aldo Sambrell (Cuccillo). Cult icon Klaus Kinski also has a role as gang member Wild the Hunchback.After shoe-stringing 'Fistful of Dollars,' Leone had a visibly larger budget in the second film. Again recorded in the Andalucía region of Spain, 'For A Few Dollars More' uses expansive outdoor settings and wide interiors while employing a larger cast and numerous extras. There is simply more room to work with and more things are going on, all presented in Leone's unique style. Leone shows greater confidence with his material, employing closeup, flashback, and deceptive angles quite liberally. The superior production values could only help cinematographer Massimo Dallamano, whose lens captured every nuance of the 'southwestern' heat. Ennio Morricone has great moments in 'Fistful of Dollars,' but the famed orchestrations come into their own during this sequel. By intermingling a large orchestra and chorus with aspects of the plot (especially the chimes of a stolen pocket watch), Morricone's score becomes a fourth main character who offers psychological insight.Admittedly, 'For A Few Dollars More' is pure gold for those who love errors - there are obvious goofs such as playing cards that look too new for the 19th century, missing teeth that reappear, and ignored historical facts (Tucumcari, New Mexico, didn't exist until 1901). The dubbing is just as bad as in 'Fistful of Dollars,' if not worse; Eastwood's own voice is out of sync at times and the dubbing of non-English actors is terrible. However, these problems do nothing to spoil Leone's overlying effort. 'For A Few Dollars More' is an absorbing experience in the western genre, rivaled only by his 'The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly' and 'Once Upon a Time in the West.' There are actually a large number of fans and critics who rate 'For A Few Dollars More' over 'The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly' because of its shorter running time (131 minutes) and more concentrated development.Western fans had a long stretch before the advent of DVD, when full frame VHS tapes and TV broadcasts robbed 'For A Few Dollars More' of its sharpness. MGM, who holds first rights to United Artists' library, released a DVD in 1998 that is closer to Leone's original vision. The disc, which is offered both individually and as part of a 'Man With No Name' boxed set, presents 'For A Few' in letterbox format (2.35:1) with Dolby enhancement of the original mono track; French 'dubbing' is offered with subtitles in English, French, and Spanish. 'For A Few Dollars More' has respectable print quality with only occasional grain and speckling; sound quality is very good, balancing dialogue, effects such as gunshots, and Morricone's ever-important score. The only extra is For A Few's trailer, which points out anglicized names taken by Volont? and Leone in 'Fistful of Dollars.' MGM has since released a two-DVD special edition with major restorations and supplements as part of the Sergio Leone Anthology. Either way, the film is highly recommended and a must for collectors.*** out of 4Roving Reviewer - www.geocities.com/paul_johnr</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Fans of Quentin Taratino need to watch the Sergio Leone trilogy: Fistful of Dollars, For a few Dollars More, and The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly to see what inspired him to the achievements he has made as a director.Fans of Clint Eastwood need no encouragement to see him in his early work on his way to stardom.Eastwood and Lee Van Cleef are bounty hunters on the trail of El Indio (Gian Maria Volont?). Eastwood is out for the money, but Van Cleef has other motives. Bullets fly, bodies are stacked like cord wood, and the action never stops all to incredible music by Ennio Morricone.Enjoy!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The icon of a generation has returned, in this perfect example of action and adventure that once was the west. Clint Eastwood returns as the man with no name, in this visionary and ace spaghetti western film: For a few Dollars More. Although simple in plot, Leone delivers an everlasting piece of drama, action and adventure. The role for Eastwood was so perfect, that the trilogy made him an international super star. Also starring in supporting cast but giving just as good entertainment is, Lee Vann Cleef as Colonal. Douglas Mortimer, who teams up with Eastwood to capture El Indio played by Gian Maria Volonte and his team of bandits as they travel through the plains of the devious west. Delivering ecstatic action, adventure and suspense at every level nothing could go wrong!!!!! All of this redefines the Spaghetti Western like never before, releasing cant look away cinema and non stop excitement.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Satisfying Spaghetti</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although For a Few Dollars More has all the trademark and inherent problems with Euro-Westerns (dubbing, locales, scenery-chewing, and everyone looking like they're from . . . Spain), I think it's the most emotionally satisfying of the Man With No Name trilogy. Clearly it's not an extension of A Fistful of Dollars, nor is it related to the biggest of the three, The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly, but it has its own independent story, and it's the most pleasing of the three movies on a thinking level. Here, Clint Eastwood is slightly eclipsed by Lee Van Cleef. They're both bounty hunters after the same criminal, but Van Cleef has personal issues with "Indio" while Eastwood just wants the cash. In the long run, we care more about Colonel Mortimer than Monco, and this gives FAFDM its unique quality, even if a "quality spaghetti western" is an oxymoron to you.Yet, Sergio Leone made Tuco in GBU more entertaining than Blondie. You want Blondie to get the gold, but not kill Tuco (although he sure deserves it!). By the end of FAFDM, you're rooting for the Van Cleef character; Eastwood is just a killing machine, much like his character in Where Eagles Dare. Whether or not this is what Leone wanted--or if he desired Van Cleef and Eastwood to be equals--I think most folks will have taken sides fairly early on.I didn't find this movie nearly as visually exciting as GBU and the preposterousness of some of the plotting and action may make you squirm or roll your eyes, but I recommend For a Few Dollars More because it's an emotionally satisfying western at its heart.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A few dollars more. Eastwood builds on a gritty character.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A FEW DOLLARS MORE is the second installment in the famous Sergio Leone trilogy. Plenty of gun-play with that trademark echo gun shot sound. The eerie and haunting musical score of Ennio Morricone keeps this ruthless western running for two hours and ten minutes. This unique sound will become evocative of the "spaghetti western" genre. Shootouts, stare-downs and relentless fist fights are plentiful. Monco(Clint Eastwood)and Col. Douglas Mortimer(Lee Van Cleef) are bounty hunters that try to out-wit the other in tracking down and turning in 'dead or alive' the ruthless villain Indio(Gian Maria Volonte). The finale is drama to the extreme as Mortimer and Indio have a showdown to the tune of the chimes of their pocket watches. Indio and his gang prove to be a fortune for the successful bounty hunter. Also in the cast: Luigi Pistilli, Benito Stefanelli, Rosemary Dexter and Lorenzo Robledo.Question: why does the 'man with no name' actually have a name?</fullReview>

I must say, my tastes are wide and varied. The "Manco Trilogy" are an acquired taste in film making. I'm 48 and have only become an admirer of these works in recent history.

		<fullReview>Clint Eastwood is The Man With No Name, a bounty hunter who calls himself Manco.He teams up with another bounty hunter, Col. Douglas Mortimer (Lee Van Cleef) to catch a villain called Indio (Gian Maria Volonté).There's the plot for this spaghetti western classic Per qualche dollaro in piú, or as it is known in English, For a Few Dollars More.This was the second part of the trilogy made by Sergio Leone.First there was A Fistful of Dollars and the last one was The Good, the Bad and the Ugly.In my opinion, this is one of the best trilogies ever made.Others include Back to the Future, Die Hard etc. Leone (1929-1989) was an amazing director.Another thing that makes these movies so great is the original music, that was made by Ennio Morricone.This legend will turn 76 next month and is still composing a masterpiece after another.The acting work is fabulous.Clint Eastwood never fails.He shined in this movie as he has done in many others.I would like to see this 74 year old actor/director in another western.But maybe Unforgiven was his farewell to westerns.Van Cleef (1925-1989) and Volonte (1933-1994) are both magnificent.There's also Klaus Kinski (1926-1991) as Wild, the Hunchback doing a great job. There are lots of unbelievable scenes in this movie.They don't make movies like this anymore.Watch this or you'll be sorry.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A previous commenter had noted: "I often had to wonder about those shooting at clothes and leaving those clothes without holes in them, especially that bedroom scene when the guy got all shot up and looks like nothing had entered his body." This scene takes place when Indio is remembering/fantasizing/reliving his rape of the Colonel's sister and his killing of her husband so it makes perfect dream-like, surreal logic that the reality of bullet holes doesn't occur in his hallucinatory flashbacks. Elsewhere Eastwood is called Manco by the sheriff paying off the Colonel for a bounty killing. I believe that when the dubbing script was translated from Italian to English, the slang word "Manco," meaning left handed was kept in instead of being translated into English as "Lefty." In the Italian language version, Eastwood's name would be understood as Lefty.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was the follow up to A Fistful of Dollars. As with the other Sergio Leone spaghetti westerns, the elements of a great picture are there. The music ,done by Ennio Morricone, is exceptional. The cinematography is gritty and dirty. The plot and character development are the only loose points that could have made this movie truly great. Do no get me wrong, I love this movie. I do not like it as much as The Good, The Bad and the Ugly, A Fistful of Dollars, or Once Upon a Time in the West. The plot revolves around an outlaw named Indio and the 2 bounty hunters (Clint Eastwood's - The Man with No Name and Lee Van Cleef's Col. Mortimer) determined to get him. It is a revenge/greed motivated plot. Gian Maria Volonte plays the role of insane, paranoid and evil Indio to perfection. By far the best aspect of the movie is the soundtrack. The title track and the pocket watch theme are two of Morricone's best. My favorite scene of the movie would have to be the duel at the end. Classic. If you like spaghetti westerns, you should not miss this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>For a Few Dollars More...The Journey Has Not Yet Ceased</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Once again, Clint, you haven't let me down. For a Few Dollars More is a triumphant second installment to Sergio Leone's infamous, and by infamous I mean that in a great way, trilogy. This film proves to be just as entertaining as A Fistful of Dollars and yet For a Few Dollars More is a better film. There is plenty of gunfighting in this film and nobody can't be entertained by the wild showdowns that two partnered bounty hunters face on their journey to capture a lethal bandit named Indio. Once again, no words can describe how inspiring this film is. Unfortunately, I was only able to watch A Fistful of Dollars once, but now I am free to watch For a Few Dollars More over and over again. Clint Eastwood's portrayal as the Man with No Name proves to be superb and inspiring. A true western classic that no western fan, especially a Clint Eastwood one, should miss. I wouldn't have missed this film for the world and I am looking forward to watching the conclusion of Eastwood and Leone's infamous trilogy; The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly, which I know will the most impressive of the three. Eastwood and Leone haven't let me down and they never will. Perhaps Eastwood's performance in westerns may still prove superb even without the assistance of Italian director Sergio Leone. But the two of them side by side help them film Eastwood's most classic westerns and above all, his most classic films of his career. Bravo, Eastwood. Bravo.</fullReview>

Let's face it, we're not dealing with reality here, and this movie might as well be classified as science fiction (spoiler begin) what with the leads shooting from the hip in order to gently toss hats a football field away without damaging them at all (spoiler end). But what makes the movie so worthwhile is the great black comedy throughout the film.

		<fullReview>This film is mad, tongue in cheek fun that borders on "Blue Velvet" style depravity when it's not reveling in its exaggerations of the genre. The villain Indio, who has to smoke a cigarette lit by someone else after he kills someone because he's so aroused by death that he can't function properly is what first made me love the actor Gian Maria Volonte. Despicable and unclean, you bet! The obligatory showdown/bonding scene between Eastwood and Van Cleef is the best of its type ever filmed. This, of all the Leone westerns, is just the most out and out fun. It's mad, evil fun. The score is exceptional even for Morricone, the direction, editing, writing, acting...everyone's at the top of their game. It features Klaus Kinski's best performance in a western, even topping "The Great Silence," even though he only figures in two scenes. Lee Van Cleef's line: "Why should a man who carries a gun allow himself to be insulted?" perfectly conveys the warped logic of this brilliant joy-ride through the world of European comic books from hell with pictures that move.</fullReview>

It is essentially an enhanced blueprint for the third film, but within that is an excellent film in its own right. Clint and Lee Van Cleef are fantastic as they play off each other whilst trying to track down notorious bandit El Indio and dont trust each other as far they could toss each other. There are excellent action set pieces which keeps the dialogue and story flowing nicely in the just over two hour running period. Highly recommended, so try For A Fistful of Dollars and The good the bad and the ugly too.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hardly a sentimental note to the whole film. About a criminal "Indio" and two bounty hunters who pursue him. One is revealed to have a very personal interest in killing this particular criminal (i.e. revenge).There is very little sentimentality in this; however this does not detract from it being a very very entertaining and fun. In my opinion it is the best of the Sergio Leone films ("The Good, The Bad and the Ugly" grates a little on re-viewing; "A fistful of dollars" is too claustrophobic (script-wise) and predictable; "A few dollars more" has more scope, and a very mean attitude to boot). Unlike many other westerns that are highly rated on IMDB (aside from "Once Upon a Time in the West" which is also brilliant), this film is virtually purely focussed on the actions and inter-play of 3 intelligent and violent men; No romance, virtually no sentimentality, and great entertainment. Great Western. 9/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film has to be the best Western ever made. The hard, often brutal lifestyle of the those who lived and worked in the days of the 'Wild West' is brilliantly portrayed in this film. It is ironic perhaps that this film was made by outsiders, ie non-Americans. Up until the 'spaghetti westerns', American made films of this period, tended to put too much gloss on the film, portraying like as hard work but at the same time, romantic and cosy. Sergio Leonne with a neutral and rational frame of mind, directs the film with the truth slant that this historic period deserves. The best of the 'Spaghetti' series, (The Good, the Bad and the Ugly) is rather too slowly paced, 'A Fistful of Dollars' will be as entertaining in 50 years time as it is now.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Improvement Over A Fistful of Dollars(1964)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Per Qualche Dollaro in Piu/For a Few Dollars More(1965) is much better than Sergio Leone's previous outing of A Fistful of Dollars(1965), and longer in duration. The first twenty minutes of For a Few Dollars More(1965) are well executed and one of the genre's best opening moments. The prison escape of Indio is done with great detail and precise filmmaking skill. Unlike the last film, there is more importantance on the characters of the movie. In the first dollar film, the gunfights were quick and short. In this movie everything slows down while a duel is about to commence.Although Clint Eastwood is acknowledged as the star of the movie, its Lee Van Cleef to which the story puts the main focus on. Lee Van Cleef plays a man whose out for revenge against Indio for a tragedy from the past. The duel during the film's climatic moment is both intense and suspenseful. In both For a Few Dollars More(1965) and Once Upon a Time in the West(1969), there is a tune from an object that represents something from the past. There are a few similarities between Lee Van Cleef's Colonel Mortimer and Franco Nero's Django. As in Once Upon a Time in the West(1969), the use of flashback occurs in the picture at a critical moment.Sergio Leone really had improved as a filmmaker when you view For a Few Dollars More(1965). Clint Eastwood shows a mysterious presence with his characterization of Monco. Ennio Morricone conducts a score of excellent quality with a haunting melody from the pocket watch. Klaus Kinski gives a stand out performance in basically a short role. Lee Van Cleef portrays a man of experience and maturity. The director's assistant directors were two guys who were later become big names during the 1970's named Fernando Di Leo and Tonino Valerii.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>FAFDM is a considerable improvement over the original Fistfull Of Dollars both for director Leone and rising star Eastwood.Brimmed with confidence from FOD Leone becomes slightly more stylish &amp; extrovert with his choice of directing. The violence and the dry humour is still there but the camera seems to pan out a whole lot more while the characters have more time to evolve into something more tangible than from FOD.We can also see from this film Leone's gradual development into producing more than just a shoot-out western. Very gradually each scene seems to have a rhythm &amp; mood all of its own that somehow doesn't seem right for a typical western. But Leone wants to move us away from this typical norm and educate us a little further so that our idea of a western is no longer imagined on the lines of High Noon or The Searchers. Leone is perhaps one of only a dozen decent directors who has the talent &amp; imagination to use the musical score to either enhance a scene or generate more pathos from it. Here he uses this technique only sparingly (the pocket watch duel being the prime example of this). And yet by the time he directed Once Upon A Time in the West, Morricone's haunting score is used more &amp; more frequently to further enhance &amp; emotionally charge the scene in question.FAFDM is quite good for what it is, but lacks a certain clarity &amp; direction, which isn't a complaint as such but perhaps Leone was trying for too many new ideas concurrently while living off a meagre budget. Although to be fair he soon repairs the damage in the third and best of the Dollar westerns where he is given the time &amp; money to live out his ideas to the full.As for Eastwood, well he still doesn't get round to saying very much which although doesn't hurt his kinetic performance it does make him a trifle wooden &amp; staid at times. Van Cleef gives a more pointed &amp; emotional performance as the elder bounty hunter of the two and perhaps takes the overall honours in the film. Overall For a Few Dollars More can be seen more as a development post for Leone's considerably crafted talents. It's also quite a good western but it might be an idea to give this a miss and move on to the superior Good, Bad &amp; the Ugly.***/*****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Man with No Name is joined by the Man in Black to hunt for a bounty of dollars.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"For A Few Dollars More" is the second of the trio of westerns made in Italy starring Clint Eastwood and produced by Sergio Leone. This film has Clint portraying a bounty hunter of the old school-no partners, all for me-who ends up joining forces with a mysterious man in black, Colonel Mortimer, played by Lee Van Cleef. The two of them are hunting a vicious Mexican outlaw, El Indio, played by Gian Maria Volonte. Each has a distinct reason for wanting to capture the bandit; Clint has $10,000 dollars bounty money in mind, while Van Cleef is simply wanting to extract a personal degree of revenge upon the bandit.In the course of the film, the two actually join the gang, help pull off a bank robbery, then spend the time plotting how to get the gang members bumped off and collect the bounties on a whole passel of bad guys. Ultimately, the final shootout does occur with Van Cleef and Volonte staring each other down and Eastwood awaiting the outcome.A rather violent view of the west, but then, the characters portrayed were rather violent men, interested in personal revenge or "For A Few Dollars More." A film favorite for those fans of Clint Eastwood, and a 9/10 on my personal scale.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Arguably the "best" of the Dollars Trilogy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having taken his cue from High Noon, Leone fashioned a true revisionism of the western genre while at the same time establishing a sort of standard in the process as displayed in Fistful of Dollars. Most viewers rate The Good the Bad and the Ugly as the superior of the "Dollars Trilogy," but I think a keen eye might spot For a Few Dollars More as the more compactly entertaining and indeed, more fully realized of the trio. Morricone's haunting score (as recognised in the pocket watch's melody) and Leone's attention to an evocative mise-en-scene combine together with a plot that moves the viewer from title to end with (dark)humor, tension and finally beauty. A ballet of sorts. And did I mention that Lee and Clint are completely badass?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The second in the 'dollars' trilogy is by far a better movie than 'A Fistful of Dollars' The story about two bounty killers forming a partnership to catch a bandit may sound run of the mill but the performances of the actors and the direction as well as the music make this film a superb cinematic experience. The film involves one of the bounty killers (Eastwood) infiltrating the band of desperadoes in order to get their hands on the bounty on their heads while the other bounty killer (Van Cleef) follows his every move just in case he decides to leave him out of there 'deal'. What follows is a series of bank holdups, jailbreaks and the film climaxes with a stand off between the bounty killers and the evil bandit Indio. Two scenes to watch out for are the match striking scene with the hunchback and when the Bounty killers first meet face to face. This film is a must see for all Western fans.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Watching 'For a Few Dollars More (1965)' is a bit like experiencing vertigo, the camera zooming in and pulling back at the same time. Sergio Leone's explosive Spaghetti Western debut 'A Fistful of Dollars (1964)' was produced on a shoestring budget, and, though the financial restraints are easily noticeable in the final cut, the film has such a unique visual style that it didn't really matter. For his follow-up, Leone had a considerably-larger budget with which to toil, and the result is a more coherent and assured editing style, the work of consummate professional. However, at the same time, this creative progression has a simultaneous detrimental effect. Leone, in attempting to craft a (slightly) more conventional picture, was now less inclined to indulge in the unashamedly erratic editing ? such as instant cuts from vast landscapes to sweat-soaked eyes ? that had made his previous film so utterly unique. Nevertheless, great film-making is about finding that ideal balance, and it's reassuring to note that the director did eventually strike it with his next picture, 'The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (1966).'In a decade when the Western was beginning to fall out of favour, many Italian directors decided to attempt their own interpretations of the genre, none more successfully than Sergio Leone. These "Spaghetti Westerns" dispensed with all respectability that the genre had once possessed, saturating the cinema screen with sweat, blood and smoke. His films are not particularly intellectual, but generations of audiences have delighted in the director's sheer enthusiasm for providing entertainment, and his "Dollars" trilogy is now regarded as a classic. 'For a Few Dollars More' was produced second in the loose trilogy, but, chronologically, its storyline is the last to take place. Clint Eastwood returned from his previous star-making performance as the enigmatic "Man With No Name" {though he does, in fact, go by the title Monco}, and Gian Maria Volont? is deliciously-evil as the ultimate bad guy, El Indio. Though I had fully expected Lee Van Cleef to be also playing a villain, Douglas Mortimer, a respected colonel-turned-bounty hunter, turned out to be a highly-reputable figure, and his performance is marked by a subtle humour that contrasts well with Eastwood's "straight man."The film opens with an ominous intertitle: "where life had no value, death, sometimes, had its price. That is why the bounty killers appeared." These bounty-hunters turn out to be the film's heroes, and we can only watch in awe as Manco and Mortimer expertly go about their daily profession, tracking down wanted fugitives, swiftly murdering them (typically after offering an opportunity to defend themselves) and claiming the hefty reward. Beyond their grizzled exterior, each man has a very definite reason for their chosen line of work: Monco wishes to amass enough money to retire somewhere quiet, and Mortimer is out to avenge the rape and death of his sister. But what happens when the two professional killers set their sights on the same target, perhaps the most lucrative prize of all? Will they decide to cooperate, or will they end up shooting each other in the back? There is a wonderful sequence where the two bounty-hunters match wits, progressively humiliating each other in a bizarre ritual that involves shooting the other man's hat. Also watch out for Klaus Kinski, in that "psycho" mode that only he could play to perfection.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The simplicity is what made this film a classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"For a few dollars more" is definitely one of the greatest westerns made; along side Leone's classic "The Good, the Bad, and The Ugly".Its dirty, violent yet simple story line is what made this film a classic. A tale of two gunslingers on the hunt for a ruthless bandit amongst the frontier. Its chilling music scores and fight scenes definitely influenced the movie makers of today, and completes the "the man with no name" trilogy.The mixture of Ennio Morricones music scores and Leoni's brilliant direction and characters is what makes his spaghetti westerns truly remarkable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as tense nor as clever as Fistful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Eastwood for me is wooden and surpassed in acting quality of Van Cleef - in fact I think the film would have been better if only one bounty hunter took on El Indio - i.e Eastwood isn't needed. The film is slicker - more money was obviously poured into this production - than Fistful. But in that film Eastwood is clever, the plot and twists are satisfying and the bad guys' characters are well developed but just as nasty. Still, it's a fun film and the gun fights are exciting. I have yet to see The Good, The Bad and The Ugly and cannot wait until I do. If it contains the intelligent plot of Fistful with the beauty and intense nature of Once Upon A Time in the West, then it'll be a winner in my book. If, however, it is solely about gun fights and dilutes the main characters' impact by having too many of them as in A Few Dollars, then I'd likely give it the same mark - 7/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After leaving commercials and the dull portrayal of Rowdie Yates, Eastwood finally got into something that I still enjoy watching - spaghetti westerns. Often corny and poorly acted I nevertheless sat thoroughly entranced as this seemingly heartless gunslinger hammered his way through a troop of vulgar, totally Satanic bandits who were intent on heaping as much destruction on the world as they were able to before their sorry lives burned out or stopped at the end of a smoking barrel. Which was the case here, of course; the point of the entire picture in fact. Van Cleef as Colonel Mortimer turned in one of his better performances as the revengeful reaper. Fortunately, in many cases anyway, this evil looking character actor went on to starring in many pasta movies of his own.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Great Western Movie of Sergio Leone, Clint Eastwood and Lee Van Cleef</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Monco (Clint Eastwood) is a bounty killer chasing El Indio (Gian Maria Volonté) and his gang. During his hunting, he meets Col. Douglas Mortimer (Lee Van Cleef), another bounty killer, and they decide to make a partnership, chase the bad guys together and split the reward. During their enterprise, there will be lots of bullets and funny situations. In the end, one of the bounty hunters shows the real intention of his hunting. This is another great western movie from Sergio Leone, with Clint Eastwood and Lee Van Cleef, and soundtrack of Enio Morricone. The fans of this genre of film will have a great entertainment. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): "Por Uns Dólares a Mais" ("For a Few More Dolars")</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Top 250: 121For A Few Dollars More is the 'sequel' to Fistful of Dollars. This time, Clint teams up with Lee Van Cleef to take down some bandits and get rich. It's a simple story, but it works. Unfortunately, it doesn't all work. I'm sure it saved a lot of money, but you can't cast the same guy to play the same role in an "unrelated" movie. (I'm talking about the bad guy). After the end of Fistful, I spent the first half of this movie trying to figure out what the film's relations are. It's too confusing, especially when the characters are so similar.The next problem are the other characters. In Fistful, it was Clint versus the town, alone with only his wits and his gun. In Halo 2, I mean Few Dollars More, we have two badasses to root for. Unfortunately, in my opinion this lessens both of their likability, especially since it seems there's less shooting in this than Fistful, but that comes later. Both characters are well acted though, and Van Cleef's revolver is a monster. Also, the 'psychopathic' Indio isn't that crazy compared to other movie villains, and he only starts to show his craziness halfway through the film. Again, I complain about his casting choice and lack of effort to differentiate him from Fistful's Rojo.Lastly, the film's pacing is not good and it runs too long. Whereas Fistful starts with a tense stand off and maintained an active pace, Few Dollars More starts off far too slow and picks up too late. Once the robbery happened, I was engaged for the rest of the film, but it took too long to get there for a spaghetti western. The film, 2 hours 10 minutes long, could've had 10-15 minutes cut and still told the same story with the same amount of action.Few Dollars More is still a fun western, with good leads and a strong second half. But it can't match up to it's predecessor, a more concentrated and enjoyable movie. 7.2/10</fullReview>

And the plot and characters are cool, with the train prophet and the bullet hat dance. It is nice to see Eastwood and Leone together again, with Lee Van Cleef in tow. This is a clear improvement over "Fistful of Dollars", in my opinion, and I think Lee VanCleef helps. He is underestimated.

The movie also gives some of the characters motivations, which was absent in the earlier flick, through incorporating flashback sequences in the storyline.The use of Ennio Morricone's musical score is also used as a narrative tool.With far better production values Sergio Leone's movie is a real treat for western fans</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well i know that most of the people say "The Dollars Trilogy" but my question is: it's really a trilogy? Well i really don't think that because you can watch the three films whit out an specific order and you can understand very well the films. It's similar of that "trilogy" of Wong Kar Wai with 2046 and In the mood for love. Of course if you like this film you MUST watch the other two and well better you can watch all of the Sergio Leone's films.About the film: the plot is simple, two men tries to kill the same victim for money so now they are together against the enemy.The plot is simple but Leone put his talent to make this simple plot into a very very good film because you never get bored or something. Clint Eastwood......well he is just a legend and this films are maybe his bests.Well also the other day i watch a TV program and the guys in the TV said that nobody can do what Blondie and Tuco did in The good.... yes the part when Blondie save Tuco from the rope but i think: Man it's CLINT EASTWOOD he can do anything.Also and finally for all the Tarantino's fans, well he loves this films so what are you waiting.</fullReview>

Once again, there are truly brilliant performances from both Clint Eastwood and Lee Van Cleef and the narrative, although not being completely conventional for a western is still amazing. however, the main reason that I fell in love with this film is because of the soundtrack, Ennio Morricone is brilliant with a perfect mixture of orchestral score an on-screen music sound that just give the film the perfect atmosphere, and bring it all together to produce the final product, a masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The stereotypical Western classic that is tops!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stereotypical is NOT bad. Not in my opinion anyways. Stereotypical simply means that the film follows the familiar pattern and when you're making a film following a certain genre, this is not a bad thing. Western's should for the most part try and fit into the tried and true mold and For A Few Dollars More does that exactly. You've got the dusty Western town, the villains, the bounties, and most important the bounty hunters. One thing that absolutely makes For A Few Dollars More stand out is the incredible chemistry and pairing of the stars Lee Van Cleef and Clint Eastwood. The two of them teamed up against each other later in The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly, but this time they team up together or try. I admit that I didn't find For A Few Dollars More quite as well filmed or action packed as Fistful of Dollars but it still lives up to it's classic reputation.Clint Eastwood returns in his Western role of The Stranger only this time we know a little more about him. Eastwood is a bounty hunter who is desperate to become rich by tracking down some of the bigger bounties out there. Eastwood is definitely not as light hearted as he was previously in Fistful of Dollars and instead plays the straight man to Van Cleef's rather humorous dialog. He's still quick with his wit and faster with his guns and plays his usual role flawlessly. Lee Van Cleef plays fellow bounty hunter Douglas Mortimer. Van Cleef is terrific, has some great dialog and easily goes toe to toe and holds his own against Eastwood as well he should being the veteran of the two. Their chemistry together is unmistakable and the film plays out almost like an 80's buddy cop film but set in the old west and from the sixties. The two are reluctant partners and at the same time scrambling for the same riches. However as the story unfolds we discover that Van Cleef's character has some bigger ulterior motives to tracking the villain. The villain is played by Gian Maria Volont?, Indio a man who is freed from Prison and returns to his large gang of men to cause havoc and destruction wherever they go which means big dollars for The Bounty Hunters. Volont? is fairly typical as the Western villain but again sometimes a stereotype can be good for a tried and true genre and Volont? does quite well.Director Sergio Leone continues to prove that he has a great deal of talent telling a story packed with action. You never once find yourself bored in a Leone western that I have seen as of yet and they always feel ahead of their time in their style and story on a minute budget. I would recommend seeing Fistful of Dollars first because I do think it was slightly superior to this in it's witty script and fast paced action and although For A Few Dollars More has that as well it's just not quite as good but very close don't get me wrong!! However it does have one thing that you can't miss out on and that is the infamous Lee Van Cleef who is just fantastic especially when paired with Eastwood. A must see for fans of the Western Genre or Eastwood. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Most Entertaining Spaghetti Western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Among Leone/Eastwood western trilogy, I consider this film to be the best. A Fistful of Dollars is a low budget, silly production with many script holes; The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly is the most ambitious one, but it drags too long and doesn't know how to end after its inventive showdown.For a Few Dollars More has an interesting background, I think the bounty hunter characters in the fading West are depicted on the screen for the first time. Clint, as the man with no name, maintains his cool and easy image from his previous work; Lee Van Cleef, who usually plays supporting villains in Westerns, finally had a big chance to play a leading role and is very effective; Gian Maria Volonte, as Clint's opponent again, is passable; Klaus Kinski, still unknown at the time, is most impressive as a hunchback gunslinger who is insulted by Cleef twice and get himself killed.However, this film has one obvious fault: When Clint first comes to El Paso, the street is crowded with people, but when the bandits are about to rob its bank, there's no one else on the street. Has everybody gone to take a nap after lunch?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as good as The Good, The Bad and The Ugly but better than A Fistful of Dollars</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just for the record I happen to love all three films. For a Few Dollard More is an amazing film though perhaps not as influential as The Good, The Bad and The Ugly. There is one improvement over that film though, and that is the writing of Clint Eastwood's character, more developed and more compelling. A Fistful of Dollars is also great because of everything that makes TGTBATU and FAFDM so good, but I do consider the other two more influential on the genre and also Akira Kurosawa's Yojimbo, which used the film as its inspiration, to be the superior film. Back to A Few Dollars More, the stylised visuals are stunning to look at, the scenery is the very definition of epic and the cinematography sweeps. Ennio Morricone's score is both elegiac and operatic in tone and the story of greed and revenge that focuses mainly on the pursuit of bandit Indio draws you right in and never lets go. The dialogue is peppered with grit and dark humour, which is well-balanced with neither over-powering the other, while Leone's direction is superb. Clint Eastwood plays his more developed character with immense charisma, Lee Van Cleef is suitably vengeful and again Gian Maria Volonte snarls convincingly. Overall, a wonderful film. 10/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From director Sergio Leone, this is the second of the "spaghetti" western trilogy to have The Man With No Name and the man who became an international superstar playing him. Basically Col. Douglas Mortimer (Lee Van Cleef) is a bounty hunter always on the look out for wanted posters of the latest threatening people in town. The stranger, called by someone Monco (Clint Eastwood) is his competition in the same game, and when they first meet there is quite a big disagreement and they try to unnerve each other. But they eventually have a chat, and decide to partner up to get the most wanted and highest rewarding, dead or alive, criminal of the town, El Indio (Gian Maria Volonté). They both have different reasons for wanting to get Indio, the stranger is in it for the money, and Mortimer driven by revenge for the death of his friend. After a lot of chatting, it does eventually come to the three-way shoot out, and when Indio has been defeated, I can't remember who by, the stranger decides that Mortimer should get all the glory, and he rides away. Also starring Joseph Egger as Old Prophet, Rosemary Dexter as Mortimer's Sister; Aguire, the Wrath of God's Klaus Kinski as Wild the Hunchback, Mara Krupp as Mary the Innkeeper, Mario Brega as Nino and Benito Stefanelli as Luke. Eastwood plays the poncho wearing, not very talkative and very cool stranger very well, especially being the only one speaking in sync, and there is enough gun play to entertain you, and great theme music by Ennio Morricone, it is a little longer, but a great classic western sequel. Clint Eastwood was number 18 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, and he was number 61 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons. Very good!</fullReview>

There are a few too many unneccesary scene's including the constant flashbacks by the bad guy, but the action scene's were good, it was all well directed, and the score was solid as well.

		<shortDescription>One of the great sequels.(possible spoiler)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Holding the centre between the compressed hysteria of A FISTFUL OF DOLLARS and the epic baroque of THE GOOD THE BAD AND THE UGLY, FOR A FEW DOLLARS MORE is a muted, slow-burning puzzle. Don't get me wrong, it's still full of funny and madness, but there are few explosions of ecstatic violence, the rites here are most definitely those of death, a death which infects the whole land, as visualised in the hilarious, absurd opening scene, a fixed long shot of a lonely rider who is arbitrarily picked off. Life has no value in these parts. If FISTFUL was early Verdi, than this is Wagner, an astonishingly free consolidation and elaboration of themes, intricately worked out, a fusion of visual and musical leitmotifs, true music drama. If Peckinpah is balletic, than this is a suffocating tableau vivant (or mourant?).All the compelling contradictions and paradoxes of the Leone aesthetic are in full fruitful disjunction here. The tension between seriousness and mockery - on the one hand the film is given epic dignity and mythic scope. The haphazard nature of the sets might seem 'artificial', but so were settlements in those days, Leone giving the lie to manifest destiny. There is a quest, in keeping with the great Westerns (eg THE SEARCHERS), linked to family.On the other hand, the film is laced with parodic camp. Morricone's magnificent score is at its most unleashed here, comically intrusive at moments of apparent solemnity. The gleeful homoeroticism (eg Indio lighting his cigar from Monco's; the uproarious hat shootout, the hat being a traditional emblem of male sexual power; Mortimer's yummy fetishistic leather boots), undermines the macho posturing, in Monco's case again linked to sexual abstinence. The film is full of bizarre one-liners, double-takes that seem addressed to the audience, berserk compositions, angles and editing, vaudevillian bits of business that constantly distract us from the issue at hand. And what that issue might be is obfuscated until the closing ritual, a dress rehearsal for UGLY's astonishing finale, so that it is easy to be distracted. The motif of the tinkling watches is, typically, as silly as it is evocative.Further, there is a great emphasis on the theatrical, which wrenches the viewer out of the action at hand, into a consideration of role playing. Mortimer is pure theatre, as he makes his entrance from the stopped train, the proscenium arch of the carriage, or has his own musician scoring his actions in the first saloon scene.Nothing fits in MORE This is Leone's most dreamlike film, as his lonely ciphers travel back and forth over a vast, empty terrain, like dream figures. Even sites of potential life - saloons, trains, brothels etc. - are eerily underpopulated, and if the settlements they arrive in aren't ghost towns, they are when they leave. The film is full of circular dream logic, random, elliptical - the final exit of Monco carting the dead is brilliantly surrealist.And yet, the film is vividly tangible in a way traditional Westerns never were (except maybe Mann, Leone's most obvious influence): you can feel the creaking wood, the interior decor, the sun-parched land - Leone's style, describing a world of Darwinian viciousness yet geometrically beautiful, deliberately intrudes on people and things, as if the camera is about to touch them.Once again, these contradictions converge on Clint's character. He is, as in FISTFUL, seemingly an abstract figure, an inviolable Grim Reaper shearing his way through Biblically arid lands. Even as the film progresses, and relationships are forged, Monco remains an enigma. Mortimer is linked to family, Indio to his friends - both relations are characterised by rupture and betrayal, motivating their actions. Monco has none, not even the tantalising intimation given in FISTFUL.But, in contrast to his abstraction or distance, his very human vulnerability is revealed in a ritualistic beating, as in the first film; his beautiful body pulverised, on public display. His gaze is less powerful in this film, less organising, as you might expect when he is on the sidelines to a quest he doesn't understand. His expert gunplay is less inexplicable, 'supernatural'.He also seems the most human of the three (that Leone triangle again); he is no longer the mysterious stranger in the series - this is Mortimer, whose unaccountable activities, aquiline face and morose hauteur are as unlikely to endear as Indio's strange, mentally befuddling, neurosis. That these latter are linked through family, past and death, against Monco is significant, but there might also be another opposition between 'old man' Mortimer, with his traditional, if more TERMINATOR-like, revenge quest, and 'boy' Monco's pointless capitalism, the Old West and the New (although Mortimer is linked to trains, which are shown, in a wonderful scene with a stubborn old landowner, to be the phantom power indifferent to these boy-boy rituals - soon to be dramatised in Leone's masterpiece). This is taken to a surprising conclusion in the mighty final part of the trilogy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good, but not great.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film has some great characters and a great idea, but there is so much going against it. First bad thing about the film: the editing. I can't name every single example, but there is one scene in particular in the beginning (the saloon scene, if you've scene it) where Clint gets off his horse and is crouched, and the next shot he is upright. Then, during a fistfight, he throws punches three feet away from his victim. Second bad thing about the film: unrealistic violence. First of all, nobody bleeds. One Mexican bleeds at the end, that's about it. Secondly, I know Mortimer and TMWNN are the best shots in the west, but in one scene Mortimer blindly shoots at someone and barely clips him in the neck, as a warning shot. I thought it was cool when I saw it, but in retrospect, it's cheesy. Third bad thing about this film: the dialog. It's just too unrealistic. It's entertaining, however, in a campy way. For example, listen to Clint Eastwood's quote: "Tell me, isn't sheriff supposed to be courageous, loyal and, above all, honest?" It made me smile, but cringe at the same time. The rest of the film is great. There is great Western-looking sets. The characters are great and interesting, and the plot has many twists to it, so it keeps you intrigued.Overall, I give this film a B.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best of the Spaghetti Westerns.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The second film from Sergio Leone in his "Nameless Man" trilogy is probably my favorite of the three. Clint Eastwood returns as the mysterious drifter who is not exactly the nicest man on Earth. He is a bounty hunter after an escaped fugitive (Gian Maria Volonte, playing a different character from "A Fistful of Dollars") who has a devious plan to steal a bank safe. His band of outlaws are heartless and dangerous. Also along for the ride is bounty hunter supreme Lee Van Cleef who is after Volonte for reasons that are not only economic. In the end can Eastwood and Van Cleef co-exist or will they become enemies on the trail of Volonte? "For a Few Dollars More" is a little deeper than its predecessor and definitely better made. The plot is more believable and Eastwood gets a little more depth to his under-developed character here. Really no relation to the story in "A Fistful of Dollars" but still full of similarities. 4 stars out of 5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lee Van Cleef steals the show...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"For a Few Dollars More" is the middle installment of Sergio Leone's classic Western trilogy, and, fittingly enough, it represents a transitional period for the director. It's a bridge between his more action-oriented work ("A Fistful of Dollars") and his later, more arty efforts ("The Good, the Bad and the Ugly" and especially "Once Upon a Time in the West").Some people would say that "For a Few Dollars More" is therefore the perfect Leone film, because it's an elegant balance of his two styles. Others might say it's one of his weaker films because it's neither here nor there - neither art, nor action.I'm not quite sure where I stand on this particular issue. I enjoy this film a lot, and recognize that it's a more polished piece of work than "A Fistful of Dollars." But sometimes I get a little bored watching "For a Few Dollars More," and that simply doesn't happen to me during its predecessor or its sequel.I do know for certain that I love Lee Van Cleef in this movie. He's deadly, witty, stylishly dressed and simply too cool for words. I also love his funky array of guns, and his motivation is suitably compelling.By contrast, Clint Eastwood's Man with no Name is actually a little dull. (Eastwood is, by the way, called Monco here. I tend to think that this is his real name, rather than the obvious nicknames "Joe" and "Blondie" we get in the other films.) But even though he's not the best part of the film, his interplay with Van Cleef is fun to watch.Though it sounds like I've been groaning about this film, I really do enjoy it. I just have somewhat mixed feelings about the pacing and its place in the overall trilogy. But, whenever I happen to get a little down on "For a Few Dollars More," I think of that haunting pocket-watch theme and remember that, yeah, it's pretty damn cool - pretty much just as cool as everything else Leone directed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spaghetti Westerns!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While there are many things to dislike about spaghetti westerns the film making is not one of them. Anyone who wants to go on to make their own films would do well to watch any of Sergio Leone. His use of close ups, the sky and just about everything is like a class in film-making! As a Spaghetti Western this is a good one! Who can argue with the teaming of Lee Van Cleef and Clint Eastwood. Although Eastwood is referred to as the man with no name, he has a name in this film, Monco. This film, while not the best of the Spaghetti Westerns is no slouch either. Again if you watch it for no other reason then the work of Sergio Leone or the eerie score by Ennio Morricone you can't lose. If you love westerns this film is likewise a must. Best viewed after watching "A Fist Full of Dollars", but not a must.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>English: For A Few Dollars More. Typical Clint Eastwood western. This is the middle version of the trilogy. The first is a Fistful of Dollars and the third is The Good, the Bad and the Ugly. On par with the FoD, but not quite as good as GBU. I consider GBU to be the best western ever made.This version ended up being a very good buddy movie. Not a lot of buddy, but the idea that Eastwood and Van Cleef were joined at the hip was an essential part of the plot. They actually worked well together despite never really trusting each other. Don't ask questions like how do they go to the bathroom, take a bath, brush their teeth or any other minor hygienic detail and you will be fine. Just settle in for some good old killing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The second in the trilogy doesn't get enough credit</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having seen all of the "Man with No Name" trilogy I have to say i enjoyed "For a Few Dollars More" the most. Even though everyone says the movie is great. They never give it enough credit when compared to other Leone westerns. For me "Dollars More" is the perfect middle between the trilogy. GBU is the masterpiece, but you can't watch a masterpiece movie as much as B movies. "Dollars More" is better for constant viewing. Many people felt the plot wasn't as good a "Fistful", (and it wasn't), but I had already seen Yojimbo, which "Fistful" gets it's plot from. So everything done in "Fistful" was something I'd already seen. Plus Fistful has it's slow parts....sorry it just does. Also, I like the score in "Dollars More" better. Once again it's the perfect middle ground between "Fistful" and GBU. The GBU score has been overused and "Fistful"'s score doesn't give as much emphasis like "Dollars More" gives. Especially, the two showdowns with Indio. The music couldn't be done any better. The bells melody mixed with the other elements was perfect for both scenes. Given Indio a melody played by the cathedral organ then using the same melody for Lee Van Clef but with a trumpet show the contrast between good and evil that most non-music people would miss. So I'll sum it like this:A Fistful of Dollars- hardcore western fans For a Few Dollars More- action fans The Good, The Bad , &amp; the Ugly- Masterpiece western fans</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Great flick...from beginning to end. Tighter than The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly; Harder and more sophisticated than A Fistful Of Dollars: This is easily the best of the trilogy and is my favorite Western ever. Granted that I haven't seen much outside of these, other Clint Eastwoods, The Wild Bunch, John Wayne flicks, and a few others, but not much could top this one for me. Firstly, as always, the music from Ennio Morricone is beautiful. The action and cinematography are top-notch as always. The character of Col. Mortimer gives the movie more depth than Fistful, and the villain El Indio is top-notch. The final shootout is one of the best in the genre and the final shootout with the chimes makes me shiver. Then, to cap all things off, Clint Eastwood delivers one of the funniest endings ever when he's counting his booty. ***** out've *****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've always thought it helps to be a Sergio Leone fan if you want to really enjoy his movies. I mean, here I am riding in a car with a professor, educated at Columbia and Harvard, from a distinguished family, brother-in-law to a former Secretary of State, and he's carrying on about the talent of Sergio Leone, making me feel like a proletarian dummy, the kind of guy who says things like, "I don't know anything about art but I know what I like." I thought "A Fistful of Dollars" was ludicrous, "Once Upon a Time in the West" mistakenly made a bad man out of President Henry Fonda, and "Once Upon a Time in America" dealt with Jewish gangsters who looked mighty Italian to me.There's something else too. Unlike American-made Westerns, the spaghetti Westerns, drenched in atmosphere though they may be, are devoid of any history or any back story at all. Look at "Shane." Cattlemen versus squatters. Or "The Wild Bunch." Day of the outlaw draws to a close. But there's none of this in Leone's Westerns. The town is in the middle of nowhere. Nobody has a wife and kids to worry about. There has been no Civil War. There's nothing but moral nihilism. It's completely abstract in all of its elements.I wasn't able to get all the way through "For A Few Dollars More" but, to tell the truth, it wasn't as painful as I'd expected. I nodded out, not because of the movie but because of the demands of my reticular activating system.The story was ritualized junk, to be sure, and the titles seem to have been done by a high school kid for a class in graphics, but -- I don't know -- in the opening scenes Lee Van Cleef's face in close up is the color of teak and has a fine sheen to it, as of a thin coat of lard. In these swarthy faces teeth seem to glow in the dark.Van Cleef is a cool bounty hunter and shoots bad guys for a living. Clint Eastwood is a bounty hunter too but of a different stripe. Where Van Cleef is dressed in an estimable suit and cape of black, riding a horse of the same color, like an undertaker, Eastwood is raggedy in his poncho. They both shoot and kill like lightning. And they're both after the same no-goodnik, Gian Maria Volonte.Volonte is Italian, not Mexican, and his voice is dubbed by an American, but that doesn't matter because everybody's voice was dubbed in later and, except for Eastwood, Van Cleef, and Kinski, all the actors seem to be Italian too. All the sounds are foleyed in -- the PTEW gun shots, the crunch of gravel beneath the silver-spurred black boot, the sharp clatter of horse hooves on wooden planks. Ennio Morricone, who could write good music, must have chuckled as he scored the whistling theme here.Anyway, I was sort of getting into it but finally felt myself nodding out and went to bed instead. I imagine Volonte wound up a corpse, among so many corpses, and that there was some sort of confrontation between the impeccable Van Cleef and the peccable Eastwood. If it's on again, I might watch it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Eastwood and Van Cleef give fine character performance in this stylish and stimulating, however not remarkable Italian Western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"For a Few Dollars More" is the second of three enormously successful Italian Westerns that Sergio Leone made with future superstar Clint Eastwood in the mid 1960s. The first was "A Fistful of Dollars", which though a hit and a good Western, was not original (it was later the subject of a successful lawsuit by Japanese filmmaker Akira Kurosawa who noticed it was very similar to his 1961 film "Yojimbo") and the third and best of the trilogy was "The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly", which has now reached icon status. The film in the middle? Well, it's the second-best. It's a little better than "A Fistful of Dollars", but is still just on the level of being good. It's a decent, entertaining matinée but how masterpiece like its successor.Eastwood returns again as a sneering, poncho-wearing gunfighter who has no name, now on the trail of a notorious bandit named El Indio (Gian Maria Volonté). While on his tracks, he teams up with another bounty hunter (Lee Van Cleef) whose reason for hunting Indio turns out to be more than the reward.Leone was a director who used the same cinematic styles and camera techniques over and over again. He used montages of close-ups, broad wide angles that remind you of scenes from "Lawrence of Arabia" (1962), very little dialogue. And you see all of that in "For a Few Dollars More." It's a very stylistic Western, but how does it fare on entertainment value? On the whole, I liked the movie. I wasn't bored, it kept moving, it didn't try to be anything more than what it was, and I enjoyed it. But on the other hand, it does pale in comparison to "The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly." But perhaps this is an unfair comparison, since very few films come even within range of being as good as the said Italian masterpiece.Although I didn't find it to be an incredible film-going experience, there was a lot to like. Eastwood and Van Cleef were well-cast in the roles of the two conniving bounty hunters and Gian Maria Volonté played another good villain. The movie also has a lot of action. It starts with a gunshot and ends with a gunshot and there is lot of gunfire in between. If you can't suspend disbelief or if you dislike movies that more or less glorify violence, you will not enjoy this movie, for Leone makes a very stylish portrayal with his gunfighters making clever remarks and performing fancy tricks as they gun down their opponents. The movie is also aided by a strong score by Ennio Morricone.Bottom line, like "A Fistful of Dollars", I thought it was a good Western, but not a great one. It passes the time exceptionally well, but it's not a movie that I find myself watching over and over again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best westerns</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Clint Eastwood and Sergio Leone tag-team again for the second episode in the "Dollars" series. Known as a "Spaghetti Western", director Sergio Leone repeats his successful dose of formulas in perhaps one of the best western movies of all time. Eastwood plays Manco, a young and restless bounty hunter searching for quarry that will pay his way to great fortunes. On the other hand, veteran actor Lee Van Cleef portrays Colonel Douglas Mortimer, a retired Army Colonel on a quest to vanquish an old nemesis known as Indio. Eastwood and Van Cleef pair up to take on Indio's lethal band of pilferers, thus claiming their heads for a bounty. However, the plot thickens when a bounty isn't the only prize, by nabbing these derrilicts of society. Both Eastwood and Van Cleef deliver crude and genuine performances. Along with another great score as music background, the team assembled for this picture proves gripping and breath-taking. A must see Western, matched only by its sequel and prequel.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Serigo Leone's second entry in his sensational Dollars trilogy may well be the best of the three and makes for a memorably atomspheric, exciting and superb western experience. Clint Eastwood is of course back as the dangerous, nameless bounty hunter who finds himself forming an uneasy alliance with the fellow bounty hunter and equally mysterious, Colonel Mortimer (Lee Van Cleef). Together, they set about trying to capture a gang of outlaws, led by the ruthless Indio. Whilst the original A Fistful of Dollars was a great and ground-breaking film, it did need a polished touch, which is what Leone has set about adding to this near-masterpiece from start to finish. The three leads are extremely impressive in roles they were born to play and Ennio Morricone's quirky, stirring score is again something else. The violence is notably ever-growing and there's a lot of it in this one but its softened by some great, scene-stealing tounge-in-cheek humor. Bring on The Good, The Bad and The Ugly.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Clint Eastwood is pretty much the king of westerns. And when the western is being directed by Sergio Leone, you know it good spaghetti-western entertainment. However, this one seemed a little repetitive and predictable. At times it seemed to repeat itself endlessly. Either talking or shooting, none of them moving the plot forward or getting any further with the movie. It just seemed to much like filler. The plot is OK, but seems too much like an excuse to put Clint and Lee Van Cleef in some scenes where they could show off their icy stares and their poker-faces. The acting is good enough for a western. The soundtrack is not as good as in "The good, the bad and the ugly", but almost. The action seemed a little too repetitive, and lacked the ingenuity of "The good, the bad and the ugly". Overall, a pretty good western, but just not as good as the next part of the trilogy(The good, the bad and the ugly). I haven't seen the first part, "A fistful of dollars" yet, but I'll see it as soon as I get a chance, so I can find out which part is the best. I recommend this movie to fans of spaghetti-westerns, Clint Eastwood and Sergio Leone. 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The second film in the Dollars Trilogy sees the Man with No Name become a Bounty Hunter and compete for the bounty of a notorious criminal with another talented and prepared hunter. The movie is a step up in scale from A Fistful of Dollars but a step down in coherence and pacing.The film's moments of comedy are what make it stand out. Whereas the first Leone movie was a very somber piece, For a Few Dollars More displays the West as being inhabited by quirky characters. Even Eastwood and Van Cleef's heroes aren't quite as serious as their majestic and iconic appearances would let on. The comedic elements however don't always come off very cleanly which is a bit of a shame.Stylistically the film remains consistent with the Dollars trilogy. However El Indio is not the most compelling antagonist and for this reason his part in the movie comes off rather uninteresting. Between Manco and Colonel Mortimer there's a bit of a void to be filled by a more interesting character and this begins to show in the film's pace. The film feels too long with not enough material to fill the running time. Even the catchy theme song begins to feel repetitive at times.However, Leone's distinctive style and I think especially Van Cleef's sympathetic performance are what make this movie worth watching, but personally I think it's the weakest film in the Dollars Trilogy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's a laugh but a good laugh</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is not your average movie comment.Most importantly first: I know that Klaus Kinski, who plays a tiny side role in this classic flick, said himself that he liked to take on roles which demand no high-profiled playing, but which were paid well.Kinski's attitude is in itself disillusioned and sarcastic.The soundtrack is somewhat naturally Italo-dominated and very heroificating the main actors, Clint and that other one, the so-called "Monk", which in fact saves the whole movie from being just another mainstream delusional product.Like "Django", this is your typical italo-"spaghetti western".But in "Django", there is a REAL story about someone the watcher CARES about, and really deeply.Attention, SPOILER: Of course I sympathize with the monk (I rather laugh about Clint), and of course I see the disturbedness of our plain and unchanging evil guy, only called "Ninjo". But when I look into the eyes of Ninjo, I see despair, I see repeated beatedness in his childhood, I see his own abusedness by others.I would be careful with such psychos, but I would NEVERTHELESS try to help him, psychically.Well, of COURSE, in the wild wild west, it would REALLY have been better if the real evil guys would have been shot fast. But that was VERY rarely the case. OK, all westerns show the cruelty of the wild west. But many westerns only show us ONE story in which at the end, the good ones prevail.Note that I wrote "good" without any quotation marks, before. That was intended. I believe personally in good and evil, as simple and dull as it may sound.But I don't believe that the good mostly vanquishes evil, I believe in the near exact contrary.In the real wild west, people like the ones that the monk and Clint are displaying, would have a lot smaller chance of survival. True, there were some few ones who shot really well.Anyway, this movie is only offering revenge in the form of the death of the other as a solution, it shows a lot of fictionally and individually worthless "evil" (NOW mark the quotation marks!) guys getting shot by two people who kill for money. Oh, how honorable. In this setting, the movie intends to make it believable that at least a few good ones where there among the bounty hunters? Or does this movie unphilosophically laugh upon itself? Surely, the audience laughs a lot. Some people might utter some lots of admiring and pseudo-professional super-admiring statements about this movie, saying it would have maybe been "underrated" for a long time until the early 2000s. The main comment on IMDb says this movie would be "hard" or "brutal", whoa, I laugh myself to death. This movie isn't showing any blood, nearly! This is a soap-opera, it's like caressing my beloved cat in comparison to "Silence of the lambs" or then even terrible, unethical movies like "Hostel" and "Saw", which I cannot watch, at all.I ate some really good spaghetti to my beloved monk and Kinski, and I was in fact very amused by all three of em, well, all four, including the actor playing Ninjo. That they allowed Kinski only one or two words is a scandal.When the camera is showing distanced settings directly on the landscape, when the music is swelling, I have my thoughts about existence, and about the unnecessary cruelty of mankind, and also about the nice moments, the love, the sharing, the happiness.Yea, surely there IS something behind this actual pseudo-western, there is a critical attitude, the one of Mister Sergio Leone who directed it, there IS his strong statement that counter-death was all they had back then when their very lives were threatened - did I say "threatened"? OK, so this movie takes bounty hunters whose lives they themselves put into danger in order to enrich themselves, and Leone surely does this fully on purpose, only to compare the bounty hunters' not super-high ethics to the even lower ones of others.While Leone surely doesn't say it would always have been like this, while I myself admire Leone for the other great stuff he shot (note the merely literal [?] similarity between "shooting" a film and actual gun-shooting...), I have to say to Mister Leone that this flick of his is rather funny than positively pathetic - being European, I know that most Americans use the word "pathetic" in a negative way, but this is their own language salad or abuse. "Pathos" derives from Greek and means the grandeur of a situation or of speech, for instance. Only the wannabee-western-like, in fact totally UN-western-like music is pathetic in this movie, the rest is tricking the audience into thoughts of their own as the "now they shoot them, then they them"-story progresses - the movie HAS got a good pace, though, and IS not only well-watchable, but a MEGA delight to the casual as well as the aficionado watcher.But to someone who demands more of movies, this is not a great gift.Clint's much later "Unforgiven" can be entitled a sequel of this movie, if you want. Some ugly evil men kill innocents, and then the revenge starts."Django" reaches the heigths of big westerns, I like it even more, because it always stays modest. And lovely. This Django character REALLY made me identify with him. Also the actor who here plays the monk had a similar effect on me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For a Few Dollars More (Italian: Per qualche dollaro in pi?) is a 1965 Italian spaghetti western film directed by Sergio Leone and starring Clint Eastwood, Lee Van Cleef and Gian Maria Volonté German actor Klaus Kinski also plays a supporting role as a secondary villain. The film was released in the United States in 1967 and is the second part of what is commonly known as the Dollars Trilogy.Summary: Eastwood (as the Man with No Name) and Van Cleef (as Colonel Douglas Mortimer and the "Man in Black") portray two bounty hunters in pursuit of "El Indio" (Gian Maria Volonté), one of the most wanted fugitives in the western territories, and his gang. Indio is a ruthless, intelligent man. He has a musical pocket watch that he plays before engaging in gun duels. "When the chimes finish, begin," he says. Flashbacks reveal that the watch originates from a young woman (Rosemary Dexter), who killed herself while being raped by Indio after he had found her with her lover (in Joe Millard's novelization of the film, the young man is her newly-wed husband) and killed him. The watch bears a photo of the woman and was presented as a gift by the young man before being killed. Colonel Mortimer (Cleef) illegally stops a train in Tucumcari, and soon after collects a bounty of $1,000 on Guy Calloway (José Terrón). Mortimer's gun slinging skill is displayed as he easily kills him from long distance. After collecting the bounty, he inquires about Red "Baby" Cavanagh (José Marco), who has a $2,000 bounty, and was last seen in White Rocks. Mortimer is told that Cavanagh has already been targeted by Eastwood's character, who is referred to as "Manco" (meaning one-armed in Spanish ? see below for an explanation). We see Manco ride into town and track down Cavanagh at a saloon playing five-card draw poker. Manco kills him and his men, and takes the bounty. Eventually, the two bounty hunters, after learning about each other from different sources, meet in El Paso and, after butting heads, decide to team up to take down Indio and his gang.Questions: What was so important about the bank in El Paso? Who was offered a membership? What was the membership to? Who recognizes the Colonel? Who is the Colonel? Where did the Colonel come from? Who was the Colonel's right hand man? What was Indio up to? Does anyone figure out what Indio was up to? My Thoughts: I like western films and I like Clint Eastwood films. However, this one was a waste of time! Clint Eastwoods talents were wasted in this movie. There was no theme to this picture. I lasted about ? hour before I loss interest. The plot was simple and it didn't take long to figure it out. Usually when you watch a Clint Eastwood, it has you guessing until the end. This one didn't! Because of the lack of interest and because there was no leading lady I give this movie 2 weasel stars and that was beginning nice.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sluggish Leone</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sergio Leone's second installment in his spaghetti-western trilogy with lead actor Clint Eastwood (following 1964's "A Fistful of Dollars" and in turn followed by 1966's "The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly"). Bounty hunter Clint spars with gunslinger Lee Van Cleef amidst a great many dirt-town and saloon shoot-outs. Sweaty atmospherics, some exciting sequences (including a terrific finish), but Leone's pacing is unbelievably dogged. Although the films in this canon have a tricky kind of symbolism which underline the finished product with a bracing, immediate quality that can be quite gripping for an audience, they are not deep-thinkers, and after the first hour it becomes blurry with noisy violence. *1/2 from ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Typical spaghetti-all music and nothing else</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a typical spaghetti Western, which means it has great music and sound effects, and nothing else going for it. The plot is somewhat better than most Eastwood westerns. Two bounty hunters team up to chase down a gang. And there is an interesting duel involving the chimes on a watch. There, all interest ends. Some characters are like comic book super heroes, but without the explanation of being super heroes. For example, Superman was from Krypton and had super powers because he was an alien. The super powers of the two major characters here makes no sense. For that matter, neither do their characters. We're supposed to accept their vicious behavior, but why? No explanation. I challenge anyone to watch a spaghetti western without the sound, using just subtitles, and I guarantee that person will be bored to death. Great music, lots of meaningless action, ridiculous story lines, poor characters, poor acting, and poor writing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>For A Few Dollars More-Forget the Money &amp; Run. *</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A young Clint Eastwood and the late Lee Van Cleef star in this typical spaghetti western.An alternate title may have been "Mutiny Among The Bounty Hunters."The film starts off with the exploits of Van Cleef and Eastwood as bounty hunters. They shoot their hearts off and along the way, they collect nice money while lodging bullets in the heads of their wanted outlaws.Their big task is to get a noted outlaw, who with a group of 15 others, is planning a major bank robbery. Turns out that one of the bounty hunters wants him for personal reasons as well.The film is often slow paced. It's entirely too violent for our tastes. The scene where our major bandit blows away a young mother and her 18 month old is not shown but you feel the emotion when the gun goes off and off.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>They don't come much worse than this one. A few interesting scenes but as usual with Leone this thing drags and drags. And his bad guys are so despicable and unclean they render themselves unwatchable. Do yourself a favor....Spoiler alert: and fast forward to the final scene, skip the rest of this turkey. It wasn't very popular in the 60's and doesnt translate at all now. BTW, Walmart sells the entire Leone series for $9.44 apiece, and for a reason. Help yourself. 1/10</fullReview>
