		<fullReview>A cute and smart rabbit Judy Hopps is so ambitious and intelligent.She wants to become a police officer. No bunnies ever before became police officers in the animal world of Zootopia because they are not strong enough. But Judy doesn't care what other people and animals think about her . She wants to overcome the prejudice and bigotry that a rabbit is small and weak animal and thus is not fit to become a police officer.She's determined to make her dream come true, but unfortunately for her,she faces problems. She caught a convicted Fox who has already committed a crime, and gave him the option that she can help him to avoid jail imprisonment if only he can definitely help her in finding the missing animals. As a result, the fox and the bunny become friends and because of the intelligence of the amazing Judy (the bunny) she cleverly tamed the sly fox and attracted him to do the good and to refrain from doing evil especially after he fell in love with this yummy bunny Judy.Zootopia is best of the best for the spectacular cinematography,impressive story,enchanting music and stunning acting.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Zootopia" is simply the best animated movie of the year 2016 because the animation was terrific,the acting was mesmerizing and the plot was impressively perfect.A female bunny Judy Hopps faces discrimination from other prejudiced and bigoted animals who made fun of her size and could not believe her strong determination to be a cop.since Judy is brainy and has a strong will to be a successful cop,she made a deal with a sly fox to get what she wants.When the genius and the yummy bunny Judy became a policewoman,she was so just and confident in dealing with other animals and soon she receives all the estimation from all the animals including the previously prejudiced animals who underestimated it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Indeed An Excellent Movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In a world populated by anthropomorphic mammals, Judy Hopps, a rabbit from rural Bunnyburrow, fulfills her dream of becoming the first rabbit officer in the police department of nearby city Zootopia. However, upon arrival, she is assigned parking duty by Chief Bogo, an African buffalo, who doubts her potential due to her being a rabbit and thus smaller than most of the large animals on the force. During one of her shifts, she meets Nick Wilde, a con artist fox.Hopps abandons her shift to arrest a thief, Duke Weaselton. She is reprimanded by Bogo and nearly fired until Mrs. Otterton, an otter, arrives pleading for help locating her missing husband ? one of many animals recently missing in Zootopia. To Bogo's dismay, Hopps volunteers and agrees to resign if she cannot solve the case within 48 hours. She sees Wilde in the last known photo of Otterton and tracks him down, coercing him into to assisting her with the investigation.After acquiring Mr. Otterton's license plate number, Hopps and Wilde track the vehicle to Mr. Big, an Arctic shrew crime boss. Mr. Big informs the pair that Otterton, his florist, had gone savage and attacked his chauffeur Manchas, a black jaguar. Hopps and Wilde locate Manchas, who mentions "night howlers" were responsible for attacking him before he goes savage and chases the pair out of his home. When Bogo and his reinforcements arrive, Manchas disappears. Bogo demands Hopps resign, but Wilde takes a stand, insisting they have 10 more hours to solve the case. As the pair leaves, Hopps learns from Wilde that he was bullied by prey animals as a pup and became a criminal, believing he would be stereotyped as one no matter what due to being a fox.Wilde realizes that the city's traffic camera system may have captured Manchas's disappearance, and the pair consult Assistant Mayor Bellwether, a sheep. They identify the captors as wolves, hence "night howlers". Hopps and Wilde locate the missing mammals (including Mr. Otterton) at Hillside Asylum. All are predators, and all have gone savage like Manchas. The two discover Mayor Lionheart consulting with a doctor about the predators' condition. The pair escape with the evidence and the police swarm the area, arresting Lionheart.Having developed a friendship with Wilde throughout the case, Hopps requests that he joins the Zootopia Police Department and become her partner, which Wilde happily considers. However, during a press conference, Hopps mentions that the savage animals are predators and argues they have gone back to their "natural state." Wilde is hurt and angrily walks out on her offer. Fear and discrimination against predators spreads across Zootopia, and a guilt-ridden Hopps resigns. During this time, pop singer Gazelle holds a peaceful protest and publicly asks for the harmonious Zootopia she loves to be restored.Back in Bunnyburrow, Hopps learns that "night howlers" are flowers that have a severe psychotropic effects on mammals. Hopps returns to Zootopia and reconciles with Wilde. They locate Weaselton and learn that he has been collecting night howlers for a secret laboratory. The pair discover the lab and find ram scientists creating a night howler serum, which has been injected into predators via dart guns. Hopps and Wilde race to the ZPD with the evidence, but the rams pursue them.Just short of the ZPD, the pair encounters Bellwether, who tries to take the evidence. Realizing Bellwether is the mastermind of a species-supremacist conspiracy, Hopps and Wilde try to flee, but Bellwether shoots a dart at Wilde and calls the ZPD for help. Wilde becomes savage and corners Hopps, but it turns out the pair were acting and had swapped out Bellwether's darts for blueberries. With Bellwether's confession recorded on Hopps's carrot pen, the two have enough evidence to unravel the conspiracy.Some months later, Hopps is reinstated into the ZPD. The savaged mammals are cured. Lionheart is cleared of all charges and is reinstated as mayor. Wilde joins the ZPD as the first fox officer and Judy's new partner. In the final scene, all of Zootopia enjoys a performance by Gazelle, who dances with four tigers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Film Of The Year, So Far.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the studio that brought you Tangled, Wreck-It Ralph, Frozen &amp; Big Hero 6, Zootopia surfaces as a highly original, incredibly refreshing, thoroughly engaging, surprisingly timely &amp; delightfully subversive beast fable about prejudice &amp; stereotype that not only marks a new creative high for Disney but is arguably the finest film that this legendary animation studio has come up with in their Revival Era, so far.Set in a world inhabited by anthropomorphic animals, the story of Zootopia takes place in the titular metropolis and follows a bunny cop named Judy Hopps who, despite her par excellent performance in the class, is assigned parking duty by her superior. But when she volunteers to undertake a missing-predator case, she is given 48 hours to solve the mystery or resign, following which she blackmails a sly fox into helping her, and uncovers a sinister conspiracy.Co-directed by Byron Howard &amp; Rich Moore, the duo put up an intriguing world on the screen that does have a fresh quality but there is still a deep sense of familiarity to it. However, where the two leave a lasting impression is in finding that perfect balance between its consistently gripping storyline &amp; moments of pure hilarity. The writing staff also deserves a mention, for their screenplay brims with numerous pop culture references, parodies many renowned classics &amp; handles its topical themes with care.The 3D animation is absolutely top-notch, for the images retain its crispness, clarity &amp; vibrancy from beginning to end. The animators put up a vast number of characters on the screen, ranging from the largest elephant to the smallest shrew, yet they are all given a well-defined arc. Cinematography further enhances the overall look n feel of the story with its fluid camera-work, splendid use of colour palette &amp; spot-on lighting. Editing provides just enough screen time to all the relevant characters while moving the plot forward at a blistering pace.The cast is wisely chosen, and all the actors do a competent job in lending their voice &amp; soul to the mammals they play. Ginnifer Goodwin brings a bubbly side to the new cop in town and confidently plays her role. Jason Bateman plays his part with finesse plus his voice really fits his cynical con artist character. Also, the chemistry between the two is a highlight in itself. Michael Giacchino's ebullient score seamlessly blends in &amp; compliments the narrative while Shakira beautifully wraps everything up with a catchy, uplifting &amp; wonderful song that smartly summarises its themes &amp; message.On an overall scale, Zootopia finds Disney stepping out of its comfort zone to tackle a bold, ambitious &amp; risky project, and it is one gamble that pays off tremendously well in the studio's favour. Also, its arrival couldn't have been better, considering how its elements of prejudice &amp; stereotypes mirror the racial hostilities present in our very own current social environment. An ingenious blend of sophisticated storytelling, jubilant humour &amp; thought-provoking themes that amazes, entertains &amp; enlightens without ever compromising with the fun factor, Zootopia is a definite delight for viewers of all ages, and is undoubtedly the best film of the year, so far. Strongly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Almost Flawless</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film features anthropomorphic animals who wear garments but for some reason no shoes. It centers on a gray rabbit named Judy who pursues her childhood dream in becoming a cop. She fails in her first attempt in police academy. She would, however, return, pass every test and finally become a cop. After dealing with parking violators, Judy is assigned to find a missing critter.Zootopia is as entertaining and funny as any animated film featuring talking animals. Perhaps better, considering the film earned over $1 billion at the box office. Is it flawless? Almost. It would have been absolutely flawless if the young Nick in the flashback wasn't played by a bimbo. That bimbo happens to be the same stupid bimbo who played the stinky purple polecat in Tiny Toons. Is getting a real boy too darn hard?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just amazing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I enjoyed this movie far more than i expected to.Things i liked.The relationship between judy hopps and nick wilde was really special and i enjoyed watching their interaction and growing friendship, they are both as heroic and smart as one another and although judy is this adventurous and outgoing go getter type of character for a few brief scenes she also had an emotional side i think it was delivered with great balance. I take zero pleasure admitting tears were in my eyes throughout this movie.The humour although present throughout was never shoved down your throat which lead to a nice upbeat and colourful atmosphere and that's not to mention all the great design decisions behind the world created here. For example Ergonomics with giraffes in mind e.g a funnel to deliver a drink from ground level to giraffe height and small doors for mice. People should watch this movie for the world alone.I could continue to shower this gem with praise but instead i'll list the things that bothered me about this film, the first thing is that the film was too short like no really i wish this film lasted an hour or so longer, the plot seems incredibly rushed at the end i never saw the plot twist coming and didn't predict the direction the film would go down but i feel it's because the culprit behind it all has come and gone within 5 minutes is arrested there's no build up or tension in the uncovering of the secrets behind the commotion which is a shame. I also feel like the chief of police was a relatively poor character and most of the characters in the film could do with more fleshing out.All things said and done go watch this it is great.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Flawed allegory</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"I cordially dislike allegory in all its manifestations, and always have done so since I grew old and wary enough to detect its presence. I much prefer history ? true or feigned? with its varied applicability to the thought and experience of readers. I think that many confuse applicability with allegory, but the one resides in the freedom of the reader, and the other in the purposed domination of the author."J.R.R. Tolkien would have cordially disliked this movie, to put it mildly. This is an extremely preachy movie, which attempts to distill the racial issues of the USA down into black and white. Two takeaways from this movie:It is perfectly okay for black people to refer to one another as the n-word (IMDB says that is a prohibited word), just as long as non-black people do not:Clawhauser: "O. M. Goodness, they really did hire a bunny. Ho-whop! I gotta tell you, you're even cuter than I thought you'd be."Judy Hopps: "Ooh, ah, you probably didn't know, but a bunny can call another bunny 'cute', but when other animals do it, that's a little..."What a terrible analogy, as "cute" is not a disgusting, reviled word. No one should be calling anyone the n-word, but that's not the point the movie makes. It is telling us that as long as you are the same race as someone else, you can treat that person as horribly as you like. Just as long as people of differing races are nice to one another the world will become a utopia.The second takeaway of the movie is that non-blacks are responsible for all the ills and suffering of black people. Somehow someone white is seeding all the discontent and suffering that black people experience. They are manipulating black people into being "savages" (to use the exact term from the movie).The problem with this totally binary view of the issues of racism and inequality in the USA is that it is inaccurate. It absolves the minority of any responsibility whatsoever. It says that they can maintain the status quo, continue calling one another the n-word, continue murdering one another (93% of murdered black people are killed by another black person), and all of that is perfectly fine. What the movie teaches is that under no circumstances may a non-black use the n-word, rub a black person's hair, or manipulate black people into killing non-black people.While Disney is to be commended for at least attempting to address the subject (and this alone is the cause cél?bre prompting many reviewers to trip over themselves to gush about this film), they should at least address it in an evenhanded, responsible fashion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Life is more complicated...everyone makes mistakes," including this film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on reading the reviews for this film on IMDb, there seems to be quite the love/hate relationship, so I can say off the back I enjoyed the movie, despite its numerous flaws. Is the film too PC? Maybe, but I argue it's too open-ended to really say this. For instance, Zootopia makes a point, with the main character Judy saying that police officers should unite and not divide society. On one hand, it's possible for a viewer on the left to say, "This represents fair criticism of the divisions between society and our police force." On the other hand, someone on the right could respond with, "Judy reminds me of my local police officer who serves with dignity and dedication." My point here is I think you can take what you want to hear out of the film's message to a degree, with both sides having some merit.Another example of the film's open-ended nature revolves around the depiction of the predators and prey. In Zootopia, we encounter the stereotypes of the savage and strong predators and the small and meek prey, both of which Judy and Nick show at certain points. The film doesn't make a clear distinction that one side or another is truly at fault in the plot. Instead, the movie more or less depicts individuals within each group as protagonists or antagonists. This may seem a bit too PC in not wanting to offend any one group, but Zootopia does just enough to poke some fun at these stereotypes and character defects, and I argue that comedy is inherently anti-PC since it subverts one's own beliefs.While I feel the charges of PC are a bit overblown, I do have two criticisms of my own, along with one major complement. My first criticism is that the end of the film is rushed and seems to tie plot points together too conveniently. So as not to spoil anything, I can say that the film reaches this disappointing climax about 75 minutes in. My second, and arguably the more problematic criticism involves the use of animals. I have no issue with the violence (PG is an accurate rating despite arguments otherwise), but suggesting, as the film does, that foxes and rabbits are ultimately the same, just as different human ethnicities are, is problematic and silly.Finally, I love the animation and expect Zootopia to win in that category at the Oscars in '17. I recommend Zootopia with 3 out of 4 stars as though-provoking, if imperfect, at the very least.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Trying too hard.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'll begin by saying that I clearly enjoyed the movie. Yet, since I am not am imb**ile who has a 1\10 or 10\10 rating system and "this sucks" or "Disney means top quality" mentality, I'll have to cynically tear even a fairly made movie in pieces. Because lord knows this movie has a "gazelleon" of flaws.If this movie was a government sponsored child cartoon for ages 3-7, or an otherwise honest movie - I'd be gentler. But it is a Hollywood blockbuster, and a Disney one at that - so it clearly is a lie, and therefore deserves no mercy.First of all, anthropomorphism. It's getting old. Disney has built its empire on turning despicable humans into cute and cuddly drawn animals, but nowadays this trick can play a much darker role. Why are about 30-50% of females in the movie - pigs? And "extremely" cutely animated, practically better than the rabbits? Why is there an obese police officer being appreciated? I'm surprised they didn't stuff some LGBT propaganda in there, seeing how they handled the nudists. I mean, come on, they show the nudists in every dark humor pose imaginable, yet they politely censor it to keep it G-rated. Okay, parents, time to explain your children, why were you giggling or gagging. High time... PC principal has really financed this movie, which is the first layer of lie.Then comes the idea. Do your best. Try harder. Believe in yourself, yadda-yadda. This crap has been shoved down our throats for decades, and, again, if it was an educational toddler cartoon - that'd be fine, but this an all-age blockbuster, and I personally am really tired of this nonsense hero making material. I'll never see a movie about an actual loser getting somewhere, because it doesn't sell or make sense to anyone. Nor will I see a movie, where a hero, strong or weak, lies and steps on the corpses of everyone behind him - to eventually succeed in life. Because that's how life works, and that's not a selling material. Talk about stepping on the corpses, there's a funny scene where the bunny literally jumps over others still trying to get over the ice wall. This scene was a subtle hint at the reality - if you physically can not get over an obstacle, the only way is to train and step on others, who possibly could've gotten over. But... that's not what the movie tells you.Going on, the movie even spoofs itself, when the chief tells the bunny that "this is not some cartoon, where all your dreams come true and you miraculously just become what you've always dreamed to be". Well, something along these lines. Because, hell, this is "exactly" what happened, doh. A crazy bunny succeeds as a sleuth against all odds and reasons. Remembering the the Screen Junkies' catchphrase "what a coincidence", I could quote it in the movie endlessly. That fox you've met before is just barely spotted on the "last seen" photo? That fox knows pretty much everything about the guy? That hippie has machine memory? That fox has access to DMV? There are street cameras cover everything? The girl you saved was a daughter of ...? I could go on, but why spoil everything? Moving on, the whole plot turned from more or less swallow-able to "because I wrote so" at about first third of the movie. And even this first third of the movie was a pain to watch, because what does our poor unappreciated bunny do when she gets a meter maid job? Besides, come on, a child cartoon gets a derogatory term for a police officer. Good going kids, now you know what to cry when you see a real life ***** doing her job. And that's totally legit, knock yourselves out! Back to the point, what does the bunny do when she is tasked to give 100 tickets? She decides to give 200! And, I think, she finally stops just a bit short of 300. And how did the writers apologize for this despicable proof of making your career off the corpses of others? "She worked so hard she forgot about her own parking meter, so she has to give herself a ticket as well". Boo-effing-hoo.After that the movie just went sort of The Nut Job, except for that movie was honest and didn't try to hard, eventually succeeding at being an enjoyable anthropomorphic flick without any propaganda rotting your brain as you watch.So, to conclude, did the Disney do something great? Ehh... not really. I know they can, they've made Wreck-it-Ralph, but this is more like Frozen, also trying too hard. And since I'm more biased towards animals, I guess while Frozen was an ear cancer for me, this was at least a decent watch that didn't immediately revolt me. But it "tried", and this "trying" is the reason I can't really say much good about the movie. Lies are not meant to be praised and given 10\10.But... you could always take your child to be zombified by this propaganda, if you can't do a better job yourself.</fullReview>

Each of the voice actors do a wonderful job playing their characters, the standouts are Ginnifer Goodwin who plays a really likable and relatable character and Jason Bateman who plays a character that is at fist unlikable but manages to improve throughout the film. This is not your typical kids film, it doesn't have the bathroom jokes like in most kids films. The script is smartly written and uses the message effectively unlike others which beats you over the head with theirs.Zootopia is one of my favorite films of the year, if you haven't seen it, give it a chance it's not your typical kids film which is what I like, I just wish more of them were like this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Zootopia is an animated buddy-cop comedy mystery film directed by Byron Howard and Rich Moore. The screenplay is written by Jared Bush, Phil Jonston and on the main voice-role stars Ginnifer Goodwin, Jason Bateman, Idris Elba, Jenny Slate, Nate Torrence, Bonnie Hunt, Don Lake, Tommy Chong, J. K. Simmons, Octavia Spencer, Alan Tudyk, and Shakira. Zootopia is a place where all animals, prey and predator live in peace and harmony. A rabbit named Judy Hops dreams of becoming the first rabbit cop ever and on her journey to her dream she runs into a fox, named Nick Wilde. Together they will try to solve a mystery about some missing predator civilians on the city of Zootopia. I personally loved this film and its message with all my heart. I was in tears by the end of the film just because of how beautiful/creative and well done the message about living in peace and together even though we may be different in race and/or other things (e.g. religion, gender etc). The animation is incredible to look at, this movie is an undeniable visual treat every second of it. It is also very funny and references a lot of other famous movies and TV Shows (Breaking Bad). Kids will have a good time marveling at the beautiful animation and the really likable characters, but I feel like adults will be the ones to enjoy this movie the most. The message that comes across is timeless and very much necessary at this point and time. All the voice work is amazing, Ginnifer Goodwin does a fantastic job on the lead role and Jason Bateman delivered that slick fun tone throughout his likable character. The music is composed by the talented Michael Giacchino, who has been very busy recently composing pretty much every amazing soundtrack on a lot of successful movies. He also does a very good job here, with his composition that delivers what is required on certain scenes. This is one fast paced, interesting, funny and feel good animated film that Disney seems to have become masters at making recently. I did not find anything wrong with it all throughout the film, and it is definitely one of my favorite films of 2016 so far.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wasn't actually too keen on another furry Disney / Pixar movie, but I was swayed. Zootopia is amazingly good and entertaining on so many other levels but cuteness. If nothing else, the whole mobster subplot with "Mr. Big", a godfather in the shape of a shrew (that's a small mouse), won me over. It's amazing how such a large production that requires cooperation on so many levels can still be creative, fun and original. The movie is on a qualitative level with the best of Pixar productions (possibly because Pixar man John Lasseter acted as creative supervisor).What I didn't enjoy at all, however, was having the the usual Disney schmaltz about a young girl making it in the Big Apple against all odds whilst fighting for a multicultural society where all animals, and even rabbits and foxes, live together in peace and harmony to the sound of Shakira, into my face.</fullReview>

Kids, teenagers and even adults would definitely love this film because this contains some "only-adult" moments. A big step for Disney and I'm sure it has entered the Oscar race next year Zootopia excels on so many levels that it stands with the finest of the Disney classics.There's a lot here for kids to like and nearly as much to keep parents from fidgeting.A funny beautifully designed kids' film with a message that it restates at every turn.

America think own country is the best in the world, but there are a lot of discriminations in the American society. Fresh-eating animals means the strong like white people or man. Plant-eating animal means the weak like color people or woman. This movie is so interesting, because one of plant- eating animals doesn't accept the utopia, which is that And fresh-eating animals and plant- eating animals live together.

		<fullReview>The stage of the movie is zootopia which any animals live in. In spite of size and food, various animals live together there. One of main characters, Judy is a rabbit and becomes a police at zootopia. Another main characters, Nick is a fox. Judy struggles an actual state of a gap and try to change it. Then she tries to solve the problem, flesh-eating animals missing. Nick becomes Judy's partner for a strange reason.Judy's constructive way of living and attitude that she never gives up are. I think too brave character like her is particular to animation. Judy's challenges have an important massage like "dreams come true". Moreover multiracial society and multicultural society are reflected in establishment of many kinds animal.This is a just Disney animation film. There are cute characters so from children to adults can enjoy. Not only story line is fun, but also there are many messages. This movie gives me courage and hope.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film tells the story of a small rabbit, who dreams of being in the police force ever since her childhood days. Despite her short physical stature compared to her colleagues, she shines and makes her mark in the country of Zootopia, where all residents are speaking animals."Zootopia" is a fun film with a consistently positive message. It tells how a bunny rabbit can succeed despite everyone around her saying she won't succeed. I like the message of the story, and I like the bull police chief even more because he is funny even though he is an oppressive bully. The fox is a memorable character as well, and as he recounts his childhood experiences, it will strike a chord with many viewers. I enjoyed watching "Zootopia".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cute Judy and handsome Rick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is Disney animation film directed by Byron Howard and Rich Moore. The main character is Judy, female rabbit. Through the process she becomes police officer, she learns a lot about this world.Judy lives in a small rural town with her mother and father. She has a dream to be a police despite of obsession of her parents. There is no rabbit police in the world. So her parents are worries about her secure and want her to be a carrot seller just as them and the rest of rabbits in the town. But Judy feels boring to be a carrot seller. She has a strong sense of justice and enters to the police school. She graduates from the police school with the best record of the students at that time. Then she decides to go to Zootopia to be a first rabbit police. She has a dream to change the world that is equal and no discrimination. Her parents try to stop her but she departures. At first she is treated light and weak, and she has many obstacle to work. But she achieves to expose the secret of the affairs.Putting this story into the human society, this is about racial discrimination and inner conflicts between the strong and the weak. I think Judy did a great job to make them understand that small does not mean weak. In my opinion, the carnivorous animals is white people and herbivorous animals is other people such as the yellow race and the black race. I wish someday we can live without discrimination and prejudice.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A really interesting Disney movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really enjoyed watching the movie and I honestly don't care if it's for kids. The Disney Studios did an absolute good job in the detail that's put on the CGI. The storyline was even great too. I liked how it was different and it made you wanna find out what happened next. This is like any cop shows you see on television such as CSI, Castle, Perry Mason, along with many others. I loved the fact the rabbit Judy and the fox Nick joined together to find the missing weasel. Yknow I would've thought those two were gonna become a couple at the end of the film but, since kids are watching this, maybe not.. Still, they would make a great couple like the other Disney couples! It's a really good film, it keeps you interested from scene after scene and it really lightens your day regardless of what age you are! I also like the fact that it has animals on this so any animal lovers like me would love to see this! I give this an 8/10!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Zootopia is a creative phenomena with many different characters for young ones to love. I took my little sister to see the film and instantly loved each different character and the characters attributes from Judy Hopps to Dash the Sloth. She loved the characters and wanted to be Judy Hopps with the goals in life that Judy wants and chased. The story of the main character is so gripping and close to actual reality the film was very relatable as Judy struggles with people accepting her and has to fight for her position. The only downfall to the film was the parts where the animals jumped out and my sister screamed she was that scared and did not want to watch any more. Other than that the film is a brilliant watch and a good recommend.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A rare gem everyone can enjoy; not quite perfect, but enjoyable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Zootopia is one of the highest grossing animated films of 2016, and for the right reasons. It has unique characters, a clever plot which explores important themes, and stunning animation. It seems people are not seeing the movie for what it is; something that may not necessarily be suited for young children, with themes that should be portrayed in films for an older audience. Regardless, this is a terrific film that the entire family can enjoy, and deserves praise for this.The film revolves around a young rabbit called Judy, who has from a young age aspired to be a police officer. And, from a young age, she has faced adversity in the form of racial prejudice; well, translated into the animal kingdom. This racial prejudice is the key theme of the film, explored through different species of animals rather than different races.To Judy, living in the country on her parents' farm, Zootopia is a far-off city where ''anyone can be anything''. These dreams are completely dashed away when she is accepted into the Zootopia Police Force. Here, she faces discrimination from all corners, including mainly officers at the police department and her boss Chief Bogo, a mean, apathetic buffalo. This comes from the stereotype (another key theme of the film) that rabbits are ''dumb''.Her dreams are almost shattered when Chief Bogo threatens to fire her (for a silly reason), giving her one chance to solve a missing animal case.Teaming up with Nick, a fox con-artist, the pair begin an adventure that changes Zootopia and its prejudice forever.The movie is to be applauded for the impressive way it explores discrimination. Never before has an animated film so stunningly explored these themes in a way that leaves viewers thinking about its meaning long after watching the movie. How it does this is simple; reiterating through Nick and Judy, both victims of prejudice, the harsh stereotypes that are employed by Zootopians. Through Judy, we are able to empathise with her as her experiences unfold. Through Nick, we are able to see how, bullied at a young age via stereotypical discrimination, his life was shaped.In Zootopia, predators are the minority seen as dangerous. Clearly this fear is just another stereotype that is explored cleverly, attempting to show how fear based on stereotypes is commonly unsubstantiated. The characters are unique in this film too. From Judy's protective parents who early on blatantly state how they are happy because they gave up on their dreams, to the resilient and studious Judy herself, Nick the seemingly sly con-artist who really represents far more, the Chief who is an obvious biased and the assistant mayor who is apparently under-appreciated by the mayor himself, although she ends up representing far more than just that.Zootopia features amazing animation, which truly brings to life the characters. In a movie featuring animals this is a necessity and Zootopia definitely fulfills this criterion.But every movie has its flaws. As great as Zootopia is, there are certain aspects that are underestimated in their influence. For example, the film is clearly scary at times. While not obvious at first, certain scenes featuring the ''savage'' animals have the potential to frighten the younger viewers. This is probably a little paranoid, but remembering that this is a kids movie it is important to note.Even more noticeable is the plot. Sure, an adult could follow it with ease. But children are going to have difficulty understanding what is happening. Certain plot developments will not make sense; more so than other animated films because this is a detective story. Of course, for the most part children do not understand plots regardless of their complexity, and thankfully, while not teeming with it, the film does have humour that will entertain the kids.Prejudice within the film is arguably its best feature. However, at the same time it has its flaws, namely that it is explored rather brutally; the Chief is quite rude to Judy, the Fox bully at the start is mean (''you think you will ever be more than just a stupid carrot-farming dumb bunny?''), and Nick's flashback is somewhat graphic. Although these are all eventually resolved, it seems its exploration was harsh.You see, the truth of the matter is that Zootopia is a complex film. It explores themes that usually do not form a part of animated films, through a typical partner-cop detective story, with scenes that may appear in a horror movie filmed as live-action. To the most part it succeeds at exploring prejudice, however its detective story can be confusing at times, and as for the savage scenes, it's clear after a second look that they may appear frightening. Again, perhaps that's paranoid to think, but still.Push this all aside, and Zootopia is a great film. The reason it has been received so well is because it is a film that both kids and adults can thoroughly enjoy, a rarer combination nowadays. It is to be praised for how well it handles prejudicial themes, stereotypes and discrimination, alongside its clever, witty characters that really allow viewers to connect, and quality animation which truly brings the film to life.Zootopia is one of those rare gems that the entire family will be entertained by. Although it does have its flaws, it is definitely up there with the other high rating animated films, both commercially and critically.</fullReview>

After i finished watching the movie, i didn't even dare to shutdown my lap before writing a review. When we move from "school life" to "real life", we fail depressed because the ugly face of life starts to be obvious. Sometimes we accept that we can't really change the world. Everything around us enter this black idea to our minds with all our stresses and fears. Then we watch movies like "Zootopia", listen to true stories of &#x647;nspiring people or even watch TED talks. These kind of flashes which bring hope to our daily lives. They tell us that if we have a great will, then anybody can be anything.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Walt Disney treat!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Byron Howard and Rich Moore direct this animated treat from the Walt Disney Studios. Zootopia is a metropolis of mammals living and thriving in spite of their various sizes, persuasions and genus. A melting pot where animals go about life in their particular neighborhoods. Of course, there is the biggest of the large and tiniest of the smaller animal citizens. There is also the tough and rough; meek and mild sharing a very special habitat. Sometimes bad things happen and push comes to shove. An upbeat and a little bit sassy, Judy Hopps (Ginnifer Goodwin), becomes the first bunny on the police force comprised of the biggest and toughest. Judy is optimistic enough to try and crack one the biggest cases troubling the department. She is bound and determined to prove herself, even if she has to partner up with a scam-artist fox, Nick Wilde (Jason Bateman).This is a fun movie for all age of audience. A little rude humor, but plenty of comedic action. This one is good enough, you'll want to buy your own copy. Cinematography is top notch as to be expected.A very talented group of folks lend voices to the other characters: Idris Elba, J.K. Simmons, Tommy Chong, Shakira, Octavia Spenser, Bonnie Hunt, Jenny Slate, Maurice LaMarche and Raymond S. Persi.A pleasant soundtrack features music from the likes of R.E.M., Eric Carmen, Shakira and Winston Marshall.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In a city of anthropomorphic animals, a rookie bunny cop and a cynical con artist fox must work together to uncover a conspiracy. The only problem i found with Zootopia is that it was kinda humorless i mean i chuckled twice but that's it but i think they wanted to focus more on the characters instead of the laughs and with characters like Judy and Nick Disney proves why they are just so awesome and why they make great movies. The way the movie ends also shows a 2nd part is coming so i hope they do it this is an animated movie that both kids &amp; their parents will enjoy it's smart, it has action and even tho there isn't this big Disney humor the film works thanks to it's characters alone. 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Zootopia Review: Immensely Enjoyable, Surprisingly Topical, Absolutely Unmissable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK)Rating: 4.9/5 starsThe ingeniously conceived and brilliantly executed "Zootopia" offers a subtly delivered, thought-provoking message that's as timely and topical as its gorgeous visual splendor is immersive and delightful. And, it does all this and more while being fast-paced, extremely witty, at times rib-tickling hilarious, and wholly exciting. It's the kind of matured entertainment that doesn't alienate adults but also ensures that it refrains from talking down to kids.The largest elephant to the smallest shrew and everything in between live in the city of Zootopia ? a mammal metropolis, a melting hot- pot of cultures and races, where various animals live in harmony, at least on the face of things. Enter Judy Hopps, the first bunny to join the police force. Her dreams and zeal are quickly sent for a toss when she learns just how arduous a task it is to enforce the law. Not one to ever be deterred, Judy jumps at the chance of cracking a mysterious case that's left the entire force baffled. However, that also means teaming with Nick Wilde, a wily, fast- talking, con-fox who makes her job and life all the more harder.On the surface, this Disney venture is quite conventional on many levels, but as the layers begin to peel off, there's so much wit, flair, and subtle hints at societal woes that it outperforms many a deeply themed, adult-driven drama. This is dressed as nothing but a buddy-cop movie aimed at kids that slowly and unexpectedly metamorphoses into a political thriller, with underlying social and racial themes. A la, George Orwell's Animal Farm with a sweet, modern-day Disneyfied twist ? "Zootopia" almost plays like an LA film noir that delivers a feel-good message about being non- prejudiced to folks, who're different to us in race, and the need for tolerance in an increasingly fearful and diverse world."Zootopia" just scores on so many home runs on so many fronts that it instantly finds itself right up there with the crem?-de-la-cr?me of Disney classics like "The Lion King", "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs", "Beauty and the Beast", and "Aladdin". So entertaining, so satisfying, so introspective.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>And just when you thought graphics couldn't get any better, out comes Zootopia.......The vote of 9 is not because this movie is brilliant in the leagues of say the IMDb top 50 but because of its heart. I think 2 stars will be just for that beautiful song 'Try Everything' by Shakira.The colours are absolutely dazzling. I was surprised because I had left my monitor in my regular (for internet/text) dim/dull setting and I thought I had enabled the 'movie' mode where it spruces things up. I enabled that too, and boy was I in for a treat.The main character is a rabbit who wants to be a cop in a world where the cops are all the large animals, and she would become the first ever rabbit to become a cop. And the story is about the unusual alliance she forges with a wily fox to help her in her adventures in zootopia.The voice actress is Ginnifer Goodwin (Big Love). I remember her positivity and big heartedness from then. And that is what you get here too. A lot of the mannerisms of the rabbit they have taken from Ginnifer. And the rabbit itself is sooo gorgeously beautiful. She had the most beautiful eyes I have ever seen in my life! Zootopia - They have really gone out and developed a whole world for this movie. You keep seeing tiny tiny surprises all the time. The attention to detail is fantastic.Though there was one thing (sort of like the elephant in the room), that they really avoided. What do the carnivores eat? Because even chickens and cows are citizens, what is then left to eat? I saw them eating things like ice-cream, coffee, etc. But what do they actually eat?? This movie is highly recommended. You won't be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting and entertaining story set in Zootopia, a city of animals.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My wife and I enjoyed this movie, we viewed it at home on DVD from our local library.The premise is that this animal society has been able to overcome the natural evolutionary tendency of Predators hunting and killing Prey. As a result animals of all types live in harmony.A young rabbit grows up to believe anyone can strive to become anything if they are willing to work hard enough for it. Voiced excellently by Ginnifer Goodwin, Judy Hopps is the young rabbit that grows up and enters training to become a police officer. She is small but eventually makes up for her shortcomings with cunning and determination.She graduates first in her class but is disappointed to be assigned parking meter duty on her first day. All the others are assigned in groups to look for 14 mysteriously missing animals.Still the investigative instincts kick in and she gets a lead that eventually solves the mystery, the dastardly assistant mayor was running a Walter White type of processing to produce a blue substance extracted from flowers that would cause Predators to revert to their instinctive behavior.It is all very well done, and very interesting movie in spite of being animation. The other most interesting role was Jason Bateman voicing Nick Wilde, a Fox who against his will ends up being Judy's sidekick in tracking down the mystery of the missing animals.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Zootopia/Zootropolis"A bunny (don't call her dumb) is dreaming of becoming a cop, but no one believes her and she wishes to prove all of them wrong. So, when she is placed in the ZPD (Zootopia Police Department), she seeks out help of a sly fox under the name of Nick Wilde, to find a helpless otter who has gone missing and hopes that she can solve the case and prove that anyone can be anything.So, the last Disney film that I saw in the cinema was "Frozen", as you can guess, I loved it. I hadn't seen "Inside Out", but when the film came to DVD, I adored it as well. I was hesitant towards Zootopia (It's called Zootropolis in my country), as the trailers looked okay at best and the advertising gives little away in the way of plot and story for the film. Is this a smart move or is this false advertising?Let's talk about the characters. Judy Hopps (the aforementioned bun-bun) is out to prove that she can be a cop. She is sick of being pushed to the side and stuck with the bum deals, she wants to get stuck in the action and kick some crime out of her way. She proves so, by actually being intelligent and optimistic about the chances she has and tries to keep herself going in the city. She is always beaten down by someone, but she beats them at their own game and is always on top of Nick's arguments. I love the interactions that she has with Nick, the two form a strong and lovable bond by the end of the film and the affection is obviously there in the last proper conversation that the two have before the films ends. She shows off her brains and actually works outside of the box to get her way around the case. Needless to say, I love animals and I was routing for her because of her likable strife that she endures throughout the film and she is practically on the level of Anna from "Frozen" in terms of character and likability.Nick Wilde is a fox. I love this animal. He speaks in the calm and cynical way that many of his type do and he is actually like this in terms of character because of a deep and dark past, but he prefers to keep that memory six feet under his conscience. He clearly grows fond of Judy by the end of the film and he seems to form a connection that not only softens him, but makes him a better person. He had the wise cracks and wit that only someone like he would have and you like him just as much as you do Judy. The double act that they form is hugely memorable and cute.You could make every argument under the sun about whether the two are actually in love with each other or not, I would be lying if I said that I didn't see the relationship. The two are practically meant for each other, the wit and humour that is uttered when they are both on screen is adorable and quick. The actors behind the microphone are clearly having fun here and I can bet that the two were going for more than just the 'best buddies' angle on the two. Regardless, the story is strong and interesting enough to keep you guessing and the city of Zootopia looks mad, but impressive. Having a mature moral that is present in this films is good-hearted and I like that the film is coming out at a time like this. The moral is obvious and it incorporates itself into the characters as well as pop in at the last minute. Gladly, I liked the angle it went for an I'm glad that the message was hammered in a little. This is a time when no one is listening and I think that getting the message across is better than just subtly plopping it in.It's my favourite film of the year and I hope you guys enjoy it as well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sly fox. Dumb bunny.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The few apparent critical lapses in Zootopia range around the fact that its satirical segments are less accurate and immediate than Disney would have liked them to be. This film, even with the universal motivational message, is very much a product of its time, hitting areas like prejudice, gender (animal) roles and stereotyping at a period where they are all the rage - and that includes the backlash that inevitably comes with them. Some are of the opinion that Zootopia's parallels are unfounded and its pre-conceived notions of its predators justified; after all carnivores must eat other animals to survive - it is, like Judy says, within their biology. And others have lambasted the film for attacking prejudiced yet benefiting from those very stereotypes they admonish for a quick laugh; lemmings as the desk workers, wolves unable to resist a howl, bunnies multiply like mad. But by the end of the film it has been established that this is an advanced society - they all walk on two legs, and predators don't eat others anymore, and it was all a big scare so that the prey proletariat could rise up and take over the remaining of Zootopia. And it is easy enough to realise that the core of the film's message doesn't attack stereotyping altogether, but rather the prejudice that leads to little bunnies and foxes being compartmentalised and told off for straying from their pre-determined path. Zootopia is of course visually stunning. I am continually impressed by how much each major animation studio continues to push the boundaries of what can be put onto the screen for audiences to marvel at; Pixar led the way with Sully's individually rendered hairs and it has been improved here so much so that the main characters are remarkably expressive. A twitch of the nose, a droop in the ears, the raising and lowering of eyebrows - the animators have complete control of the facial expression and therefore the emotions that are created from them (a key moment being Judy welling up in tears as well as Goodwin emotionally breaking down - so effective because there is no dramatic or clever speech, no easy way out but to simply admit her wrong and ask for forgiveness). The world of Zootopia has been crafted with great detail and care. The film's most effective scene is something that must be experienced on the big screen - Judy's first entry into the wide world away from the modest BunnyBurrow, as she experiences each unique environment with its own animal settlers from a train zooming across wide swathes of desert, a frosty snowtown, a multi-layered treetop village and finally the glittery urban metropolis where "anyone can be anything". Even in the briefest of glimpses we experienced so much of the world because the animators have crammed in so much life into the frame: the varied-sized doors of the train, the little ice float transports, the water-way for hippos, the hamster tunnels that snake in and out of the environment. A delightful chase sequence in Little Rodentia features a mini-sized version of the same town, delicately tilt-shifted to magnify its effect.The script doesn't manage to complete outrun the clichés that come with the mish-mash of the detective mystery and kids animation. There's the expected failures that confront the bright-eyed, optimistic protagonist that wants to change the world. The policemen inevitably is asked to hand in her badge, but of course conducts her own investigation afterwards. At times the film easily betrays its existence as a mass-marketed story that must be appropriately packaged for children, who will drag their parents and their wallets to the theatre - the bully comes pre-packaged with a neat little apology, and there is no escaping from the celebrity voice cast or obligatory upbeat pop song with its vaguely cheery message. But in many ways it brings new life to the genre. It isn't as insightful as Inside Out, perhaps because humans are a little more relatable than the multitude of animals on display here, but the message is nevertheless a relevant and inspiring one. For years children's films have increasingly moved away from those happy, neatly closed off endings that are so predictable. We ask more varied and interesting challenges and questions of our protagonists, but they are not solved in the conventional way. For the adults, they will appreciate all the throwaway lines that remind us of all the silliness and exhaustion that goes into maintaining these stereotypes in our own lives. And for the kids, they hopefully walk away confident that they no longer need to listen to the voices that tell them they aren't good enough to walk one path.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's perhaps not the best Disney movie ever made, but still a very lovable one, and technically absolutely fantastic. (As all Disney CGIs ever.) The characters are lively and lovely, the story is somewhat predictable, but the lore takes it all the way. A ton of cultural references spice it up for adults, from tongue-in-cheek references to Frozen to Godfather and even Breaking Bad. That's all I can tell about it in general. It deserves a 7 out of 10, for it could've been much more than it actually is, yet the storyline could've used some more polishment.A subtly brave movie I called it, and for a reason. It is a movie which actually dares to criticize multicultural society. The whole set is an utopia, a Zootopia, a city where predators and prey live happily together - also, it's an obvious reference to the Bible - but in fact it's only a hollow ideal. Different animals may coexist, but differences can not be set apart. Stereotypes exist for a reason. Foxes are sly, sloths are slow, rabbits are good at multiplying, and so on. This movie doesn't teach kids to act as if there wasn't any difference between members of different social groups. It doesn't propagate Hollywood's usual and banal clichés about racism and prejudice. It doesn't teach that even acknowledging differences is racism. No, it takes a more rational approach. What Zootopia teaches is this: good persons and jerks come in all shape and color, but stereotypes exist for a reason and the world is not a big happy family, even despite having surpassed violent antagonisms.I personally loved Zootopia for this. I am glad that political correctness and social justice warriors did not stop this movie in the making. This is exactly the voice we need in today's madness when liberal and conservative fundamentalism both try to claim the world for themselves. Also, while the city Zootopia is a biblical symbol, there is a much more stronger biblical message at the end. "Sanctify what you are." A very nice moral teaching. A fox can't be not a fox. But he can be a fox for a good purpose.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Must see for all ages!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is great for all ages. We can each see a little piece of use in each character and love to see how they develop. This movie comes at a great time when the issue of race and ethnicity has become a hot topic and can be clearly examined through the different animals and prejudices each suffers. Its really inspiring to see how each animal can use their strengths to bypass their weaknesses and come out on top. Its also really great to see so many opposing types of animals working together for a common goal, even when they meet at an impasse. This movie could teach kids a lot about working together and remind adults the importance of open mindedness and acceptance.Donald Trump could learn a little something from this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A heavy handed fable for the youngsters</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While this is definitely a kids movie, its one with a good message, even though it is delivered pretty heavily handed. A young bunny decides she wants to become the first bunny cop in "Zootopia", a large city where predators and prey get along. But, as in most movies, not all is as it seems. As I mentioned before, like most Disney movies, this one has a moral message, but its iffy if the younger kids will catch on. This ones, delivers the message that profilying an individual and judging someone for what they are or look like is wrong. This message is laid on pretty thick at times. It also hints that those in power, are in fact always hiding something, or at the very least aware of certain things that are going on and do what they have to to keep them under wraps. If the kids are old enough to understand the message in this movie, sit down and talk about it with them. This may be a good idea, even if the young ones are too young to understand.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Zootopia: when Disney found sweetness again</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Imagine a world where all the animals live freely. But do not picture them barking or howling. They are walking, well-dressed and paying rents in a so organized system that it even includes a Mayor. This whole idea is developed in Disney's new movie, Zootopia. In this world of animals behaving like humans, there is a bunny that stands out for her life goals. Avid defender of animal rights, Judy Hopps dreams about being a police officer to create a better city. The only problem is a bunny has never done this before. Small and cute, Juddy defies stereotypes and becomes the first police officer of Zootopia. Despite her great efforts, Judy only seems to be considered for minor tasks as traffic officer. This will change when she meets Nick Wilde, an underrated smart fox that becomes Judy's main companion in the adventures that eventually evolve in a story full of action, mistakes and a sensible moral. Zootopia is a movie that keeps Disney's old formula: sweetness. The characters are well built, so much you can connect to them form the beginning. The plot is consistent yet full of lessons easy to pick out from a master script. If decades ago you were that kid who watched Aladdin and had the time of your life, go watch this movie. It will be an hour of your life you will never regret.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>We enjoyed Zootopia. The story line was good, the dialog was good, there were a lot of things to laugh at, and the graphics were over the top.The only problem we had was we thought "Zoo" and "Disney" would promise a video that our six-year-old would enjoy. But this was way over his head, and he is an articulate and smart little guy.We were trying to figure out who the target audience was. It didn't seem to us that kids under 10 would get that much out of it. Ten to twenty year-olds might be bored with it. Adults would enjoy it for the reasons listed above, but in that case it would make sense for it not to be animated.This isn't the first movie we felt the same about recently. We felt The Good Dinosaur hit the same notes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Damn Disney has found its magic. it's by far the best animated film I've seen recently. It's dazzling non-stop fun with a charming smart plot. The story is a about bias and understanding. You probably think that's old? Well the way it's done is really fresh and funny. You'll just enjoy the fun and funny while and its message is timeless. The only thing I thought could be better was the ending. But this is minor compared with the innovation and fun of the movie. Maybe the movie achieved so much that it raised your expectation for a better ending, that says how good it really is. This is one movie that I'll buy my own copy.

		<shortDescription>Amusing and action-packed; the message starts feeling heavy-handed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Disney's "Zootopia" is an amusing and action-packed addition to their long history of animated classics. However, at times, the message of the movie does start feeling heavy-handed. We got it the first three or five times: you can do or be anything you want as long as you believe in yourself and go for it. There's also nothing quite like a wholesome half-dressed pop star telling our children to "Try EVERYTHING", right? Aside from those two gripes, a great vocal cast and well-placed humor bring everything together quite nicely."Zootopia" is rated PG for some thematic elements, rude humor and action. Judy Hopps is bullied by her classmates, which might disturb younger viewers or ones who are victims of that sort of abuse. Christians will be offended by the use of God's name in vain in a couple of scenes as well. Judy and Nick visit a nudist colony where animals don't wear clothing. The sequence might stir up some questions about what exactly a nudist colony is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Did we need another anthropomorphic animal movie?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Zootopia seems like an overused concept and was extremely predictable. It felt too much like a cliché and could have used a revised story to deliver the same clear message. Although Disney made their message clear and simple, it was practically meaningless because it was just another movie with Anthropomorphic animals. Also, the characters were not likable to the extent of say Mickey Mouse (and friends), Mulan, Timon, Pumba, Vanellope, Baymax, Olaf, and other beloved Disney characters. I had no feelings for this film's characters at crucial moments of the film, unlike the characters above in their respective films. In other words, the connection between the film and the audience is lacking. On all other fronts, such as animation, music, and more, Disney does a great job at exposing the audience to the world and culture of Zootopia but failed to engage my interest.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Greetings from Lithuania."Zootopia" (2016) is by far the best animated movie i have seen in many, many and (did i just said MANY) many moons. Script is brilliant. Directing is on the spot and perfectly matched the brilliant script, which has many references to classic movies / shows / or some pop culture references, which youngest audience members probably won't be able to understand, but adults will be in nirvana watching this brilliant animation. Voice acting was also superb - there aren't superstars in every role, but that isn't a letdown, because every voice in here is brilliantly matched to the character, not the other way around. And there is a sequence with Flash - a killer scene.Overall, i do not know what other animated masterpiece should be born in the rest of 2016 that would claim Oscar for best animation in next years Oscars. This is a big winner, which i think can easily gain nomination for the best original screenplay. "Zootopia" is colorful, superbly funny, excellently paced and amazingly written animated movie which is easily my favorite movie so far this year. Brilliant stuff.</fullReview>

I love how this movie is something that adults can enjoy and appreciate -- it's not just some superficial kids cartoon, it's genuinely deep and intricate. Something I love so much above everything else that was amazing about this film is the moral that relates so much to what's going on in the world now, but is also universal. The moral of this film is unity, acceptance, tolerance, anti-racism, anti-sexism, doing what is right, resilience, respect, challenging assumptions, persistence, equality, and that we are all ultimately the same and are one. This movie was beyond anything I'd imagined it to be. I had heard some great stuff about it and decided to watch it and I'm so glad I did. Kids will have fun watching this movie and learn valuable morals. Adults, on the other hand, will immensely enjoy watching this movie, will appreciate it for what it truly is and will understand its real meaning. This movie is just absolutely amazing, the best I've seen all year! Please watch it, you will not be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>We were prey and predators once, antagonizing each other. But it was thousands of years ago, now we're all evolved, peaceful and equal. And if anything falls out of that paradigm then it's definitely a result of some malicious interference.That's basically the message of Zootopia. Calling it utopian is hardly insightful, but there's no better way to describe it. An upbeat and positive story of a little bunny who wanted to be different and to change the world by making it a kingdom of kindness and equality once again - that doesn't seem remotely realistic, even if the story was not about animals but humans. Still, with nice visuals and enough goofing around, it's exactly what would keep kids captivated for enough time so that their parents could get their much-needed precious rest. By being somewhere else or doing something else.And I mean it. Zootopia may be full of surprises for the young generation, but it's not a film that can provide a second layer an adult viewer could enjoy. There's no subtlety, instead, everything is explicit and for show, so any attempt to demonstrate some character development is somewhat staged. The difficulties are temporary and solve themselves without much labor. So, at the end of the day, even rooting for the happy ending is not too engaging because it never really seems that it could happen any other way.It's hard to blame Disney for a lack of the real-world complexity. After all, it's what they do: flicks for kids. And those flicks are more or less fairy tales where the good wins simply because they want us to believe in goodness and uphold it. However, there's a thin line between teaching the good and claiming that it's the natural way for everyone, which could be corrupted but is still something we all perceive equally. And while the fairy-tale thinking, despite being obviously naive, bears no big harm, the white lies of the latter approach create a much more distorting illusion. An illusion that we're all the same inside and that we all want to be the same.Come think of it, there might even be a second layer in Zootopia. Unfortunately, that layer looks like some sort of leftist propaganda, telling us that whoever we are, we have no other destiny but to stay united. That no matter who you are, a predator or a prey, a Muslim or an atheist, a Syrian refugee or a German burgher, living together is something that all of you must want and love. And if you wanna separate and set your own order of things, even if you're a vast majority, then there's something wrong with you and you're definitely a bad guy. No dude, stay put and love your neighbors, even if they bang at your wall and yell all night. And don't you dare expecting them to apologize for it!For more than half a century the real-world us were being told that there's no other way, and those who disagree should be branded fascists. So it's quite symbolic that I got to watch Zootopia just a few days after the British people showed the world that an alternative is possible. So nice try Disney, but sometimes it's better to ask difficult questions rather than to make up overly simple answers. And a word of advice to the audience: if you so desperately want a Disney's fairy tale about the world's issues, watch Tomorrowland instead. It's equally simplistic, but at least it leaves you the freedom of choice without stamping the moral labels on it.</fullReview>

From what I hear, this is now the greatest Disney cartoon ever, surpassing "Frozen" as the greatest Disney cartoon ever. But I don't know if I would quite go that far. This one seemed too dark at times, and the message got jumbled -- it was clearly an anti-racist message, but there was still the underlying theme that "people" had a nature to overcome. Heck, look at the sloths.But there is a lot of potential here with the world they have built. Sequels and spinoffs seem likely, and possibly a television show.

		<shortDescription>Disney stays hot with entertaining, very socially relevant "Zootopia"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For a studio that in modern times has taken a lot of flak for past racist cartoon depictions, Disney has come a long way with "Zootopia." It's as though someone at the Mouse House must have off-handedly said how great would it be if they could make a kids' movie about racism and classism and one if not all seven writers with story credits on "Zootopia" raised their hands and said "challenge accepted."Indeed, the CGI-era non-Pixar team at Disney has done just that, hitting its stride big time after "Wreck-It Ralph" and "Frozen." (This critic has regrettably yet to see "Big Hero 6.") "Zootopia" has all the best trappings of an entertaining animated family film with ample wit and heart.Yet while most animated films featuring talking animals simply for marketing purposes, the writing team (again, too many names to name here) offers an explanation of sorts. Much like 2012's "Wreck-It Ralph" built an entire film around video game characters existing beyond the screen, "Zooptopia" ? which borrows all four writers from "Ralph," including its director (Rich Moore) ?crafts a world in which animals have evolved beyond survival instincts (and humans don't exist) and try to live together in harmony. By turning species characteristics into stereotypes and creating a predator-prey distinction, Disney lays the groundwork for an incredibly socially relevant movie."Zootopia" follows Judy Hopps (Ginnifer Goodwin), a bunny who has aspired for her entire life to become a police officer in the mammal metropolis of Zootopia despite everyone telling her she's supposed to be a carrot farmer. But the story isn't so cliché that it results in some "anyone can be anything" tale. It goes well beyond, testing Judy's idealism and can-do spirit after she meets sly fox Nick (Jason Bateman) and starts to investigate a missing mammals case. The references to race and class are not subtle, and they go beyond serving as accompanying themes to movie. While kids will certainly not pick up on all of them, the filmmakers' intent is clearly to draw on examples of racism and prejudice from our world and introduce them in ways that kids can grapple with. There are elements of mystery and themes of friendship and believing in yourself, but "Zootopia" stands out for making this concerted effort to highlight divisions and differences and how they do not define us.The seriousness of this subject matter does not subvert the kid-friendly tone of the film, however. There's definitely a certain maturity to it (and even some scary moments), but the creative team has put together a colorful, vibrant world with various amusing characters and silly moments. Yet it's heart that really elevates "Zootopia." The big issues and themes allow it to go into somewhat uncharted animated territory, but also the characters of Judy and Nick are thoughtfully constructed. Judy is perhaps the perfect heroine and her journey is so incredibly sincere; Nick has the potential to be a bit more of an archetype, but he has many complex shades that help convey this notion that no character can be put in a box. The story really goes out of its way to make that point too."Zootopia" isn't George Orwell's "Animal Farm," but it might be the most socially conscious and intelligent offering in the 20 years of this CGI era. The fact that kids and adults should enjoy it equally only makes it the more impressive. While Pixar has the clout, look at the last five years and Disney Animation's body of work is more impressive (and without any sequels). We should look forward to both with equal eagerness. ~Steven CThanks for reading! Visit Movie Muse Reviews for more.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Words can't describe how amazing this movie was. I watched it for the first time just yesterday and it was so cute and adorable, not to mention hilarious. As with any Disney movie, all the references for an older audience were much appreciated. Especially all the Godfather references. The only thing they could have done without was all the heavy handed social satire in reference to marginalized races or cultures (in this case, the predators) being grouped together based on just a few instances. This movie does contain and even hinge on some mature themes for a kids movie. For instance, officer Hopps gets Nick Wilde to help her because of "fellony tax evasion." I'm sure every 8 year old who went to see this with there parents understood fully why Nick went along with Hopps. Anyway the characterization was excellent and as far as animated kids films go, i think it was one of the best Disney has created in a while. Certainly a must see for all ages. Just if you are with your younger kids, expect to have to explain some things.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Refreshing idea</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Zootopia is very refreshing movie. Disney's are mostly creating movie with princesses and that kind of stuff but in this movie once more they tried something new. In this movie everything is good as always as expected from Disney except songs I think this movie songs are not as good as in other Disney movies. So, besides this everything is great. In the movie they tried to show whatever humans do that are doing by animal means human are not there only animals and animals are pretending to be human. So they very nicely put everything all together and show it as what they are. As giraffe, rat, lion, sheep, rabbit etc., predators, non-predators working together that the best part for me and I really think that director also take too much time how to put all of them together. The movie starts with rabbit want to become police officer before this no one in rabbit ever become police officer so they showed it as challenge. So, after she cleared the police academy exam she joined the police force as in police force they also underestimated her and her boss did not give her the job what she like instead she got the meter maid job. So, in the city some people are missing somehow she got the job for finding those people. Then real story of the movie starts and you have to watch this movie. At last one motto dialogue I like which we can also use in our life "Anyone can be anything".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A pretty great Disney film which has a fair amount of originality</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When this movie was released, movie goers' jaws dropped over its long lasting 100% rating on RT. It has since lost it, but when it had it, I grew a great interest in checking it out. After reviews were starting to come out, I heard some people say that it was one of the best Disney animated films ever made. That's when my curiosity flew off the radar. I needed to watch it to see if it really was as good as some people were saying it was.I think that it was a great movie. That's all I can really say for it.After a bunny named Judy Hopps fulfills her dreams of becoming the first bunny police officer in a large city called Zootopia, she partners up with a fox named Nick Wilde to search for an Otter's missing husband. As they discover more info about what should be a normal case, their investigation quickly develops into something much, much more...One thing that I really liked about this film was its comedy. A common complaint I have with animated films is that their jokes tend to be geared more towards younger kids. However, this film was actually very funny. This is probably the most I've laughed at an animated film in a long time. My parents and I were having a blast laughing at its jokes. My favorite scene from the film was the sloth scene. They did just about everything you could do with that scenes' set piece, and they made the most out of it. Also, I liked the scene where they made references to multiple Disney films by changing their titles slightly and putting in an animals name into it. If I get this on DVD, I'll make sure to pause it at that scene so I can read all of them. I also liked the gang scene with Mr. Big. The punchline wasn't exactly the most original one they could've used, but I still chuckled quite a bit at it. The only thing they could have done to improve it was by putting in a "The Godfather" reference.I feel like this film went on for just the right length. It didn't seem too long, nor too short. At first, I thought that it was going to end too quickly and make the same mistake that "Big Hero 6" did. However, I was gladly proved wrong, and my concern was quickly nullified. The final half hour helped to make its pacing and length hit just the right note.I feel like the most impressive aspect of the movie was its social commentary of today's racism involving Muslims. This was represented by how the animals discriminated against meat eaters. I can't think of a single animated film which has displayed social commentary before. I was pretty impressed with how they handled it. The symbolism was pretty creative. The reveal of meat eaters being targets resulting in a discrimination of meat eaters in the film can be a metaphor for how 9/11 led to the discrimination that Muslims face today. I really loved how it had the guts to hide such a horrifying day in it. Also, its racism was well hidden into the film. Racism is a pretty hard concept to symbolize without having it become obvious. However, they successfully did it without making it feel obvious. I thought about the film a lot to come up with my interpretation. I have to give the director a lot of credit for accomplishing that.With all the praise I've given it, it seems like this is well deserving of a 10/10 rating. I can safely say that it could have easily been one, but a choice they made really bugged me a lot throughout the film. My complaint was that Judy's relationship with Nick was very predictable, and I was able to correctly predict what would happen concerning them. The very minute that Judy started working with Nick, someone who she was mad at near the beginning of the film, I was instantly able to predict that the movie was going to have them slowly become friends throughout the movie as they spend more time together. I was also able to predict that just as their friendship would about to become official and complete, Judy was going to do something that would get Nick mad at her, and their friendship would be temporarily destroyed, only for them to make up right before the final act. Unfortunately, my prediction was completely correct. As I continued to watch the film, my prediction kept on looking more and more valid, and I was taken out of the film a few times as a result of this. It's quite a shame too, because this film sure had the potential to be a masterpiece.In conclusion, I thought that this was a pretty great movie. It definitely works very well in some aspects. In fact, it blew me away for doing some things differently or better than most animated films I've seen. It has quite a fair amount of originality to it. That could be a reason why some people love it so much. However, all I can say for it is that it was a great film. Nothing more. Nothing less. I would like Disney to use this film as a reference point though, and I think that they could make many better films in the future by taking a few pages out of this film. Is it one of the best Disney animated films ever made? No. However, is it a great film worth checking out? Yes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Magical Feat that isn't Just an Illusion..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The litmus test to confirm art and disconfirm empty-calorie entertainment is a comparison between the elements that can be found in both. There's a moment, early in Zootopia, in which our heroine is making a pop-song-backed montage-trip to her destination; the kind of scene that would otherwise typify hollowheaded Furious-7/Rom-Com style movies--yet, how does Zootopia leave that sequence feeling closer to Potemkin than Pootie Tang? The montage cuts between establishing shots that are traveling closer to the center of Zootopia, but a crucial difference between this and the Cliché is, one visual element is shared by all subsequent shots; the Heroine's Vessel. The train defines the narrative purpose of each shot as taking the hero closer to their destination, instead of just showing how the second unit had virtual cameras running everywhere along the way to the city. The train will also turn out to be part of a Chekhov's armory for a resolution later in the movie.The plot of the movie, once you untangle the Noirish vines it wraps itself in, is a plucky young bunny heroine becomes a cop and flies to the Big City with a buoying air of idealism under her wings; she's here to Change the World. Make it a better place than she thinks it is. It's worse. She'll meet a shifty fox who'll challenge and disillusion her as much she'll amuse and enamor him. They'll earn from each other a reciprocal respect and more, and together, they'll make an indomitable, unlikely duo. It's the plot of a thousand movies, The Silence of the Lambs is the best of the kilo, and Zootopia runs a few paces behind it. The animation in the film is great enough to meet the greatest expectations, with an added layer most of the time missing; the characters are allowed to have nonverbal (and we guess off-screen) dramatic reactions to the proceedings, and every revisiting of the feature deepens them farther; they have an existence of their own, and aren't just saying their dialogue because wisecracks would be funny in a family movie. They own their platitudes. A rare feat. One aspect I loved even further is the Rainforest District, a rain-beaten Neo-noir Verde-vista which the characters unwisely visit and are met with a feline misadventure. It's a bold step for an animated/otherwise-Disney film to have a section in its World that isn't colored like fruit drops...and has fierce Carnivora that leap at us to equalize our interspecific excitements.Most of the humor in the movie is generic; it's all the usual high-speed-chase falling-from-a-bridge humor that drew its last laughs in the 90s. By now it should be plagiarism. Yet, because it's character-centered here, and the movie lets us warm to its characters, it's like a friend telling you an old joke, you laugh not because it's funny again, but you're glad you're having the time together.There is a substantial flaw however. The narrative bears an over-reliance on off-screen events and obscurant camera placement; the only way the screenplay knows how to resolve an urgency is pulling a resolvent carrot out of a hat; you didn't see us hide this! It wears itself into contrivance. There's also an overstatement of visual information using reiterative flashbacks. Kids should use their memories even at the movies.One of the few scenes that have wrought the teaspoonful of half-negative reviews the film has gotten is the Sloth sequence at a DMV office. If the movie is against stereotyping, then oh, why are all the sloths with jobs and speaking roles in it lethargic, as if constrained by their biological limitations even in a family film? Those who complain about this scene didn't stay for the epilogue to see the setup subverted. It's what marks the difference between good satire and generic parody; satire sets up the tropes again within its own story's context to demolish them with focus, yet parody just gobbles up the setups made in other works and belches lazy punchlines. The sloth sequence was necessary to prove a counterpoint, instead of simply stating one."We may be evolved, but deep down, we're still Animales.." so observes a Mr. Big in the film. He's paraphrasing a compagno of his, from an earlier version of himself, who said about black folks, "They're Animals anyway. So let them lose their souls." Of course, his compagno, in spite of being a Sabre-toothed ligature-tooting predator, excluded himself from the Animales subcategory; he didn't even presume to be the gamekeeper. I know, I'm annoying you, comparing a 'kiddie movie' to a god-daddie movie, but one thing the confronto illustrates is even the dimmest film characters are evolving, at least on the top shelf of the art form.In this era where movies are blighted by on-the-nose dialogue (even very good ones like Interstellar) and fortune-cookie messages, sometimes with very sour fortune cookies, we seldom open the valves of our hearts to them. A lifetime's worth of product-line-assembled mediocrities has given us constrictive pericarditis.Zootopia is like a pericardiectomy that peels away that hardened pericardium, and lets our hearts expand with joy again...if only for 108 minutes and 32 seconds. Until we walk out of the screening and are assaulted by the Batman v Superman posters outstaying their welcome on the cinema walls, that fill our ventricles with venom again; not a result of the counterfeit product they're marketing being powerful enough, or powerful at all, to make us feel anything by itself; all it does and can do is steer backwards (and blindly) from every paragraph in this review. No half-good movie would ever do that.I love movies more than most things (anything?), but, I prefer to hate them; it's much more fun to frame-by-frame them, and deconstruct their technique than to futilely mine them for oft-nonexistent Deeper Meaning. Zootopia earns a high grade on both levels; it's the rare big movie you actually root for at the movies.8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are things I love about Zootopia, as this movie is really good about hitting the right marks. Idris Elba voice-work? Check. Relevant and funny social commentary on race and contemporary race relations? Check. AN EXTENDED GODFATHER JOKE?!? Super check! Heck even the size differences between the products and appliances the animals use and the way they are integrated together is pretty genius. And ohhhhhh the little details in the animals like the way the wolves cock their heads ti the side when confused is great!! So where does this movie mess up? For one thing it does the common kid movie trope of having irrelevant emotionally manipulative scenes complete with sad music for no reason other than to try to make the audience feel upset. There are some pretty big plot holes, like how did they not hear the wolves howling in the panther scene? How did they cut in front of the entire DMV? Also towards the end the movie seems to give up and just give away all the remaining mysteries as easily as it can in the narratively weakest way possible. But overall this movie is funny, decently animated, and a lot better than your average kids movie. I give it a 7.5 out of 10 and recommend people to definitely check it out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Truly a film for everyone</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When it comes to being a parent, part of the deal is to watch kids' films. Sometimes this can be a painful experience - let's just say that my kids and I differ radically in our assessment of Alvin and the $*&amp;^?!*ing Chipmunks. On other occasions, however, the experience can be joyful. I went into this film with low expectations, and unexpectedly had a ball. I honestly found it laugh-out-loud funny, and so did my kids. Moreover, we often laughed at the same scene for different reasons. My kids have never seen the Godfather, for instance, and neither have they (yet) had to deal with a government department whose speed of service would be improved by replacing everyone with sloths - but there were elements in these scenes which worked for them as well as the bits that worked for me. It is very difficult to produce a film that really is for everybody, but this is one of the very best.To be sure, the "moral lesson" is clichéd and obvious, many of the characters were simple stereotypes, and the plot twists were more than a little predictable. Such things matter little to kids, however; and I can live with them when things are handled with zest and panache. The action is fast-paced, the acting first-class, the animation state-of-the-art - and the sight-gags are both brilliant, and scattered in such profusion that you probably don't have time to catch them all on one viewing. All in all a wonderful film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I got a $50.00 PlayStation gift card from my daughter for fathers day and I couldn't find any games I wanted and my grandchildren were running around screaming as usual so I bought Zootopia. Great film for both kids and adults alike. Funny, serious,a twist at the end even I didn't see coming. The grandchildren were so quiet and peaceful...this only happens when they sleep. Anyway, I highly recommend this film for ANYone with children, grandchildren and even if you're an adult who's a kid at heart, watch it. Rent it. It's a movie that just makes you smile and bond with your kids. A lot of people must have shared my opinion because it more than doubled what it cost to make. You decide for yourselves...but I'm right. WATCH IT.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disney's bravest and most relevant film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Cute, talking animals are, of course, nothing new when it comes to Disney. Whether they are an anthropomorphic swash-buckler or a wide- eyed human's sidekick, I couldn't name one of Disney's animated output that didn't feature a cuddly creature. Their latest, Zootopia, may seem much more of the same then, with it's richly- imaged world of upright rabbits, polar bears, hippos and the like, all living together in harmony in the titular metropolis. You can put away your preconceptions however, as Zootopia is without doubt the corporate giants bravest and most relevant picture to date, and one with a strong message for its young audience that will hopefully rub off on at least a few viewers.Young, determined bunny Judy Hopps (Ginnifer Goodwin) grows up in the rural Bunnyburrow, a small town in a larger world where predators and prey have evolved to live together peacefully. Her parents hope she'll grow up to appreciate the quiet life of selling carrots and raising a family, but she has other ideas, and hopes to one day travel to the big city of Zootopia to become a police officer. Despite facing prejudice due to her gender and her size, she eventually graduates from Police Academy top of her class, and is soon in Zootopia fulfilling her dream. But when she arrives, her colleagues instantly doubt her ability as the precinct is traditionally made up of more formidable animals, and is quickly assigned to parking duty by Chief Bogo (Idris Elba).Frustrated at the clear-cut discrimination, Judy decides to be the best parking attendant there ever was. It is while she is stamping every vehicle with a ticket the second they're in violation that she learns that prejudice goes both ways, meeting the seemingly down- and-out fox Nick Wilde (Jason Bateman), the exact kind of prey Judy suffered physical harm from as a child. Her suspicions turn out to be true, and Nick is indeed a 'sly' fox, but comes to learn that he acts like a fox because society treats him and expects him to be like one. Begging for a chance at something more challenging, Bogo gives Judy the task of tracking down missing person Mr. Otterton with an ultimatum that she must resign if she fails. Suspecting his street-smarts may be of an asset to her investigation, Judy blackmails Nick into helping her, and uncover a series of bizarre incidents where predators are returning to their primal state.While it may sound like a heavy-handed educational piece on the folly of racism and pre-judgement, it actually isn't, as Zootopia is also an explosion of imagination for the vast majority of its 110- minute running time. Judy's arrival at Zootopia, as she is whisked through an array of eco-systems, designed to sustain the many different kinds of inhabitants, is a complete joy. While some jokes fail to hit the mark, like the Godfather gag that may have been funny thirty years ago, others are ingenious. It may seem obvious to employs sloths at the DMV, but the scene is still laugh-out-loud even though they played it in it's entirety in the trailer. But Zootopia isn't memorable for its comedy value, but the way it delivers its message. Without being preachy or overly-sentimental, the film actually feel frustrated at society. We have surely evolved past pretty prejudice and stereotyping, so what drives the hate? The film hints at fear induced, which is a bold statement on its own.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very refreshing movie which brings in something brand new from Disney</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Zootopia promises to entertain you right from the beginning till the end. This is probably one of those rare times when Disney has taken a shot on suspense and it has done brilliantly well on it. Story (10/10): Full marks to the story which is probably the most profound story I have seen after Inside Out. Zootopia talks about the struggles of the only bunny cop - Judy Hopps - town has, and the challenges she faces while performing her duties due to various stereotypes. It is very hard to stay put against the disgust and bullying of everyone, which is beautifully depicted through Judy Hopps characterization. The writer has created a complete contrast character, Nick Wilde, a fox, who gives up against those same stereotypes. He, ironically, helps her in solving the case involving mysterious turn of events in the city. The story has very interesting twists and turns almost every now and then which keeps you wondering what will happen next. The other characters like Chief Bogo, Bellweather, Bonnie and Stu Hopps are very well conceptualized where they all are bound by their preconceived notions, ambitions and greed that pretty much is a microcosm of what Zootopia town has been. Animation (8/10): The level of animation has been good. The creativity that went behind projecting the city and its various facets is outstanding. Although Hollywood has moved slightly ahead but Zootopia stay puts. Direction (9/10): The trio of Byron Howard, Rich Moore and Jared Bush have done a great job in keeping the story moving and bringing in twists and turns all the time which keeps the audience glued to their seats. Bringing in Shakira for the song, "Try Everything" and the novelty in the end credits is simply brilliant. Overall (9/10): Overall, it is a very refreshing movie which brings in something brand new from Disney. A must watch for everyone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Relevant to a fault and gives an important lesson to its young and adult viewers alike bundled in an entertaining package</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There has never been a dearth in good animated movies especially the ones catered to young audience and Zootopia makes no exception. Beneath its charming lead characters, kids friendly action and comedy, an interesting plot and top notch animation lies the premise which is designed to be too metaphorically equivalent to current society which I think could be the only downside to this entertaining romp. Any standard stereotype tag you name it, you got it here - underdog, buddy cop, judgmental society, prejudice, beyond all odds, **spoiler alert** projected-good-character-is-the-villain etc. It is a world where animals of all species have evolved to shed their natural instinct and live harmoniously in the same society. Judy Hopps (voice by Ginnifer Goodwin) is a feisty young bunny from a small town who is determined to become the first bunny cop in Zootopia. Despite the prejudice and the physical limitation, she successfully enrolls and completes the Police training with top honors through sheer hard work and wit. When a sensational case of 13 missing mammals breaks the headlines, the Police Chief Bogo (voice by Idris Elba) overlooks Hopps and assigns her the traffic duty. Her judgmental view on fox species lets her catch a petty thief Nick Wilde (voice by Jason Bateman) a stumble upon a lead on the missing mammals. Clearing obstacle after obstacle she uncovers the abduction of all the missing mammals that points the Mayor Lionheart (voice by J.K. Simmons) as the chief accused. But is it the end of investigation?There are many aspects that contributes to a good movie or story, either some more aspects or bettering the existing ones make them great. But the level of audience connect with the story makes them a classic. Zootopia falls short of the classic level but has everything to make it great. First and foremost, is the story interesting and entertaining? Full marks for that. Are you able to relate to setup and get involved in its plot? Sure. A lead character that you would want to root for, a wily fox that breaks your stereotype, a supremely entertaining Godfather- esque episode, a ROFL worthy extended sequence involving a sloth, a nude sequence that jumps on you, a thrilling chase through the rodent town and many more. It also has a moral on not crossing a limit to get even - which is very important for young viewers.Despite its familiar premise, generous use of stereotypes and pop culture references and a Scooby-Doo style plot - there is a maturity and skilled handling of some sequences which results in winning moments and that's exactly what makes a movie successful. On top of its beautiful animation it is complemented by excellent voice performances and minimal and apt use of background score. Relevant to a fault and gives an important lesson to its young and adult viewers alike bundled in an entertaining package.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to admit that i never really waited this movie. I only gave it a chance because I saw the love what this film get from the internet. Then i watched it and wow... I can't really tell why it is so good maybe the story witch is more complicate that you wait from a furry movie, maybe the main characters who's are really good together maybe something else. I only can tell that i love every part from this movie (yes including the Shakira singing and everybody dancing part what is necessary in a Disney movie...) and this become one of my favorite animation. The only thing is that in my opinion you shouldn't watch this with a 6-7 year old folk because he may be scared and maybe don't really understand the plot. I think the perfect age is somewhere between 14-15 years old because they can understand the main problems what the movie brings up and they can fully enjoy it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>**** May contain strong spoilers ****This is a review made by StoneDraim... and that means that if you want to read a probably different kind of review, keep reading....This is my personal experience, my personal point of view/perspective and my personal opinion... and my opinion is just one of like 7 billions in this world."If you never try, you never fail!" HAHAHAHAHA! I love... I adore the way this movie begins. A bunny makes through police academy, says goodbye to the family and make the turn to the big city. Along with the story goes amazing song "Try everything". That graceful and dream flattering touch within the song made this story kick off in a ricochet way and then just continued to aim and shoot for the stars. When the first notes of the song with its "Oh oh oh oh oh" reached my ears, the tears started to gather and my errector pili (yes, try and look that up on...well try Altavista for once....) go wild! Thank you, Disney! This is one reason (and bulls eye of that reason), why I clap my hands and hold American musicians and music dearly within my heart.The animations is breathtaking.... I am in awe! Magnificent and awesome!A little story of a bunny taking the opportunity to be an detective so solve a case leading to different scenarios. Little interesting touch in an animated movie to put crime and the work of an detective in front. Nice.Amazing scene with sloths. Here in Sweden, every Christmas Eve there is a program on the television at 3 pm showing old cartoons. It's called "Donald Duck And His Friends". At the end there is one or two snippets from new animated movies. Zootopia were shown 2015 in that program on Christmas Eve. I laughed hard at the sloths....so hard! Disney has again shown that animated movies is just as much for adults as they are for the youth and children.I will leave the rest up for you. Enjoy this one!No...just wait.... I have to add the phenomenal parody Zootopia does of The Godfather. The accent, the way the mob leader express himself... oh... it is exactly how Marlon Brandon did it in 1972. Magnificent!Over to the movie as a product: - The production : Excellent! I am in awe of the animations! - The actors : Nailing every character! Ginnifer Goodwin, Jason Bateman (one of my favourite actors)... massive work! - The story : Disney almost always have a deep moral woven into the stories. So even here. Very good! - Entertainment : Laughs. Tears. Warmth. Feel good. - Age : From 7... and I feel, that is correct. Some things that claims some maturity, as for a seven year old.7,7 out of 10. (The final rate is based most on my own entertainment of the movie. Short elucidation of the rating: 8 Excellent movie and a solid production 7 Well made movie. Proper entertainment.)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was a great film. My son loved it and I'd watch it again. Obviously it's no where as good as the classic Disney films but I loved how they talked about prejudice and had so many lessons that kids can learn. I would probably watch a sequel if it were to come out but sadly I don't think it's going to be a huge movie that can withstand time. The parents of the main character were annoying but I think that was to show how some parents are viewed by their kids(haha). Overall I think that the intent behind the movie was great especially for young girls. It showed that you can be anything if you try hard enough. It shows that even the people that seem great on the outside aren't always good and that they might not have your interests at heart. Great lessons for young kids and a wonderful little world that Disney built for this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't remember the last time an animated film's themes were so political and so prominent in everything the film was trying to do. Huge props to this, a family animated film focusing so heavily on race, prejudice, and equality? Incredibly fresh, exciting, and a very, very significant theme to introduce to children. For that reason alone it should be praised. The themes aren't subtle, but they can't be, not for the target audience here. Of course, the film is also incredibly well-written. it follows a specific formula, but boy does it do it well. Funny and witty, emotionally-heartfelt, incredibly entertaining. I'm not surprised it turned out to be such the crowd-pleaser with both audiences and critics. The voice work is also fantastic (I just love Bateman voicing animated characters). Jenny Slate was also a hoot. This will definitely be in the running for the Oscar for Animated Feature.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Funny and smart</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Zootopia" is an American animation movie from this made by Disney. It runs for slightly under 110 minutes and was written and directed by Byron Howard, Rich Moore and Jared Bush. The voice acting cast includes a couple known names, but no really big superstars. I will not go into detail there as I watched the German dub (surprised to see Lau with such a minor character), but it's nice to see Simmons and Elba associated with this project. Check out the cast list for further voice actors. The story is fairly simple as it is about a young rabbit girl who tries to be successful with the police force. But there is a lot more depth to it of course: the fact that there has never been a rabbit in there, the crime story or the main character's relationship with the fox or foxes in general.The only reason why I do not rate this film higher is that it somehow came short on the emotional side, at least for me. The standard is really high right now for animated films because there are so many good and great ones from recent years. But "Zootopia" or "Zoomania" as it is called here is still a success. Just not a triumph. It is a funny watch from start to finish thanks to a really interesting story and also very entertaining supporting characters. There are so many of them, but I guess my favorite is the Godfather opossum. This spoof was pretty hilarious. This scene is also one of these that makes it interesting to grown-up audiences. Another one would be the Breaking Bad parody near the end. The times when animated films were only for children are long gone. If they ever even existed, that is.I had a really good time watching this film. It is fairly long for an animated film, but yet it never drags and this is a success too. The main character is certainly very interesting and they almost could have made a film just about her time at the police academy. And that one would have been good too. Beyond that, the cuteness helps a lot too, even if I should not say that as a non-rabbit creatures as I learned from the film. The animation is very very good, but that is almost self-explanatory these days. The story with animal characters living like humans creates some nice truth if we see it from the perspective that they act like us so many times. Also provides great entertainment. And something which is not too usual is that it takes almost until the very end for us to find out the real criminal mastermind here. I liked it and I did not see the plot twist coming. It works well though and makes a lot of sense in the face of enemies not always being the ones who we think they are. The film offers bulls, opposums, lions, foxes and more as antagonists until we find out the real truth. (At some point, I actually believe the concept of fear would be the main antagonist, but that may have been too philosophical.) But it also shows how flawed they are, which is very realistic from the perspective that we see them as the equivalent to humans. Especially that reference about the lion mayor trying to hide things that get his career into danger was very witty. Finally, as a German viewer I found it funny that the police boss was a bull as we call them like that here in Germany. It would be for American audiences as if he had been a pig, but I guess they did not want to go there in order to avoid criticism from the police force. Oh yeah, the Shakira song was pretty catchy too. This is the best animated film from 2016 I have seen so far and I would watch a sequel. Lets see how long it can stay on top, possibly until the very end? I recommend "Zootopia". Go check it out. The sloth alone is worth seeing it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best in the TTT era of Disney</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Long ago, that is long ago in movie making calendars, in the year 2007, they made a lovely witty film in the Disney Studios. It was called Enchanted, and it had a brand new concept at its base. It had the normal Disney conventions turned upside-down. It was fresh and charming and it gave the entire Disney universe a brand new attitude. I really loved it, I still find Enchanted to be one of the best ever made by the studios. But than, somebody important fell in love with this novel approach to the world, they also realized they could now remake every film the ever made with this new attitude, that meant a whole lot of new scripts written with the same twist in the plot and the TTT era was born. TTT - namely Turned Tables Trend. Thus came into the world The Princess and the Frog, Frozen, Tangled, Alice in Wonderland and many more. Many of these were real nice movies, but they all have the idea of retelling the story in a new, more modern way. Where, neither good nor evil will be exactly what we thought it would be. Like all ideas, it wasn't good or bad as is, it was a new idea - for the Disney Studios, it meant, in a manner of speaking that they did arrive into our modern world. But sometimes it became all consuming. That's how bad movies such as Maleficent and Into the Woods were born, when the idea of twisting the plot became everything and nothing else was important.Now all that was mostly about the history of recent cinema, but I'm both a history buff and a cinema buff, so I do apologize for the digression. All I wanted to say, that for me, this is the best movie made by Disney since that trend took over. It's the best because while this concept is still there, it doesn't control the movie - the story does. It does mean that the end is not so very unpredictable, but I don't mind that all that much. It's a very good story, great voice acting, wonderful jokes. I just love it. But please Disney - try something new, every now and again, how about something old fashion just for the novelty of the idea.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Boring with a lot of political undertones.Shocked to see the ratings.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't generally review movies but, i HAD to do this. I'm a huge fan of Disney since my childhood so it is very disappointing to see films like this from them.I still don't know how this movie got such good ratings and reviews. This is the FIRST Disney movie that actually bored me. Honestly it was very slow, dull, humorless that i don't remember even smiling once. In the past Disney movies used to be about wonder, laughter, joy and beautiful emotions aimed at kids. ( Lion King, Tarzan, Toy story, Jungle Book etc). Now its very sad and disturbing to see Disney movies filled with leftist political undertones and propaganda aimed at kids( I'm no right winger) While the makers of the film claim its about breaking stereotypes and tolerance this movie actually REINFORCES stereotyping and intolerance. Its very annoying and disgruntling to see this in a film for kids. This movie GROSSLY stereotypes and humiliates Americans from the South and religious people while claiming to be a tolerant film. Funny that tolerance works both ways. It has an unnecessary amount of leftist, liberal propaganda and political undertones. If this continues and Disney keeps these kind of films, i would never watch their films again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>fun with nice message</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The animals have evolved and live together. Judy Hopps (Ginnifer Goodwin) wants to be a policeman rather than a carrot farmer like every other rabbit. She becomes the first rabbit police officer in the metropolitan city of Zootopia. Chief Bogo dismisses the rookie and makes her a meter maid. She encounters hustler fox Nick Wilde (Jason Bateman). A few predator animals have gone missing and Judy jumps on the case of a missing otter. With no support from the police force, she coerces Nick to help.This world is wonderful. I love the various climates in the city and the different sizes of animals coexisting. The central message of trying is nice. The sloths at the DMV are hilarious. When the predators get shunned, the movie takes it to another level. The fear and message of tolerance is compelling and very timely. The characters are fun and the story is engaging. There is very little to complain about. The best I can do is that the song isn't quite as catchy as "Let It Go". The final reveal is obvious for the experienced. These are really minor and the movie is great.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>At this point I've only seen 7 or 8 films from 2016, so it's no surprise here that Zootopia moves into the #2 spot behind Deadpool.It should stay in the top 10 till next spring when I round-out the list by finishing about 100 films. It's solid.Kids should stay entertained with the animation and the animals, but most of the humor is really adult humor. For that reason, it may be just about the best Disney/pixar animated film for adults in terms of the humor. THere are no lulls in that aspect. You will laugh early and often. Credit the writers.The plot is a bit thin, but very few animated films have complex/truly-original plots.Worth owning. This redbox sat on the shelf for way too long, but after finding the time, I don't feel bad about dropping 13-15 bucks on it. Still, should have just bought it.recommended. 81/100 Personally, I enjoyed-it more than Frozen, or some other higher profile animated films over the last few years, but that's perhaps due to the lack of music and the increase of adult humor.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Try everything (but differently). So Disney has done it again.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This beautiful animation came to exist because of coming together of the directors of 'Tangled' and 'Wreck-it-Ralp'. It is Disney who had once again done it, since their rival Pixer is going down in a rapid speed. As a Disney fan since my childhood, I'm very happy for their success in live-shot films and animations, especially for this one.Okay, since the revolution of 3D animation over 20 years ago after overthrowing the 2D animation, most of the big productions like Disney, Pixer and Dreamworks with few others never failed to deliver. Believe me, I was not interested in this film when I first saw the teaser and trailer. But they have done great promotions and so the film did awesomely at screens worldwide. I was totally blown away after seeing it, Disney's another unique universal charactered story. From the little children to the grown ups, everybody definitely going to enjoy it.All kinds of animals coming together happens only in cinemas, and that too mostly in animations. But todays kids are very sharp who ask lots of questions, so they had a fine explanation for the doubts regarding putting animals in a same society. It was like the United States, where everyone came from different continents and represents different race. And so in this film every animal came from different land to live together peacefully in a city called Zootopia.So the story begins when Judy the rabbit follows her dream to become a police officer in Zootopia. There she meets Nick the fox, who are actually arch-rival species in the wild, but it was thousands of years ago before adapting the civilisation. So trust is what not promised between them, but they're forced to work together after a small missing person case becomes their prime agenda. Solving the mystery is what brings the end to this wonderful tale.These days animations are not just concentrated on comedies, trying to get us emotionally as well. Maybe that's how they're grabbing the adult audience, especially the families. Shakira's cameo was the highlight, and her song 'Try Everything' helped the get attention from all the corners.The Oscars was concluded just a couple of months ago, but it already feels like the fever is gripping again for the next edition and looks like this film is leading the way for the animation category. I know it's too early, but I hope it wins it. And finally a request for the Disney, bring it on a sequel as soon as possible.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Emotional Anti-Prejudice Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Using animals as an allegory for social injustice is nothing new, as the concept had previously been employed by Animal Farm and Maus (among others), but Zootopia is a balancing act. It's comedic, dramatic, colorful, well-written, and fun for the whole family.The first thing worth noting is the animation. I have never seen animated fur this look this real. The detail on the length and texture of each hair is remarkable and makes the characters look absolutely adorable. The environments were designed to accommodate all the different animal sizes in creative ways, and Zootopia itself is divided into several different climates (like arctic and rainforest) so there's a good variety of backgrounds for the characters to interact with.And speaking of characters, the way the film's two lead characters play off each other creates a lot of humorous moments, and a lot of the supporting characters have unique personalities and intentions that are not always clear. The "predator" and "prey" animals play a big part in establishing the prejudice that some characters have toward one another. It's kind of like Crash, but with animals, and far more enjoyable.As with most Disney films, there are some very emotional scenes that involve family, trust, and friendship. All of them are brought to life by excellent voice acting from an all-star cast, some of which sound like they were practically born to play their parts. This might be one of the best films I have ever seen, combining action and drama with beautiful animation and well-written humor. There isn't much to complain about, because I can't think of anything to complain about. It really is that perfect.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I first started seeing the trailers for this movie I knew it was going to be good. However, nothing could have possibly prepared me for how much more there was to this movie than I first believed, and I'm being one-hundred percent honest when I say the results blew my mind! What I believed was going to be an animated comedy about anthropomorphic animals turned out to be a heartfelt journey of friendship development and the understanding of differences that brings us closer rather than divides us. I'm also really impressed with how much research actually went into this project. Honestly I don't know any other film company that would do this much research for a one hour and forty-eight minute film. It's absolutely brilliant. On top of all that the animation was astounding. Never before did I believe any movie was worth a full score, however, Zootopia earned it. Congratulations Disney. You've won my heart again!</fullReview>

Although Disney has expressed stereotypes (ex: foxes are wily, lions are kings) a lot of times in most Disney movies, this movie shed light on such prejudice or discrimination. Prejudice in this movies can be compared to racial discrimination in real world. Bunny cop and a buddy fox overcome such a prejudice and discrimination as well as incidents. I wonder who becomes hopps (the bunny cop) in real world.If this movie was not an animation, it brought us gloomy and depressed impression in the end.All the Disney movies, especially recent ones make us consider social problems.

		<fullReview>Zootopia I can already tell is destined to become a classic. Of course the idea of portraying racism without actually using race is nothing new. But this is one of the first films to do it, aimed at children. In a world populated by anthropomorphic animals, Judy Hopps (Ginnifer Goodwin) a young bunny from rural Bunnyburrow, fulfills her dream of being a police officer in the big city of Zootopia. Unfortunately the commissioner Chief Bogo (Idris Elba), doubts her abilities and assigns her to traffic duty. While there, she meets a conman fox named Nick Wilde (Jason Bateman). When Bogo reluctantly let's Judy handle a missing mammal case to look for Emmett Otterton, she and Nick become unwitting partners and friends. Along the way our two heroes are subjected to animal inequality and stereotypes, which near the end becomes a big part of the story. I won't go into all the details bit overall I thought it was a great film, with great characters, and a creative world. If you haven't seen it yet, you should.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Both Fun and Funny, but also Very Predictable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Zootopia is about a city in which all animals live together in organized society, and follows a rabbit who, after becoming a police officer, begins to chase after a criminal who is believed to have kidnapped multiple other animals. The plot isn't really all that unique. In actuality, it's just another crime movie, only with animals instead of humans. Now that's not to say that the animal factor is never used. There are plenty of times when the characters act like animals which helps influence parts of the movie, but it tends to be primarily used for humor. Otherwise the movie is presented in such a way where you aren't really thinking about how predictable it is, but it is still extremely predictable. There are a handful of parts in the movie, especially one part towards the end involving a conflict between two characters, that feel really forced, and don't fit in with the rest of the movie, even if the whole thing already is predictable. At least it was predictable and reasonable, but at the end there was just no reason for it. The characters are interesting enough. They have their distinct character traits, and they still feel relatable and real enough, despite being animals. They seem like they have more to them than just their specific traits, but otherwise not a whole lot to mention here. The movie is surprisingly very funny. Now I knew that this movie would be funny, of course, most comedies are, but I was surprised at how often I found myself laughing at this movie. The movie touches on a handful of bigger topics, as I'm sure you've heard, but it just touches on them. It doesn't always go too far into them, and I think that if they handled these topics a little differently that maybe I would have enjoyed it more. Overall Zootopia is good. It's very funny, lots of fun, but unfortunately struggles with being predictable and a little forced at times. I'll probably see this movie again, and I'll definitely buy it if I find it for a good price. In the end I would recommend this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best animated Disney film since Toy Story 3</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Zootopia is a great family-friendly, animated film. It has really good adult humor and is fun to watch from start to finish. The animation is really good, too. The idea of a movie where animals live and act like humans in an earth-like world is a great idea. Sometimes really good ideas for movies are just good ideas and don't really do that well on the big screen. Inside Out, for example, is a great idea for an animated movie, but, in my opinion, it didn't actually deliver. This is not the case for Zootopia. You will find yourself laughing out loud many times throughout. It's a very fun movie, and you should definitely check it out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You certainly don't need to be a kid to love this movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A staple of children's movies is to give animals human characteristics, whether it is our feathered friends in the "Rio" series or our furry friends in the "Alvin And The Chipmunks" franchise. What is different about "Zootropolis" - called "Zootopia" in the USA - is that this is not one breed of talking animals existing in a human world, but every breed of animal inhabiting a world in which there are no humans. The colourful representation of this world, the engaging variety of characters, and the clever script with a message of tolerance and inclusion make for a wonderful movie from Walt Disney Productions.The basic story is a kind of "Lethal Weapon" pairing of two unlikely partners in crime- fighting: a female rabbit called Judy Hopps (voiced by Ginnifer Goodwin) and a shady fox called Nick Wilde (Jason Bateman). In pursuit of a missing person (sorry, animal), they encounter all sorts of adventures and a cast of characters ranging from sloths who will not be hurried to a Mr Big who turns out to be a tiny version of "The Godfather" concluding with a singing gazelle (Shakira). I took my five year old granddaughter to see the movie and she loved it, finishing up dancing in the aisles.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My review of the refreshing animated film Zootopia</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In my opinion Zootopia is one of the best children animations since Rango as it attempts to tell a competent and interesting story instead of just projecting ideas and messages with only leaving stereotypical characters and thin story arcs left. Zootopia focuses on its two main leads, Judy Hopps and Nick Wilde and fleshes out their characters and why they are the way they are.Their relationship is well-realised except for one aspect that is a "spoiler" but it happens in so many movie's that you'll know it's coming. The twists aren't nearly as predictable then in other Disney films which is refreshing and the story overall is very investing and is able to have a message about racism without it feeling shoe-horned in. In terms of animation it is nice in it's simplicity like Judy's apartment and the way the action sequences are filmed are full of energy and are all throughout the film. Some wide- shots of the city are unexceptional but the rain forest and polar setting within the film looked excellent and water in CG animation is simply now perfected. The humour lands about 80% of the time with only some jokes being meh. The movie is clever in reflecting real-life and how the way something is in real-life can be covered in a sheen through publicity and an emphasis on that through advertisement. The film's messages are clever and well- thought out and while obviously there aren't in your face about it. The film is not flawless though. There are about 5 lulls in the story that affect the pacing, dialogue sequences between the two main leads should have been a lot snappier (which ironically enough most of them took place straight after the Sloth sequence). Towards the latter half of the film plot conveniences show up and aspects are pretty dumbed down. And lastly, the song that was shoe-horned which is extremely mediocre but awful compared to most other Disney songs made for an awkward feeling in it's badness. Overall Zootopia is a great animated children's film and a pretty good movie on it's own. It's flaws deter it quite a bit but with every scene either having humour, fantastically directed and animated action, great character development and sometimes even scares Zootopia's quite large amount of flaws are outweighed by it's consistency to entertain and just be an investing film. There are some modern animated films from the 2010s that technically are on the same level as this film but the attempt to do something different and it's succession is why I like it a little bit more but it's too heavy on slow moments and it is quite flawed so this is why I'm giving Zootopia my "GOOD" rating-6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The jewel of Disney's 'second renaissance'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As someone who has been an enormous Disney fan all my life (the only films that don't do much for me are 'Chicken Little', 'Home on the Range' and 'The Black Cauldron', if it counts also 'Planes'), Zootropolis may not be as good as the best of classic Disney or the 'big four' of the Renaissance era.However, it is for me the jewel of Disney's 'second renaissance' (their return to form era starting with 'The Princess and the Frog', and if it counts -might not as it is Disney Toon Studios- their only misfire from that era is 'Planes'). Despite a couple of issues 'The Princess and the Frog' was still enormously entertaining. 'Tangled was Disney's best since 'The Hunchback of Notre Dame' (not sure how much of a popular opinion that is though), until the even better 'Wreck it Ralph' took that title. 'Winnie the Pooh' was immensely charming and sweet with its one problem being that it was too short. 'Frozen' despite what people say to me was the best animated film of 2013 besides 'Ernest et Celestine' (and the amount of hate it gets and the detractors' attitude towards those who loved, or even liked, the film has been blown way out of proportion). And 'Big Hero 6' was fun and touching with one of Disney's most endearing characters in recent years in Baymax.Onto the review properly for 'Zootropolis' now. The animation is fantastic with rich colours, vivid, beautifully designed and colourful backgrounds and lovingly designed characters whose movements flow fluidly and never robotically. Some of it is even very inventive and imaginative in the set pieces. Michael Giacchino's score is cleverly orchestrated, energetic and catchy, not as good as his scores for the ones for the Pixar films 'Up' and 'Inside Out' but it complements 'Zootropolis' very well indeed.'Zootropolis' has some very smart and hilarious writing, cleverly balancing sly references, witty humour and also genuine pathos and heart with few if any awkward tonal shifts. The visual gags are similarly inventive and a joy to watch. The story is so consistently well paced and involving and is told with such energy, charm and heart that some may forget the storyline being predictable. To me, it had enough originality to not make it matter that much. What was also impressive about 'Zootropolis' was how it dealt with such heavy and wholly relevant themes and issues, one of most daring along with 'The Hunchback of Notre Dame' and deal with it with a light touch. Some did find the message (one that's easy to identify with) forced and heavy-handed, it wasn't an issue to me at all, to this viewer it was incorporated well and respectfully.The characters in 'Zootropolis' are interesting - all serving a point to the story- with colourful personalities, none of them felt bland, none felt shoe-horned in, none felt annoying and none felt unnecessary. Love the sassiness and charm of the protagonist, and while the twist wasn't a surprise as such the villain did serve a good threat and more interesting than the recent Disney twist villains. The voice acting is just terrific from all, especially from Ginnifer Goodwin and Jason Bateman. Can't go wrong with Idris Elba, JK Simmons and Maurice LaMarche either.All in all, with the one small exception of the forgettable and slightly grating main song from Shakira (which was not enough to bring the film down personally) 'Zootropolis' was a superb film, not only of Disney's post-2009 films but also one of their best post-Tarzan and towards the top end in the Disney animated film ranking. 10/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Perfect Film for A Better World | Review of 'Zootopia'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a great family film that everyone needs to watch because of all the teaching moments within the film. Let me phrase that: the entire movie is a teaching moment. Zootopia is a film that is all about inclusion, about putting away the stereotypes and prejudices aside to live in a better society and how negative they are, how much they blind someone to see something but hatred and anger.The story is just amazing as it follows Judy Hopps (voiced by Ginnifer Goodwin) a small town bunny who wants to be a part of the big leagues as an officer with all the other large big animals that work together to solve crime in the big city. But she's a bunny, what the heck can a bunny do as a crime? It's a stereotype the resonates so strongly with the audience, with anyone who was thought of as being too weak to do what the "big boys" do. Judy is breaking those barriers, breaking those stereotypes to show that even though she may be tiny, she can do their job twice as good as they can. And boy, does she do it. She is suck a great character and the film has so much heart to it because of who she is and how she develops in the film. She's so single minded on her quest to do something right, to prove herself, that she becomes lost within the prejudices that now surpass the. It's a growing moment for her and the audience because they see her mistakes and they see her fix them.As for Nick (voiced by Jason Bateman), he faces many of the same challenges as Judy, but his are based more on the prejudices of a fox. He's a predator, and no one gives him the chance to be anything more than that, so he stopped trying. This is something everyone faced in their life, bullies to geeks, jocks and cheerleaders; society has a way of bunching the few alongside with the few bad apples. Nick represents that side of society that many people don't realize is even there because it is just part of how culture tends to work. And the fact that this film is addressing that makes is such a profound film.This movie should be applauded on the story itself, because these writers and the directors, together they were able to create this very time- appropriate story that has a very powerful theme to it. It is simply such an amazing story about inclusion that doesn't play nice. This is may a kids movie, but that did not stop the writers from adding in some very dramatic scenes to highlight the negativity that comes from watching life through stereotypes and prejudices, how dangerous and hurtful they can be to an individual. It's all about not to judge the book by its cover.Story and amazing voice acting aside, A movie filled with heart, laughs, and plenty of teaching moments for a better society is amazing, and to make it even more amazing were the graphics of the film. Animated movies just get better and better, and Disney works amazingly with their graphics putting so much work into it, they deserve the recognition for their hard work. Everyone deserves something for this film because all together, this film was just an amazing piece of animation that had such a strong story. This is the perfect family film and is the perfect film for everyone of any age, gender, or race because of what it teaches: inclusion.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Zootropolis is a well-crafted Disney tale, with a simple moral message about not stereotyping other people. It's a really good movie.The main character Judy Hopps, a police bunny, and her side-kick, a fox called Nick Wilde, live in a world where animals (well, mammals anyway) have evolved and become civilised. These two main characters are probably not Disney's most memorable creations, but they do a decent job at the heart of the movie.What's really good about Zootropolis is the huge supporting cast - there are some fantastic characters among them. The two that stuck out for me were Flash, the sloth, who is helpful but painfully slow, and Mr. Big, a shrew who turns out to be a mafia godfather. There are many many others.Disney also do a great job with the landscapes and cityscapes that make up Zootropolis. There's loads of detail and it all looks fabulous. It all makes for a full and diverse imaginary world that is easy to get lost in for an hour and forty minutes with the family. A real treat.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Slick, funny and at times rather clever, Zootopia is the kind of animated movie even the most miserable curmudgeon would have a hard time hating: it looks bright and pleasant, features likable characters and manages to sneak a few complex messages about prejudice and civil societies into a neat piece of family entertainment.A rookie cop bunny (voice by Ginnifer Goodwin) and a con artist fox (voice by Jason Bateman) pair up to crack a case of mysterious disappearances and predators gone wild in the animal-inhabited city of Zootopia. Film noir and buddy movie tropes get an affectionate parodic twist: the water buffalo chief wants results, an arctic shrew is a crime boss, the DMV is managed by sloths, and so on.Special praise because, in a cinematic age of excess and useless padding, the film is well-paced and runs at a brisk (for today's standard) 105 minutes - it leaves you wanting more, instead of hoping it will finally end.Unsurprising, and for once deserved, box office triumph.8/10</fullReview>

We were all entertained, the entire family had been looking forward to this and we wasn't disappointed at all.You can see this just for the animation, that is really awesome and beautiful, it is also very rich both in color, but also in realism and diversity, the world of Zootropolis and it's different areas are really one great spectacle to watch.You can also see it for the characters, really just a lot of different representatives from vast areas of the animal kingdom, the main ones would maybe not be the obvious choice (a rabbit and a fox), but they meet so many others and it is a great experience to watch the diversity. There are so many characters to love in this, from our main characters Judy Hops and Nick Wilde, to Flash the funniest sloth I have ever seen, but there are so many other lovable characters.You could also see it for the story and the subject, it really is a great one, it has it all and my kids got as much out of it as I did, it really speaks to your senses and emotions, maybe a bit subliminal, but if you think about it again and again something got to give.Maybe see it for all of the above, it is an enjoyable animation all the way and with all it entails, just watch it and be entertained, you should be on several levels.Location, seating &amp; time: Bio City, Nordisk Film, Taastrup, Denmark - Bio 1, row 9 seat 1, 2, 3, 4 &amp; 5 - 17.02.2016 at 10.00</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A pretty important movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'ZOOTOPIA': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)The 55th feature film from Walt Disney Animation Studios. This one revolves around a world of anthropomorphic animals; where a cop bunny teams with a con artist fox, to solve a missing animal case. It was directed by Byron Howard and Rich Moore, and co-directed by Jared Bush (the trio also co-wrote the movie, with 5 other writers). The film stars the voice talents of Ginnifer Goodwin, Jason Bateman, Idris Elba, J.K. Simmons, Jenny Slate, Nate Torrence, Octavia Spencer and Tommy Chong. It's received nearly unanimous rave reviews from critics, and I have to agree; it's one of the best films of the year (so far)!Judy Hopps (Goodwin) had always dreamed of becoming the first rabbit police officer (since childhood). When her dreams finally come true, she's assigned to work at the Zootopia police department. Zootopia is a large metropolis; of all kinds of different mammals. Judy is (of course) initially met with a lot of skepticism (and prejudice). She tries to prove herself, by solving a missing otter case. She teams up with a clever con artist fox, named Nick Wilde (Bateman), in order to do so. The film is beautifully animated, and full of colorful (likable) characters. It's both funny and surprisingly touching; but what's most beautiful about the movie, is it's insightful message about bigotry. You can never judge anyone by their appearance, or social background, and what better way to illustrate that message to kids; than with a world full of various types of animals. I love this movie, because of that message (it's one that means a lot to me), and I don't usually love Disney animated films. This one is pretty important.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/8JsPKeI7y6U</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More layers than a rainbow cake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really wasn't in any mood for a Disney cartoon. Somehow I can always see behind the sheen of the screen and notice all the usual Disney mechanics at work. Then it happened - the word of mouth is great and I kept getting shoutouts from friends why I haven't checked it out. So we did last night and this is the second good film I have seen this year. Notice I didn't use the words "good cartoon"?The world of Zootopia is so meticulously designed with its own logic that mirrors our societies. I came out feeling that it is a world that is built on metaphors and it is a real place. The emotional beats are spot on and pitch perfect. Thematically, this is strong. Its themes of empowerment and the dangers of stereotyping so timely and so effortlessly delivered. Unlike all the other typical Disney cartoons, this latest outing is never preachy and laden with so many rapid spitfire puns. We laughed ourselves silly at so many inventive scenes and the unlikely friendship moved us. This one has more layers than a rainbow cake. The kids will probably get it at one level but you know what? Over a MacDonald's happy meal you can start opening their minds to read into the other themes. It is time to educate them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A beautifully portrayed movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Zootopia amazed me with its script. The film focuses on the life events of judy who is an underrated police officer. The story line is told in a way which keeps the audience gripped to their seats. I was especially pleased with the voice-over provided for the characters. The film also has good animation which need not be said for a Walt Disney movie. The whole concept of the movie is interesting as it tells the story of civilized animals. Walt Disney ceases to amaze us with its animation and script as this is worthy of mention. The villain didn't exactly take me by surprise though. But it is no flaw. Overall i would have no trouble watching a second part for this movie which explains my interest for it. &#x1f609;</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as "clever" as people are saying</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Another Disney movie that follows the same trend of their movies in recent times. I wouldn't call this a clever movie. The ideas they were trying to get across were so evident that the movie was almost 4D in your face. It's funny that movies like this get so much praise for such a thing, yet the same ideas are spread like crazy over social media every single day. In this movie, they go crazy about equality and then they accentuate stereotypes - that doesn't make much sense to me. (Sloths at the DMV, Moles as the mafia leaders, "Black" deep voiced little animals that are emphasized by being criminals and then playing rap music in their car).I will however admit that such messages about equality and acceptance are necessary for kids today, though. I just thought it was just too obvious and therefore too eye roll worthy for the more mature. Also what the hell do those carnivorous animals eat, since every animal is personified? Biologically, these animals living in 'harmony' is greatly flawed. This movie fell into the trap of seemingly every Disney movie these days. It starts off as funny and charming, yet around half way through the movie, all of this just ends. We get some pointless dark action scenes which 'scare' the kids into keeping them engaged, and there is nothing funny or amusing. In this period of the movie, you're lucky to even grin at all, as all of the thoughtful content has ended. At this point of the movie as usual, it's like the writers have just given up or slacked off in the details department. Then, it's just a guess as to what typical complication, climax and resolution they have decided to pick for this movie. Lately they've been going with the 'nice but secretly evil' route - as they did here. At the end of the movie, there was one thing to laugh about - however it was directly related back to one of the scenes in the first half of the movie. At least the voice acting was fantastic - as expected with every Disney movie. I personally also found it hilarious when a good portion of the film was very dark, but then they felt that they needed to bring the "children's movie" factor home by having some stupid, EXTREMELY corny concert at the end. It felt a little bit out of place. A waste of the animators' talents when they could have finished with something a bit more cohesive. Gazelle's (or Shakira's) song, was cringe-worthy. Fall Out Boy definitely did a better job with their fitting song "Immortals" in Big Hero 6. Again, the fact that this is called a clever movie is frustrating. I guess I can't expect much of reviewers though when they call Inside Out "innovative", when that whole concept was a direct rip off of "Herman's Head" and "The Numskulls" . But don't worry u guys because Inside Out is the only innovative, creative one!!!1111111111 (despite the others coming out years beforehand).&#xfeff;I would recommend this movie if you don't have anything to watch on a lazy Sunday afternoon, as there is nothing much to be overly impressed about for a good chunk of the movie as it's a plot that's been used many many times. I just wish the same charm and humour from the first half of the movie lasted throughout the whole thing. Recently, I've seen "Hotel Transylvania" 1+2 and "Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2", and would definitely recommend those over this movie as at least the charm persists throughout.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Zootopia really is pretty darn good. The actors that voice the different characters really were picked well. Jason Bateman, Ginnifer Goodwin, and shakira were great leading voices amongst others. The plot is very interesting and also teaches a very good moral lesson. The writing is very clever, funny and irresistibly entertaining. The action sequences were well done and fun to watch. The animation here is very state of the art and well done. The events that lead up to the very interesting ending are all very fun, smart, and entertaining. This movie keeps your undivided attention, that's for sure. The lesson this film teaches and depicts is a very good message, especially for the younger crowd. Children, teenagers, and adults will all love this fun ride. Disney has done it once again. Go out and have a little fun with Zootopia! 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>overpraised, over-hyped, but still a good movie with good animation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Basic story summary badly written by me: A rabbit named Judy Hopps has dreamed her whole life of becoming a police officer in the city of Zootopia. Part of her dream of working in Zootopia is for her to live in a place where she isn't judged based on what animal she is, which is what she had experienced in her childhood on the countryside. After being excluded from a case involving missing animals at her job and assigned to parking duty instead she soon realizes that things were not quite as she imagined in the city. In her own investigation into the case of the missing animals, Judy herself starts to question if there is some legitimacy or not to whether different animals are inherently different from each other.Disney movies are good movies. It is as simple as that. Zootopis does however NOT do anything groundbreaking, and not even anything particularly new. Using animals as a way to portray differences between characters is nothing new, using animals as characters is nothing new, the humour is GOOD but nothing extraordinary, the story itself is nothing special, and the moral of the story is, again- nothing new.The movie doesn't do anything bad, the movie is overall good and fine. The characters are good and many of them pretty funny. The story is good even if it is nothing new, and it is mostly catered to children.If anything, i would say that the whole moral message about peoples equal value (or whatever) often feels a bit too forced, and that the filmmakers at times tried too hard with it.I don't really understand how this has gotten almost perfect scores from critics. There is nothing groundbreaking here, but it is a solid movie. It didn't really make a big impact on me, the only thing i would say is that the animation is really quite impressive.I imagine that kids would really like this movie, there are animals and friendship and stuff.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An amazing movie but for adults</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think kids will not see the whole beauty of this movie. It is definitely for adults.And it is amazing. It made me laugh so hard at times that I almost forgot that I am watching animation. Seriously, where are the good story-tellers and directors when you need them for a normal movie? Apparently they are all in the animation business. Well, good for us - those who prefer Disney and the other players on that field. Well done! Will recommend this to all my friends and coworkers - even some of them don't like animations. It is worth to watch and contains more creativity and soul than almost everything big screen movie that I have watched those days. And yes, I am talking about Star Wars and X-Men :)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sluggish plot that is kind of predictable, a violent detective story that was not exactly for kids, but most of all it was chock-full of multicultural leftist propaganda that will leave you thinking you just watched a govt infomercial. The entire movie was a thinly-veiled message on tolerating the more 'aggressive' members of our society (who were all more 'ethnic' animals) and learning to trust/adopt rather than deport them. I think Frozen marked the beginning of the shift toward the left that Disney will be doing for the next films. I don't think I'm going to see any more of them. Children's movies should not be tools for political messaging.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Stupidity took this movie down while the premise still had some allure as being somewhat of a modern-day "animal farm"but sadly that wasn't the case here.It is certainly not a classic because it's build to much in to today's standards and contains the same elements as a lot of today's movies like feminism,racism and sexism.Other factors that are connected to theses elements are not so much highlighted like religion or social structures within this society. It wants to preach diversity but gives a one-sided view to the story and gives all kinds of awkward messages doing so.All the focus was on the bunny and the rest of the characters seem to tag a long to make sure everyone is better in the end by meeting her because she is such an inspiration.It reminded me a little of the 'Rey"character in" the forge awakens"but than to a lesser extent.A "close to Mary Sue" character basically.I wanted more entertainment out this and also a story that served all the people and not the few "hot topics"that are only important for a couple of years.I think that with the passing of time the movie will loose momentumand that it is not the timeless piece that people said it was.The Shakira song was terrible and did not fit the movie at all and the animation was "acceptable".I had a few laughs but not nearly as many as i get from watching a 20 minute episode of Southpark.I was disappointed by it but by looking at the raving reviews realized I pretty much stand alone in this.It's not bad.....just blatant PC.Nice bunny,but no bugs!Fox this!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Saw it yesterday with a friend of mine....I'm 58, she's 64.....we loved it! However, I can see that much of the dialogue of this movie would go straight over the heads of younger children. A friend of mine took her 5 yr. old grandson to see it and he was bored so they left early. As an adult, I found it very entertaining to see references to The Godfather and Breaking Bad, but most children wouldn't grasp it! The dialogue reminded me of how the Bugs Bunny cartoons used to be....loved it as a kid but realized all the satire later as an adult!This movie was very beautiful visually. Loved all the bright colors. I also enjoyed trying to figure out who the character voices were as I hadn't checked prior to seeing it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A cute female rabbit becomes a police officer and is instantly the best officer the world has ever seen - surpassing all of her dumb male co- workers who belittle her for being just a cute dumb bunny. The film then descends into a commentary on racial issues as the rabbit says that a bunch of predators may be attacking people as "its in their DNA" and the media and politicians whip up mass hysteria to control the people (ok, that part is pretty valid). The rabbit then learns her lesson about how it's wrong to call out dangerous criminals if they're all from the same race, and that it was really the government manipulating the predators into being evil.The sloths were pretty funny, though.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A lower-rung Disney effort.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bright, bubbly, breakneck: all defining characteristics of Disney's latest animated adventure. Sanctimonious, serious, seldom funny: other key traits that suffocate this family film until there's very little left to enjoy. With multiple ecosystems and a plethora of cultural subsets ? mirroring our own society wouldn't you know ? the anthropomorphic animal-world is conceptually interesting and beautifully animated, but the story told within this universe is disappointingly dull. The simple predators-and-prey-living-together plot device should've been ripe for subtle metaphors amongst zippy action and constant laughs, yet the film's themes ? breaking down stereotypes, looking past race, being inclusive ? are hammered home so heavy-handedly it feels like you're getting in trouble. A major issue is the lack of humour (or more accurately: successful humour) which, save for a truly hilarious sloth-centred sequence that had me in tears, is woefully misjudged and/or drowned out by the persistence of shoving a point down our throat. The muddled tone makes for a confusing viewing too; the unapologetic innocent nature of proceedings suggests this is aimed squarely at the toddler demographic, yet the Godfather and 'Breaking Bad' references are directly at odds with this. The infectiously optimistic bunny at the movie's heart, Judy Hopps (Ginnifer Goodwin), is a sweet and likable protagonist, however the mischievous fox who partners with Hopps, Nick Wilde (Jason Bateman), has more depth and charisma. A lower-rung Disney effort with a gratingly obvious agenda, Zootopia hints at brilliance but frustratingly falls way short.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>May Just Be the Best Disney Movie Ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To put it in the most succinct way possible, Zootopia is an absolute marvel both in scale and in execution. Disney's 55th animated film may honestly be it's best. I realize this sounds like hyperbole but I cannot lie, Zootopia may frankly be the most complete, organic, emotionally resonant, socially relevant, incredibly funny film to ever come out of Disney aka the studio that has pretty much monopolized on our entertainment.If ever there was a textbook definition of an upstart it would be Judy Hopps (Goodwin). Undaunted by the discouragement around her, Judy dreams of becoming a police officer in Zootopia, the city where predator and prey live in harmony. It's easier said than done, in fact not one of her species, nor any species smaller than a wolf, has ever made it through the Police Academy. She however finds a way and achieves her dream...only to become a meter maid. As she struggles to become an asset to the force, trouble brews in the city as predators start to disappear. Judy has a hunch concerning one of the predators and recruits the unwilling Nick Wilde (Bateman) a fox with a knack for getting into trouble.One of the first things I immediately noticed about this film coming in was the humor, which while certainly filled with corny animal jokes, is organic to the characters and the situations. There are no unnecessary and useless comic-relief characters or smug jabs meant to up the snark-factor. In-fact some of the humor is so subtle yet brilliant that it kind of washes over you. Take for example Judy's neighbors, two male bushbucks which immediately inform her they're loud and are heard sparring in their apartment. This joke will go far over the heads of children and adults alike but it's still there in the details.There's also detail in the complex relationships between the characters. Predator and prey are said to get along in Zootopia but Judy slowly realizes that that bond can easily be disrupted. Predators are a minority in the city generalized as aggressive and in the case of foxes, sneaky. There is certainly a subtext here and Disney has no problem with mirroring contemporary notions of racism and sexism and intertwining it's themes with the narrative of the story. In any other story a rabbit and a fox would be mortal enemies but in this case Judy and Nick become fast friends as they solve a convoluted crime.There are many moments I found myself rolling on the floor with laughter while simultaneously in awe at the mosaic the dream-makers at Disney have created. Any other year, a movie of this kind would have been a high-watermark of entertainment yet in the era of #blacklivesmatter and unabated police brutality, Zootopia has reached new heights. Zootopia has latched onto the zeitgeist of modern America like few movies ever have. To my recollection, only Spider-Man (2002) has achieved a similar balance between light and airy entertainment and seizing the moment to become something more. Just replace the uncertainty of post-9/11 America with the uncertainty of post- Ferguson America and you got the perfect movie for the times. One that is equal amounts of hope and optimism.I love this movie. It's beautifully rendered, smartly executed, and shockingly timely. The vocal cast is unparalleled with Goodwin and Bateman providing the best performances in an animated movie since Craig T. Nelson and Holly Hunter in The Incredibles (2004). Disney is world renowned for it's ability to give quality family entertainment and do so with a stunning sense of grace. Zootopia only continues that trend and does so while resonating with audiences in a manner few films dare to. Watch Zootopia with the entire family then, on your day off, watch it again; it's that good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I expect a lot more from Disney now</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Walking into the theatre, I expected to at least be entertained by Disney's 55th animated movie, after the crazy streak that is Tangled, Wreck-It Ralph, Big Hero 6 and Inside Out. Thank you Disney, for taking my expectations, crushing them so hard and renewing my faith that Disney is still steadily improving. (However, I am likely to be disappointed after this movie, just goes to show how much this movie elevated my expectations. It's that good, to me at least).Why do I like this movie so much? That is because within its entertaining buddy cop facade, it shows a lot more and has a lot of relevant messages to tell. It unfolds at an engaging pace and will manage to surprise viewers.Protagonist Judy Hopps (voiced by the bubbly Ginnifer Goodwin) has big dreams and wants to prove the world wrong - that a tiny bunny can take on the big mammal job of a police officer. This is certainly something that connects well with the audience. She wants to break the small-animals-can't-do-tough-mammal-job stereotype. Ironically, she is eventually roped into a battle with her own subconscious stereotypes of others. Meanwhile, you have the flip side in Nick Wilde (voiced by Jason Bateman, who has no problem playing an animated version of himself), who succumbs to his stereotype. What seemed to be a message that "you can be anything" slowly turns into a (surprisingly) timely lesson on tolerance in diversity, discrimination and racial politics. The two lead characters Judy and Nick, have great chemistry and you'll find yourself rooting for them throughout (some even want more chemistry *ahem*. A lot more). Chief Bogo (voiced by Idris Elba) and Ben Clawhauser (voiced by Nate Torrence) were nice additions to the cast, though the lack of focus on them is understandable. J.K. Simmons and Jenny Slate also lends their unique voices to Mayor Lionheart and Asst Mayor Bellweather, both of which are remarkably well-suited. To make it more fun, the movie is also riddled with references (both in pop culture and biological), hidden jokes and easter eggs. However, adults will probably have a lot more fun with these as they cater to the older audiences, like with the Godfather reference. Last but not least, the animation is beautiful. Everything, from characters to architecture to effects, looks spot on.All in all, this movie was awesome. It is guaranteed fun for the whole family (though kids might be a little scared at certain points). I enjoyed it thoroughly (maybe even felt close to crying) and I certainly would like to see more, sequels or series, just please keep the voice actors. Kudos to Disney once again.*Fair warning though, be careful with Google*10/10</fullReview>

(Remember Jody Foster getting semen thrown at her) My children cried and we left the theater when the (spoiler alert, near the end) . The movie should be rated PG13 as the themes were more suited to teenagers who could handle aggressive animals, mob mentality of killing someone, New York style hardcore sarcasm where no one cares about anyone, and Meth lab where an insane looking sheep in an DU HAST video with air breather is making "night howler" I am a guy that has seen his fair share of freaky, and I love a good movie (going for Apocalypse Now tonight) BUT this show is not for kids, and I am aghast that Disney put it out. I remember enjoying the time of Toy Story, Nemo, Hero 6, Wall-e, Up and great Disney Movies (Shrek, Shark Tale, Madagascar from the "other guys") This movie was to deep in subject matter and the message was for teenagers and not little children.</fullReview>

Now, like most of my reviews, I am going to keep it brief. I do not want to spoil this movie because, unless you have already seen it, I would say its worth seeing. This movie really changed my perspective on Disney. The film had my attention the entire time, I was never bored at any part. In fact, I was so caught into this movie, that when I went to set down my drink, I missed the cup-holder and dropped it! It did not spill but anyway, not to get off topic, it was an overall great film. This is one of the few movies that will receive a 10/10 rating.

		<shortDescription>Fast, funny, beautiful and thought-provoking</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first heard of this movie, it looked like it would just be another animal anthropomorphic buddy comedy animated movie, done in a similar fashion to Shrek, Toy Story, Ice Age or Madagascar. I was still looking forward to it after the successes of Wreck-It-Ralph, Frozen and Big Hero 6, but I did think Disney Animation Studios movie started to decline in quality, not by much mind you. So when I did see it, I was completely unprepared for the incredibly profound metaphors this movie sets out to tell and the parallels this movie makes with our own society, while still being funny, entertaining and fast paced for children. Everyone who watches this movie will touch upon the realization that this movie tackles racism, stereotypes and media fear tactics while using species (specifically predators and preys) to outline a form of class-ism. While Zootopia does not say anything that has not already been said before, it does present them in a different way. Our protagonist, Judy Hopps is a bunny, a prey, who is open minded to anyone becoming anything and a sidekick Nick Wilde is a fox, a predator, who believes that people can only be who they are, they both learn of each others limitations, difficulties growing up from the stereotypes associated to their respective species and both animals grow as individuals and as friends. These characters are very well established, as well as their enemies. The villains in the movie are brilliant because, while they were racist (or speciest), they had real motivation and you can understand why they would believe certain things would be true, when they are not. While some of the minor villains could be fleshed out more, the main villains were not racist for the sake of being racist. On a technical aspect, this movie is very well voice acted, in particular for Idris Elba, Ginnifer Goodwin, Jenny Slate and Jason Bateman. The animation is vivid and has a great blend being cartooned for style and realistic for clarity. The movie does a great job of building this world, especially when there are tiny mouses and giant giraffes occupying the same vicinity, so they took in consideration road and cars sizes as well as having certain districts for bigger and/or smaller animals. The score by Michael Giacchino is captivates you in whichever setting it displays on screen. Also if that opening scene featuring Shakira's song "Try Everything" does not pull you into the wonder of Zootopia and all of its districts, then I don't know what will.As for flaws, there are a few. There are older movie references that adults will laugh at but kids will not. So to anyone unfamiliar to those movies will not understand the humour, and sometimes will even come across as plot conveniences. Between the second and third act of the movie, our two leads will get into a skirmish which to me felt artificial and forced, but it actually helped the investigation come to an end, I understand why they needed to argue, I just don't think it was handed as well as it could. Also some animals seemed smaller than they were so supposed to be, like the mice, sheep and the elephants, and some seemed larger, like the fox and the buffalo. I'm basing this off Judy's size, because in the movie Chief Cape Buffalo Bogo is the same size as an Elephant, while Nick Wilde, a fox is twice as big as Judy, a rabbit.Those complaints really were not enough for be to dock it a mark, I was nit-picking a little too much, but I really love this movie. I think it is the best movie Disney made since at least this decade. I'm not counting Pixar movies though. I do believe this is better than movies like Wreck-It-Ralph, Frozen, Big Hero 6 etc. Judy Hopps is a great female role model for kids, children looking back at the movie when they are older will definitely catch on the metaphors they missed, and adults will probably love it more than kids, because of how relevant in our society it is. It might be this year's Inside Out and I hope it get's a Best Picture Nomination.10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Strong message against prejudice</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It has been said, among a veritable plethora of other things, that this film contains the strongest statement Disney has ever made. And there is truth to that. Disney films always have a message, a moral, but quite often it is the simplest of things. Be brave, believe in yourself, dare to dream, wish upon a star. Okay, that last one not so much nowadays, but you get the idea. But this film steps upon a soapbox. Its message loud and clear: Prejudice is wrong. Racism is wrong. Hating without reason is wrong. And in the modern world that message will hopefully carry across the nations and cultures. Because, we live in a time of fusion, in a time where all the people are starting to unite under a single banner of humanity. But it's a rocky road ahead of us and it warms my heart to see an icon such as Disney taking a stance, declaring their allegiance.And it's simply a fantastic film on its own, even if you took the message out of the equation. The characters are some of the best I've ever seen. Judy Hopps is going to be one of the great role models for the current generation of kids. The first bunny to ever serve as a police officer, she neatly straddles all the fences. All kinds of minorities and sufferers can see themselves in her. Women, people of colour, the poor, the ones from rough neighbourhoods or from the country. The film is very good in not locking its allegory into a neatly contained square. Judy struggles because she's a bunny, but what that means can be seen in vastly different lights, depending on your own point of view.And then we have Nick Wilde, a hustler fox, who's conned into working with Judy to solve a missing mammals case. Nigh perfect voice acting from Jason Bateman - as well as from Ginnifer Goodwin, who plays Judy - and one of the best duos from Disney in living memory. These two work together so well and story-wise the mystery plot moves beautifully and contains a very good hustling undertone throughout.If I had to nitpick, I'd say that I did find the villain just the slightest bit disappointing. Recent Disney films have tended to have a surprise villain, whose identity as an antagonist we learn only near the end of the film. All the reveals have been at the very least decent so far, but I do miss the so called honest bad guys, if I'm being completely honest. They simply had more charm, more menace behind them.Still, Zootopia is a great film. One of the all-time classics. Kudos, Disney, kudos.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am absolutely sure Zootopia Will Be Number 1 In All Countries Of The World Without Any Exaggeration.Walt Disney Pictures clearly delivers a useful moral of love,unity,integrity and peace of mind.since Judy is brainy and has a strong will to be a successful cop,she made a deal with a sly fox to get what she wants.When the genius and the yummy bunny Judy became a policewoman,she was so just and confident in dealing with other animals and soon she receives all the estimation from all the animals including the previously prejudiced animals who underestimated it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With the 6 weeks Summer holidays still going on in the UK,I looked at the DVD charts for a movie that a friend could enjoy with her family. Hearing (but not getting a chance to see at the cinema) a lot of praise for Zootopia,I was pleased to discover that the movie has just come out on DVD,which led to me driving down to Zootopia.The plot:Growing up in rural Bunnyburrow is told that the only job she can do is carrot selling like the rest of her family.Fighting against expectations, Judy Hopps becomes a police officer,and goes to the big city:Zootopia. Being the first rabbit in the force,Hopps is given the low job of traffic warden.Whilst handing out tickets,Hopps unintentionally helps con artist Nick Wilde,and causes commotion in the city by going after a robber. Threatened with the sack,the head of police gives Hopps just 48 hours to solve a missing persons case.Examining a photo of the missing person,Hopps spots Wilde in the background.View on the film:Deciding to make Hopps the centre of attention in the middle of production (!) the screenplay by co-writer/(along with Jared Bush/Jim Reardon/Josie Trinidad/Phil Johnston &amp; Jennifer Lee) directors Byron Howard and Rich Moore (who nods to his Simpsons past with a Godfather homage) pieces together an impressively strong,clever mystery! Keeping away from making things simplistic "for the kids" the writers craft Zootopia as a distinctive world,filled with well-meaning,heart on sleeve cops such as Hopps,and richly dodgy characters such as Wilde and the boo-hiss evil sheep. Keeping Hopps missing person case flowing with excellent twist and turns that keep the case to the top of the food chain,the writers also look at racial profiling in an intelligent, allegorical manner.Avoiding any "TV movie of the week" vibes,the writers instead trust the viewer to interpret the message,as excellent buddy Comedy dialogue makes zebra crossings over the movie. Joining Hopps in Zootopia,the writers roll out an immaculately designed world,where every corner is covered in sight gags,and the fur/facial expressions on the characters is incredibly detailed. Joined by a growing Idris Elba and a slick J.K. Simmons, Jason Bateman and Ginnifer Goodwin bring Hopps and Wilde bursting to life,via bouncing one liners off each other with a real relish,and Goodwin also tearing off Hopps "goody two-shoes" with a strong shot of sass,as Hopps puts a winning ticket on Zootopia.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Zootropolis is a Disney movie that for some reason I must have missed when it was first released at the cinema. So this review is one that has been completed after watching the 3D bluray version. Zootropolis tells the story of a Rabbit that wants to be a police officer. There has never been a police officer so part of the theme of the Movie is to not let anything hold you back despite what people say. The movie features a Fox, who it is fair to say, is treading a very thin line when it comes to the law. The story talks about the fact in the animal world there are those that are prey and those that are predators. But in this film they both live in harmony. Well they do at the start. Turns out some of the predators have gone rogue and the race is on to find out what has happened to them.There are lots of funny moments in this film especially between the rabbit and the fox, but if Frozen has taught us one thing....its that no one can be trusted. The central theme of the film is one of inclusion. That you can't trust a book by its cover and that anyone can do anything. This is definitely a family feel good film that as an adult I enjoyed.The Average Joe Film Review: 9/10 http://tajfr.blogspot.co.uk</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Zootopia is a great political piece, and its message is deep and nuanced. The animals prevent there from being any perfect parallels (intentionally) to racism, sexism, etc and exaggerates some details. The film presents both an idealized (Judy) and pessimistic (Nick) perspective. The general message it sends is our social issues are as complex as the people they involve... we are all imperfect, we all have limitations, and in the end the best we can do is try. Its a message that struck me as I hope it will strike you, and I appreciated its light-hearted delivery. It doesn't make you laugh to tears, nor will it make you cry, but it is an uplifting and moving film that I hope you will watch and enjoy!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than Frozen. Yep. I said it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Disney has had a slew of animated hits when it came to their CGI productions that were not made by Pixar. With the exception of both of the Planes movies which were...well...crap, you've got movies like Tangled (2010) and Frozen (2013), which hearkens back to the Disney Renaissance days of animated musicals, a la The Little Mermaid (1989) and Beauty and the Beast (1991). Then you've got modern takes on pop culture like the video game-inspired Wreck-it-Ralph (2012) and Big Hero 6 (2014) focusing on superheroes. 2016, however, saw the release of what I think is their best, and most original CGI-animated film to date, and it goes by the name of Zootopia (a.k.a. Zootropolis internationally).The film focuses on a small rabbit named Judy Hopps (Ginnifer Goodwin) who becomes a rookie police officer in the city of Zootopia, believing that anyone could be anything. However, this is sadly not the case, as she soon finds out with her first day on the job...as a meter maid. However, a female otter stops by the station and explains that her husband is one of 14 animal citizens that went missing, and Judy, determining to prove that she can be a valuable asset, takes on the case, with the only eyewitness to the otter's whereabouts being a fox named Nick Wilde (Jason Bateman), a known con-artist and all around smart ass that makes Officer Hopps' job more difficult than it already is.At heart, taking away the fact that it's an animated film with an all- animal cast of characters, this is a buddy cop movie in the vein of Rush Hour (1998) and Beverly Hills Cop (1984), just more family friendly. However, there's more to it than being just that alone. The movie is riddled with social commentary about tolerance and acceptance. The beginning of the film where we see Hopps as a child performing a school play about how Zootopia was formed by predators and non-predators leaving their more animal instincts behind and living together to make the world a better place puts this into motion immediately. However, the difference between this and other movies that have similar messages on the aforementioned topics is that this one does it so well that it doesn't sound like it's preaching it in your face and forcing it down your throat, and that's what makes the movie work altogether. It's well- written, and the relationship between Judy Hopps and Nick Wilde becomes more and more believable as the picture goes on.The animation is some of the best I've ever seen from the studio, as if the best aspects of their past animated productions were all present here, proving that when it comes to animated films made in the United States, Disney is still #1 in that department. In all honesty, with all of the lack of imagination coming from the motion picture industry (i.e. pointless remakes), I would love to see more movies like this coming from the big studios like Disney. Out of all the animated CGI productions from Disney this decade, this one is by far my favorite of them all, no question about it. I liked it more than Big Hero 6, Wreck- it-Ralph (which takes second place), and even Frozen. A must see for everyone of all ages.</fullReview>

Terrific writing, great voice acting and I hope this film is recognised for this and more. I will also add that seeing this at the age of 21, it does seem darker than a usual kids film but that should not be an issue and really welcomes a larger audience.

		<fullReview>I really enjoyed watching this movie. I went in with little expectation just because I wanted to watch another movie, and I was so blown away that I forgot which movie I wanted to watch in the beginning. I was constantly amazed at how flawless every aspect of a film was in Zootopia. The title, the plot which was full of explanation and foreshadowing while fun, the settings, characters, etc. It even had humor. I was not able to find a single blemish in this film. I would rate this higher than any other animated 6movies in my life. Watch this movie if you haven't already. If you have, watch it again. It has done such a great job of reflecting the human society using different types of animals. Great allegory. The beginning part of the story seems like an ordinary introduction, and yet foreshadows the events that will happen in the future. Characters are adorable. Humor was good (sloths in dmv's, and rabbits being good at multiplying were my favorites). Unexpected turn of events at times. Overall, a really well made movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Zootopia or Zootropolis is a thoughtful film about discrimination. A society where animals are divided between predators and prey with suspicion running rampant that certain animals might turn against them.In Zootopia a vast metropolis the animals live and work side by side whether prey or predator and this is the world where country bunny Judy Hopps is determined to make it in the police force as the first rabbit recruit and bustle with larger animals on the force like bulls and elephants.When she stakes her career in a missing persons case she needs the help of wily fox and hustler Nick Wilde.The trouble is rabbits have an uneasy relationship with the predatory foxes. Hopps was given fox repellent spray by her parents before she left for Zootopia.This is a bright, enjoyable colourful film with a message that you cannot judge a book by its cover. The mystery works rather well and some really nice humour undercutting the film with memorable characters such as Flash the sloth and Mr Big the underworld crime boss.The kids will lap up the detailed but breezy animation and humour, the adults will get the message even if that message might be a bit hazy if you start to think about it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Zootopia was cute, fun, and nice; I wasn't expecting much and was pleasantly surprised.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As the introduction explains, in ages past, the animal kingdom was divided into two groups, predators and prey, who constantly lived at odds. Fortunately, overtime they evolved to form a society where animals can live in harmony. A utopia...or a Zootopia. Pun aside, Zootopia is the name of the giant city in which all the animals live. In this city, so explains our protagonist bunny (Goodwin), anyone can be anything their heart desires. In the case of our heroine bunny, she dreams to become the first bunny cop (larger animals like Bulls and Elephants tend to be cops). Will she be able to follow her dream despite the adversity that will surely follow?My expectations were low for Zootopia. It looked colorful but I didn't think it had much else going for it. I was, however, mistaken. Zootopia is a really pleasant movie overall. The animation isn't merely colorful, it's fun and dynamic. The city itself is divided into different climate-based zones: you have the jungle, tundra, desert, and regular old concrete jungle section of the city. Even though you only see brief portions of Zootopia, it feels like a fleshed out world. It's fun.I'd recommend Zootopia for anybody. It was a pleasant family friendly movie. It is somewhat predictable here and there but, what do you want, it's a kids movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Zootopia offers heart, laughs, and a deep heartfelt and timely message</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just a little rant before the start of this review and it concerns the lashing of this movie as liberal propaganda. I hate propaganda as it is an underhanded way to control people no matter what side of the political spectrum it comes from and it should not be tolerated. However, how come Zootopia is considered dangerous propaganda? How is a movie that tells kids to not judge people based on who they are on the outside be considered bad? When is this message even controversial since nearly every animated film ever has the same message? Get over yourself. With that out of the way, I can safely say that Zootopia is one of Disney's best efforts in what I would consider to be the second Renaissance Era for the company with this, Frozen, Big Hero 6, and Wreck It Ralph coming out in the last few years. It teaches a very mature message about racism, classism, and just plain intolerance with a well realized world with great characters, laughs, and most importantly heart.Good: The voice acting overall is fantastic. Ginnifer Goodwin as Judy Hopps is great as she lends her voice to a strong female bunny that is likable right off the bat. Finally, this movie uses Jason Bateman's talents to good use as Nick by exploiting Bateman's way of being a cunning and slimy guy with a great deal of funny lines at his disposal. The rest of the voice cast is great with names like Idris Elba, Jenny Slate, JK Simmons, Bonnie Hunt, Alan Tudyk, and Octavia Spencer. The animation is colorful and well rendered and the world created for the film in regards to how these animals live together is very clever. As I stated earlier, the message of tolerance towards others is something that we have seen in kids films, but this movie doesn't do it in a pandering way and instead goes for a layered and more mature approach that adults can even sit back and be impressed. I also have to say that this movie also has probably the best Godfather parody I've seen in a movie in a long time.Bad: I thought the introduction of Shakira's Gazelle character was just unnecessary and served only to sell the song. It stood out for me, but it didn't ruin the movie for me.Overall, this movie is fantastic not only because it tackles its subject matter with tact, but it is just a great family film with good comedy and an inventive story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A lot of other readers focus on the be anything you want to be aspect of it, but I didn't like the subtext that we judge others unfairly. It comes off as hypocritical because essentially this movie judges "90 percent of the population", so to speak. From the protest by Gazelle to predators being violent because of their DNA, it contained undertones that people are inherently racist and if we can't apologize and grovel continually because of our racism then we are the worst people on earth and should be judged harshly because of that. So in other words, don't judge, but if you aren't a predator and don't grovel about it, your racist and therefore we can judge you.

The remaining isn't good for either one, it like a deflated balloon.For some reason, the first half of the movie managed to pass Disney censorship and rigid mentality, and offer some spicy jokes that will please adults. But what you see in the trailer, only represents the first half time.So leave your 5 years old at home, go in 'matinee' for special theater price, and leave at the 60 minutes mark with no regrets.

		<shortDescription>An animated animal film about today's social and racial issues that hits the right spots</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Imagine a world like the one we people live in, only we are all animals. And not just some animals, all animals together. Zootopia is one of Disney's films from this year and it has really become an international success. In this world of animals, a lot of them grow up into already decided places and positions. If you are a bunny, you should become a carrot farmer. Judy Hopps is exactly that kind of bunny, born and raised outside of the city of Zootopia. She decides at an early age to become something more. After graduating from the police academy as the first bunny ever to do so, she moves to the big city. She soon discovers that it is a long way to the top and not everyone in the animal world is getting along as well as she thought. She is quickly drawn into kidnappings that go higher up than anyone in Zootopia could have imagined. Great voice actors lent their voices for the film, such as Jason Bateman, Idris Elba and Ginnifer Goodwin.Firstly I got to say that I was positively surprised. Partly due to the fact that the film was awesome, but also because it really wasn't at all what I expected. Sure it is a family film but forget the standard family film formula. We are talking Swedish Beck and Wallander combined with American police films. Sometimes the film is actually scary and exciting, but most of all it is well thought out. We follow mostly Hopps and and Nick Wilde the fox, as they struggle to discover who or what's behind the mysterious kidnappings. We are even offered some plot twists and just when you thought we were getting close to the end, the film takes another turn and becomes something else. Very strong and bravely done by Disney.Zootopia's strongest points lies in the relationship between the animals. It is a "the small person against the big" film. Hopps is a small herbivore among predators that for a long time ago used to eat animals like her. Anti-racial messages and tolerance is clearly visible in the film. It does not try and hide the fact that we may all look different and have various preferences, but we are all equal and deserving of a chance in life. When you sometimes think that the film will end, the filmmakers does not hesitate to twist it one more time and deliver another punch to our heads about moral and value. Zootopia could be Disney's most political and strongest equality praising film to date. It will certainly remain for a long time in my memory because it dares to ask us these difficult questions and also to venture outside of the frames of the family film genre and sometimes become almost a thriller. Very high level of surprise and entertaining for a family film. Disney Animation Studio's best animated film in yearsDavid Lindahl - www.filmografen.se</fullReview>

I think that this is a perfect movie for the kids,you can connect to the characters very easily and the plot is very interesting. Each child can connect to different character because there are several characters with different Uniqueness. For example, Nick is easy to connect with him and his personality. Graphics simply gorgeous , The art directors did a great job with the characters ( it is also one of the reasons that children have a way to connect to the figure as a fox that usually characterized as tricky ).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Funny, moving, captivating &amp; uplifting: another Disney tour de force!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, Disney has certainly gone to school on its own successful animated movies of the last ten years or so, and "Zootopia" is a product of that and brings another astounding success in the current renaissance line of films. When I first started watching it, I thought that Judy, the cute bunny major character, had to be an awesomely endearing personage to carry the movie to the kind of success Disney is used to. And she was! The creators carefully crafted her to be a positive, upbeat, inspirational personality who could make you feel good to watch her go through her routines, then they carefully counterbalanced her with the more cynical, wily, and worldly fox, Nick, on whom she ends up having a powerful influence. They must join together to find 14 kidnapped citizens. Nick "knows everybody" while Judy maintains her powerful positive mind-set, and it is that peculiar amalgam that works well with these two characters in pursuing their job. The story outlines the injustice and silliness of racism in the many different animal characters who have various bigoted ideas about other animals, eg, predators vs prey, as was their historical background, now all equalized, supposedly, in Zootopia, where it is said "anyone can do anything" and live in a life of peace and harmony. But, as always, there are some few agents who don't agree with that system and want more for themselves, and it is that problem which Judy and Nick pursue, as both characters learn a great deal from their association.Altogether, "Zootopia" is funny, moving, and captivating, with superb art and graphics, excellent animation, while possessing a plot which is not only entertaining, but uplifting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Zootopia: "Try Everything!"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rating: 8.0, Great Movie* Disney has done it again! Zootopia may be yet another anthropomorphic kids movie, however it out stars all others as it delivers a wild dose of enjoyment and and emotional tear to every child parent and animal alike. This movie proves to Hollywood thats it's the weird and the original that succeed in the cinema in comparison to the sequels and remakes that usually fail.* Characters - Judy Hops: Ginnifer Goodwin plays a bunny more lovable than Bugs himself. She is a determined and bright character that puts a smile on every parent, child and fox, speaking of which.- Nick Wilde: Knowing Jason Bateman's previous characters, I would have never picked him to play a sly and clever fox, but he nailed it, who would have figured that a fox and a bunny would go so well together was characters?- Chief Bogo: We all know Idris Elba has the voice of intimidation, but at the same time he brought a sense of humour to the character.* Plot &amp; Design: The movie may have some confusing ideas around the city of Zootopia but boy it looks just as beautiful as Shakira's song; Try Everything sounds! But the greatest aspect of the movie is it's two messages that strive through the colour. The importance of racism are spread throughout the feature and truly shine out to the parents and the other message proving that with hard work and determination, a child can do anything with their future, no matter who puts them down!* This movie is not my Frozen (8.5) but it is my cup of tea that is refreshing and addictive. Zootopia will win the Oscar for the years best animated feature with ease and i would like to point out that this review is no where near as good as the movie it self, well done Disney you did it again!Please check out my lists and ratings at riyork2! I hope this review was a valuable source for the animals out there. I know this review lacked effort but i will deliver much better ones.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Perhaps the best non-Pixar Disney movie since the Renaissance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Months after seeing Zootopia in cinema, I'm finally ready, after much thought, to put forth my final review. Zootopia has been interpreted by so many people to have so many messages, relating to racial, religious, sexual, and even LGBT-related discrimination. In particular, it's even been said to warn against political candidates like Donald Trump (a misconception). My review will probably be like no other you've read, so here we go:General Story (separate from message): Zootopia is an example of a great story, albeit with a couple plot holes. I admire the deep, emotional writing used. In a world where almost every type of cliché story has been told, Zootopia has very little of that. The only thing cliché about it that I can think of is unfortunately it's "slogan", IMO: "Anyone can be anything". And a couple of things bother me about the story: How was Lionheart innocent? (perhaps I missed something) And what was Emmitt Otterton doing in the nudist club (seems very odd for him to be sneaking off like that). Overall, it was decent. 7/10The Characters: Zootopia offers so much depth in its characters. There are so many likable characters offered. From Judy, to Nick, to Benjamin, to Flash. As I said above, the writing is remarkable, and the histories of Judy and Nick, intriguing. Nick's discomfort, yet willingness to share bad memories with Judy provides a depth never before seen in a Disney film. The only characters I can say don't have much depth are Mayor Lionheart and Gazelle, which I can't really complain too much about, because the average politician (i.e. David Cameron) and pop musician (i.e. Shakira) aren't very personal and interesting either. 9/10Animation: The character and background animation in Zootopia is wonderful. Perhaps the best animation ever put out on CGI. 10/10Age-appropriateness: A category not commonly seen on reviews, I'm talking about how appropriate Zootopia is for all ages for what it claims to be - a Disney film expected to be perfectly appropriate for ALL ages. Zootopia is decent for kids, certainly more than The Angry Birds Movie, or Shrek, but below average for the average Disney film. The nudists, while not portrayed in a good light, may not be something some parents may be comfortable with their kids watching - simply because of the hints of the RL nudist lifestyle. As a Christian, I will state that I was disappointed at the violation of the third commandment (Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain). Also, kids will most likely have a hard time interpreting Zootopia's mature message. 6/10The Message: While it has been said to be about so many specific issues, I don't think Zootopia can be tied to any specific issue in RL right now. The connection with Donald Trump is a common misconception, as Zootopia's plot was mostly finished before most of his controversial comments were put forth (I'm not a Trumpist, I was a Cruzer, and will not be supporting Trump or Clinton in the general election). Now, for my analysis, I'd say that Zootopia is about not holding someone's race against them, and their ancestry. The closest I can think of about a RL message translation would be: don't trust your government just because they pretend to care about you. Bellweather was a believably innocent politician, pretending to care about everyone, but in the end, she was behind all of the problem. As much as the situation has been compared to the Republican Party, you, can associate it just as much with the Democratic Party. But in the end, neither are what it's talking about, so some people need to stop making a good kids movie into your political view propaganda and realize this film's genericism. The only criticism of Zootopia's message is perhaps its complexity and difficulty of interpretation. A bit too complex for an animated family film, in my opinion. Most kids won't get it. 7/10Conclusion: Zootopia is overall fun for the whole family, which provides a thought-provoking message for viewers, without any political motives and propaganda getting in the way. The characters are great and the animation is brilliant. Make sure to see it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of Disney's Best in Recent Years</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Disney hit it out of the park with this comedy mystery about a optimistic young bunny who achieves her dream of being a cop in the title city. She eventually teams up with a con artist fox to solve the city's greatest crime wave to surprising results. The film contains stellar vocal performances by Ginnifer Goodwin as Judy Hopps, the idealistic bunny cop, Jason Bateman as the duplicitous but charming fox, Nick Wilde, Idris Elba as Judy's boss and a memorable J.K. Simmons in the small role of Mayor Lionheart. The film's narrative alternates between dramatic, comedic and some gripping action sequences. The undeniable best component of "Zootopia" is the undeniable chemistry of its lead characters in Judy Hopps and Nick Wilde's unusual partnership. Initially the two are always at odds with Judy's 'by the book' attitude and Nick's trickster ways, but through their trials and tribulations the two begin to connect due to difficult moments from their pasts. Its' the proverbial animal buddy cop film.A great movie that is perfect for any age group.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Disney Movie of all Time!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was completely and utterly stunned to see the quality of the work put into this sensation film. Disney and Pixar shocked reviewers and keen movie watchers alike with this work of art. When people tuned into this movie across the world, I doubt that anyone expected an allegory relating to real life in a film supposedly for kids. The beautiful animation and the superbly written script moulded together into a perfect animated feature. Judy Hoppes, the first bunny cop, goes on an extraordinary adventure along with con-artist Nick Wilde to find various missing animals who have been shot with queer chemicals and have been thus dubbed as "Savages." Along the way, adults and politically aware children are able to notice various allegorical messages which point at/mock several flaws in our society. The movie does this very thing to the occasional slowness of governmental decisions and racism. The movie also includes the shadiness of drugs an d drug-users. They even stuff a Breaking Bad reference into the script! This movie is sensational in every way. The story and the animation are both equally incredible! However, many people have given this movie a low rating claiming that people only gave it positive reviews because "Disney made it," and because they were apparently being forced to like it due to the allegories. This is just so incorrect. If any animation studio did this, I would have been equally surprised. If a movie that was not directed at kids did this kind of feature, I would love it just as much. This beautifully written, animated and thought-out movie deserves as much praise as possible.I give this movie 9.8/10. (Rounding to 10/10)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love a Disney movie. That's why I was looking forward to this movie!The plot is interesting. One girl rabbit wants to be a police officer. But, Rabitts are small and weak. It's hard to be a police officer. She never give up. So that, she is top of her class at the police academy. She can be a police officer. But, she is appointed meter maid by her boss.I feel that a view of the world of this movie is reality. For example, every animals wear a cloth and use a smart phone! I seem to see the human world!"Anyone can be anything" this word is said by some characters. This word apply to our world. Sometimes we give up something because of our race, environment, country and so on. But, every people live in the earth have a chance to do anything!!! I'm studying abroad now. I must not give up anything. I should try to do something!!I recommend you to watch this movie. After you watch this movie, you are gave energy and courage from them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Our Differences Make Us the Same</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When you read the word Disney your thoughts are immediately filled with the joys of childhood, of an amusement park filled with wonder and more than anything of movies, mostly animated films that are cherished and loved to this day. Face it, when you watch a classic Disney feature cartoon you're taken back in time to when you first saw that movie and a smile creeps across your face. What's nice to know is that tradition carries on to this day, perhaps not in the old 2 dimensional style many of us grew up with, but that gold standard of excellence in execution coupled with great storytelling continues. ZOOTOPIA is a perfect example.ZOOTOPIA opens in a world where animals all get along, predator and prey no longer facing off against one another. Young bunny Judy Hopps dreams of becoming a police officer in a world where while the animals get along most are limited to positions deemed acceptable to their species. Determined to live her dream she joins the police academy and through hard work and determination becomes their top cadet. Place in to ZPD via a work program Mayor Lionheart has instituted she finds herself assigned?to traffic duty. She may have made the squad but her size and the expectation of a rabbit are such that she becomes a meter maid.As she performs her duties she comes across Nick Wilde, a fox con man she confronts but can't prosecute. He may frustrate her with his wiliness but their chance meeting offers her an opportunity to see the world as it is rather than how she wants it to be.A case of right place wrong time happens and Judy chases down and arrests a weasel who has stolen goods on him. Rather than a commendation the police chief, not a supporter of her being there, instead tells her she jeopardized lives and abandoned her post and demands her badge. Before she can turn it over they're interrupted by the wife of a missing person, an otter named Emmitt. One of 14 missing animals the chief begins to brush her off but Judy tells her she'll find him. As he begins to request her badge once more Mrs. Bellwether, the assistant to the mayor thanks Judy for helping. The chief strikes a deal. Find the missing otter in 48 hours or resign.Judy then sets out to find the otter, solve the missing persons problem and save the day. To help her circumvent the system that the chief has locked her out of she recruits Nick via blackmail to help her. As the pair run down a list of suspects and clues they begin to bond as well as discover a nefarious plot going on behind the scenes that is deeper than they realize.The plot may sound more adult than one would expect but it is told in the Disney style of aiming at children while making it accessible for adults as well. Pleasing both groups yields a great story told in such a way that kids will love every minute of it.But it's not just the story that makes a great Disney movie. It's the visuals first combined with that story and there is an abundance of visuals to behold her. The most breathtaking is Judy's journey into Zootopia, a city made of various land masses relating to the different animals that live there. From desserts to tundras to rain forests, all are represented in glorious and dazzling colors and visual that bring them to life before your eyes. The same holds true from start to finish in this movie that is a delight for the eyes.Not only that but there are tons of small items placed throughout the film that will have you going back to watch it more than once just to spot them all. Everything from funny references to other Disney movies to incidental items that flesh out the story and the world of Zootopia. It is this attention to detail that makes this movie a sum of all parts and worth repeated viewings.ZOOTOPIA is a movie for the entire family not just in that kids will love it but in that adults will fall in love with it as well. The central idea of different types learning to live with one another is a lesson great for kids to learn and is presented in such a way as not to be preachy but influential in an entertaining way. More than anything this film is pure Disney and that's something to be proud of. This is an add to the collection film in so many ways.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tells a great story, and puts current situations in society and drama and puts it into a kids movie. The children will understand the majority of humor, and think it's amazing. The adults will understand the Easter eggs and references, like an entire scene that resembles Breaking Bad (two sheep's name are even Walt and Jesse). The fact that they can take the current issue in society of racism and apparent "discrimination", can be shoved into a kid's movie and audiences love it, blows my mind. Don't get me wrong, it's a great movie, but it blows my mind that they were able to do this. Kids will see this as a funny animation, and adults will see this as as something else.Great story, great characters, amazing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is absolutely stunning. Saw it three times in three days and I wasn't disappointed, the story was emotional and funny, the characters were absolutely my favorite, city was enormous and beautiful. It made me almost cry near the end. Nicholas and Judy are a great combination, their voices are perfect, their fur, instincts are interesting and not dull at all. This is the greatest movie I've seen and nothing will change what I think. This movie changed the way I look at movies. And I know there will be emotionless people who will give bad reputation about the film, but I'd tell you, this film is emotional and funny, sarcastic in a good way and serious, this movie is for everyone, for young and/or old people. I would recommend this to everyone.Of course I am giving this a 10/10 because I can't get this film out of my head and I don't want to forget it because IT...IS...THE...BEST...MOVIE...SINCE...1990. And the song is URHHHH...the BEST theme song for animated movie I've ever saw.And no I am not a furry and I probably never be. As I am a member of IMDb since 2013 August and saw many movies, I know what's good and not good.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First off, something that a guy in his twenties shouldn't easily be able to say, but I'm going to say it anyway... I completely fell in love with this film. 'Zootopia' (or 'Zootropolis' for my fellow Europeans) has walked all over recent Disney productions, 'Inside Out', 'Big Hero 6', 'Frozen', etc are all fantastic films, but this smartly written animated tale, with many references made suitable for an adult audience, is just fantastic and boasts a complete sense of originality.The characters are enticing, the animation is stunning and the story is well-executed, creating a mystery-crime story within an animated world. Despite me being an adult, I still have a close connection with Disney films, as I'm sure most people do, and this is by far Disney at it's finest, a modern great!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A smart and funny film that I stand behind</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay so I have always been a huge fan of animation. There are soo many great animated films out there both that are dark and some that are really lighthearted and funny and this is no different than those. This movie works in all cylinders. This will be the most fun of any animated film I have ever watched. This jokes are smart and interesting. The dialogue is pretty compelling. And the world building her is perfect. It really does feel like our world, but it just at one point was being inhabited by animals. This movie really has a strong theme of racism going on throughout it as well and it does it in such a cool way without feeling like it is beating you over the head with its message. This movie is fun, cool and very inventive. It also leaves the door open to sequels that could deal with other things in our world. A great opening it leaves is the possibility of interracial coupling especially with our two main characters or with some side characters within this film. Sounds like a good idea for a sequel in my book. There is a lot of powerful ideas here throughout this movie and each one works soo well. Defiantly check this one out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Buddy cop movie, with 3D animated cute err... animals</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie was amusing and I watched it till the end. The problem with it is not really the film itself as it is with its genre: let's take a story that would be slightly ridiculous if we did it with real people, because it would feel lazy and hard to suspend belief, and make it 3D with cute animals, because this way one can get away with anything. And then market it to both adults and children, because it's a cartoon, but has some adult salt and pepper here and there.In short, it's a recipe movie. The animation is good, the voices are good - I mean, just look at the cast - with an appropriate huge budget. It even has heart, but painted there with such a heavy hand that I felt someone stuck down my throat a cute fluffy animal. Nothing above the ordinary yet, although I believe the standard is going to drop dramatically with each summer animated Hollywood film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Zootopia a city of anthropomorphic animals where anyone can become anything. A cute bunny Judy Hopps is determined to make the world a better place by contributing as a cop. She and a cynical con artist fox must work together to solve the mystery of missing animals.What's Good: -It's Disney. Superb animation like always. -You're gonna love all the characters of the movie for sure. -Judy Hopps never loses hope. This cute little bunny shows true determination and inspires everyone. This bunny proves that you can become whatever you want, only thing you need is determination along with hard-work. -Nick Wilde proves that nobody can be judged based upon his race, looks or company. -Flash..lol..this name suits him, he'll make you laugh even with his simple smile. -Best inspirational song of the year "Try Everything" by Gazelle (Shakira). -Kids may find mystery of missing animals very interesting.What's Not: -Story is little predictable. -Somewhere you may feel screenplay could have been better.-Repetitive gags, you'll still laugh though.Our Ratings: Story: &#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2605; 10/10 Music: &#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2605; 10/10 Direction, animation and screenplay: &#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2606; 9/10 Characters: &#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2605; 10/10 Overall: &#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2605; 10/10Final Verdict: There may be little flaws but when it comes to a Disney movie you can ignore them, it's a must watch with family, good for kids. Try Everything, track by Shakira is enough to rate it 10/10. Zootopia has everything what you look for in a Disney movie i.e love, inspiration, fun, drama and again love.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My favorite animated movie BY FAR. Loved everything from the story which even if the "animals" were already used by Disney this time they created something totally new. The music was awesome and really mashed well with the animal city setting and Shakira's "try everything" was really good and the train and concert scenes gave me goosebumps. The characters were probably my favorite thing of the movie. Every single character was fantastic , and the two leads were godlike and fit each other perfectly, Judy hoops was so cute and pure hearth but at the same time really strong willed and ready to learn and improve and Nick Wilde what can I say... Probably my favorite character EVER. It felt so real , the personality fitted so well the animal of the fox and Jason Bateman was probably the best to dub Nick Wilde , it felt like the lead character was based on Jason more than the opposite. Overall this was a fantastic experience and it left a big joy in my hearth. Will be soooooooo hard for Disney or any other company to beat that but I hope they will do it and I can't wait for it, meanwhile this movie set an incredible achievement for Walt Disney studios and really made me smile in a sad and difficult period. Thanks Disney and thanks zootopia. Just zoo it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>ZootopiaNo one has a problem with all-animal metropolises as long as citizens always remember to pick their pet human's poop up.Mind you, there aren't many squatting Caucasians in this animated-adventure.Believing you can be anything you want to be, no matter your genetic disposition, Judy (Ginnifer Goodwin) forgoes carrot farming for police work in the big city.But instead of protecting the populace, Judy's issuing parking tickets because her buffalo boss (Idris Elba) doesn't think rabbits can be cops.To prove she's more than her genus, she pairs with her species sworn enemy, a street-wise fox (Jason Bateman), to solve a rash of unsolved missing mammal cases.Ingenuously devised, strikingly rendered and wholly hilarious, this anthropomorphic whodunit has all the earmarks of classic Disney but with a modern message on diversity and tolerance.Furthermore, contrary to popular belief, the worst drivers on Zootopian roadways are not always female pandas.

		<fullReview>Pixar is booming again. John Lasseter, the producer behind Toy Story, the Incredibles, Wreck it Ralph and a long list of successful animated movies, has brought to life another cohesive story that continues the pattern of thoroughly wrapped up films.Everything from the colours, the different styles and the voice direction works in harmony so well that you will quickly be caught up in the subtleties of Zootopia. Characters are fully realized, with compelling back stories that evoke empathy from the viewer, political motives provide a layer of intrigue and inspirational events will have you dreaming one minute, and shrinking in despair the next. It is this ability to tell a story with every element of the on-screen experience that continues to set this team apart.If there is a criticism to be had, it would have to come from the unwitting power of that ability to tell a story. Considering the age of a typical animated film, Directors will often debate the value of added layers of effect; one for adults, and one for kids. For the most part, the balance is there, with some raunchy humour slipped in here and there, and some jokes that kids won't get but will have the adults doubling over when every worker at the DMV is, quite literally, a sloth. It is in the larger elements of the story that reveal its roots in classic cop films, setting itself with an uncharacteristic irresponsibility and some shock scenes that are designed to produce fear in children. These scenes would not be so effective if not for its powerful ability to convey a story.An example would be the depiction of authority figures in the film. There are no positive leaders, and no restoration in the film of those leaders. Political leaders are corrupt, parents are backwater dream-killers and bosses are narrow-minded, unapproachable, and manipulative. This is part of a significant staging of a major conflict of the character's dream, pitted against "the machine". However, the conflict is never fully resolved as "the machine" is destabilized and then restored, but never truly changed.An item of awareness for parents may come in the presentation of several classes living in Utopian harmony, represented by animals, but loaded with political and ethical undertones. To someone who shares these values, it may go unnoticed, but for people representing minority cultures or of a different ethical compass, the story lays it on pretty thick and could stimulate an interesting discussion around points of separation in the culture. For example, what makes it possible for predator and prey to live in harmony? Why are animals segregated according to size and their environment? Is it really a "Zootopian" society when everyone lives separately? This could be one of the most culturally influential movies in this decade due to its reach and appeal, and its ability to tell a story with a purpose.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the best animated movies of 2016 that I have seen so far. The movie takes you on a wild ride through the jungle to the sands of the desert all the way to the snow capped mountains. Sit back and enjoy the drama of animals taking on human roles while trying to save the city they all call home. Follow Officer Judy Hops, the Zootopia PD (ZPD) and all her wonderful companions on an adventure you will never forget.You can tell the producers took time to research the real-life quality of the animals portrayed in the movie and this makes the visual aspects even higher on the rating list. Throughout the movie, watch for small "easter eggs" or connections to other Disney movies as you will see many of these. Although there are many other Disney animated movies, I personally feel this has taken a giant leap above the others and has landed on top for a reason. Fun for all ages.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Disney's Zootopia is the kind of animated film that passes with flying colors in just about every damn category it needs to, making it a thoroughly endearing classic that will stand the test of time and delight countless new fans as time goes on. It's the best of its kind since last year's Inside Out, and one that will be hard to top this time around. It's got the most treasurable kind of story, one that has all the fun, flash and zip that the kids will take a shine to, some hilariously subversive and cheeky humour for the the adults to chuckle at, and some vital, important messages within its themes that adults will knowingly relate to, and the kids will subconsciously perceive. Never preachy nor pandering, all of its ingredients are mixed harmoniously. And let's talk about that animation, good lord. Every year these films get more cutting edge and eye boggling, and this one busts the blueprints in its attempts to dazzle, with every kind of texture, glint and rendered gold on display. Animals of all shapes and sizes run, scamper, dart and dive throughout the film, to the point where I felt that only with multiple viewings could I appreciate every loving detail and subtle joke. Ginnifer Goodwin gives perky vocals to Judy Hops, a small town bunny who dreams of being a big city cop. Just leagues away from the tiny carrot farm she was raised on lies Zootopia, a sprawling metropolis where the denizens of the animal kingdom live in civilization, or rather, their brilliantly realized version of it. She is told time and time again that she'll never become a cop, but pays no heed. And whadd'ya know, she becomes a cop. Left to rot on parking duty by stern bison Sergeant Bogo (growly Idris Elba) she fumes and longs for real action. Soon she meets wily fox and street hustler Nick Wilde (Jason Bateman in possibly the best vocal performance in years), and both are whisked away on an adventure through Zootopia to find some bad cats (and every other creature imaginable) who are up to no good. The city itself is a marvel in every sense of the word. Divided into detailed, vast and climatized zones including Tundra Town, Little Rodentia (laughed hardest at this sequence, purely inspired) and a subtropical tree house lined Rainforest area. The cast has buckets of fun, including JK Simmons as Mayor Lionheart, Bonnie Hunt and Don Lake as Judy's endearing parents, Tommy Chong as a yak hippie, Peter Mansbridge as Peter 'Moosebridge', and more. Shakira shows up essentially as herself in animal form, with an original composition called 'Try Everything' which gives the film a lot of its charm and heart. Bateman just has to be commended for a performance so full of real conflict and shades of grey its hard to believe hes playing a fox in a Disney flick. Despite being in the most hyper real of all genres, hes walked right out of real life and nails every note. There's so many highlights I could write for pages, but I won't spoil the fun, of which there's no end. There's also a very grounded head on the film's shoulders, saying some important things about not giving up on your dreams (sounds clichéd, I know, but not the way the writing addresses it here), and never assuming one thing about a specific group of animals just because of the way a few of them behave. Subversive stuff for a kids movie, and I'd have it no other way, as the undercurrents of film forge minds and opinions for the young ones. Simply put, it's destined to be a classic, and comes up a winner no matter how you look at it. Oh, and try not to bust a gut laughing at the sloth sequence, I dare you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Okay Disney, I officially forgive you for Chicken Little.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Because in terms of the setting, it's kind of like that, but good.Disney's latest CGI feature outing is beginning to make me question whether or not Deadpool is going to be the best movie I watch all year, as Zootopia is giving it a pretty good run for its money. While watching this, I was struck by all of the things it tries to do differently. Despite the fact that there are predators and prey coexisting, it feels no need to paint one side as better or worse than the other. In fact, it tries to teach that in societies with an "us" and "them" concept, that there are good and bad individuals in both groups. Among other lessons it tries to convey are that things are done for reasons other than the obvious, authority and social roles should be challenged when the need arises, respect should be earned rather than blindly given... I could go on for a while, but I'd get pretty boring and preachy.So instead, I'll leave behind my after-school special bit and explain what else works. This movie certainly knows how to reference pop culture, in that the reference is innocuous at worst for those who don't get the reference and still manages to work in context without joke behind it (as opposed to loudly declaring "Hey, this thing exists! Now those of you who know the thing, laugh in recognition!"). The characters are also very enjoyable, my personal favourite being Nick Wilde. He's slick without being oily, clever and quick with a pun, but not mean-spirited. In fact, out of the entire cast, he's probably the most level-headed and least presumptuous. Judy is also a great example of an underdog (or should I say underbunny?) who defies the odds and social norms to achieve her dreams, but she's also prone to fallacies and misconceptions, making her likable yet flawed without either feeling forced.However, there are some things about the movie that bug me a little. Why is it that only the mammals evolved to become how they are today? What about the birds, the fish and the reptiles? Why does the movie go so far to build Zootopia as a place with so many different zones, but only visit a few? And finally, why does it have the hardheaded police chief cliché? If Judy and Nick hadn't pressed him to listen to reason so hard, the movie would have had a much more grim ending. I just wish that there could be a police chief character who had more awareness than a sack of wet concrete.All in all, though, Zootopia is a great movie that's worth a watch because of its top-notch story, solid characters, superb soundtrack, and thought-provoking messages. If you like this, I'd also recommend Arashi no Yoru ni, which is very similar, minus the modernized setting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best Disney movie since The Lion King.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As expected from an animated picture of Disney's caliber, I like it a lot. The animation and the different settings they showed throughout the movie were amazing; the chemistry between Judy and Nick was interesting enough. The anthropomorphic characters are entertaining because they're relatable and the film balances the human elements with the whole "animal world" very well. I think that's where the film shines the most and hence the high reviews it's getting. Usually for Disney films (and even Pixar) they only focus on one aspect; human condition or a fantasy premise. So you can say Zootopia is sort of breaking new ground by trying to do both. The only comparison I can think of that tries to match what Zootopia is doing is Pixar's Monsters Inc.Of course, like most good Disney pictures where it can be appreciated by both kids and adults alike; but through other reasons, Zootopia's brilliance lies in the important message that the film offers. It's straight-forward since aspects of it such as the "under-dog" story is something you see in a lot of animated movies. However, I liked how the plot manages to develop beyond that into a/the bigger picture.My only criticisms about the movie is the humor might not cut through enough to people as it's mostly witty banter and subversive. Besides that, I think a film like Zootopia, it would work MUCH BETTER as a Pixar film rather than a Disney film.Pixar films like Inside Out and Wall-E manages to deal with important themes more intelligently than Disney films like Zootopia while at the same time making the film entertaining to watch as an animation. I'm not saying those 2 films are necessarily better than Zootopia; but I'm saying they (Pixar) handle the aspect of trying to get a real-life applicable point across better. Personally for me, I prefer it when the film doesn't info-dump you with stale exposition especially if it's within one scene and keep the subtext conveying subtle across the whole picture. It might sound contradictory to what my main point is compared to the end of my opening paragraph since relating to that, I know the film-makers were trying to mesh out both a dazzling and subversive animated flick but the 2nd half of the film greatly focuses on the latter aspect. So my first impression when I was watching the ending was it tried to "hammer in" too much on the human subtext and should've mix it up with the fun animated stuff like in the middle parts of the film. To sum up what I'm saying, the tone of the climax (of the film) could've been handled a bit better so that way Zootopia's themes can be addressed as a wider scope for an enhancing experience.Overall, this film is on my top 10 list of my favourite animated movies and I enjoyed the technical merits more than my own personal enjoyment of the film since the humour didn't strike me that well at times. And to be honest, the funniest scene in Zootopia was already shown in the preview trailers (which I saw prior). I still found it hilarious the second time when watching the actual movie. So maybe that's actually a compliment to the execution of the film's humour despite what I said otherwise earlier? Zootopia is quite possibly the best Disney movie of the last decade since The Lion King.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>good movie with some bad parts and "good" parts(Don't mind the spoilers tag, just put it on just in case)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am not going to talk about any of the political or racial themes in this review because i don't like bringing things like that unless it is completely about that. In the end it is just a buddy cop movie with those themes and i liked the way those themes were put in the movie but onto my review.Zooptopia is probably the best Disney animated film i have seen in a long time(probably the best since Frankenweenie) but you might be like why a 6/10? That is because i thought that the others were bad or average. Wreck it Ralph was good and is almost as well done as Zootopia(Rich Moore's skills in world building is amazing), Tangled was eh, Frozen was hokey and BH6 was complete crap. I did have some bias against this movie because I HATED BH6 but the movie turned out to be pretty good.The world building like in Wreck it Ralph is pretty amazing. Rich Moore can build a great world through visuals. i loved how each city was portrayed and how there were different things for different animals.The story is pretty formulaic and nothing great, just your standard buddy movie where two completely different people meet and have to go through an adventure together and also has a part where they get angry at each other and decide to be friends for some really stupid reason. This plot is what kept it from being really good. The jokes almost never landed and are utterly forgettable(can't even remember any after 5 minutes after i finished watching the movie) but some did stand out. The DMV one could have been great but it was in a trailer so it got ruined.The characters are pretty formulaic and like the plot made the movie worseSince it is an animated movie i should also talk about the animation. I liked the animation but it felt really inconsistent, i am not talking about the character animations(which BTW was really expressive and i loved that) but the environments. it looked cartoonish at times and photo realistic at others, just took me out of the movie but like i said, the character animations was pretty great.Gazelle was easily the worst part of the movie for me. She was there so Shakira could be in it for her latest song and more people would come and watch the movie because Shakira is like a big pop star. BTW the song wasn't even that good. It is just every other pop song and not memorable unlike the previous Disney animated movies(immortals from BH6 was great, the frozen songs weren't amazing but were catchy and i really liked that owl city song from wreck it Ralph) so that was disappointing. Zooptopia is a normal buddy cop movie that sometimes tries to be more and it works but i wish i had seen more of that instead of more of this formulaic buddy cop story because that is what kept my interested.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Judy Hopps, rookie cop and keen as mustard, is disappointed when she is put on traffic duty. She manages to find herself investigating a spate of disappearances, although if she is unsuccessful within a time limit, she will lose her job, which is why she enlists the help of smart petty crook Nick Wilde. Oh, and they are all animals ? Judy is a rabbit and Nick is a fox.This CGI animated feature is a delight. It has a strong story with twists and turns, the action never stops (except in the vehicle licensing office), the city and the characters are all beautifully realised (the characters are especially well designed) and, even though it is a kids' film, there is plenty to see and listen to for adults: it does that wonderful thing of providing an additional, more sophisticated layer for adults to enjoy.Ginnifer Goodwin is terrific as Judy, and Jason Bateman's easy charm suits the laid back Nick well. For me, the only let down on the voices was Idris Elba as Chief Bogo: I didn't think it was a very good characterisation.On the whole, though, this is a first rate film, entertaining for all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Am I sick or a little bit obsessed, or that young rabbit cop named Judy Hopps does indeed have a sexy ass? Either way, this film is a story that captures you and makes you fall in love with it, no matter what age you are, from 7 to 77 and over. Zootropolis is one of the most charming Disney productions ever. It's funny, entertaining, it has a compelling story, clever writing, with a lot of imagination. You can see it several times with the same pleasure, you do not get bored at all. Far superior to "Kung Fu Panda 3" (2016) and especially to "The Wild Life" (2016) Robinson Crusoe (original title), appeared almost simultaneously. I look forward to the second part.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Prepare to be amazed, and transported to a world beyond your imagination!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this animated masterpiece in the movie theater yesterday, and when I walked out I thought to myself "This was the best Disney movie I've seen that was released after Fantasia 2000 was". To be honest with you, I'd actually say this is tied for my favorite Disney movies from recent years with "Frozen" and "Tangled". One of the things I loved about "Zootopia" was that some of the animal characters were influenced by the animated series from the 90's, "The Busy World of Richard Scarry" as well as previously released animated gems such as "Bambi", "The Jungle Book (original)" and the comedy "Who Framed Roger Rabbit". I also thought that Judy Hopps was such a kind and caring bunny throughout the film, and that she really persevered in fulfilling her goals to become a rabbit cop in downtown Zootopia, as well as in forming an everlasting relationship with Nick Wilde the fox, who eventually becomes a cop as well in the end. It was hard to figure out who the villain was in the film, until you find out in the museum that apparently Mayor Bellwether was the suspect of Judy and Nick's crime investigation. There is this really good music singer from Columbia who has released many hit singles in her career, and in this one she releases another hit song called "Try Everything" which is sung in the end credits (and hopefully DOES NOT get covered by KIDZ BOP in the future). This singer is Shakira, and I highly recommend you check out that song, and "Whenever Wherever" and "Waka Waka" as well! But now, back to this movie. I loved all the references to "Bambi" where Judy thumps her left foot to figure things out, in addition to the connection to "Song of the South", Disney's forbidden masterpiece in which Judy and Nick's species are an equivalent of Br'er Rabbit and Br'er Fox. Also, R.E.M. is one of my favorite bands of all time, and I loved it when Judy's alarm clock in her ragged apartment played "Everybody Hurts".Pretty much all I can say about this movie is that I absolutely suggest you check it out because it'll be coming out on DVD a week from Tuesday, and when you see it prepare to be thrilled! It'll take you to a magical animal world beyond your biggest imaginations, and it'll delight you with all the various animal species, all the different districts of Zootopia that each relate to a different type of weather and the influence of real big cities like New York, Chicago and Los Angeles!This movie, "Tangled" and "Frozen" are tied for 4th place in my top animated movies released later than "Fantasia 2000". In third place is an Irish animated film "The Secret of Kells", in second place "The Polar Express" and in first place is a Japanese jewel in animation, "Spirited Away" directed by Hayao Miyazaki.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The animation is great as expected. But the film is definitely geared more to older children and adults. My 5 year old was completely lost before we here even half way into the film and it left me plagued with questions from her about what was supposedly going on. She did however enjoy the jokes but she had picked up on most of these before seeing the film from the trailers.Am I the only person here who has picked up on all the 48 Hours and Another 48 Hours references (the old Eddie Murphy films)? I know it was an old early 1980s film that I've not seen in nearly 20 years but there were a lot of references to these two films, especially the second film. I am not 100% sure but there seemed at times to be a nod towards the Tom Hanks film Dragnet a few times too.Over all I enjoyed the film... lots of references to 1980s crime dramas and films... made me feel like I was watching an animated version of 80s cinema/TV. But a bit too complex for very young children.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First off let me just say the paranoid freaks talking about leftist this, Marxist that and liberal Democratic agendas are hilarious, your world must suck worst than mine! However: they're funnier, I have to point out, than most of the jokes in this film, BUT... Most of the story line in general I shrug off as unfairly simplified for children. It's a cutesy pie way to simplify our situation in America, I expect nothing less from Disney. It feels like this is a movie to be watched and then discussed with children, and with adults, just after. The anthropomorphism of the animals is both over-cooked (way overdone and nothing new) and kind of funny at times (naked yoga animals and Department of Mammal Vehicles, was it? Lol). I agree with some of the comments: its hypocritical criticism of the stereotyping of "the other" while blatantly regurgitating stereotypical characters is kind of annoying and not cleverly done. The obvious and surface message of acceptance is great but like others have mentioned it's ridiculous that even in animation cops can get away with anything and some characters are exempt from accountability of their "bad" behaviour... Then again, that's what happens in life.I've always wished Disney would begin a separate animation studio for serious adult animation. Dealing in an artistic and entertaining way with important contemporary themes in beautiful, innovative and surprising ways. If not Disney then SOMEONE! PLEASE! My weakness is animals and detailed fantasy worlds, hence the eight out of ten. One last thing, to those parents of kids that are scared of everything: if you're raising your kids scared of an animated kids film then you're doing something terribly wrong. I feel bad for the kind of adults they'll turn into and anyone that has to deal with them, yikes (those are some of the people I avoid like the plague).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You can tell that it has taken a long time for Zootropolis to be produced. Usually with movies this is a bad thing - the creators get bored and frustrated and their judgement usually wavers. But this is a great thing for this film - so much time and effort has been spent developing it that you can feel all the hard work and imagination involved.Imagination is key - the world Disney has created is utterly magnificent. Every aspect of the city is rigorously thought through, designed and layered for pleasure, humour and practicality (the multiple door sizes on the trains, for example), so much so that it's almost more interesting to look at than the characters.Speaking of characters, one of the decisions in development was to shift the central focus to Judy Hopps, the wannabe police-rabbit. Great decision - Goodwin really brings out the eager bunny's integrity and ambition, and we as an audience truly root for her more than most protagonists. Bateman's smooth voice is perfect for Nick Wilde, the suave and slick fox, and their partnership is really the backbone of the movie.There are a fair few laughs too, mostly visual gags such as the brilliant city designs, but the sloth scene is unforgettable! The story, on the other hand, is trying to overreach itself. Not every crime-fighting drama needs to be clever and twisted, and the climax was slightly underwhelming and formulaic.With such strong likable characters and wonderfully imaginative world, Zootropolis is almost guaranteed a sequel - an eagerly awaited one!4/5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Zootropolis (Zootopia)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw the trailer for this Disney computer animated film, it looked like both a good laugh and simple but clever idea, then I saw it was rated five out of five stars by the critics, so I was definitely up for giving it a go. Basically in a world populated by anthropomorphic mammals, in rural Bunnyburrow, Judy Hopps (Once Upon a Time's Ginnifer Goodwin) is a rabbit who achieves her childhood dream to become a police officer, graduating top of her class. Judy is the first rabbit to join the police department in the nearby city of Zootropolis, but despite her achievement, she is excluded from handling top-priority cases, specifically for missing predators, Chief Bogo (Idris Elba), a cape buffalo, doubts her ability and assigns her to parking duty, during one of her shifts she meets partners in crime Nick Wilde (Jason Bateman), a red fox, and Finnick (The Fifth Element's Tommy 'Tiny' Lister), a fennec fox. Judy abandons her shift to arrest thief Duke Weaselton (Alan Tudyk), who stole nothing more than some onion bulbs, Bogo reprimands her, but Mrs. Otterton (The Help's Octavia Spencer), an otter, arrives pleading that someone finds her missing husband, Judy volunteers and Assistant Mayor Bellwether (Jenny Slate, a sheep, informs Mayor Lionheart (J.K. Simmons), a lion, of the news. Bogo reluctantly gives Judy 48 hours to solve the case, on the condition that she will resign if she fails, she finds Nick and blackmails him to assist her with the investigation, having recorded his confession of his tax evasion. Judy and Nick determine that Otterton was last seen entering a limousine, to get one over on Judy, Nick deliberately chooses the DMV (Department of Mammal Vehicals), filled with working sloths, the slowest of animals, to track the licence plate, they track the plate number to Tundratown crime boss, Mr. Big (Maurice LaMarche), an arctic shrew. Mr. Big informs the pair that Otterton was his florist, he had "gone savage" and reverted to a feral state and attacked his chauffeur Mr. Manchas (Jesse Corti), a black panther, he tells Judy and Nick that "black howlers" were responsible for Otterton's behavioural change, soon after Manchas himself becomes savage and tries to attack them. Judy calls ZPD to help them, but by the time they arrive Manchas has disappeared, Bogo demands Judy resigns, but Nick defends her and reminds Bogo they still have 10 hours to solve the case, as they leave Nick tells Judy how he was bullied as a youngster for being a fox, which explains why he became a con artist. Judy and Nick consult Bellwether for access to the city's camera system, they see Manchas was captured by wolves, they assume this is what he meant by "night howlers", Judy and Nick locate Otterton and the other missing predators, who have turned savage, at Cliffside Asylum. Judy and Nick also witness Lionheart consulting about the predators' condition, they escape with the evidence and the mayor is arrested, having developed a friendship Judy requests Nick join the Zootropolis Police Department, he happily considers. However during the press conference Judy suggests a biological connection between savaged animals and predators, Nick walks out angry, and fear against predators spreads across the city, with protesting breaking out, feeling guilty Judy resigns and returns to Bunnyburrow. Back home Judy works with her parents, Bonnie (Bonnie Hunt) and Stu (Don Lake) as a carrot farmer, she learns from her former childhood bully Gideon Grey (Phil Johnston), a red fox, that "night howlers" are flowers that have a severe psychotropic effect on mammals. Judy returns to Zootropolis, reconciles with Nick, and finds Weaselton who confesses he collected night howlers for a ram named Doug (Rich Moore) at a secret laboratory, there they find Doug and his team of sheep creating a serum with the flowers, this has been injected into predators via a dart gun to make them savage. Judy and Nick race to the ZPD with the evidence, but Bellwether reveals herself as the mastermind of the species-supremacist conspiracy, she attempts to take the evidence, and shoots Nick with a dart, he turns savage and attacks Judy, but this was an act, they swapped the serum for blueberries, and recorded Bellwether's confession. In the end there is enough evidence for the ZPD, Bellwether and her accomplices are arrested, Lionheart says he did not know about the plot, but admits imprisoning the savaged predators for the "right reasons", Judy is reinstated, the savaged mammals, including Otterton and Manchas, are cured with an antidote, and Nick joins the ZPD as the first fox police officer, and all animals of the city enjoy a performance by Gazelle (Shakira). Also starring Tommy Chong as Yax, a laid-back yak, Nate Torrence as Clawhauser, an obese cheetah, Raymond S. Persi as Flash, a three-toed sloth and Futurama's John DiMaggio as Jerry Jumbeaux Jr., an African elephant. The cast all do their voice parts well, the animals chosen for the parts suit the personalities and their animal traits, and it has fantastic animation, on the surface it is a film with all species of talking animals coexisting in a metropolis, it makes you laugh and has a good mystery to go along with, but is also makes good points about cultural sensitivity and political correctness, it is a well crafted and enjoyable animated comedy adventure. Very good!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautful Animation that Manages to Develop a Great Story and Universe,</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Zootropolis is a fantastic movie with a very well developed storyline and a stellar voice cast. It's a very fun movie that the entire family can enjoy, with humour for all age groups to chuckle at, and a story that is straight forward, but manages to be very compelling. The plot manages to be inspiring as we watch someone fight to become something they want to be, despite the fact no one believes in her, she aims to prove them wrong, I found that very uplifting, as Disney manage to give a talking bunny human qualities. One thing I felt the film was lacking was development in Nick's character, who I found to be the most intriguing, the one the audience would want to know the most about, however, they are far too focused on Judy, I never end up learning as much as I would like to have known about Nick. The best thing about this film is the universe, which the animators clearly put a ton of work in to developing and giving proper scope to, we are given such a good feel for the world of Zootropolis, a society in which all animals like like humans, that by the end of it you will find it hard to believe it is not one bit real. Funny, heartfelt and beautifully animated, Zootropolis is another win by Disney Animation, a must see for the whole family. In a world where all animals live as one, a rabbit police officer tries to prove her worthiness to the force by uncovering an otter who mysteriously disappeared. However, a mischievous fox gets in the way of her investigation.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Zootopia (2016) is a very entertaining family friendly film packed with a great group of talent which brought all of the characters to life. I'm not a big fan of Disney films but they do occasionally put out some well done films even if they are one sided and/or copies of other stories with new faces, but I did like Zootopia (2016) very much.Zootopia (2016) sort of landed in a perfect time for me as I had just got relocated back to the west coast from the East coast, while watching the film in the Sloth scene I couldn't help myself thinking of the East coast at that time versus the west. Once I arrived back on the west coast I stopped at a gas station which was filled with people while I watched one cashier manage to cash out 3 groups of customers at a time and it was so quick the average person was in line for under 3 minutes (we timed it); now to my point. On the east coast at any gas station, every customer check out takes at least 10 minutes (one customer at a time) and that's in high gear; so yes the sloth scenes were a breath of fresh air as well as a lot of laughs.I love the story line within Zootopia, it put some great lessons out in the open while keeping things upbeat; great stuff. I highly recommend anyone to check out Zootopia (2016), even add it to your film collection as it is one that you'll want to watch many times over.</fullReview>

Binding together all the aforementioned elements is an intricate plot which is nothing but a thrilling joyride that plays out extremely well.The fact that comedy in the animal world is distributed profusely based upon the various types of animals makes it a laugh riot. Creators find humour lurking in the remotest corners of the fauna and squeeze out every bit to ensure that you have a great time. Zootopia is brimming up like a carnival where all sorts of animals live in harmony together and basically coexist to comically impede the story with their cussing and nagging letting their animal instinctive jargon to make things exciting.The story-line begins way back in time, and then quickly takes the plot up in the vanguard the moment Judy Hopps reaches Zootopia with her dream job. She has to solve a case that unravels into a bigger game at play as the movie progresses. The intricacies entailed and the mind-boggling revelations at the bottom of it all are thrilling to experience. Nick Wilde makes the story smugger appending some classy humour to the tale. At no point does the fun stop.Animation is simply the best when you can see how much effort has been put into trivial things that we often ignore like the twitching of the nose, the feet movement, the mobile phone that shows a picture of a carrot (well played!), the reaction of them bunny ears to the noise around and every minute detail surrounding the demeanour of the movie characters. Well researched I must say, and well executed! Characters of Hopps and Wilde have been given so much thought! The anthropomorphology they score with their expressions will give you the chills. They are simply that perfect! The sloths are simply the best. Watch out for the Flash! :D</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Parable on Manufactured Intolerance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the idyllic kingdom of Zootopia, with six different types of ecosystems to accommodate every taste and comfort, animals have shelved their differences and both predators and prey cohabit peacefully. There is one shortcoming though; the police force lacks a rabbit. This is soon plugged thanks to the policy of inclusiveness pursued by the mayor and Judy Hopps becomes the first rabbit officer, much against the wishes of her parents who want her to become a carrot farmer. But the police chief, a buffalo, isn't too impressed and assigns Judy, the lowly job of parking enforcement.Don't let this yarn make you yawn. Serious trouble begins to brew in this Utopian metropolis; 14 animals go missing and rest of the film is about how Judy, aided by a clever fox, gets to the bottom of the sordid mystery. Zootopia is a thinly disguised parable on intolerance, xenophobia, stereotyping, discrimination and such contemporary social malaise that we see all around us. The 3D animation is astonishingly beautiful; I wanted to stay forever in that enthralling world.Zootopia is not really a film for kids; I saw many of them getting restless. The content is too adult to be subjected on the innocent kids. But it is utterly delightful viewing for the adults, especially for those who need to be reminded on what is wrong with our world.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Furry Family Fun - Another Disney Hit</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It would be an understatement to say that I was extremely excited to see this film. Not only was the trailer hilarious (that sloth scene slayed me) but I am a huge fan of animated films, and this one in particular had plenty of positive buzz around it.Zootopia is a film that goes beyond a child's world of talking animals and deals with some pretty heavy themes, including failure, bullying and prejudices against those who are different (in this case, it's the predators who are the unlikely victims).Judy Hopps (voiced by the adorable Ginnifer Goodwin) is a bunny with a big dream. Much to the rest of the animal world's amusement, she vows to move away from the humble carrot farm she's inherited from her parents to become a police officer in the big, bad city. She spends the rest of the film trying to prove what she's capable of to everyone she meets, particularly when she teams up with the misfit rascal fox named Nick Wilde (where a deliciously sarcastic Jason Bateman lends his voice).Not only is the animation phenomenal, my kudos also goes to the screenwriters who have created a magical world of evolved creatures that actually don't extend too far from our current reality, making this film very humorous, heartfelt and relatable. This is another Disney gem that will become a family favourite for kids and adults alike.motherofpopcorn.wordpress.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A charming movie with a good, if blatant, message...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is a lot to say in favor of Zootopia, and I think its message of tolerance is a good one. The animation is excellent, the characters personable and engaging, the sound-track appropriate, there is plenty of humor, and the pacing neither rushes nor drags.However, the movie is also terribly cliché, derivative, overly referential, and the good message it has is not delivered with any subtlety, instead beat into the viewing audience in a ham-handed manner that sadly detracts from the movie. The message of tolerance I feel is also muddied given the nature of the distinct predator and prey species portrayed in the movie; whilst humans are humans, and it is only our behavior that categorizes us as aggressive or submissive, in the world of Zootopia, there certainly was legitimate reason to be concerned when only predator species were "reverting" to their primitive aggressive ways.Despite these flaws, it's an enjoyable family movie. Recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Animated Movie That Brought Animated Movies to a Whole New Level</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This review is gonna be spoiler filled so you have been warned. So Zootopia is the story of mammals of all shapes and sizes living in harmony together. Lions, rabbits, foxes, giraffes, you name it they got it. Judy is a bunny who believes she can be anyone she wants to be, and she wants to be the first rabbit cop. And that really isn't normal in Zootopia. Usually the police officers are the bulky, large animals like rhinos and buffalo. But she continues to work hard at making her dream come true and eventually does become Zootopia's first rabbit cop. Yet no one takes her seriously. She doesn't get to be in the chase for all the savages that have been mysteriously been going on. Oh my gosh this movie is amazing! It really is. It's so clever and funny, and everything is so well thought out. It all makes sense. I loved Nick the fox. He was so great in the film. Foxes are known for being smart animals. What was he in this movie? A smart, slick fox. Exactly what he should be. I loved the chemistry between him and Judy.But this movie isn't just funny and smart. It's serious. It has racism, stereotypes, drugs, like the real world. This isn't just some cute kids film. If this wasn't filled with animals and animation, this would be an adult movie. It's so well done. Now let's talk about some of the serious situations. Some of the carnivores in this movie have been mysteriously going savage and hurting and eating the other animals. You find out later that it's because the herbivores have been infecting the carnivores with a drug from a special plant. And the thing is, stuff like that is real. People get stuff like marijuana from plants and genetically modify it to be the most dangerous drug it can be. And the bad part is people actually sell the drugs and give it to people in real life. And do you know what happens? They go "savage" and do the things the carnivores do in this movie. Go crazy. Insanity. Suicide. Murder. All because of one tiny little plant.And because of all these strange savage animals around, people don't trust each other anymore. There is this one scene where there is a mother bunny and her daughter on a train. A tiger goes and sits right by them, acting how a normal person would. Read the newspaper, listen to music. And the mother bunny takes her child and scoots away from the tiger. All because of a plant. It's an awful chain reaction that is true in real life. This movie is so surprisingly mature. No animated movie really dared to cross the line of family-friendly. Zootopia did and it was beautiful. Do I have any issues with the movie? Yeah. It's not huge or anything. But the the main villain of this movie is a tiny little lamb. And even though a normal person can go insane and make drugs, I just find it a little out of place. The other lambs that were working for her looked fine because the had sheep horns and such. Like I said, not big, but it did kinda take away a bit of enjoyment for me for this movie. Guys this movie is truly mature and beautiful. I am so glad I watched it. I am gonna buy this movie when it comes out on blu ray and put on the shelf of other great Disney animations: Big Hero 6, Inside Out, Toy Story 3. Thank you for reading my thoughts on Zootopia.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great movie for all ages!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm sure when you watched the trailer for Zootopia you assumed it was just for children - well, you were WRONG. Zootopia is a great movie for all ages ranging from young children to adults. As a twenty-year-old, my fifteen-year-old brother and I went to see this movie in theaters and it was so much fun. Zootopia involves drama, action, hilarious comedy and even introduces - without you even knowing- the ideas of sexism and stereotyping. In the movie, an independent and charismatic bunny rabbit named, Judy Hopps, is determined to become the first officer that is a bunny rabbit. Being the first bunny rabbit cop involved breaking boundaries and stepping out of her comfort zone which taught her and the audience that everything is possible with hard-work and determination. She graduates top of her class at the police academy; earning her a position at the Zootopia Police Department which is a giant colorful city resembling New York. Hopps teams up with a 'sly, no-good' fox named, Nick Wilde, who helps her find clues in solving a case involving missing animals. Overall, the film deserved an A+ regarding its humor and storyline because its humor was hilarious for all ages and its great plot. I think it's important for kids to identify social patterns including stereotyping and sexism at a young age because it will be prevalent throughout their lives.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Perfectly Fine But Uninspired</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A cute animated film with a great and relevant message about the harm inherent in profiling others based on pre-conceived and ill-informed beliefs. It doesn't have the visual dazzle, narrative tightness, and emotional wallop of some of the best animated films I've seen ("Wall-E," "Toy Story 3"), but I mostly enjoyed its more modest charms. My kids (5 and 7) liked it, but it didn't wow them, and they seemed to forget it pretty quickly after leaving the movie theater, as did I.The funniest part of the film is the segment set in a DMV run by sloths, but since this scene in its entirety was shown in trailers for the movie a year ago, its effect was dampened by having already seen it. Nothing else in the movie rises to the same comedic heights as that moment.Grade: B</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The concept and the trailer for the movie had me expecting something that would be average or above average. After seeing inside out and the good dinosaur I was praying that it wouldn't be another Disney movie that falls flat on it's face and it definitely does not. This movie exceeded my expectations. It was a very engaging story with lively characters in a vibrant animal filled world. The direction is very good and the hard work put into this movie has paid off. It is funny and suitable for all ages. Some people think it's too edgy with concepts, but I believe it's an honest reflection of today's society and the detractors are delusional trolls. I would go see this movie again and plan on buying the DVD when it is released.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Looks like the obligatory Disney hype train is upon us</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Remember the Academy Award winning film Crash and how everyone thought it was the worst Best Picture winner of all time? How everyone hated it because it was very one sided on its views on racism and how even though it was against stereotypes it itself was stereotypical? That's how I feel with Zootopia, which has a 98% on Rotten Tomatoes, but not to the extent of Crash. While Zootopia has good cast and a fun feel it suffers from a bland story, ho-hum characters, and a very uninteresting take on racism. Nothing in the film really ever makes it stand out from other Disney film. If it didn't talk about racism then no one would be singing it's praises. Zootopia starts out with an unnecessary backstory right at the beginning about how the world works in a play that the main character, Judy Hopps, is in. Zootopia is the city in the universe of this film where Predator and Prey live together in harmony. Judy Hopps is the first rabbit to join the police force and is trying to solve a recent case where Predators are being kidnapped. With the help of a red fox con artist, Nick Wilde, they uncover a conspiracy that'll shake the people of Zootopia. Too bad I wasn't shaking because I didn't really care for the characters or the story of Zootopia. I'm not trying to be harsh but I can't hide the fact that I don't get easily invested in stories that are beat to beat generic stories. If you have ever seen a detective film then you have basically seen Zootopia. It does nothing new with what's given and feels like Crash with animals.I hear that many people love how the film talked about racism but it didn't get extremely in depth with it. Just because you talk about prejudice doesn't make your film amazing. When Zootopia talks about racial prejudice it never bring up anything interesting or new. It just says "racism is bad". Agreeing with a certain political or social issue doesn't mean the film is great. I liked Blue is the Warmest Color but I would still give it a 7/10. Just talking about social issues isn't enough to make your film one of the highest rated films of the year. A movie that talked about racism perfectly is Spike Lee's Do the Right Thing. It said that racism is a complicated subject matter and that some people say something is racist just to get their racism out on others. It never agrees with one side and lets you decide what is right. Zootopia never goes deep into these issues as much as it should to make an interesting story.The best part of Zootopia the cast by far. Ginnifer Goodwin has always been a good actress and she brings a lot of enthusiasm to the character of Judy Hopps. Same goes for Jason Bateman as Nick Wilde. I absolutely loved his character at many parts of the film and gave me a smile each time I saw him on screen. The other great actors in the film are sadly wasted, J.K. Simmons is an actor that I have appreciated ever since Spider-Man and I started following more of him after his Oscar- winning role in Whiplash, so I am always extremely disappointed whenever any film wastes him like in the tragic Terminator Genisys. Idris Elba plays a very generic chief but it never goes anywhere new or fun. I personally would have loved to see Elba have more fun and do more stereotypical Chief moments in Zootopia. But there isn't a terrible performance in this film. Disney never disappoints when it comes to voice acting and Zootopia is no exception.Zootopia, while disappointing, is still a fun film that Disney fans will definitely get a kick out of. While it would be great to see Disney tread off the seemingly long and winding generic road they are able to squeeze as much magic in their films as possible. If they do ever make a sequel or decide to talk about other social issues in future films hopefully they can do something risky that will truly make the film exceptional. Maybe not the go to movie to see this year but definitely something to check out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Recently watching Zootropolis (AKA Zootopia to NA and other regions) I wasn't failed to be impressed, Disney yet again have done a terrific job and I've got to say, Zootropolis is one of the best I've seen.It has good morals, teaching us all to treat each other fairly and to not make first and biased judgements of a person and stereotype them; which I think is a good lesson for kids to learn, and even adults! On terms of animation, Disney have done amazingly. The graphics and animation flow is absolutely stunning with excellent detail and animal fur physics.So from me, this film deserves a rating of 10 stars for its outstanding animation, great plot- and not forgetting, great cast!

		<shortDescription>Painfully Didactic &amp; Political</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A great example of how didactism bores rather than inspires, regurgitates rather than re-imagines. There's a clear political message, and the unabashed way which it is presented won't change any minds, but at the least may spark political debate. Though its singular treatment preaching the current "hip" left-wing social platforms without nuance does nothing to elucidate any new ideas or attempt to shed new truths on issues that allow people to re-evaluate their current ideological stances. As such, its effect is similar to that of the person talking politics at the cocktail party who relies on volume rather than substance in order to bolster their (or more accurately their party's) talking points.All in all, though there are some witty scenes and stereotypical romance &amp; coming of age story lines, the overpowering pedantic verbal diarrhea exposes it as a thinly veiled political commercial rather than a great piece of art. The ratings, therefore, represent the extent to which the audience agrees with its sermon rather than recognizes its degree of unbiased (with respect to 21st century American politics) aesthetic merit.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>uninteresting plot and horrendous moral "lessons"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is often seen as being an excellent action-humor combo containing a great moral component. I will briefly try to explain while it is neither of those things.First, I'll start by admitting that the humor present in the movie can work if you put yourself in a certain mood. It is combined with a great visual production aiming at putting you in that exact light-hearted mood, which works fine. The problem is largely the plot: it is uninspired (recycled) and things seems to happen as if they came from a magician's hat. Of course, this wouldn't be a problem if the random/surprising elements where entertaining. The problem is that, while it somehow works in the beginning, where the evolution of the plot make us discover Zootopia, the story becomes quickly bland an uninteresting as the movie enter an action phase.As for the interesting moral components this movie is credited for, they are inexistent. The whole lesson of the whole thing appears to be that you shouldn't listen to your prejudices, and you should be accepting of everybody. We could also add the classical: you can be anything you want if only you would try hard enough. I would start by saying that these "lessons" are so obvious and in-your-face that they cannot have any effect on children. They are what the movie SAYS, but in fact the movie DOES something very different. What it does is to make a link between a character's specie and his personality (in direct contradiction with the lesson about prejudice and promoting inclusion). It also treat most supporting character as pure stereotypes based on specie, which reduce their humanity in the eye of the viewer while using it as joke material. So what the movie in fact does is to tell you that large chunk of population have very few value, while those who deserve respect are the ones who "work hard" to obtain and maintain power over others, be it by wise manipulation or socially recognized opportunity to exert physical domination of others (police). This also implies that those who the film laugh at are deserving of their situation, as they didn't work hard enough to raise above the masses.In short, this movie is a montage of jokes with a plot to support those jokes, which tries to compensate for its lack of substance with "lessons" that are nothing more than virtue-signaling.</fullReview>

It's all here - the 99 percent vs the one percent, cops who just want to serve and protect you (and BTW they're definitely NOT serving the one percent), and ubiquitous public cameras that help solve crimes. And the punch line? The one percent are really your friends - it's those ingrate 99-percenters who are the real criminals.This film is wonderful way to encourage impressionable young children to conform into little statist robots who will gladly empty their minds and hearts to serve as a cog in the machine of the modern lie.And now, a message from your master...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As an adult watching Zootopia, I really enjoyed it. The plot is original, engaging, with multiple plot twists and entertaining. Its on a par with Spiderman, Batman and those type of action movies. That is why everyone is giving 10 out of 10. But my 6 year old burst into tears - way way too much violence, fright scenes and explosive action scenes for a Disney Movie, even with parental guidance. I think its very sad that children movie makers feel the need to get children's hearts racing, just to keep them entertained. It was very over-stimulating for my 6 year old. The story plot was good enough without the need for all the over the top action scenes. It was the same as an adult action movie but with animals instead of 'stallone'. From a child's perspective, my child gave it a 2 out of 10 because it was 'too scary'.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Zootopia. A popular and buzz worthy film. But why? It has nothing new going for it AT ALL. It's been done to death. It's crammed full of nowadays and pop culture references and silly humor. It does nothing fresh or different. The characters are clichéd and nothing new either. Again, WDAS gives us another quirky, optimistic, spunky female lead. Judy is the same as every other WDAS character ever made, except for a small few like Elsa, Meg, Mulan, and that gal from Atlantis. It's so-so, but not superior in any way, because it doesn't actually do anything new or ground-breaking. It's the same old by-the-book cop story, same old cliché plot, and a moral that is handled blatantly and obviously and just keeps beating you over the head with it every minute... It's visually nice, but it lacks any subtlety.And the sexualizing of animals is sick and people who go crazy over wanting to do Hopps sexually and such need lives. Seriously. Messed up. Overall, this film is all hyped now but will most likely end up forgotten years from now unlike actual good Disney films (even some of the more recent ones). This movie is right up there with Chicken Little and Home on the Range. Shame. After Tangled, WDAS has had some good stuff like Wreck-It Ralph and Frozen and hell, even BH6 was better than this furry lovers film (seriously...wth...)This movie is for those who like it safe and not wanting to spend time watching a film that is creative, new, original, and unique. Disney is better than this type of film. Hope they can be impressive again soon. Sadly, all we have now is this terrible film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another bland Animated movie: 5\10 lowered to 2\10</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, as always, critics and people will love this movie, cause it's Disney!(which I deeply love). In reality it's because there haven't been great animated movies in a decade and people are not even noticing how much the standard level is more and more lowering(except Tangled and Toy Story 3, the others were good ideas, with cheap, bland and boring results).GRAPHICS: Once again, we have an animated movie that try to reach even more graphical perfection: the world is wonderfully detailed but its pretty clear that every character of every movie created in CG will look the same. The way they move, the eyes, the facial expressions, are so graphically realistic and at the same time done with exaggerated animated acting, that it's always like watching bad mimes who are playing a part. Rating: 9\10 for the world, 3\10 for the characters(and that's almost the maximum for CGI).CHARACTERS: The fact that Disney can't create great characters anymore is depressing. The characters are boring once again; they are just created to give the most banal and predictable comedy one can watch on a TV sit-com. That's exactly the kind of humor in animation and comedy movies by now. Or even more easy: "Look! an hamster who moves like an hamster! funny!". The fact that an animal has its animal characteristics is the minimum I expect from Disney animation, and even more in the aesthetic normality of the world Zootopia, not treated as a joke. Or even worse, all the pop-culture references, cause they are funny! Ratings: 4\10STORY: The story is kind of good, with a dark tone, and somewhat interesting, but again, the characters are so bland in their predictable personality that I didn't managed to care very much. The point is that, in great artists hand, this could have been a nice movie. Ratings: 6\10And then we got the today moral lesson. That's not a fault for this movie to be honest, because it seems every animated movie must have a moral. And I still don't understand why . Animated movies are an aesthetic art, just like another movie, and not an educational lesson. It's because adults are so dumb nowadays(I'm sorry, but we all know that) that think if something is not educational is not for children. I have an information for you: children are smarter than adults, and they need to be treated as such. Disney, please, don't waste too much time coming up with lessons and a movie created around it, give us some GREAT CHARACTERS AND STORIES like you used to do, and the great lessons of life would come along.FINAL RATINGS: My vote is 5 on a total scale(of all time), and a 7 in the last ten years scale; but the whole feeling of the movie (the characters, the humor, the dynamics) is always the same of every recent animated movie, so I lower it to 2(since I know everybody will give it 10\10).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sly foxes and dumb bunnies come together to make the slickest, smartest animated film of the year</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You owe it to yourself to see Disney's new animated film Zootopia, a film so timely and relevant it's almost startling. You owe it to yourself to seek it out in a time in America where craziness, hatefulness, and fear is being further instilled in the general public by the very same people who should be fighting against it; the very same people who should be forcing us, as a collective, to rise above simple-minded assertions and mass generalizations about the people around us. You owe it to yourself to see this film simply because it's a brand new Disney classic.The film takes place in the vibrant, diverse world of Zootopia, a place where predators and prey live together in harmony, and are free to be whoever and whatever they want to be. These reasons are precisely why the land attracts Judy Hopps (voiced by Ginnifer Goodwin), a small bunny with dreams of being a police officer. Living on a farm, her parents fear this because, not only has a bunny never become a police officer, but they feel Judy should confine her aspirations to selling carrots on the family farm, something Judy has no interest in doing. After successfully completing police training, Judy is thrust into the force alongside other, more muscled animals such as rhinoceroses, rams, bulls, and elephants. Oh my.Judy's boss, Chief Bogo (Idris Elba), a buffalo, forces her to be a "metermaid" while the other animals take on the bigger crimes, specifically a case involving fourteen missing predators. Judy tries to show herself by issuing over two-hundred citations in just a couple of hours, but to no avail, as Chief Bogo wants to make sure she knows her place on the Zootopia police force. When Judy winds up catching a weasel after robbing a store, she is just about to be fired when Chief Bogo tasks her with finding a local otter who has been missing for over a week. If she can find the otter in forty-eight hours or less, she can keep her job, but if she doesn't, she'll be forced to resign. Judy enlists in the help of Nick Wilde (Jason Bateman), a fox, one of the most looked-down-upon predators in Zootopia, who has been doing number of odd jobs since he was young, after blackmailing him in order to get him to cooperate. Together, the two work to find the otter, but in turn, discover something bigger. Oh my.Zootopia wears its intentions on its sleeves, but not in a way that distracts or simplifies its core themes. As you can probably tell, this is a film about both racism and sexism, two features of society that, while probably never going away so long as humans roam the Earth, do not have to be such amplified forces of hate. Screenwriters Jared Bush and Paul Johnston carefully construct a world, predicated upon a particular dream, and within that world, populate it with a variety of characters, some labeled as normative, others quietly labeled as the enemy that many are waiting to step out of line. It doesn't take a scholar to see that rabbits represent women in society, while predators represent minorities.It does, however, take considerable screen writing talent to create a film that can be enjoyed and understood by both children and adults on a fairly similar level. Even Pixar's Inside Out was a film that sort of teetered a bit more to the adult crowd, with its lofty morals about children coping with their emotions, despite the fact that kids of all ages could at least enjoy the film as surface-level entertainment. Bush and Johnston pen Zootopia carefully, but bluntly, to the point where you can't ignore its profound, but simple message of inclusion and acceptance of peers. Oh my.Countless animated films have made themselves about preaching the gospel of acceptance and loving thy neighbor, but few have done it with the kind of thematic relevance, consistent wit, and zealous energy as Zootopia. Rather than sticking too a cleverly storyboarded, intricate plot, Bush and Johnston also have no problem playing around, allowing both Judy and Nick to free-roam in a sandbox full of original characters and allowing conversational/situational humor to prevail. This is why we get uproariously funny sequences involving three-toed sloths at the DMV, in addition to immensely creative, blink-and-you-miss-it chase sequences between a rabbit and a weasel. The film is not short on ideas nor energy, and the remarkable thing is how the film can go almost one-hundred miles an hour in every department and not even come close to running out of gas by the end credits.Zootopia is a contemporary Disney classic and should be treated as such; it will certainly give Pixar's questionable Finding Dory a run for its money in quality, awards, and overall relevance when it comes out this summer. This is a film that finds a way to be both sweet and simple, yet so urgent and topical, with an A-list voice cast, that you feel it's a soft rallying cry for unity, which is all the more reason why you shouldn't ignore it.Voiced by: Ginnifer Goodwin, Jason Bateman, Idris Elba, J.K. Simmons, Tommy Chong, and Octavia Spencer. Directed by: Byron Howard and Rich Moore.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best animated film ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have been watched this film for twice, first in theater and second on computer. Even through a 14-inch screen, I'm still surprised with the refined story and the excellent pictures. It's rare to see a animated film that describes a society which is so close to ours. Most animated films on the market just show us perfect fairy tales. Key roles are innocent and strong (though it may not be the case in the beginning), and negative characters are evil and weak, balabala... ...Compared with these dull and flat animated films, Zootopia is distinguished. It's a brave innovation and try which turned out to be very successful. To be candid, some of the plots in Zootopia are a little terrifying to shock me. But I like it. It makes the film more convincing and they are the shinning spots. I think this is a breakthrough in animated film industry. Directors should be more realistic and profound. Don't just think about the money ignoring the true meaning of making movies. Just like the title of the theme song, try everything, especially new things. We may fail, but at least what we did will leave cherished experience for the other people.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Looking at is sensibly, there was no way "Zootopia" would live up to that kind of hype. Even so, it's definitely a mixed bag. There's one really good gag (the DMV being manned by literal sloths), but runs way too long and ends up shooting itself in the foot several times over. And eventually, the movie's energy (embodied by Ginnifer Goodwin) peters out. Now that I think about it, the movie could've done with more of her and less of Jason Bateman.That said, it does start out pretty well. And above all else, this deserves credit for having a positive message (rising above labeling and stereotypes) and seems to be targeted at all ages. That, I can get behind.6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Is Zootopia Disney's Best Movie?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yes. yes it is but let's not get ahead of ourselves. I don't love this movie because furry reasons. That is one of the stupidest complaints about this film I've ever seen. Ironic how a movie about how racism and discrimination are bad just causes more discrimination. Oh yeah, the theme here is about many serious themes that are going on even today. In fact, this movie came out at just the right time during the presidential elections. It's almost spooky how coincidental that is. The themes are handled amazingly well. It's not shoved down your throat and it's portrayed maturely and amazingly well. Some people might be wondering why I haven't talked about the comedy. Well that's because 1 I don't want to spoil the best jokes and 2 Comedy isn't the primary goal of this movie. No I'm not kidding. The story here is taken 100% seriously. There were tears. I hate having to admit that but there was a scene when I actually broke down and cried. I won't spoil what scene it was because I would feel wrong to spoil this movie but I will say I was so wrapped up in the story and the characters that when something went wrong, I felt their sadness. Going back to the comedy, it's actually really clever like the rest of the movie. There's a lot of clever references to Disney some used for humor and in one instance, to mock their own past mistakes. Yeah that was pretty shocking. Honestly, when I went into this movie I was kind of skeptical. However, when I came out of this movie, I was shocked how amazing this movie is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disney just keeps getting better and better.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ever since they released The Princess and The Frog in 2009, Disney has been enjoying a new renaissance in animation resulting in films like Frozen and Big Hero 6, so when I heard that the House of Mouse were making a film about anthropomorphic animals, my curiously peaked and I went to see it just recently and I must say, this movie was fantastic, from it's beautiful animation and great voice acting to it's morals, everything work perfectly. Zootopia is a movie so well-timed and appropriate, it's almost shocking. At a time when madness, hatefulness, and paranoia have been implanted into the minds of the general public by those who should be battling against it, a movie like this comes along to help us rise above modest-minded claims and stereotypes of other people.The film takes place in the lively, varied world of Zootopia, a place where both predator and prey live in harmony, and are free to be whoever and whatever they choose. These are the reasons that draw Judy Hopps, a small town rabbit with dreams of becoming a police officer, something her parents fear because not only has there never been a rabbit police officer, but they also feel that Judy should keep her ambitions to selling carrots which is the last thing Judy has on her mind. Upon completing her police training, Judy is then pushed into the force with a lot of muscular animals. Her boss, Chief Bogo forces her to be a meter maid while the other cops handle the big cases in order to keep Judy in her place, until he tasks her with finding a missing otter within 48 hours. Judy then enlists the help of a fox named Nick Wilde after getting him to work with her. Together, they must work to find the missing otter, but uncover something far bigger.This movie wears it's meanings on its sleeves, but in not a way that sidetracks from or dilutes its main themes. Two of those being sexism and racism, characteristics of our society that are unlikely to disappear from the Earth, but should never be used as forces of hate. The writers have carefully built a world and within that world, filled it with a variety of animals, some branded as ideal while others are branded as the opponent that many are just waiting for to step out of line. When you watch the movie, it doesn't take a scientist or doctor to tell you that Judy Hopps represents woman while the predators represent minorities.The story is always well placed and connecting and is told with such vigor, magic and emotion that some watching the film will forget the story being a bit on the predicable side. Jared Bush and Paul Johnson have penned the film carefully, but to the point where ignoring the message just isn't an option and while countless other animated movies have preached the messages of loving your neighbor and tolerance, few have perfected it as well as Zootopia has. Not since Hunchback of Notre Dame has Disney dealt with such weighty themes, but deals with those themes with a light handle.Rather than staying with a smartly story-boarded, complex narrative, the writers had no issue having fun with the film, permitting Judy and Nick to wander without restrains in a giant city and allowing informal/situational humor to take it's course which is why we have a hysterical scene with three-toed sloths at the DMV as well as a wink-and you'll-miss-it pursuit scene between Judy Hopps and a weasel or a great Godfather parody scene. The movie isn't short on ideas nor is it short on get-up-and-go and the noteworthy thing is how the film goes at 100 miles an hour in every area and doesn't even come close to stopping by the end credits. The film also has some incredibly smart and humorous writing, cunningly pairing crafty references and clever humor along with honest emotions and heart without any embarrassing tone shifts along with the visual humor which is also a joy to behold.As for the animation in Zootopia, it's never looked better with vivid colors, beautifully designed backgrounds and lovingly drawn characters whose movements are fluid and never move in a robotic fashion. Some of the animation is very imaginative in its set pieces too. The musical score by Michael Giacchino is skillfully crafted and orchestrated, full of energy, and memorable and complements the movie nicely.The characters in Zootopia are all interesting and all have a purpose in the movie with interesting personalities, none of which feel lackluster, shoehorned in, irritating or pointless which is great to see in a Disney film. Judy Hopps is a perfect Disney role model for people, never giving up her dreams when talked down to by others, and is passionate about making the world a better place, not to mention the excellent job Ginnifer Goodwin does bringing Judy's voice to life. Jason Bateman is great as Nick Wilde who starts off as a jerk, but does have a back story much like Judy that gives him some development and makes Nick much more relatable, plus the chemistry between them is incredible to watch. Idris Elba is awesome as Chef Bogo; J.K Simmons rocks it as Mayor Lionheart, Maurice LaMarche's Mr. Big is a hilarious Mafia like Arctic shrew crime boss who steals every scene he's is; Nate Torrance is tremendously delightful as Officer Clawhauser right from the moment we are introduced to him. Flash, the three-toed sloth working at the DMV is also an extremely hilarious character voiced by Simpsons director Raymond S. Persi. Even Latino singer, Shakira provides her voice here and does a great job and her song "Try "Everything" helps to push the morals of the film pretty well.I can't say enough about how much I loved Zootopia, it's an absolutely flawless Disney animated film with something for everybody. Go see it now, you'll love it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>While lacking emotional value, Zootopia still boasts hilarity and an underlying message that applies to everyone.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Zootopia starts out as a world chock full of anthropomorphic animals that go about their lives like ordinary humans, and, thankfully, the story told within that world is nearly as intelligent as the animals that populate it. Also fortunate is the incredible way that the animals begin to feel like human characters walking about the screen; their characters are so real that it is easy to forget that they are animals.This case could be made with many movies that use anthropomorphics, but not only does Zootopia do it especially well, it also plays a clever twist -- not all the animals are civilized! Interestingly, the human race is the same way; many of our own behave like animals inside whilst appearing as human on the out. These are animals, but free animals, not ones in a normal "zoo", and are expected to rise above the oppressive nature humans experience along with freedom. All personas displayed in Zootopia revolve around this idea, one reason Zootopia is thoroughly captivating.Like any good story, these themes are woven through the movements of said personae, one of whom is the principal character, Judy Hopps (Ginnifer Goodwin, Walk the Line), an eccentric rabbit that dreams of being a cop. Hopps has the motto anyone can be anything, and she uses this to motivate herself to become a cop. Nick Wilde (Jason Bateman, Horrible Bosses), a fox reluctant to fight for justice after being pegged as a scandalous cheater all his life, must join together to solve a mystery while fighting an uphill battle against the "speciesist" Chief Bogo (Idris Elba, Prometheus) of the police department and the clueless Mayor Lionheart (J.K. Simmons, Spider- Man), both of whom Hopps works for.Concerning Chief Bogo, any and all actions of his speciesism that occur within the film can easily relate to the racism that happens among humans today. Of course, he still isn't actually the villain; he's not even villainous. He's more of an obstacle that Hopps has to overcome. Bogo's intentions are good. It makes sense that a small bunny shouldn't be able to be a cop. But when he is only holding her back because she is a bunny, that's speciesism. The cynical Nick says "You can only be what you are. Sly fox. Dumb bunny." These types of speciesism in the film are almost identical to the racism or stereotypical boxes that we as human beings put each other into, making Zootopia all too real.Plus, the world of Zootopia is still entirely realistic, despite being animated and not live action! Characters have PB+J cell service on Carrot phones, with songs on them sung by the likes of The Beagles. Zootopia is gorgeous, and if the character and set design weren't enough the details supporting them are as in depth as they are in our universe. Every stone, every rain drop, every popsicle stick is painted perfectly, transcending the norm for animation.As technology continues to grow, the animation will obviously get better along with it, illustrated by the progression between landmark films like Snow White and Toy Story. Zootopia proves technology is getting closer and closer to making that next landmark film. Even characters moving in the background offer to the scene exactly what they need to, something so often missing in animation and as frequently in live action. Zootopia stands as some of the most technically masterful material out there, surpassed only by all of Pixar's productions, particularly their most recent effort, The Good Dinosaur.Like Dinosaur, however, Zootopia doesn't have a perfect story. Several times it becomes annoyingly predictable, and even worse, disappointing because of many cool points spoiled in the trailer. The political statements it makes are intriguing, but they begin to overshadow the story, becoming the focus of the narrative, even though such things should be displayed in the background and be representative of a magnificent story. Furthermore, just Like the political aspect, Nick Wilde takes over the story; the fox would have done better as the protagonist, boasting a dynamic character with more depth than Judy Hopps.Fortunately, the writers built in hilarity and a fast pace atoning for the weaknesses of the film, keeping witty remarks and pop culture references always right around the corner. The Godfather, Frozen, and best of all, Finding Nemo, are either referenced or spoofed in great fun. However hilarious Zootopia is, though, it's icing on the cake (albeit a cake lacking emotional ingredients) to the thoughts that it provokes about society today. "Anyone can be anything", and that makes sense in the world of Zootopia and on Earth. A small, apparently meek rabbit can become a cop if she works for it, even though it may be easier for a larger, more intimidating ox. Similarly, a predator isn't necessarily going to hurt you even though other predators might. That's not to say predators aren't dangerous, if they choose to be, because they can be! They have sharp teeth or long claws that can kill in seconds, but some of those predators choose not to kill. Why? The same reason that being a Muslim doesn't correlate to being a terrorist. Adults will watch and enjoy Zootopia because of its intense philosophical meanderings. Kids will fall in love with the precisely designed and adorable characters. Although all demographics will realize the lack of emotions and flawless stories Disney sometimes produces, everyone will undoubtedly fall helplessly in love with the visuals, quick pace, and the vast and uncompromising world of Zootopia.C: While lacking emotional value, Zootopia still boasts hilarity and an underlying message that applies to everyone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>solid humor, messy but audience-appropriate writing/plot, questionable themes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(crossposted from letterboxd)so, zootopia! the most talked about and anticipated film in the small world i live in. (insert appropriate and thematic joke here.)overall i think this movie is coherent enough for the kids. while the social premise IMO is iffy in the divide between predator/prey and the plot that followed, i do think - and like - that the strongest moral is just not to judge animals - or rather, people, in the real world - by your preconceived notion about them. the reason i'm kinda eh about it is because, aside from nick, it seems that the rest of the society in zootopia treats predators better than prey so then (spoiler) a prey ends up being the main antagonist because they want more respect than they receive. so the antagonist tries to make the predators worse out to be than they truly are, and in the end Judy, who is our hero and falls into the category of prey, tells us not to judge a book by its cover.if we really want to get into this (which i am), someone can easily take the "not all ____!" as the theme of this movie - we're told and shown in most parts that predators and prey live together in harmony, and stay in their own lane. but the predators turn their noses up at Judy - who wants to be a cop - because she's small and nonthreatening. in nick's flashback, we see him being bullied by prey-animals because "why would you think we'd ever trust a fox?" we and they know that predators are above prey on the food chain, and the heart of the movie is to thin and extinguish that line (which reminds me - how and what do the carnivores even eat??) - but the system /is/ acknowledged and enforced with both our protagonist and antagonist. and in the end, there's still an audible "not all (people in a demographic of power)" - which we all know is an incorrect message in the first place.but! social message aside, the /individual/ message of not treating people by your preconceived notions of them is good - and tbh this is more relevant for people who *are* privileged, because it's the cishet white men who are more prone to make transphobic, homophobic, racist, and misogynistic jokes. so without looking at the scope of things, this is a better and more relevant message.other than that:the writing - was cute, kind of harried with a lot going on, likely because of world-building and characterization. halfway through and towards the end it started getting incredibly predictable. i figured that the lamb was behind the whole thing as soon as it was mentioned that she was appointed the new mayor. i'd actually hoped it wouldn't turn out that way, or at least turn out more formulaic - but alas. in the plot it just didn't land for me, felt more like a twist for the sake of a (predictable) plot twist, rather than convincing writing. plus, it turned her whole characterization on its head and felt more cinematic than treating her like an actual character.the reason i'm giving this four stars, though, is because of the humor. despite all my nitpickiness as we can see above, i was laughing basically through the whole film. all of the jokes were gold and landed solidly - shakira the gazelle was somehow hilarious to me, the references to the godfather (which i haven't even seen!) were great, the SLOTHS, and random witticisms and the visual humor really saved this movie for me. anyone who knows me knows that i like to have fun first, everything else is second - and in zootopia, the fun definitely delivered.also, judy and nick's relationship was cute. cheesy, but convincing and easy to sympathize with. i suppose the romance was implied, since i doubt Disney would've green-lighted a cross-species furry relationship - and the "you know you love me" "well yeah, i know i do" at the end was EXTREMELY awkward and cringe-worthy for me. but they do have an adorable friendship (or otherwise) together, and as someone who was a kid once, this movie is definitely emotional and dynamic enough to be good and enjoyable.edited to add: i do want to acknowledge that i know that the whole social theme of this movie is an anti-racist sentiment, but tbh i'm not a big fan of other forms of oppression as a ~metaphor~ for racism - if you want to write a narrative about racism, write a narrative about racism. this movie does not exist in a vacuum but the relationship between the predators/prey in this movie are very different from white people/POC (and other forms of oppression) with humans in the real world, hence my first few paragraphs about why i didn't like it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After a dynamite first hour which is bot eye-popping and vastly entertaining this charming "little movie" goes on...and on. The films being at least a half hour overlong might be acceptable if their was enough good writing to sustain the running time. Unfortunately the film slips into a violent "suspense / action mode which all but destroys the jolly likability of the early scenes. The script also becomes oddly slapdash, rushed and careless.... (random "coincidences" about blue flowers and blueberries just "happening to be in oddly convenient places are insultingly lazy...and the big 'surprise' of the main villain's identity is far too emphatically telegraphed for it to be more than a yawn).I am very surprised that most critics saw fit to just let this slip by with raves (there are in fact even worse bits of laziness (isn't the very trite "Godfather" homage just a wee bit stale by now?).Anyway...this is no "Frozen" or "Big Hero Six"...and one imagines Mr. Disney in his prime would not have let this one out without a great deal of tinkering.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not the Movie only for kids</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Firstly, this is another incredible movie from incredible Disney Studios. A lot of people still thinking animation movies are made for kids. But that's not true. Why people make movies? That's the point. If I made a movie or video or any creation, I will make it for sending a message to the audience (society) to make the world a better place just like Judy Hopps. Zootopia is a funny &amp; interesting movie, but it contains a strong message. The storytellers have tried to convince the audience that how important is following your dream or desire. It is true that Disney usually makes movies upon dreams. But I think Zootopia is more than just a dream. As an animation movie,Zootopia's sound editing and sound mixing are incredible. There are some thrilling and adventurous scenes I could see in this movie than some of the horror movie releasing these days. Also can be seen how Zootopia makers studied about the behaviors&#x200b; of animals and humans and the way they have merged them together seamlessly. As an example the bunny, I realized that she sniffs every time when she's gonna do something just like a real bunny.I wanna say something about voice actors as well. I became a fan of Jinnifer Goodwin after I watched Tinker Bell and the Legend of the NeverBeast. No doubt she is one of the greatest voice actors that I've seen. This is the first time I experienced Jason Bateman's voice. I was so amazingly matching for Nick Wilde. Actually, he's handling more than 70% of his animated character as my point. But my favorite voice of this movie is Yax voice who played by Tommy Chong. Real tight. Everyone must see this movie because of 2 things. The message about chasing a dream. And the other thing is It's a Disney Movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just watched the movie at the weekends, if talk about the movie it is a good one, not so special typical common story, sometimes get bored and only special thing is, it is an animation movie. When I was watching the movie I felt so familiar with the story line, a weak person become a cop then ignored by everyone, then become a hero with the support of another bad guy, finally with a few setbacks they save the world. This is the most common story line in movie history. So the movie makers sell the same story line using animation so the only special thing in the movie is animated characters. It's like directors ran out of ideas they just sell animation. So if someone ask, is this a good movie, yes it is. Is it worth to spend my time and money to watch this? No, there is nothing special, it is just an animation movie with a most common story line.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not bad movie, good message, weak character</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is enjoyable for children and adults, and has deep meaningful message in its story about tolerance and co-existence. This issue is very hot in real life nowadays. Some characters are interesting, but too bad the protagonist is too weak. I know it's about "something that unlikely to be awesome, apparently can be one" character but why a bunny? It's cute but boring. I mean if this character is created 50 years ago, it could be better. We've already known a lot of bunnies with their diverse personality like Thumper, Bugs Bunny, Roger Rabbit, Easter Bunny, etc... enough with bunnies. Judy Hopps, Mike Wazowski from Monster University, Theo from Turbo, and Po from Kungfu Panda 1 has a lot in common: passion, dreams, stereotype, and unlikely background to achieve their goal, but Mike, Theo, and Po are more 'fresh' because they're a monster, a snail, and a panda that hasn't appeared in so many films. So my point is, if only they stick to their original plan to make the fox the protagonist, this movie could be more interesting and fun to watch.</fullReview>

I love that there is no cliché moments in this movie. It's pure and it deserves a 10 out of 10. I love the character of the main protagonist Judy Hoops. Her story is well presented in the movie and brought to the audience. Nick Wilde character is also amazing, with good sense of humor and good story behind himself also. The film starts slow but then it goes faster with unraveling the story, and it keeps you tensed through the whole movie. The twist is good and unpredictable. That is a big plus for this movie.

		<shortDescription>The most fun I have ever had in a movie theater</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay, where do I begin with Zootopia? As expected by Disney, the animation is nothing short of eye candy, even in the places that would seem dull like a night rainforest. The characters are a blast to watch and even just gaze at on their Disney Wiki galleries (if some are, personality and action-wise, mixed bags). The story, rather than the concept, isn't the most original, but is nonetheless executed stronger than other cliché ideas in Disney movies. If you dig deeper from the surface messages of non-prejudice, persistence, tolerance, and cooperation, you will discover one of the most adult Disney movies ever, so much that in the early days of CGI it would more likely be a PG-13 film released under Touchstone. The night howler conspiracy parallels the CIA's crack conspiracy in the 1980s when it was a big circle: We sell weapons to Iran, who Reagan considered our enemy, got money, gave the money to Nicaraguan terrorists (the Contras), received crack, and distributed it to poor neighborhoods under the guise that Communists were behind it. Judy herself might seem like a dreamer who encourages little children to work to be who you covet, but she is also the embodiment of police corruption (check out the trivia section for more info on this). The humor is presented with wit (even the more juvenile ones, despite sometimes working against its message), and everyone at the theater was laughing. It isn't perfect like Mary Poppins is, but I still had fun watching this that I have never had in a Disney film before. Trump supporters are going to soil themselves when we send them and Trump the home video soon enough. Do. Not. Miss. it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A remarkable film, Zootopia blew me away with the amazing visuals, attention to detail and unique writing. It's traditional Disney - a strong moral message behind a colourful, fantastically made beautiful animation.My one critique is that I felt as though perhaps it was a little too preachy - It feels like the creators so deeply wanted to put their message across about racial prejudice that it felt almost forced and not very subtle. Be that as it may, it is a rather touchy subject and I do think that overall, they did a pretty good job with it as a whole.All the characters are well developed and interesting, which is extremely vital for a good movie. Even the minor characters that may only have a couple of minutes of screen time are unique and well developed. The movie did also have a lot of unexpected surprises near the end which you probably aren't likely to predict. Zootopia is a marvelous film, and is worthy to be a part of the Disney classic collection.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Zootopia' or in Germany called 'Zoomania' (no seriously, what's up with this unnecessary name-changing?) is the new animated movie from the creators of 'Frozen' and 'Big Hero 6'. I haven't seen the latter, but since 'Frozen' is my favourite animated movie of the last years, I have to say the Team, here, too, did a great job. 'Zootopia' is a charming children's story for young but also old. The main character is rabbit Judy Hopps, who works more or less against all odds as the first rabbit-officer in the allegedly tolerant city of unlimited possibilities Zootopia (or Zoomania or Zootropolis). Of course nothing goes as planned as she'd initially hoped. With not quite so much help of the cunning fox Nick, Judy struggles to uncover the missing of several animals. The world of 'Zootopia' is in the process not so different from ours. The human-like animals run around with "iPhone's" and drink "Starbucks" coffee or just simply behave human. At the same time, they keep their natural instincts and along with the human part result in an interesting and charming-funny combination, without giving away to much, now. 'Zootopia' is clearly a movie for children but promises small surprises for older audiences, too. The supposedly Mafia-rat ? la Marlon Brando/Robert de Niro or 'Breaking Bad''s Walter and Jesse hidden as animal "Drug" Dealers are great easter eggs for grown up's, that for me elicited one or two massive laughs. For a change, I'm actually glad to have seen the movie in German since they got the German voices of Robert de Niro and Walt and Jesse for the individual roles, which sadly isn't the case for the original movie. 'Zoomania' isn't just funny, sweet and simple amusement. It also contains heavy topics like racism and equality. However, these are handled in a child-friendly way and are in no way forced upon us, as I had feared initially. Joined with cute humor, Zoomania is not only entertaining, but is also, in my opinion, an important movie for young and old.&nbsp;Conclusion: Anti-racism/discrimination children's film, that will and should also find favour with older people. For one thing it offers appealing characters, for another thing a neat story that encourages oneself to overcome one's fears and follow one's dreams. Who cares if you don't have any younger relatives to alibi-watch the movie with. Just watch it. I think we are past the belief that all animated movies are children's movies but rather child- oriented, with a lot to offer for grown-up's. 'Zootopia' in that case currently the best example.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best movie from Disney..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A cute and smart rabbit Judy Hopps is so ambitious and intelligent.She wants to become a police officer. No bunnies ever before became police officers in the animal world of Zootopia because they are not strong enough. But Judy doesn't care what other people and animals think about her . She wants to overcome the prejudice and bigotry that a rabbit is small and weak animal and thus is not fit to become a police officer. She's determined to make her dream come true, but unfortunately for her,she faces problems. She caught a convicted Fox who has already committed a crime, and gave him the option that she can help him to avoid jail imprisonment if only he can definitely help her in finding the missing animals. As a result, the fox and the bunny become friends and because of the intelligence of the amazing Judy (the bunny) she cleverly tamed the sly fox and attracted him to do the good and to refrain from doing evil especially after he fell in love with this yummy bunny Judy. Zootopia is best of the best for the spectacular cinematography,impressive story,enchanting music and mesmerizing acting..</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A really entertaining couple of hours for the whole family!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have now had 2 viewings of Zootropolis (UK name for Zootopia) in 2D and I was really surprised by just how much I enjoyed it. It was effective in balancing out humour with a serious storyline, packaging it in a way that is presentable to people of all ages. Similarly to many successful animations, the story includes several cameos and pays homage to popular culture and film but includes a deep lying political and ethical theme that drives the plot from beginning to climax.The cast deserve a great deal of credit for providing a uniquely and enjoyably varied set of accents. Jennifer Goodwin's voicing of main character Judy Hopes is the best performance for me as she manages to convey an array of emotion and never goes over the top when great deals of excitement and sadness are being portrayed. I found Jason Bateman's deeper and clear voice favourable for his character Nick Wilde as it made it believable that this was an older and wiser character in relation to Judy.No review can be complete without mention of the quality of the animation and the vast scenery and landscapes that have been created for this film. The merger of each animals unique mannerisms with human ones including standing upright on two feet and complex facial expressions are highly crafted. I would love to see a second film where we spend more time in the locations that did not get much exposure including the desert and ice landscapes.My only criticism of the film is the main theme by Shakira. It will stick itself inside your head and the chorus will be stuck on repeat. The worst part is while the sound of the song fits well with the film, it is rather awful without that context with lyrics that rival Limp Biscuit's My Way for worst written song of all time! (That being said I'm a big fan of My Way)I didn't feel that I missed anything by avoiding the 3D screening of the film as it succeeded in entertaining me due to its high quality story telling. I was looking forward to a re-watch which it was successful in being just as good second time around. I'm now looking forward to a potential third viewing which is more than I can say for Batman V Superman; I paid the big bucks for the IMAX 3D viewing and saw a film that has everything it needs to succeed: casting, themes, budget, advertising etc but then makes a dog's dinner of the story!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disney has done it again !!!!!!!!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A brand new Disney classic and what can I say in my review. Marvelous! Splendid! Or it's better to be remain Speechless! Disney's 55th animated film and honestly speaking they did it again. They again crossed my expectations. Have you ever tried Delicious dark chocolate? If not then watch Zootopia, it looks colorful, taste dark where wicked foxes and dumb bunnies came together and made the smartest animated film of the year. The movie tells the tale of a young rabbit named Judy Hopps (Ginnfer Goodwin) from rural Bunnyburrow who dreams of being a cop. But as a kid she got attack for saving a rabbit's life by a fox who told her she was never going to make it as a cop. Fast forward a few years later and Judy decides to leave her hometown and go to Zootropolis (hence the title of the film) to fulfill her dream and to make world a better place for living. From there she moves into an apartment and does some training at the police force and become the first rabbit officer in the police department. However, she has been assigned parking duty by Chief Bogo, an African buffalo, who doubts her potential due to her being a rabbit and thus smaller than most of the large animals on the force. During one of her shifts, she meets Nick Wilde(Jason Bateman) a wicked artist fox. Judy later teams up with him and of course she wants to track down a case as an Otter has gone missing and since he is a suspect (since he was the last one to see the otter). Its up to the two to track down the otter. But there is some strange behaviour going on with the animals? Things start revealing or the Mystery become more dangerous to solve? Could there be a culprit who is turning all the animals against each other? And now there are "Flash (Raymond S. Persi)"(sloths) and "Mr.Big (Maurice LaMarche)". They created many moments where I found myself and other children in the hall rolling on the floor with laughter. One of the first things I immediately notice about the film coming in is the humor and the subject which certainly filled with corny animal jokes, is fit for the characters and the situations. Really salute to Disney productions who managed to take a hugely complicate, controversial subject and show a way out. Even a young child will understand the message upon viewing. This movie was good from start to finish. Its not for only the children but for all ages.The writers of the film did a wonderful job. There was nothing boring about this movie. The voices that were cast for this film were just amazing. Goodwin(Judy Hopps) and Bateman(Nick Wilde) were excellent together among the other great voices that were used, which brought out each character very well. Shakira makes a cameo too as a famous pop star called Gazelle and she sings the main theme for the film "Try Everything"(which is literally stuck in my head since I seen this movie yesterday). I am sorry for this lengthy writing but still I can't stop saying or thinking about the film. So lets do a Summary : Without any doubt, Zootopia is one of the best animation of All-Time and certainly one of the greatest from The Walt Disney Company. The characters, especially Judy Hopps,are absolutely great! You can't help but love them, and viewers of all ages will certainly be able to relate. This is a movie which can be watched by any, and enjoy to the fullest by any. I am quite confident that there will be plenty more in this series. I will go as far as saying that Judy Hopps will become a great addition to Disney as a whole. Please give it a watch because you will love it. You will leave the hall with a smile ,Good feelings n Refreshment. Don't let your age stop you, this is a fantastic movie for anyone of all ages and proves yet again. Take home Message: Disney has done it again, and believe me, this is going to be a big one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great movie, but only if you don't expect a kids comedy...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't think this movie is for (most) kids below 10, the children around me were extremely bored. That is not because the movie is boring - it's because they couldn't follow or even understand most of what was happening. And I can't blame then. Zootopia is much more sophisticated and "deep" than your average animation flick. It follows a quite complex philosophical theme (are we rational, is there still a wild animal in us?). It's not straight-forward comedy, too. There are laughs and chuckles, but they feel more like the writer's secondary motivation. It's, and that you should know, also a thriller, and, at some points, a pretty dark one. Yes, rabbits are cute, but when you replace all the animals with humans, you get a (more funny) version of a film-noir cop movie a la Chinatown.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Zootopia: a so called kids-movie, more daring than most of Hollywood</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Racism and xenophobia are becoming a bigger problem in recent times. Due to terrorism, many people have the misconception that whole religious and/or ethnic groups are guilty. Most mainstream directors and filmmakers are too scared to talk about this risqué subject matter. Of all movies, a "cute" animated movie from Disney for the whole family is delivering these dark themes with excellency.Zootopia is about Judy Hopps (voiced by Ginnifer Goodwin), a bunny who moves to the metropolis of Zootopia, to become a police officer. She is joined by the con-artist, Nick Wilde (voiced by Jason Bateman) who is a fox, normally a natural enemy to the bunny, to solve a case to find a missing otter. The plot on its own is an interesting crime story and will be loved by children.But the actually interesting part of Zootopia is its heavy themes and political messages about prejudice and xenophobia. At the beginning of the film, the movie focuses on the prejudice Judy has to deal with because of her size in contrast to the other policemen and the stereotype of Nick being sly and treacherous, because he is a fox, but throughout the film, it tells more the tension between prey and predators. The city Zootopia is advertised as fair and where everyone lives in harmony. However, it is discriminating against predators for being "potentially dangerous". This is a very clever metaphor for the current situation with Islam in Europe, or black people in America.The animation is very beautiful but does not quite reach Pixar level. The characters are very colorful and the screenplay is often funny but also has very serious moments. The score is OK but not recognizable outside the movie. The main song is in my opinion absolutely terrible. I also think that the last fifteen to ten minutes felt a bit forced. There are many pop culture references to, among others, The Godfather or Breaking Bad.Zootopia is a beautiful movie that will enjoy children but will really interest more mature minds, due to its themes and references. The message is clear, but is not forced. The main song is maybe Shakira's worst song (that means very bad). In total a great, deep but also fun animation movie. 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun-filled movie with a thought provoking &amp; very relevant message</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>**The first thing that struck me,before writing this review was the 8.3/10 rating at IMDb.I have often wondered why some great movies lose 'ratings' after starting very strong.The culprit is probably the high expectations,with which the new movie watchers go in.Its not just a movie now,its a movie which your friend has suggested as a "must watch" or "just go watch it" type movie.**Zootopia tells the story of an ambitious and determined kid,Judy Hopps(OK,she is a 'bunny') She wants to grow up &amp; become a police officer.She is laughed at,and discouraged by her parents.Her childhood is not great either,sprinkled with some bullying.However,she manages to fulfill her dream and lands a job in ZPD(Zootopia Police Department) However,the dream soon starts to crumble as the enthusiastic Judy reports on her first day at ZPD.She faces resistance from her boss who denies giving her a good enough post in the Department.She is barred from an investigation into the current crime &amp; made a traffic cop! The underlying themes are easy to identify: rigidity of the society,sexism,bureaucracy,vote bank politics.But the movie hits a bigger Achilles Heel,which is the insane urge of people to judge on appearance(yes,we are all guilty here) If someone is fat,can he/she never be an athlete? If someone is tall,should he/she only play Basketball? And so on.The movie tells us how these prejudices come to become a part of our thinking &amp; 'common sense'.It turns out that inspite of all her Heroism,even the protagonist is flawed.This makes the movie great.Not only does it reflect on the society,but it does so,in a very non-invasive &amp; almost fun way.A message loses its audience,if its preachy.Here,its just presented as a chain of events that stems from one single line at Judy Hopps' press conference.The film boasts of great voice acting,great animation and some kick- a** music(yes,there's a Shakira song too!) The humour is mature at times,but will appeal to children as well.The jokes are good,the situations realistic,the story is great &amp; the salvation believable.This is more than you expect from an animated movie.It tackles a very mature subject and hits the right notes.The pace is breezy and it ends up,making you want more.So,a big thumbs up to the team at Disney.I enjoyed it and recommend it highly.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wild fun with human quality</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With human warmth, "Zootopia" is an emotional and motivational film, with a basic but intelligent humor, and with a plot whose background is understandable for children and suggestive for young adults. The expression "Never judge a book by its cover" it is a cornerstone in the structure of the story, as goals related to self improvement. The argument is not quite complex, but is thoughtful but not delves into things that ultimately do not matter in the script, as political and economic aspects.The end is predictable, since from the beginning of the story we know the goals of the protagonist and we know that find a way to reach them, but also shows an unexpected turn when knowing the true villain and his intentions, something similar to what It happened in "Frozen" and that in some way perplexes the public. The animation is sublime and very detailed, scenarios are lucid and texture of the fur, skin and clothing of the characters is fantastic with a pleasing level of realism, making evident the great quality that characterizes the CGI of Disney. The low participation of Shakira was somewhat disappointing, considering its extensive mention in the marketing of the film. It includes an interesting social criticism, showing in its outlook a metropolis with a great diversity in its population, whose inhabitants are not spared from being segregated and stereotyped, among which there are those who seek equity and others seeking superiority, and this it is an issue that has caused a stir recently in the United States, the country of origin of the film. Personally, incidental music is one of the most important aspects in a movie, because it gives greater impetus to the emotional aspect of a scene, but the soundtrack of "Zootopia" is discreet and easy. The composer Michael Giacchino made a simple job, that although it is not all bad, is not satisfactory, and pales in comparison to its previous soundtrack, which was "Inside Out". "Zootopia" is entertaining and fun. Revive the charm and genius that characterizes Disney and takes him new horizons.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So Much More Than What You Would Expect</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Zootopia is Disney's latest film and it is a great film. Zootopia is not your traditional kids' movie. It is so much more and it is tons of FUN! Adults can have just as much as fun with this as kids. The story follows a cop (bunny) working with a con artist (fox) to find some missing animals in the wonderful city of Zootopia where predators and prey get along.I was floored consistently throughout this movie because of how mature it is. This movie addresses many social issues like racism, sexism, prejudice, stereotypes, and even drugs. It goes really deep with this stuff and really tugs on your heart sometimes. I kept saying to myself, "Is this really a kids' film?" because this movie has a lot of stuff I think young kids won't understand. But it is still so much fun. The animation is beautiful, characters are written very cleverly, and this movie is extremely funny. Our two main characters are very funny and have great banter between them. The action is well done. This movie is not just a fun kids' movie; it's an entertaining political espionage/spy/conspiracy thriller. I mean this movie is an adults' action thriller but with the cute animals and animation. This could be the plot of the next Mission Impossible or James Bond movie and I really mean that!I have one flaw with this film but it's a major spoiler so I won't say it. Something happens at the end of the movie and it is very predictable and I saw it coming a mile away. That's it.Overall, Zootopia is a great animated film. It has a good story, funny characters, lots of emotion, and most importantly it's LOTS of fun. I think it is definitely the best animated movie since Inside Out. Zootopia gets an A.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Goes to show that Disney still has great ideas up their sleeve!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off, I like to say this movie was not that big on my radar. Sure it looked like a cute, little movie in the previews, but boy I was surprised when I walked out of the theater after this film. Let me first say that the animations were excellent in this film. Disney has done it again, in that aspect of the film. This movie focuses on two characters. A rabbit who is a hard working rookie cop and a sly fox who is quite the con artist. Let me just say that the character chemistry between these two is terrific. Haven't felt chemistry like this in an animated film, since Mike and Sully in Monsters University. The plot advances smoothly through out the film and keeps you on the edge of your seat. The soundtrack was excellent. The humor was very good in this movie, some of which was adult oriented which I enjoyed. This movie went out and surprised me by being entertaining for kids and adults alike. Rarely do you see movies do this and it was very nice to see. The movie while being cute and kid friendly, went out and addressed some social issues in our world, which was a surprising, yet a nice touch to the movie. Overall this movie moved me and gave me the best experience at an animated movie since Up, which says a lot. This movie has its flaws, but they were not major flaws and every movie does. Overall I loved this movie and it is definitely worth checking out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It has both good and bad qualities</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I know it is expected of me to love this movie, but I had some big issues with it. It had two main messages it was clearly trying to convey. One was about prejudice, and the other was about following your dreams; both of which felt poorly executed. They both were inconsistently hammered in. The movie seemed to halt to a stop every time it wanted to say something about racial prejudice/following your dreams, which was extremely distracting. The messages would have been fine (though somewhat generic) if they were more subtly woven into the plot. Also, (this might be just me), but the pacing seemed a bit too fast, to the point where it felt rushed. All that being said, it does have good qualities. A lot of the jokes worked, it had very clever writing, and the characters were very established, unique, and interesting. It has all the attributes you would expect from a well made Disney film, great animation, great voice acting, and immense creativity. Honestly, I really wanted to love this movie, and I do admit it's very well made, but their are some flaws I can't completely look past, and one of those is a poorly conveyed message.</fullReview>

Her leader, the police chief, a buffalo limited her clear up the case within 48 hours. With the help of fox,she smoothly found out that the major convict is the mayor who engaged her into police team before. She became a hero in the city that many news medias asked her for interview. But the other more serious problem appeared that the inhabitant refused to live with carnivores. July felt in pain because this result was not her primary hope. In the end she found she was wrong and rechecked the reason of the case. Needless to say, this moment is the most splendid part in entire film. She admits her mistake bravely.

		<fullReview>Zootopia left me in sheer awe. I finished watching this movie with my jaw wide open, my eyes joyfully dilated, and my breath taken away, just like that sloth when he reacted to the 3-humped camel joke. I actually had a hard time grasping the fact that this was a Disney-only production, for this level of humor and entertainment is unique to Disney-Pixar combo. The plot's major concern is about appreciating the differences while discouraging the discrimination. If I were to decide on it's main theme I would go with "Polarity" since it functions as the motif throughout the whole story and even the funniest gags are formulated based upon polarity and contrast. The master mind behind all the conspiracy is a lovely lamb with a woolly forelock, Mr. Big is no bigger than a petit shrew and guess who is driving the fastest car in the street? Riiiiiiiiiiiiiiiight! Acting is an ace in Zootopia. I mean these anthropomorphized computer- generated mammals made out of pixels and polygons are better actors than many in flesh and bones. The civilized land of zootopia with it's non- human citizens dressed in ties and suits, is so human-like that the scene introducing the naturalist club folks in the nude spa along with their hilarious yoga poses is one of the reasons this movie is rated as PG. And yet my favorite shot referencing The Godfather opening scene, presents Mr. Big, which in my opinion, is acted and animated far better than any cartoon character ever in the history of animation. Not to forget about the unignorable chemistry between Judy and Nick which I wouldn't mind if more of it was offered, maybe with a pinch of romance. All in all, I guess Zootopia restored my faith in Disney after ages.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A beautifully crafted story and great direction by Bryan Howard. Zootopia displays a place of peace and harmony among all the animals. Judy Hopps as the lead antagonist was exceptional with support from Wilde, the Fox. It was something creative with a detective- animated movie but it won many hearts. As always everything goes merry for Walt Disney, Zootopia becomes another one in my list of all time favourite animated movies. Walt Disney continues its miracle touch with the types of movies it makes. Overall, it exceeded expectations and will be a great conpetitor for Oscars 2017.

		<shortDescription>Perfect mix of entertainment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me start out by saying that I made an account just to write this review for this movie. I'm very picky about liking a movie enough to write a review, I don't haphazardly write reviews just because I can. I didn't have any expectations going in because I had never seen any trailers or reviews (heck I hadn't even heard of it) a friend just invited me to go. I like Disney (I say like with a very hesitant intonation) movies so I went. However Disney movies, in the past, have become very predictable and cliché. They are good quality and wholesome but they have always lacked something. They never had the right mix. So over the years my mind devised a grading gradient that each movie I watch had to go through. It determines if the movie is either hapless and unimpressive and be left in the ash heap of history or downright astounding to be articulated into a review. In order for a movie to impress me it has to have a good mix of elements. Here is just a simple list. 1.humor: Disney movies generally have to please children and or parentals. The demographic is typically families. So in order for movies to be "fitting" it has to provide a universal formula of humor. It's typically flat and unimpressive. It's not realistic. And it depends on one-liners. Give me something that has substance and comes naturally. Humor is at its best when it relates to actual real life scenarios. And is not forced or practical. 2. Character development. Sometimes Disney just gives the viewers the gist of what the portrayal of the character has to be and then slashes our hopes of what we thought it could have been. Never mind the $9.99 admission fee or the screaming kids we had to haul over to watch the movie. I GET It there is a time frame for the movie but give us more! We want our minds to be mesmerized and captivated. 3. Dialog: whispering, rough accents, things that are just hard to hear or understand (closed captions shouldn't even be an option) totally ruins it for me. And mysterious dialog that some character said in the beginning and now has nothing to do with the movie. Instead clear precise and actual real life conversations. And I don't want to rely on someone else to tell me what a character said. 4.movie titles: if your going to name a movie name it with the intention that it's going to be said in the movie. Pretentious titles are offsetting and unprofessional. 5 unnecessary dark shadows: I want to see the character and don't mix it with action that has important implications later on. I shouldn't have to rely on someone else to tell me what happened. 6.excessive singing/soundtrack :I get it.its meant for kids but when the movie solely depends on the song for depth and entertainment then it does the movie a disservice. The soundtrack has to match the story-line or at least the geographic location. And singing sometimes just isn't meant to be in it. 7.love story: it's very attractive and it makes the movie more enjoyable. But Disney has a reputation of making every movie an unrealistic love story. Keep it realistic and fluid. A movie is more memorable when realistic connections are made. 8. Annoying comic reliefs. Those characters that are just there to make annoying repetitive remarks and songs. Or actions and appearances. They make the movie tacky and intolerable. Instead give us characters that add to the movie and humor that isn't completely void of substance. 9. unnecessary detours: Disney has to add some detour to make it to appear "fun" or to introduce new songs or characters. At the end its just adds clutter and confusion. Instead use that time to truly focus on character development. 10.forced emotional situations:we don't need to relive the lion King over and over again. And death isn't always a good Segway. Plus those deaths adds more tacky- ness and it breaks away from the cohesiveness of the story-line. Instead emotion is intricate and not always blantonly obvious. Its a subtle touch to the overall tone of the movie. This can also be said for the humor. 11.unexlained events or origins of a characters ability. A character isn't spontaneously made a certain way and then left to uncertainty of its origin or ability. This just adds to the overall quality of the movie. It makes it appear like an afterthought when it should have been the center of the movie (which it ends up being). 12. Overall message: Disney has always excelled at this. However it never ends realistically.which can be unsettling to the viewer. Give us a realistic message that can be applied to anyone. 13. twists:Disney generally is good but it lacks fluidity . Give us twists that connects to the overall movie and not just because it needs to happen. Don't make it seem like an after thought. Well I could go on and on but I just want to say that Zootopia far exceeded my expectations. It hit the mark on every single category. I've never laughed so Wholeheartedly and loud. I never lost interest and it had mystery and great fluidity. 10/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>EXTRA EXTRA BLEEDING HEARTS will be ALL ABOUT IT!WHY?Enough of the hubbub bub, this movie was full of love; yet also daring, intrigue, humor and plenty of good old fashioned moral instruction about how to get along.After years of animated films pumped out by big companies that slyly insert adult references to sexual acts, use of substances that alter ones life, and the general milieu of what makes the world tick once 'paradise is lost' for us all after a certain age, the lesson is finally taught right, and in pretty good taste.I refer of course to the introduction of peace and harmonious coexistence between both predator...and prey. Unlike former works that now resonate in the cultural psyche to both entertain and "learn our younguns some" ( yah thats rude to those from the Appalachians, I hope you all caught the intended irony lol) our story initially is set upon telling us of the natural divide that has always existed between hunter and hunted. Of course having the oh so familiar and almost trite example of a poor farm girl ( bunny) just DREAMING of the big city and the call of the...wild enthusiasm of life, its plain to see where the film was headed.HOWEVER...( I know, too many ellipsis and parentheses. I am eccentric, not trying to be a mean jerk =p) I was pleasantly surprised by the hidden jokes and puns, the running gags of obvious animal instead of human racial tension and assumed tendencies. Case in point, a wolf literally in faux sheep clothing or slow sloths being slow, just because they are sloths. There be meaning in them traits folks. Or even a cheetah being overly obsessed with a gazelle. Think about it and look at the fat police station call operator. Oh, but its just the big city, so its just the way of things. So nature is scapegoated here and there. But along hops a cute bunny, and then... BOOM! a put down by a sharp fanged alpha here and there or an oversized herbivore with too much muscle instead of fat ( my little guy syndrome would be off the charts if I was shorter).Onto Shakira as a pop idol . Perhaps most would not recognize her voice, but at the very least, for those whom recognize her iconic movements, the animal she voiced was quite graceful, even more than the average gazelle, which was in fact her character animal. MAGNETISM! Still little punchlines and a softer use of expressive acknowledgments of racial differences quite eased the tension at times when certain inferred American east coast vernacular and mannerisms were played out, over , and over again. Feeling eventually like an old detective noir sometimes, I cared less and less for the exaggerated implications and easily slid into the story about a wonderful, evolved animal kingdom. Though still present though, the writers could quickly erase the presence of the divides inherent almost to the point that the stories point would have been lost. But ironically, there it would be again, and I wasn't insulted or exasperated of the behalf on any one group. All so clever and in the end harmony was restored and the question of what the sparse predatory part of the city populace actually consumed went unanswered. It must have simply happened when nobody was looking. Was there a possible scenario of butchery where only the strong survive? Yes. Some animals went missing, but not because they became food, they just heard the call, in a way. But still no bloodshed. METAPH-ROAR!Luckily if animals, whether anthropomorphic or not, were good enough for all ancient peoples to use in their cautionary fables, then it is a good thing we have not lost touch with that art form. Otherwise things in a story like this would be inappropriate for sheepish children without that age old, wool pulled over the eyes, yarn spun tactic (HAH triple pun). But bravo Hollywood, fore twas an entertaining success!Just remember, all u human animals out there, there's nothing wrong with howling with the pack, just don't mock others for something that can affect anyone. "Hakuna mata-" YAH RIGHT! I wont finish, so as not to be sued by the relentless, suited ambulance predator. Roar. CIAO ^~^</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The most important animated film in recent years.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's time for your annual dose of animation goodness, and this time around, it's Zootropolis (or Zootopia, depending where you are from) that has graced the big screen. Walt Disney Animation Studios have brought forward some spectacular animated-feature films over the years, from Wreck it Ralph to Frozen, and it's safe to say Zootropolis only strengthens their esteemed reputation.Right off the bat, the animation is absolutely beautiful. Zootropolis does an excellent job in capturing realistic movements and often mesmerising physics, something that is only improving as the years progress. You really get the feeling that each animation is attentively thought out, and it really does show through it's excellent execution. The film is a delight to witness, and makes for easy viewing.Besides the on-the-surface message to follow your dreams, Zootropolis also succeeds in sending another vital message to both children and adults alike ? to respect and support equality. It became clear as day to realise that the 'predators' in this film subliminally reflect ethnic minorities in our culture, and with Zootropolis encouraging unity between the 'predators' and the 'prey', especially between the intricate relationship between bunny-cop Judy Hopps and cunning fox Nick Wilde, Zootropolis is perhaps one of the most important films for children to watch and understand in recent years.Although Zootropolis is filled with hilarious moments, both the sloth scene and the 'Mr. Big' scene, which is of course an amusing nod to Coppola's The Godfather, stole the show. It has been a while since I've laughed out loud to a film, (the last being Deadpool of course) but I have no embarrassment to admit that I was perhaps the loudest guy laughing in the entire screening. And trust me, to make a guy laugh who has the same sense of humour as Sheldon Cooper, this is a truly remarkable achievement.However, it's also sad to see another animated-feature fall into the trap of being another example of the traditional Hollywood narrative, that being; a dream that becomes a struggle, the arrival of an unlikely companion, a built-up resolution which is sealed off with immense recognition. This is a trap that the majority of animated films fail to escape from, and while it's understandable since it is aimed for children, this cannot be used as an excuse to conform to a narrative that audiences have become so accustomed to. I'm not saying that this narrative doesn't work, because for Zootropolis it does, but you can't help but feel like you've seen so many films like it.The finale of the film is also very underwhelming, and to a certain extent, rather ridiculous. You're telling me that the conspiracy that the narrative is tailored around is due to some faulty-flowers? Come on! It's almost as absurd as the toxic plants in The Happening. Yes, I once again have to admit that it's an easy way to reach to children, but for the big kids like me who enjoy these type of movies, it came across as nothing short of half-assed and skimmed over. One more thing ? I came to the realisation that Judy Hopps isn't that good at her job. I mean, she totally blackmails Nick into working with her? you know that's a crime, don't you, officer?For the truth to be told, I had a really good time with Zootropolis. Yes, it may have some silly moments here and there, but this didn't take away anything from the humour and the overall enjoyment from the movie. Let's just see if there's a sequel coming soon, shall we?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Try Everything:)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Zootopia' is the latest Disney animated feature that tells the story of a daring bunny named Judy Hopps (Gennifer Goodwin), who becomes a police officer in a city of civilized animals.1. Walt Disney pictures has outdone itself once again with this film. The animation and level of creativity put into a movie like this is simply incredible. The design of the city of 'Zootopia' itself is amazing beyond belief with sections of snow, desert and rain forest for specific animal residents. The last CGI animated film that featured animals in a civilization that was this good came in 2011's 'Rango'.2. The story-line (besides Judy becoming an officer) in centered on a string of missing animals that have gone savage. Against the wishes of her commanding officer Chief Bogo (Idris Elba), Judy is tasked with finding a missing Otter, but is unwillingly joined on her quest by a suspect and street-wise Fox named Nick Wilde (Jason Bateman). It's really fun to watch this unlikely duo help each other solve this mystery.3. Bateman steals the show just by how sarcastically funny he is in the way his character Nick interacts with Judy and his take on society as a whole. You wouldn't expect much action from a film like this, but there's a lot. In my experience, there weren't many laugh-out-loud jokes, but you get chuckles and delightful moments throughout. There is just an unbelievable majority of cool things here and there that it's hard to mention them all. Besides the Pixar films, this surely stands as a soon-to-be classic for Disney animation that topples the likes of 'Tangled' and everyone's beloved 'Frozen'. Shakira also appears in the film as an animal pop-star called 'Gazelle', who dishes out a terrific song entitled ; 'Try Everything', that leaves a mark even more so than 'Let it Go'.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Zootopia: Race Relations and Feminism Outpace the Genre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILER WARNING. TL;DR version: Acting, Directing, Writing are all great and lend themselves well to the genre, pacing could be worked on but is forgivable. Zootopia is a fun field crime mystery made for the entire family. This movie has, almost everything you could want from a film, cute adorable creatures, a great plot, amazing animation, and of course, world changing social justice themes that will turn children into liberal social justice warriors in just one viewing. Zootopia tells the story of Judy Hopps, our plucky ambitious protagonist who, from an early age, wants to be a police officer in the big city of Zootopia. The only problem is, she's a rabbit and rabbits are far too small to be police officers in a big city like Zootopia because Judy lives in a world where animals have evolved, both predator and prey, together. The world she lives in is inhabited by all manner of creatures, except most primates, which have grown past their wild eat each other ways and now they live in a peaceful society where most everyone gets along and they don't eat each other. Judy pursues her dreams and eventually she makes it through the police academy and is hired on and assigned to the city center. Soon after, she finds out a missing person and she's on the case, but she needs to enlist the help of Nick Wilde, a fox, to solve the case. Bad news is, she doesn't have long and the clock is ticking. The writers and directors of Zootopia are no strangers to this kind of movie, having a lot of experience with animation. Byron Howard, for example, has worked on movies like, Lilo and Stitch, and Tangled, and his experience shines through on this project. The characters all feel like they could be real, and they all have such emotion coming through their computer generated faces (which says something about the animators and their design team as well). All of this work makes for a supremely realistic feel to an otherwise unbelievable situation. And Howard's experience in movies like "Brother Bear" have sharpened his skills in being able to tackle adult themes while still making a movie for the whole family. With the Screenplay writing of Jared Bush, screenwriter of Big Hero 6, you just know you're going to get an amazing and cohesive story without the absolute destruction of a city in order to make you care. That's one of the things I found myself loving about this movie. It didn't feel like it needed to be complex in order to get people to understand. In Zootopia we get to visit a long lost movie genre, the buddy-cop film. Jared Bush brings it back in simple fashion. Not that simple is bad, in fact, simple is great, we need simple nowadays because we haven't had simple in so long that complex has become just a dream within a dream within a dream (I'm looking at you Conception). In summation, Zootopia is a movie for all ages masterfully directed, written, and acted throughout. The message of this movie is timeless and one that was definitely needed at the current state of the world. The scenes are beautifully imagined and created, and the characters are vibrant, alive, and totally believable. The movie itself has an issue with the pace but that can be forgiven for the wide audience that it attempted to capture.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Zootopia! An outstanding film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What a great film! I have heard so many comments about how this film is trying to send the message of tolerance and forgiveness. There have been many cartoons that have dealt with the very same thing and I'm okay with it. It's much better than seeing a movie filled with potty humor jokes that dumb down our youth.Zootopia is a grand film on so many levels! Judy Hops is a brave young bunny who believes in becoming the first rabbit ever to join the police. Years later her wish comes true but she starts at the bottom as a meter maid. Not too long into her job she meets up with a cunning fox named Nick Wilde and this is where her dream takes flight.Zootopia is a great film for our generation. Intolerance and fear is ugly and it is up to us to fight back against it.My only problem I had with this movie was Judy's parents. Talk about cold and uncaring about their own flesh and blood's future.I really enjoyed the line at the end of the film about how change starts with us. It is so important for kids today to hear this message. They are our future and even us adults can change our society for the better.And for the adults who took their young children to see this... why? It was going to go over their heads. It is rated PG, not G. Looking forward to the DVD release.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A bit different!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As always Disney gives us a movie with lots of humor, lots of cute and funny characters and a great story for everyone. But this one in particular I thought was a bit different. From my point of view it's not only targeting kids in the first place, but adults too. The thing is that apart from the fact that the story is played out in a world where animals live together and carry the story (typical Disney environment), the story itself is actually quite similar to what the "Lethal Weapon" movies used to be about and more of an adult kind of plot. A police mystery with lots of action. Without the level of violence from Lethal Weapon of course, though it is kind of violent sometimes and maybe not the best movie to watch with your absolute youngest kids.There are also many references to adult movies like "The Godfather" that you will only find funny if you have actually seen the movie, which I doubt a 7 year old kid has. But not only that, it also takes on issues on a political level that is more than accurate around the world today: racism, sexism, xenophobia, even terrorism is executed to some extent. In my point of view that is what makes this movie darker and a bit different from other recent Disney movies. They have done a great job in taking on these themes in such a simple way that everyone can understand them. Children as well as adults.The characters are very well done! I loved the way they portray every animal, translate their abilities or peculiarities and put them to use in a modern human society. This is one thing that Disney almost never fails at. It made me crack several times and I had such a good time throughout the movie! Also I find it quite appealing that they are moving away from "Princess- land" since a lot of Disney movies has been about a prince or a princess in some way. We've seen all that too many times and it's what made me dislike "Frozen" so much. This one to me is more like "Wall-e" and shows us something fresh in terms of animated Disney movies. Thank God it's not a musical either. This is an action thriller for kids and I liked it!</fullReview>

The building for each character is nicely thoughtful. Not just the main characters, but the whole array of side characters got to have great distinctive traits that easily sets them apart even if the movie has only one species portrayed. The conflict resolution should really be a predictable one for seasoned movie goers. But the movie did it that well that the audience enjoy the flow and forgot their awareness about the predictability of the conflict.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Zootopia is wonderful movie going experience. Lots of fun, with a special message, special characters and a film that is very hard not to want to see again.The voices and the characters are very special. A family of rabbits who have a farm and grow carrots, have an ambitious daughter who would like to be a "police officer." No rabbit had ever become an officer in the city of Zootopia. All kinds of animals had made it to police officer from that city with an incredible variety of animals, (that all speak English) but no rabbit.So our friend decides to try to get into the academy. She has terrific grades and great attitude and gains admission. Her journey from cadet to officer is our experience and I doubt that anyone would not enjoy traveling along. All the characters are fun and believable. (if you can accept the basic premise of Zootopia which we all accept) The fox who is also terrific is a bit of a con artist, but we get to know him and like him too. Others in the film are the family, the politicians, the crooks, and a variety of officers on the force. and more!!I can say the film is exceptionally well written, directed, and voiced in a way that makes us believe that this is real. Animation is my hobby and this is one of most enjoyable that I have ever seen. It is a fun movie in every way. There is even some music that all will enjoy. Go see it. My guess is it will become one of the most popular if not the most popular animated film ever.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Taking our daughter for an Easter treat, we expected this to be okay, but ultimately just another kids film; how wrong we were.Excellent technically, good story, character-driven, fun plot; enough to be interesting but not too much to lose younger viewers; the animation... Just WOW! From the start to the closing credits, exceptional attention to detail, depth and design. The fur on rabbits being distinctly different from that on foxes and them both being different form the otters', etc. Not just simple things like colour and length, but texture, shine, movement, et al. Weirdly (considering their significance in the film) only the sheep were less well realised than all the other animals.Great social references without force-feeding them to us and being over saccharine or sanctimonious; as can often be the case when family films try to ram-home "worthy" messages. Look out for the "don't call me cute" sequence early-on, for a brilliantly handled example.Can't recommend highly enough, an excellent example of the genre. Oh, and the soundtrack is brilliantly crafted to hook all ages. N.B. As testament to the anthropomorphism, I (a gruff, middle-aged British dinosaur into Rock and Metal) with zero knowledge of "Pop Culture" and having not seen so much as a trailer for this movie, was able to impress my family with "Is Gazelle Shakira?"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Zootropolis (UK) or Zootopia (US) is the new fun family Disney animated adventure that finally explains why in all animated films the animals act basically like humans. The film centers on ZPD Cop Judy Hopps who is the first rabbit police officer in Zootropolis and hopes to make the world a better place. However, when she is demoted to parking duty she meets a slick Fox hustler, who becomes the key for Judy to solve a case in the city that will prove her worthiness as a police officer.Zootropolis is a brilliant, exciting and hilarious film to see, very enjoyable for all audiences, and will make your day. It is absolutely fuelled with funny jokes that will even really tickle adults as well. It is visually stunning and so beautiful you would want to visit the animal kingdom itself. It is also supported by a great song "Try Everything". Like "Everything is Awesome" it fills me with an appreciation for life.Like any other animated film, it is filled with heartwarming messages of reaching for your dreams and believing in yourself, but also some more really grown up messages potentially trying to mirror society, such as diversity and understanding. This made the film seem really mature, creating a real impact to me as a viewer. Of course this does not make it inappropriate for children at all. I'd like to see much more animated films with depth.Although I only really got into the story by half way through, so it needs to pick up after a while. But the narrative is one of the strongest points of the film, as you will gather when you see it yourself.The problem with these films is that at the end, it puts you in such a feel good mood, you don't want it to end. One day I hope to see a Disney animated film that is 3 hours long.A very strong enjoyable film, with much more depth to it, not the best animated though but a very good one, 8/10.</fullReview>

While also tackling that of race and accepting people and tolerance for who they are.Ginnfer Goodwin is the lead character Judy Hopps a bunny who wanted to be a cop but people told her a bunny would never make it. But she did as she is sent to do parking tickets. Though she manages despite her small height to make it and never give up attitude despite the odds.Jason Bateman is Nick Wilde a heart of gold, red fox that is a small town con man in the town of Zootopia who is forced into a partnership with Judy.Together they try to find out why some of the animals where they are turned into mammals and viciously so. Which you think with one case it is found and solved. But really it turns the story into a whole new ballgame.Nick and Judy may have their differences but they work together to find out what is really going on. And to find out how and who is behind the turning ordinary animals into vicious monsters.Great chemistry between the leads and supporting staff. One of Disney's cuter movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Zootopia is the film that really confirms that Disney's second Renaissance is more than just a quick blip. With a heartfelt and often moving central theme, stunning animation, fantastic voice performances and an uplifting and fun-loving vibe, Zootopia had me smiling ear to ear from beginning to end.The main thing that strikes you about this film is how much it delves into its main theme, about the celebration of diversity and combating propaganda that creates a climate of fear. It's a very timely topic too, considering developments in the world over the last decade or so, but the thing that's so brilliant about Zootopia is that it brings across its message in a positive and uplifting way.Yes, it may feel a little overly preachy at times, but in the end, that doesn't matter as much, because the way that this film looks at its main theme is so upbeat. That's all emphasises by the wonderful main character, a budding young rabbit named Judy Hopps who manages to become the first bunny cop in the history of Zootropolis, proving all the stereotypes wrong to achieve her dreams.That's one side of the story, but as the film goes on, it talks about the way that fear-based political campaigns work in a slightly more dramatic, but still entertaining, simple and engaging way, which was absolutely brilliant to see, especially considering this is a kids' movie.That level of depth in Zootopia is really staggering, but we mustn't forget that the main point of this film is to give you a good time, which it does brilliantly. Although starting off in slightly generic fashion, this film develops into a really interesting mystery which actually feels a lot like a film-noir.The mystery that develops, in conjunction with the main theme about discrimination, made Zootopia play in a way that seemed oddly similar to In The Heat Of The Night to me (except with talking animals). That story is a lot of fun to follow along to, and with quite a few good jokes thrown in here and there, you won't be short of laughs either.Another really impressive thing about this film is the voice performances. In the lead role, Ginnifer Goodwin is absolutely excellent as Judy Hopps, bursting with happy energy that makes her character effortlessly likable, whilst Jason Bateman, who plays Nick Wilde, the sly fox con artist, is a lot of fun too, using his comedic experience to great effect to provide a fantastically charismatic and fun character to follow.Finally, the animation here is excellent. Disney Animation have reached levels right up there with Pixar now, and, if it weren't for the cartoonish design of the animals, this could be an almost photo- realistic animation, which you can see in the vibrant and visually stunning backdrops throughout.In the end, I loved Zootopia. Its most striking and original feature is of course its main theme, but thanks to using that in a positive way, and creating a generally uplifting film around that, it's impossible to not have a good time here.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Animal Metropolis for All</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The new Disney Animation generation is still on a hot streak, thanks to the success and acclaim of their past, recent hits, Frozen and Big Hero 6. Their latest entry, Zootopia, gives a good omen that the studio is keeping Walt's vision alive to make great animated films like this.Fresh from her home in Bunnyburrow, bunny Judy Hopps (voiced by Gennifer Goodwin from ABC's Once Upon a Time) arrives in Zootopia, a place where prey and predator both live in peace and harmony. Judy is there because she's fulfilling her lifelong dream of being a police officer for the Zootopia Police Department and trying to "make a world a better place". The good news: She's the first rabbit cop on the force. The bad news: She's assigned to parking duty.On the job, she then meets Nick Wilde (voiced by Jason Bateman), a fox and a con artist. They don't get along at first, but soon they decide to team up to take on a case involving some missing mammals. It leads them to places such as a nudist spa, a arctic shrew mob boss' home and the DMV controlled by some sloths (in one of the most funniest scenes I've seen on the big screen in quite a while) to get clues in a period of 48 hours to crack the case. This thoughtful and very funny film is good at the start. But, it gets more poignant and meaningful midway through. The missing mammals plot even has a twist at the climax that is worth a shocker for the audience. The animation is simply splendid. Even the look of the city from its skyline to the areas surrounding the place looks lavishing. Kudos must go to directors Bryon Howard and Rich Moore. There's even homages to The Godfather and Breaking Bad and in-jokes to the past Disney films already mentioned in this review. The voice cast, especially Bateman and Goodwin, are excellent. Other notables in the cast include Idris Elba as Judy's police buffalo chief, J.K. Simmons as the town's lion mayor, Pixar vet Bonnie Hunt (A Bug's Life, Cars) as Judy's mom and Saturday Night Live alum Jenny Slate as the sheep assistant mayor.The film sends home a message that no matter who you are and what you are, we're all in this planet together to make it a "better place". Until Pixar's Finding Dory arrives in June, Zootopia is currently in the top ranking for the year's best animated film. Take anyone you know to see it. And if the movie theater allows, take your pet too.Rating:***1/2Parent Advisory: Zootopia is rated PG for some thematic humor, rude humor and action. Suitable for ages 3 and up.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't even know where to begin. This movie is going to be my all time favorite animated film for a long time.The movie is able to tackle two messages in one. The first is directed at kids, which is that you can be whatever you want if you try hard enough. The other is more for the older audience members, which is the issue with prejudice and stereotypes in our society today. I see the latter as being the more apparent message of the film. Whether it was a joke referencing the N word and black people, or an entire category of animals being discriminated against, the film really shows how terrible these issues are, while still maintaining the entertainment and kid-friendliness of it all.Then let's look at the two main characters: Judy and Nick. This two make the best duo I've seen in quite a while. It does follow the standards of a buddy cop film: the two don't get along but eventually work perfectly with each other. But it's how the relationships between them developed that got me. They started out begrudgingly working together, but by the end you can't see either of them working with anyone else. Yes, you can't see a rabbit and a fox working with anyone else but each other!The jokes were on point, the references were well placed, the detail was superb and all in all, I believe it will go down as a Disney Classic. Granted, some people may not consider it their favorite, but it's like the Lion King or Fight Club: you'd have to be insane to call this film a bad movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Like many other Animation Milestones, 'Zootopia' too doesn't play it safe &amp; aims for alarming results. This Masterful Tale, presented as a delightful Buddy-Cop Comedy-Adventure, is captured as a tale on prejudice and stereotypes, thus making it timely &amp; provocative.'Zootopia' Synopsis: In a city of anthropomorphic animals, a rookie bunny cop and a cynical con artist fox must work together to uncover a conspiracy.'Zootopia' is a riveting, affecting tale, about racism, prejudice, stereotypes, as well as of power, courage &amp; above all, love. The protagonist, a bunny cop, who's repeatedly underestimated by her own family &amp; the people above her, goes on a crusade, along with a Fox, a crook due to stereotyping, to uncover a mystery, that's exhilarating as well as alarming. 'Zootopia' doesn't punch you in the face &amp; yells for attention, but what it does, is slowly build-up &amp; unfold engagingly, &amp; yet make you think about the demons within us &amp; in our society. This is a story about US, how we are responsible for our own actions &amp; how our actions affect our own World. Jared Bush &amp; Phil Johnston's is Excellent. Its bold enough to stand out, yet it never forgets entertain thoroughly &amp; it also has enough scope for some great laughs. This Solidly Written Screenplay deserves all the praise. Byron Howard &amp; Rich Moore's Direction is Fantastic. 'Zootopia' is a visual marvel, with each &amp; every frame, appearing as an absolute delight to your eyes. Michael Giacchino's Score is wonderful, as ever.'Zootopia' is also embellished with magnificent vocal-performances. Ginnifer Goodwin as the bunny cop, the protagonist, is as feminist as it gets. Here's a daring, strong female who breaks stereotypes &amp; Goodwin nails every nuance of the part. Jason Bateman as the Red Fox, is flawless. He adds tremendous depth to the part, thanks to his undeniable talent. Idris Elba as a intimidating cape buffalo who is the chief of the Zootopia Police Department, is fabulous. Jenny Slate as a sheep, who later becomes the assistant mayor of Zootopia, is first-rate. Nate Torrence as an obese cheetah who works as a dispatcher for the Zootopia Police Department, is adorable. J. K. Simmons as a lion who is the Mayor of Zootopia, is commanding, as always. Others great support.On the whole, 'Zootopia' uncovers many themes, without ever getting preachy. This One's A Masterstroke From Disney! Two Big Thumbs Up!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A terrific movie for couples, children, cartoon-lovers, and everyone</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just watched the movie 30 mins ago, and I just can't wait to share how much I loved it! First of all, I think Zootopia is the crowning work among Disney's recent cartoons (by which I mean Frozen, Inside out and The Good Dinosaur. The Big Hero might be equally good.) It actually make people believe that they can do anything if they try hard and that's the very reason why I love Disney cartoons. And the name "Zootopia" (don't know why IMDb displays Zuutopia...) is just as good as the movie. Before watching it, I wondered "what the heck does that mean", but now I can't help applauding for the naming.Secondly, the rabbit is the cutest thing I have ever seen. And the sloth, his show was so hilarious that it made me laughed out loudly in the cinema... And the story is intriguing. For most the cartoons, I can figure out who the villain is after 20 mins of watching, but Zootopia really made me think for a little while.Another reason why I love Zootopia, is because I asked a girl to be my girlfriend after watching the cartoon together, and she said YES, how could I not love rank it 10 out of 10!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best Disney movie so far!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm really impressed with this film. From the first time I saw the first trailer, I wanted to see the movie, but I didn't have anxiety to watch it. I fell in love with film when I watched it for the first time. The film held my attention the entire time. The story of Judy that goes against stereotypes is simply beautiful and not so far from our reality. The story of Nick who accepted his stereotype is simply touching and also is not far from our reality. The relationship of love, trust, respect and affection between the two that is built throughout the film is heart-warming and touches the hearts of all who watch the film, it is unthinkable that a rabbit and a fox have some friendship, but Disney then it can happen! The most amazing is how one inspires the other changing their own world view. The film's story is very well told, interesting, very cute, touching and full. I have to praise and congratulate the team behind the film for the work they did to make each character and to the city, the graphical quality of the film is spectacular in every way! So the film producers show once again that it is possible to tell a good story without drama, without tragedy and without sorrow.I don't remember the last time I saw such a good movie like this one. This time, we have a film that breaks new ground in the way of telling the story, technology, and the created universe. A world with only animals that use our technology is by far one of the best ideas ever introduced in the the cinema. Disney once again gave us a film that ensures good emotions, laughter and fun.With total security, I can say that this film is the best animated film of the year and the best Disney movie ever made!Zootopia, Welcome to Disney's family!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disney animation for the entire family.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The mammals all walk on two feet. They live in a society that is similar to that of people. The mammals are comprised of two groups, reformed vicious predators and the majority of animals who use to be prey. Something sinister is going on.There are a lot of levels to this story which may explain the abundant writing credits. At one level a rabbit wants to be a cop. At another level there is a tolerance message. And there's that power is corrupting message. There also seems to be a don't trust anyone message especially politicians.There may be too much going on for smaller children and it could be frightening. There is plenty for adults to talk about with older children.It is worth noting the movie comes from Disney animation as distinguished from Pixar. It has a more traditional softer look. Take the family to this one there is enough there for the adults and the kids.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Zootropolis</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let's face it, "Zootropolis" was released at just the right time. I know Disney has no control over current affairs, but think about it; the US Presidential Campaign, the refugee crisis. The events in Brussels occurred only a week after the film's release in Ireland. The socio-political commentary in "Zootropolis" is going to hit home for many people.Thankfully, "Zootropolis" succeeds on it's own merits. Here we have a beautifully animated, funny and incredibly smart film. Judy Hopps (Ginnifer Goodwinn) is a rabbit, who dreams of being the first police-rabbit in Zootropolis, a city populated by anthropomorphic animals. However, despite being valedictorian of her police academy, and being assigned to the first precinct by the mayor, she is ostracized for being a bunny, and is therefore placed on parking duty by her prejudiced chief. Determined to prove her worth, Judy teams up with con artist fox, Nick Wilde (Jason Bateman), in order to crack the case of a missing otter. With only 48 hours and Judy's job on the line, she and Nick have to race to solve the case, while at the same time uncovering some unsavory truths about the supposed harmonious city they live in.The film is gorgeously detailed. The architecture, background animations, and little bits and pieces added for the different species of animals; from the frigid Tundra Town, to the drizzly humidity of the Rainforest District. The animation is sublime; the character quirks, the expressions, the eye movements and subtle facial changes. The fur looks so realistic; the way it sticks out over clothes, how it moves in the wind and matts in the rain. Using the camera to show size differences, How, despite walking on two legs, the animals' anatomy was exactly spot on. The canines had hocks, for God's sake! It's so genuinely smart, and hard hitting at points. With dark allusions to days gone by and of present times, the current affairs of Zootropolis are eerily similar to our own. From racial discrimination (even though we see that Hopps is scorned due to her species from the get go, there is a surprising scene where Nick is cast out of an ice cream café for being a fox) to work place racism, to political corruption and mass paranoia. There's a montage scene where there's panic over the predators going savage; a mother pulls her child away from a tiger on a train, and a polar bear is muzzled after mauling a colleague. There is some heavy stuff in this film, and it's funny that, despite it being about animals, it seems more human than our own world.The films is funny; there are plenty of well thought out jokes and one liners, the typical pop culture references. One funny gag is that involving a sloth, which hist home with a powerful home run. The characters are all immensely likable; Hopps and Wilde have amazing on screen chemistry. Thank God they weren't paired together; it's nice to see buddies being buddies. The side characters are all so pleasant and charming. The voice acting is fantastic, even though I will say I was aware that the actors were in a booth the whole time.My only issues came in the last third. We have that stupid falling out scene that always leads to the friends getting back together. yes, it's done well enough and the montage scene after is great, and Hopps' emotions are well portrayed, but it's still cliché and stupid. Also, the twist villains are getting old. I will admit I knew of the villain and bait and switch before going in, but it still seems overused. The villain was society, was that not enough? The bait and switch didn't bother me at all, but the emphasis on Nick's eyes did; it was established earlier that the Nighthowler made the predators eyes go wild. Nick's didn't. That's a nitpick, however, and my flaws are minimal.This is one of the rare times I want a sequel from Disney. Nick and Judy are so likable and fun together, and the world is so imaginative and realized, that the possibilities animate themselves. A lovely film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Best since the Lion King? Well, I don't know, I'd need to do a side-by-side comparison once it comes out on home media, but it certainly has the potential to be so.See, the problem is that, while this film is indeed good, the few times at which it blunders, it doesn't just blunder a little. It blunders big time.Think of it as being- 95% OMG THIS IS AWESOME, and 5% Oh sweet cheese and crackers, why did they do that?!!Some of the dialogue gets very painfully ham-fisted with the discrimination message, and the characters subsequently come across as tragically unaware because of it.A few of the characters, chief among them (pun not intended) being Chief Bogo, fell into this category so often that I actually thought they were being built up to be the villains (spoiler alert: they're not).Equally frustrating about the discrimination angle is that, when you step back and think about it, there actually is a lot of potential rationale behind a lot of the dialogue getting thrown around, but the movie never really explores that and instead tries to use it as a metaphor for our own prejudices (which, again, when you really think about it, they very clearly are not).The sloths at the DMV? That gets old in about five seconds, but the producers clearly thought it was comedic gold and drove it into the ground, turning what could have been an otherwise cute but forgettable gag into an absolute teeth-pulling aggravation.But that's about it for the bad stuff. These bits are liable to irk you, not because they are so bad, but because the rest of the film is excellent by comparison. Judy Hopps is an excellent protagonist, easily the best female lead character Disney has ever produced and in my top five overall. Nick Wilde also excels as a supporting character, even coming across as amusing and likable early when the movie clearly does not want us to feel that way about him yet.The best part about these two characters, and the way they interact with each other, is that, despite being depicted as total contrasts, they are both smart, constantly one-upping and shooting one-liners at each other, so much so that you are guaranteed not to pick up all of them in your first viewing.One scene, for example, has Judy quip after tallying up a figure that "we (rabbits) are good at multiplying." I didn't realize that this was a double-meaning until much later, not because I didn't get it (there's another joke about rabbits and the way they breed that is much more ham-fisted in its delivery), but because I was too busy laughing at everything else going on during this scene to even notice it.Some of the absolute best scenes (and thank Jaguar Jesus, there are many of them) are when Nick and Judy are alone and just talking. They have some of the best dialogue -- the best character interaction -- in any animated film that I can remember, so much so that I would honestly be interested in a spin off TV series or set of animated shorts that was just the two of them sharing an apartment or chatting while on patrol. They are that good together.The plot, though a clear and obvious (and often clumsy) metaphor for discrimination, is by no means predictable, and while you will likely figure right from the start that the character being set up as the villain is not the villain, it will make you wonder if there even IS a villain.Spoiler alert: There is a villain. And the big reveal of who it is isn't that surprising since some of the earlier-revealed accomplices are the same species. But while it is obvious who is going to be revealed as the main villain at the climax, it did still surprise me (albeit not in hindsight) to know in advance that was who it was going to be.And frankly, the big tragedy of them not getting more into the dynamics behind their stereotypes is that it would have been an opportunity to better explore the setting. Zootopia is the most compelling setting -- the greatest foundation for an entire franchise -- that Disney has ever produced.A sequel? Pfft. Zootopia warrants sequels, prequels, spin off movies, spin off TV series, an entire theme park of its own and a multi-server MMORPG. It is THAT GOOD.This movie's faults are glaring, absolutely, and it's a tragedy that they were not addressed, because everything else is pure epic awesomeness. Just go into it knowing what its drawbacks are and you will leave being ticked off at me for not giving this a 10/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>is probably the best way to describe my experience watching Zootopia. First to the short negative bit. The film is both a crowd and a critic pleaser and feels somewhat manufactured in that regard. Having said that, it it very competent in it's aim. The plot is solid and tingles curiosity. The characters are both layered and striking. The visuals are gorgeous and yet rooted. It is wildly entertaining and has a contagious way of handling things. It does not surrender to social or artistic stereotypes. It is a film equally enjoyable for young and old audiences. In short. It's a rarity. I definitely recommend this film. You're going to have a great time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, when we went to go see this film, I had no idea what we were seeing, but after it was over, what did I think of it?Disney did it again!The characters are great, story superb, and the music is great. It also teaches a life lesson, which really shows how life is, and how to follow your dreams.For the story, it follows a bunny who wants to become the first bunny to ever be on the police force. She will find out, that following her dream is hard, and she will get mixed up into a whole other mess in Zootopia.The Animation was gorgeous.And also laughable moments. XDMy final thoughts:Well, Disney has made a new movie that everyone should watch, it give us all a life lesson, it's funny, the story is great, and it shows that Disney can make a good 3d movie without Pixar. So this film is Superb!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Zootropolis is directed by Byron Howard, Rich Moore &amp; Jared Bush and stars the voice talents of Ginnifer Goodwin, Jason Bateman, Idris Elba, Nate Torrence and many, many more.Judy Hopps is a courageous rabbit who has only one wish, to be an officer in the Zootropolis police force. Though, after a day in the city, she learns how tough it is to strive in enforcing the law. After attempting to prove herself to her boss Chief Bogo, who doesn't believe in Hopps, she hatches a plan with mischievous fox Nick Wilde to crack a conspiracy case much bigger than themselves.Zootropolis is a stunning combination of fun and heart. It has laughs and it has drama. It's beautifully animated and carefully thought through with a story filled with adult themes as well as the usual child-friendly humour. The movie picks at a lot of the problems our world is currently suffering from, so the timing couldn't be more perfect.Ginnifer Goodwin and Jason Bateman have admirable chemistry as our misfit pair of heroes and push the story along gracefully. There are a lot of fun characters that instantly become highlights such as Flash the Sloth and Clawhauser the ZPD receptionist. There are many references to other movies and TV shows including Breaking Bad and The Godfather which are very secretive for the younger audience but hilariously obvious for the adults. I love everything about this movie. The original score by Michael Giacchino is pumping with life and energy. Including many instruments catered to the scenes, this is another fantastic frame of work by Giacchino that will please fans and audiences alike. It's fun, action-packed and features loads of refreshing sounds &amp; melodies.The animation is smooth and incredibly detailed throughout, with an extreme amount of colour and being. There's lots going on around the main characters and will open the eyes a little more than any of Disney's previous efforts. My verdict; Zootropolis packs a punch with a talented cast, a fun screenplay, crazy action and a whole lot of awesome music by Giacchino. This is yet another brilliant piece of work by Disney and will undoubtedly do wonders in the domestic and international box office. This is just as much one for the adults as it is for the younger audience. Zootropolis, 8/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of those movies that you quickly judge by the trailer, as a first watch of the trailer, you see the Classic Disney Joke, so the movie didn't catch me that strong... But, when i watched the movie, i discover a new Disney face, a new Disney card, a Card with intelligent humor, deep message, beautiful animation and voice acting.When the first act shows you expect the classic Disney message: "Don't give up, you can do it, you can make your dreams because you 're strong." But, the movie gives a incredible turn of message that leaves you in reflexion.10 years ago, Disney released a pretty lame and awful CGI movie (Chicken Little), now, ten years later, they make a masterpiece of animation. Great job, Disney. Keep with your beautiful creations and movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Almost on par with Inside Out on how clever it can get</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Zootopia is the latest animated feature by Walt Disney Animation Studios. Even though the trailers weren't particularly exciting for me, I had been told it is excellent and worth seeing by just about everyone who had seen it. For the most part, I think they're right. I would say that it is almost on par with Inside Out on how clever it can get.Set in a world populated with anthropomorphic animals, a young rabbit cop named Judy (voiced by Ginnifer.Goodwin) is forced to work hand in hand with a sly con-artist fox named Nick (voiced by Jason Bateman) to uncover a conspiracy involving the mysterious disappearance of some of the "predator" animals populating their city of "Zootopia".Despite the film's seemingly cute look, it delves pretty deep into some dark subject matter and themes such as discrimination, prejudice, class status and even attempted murder. However, it still manages to maintain that Disney family charm and never goes so far as to alienate younger audiences. The film's animation was great to look at and brightly coloured, and the world of Zootopia felt alive and vibrant. Jason Bateman, who I am used to seeing as a straight man in most comedies, was great as the wise cracking Nick, as was Ginnifer Goodwin as Judy. If you enjoy clever Disney films like Inside Out, then I recommend seeing it.I rate it 8.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My review for Zootopia.Zootopia is an interesting film with a strong message that is especially true considering what is happening in the world today. But I'm just going to be frank here, I think this is a film targeted at children, adults and, well, furries. But I don't mind, it doesn't get too wacky and it genuinely entertaining. And I think Zootopia is making mega amounts of money so I'm guessing we're going to get a sequel in a few years but whatever. It is a heck of a lot better than Frozen or the Good Dinosaur. I would rank it as good as Inside Out but no where as good as films like Up, Nemo, the Toy Story franchise and Monsters Inc. I wonder if the studio was surprised with the reception it got. One thing I like about the movie is the world building because for the first 30 or 40 minutes, I wasn't into the idea of animals living together and etc but once the story became more engaging, I was sold. So the film does take a little time to sell you on a world controlled by walking and talking animals but once it does, you become invested in the two main characters, a fox and a rabbit. I found the fox's story especially touching and I think younger, as well as older views can learn from it. And in the world we are living in, I think acting on stereotypes do often result in bringing the stereotype to live. Now that's some deep sh*t there..</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Zootopia is one of the most simple-clever films to ever make it to the multiplex. By simple-clever, I mean the making of prejudice be conveyed in a blurry way that is visually shown here to not be so easy to battle but can be overcome with persistence, amidst a backdrop of Disney's most colourful and diverse fictitious cities ever put to film.Zootopia has the creative nutrients kids lack in their cultural diet these days: an easy to think idea being used as the template of a story that relates to the struggles one kid might face at school, and the thought of easing hostility in everyday life. Disney has gotten away with making one of if not the first fully animated satirical neo-noir film meant for kids.Needless to say, Zootopia is gorgeous, multi-layered, and smarter than you'd think by simply looking at the posters. Disney have mastered their computer imagery for the world of Zootopia and it has payed off wonderfully.</fullReview>

One thing I loved the most about the movie is that it has a great rhythm: I mean the scenes are fast going, they don't lose to much time. Another thing I found great was that everything was connected: no loose scenes. For instance,(SPOILER) saving the small mouse had an important consequence in the future; the acting scene in the beginning was connected with (almost) the last scene.

		<shortDescription>Good deliverance, bad idea</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One thing has to be said about this Disney piece: it is propaganda. Yes, you read right. This is the right name for when a false idea is presented as 100% truth. In this case, nobody even tries to hide it. It has 'utopia' in its very name.That said, I have to admit that it is pretty well delivered. Great animation (*), decent story(*), nice dialogue(*) and probably a crazy budget. Everything you need. Hence my 3 stars. If only I wasn't so annoyed after watching it with my kid!Now, obviously this was made with children in mind, and so the tendency to present the world in pink light is not a bad idea. "Zootopia", however, takes it to the extreme and beyond. It sells a lie. It is, in fact, a metaphor of a liberal, multi-culture mix of society, where everybody should turn the other cheek, be politically correct and accept/tolerate just about everything. Just because tolerance is such a nice word. And because the predators can be tamed. And learn to eat carrots.Well, reality check. They can't. Both in reality and in metaphor.So, unless you wish to start brainwashing your children's really early, I suggest you wait and let them choose their political affiliation a little later.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I know I'm writing a late review for this. I came to know about this movie when everyone is telling me "Zootopia is such a great movie". Finally with lot of recommendations I have watched it with high expectations and it has reached to my level of expectations. One word I can say, it is truly a 'Masterpiece', Walt Disney Animation Studios just nailed it after their successful venture Big Hero 6, couple of years ago. This is 55th Animated feature film from their classic animated series of films. Unlike other animated films, Zootopia has a perfect mystery plot with a message added to it. In fact if you take the story with out any animation, it has really good potential. Clearly we can say that it is an perfect commercial action-mystery oriented script with heavy animation touch. Graphics, Dubbing &amp; Cinematography were undoubtedly top-notch. Zootopia on the surface, beneath the surface, and everywhere in between is essentially flawless. Through its importance with a riveting plot &amp; eye-candy graphics, Zootopia will stand as one of the best works of animation for this entire decade. Walt Disney and Pixar are the best in making animated films, and this is no exception. Don't miss it. !&#x202a;#&#x200e;ChiruReviews&#x202c; &#x202a;#&#x200e;Zootopia&#x202c; &#x202a;#&#x200e;AnimatedFeatureFilm&#x202c; &#x202a;#&#x200e;WaltDisneyAnimationStudios&#x202c; &#x202a;#&#x200e;55thAnimatedFilm&#x202c;</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fails to deliver multiculturalist message</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie is well animated and there were a few lines that made me laugh but overall the movie fails to deliver on it's liberal and multiculturalist message. The problem is that is uses the worst metaphor possible by putting all these different species of animals together. There is a reason they segregate the animals at real zoos, if you mixed them together you would have zoopocalyspe not zootopia. So the metaphor fails in that it is promoting values that are unnatural.The fox character lives up to his stereotype but then the movie comes up with a very contrived reason for this that isn't very believable. The explanation in why the predators "revert back to their nature" is even more absurd rather than just to accept the truth, that they are predators and it's in their nature to behave that way.The funniest part of the movie is the sloths in the DMV. Here the movie goes off it's message and comes up with a great metaphor for anybody who has had to deal with idiots promoted into jobs via affirmative action.The movie would have been hilarious if they would have changed a few things and made it a parody.</fullReview>

In my opinion Zootopia is the best of the lot. From the many pop culture references to the beautiful animation, Zootopia is a movie not just for kids but for adults as well.

		<shortDescription>Delicious dark chocolate, Zootopia looks colorful, tastes dark, but will be among the best films of 2016</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some movies perfectly personifies the past (Saving Private Ryan), some movies predict the future (Fight Club), and some (like this one) perfectly nail the current issues so accurately you feel like they financed, wrote, and filmed the movie yesterday. Read the following sentence slowly because you might not believe it the first time you glance through it: Zootopia is the best film under the Walt Disney Animation Studios banner since Emperor's New Groove, and is arguably the most important animated film since Princess and the Frog. Yes, the clock has to reach back 16 years before you can find a Disney Studios animated film as strong as this one. Between the layers of intense subject matter and a surprisingly strong mystery plot lies a beautiful message for the kids and tweens that needs to be heard, especially today. Nothing on the surface can actually prepare you for what happens once you enter the setting of Zootopia. However, the surface is quite delightful to look at. The animation is spectacularly detailed and contributes mightily to the storyline about animals living together. The main city itself branches off into several subdivisions, each with its own distinctive personality. Unlike most Disney films, Zootopia itself is so massive its practically begging for continuations through film and television. It's an expansive visual feast of colors and colorful characters, similar to the creative world of Wreck-It Ralph. However, once the movie gets going you will quickly realize that although it is a children's movie, there is plenty for teenagers and even adults to laugh at and to be moved by. The mystery is slightly more mature than what is expected, and we even reach quite dark territory once the second half kicks into play. This is a children's movie, but has an incredible script full of heart, soul, drama, and necessary comedy to offset the bleakness. Using Pixar's collective creativity technique (which has been rusting lately), we have three directors and nearly a dozen writing credits attached (two wrote the screenplay, many others contributed to the story). It is a miracle that so many contributors to a single script made a film that flowed so well. Disney and Pixar are the best at coming up with the required vocal talents to bring the animated films to life, and this is no exception. Jennifer Goodwin and Jason Bateman are absolutely perfect for each other and play to their strengths: Goodwin with her charming all-American bubbliness and Bateman's sly hustling ways. They dominate the film but luckily you'll learn to love them immediately through their strengths and their flaws. And in keeping with recent tradition, you won't know who the true villain is until later as the stakes start getting higher.Rich Moore (most experienced of the three-director team) should be a bigger name because his directing credits includes the early 90s Simpsons and some of Futurama's greatest episodes. What those shows and this film has in common is the electric mix of well-paced story, strong characters, and shades of drama and commentary that speaks to the current issues. Zootopia explores racism, sexism, classism, and diversity fears better than any of the trailblazing Disney animated films before it. That being said, it's not a knock on Princess and the Frog, Mulan, or Hunchback of Notre Dame---the truth is Zootopia would have never been fully greenlit by Disney in the 90s, and perhaps even the 2000s. Disney has gotten gutsier and ballsier in recent years with the Too Big to Fail attitude; and although the company definitely remains officially mum on the current political turmoil, Zootopia can and should be its resume and cover letter concerning what side of the fight they are on. Zootopia is a daring animated film that will frighten you (especially the youngsters), will emotionally hurt you, and will leave you thinking long after Shakira's gazelle character lets out her final note. It's the perfect concoction of mystery, comedy, action, and social commentary that not only allows it to become an early entry for Best Animated Feature, but (dare I say it), a Best Picture nomination. Zootopia on the surface, beneath the surface, and everywhere in between is essentially flawless. It has something for everyone, although the youngest ones will struggle as it gets darker. Through its importance as well as the engaging, ever-revolving plot, I give this film the highest marks. Zootopia will stand as one of the best in all of 2016, and among the best works of animation this entire decade. Disney has unveiled its stance through adorable animals while simultaneously proving that it remains the animation king of the world.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was blown away by this. I didn't expect this movie to be like it was. This film is not like it is being promoted, of course it is funny and a little goofy... but it is way more than this. This movie has a lot to say about racism, drugs and other serious issues in life and it succeeded in every way. This movie was not boring one bit, the animations were hands down amazing and I got nothing else to say but: Go and watch this movie you won't be disappointed. Everything is completely thought through and there is a mind blowing amount of detail here for you to see and all of this makes it worth watching more than just one time only. A lot of people cried in my theater, very emotional movie. Also: Great voice acting, extremely funny scene at the end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It would've been a solid 8 if it wasn't for Shakira</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie was amazing, the animation was top notch, the story was quite good, the characters were likable and believable... but Shakira's voice completely put me out of the film.You see, no one would even care about this woman if she wasn't dating Piqué. Her fame days were over and everybody in the hispanic world was fine with it, but somehow she banged her way back to fame with mediocre, catchy songs and that distinct voice of hers that sounds like she's gargling while she sings.So, two different things (and I'm gonna get hated on for this but I don't care) but it definitely affected my experience with Zootopia. Shakira was so incredibly out of place I couldn't believe my ears. I would've preferred Lady Gaga (and I'm not a fan of her either).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Good film. I really, really approve of the message about caring for, and about others and not letting prejudice get in the way. Then I read some of the reviews here, and I found out what this movie is really all about.What this film really does best is highlight the ugly fact that many people on this planet are just mean. They're mean to everybody and they can't stand it that "minorities" play "identity politics" and ask to be excused from some creep being mean to them. I mean, if your way of life is being mean to prove you can "take it" all the time--then having to be "nice" to minorities seems like a YUGE imposition. After all, who do these people think they are? And then they blame the majority for making them (fill the blank) and that's just so UNFAIR! So I read the reviews on here and find out that many folks just do not understand being nice. It's not complicated. Be nice. Just be nice. Be nice. Nice. Be nice. Don't be mean. Be nice.Mean people. They rhyme with pluck. They don't like Zootopia.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Buddy-Cop Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Welcome to this newly created world. Everything lives in harmony and it seems to run perfectly. Let's take this amazing world and make a Buddy-Cop movie out of it and smash some Buddy-Cop clichés into it.Starting off with our Checklist:1. The Police Chief is an Asshole.2. Maincharacter is told repeatedly how he is a looser.3. Mismatched Characters become partners. (Yeye, Nick is not a Cop but he becomes one in the end so I will count it)5. The partners have a falling out.6. The partner/s give/s up his/their Badge/s.7. Two buddies are discouraged from pursuing the case8. But they keep pursuing it anyway, even off the job9. Suspects forcefully interrogated.10. Conspiracy plot that could go all the way to the top11. Corruption.12. Maincharacter gets reinstated instantly after cracking the caseI can probably find more but these were the ones that just came off the top of my head. So why do I still give it a 7/10. It's simple, because making a buddy-cop Movie without clichés is impossible. Everything that is important is how you package it and Disney created an interesting world and characters around those clichés making the viewer forget them. It is not a movie I would watch over and over again, but it is really enjoyable to watch once but it won't stick. Most will forget the movie in a couple of years.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't get how people thought that this was so good, like I heard people saying "This was better than Wreck it Ralph" or "Wow, this is the best movie since Emperor's New Clothes or even 1990!". After coming back from the theater, I didn't feel the same way as other people did. I thought that it had a nice story to it but the characters needed work.This was not better than Wreck it Ralph, though I gave both similar ratings but I thought the characters of Wreck it Ralph had more effort put into them. After seeing it the second time, I liked it more and it became my all-time favorite, although I was only 14 at the time, I thought that it was a nice break from seeing something overly intense or complex.Judy Hopps is a young bunny who was bullied as a child. Though, she still was determined and strong, she carried on with her wish on being a cop. Then, she meets a fox who had the same experience she had.Another small problem was the run time, kids may get bored off of a 108 minute run time. It's a comedy so being at 108 minutes long is too long. But it's still a nice break from something violent or really sad.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Zootopia Zootopia doesn't disappoint to satisfy your wild side. You will without a doubt take a message home with you as you watch all the animals work together in this magical land. Zootopia is about a bunny trying to make it big as the first bunny cop in history. The bunny(Judy) leaves her family to pursue her dreams and quickly finds herself over her head being that she is the only bunny among giant police animals. She is assigned as a meteor maid, but this doesn't detour her to surrender her dreams. She finds a lead and convinces her larger bodied superior to give her a chance at solving the case. If she succeeds she gets to be a real cop! She finds help from an unexpected source (a con-artist fox named Nick) and the duo faces many obstacles, most in which will make you laugh. They naturally cant stand each other, but soon find comfort in the fact they're both judged by their outward appearance. The two end up learning a lot of valuable life lessons throughout the movie. I especially like the part where their investigation takes them to the DMV which is ran by sloths, hilarious! This movie truly keeps you pushing your perception of stereo types. Watch out! This movie will make you remember to never judge a book by its cover. Overall it has a great message of overcoming adversity and doing whatever you set your mind to.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie blew the expectations I had. I saw the trailer thinking, this movie looks OK. I watched it and I walked out the theater saying "I HAVE to watch that movie again!".It was so fun, exciting and really funny to all ages! I went with my family and we had a blast! Highly recommend kids to go because of how much fun it was! The fact that it covers topics such as discrimination and racism so well was mind blowing. I don't think I can picture Zootopia not being nominated or receiving an Oscar for the outstanding work. Whole new level of respect for Disney. The best movie to watch at Easter or spring break(Even though it's past spring break. lol). Wonderful Job and I can't wait for the next movie you come out with!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Average movie carried mostly by great visuals</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Zootopia (in a summary) tells the story of a character whose ambitions do not fit well in the world she lives in.If that sounds cliché, then you would be right.The movie also takes on the (heavy) task of delivering messages around racism, acceptance, and fear of the "different".Unfortunately, the movie under-delivers on both the story line, and the depth &amp; impact of its messages.The protagonist's optimism and resilience is not justified when *everyone* is depicted to be pushing against her dreams, including her parents. Worse still, the story collapses when a typical cheap/easy element is added in, to resolve the build up. It's as if the screenwriters spend all their effort and wit building a story up (easy), and have none at all left when it comes to resolving to a satisfactory conclusion (always the hard part).On the positive side, the tone of the movie is cheerful, with great artwork and visuals.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Used to be Pixar was the far better animation studio at Disney but recently they've been knocking them out of the park with their own Disney Studio Productions! Zootopia is a great illustration: it's fun, witty, has the several layers of interpretation and looks really good.In a nutshell, it's a great animation for the entire family. The only thing one could poke is the cast: it's fairly unknown and not really inspired. Jason Bateman is the only stand out, Nate Lawrence is good in a role that almost sounds like Jonah Hill. The rest, including the title character and an underwhelmed Idris Elba is a little -meh-.But it's probably the only point that one could expect better from. The rest is good fun.</fullReview>

Perfect story with a suspense. Best animation movie ever. Better than "How to train your dragon". I didn't expect the **spoiler** to be the villain. Setup of the animals were perfect. Learned that anyone can do anything and one should be true to oneself.But , if the movie had been a little longer,it would have been a more interesting movie.The sarcasm in the movie was amazing.The movie also should be rated U/A instead of U.

		<fullReview>This was an awesome movie for anyone of any age! I laughed so hard and I'm almost 30 years old. It was silly but tastefully done. There was humor for both kids and adults, for example there was a reference from breaking bad but it was done to where only adults who have seen the show would get why they did what they did and you will laugh. The sloth was amazing! Definitely my favorite part was the sloth! I hope they have a second zootopia! Me and my wife will surely be there to see it! We already have zootopia reserved on blue-ray so the second it arrives we are bringing it home with pizza and watching it again! We don't even have kids and loved it so much. It was not as predictable as i thought it was going to be either. it did leave some surprises and kept you interested the whole time. A must have for any movie lover or kid at heart or even people who love a good comedy! i cant wait for the blue-ray! BTW i loved the sloth so much i got a stuffed one! He was awesome!</fullReview>

I love how they incorporated a popular singer today as someone is their world who is a positive role model to all inhabitants. Also the story behind it was not to judge someone by what someone else says. You should really take the time to give everyone a shot no matter who they are and what you might have heard about them. A really positive way to look at things for people of all ages. I would recommend to anyone!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of Disney's best films, period.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'll admit. The marketing for Zootropolis hadn't pulled me in that much. It was only upon its U.S. release and the flood of positive reception that I thought "okay, maybe this discount Chicken Little is better than it appears". And I'll say, Zootropolis is Disney's best film since Beauty and the Beast. Just because an idea has been done before, in this case, anthropomorphic animals, that doesn't mean that an interesting spin can be taken on it; which is exactly what Disney did, and I guffawed a lot when watching the movie. We have two great lead characters in Jason Bateman's Nick Wilde and Ginnifer Goodwin's Judy Hopps, an incredibly fleshed out world and the social commentary and moral, while maybe a bit on the nose, do feel very timely. Zootropolis is my favourite film of 2016 so far, and I will definitely be buying it on Blu-Ray. A masterclass in animation and storytelling, Zootropolis is absolute brilliance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Zootopia is GREAT</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Zootopia hits all the right marks when it comes to balancing all the elements needed to craft an amazing film. Let's start off with the plot of this film. It stars a bunny named Judy Hopps (played by the talented Ginnifer Goodwin) as she must track down a missing animal with the help of the sly, charismatic fox, Nick Wilde (played by the brilliant Jason Bateman). Other characters were played by Idris Elba, Jenny Slate, Nate Torrence, J.K Simmons, and Shakira (yes she's in this movie; great song by her). All of them did a terrific job playing their characters. The whole world of Zootopia was really fleshed out and you felt for almost every character in it. If you go in thinking that this movie is only for kids, you're wrong. There are great lessons to be learned from this movie, from themes centering around prejudice, to stereotypes. Overall, this movie is powerful, emotion, and very funny (Flash). Highly recommend watching it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A NEW DIRECTION for Disney?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My REVIEW of Zootropolis Disney's 55th Animated Feature Film. Is it the film we all hoped for from the trailers? Does it hold up to some masterpieces like The Lion King, Aladdin etc. Without having a Prince Charming or Princess and taking this film a completely different way the answer is simply YES. This is a fantastic example of Disney taking a chance and NAILING IT. This has a fantastic lesson for children at the beginning screaming "CHASE YOUR DREAMS." Even though Hopps's family was telling her that her dreams of becoming a Cop was unrealistic, she perseveres and that's such a great message. I think it's such a change to see a film marketed towards children to have so many different values and lessons woven into one story. All is not happy and dream chasing for long the film takes a grittier feel in the second act. This is possibly the most racially charged animated feature film that any studio has produced. There are elements of discrimination, prejudice and fear of others who are different throughout this film. Now don't be thinking that this isn't a Disney film as it certainly is with great humour for children. However, not since The Great Mouse Detective have I been so swept up in a Disney mystery. The characters all worked beautifully apart from Gazelle (Shakira), there seemed to be a lot of focus on her but yet didn't move the story along in any way. The sloths however STOLE THE SHOW. To be clear, the movie is very well written and funny I mean some of the self aware references were fantastic. Look out for the Easter Eggs as some of them are genius. There was a period where animated Disney films without the Pixar attachment took a backseat. This may be the beginning of a new era. This is a film I would highly recommend seeing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Widen your perspective</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In this great melting pot of creatures and races, in this world without a single human Zootopia is probably the most important story of the year. Although it is set in this fantasy world it is surprisingly down to Earth and real. Whether it's the messages on racism, being prejudice or having dreams it is really quite thought provoking and philosophical.Before discussing the more philosophical ideas I would also like to acknowledge the brilliance in animation. Now, obviously this is Disney we're talking about so it's obviously to the high Disney standard. But the cast is really pretty amazing, Jason Bateman's Nick Wilde just had such a sly sense to his voice which fits perfectly with his character. Then Ginnifer Goodwin as Judy Hopps just was so charismatic and positive. I've always personally enjoyed Ginnifer Goodwin's performance on abc's Once upon a time so to see her land roles such as this was great, as seeing your favourite TV show actors and actresses transition into the big screen is always exciting. There is a point about having dreams in the beginning of the film when Judy's parents are really against the whole idea of her being a cop and tell her about not believing too much about her dreams. Well that was very real world and mature was what I thought, for a kids movie nonetheless. Not to say that I agree with papa Hopps at all, dreams are cool, they drive us.So to this whole idea of racism and the whole prey and predator thing, in modern day society there are always prejudice ideas and labelling. Growing up and being a teenager in Asia you could really feel that whether it's 'us' towards 'them or vice versa. Personally there is always a thing towards 'Black people' within older generations and a real negative vibe towards ghettos. Being brought up with this idea on the one hand and the very open minded international school on the other hand really made me see the shallow mindedness of certain people. But that's no one's fault, I mean it's no one's fault because fear all brews from ignorance and misunderstanding. People have such limited understanding of the 'outside world' beyond what they grew up on people get a really limited idea of how others are like. They get a very narrow perspective, and I guess that's the thing we always have to widen our view so we can get the full picture and not base our ideas on short sighted and limited views. This movie discusses ideas of labelling, how much that could mean to someone and how hurtful it could be indeed. As previously mentioned, it is important to understand each other, but take it to the next level of embracing those differences. We live in a world of diversity much like 'Zootopia' there are people of all difference shape and sizes people of different races and colours, we all have our defining features but we should never forget that we also have our similarities. Take those similarities as a bridge, or an extending hand but then through those similarities learn about the differences. We live in such a colourful world, but if we choose to live amongst the same black and white there is a whole other dimension that we would never be able to see. For our own sake and for the sake of others, 'Try everything'</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant !! A complete Family movie for kids and adults .</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of brilliant animation movie of recent times.. Thoroughly enjoyable.I went to the movie thinking it might be another Disney extravaganza with very little content. However, I was pleasantly surprised to find the movie is as good as any good Pixar movie.The animation is good , the collective humor is good and the social message is good too. A complete family movie.Characters in the movie goes through the same social issues like racism, social typecasting and segregation and one can relate to it while watching them overcome.This gives a great message to society but that was not done by compromising on the humor or fun. The other movie comes to my mind which did that beautifully was Inside out. Both Inside out &amp; Zootopia are for all age groups and adults will have a great time along with the kids.One can relate to characters like Judy &amp; Nick.Others characters are also Fun. Watch out for the fastest Sloth in the whole city!! Kudos Disney !!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Please keep the rating of the movie in mind!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I always hear things about movies like Zootopia and Inside Out being "too grown up" "not for my 4-5 year old". None of these people have obviously taken the rating of the movie into account. The movie is rated PG (stands for Parental Guidance), and it is rated PG for it's mild themes, animated violence and some scenes may frighten young children. So, had these people actually paid attention and took these sort of warnings into account, they should have known that for a movie that is rated PG for its mild themes that there will be some things that will be hard for the little ones to understand. There will be scenes that will scare them, and the violence (not that there's much violence in this movie mind you) can be a bit horrific to a young child. It is rated PG for a reason, and therefore makes it obvious that the target audience is for children a bit older than the age of 5 or 6. Your kids will most likely not understand what is going on, why the animals have turned ferocious, why Judy Hopps faces gender discrimination and what some of the policemen-terminology will mean.Now as for me, I enjoyed it thoroughly! I found it to be a very clever, very smart, very witty and a very funny comedy Disney has produced. It is very optimistic and light hearted and VERY imaginative. It tells a very great story of a female bunny rabbit who joins the police force (despite all the negativity she has received for being a female and a rabbit) and teams up with a sly, scamming fox to solve a mystery of a missing otter. It has great back stories of not just the character, but of the society that these creatures live in as well! It has great plot twists that even some adults were shocked about. It's such a fun movie and great for almost everyone (except for those I have mentioned in the first paragraph). So again, for the love of god, these movies have a rating for a reason. Yes it's fun to see a movie where there is a society full of talking animals, but that's all this movie has got for your little toddlers.A definite 10/10 from me!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Zootopia is incredible, in league with WALL-E and Inside Out</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I dare say this could be my favorite Disney film, ever. Take a PG-13 rated live action cop-drama/comedy mystery action movie, and make it animated, and THEN replace humans with animals, and give all the animals the intelligence of humans. Then, and only then, will you have Zootopia. And that's exactly what the writers did, with a remarkable commentary on current-day political and social issues.Judy Hopps is a rabbit on a farm who dreams big, dreams of becoming a police officer. No bunnies become police officers, because they're small and weak. But Judy doesn't care about people who tell her what she can and can't do. She's determined to make her dreams come true, but winds up smack dab in the middle of a crime conspiracy. She's caught a Fox red-handed with his own life of crime, and gave him the option to help her with the case of the missing animals, in exchange to avoid going to jail. So the Fox and the Bunny have a bit of a romance, yes yes :) Judy is pretty cute You MUST see this movie. Even if you don't like animated films, I have to recommend it. The voice acting, the production and animation, this is very much a visual TREAT. It's perfect, just absolutely perfect. It made me cry, it made me laugh, and it made me emotional about some struggles I had in my past, but then made me feel hope about my future. This movie is beautiful.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another modern classic from Disney</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Zootopia is the newest animated movie from Walt Disney Animation Studios, who have made films like Frozen and Big Hero 6. The film stars Once Upon a Time star Ginnifer Goodwin and Jason Bateman, and it's directed by Byron Howard and Rich Moore. Byron Howard directed other Disney films such as Tangled and Bolt, and Rich Moore worked on a couple of episodes of The Simpsons and directed Wreck-It Ralph, one of my favorite Disney movies of all time. So this sounds like a winning recipe.The film is about a rabbit named Judy Hopps (Goodwin) who wants to be the first rabbit cop, so she joins the ZPD (Zootopia Police Department). She's moves from her farming life where her parents and other brother and sisters live to Zootopia. Zootopia is a city that consists of nothing but anthropomorphic animals. She's the new rookie cop who of course gets made fun of mostly because of her size, and the fact that she is a bunny. She becomes involved with a case that involves a missing otter where she teams up with a slick con artist fox, Nick Wilde (Bateman), and it's up to them to solve the case only to find out it's much more than that. So the film becomes a buddy cop film/mystery film, a combination I really like, and seems to the best route to go when making a story like this. It leaves you on your toes and keeps you guessing what's going to happen next. Of course, the animation is phenomenal, like all the other previous computer-animated films made by Disney, but it's also some of Disney's best. The world of Zootopia is already big world, and the background animation is beautiful to look at. I love that Zootopia is divided into different habitats, such as rain forest and tundra. It makes for some breathtaking animation. The character animation is also great. Like the fur on Judy and Nick for example. The fur is detailed and so is their actions. For example, whenever Judy is upset or depressed, notice how her ears would go down, a very nice touch. I can't say anything else other phenomenal animation. Right off the bat, Judy Hopps is a very likable character. She's brave, and cares about the others around her. Then there's Nick Wilde, who's the sneaky con artist fox, who's also very likable, especially after his backstory. Other characters Chief Bogo (Idris Elba), a buffalo who's also the chief of police, officer Clawhauser, a cheetah who does nothing but eat doughnuts, and Flash, a sloth who works at the DMV. Trust me when I say, he brings in a lot of laughs. This movie is rich with colorful characters, you lose track because they're so many. But every character is so likable, you wish they have more screen time.I should point out, that it does give an important message about discrimination, a very powerful subject today. This is the reason why I love Zootopia so much. Lovable main characters, incredible animation, and great story that makes this another modern classic from Disney. There is a surprise villain towards the end, but I won't give it away for spoiler reasons. If you want to find out who the main antagonist is, go see it for yourself. This is the perfect movie to take the family to. I would give it a 9/10, but its discrimination message about predator and prey really got me thinking about today's world. So because of that, it gets a 10/10 from me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well I saw this in the cinema and I was blown away when I saw the trailer I knew it was promising the characters are very lovable especially Nick Wilde the con-artist fox and Judy Hopps the Bunny who becomes the first rabbit police officer the film includes a sad scene and you would expect that from most Disney films and the story is very good. The characters are well developed and are filled with awesomeness I recommend this movie to family's and everyone really can't wait for the DVD release but yeah Judy is just a cute character she never gives up on her dreams even if other animals tell her she can't do it she likes to help others and she's very caring Judy and Nick are my favourites (along with some other characters at I don't want to go into much detail about) when I watched it made me want to become a anthropomorphic animal so I could experience what it would be like to be one honestly I'm a big fan of this film so I hope they come out with a sequel so yeah this is my review I recommend it to everyone.</fullReview>

Also I felt bad for Nick during his childhood when he was bullied and no kid deserves to be bullied. Judy Hopps is also cool. I also can't believe that the villain in this movie was that lamb and she was a secret villain just like Prince Hans in Frozen. I also like the song from this movie. Its pretty good too. I don't know much about Shakira though. This movie can also teach kids to keep moving forward. I also really like rabbits and Judy Hopps and Thumper are the cuddliest rabbits ever.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After just seeing the movie with my friends, I am struggling to give more than a 4 out of 10... This is by far one of the worst 3D animations I have seen in the last 5 years, or ever, and we could barely wait until it finishes so that we get out of the theater. The movie is very stressful to watch, and extremely 'humanized'. There is nothing 'animal' about it really. All characters are acting exactly as humans, and not in a good way at all - nasty, obese, following the social programing and expectations to conform others. I would personally not recommend this movie to any child, unless you really want them to become another robot.To summarize: Boring, dull, not funny, not cute at all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, Disney has done it again. Zootopia has volume in its complexity, message, and characters, along with some risk taking values that's brings the classic Disney back on screen. This is a film that explains what made Disney great in the past for the reasons of taking chances with a compelling, funny story and premise. They take the simple idea of animals living in the city and bring us the next great animated film. This may be a comedy like most animated films, but deep down this is something more. If you look deeper into the film for its meaning it actually handles today's problems with socialism, and racism in a very comical, and non-offensive manner. Prey vs. predator, they each treat each other differently because of their differences. This film teaches us to deal with differences, and help anyone at any time. Nowadays animated films are a force to be reckoned with, and this is a perfect example. Now to grade.

		<fullReview>Disney has another classic on there hands with Zootopia! Its a very fun and action-packed buddy cop comedy starting a fox and a bunny, and it works perfectly. Goodwin and Batemen are perfect in their roles and have great chemistry together as the films leads. The world of Zootopia is awe inspiring as well. You're gonna want to visit this city after you watch the movie. The movie also has deep messages about racism and discrimination, which I never expected from a Disney movie about animals, but it is done in such a great way that, like most things in this movie, it works great. My only real complaint is the character of Gazelle. She has absolutely nothing to do with the plot of the movie, and is only there to sing the new Disney pop song. But overall, this is a great movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film displays many discourses on real world subjects and for that I give this a thumbs up. Though it may not explicitly refer to the real world, there are definitely similarities in Zootopia in which children growing up can extend to their world. The stereotyping based on appearance and 'biology' was a big theme in the film, and ultimately hints at race (that is how I interpreted it anyhow). I feel that the film did a great job at discussing the stigma attached to certain appearances, as well as finding a resolution to this way of thought. Appearances do not govern who we are, and biology does not dictate who we become. Additionally, the script is superb and keeps audiences engaged. The voice actors did a great job - as did the animators, to create the life of these characters. I also really loved (and was also somewhat annoyed by) the addition of the sloths. They added a comedic and recurrent comedic effect, and their slow motion is both hilarious and frustrating to watch.Though I do think the characters and voice actors complemented each other well, I noticed that certain characters would have accents. For example, the 'mafia' like character, Mr. Big (Maurice LaMarche) has a typical Latino type accent and the yoga instructor Nangi (Gita Reddy) has an Indian accent. I was quite taken aback by this and though it is great to have diversity in the cast, the film should not encourage the stereotyping of race and character. Also, large characters seemed to have loud booming voices that correlated to their size, and smaller characters tended to have softer, squeaky voices. Size does not determine pitch of voice, and this reinforces the idea that people who do not conform to this ideal is abnormal.Overall, this is a fun and engaging film with good discourses but disappointing voice stereotypes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Great Reflection of Today's Society</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With Pixar being owned by Disney, there seems to have been a nice amount of bleed over between the two, Pixar is more consistent with the quality of their films, but every once and awhile a movie of Pixar's quality comes from Disney. We should remember that Disney was once, and in many ways still is the premiere animation company, but not that long ago they had been struggling to put out great films. Zootopia is smart, funny, and is mature in its storytelling and in its message. It's very nice to see a movie directed at kids that has respect and treats kids as people who can understand complex themes, not mindless creatures that need simple clichéd messages.In that respect Zootopia is more like a Pixar film, where Pixar has shown an understanding that complex messages can be the most emotionally powerful and while being complex can be presented in a simple, and straightforward way. Much like Inside Out taught us so much about using our emotions, especially sadness, Zootopia has a great message about fear and the treatment of entire groups of people because of that fear. It's ironic, because the movie indirectly latches onto an issue that is relevant today, with an air of innocence and purity. On top of that at a deeper level, the film is witty, in that everything ties together and that the audience is forced to think as the movie progresses.The humor is witty as well, in particular the scene about the DMV which is so funny because it's spot on. The witty humor and complex messages make this film enjoyable for everybody, not just kids. Every character in the film is given a great amount of thought and development, making it so that they all have moments to grow, and are extremely relatable. Unfortunately the film's villain has good motivations, however at the end when they reveal who the villain is they come across as campy and over the top.The movie does a great job creating an inventive world where animals from all different habitats can coexist in one city. The film then proceeds to partially waste it's inventive world on various scenes that are plucked straight out of other films, namely the Godfather. However, those scenes are only a small takeaway from the movie as a whole, because they don't last very long and are admittedly clever. That along with the overall maturity the screenwriters used still makes the film a great accomplishment.Zootopia never really looked like a film that would be this good, but after seeing the amazing amount of craft and effort, it seems this may be one of the better animated films of the year. The film does what every animated film should do, it tells a solid story with a lot of emotional depth, and a message that can hopefully teach kids important lessons. The film is also funny, smart, beautifully animated, filled with great characters, and features great voice work. If you have kids, and they haven't seen this film yet, it's safe to say they'd enjoy it, but they may possibly take an important life lesson away from seeing it to.</fullReview>

Her life-long dream is to be a real police officer and to serve with the big bull and bear cops as an equal.

		<fullReview>(RATING: &#x2606;&#x2606;&#x2606;&#x2606;? out of 5) THIS FILM IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. IN BRIEF: A delightfully zany animated jaunt through the detective genre with our four-legged animal friends.GRADE: B+SYNOPSIS: In this world, all animals coexist in perfect harmony and take on stereotypical human traits. This animated buddy cop film introduces an idealistic rookie bunny teaming up with a cynical fox to investigate a series of attacks.JIM'S REVIEW: The evils of prejudice and the need for diversity are the underlying themes in Disney's Zootopia. We view a pastel-colored utopia sans humans where animals are "10% predator, 90% prey". That is until some violence upsets the natural order of things. Which brings Officer Judy Hopps (Ginnifer Goodwin) and con artist Nick Wilde (Jason Bateman) together to solve this whodunit.The film spoofs film noir, detective stories, The Godfather, Breaking Bad, cop films, and other pop references as the duo go about following leads while not-too-subtly handling the message of tolerance and equality. The puns are plentiful in Jared Bush and Phil Johnson's funny screenplay which contrasts this crazy metropolis with our real world. The script uses animal profiling to the nth degree in a most seductive and insightful way which brings about much of the comedy elements.A committee of directors are credited with this film (Bryon Howard, Rich Moore, and, once again, Mr. Bush), so their individual contributions are not readily known, but their end result is seamlessly blended to create a wonderful children's film that seems more skewed for the adults in the audience. The animation is highly detailed and beautifully rendered, creating a satirical universe. The visuals work in unison with a strong narrative, so rare in today's animation which usually panders to sophomoric humor and bad story-telling. Although the filmmakers lay their overly positive message on too thickly and their politics is biased to the obvious liberal left (of which, I firmly concur), this does not interfere with one's full enjoyment of the film's overall wholesomeness and "kumbaya" positive vibe.Ms. Goodwin and Mr. Bateman bring such joy and credibility to their characters. Providing expert voice-overs as well are Idris Elba, J.K. Simmons, Jenny Slate, Tommy Chong (superb as a holistic yak named Yax), Nate Torrance, Bonnie Hunt, Don Lake, Shakira, Octavia Spencer, Alan Tudyk, and Raymond S. Persi as Flash, the slowest sloth clerk at the Department of Motor Vehicles, whose short (and long) bit is the film's laugh-out-loud highlight.Zootopia is the type of film whose main purpose to to entertain and amuse. Yet, it doesn't shy away from some serious issues. This animated film is not afraid to talk about the elephant in the room, even when there is an actual pachyderm in close proximity, which makes it all the more charming and memorable family fare.Visit my blog at: www.dearmoviegoer.comANY COMMENTS: Please contact me at: jadepietro@rcn.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a smart, funny, deeper than you'd expect animated film for adults as much as for kids</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Usually Disney means that it lacks a certain edge or quality that makes it 'safe' or palatable for all audiences. While Zootopia is certainly another big blockbuster for the studio, and especially for the filmmakers and animators who have been behind many of the smash successes of the past 10 years (starting with Meet the Robinsons up through now, when John Lasseter took over), it's not a movie with talking animals something that is dumbed down or has a message that gets obfuscated by too much (dumb) goofball comedy (I'm looking at you, Ice Age and Madagascar sequels). This is actually about something in the same way, not quite up to this level but in the same ballpark, as Watership Down or The Fox and the Hound - though the former is certainly darker than this and the latter a little sweeter and more grounded (much as it can be) in the real world, Zootopia is an excellent example of using animals to convey a message about where we are at today.The film might eschew the current horrors of police brutality (hey, it is ultimately a movie that kids can enjoy, and that might be a lot to take in as far as an animated movie with animals), but it is really impactful about telling a good message about a complicated subject: how does the "melting pot" work? What happens when groups of people - or animals - converge in one city and have to interact with one another? What happens if the thing that separates the animals, acting without the human qualities (or like savage/aggressive beasts) is amplified to create tensions? And what happens when someone who doesn't fit in has the veracity and intelligence and just will-power to rise to the top of something tries to be accepted in a society where he (or in this case also primarily she) doesn't fit in? What I liked in the movie, aside from it having a very clever police procedural plot (which gets in jokes at the expense of The Godfather, which is nothing new but is done with a very funny Don Corleone parody in a tiny rat, and hippie-"nude" yoga-ists), is that it is generally about addressing what it means to be the "other" in a society. It never comes outright and says "it's about racism" point-blank, but it shows it even in something like scale.Some animated films may not pay or draw too much attention to how animals' size differences mark then, but here it's clear from almost the beginning that how small Judy the Bunny is sets her apart from everyone when she's in the city (and likewise how she is bigger than those in the Rodent district, which is a part of Zootopia built for little mice). So it's not hard to see why she is set apart, and yet the movie is more about if you really DO try to make a difference yourself and set yourself apart, you can change things. Maybe. Or you might be looked at as a sly fox your whole life, or a slow sloth. How are you perceived in the world? Though it has a couple of story problems (a story turn two thirds of the way through, which is kind of crammed in to create conflict where it could be handled much better as far as something that separates the two main characters), it's probably my favorite of the recent run of Disney Animated Films productions. And as heavy as I'm making this movie sound it really isn't - it's bright and colorful and the filmmakers have a terrific sense of a whole world that has been built; they could've rested on just one part (the main metropolitan/granite part of the city), but there's so many parts to it that it works for so many possibilities (polar bears, panthers, wolves have their parts of the city) that are seized.It's fresh, clever but also funny, with some excellent performances (Goodwin and Bateman sure, but Elba, Slade and Simmons are very welcome additions with their own personalities), plus it's a cop procedural, and a very good one at that (with a few predictable parts, but it's this kind of movie so I can let it pass).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Everything this movie wants to do, it does and it does properly. Now going into Zootopia I had high expectations, I was still riding the Disney Animation fan bus that had recently impressed me so much with the likes of Big Hero 6 and Wreck it Ralph to name a few. And once again Disney nailed it out of the ballpark. This film follows a bunny working as a police officer in the metropolis of Zootopia, a city where all animals live together in harmony.... and I'll leave it there because this is undeniably a film that rewards you the less you know going into it. As expected, Disney brings forth yet another BEAUTIFULLY animated movie with vibrant colors, distinct environments and smoothly animated sequences that managed to drop my jaw quite a few times. The story is deep without getting caught up in itself and the masterful writing is able to produce so many absolutely hilarious scenes; funny for both adults and children. As well it is able as explore mature topics that are very prevalent in our world today and it does so in a way that is so perfect it conveys its messages flawlessly without becoming dark, or losing its tone. The characters are incredibly well acted, especially from the likes of Jason Bateman as the suave Nick Wilde and Ginnifer Goodwin as Officer Judy Hopps, both of whom have great chemistry with each other making for superb dialogue between the two. Overall this film is so well made, it has a heartwarming, deep story full of laughs, it's animated superbly with great performances from its voice actors and it is definitely worth the watch. Truly up there with the best of Disney's animated movies.</fullReview>

She's the first of her species to became one as other kinds of animals have been one before her but not a fox, though initially one isn't one yet here either. The fox she encounters in Zootopia is in fact someone different than what she's been familiar with before but I'm ahead of myself. I'll just now say that this was quite a funny and inspirational Disney computer-animated movie with a nice message of anyone can be what they want to be if they work hard enough to reach that goal.

My father and I went to see it because we heard it was good, and about 30 min into it we wanted to leave. It was boring. The part that would make the most people laugh was put in the previews to advertise the film. Honestly, my dad and i were at the drive in and by the end of the movie only 2 kids lower than approximately the age of 10 were still awake. (I guess thats why parents liked it so much). It had action, which at some parts would be a little scary for kids, but the whole time the film seemed to be lacking something to make stand out. Personally, My dad even agreed that Frozen was more entertaining and he doesn't like princess movies. The theme of Zootopia is a great one to teach kids though. It touches the topics of bullying and to believe in oneself. If you still want to watch it, i suggest waiting for it to come out on Netflix to save some money.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Animations can be wonderful even when pitched to children. Toy Story 2 is a great movie plain and simple. I don't mean for an animation it's great, it's great as a story. The open act of Up is as moving as any act in any live actor movie as well. Just because these two examples (of many possible) are cartoon figures, doesn't mean they can't have depth and move us. Not so here. We have the same perky female lead we are now having our faces rubbed in time after time. She's weak but takes on all because, by gosh, there are no limitations to what you can do other than in your own head. It's not that I'm opposed to this message, but rather Disney has pushed this out so often that we either get it or don't so let's move on. Isn't there another message possible? Or gee, let's get radical and have a movie that entertains rather than preaches. What a concept!!!So because it's a plucky female lead, we have no tension. We know that she'll come out ahead and better for the experience and the world will be better because she persisted in her remorseless pluck. Underlying all this for, I suppose, the pervs in the audience, there is some sort of odd sexuality and rather uncomfortable suggestions going on. It's a sour note that doesn't offset the saccharine dominant note but rather only adds a nasty undertone to the production. So the same movie with different characters showing that effort aside from CGI doesn't exist or at least it's died entirely in Hollywood.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Overtly propagandistic, but at least they got the name right.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Zootopia is another attempt to propagandize for multiculturalism, coming from the same studio which once produced an uplifting allegory for traditional white identity and aristocracy. In line with the dominant elite view on race, it manages to simultaneously push wild-eyed optimism and a paranoid victim attitude. Considering that it met with very positive critical response, including praise for its political message, the subtitle might as well be This is What Our Elites Actually Believe.As the title implies, the film depicts an unrealistic society inhabited by various animals. The heroine, Judy Hopps, is an effervescent rabbit from a rural area whose parents hope that she will become a carrot farmer like themselves. Their bluntly stated and cartoonish view is that you should not try new things because you might fail. Rejecting this view, Judy aspires to be a police officer, unmoved by their insistence that no bunny has ever held that title. A fox bully assaults her and tells her again of the mismatch between her species and her career aspirations, but she ignores this as well.The multicult message continues when Judy gets ready to leave for Zootopia to begin her law enforcement career. Her parents display excessive concern over her possible future encounters with foxes, offering her fox repellent and even a taser to defend herself with. They remind her of her experience with the fox Gideon Grey who assaulted her years ago, but our heroine recites lines to the effect of "NAXALT" and "some of us are jerks too."Nick then recounts how he consciously decided that if others saw him as untrustworthy, he might as well act that way. Now an adult, he had bragged earlier in the film that he had been running scams every day since the age of 12. There was no mention of previous antisocial tendencies. The accusation that others' rejection can turn an otherwise respectable person into a professional lowlife is of course paranoid, but familiar to anyone who has heard the terms "marginalized" or "stereotype threat." The fox serves as an expression of the external locus of control so common among dysfunctional people.Blaming external racist forces for degeneracy in one's own group should be a familiar concept to American viewers. This plot point is reminiscent of conspiracy theories about the CIA inventing and/or distributing crack cocaine to keep the Black man down, or similar popular theories concerning HIV. The seminal 1944 title An American Dilemma by the Swedish sociologist Gunnar Myrdal accused White prejudices of encouraging low standards of morality among Blacks, which in turn reinforced White prejudices, and so on in a vicious cycle.Of course, today even the implication that there are different standards of morality between races or nationalities would be dismissed as racist. Other than of the victims of the conspiracy, there is no mention in the film of any actual difference in values or behavior between contemporary predators and prey animals.However, the differences between species in Zootopia are dramatic, not only in size and shape but in some aspects of behavior. The sloths who form the staff of the DMV are as slow as actual sloths, even in their speech. There is no pretense of equality in this context; Nick even sarcastically asks Judy if she thinks that someone must be slow just because he is a sloth. Integration of sloths into rabbit or sheep classrooms would obviously be absurd.The film's denunciation of racism is partly based on attempts at humor, which is an appropriate choice for propaganda. Judy praises Nick as "articulate" and he responds by complimenting her on how "non-patronizing" she is, highlighting her "racism." Nick touches the sheep assistant mayor's wool without her knowledge, comically amused by how fluffy it is. Judy reprimands him to the effect that "you can't just touch a sheep's wool." She makes another reference to the racial sensitivities of American Blacks when she explains that a bunny can call another bunny cute, but when another animal does it, it is offensive.The portrayal of "racist" characters is not as vitriolic as social justice warriors might like, but of course still fits with the overall agenda. While some "prejudiced" characters such as the elephant storekeeper and the young Gideon Gray are portrayed as hostile, the racist parents are portrayed as earnest and good-natured yet ignorant. Judy is to some degree portrayed the same way, when she innocently suggests that the basis of the predators going savage might be something in their biology. The results are not harmless though, as she triggers a wave of "xenophobia" against predators. Nick makes a great show of being offended by her racist thoughts, even testing her to confirm that she is in fact afraid of him, and she resigns in shame.Zootopia makes a weak attempt at being less than utopian; Judy's original expectations of a city where everyone gets along are shown to be overly optimistic, which she ultimately admits in a voice-over at the end of the film. The attempts at justifying continued faith in multiculturalism come off as desperate, though. Judy recites slogans such as "real life's a bit more complicated than a slogan," adding that the "glass is half full" and "we all have a lot in common," but she does not sound as though she actually believes it. Of course, no one ever presents any particular reason to believe it; those who do not are simply not presented as reliable sources.The film ends with a scantily clad gazelle performing a degenerate pop song by the Colombian singer Shakira which further highlights the underlying mindset. The lyrics of "Try Everything" celebrate mindless optimism and seem to be intended as a cheap form of therapy for someone who has a crippling fear of failure, reassuring them that "nobody learns without getting it wrong" and "sometimes we come last but we did our best."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was very excited to see Zootopia because I had hear great things about it. Sadly, this movie was a huge disappointment. The theme of accepting people regardless of any preconceived biases is a good lesson, but it could have been done so much better with much more impactful characters. Plus I really don't understand why any of the writers didn't catch that they are basically promoting the idea that when a cop does something, it is okay and justified but if a regular person does it, it is wrong and they should be punished. They joke that the well-known con character in the film (the fox) should be a cop because he is so sly and good at getting information from people. The rabbit even uses the same exact tactics that the fox does, but this is never addressed as being wrong. She breaks into an area where she would like to search (but does not have a warrant), she then says its okay because she has "probable cause." I was waiting for the movie to get to the part where she realizes she is using her badge to break the law and that makes her no better than the "criminals" she deals with. Not to mention, for a film preaching acceptance and not judging people by their appearance, they have some pretty black and white characters (especially their criminals). I don't recommend this to anyone and I don't understand why this movie was even made. Not fun for me, definitely don't see how a kid would enjoy this poorly constructed waste of time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw the trailer a few days ago, and figured it was just another "feel- good" film for little children. But then, everyone started telling me "wow Zootopia was such a good movie!"So I got curious.If you haven't seen the movie yet, I implore you to check it out. This movie came out during a very relevant time for USA. Disney managed to take a hugely complicated, controversial subject and show a way out. Even a young child will understand the message upon viewing. This is truly a masterpiece, and I am in tears from watching it. The cinematography was top notch. The plot and screen writing were great and unexpected (for me). The message rings truer than anything else I've heard. This movie is clearly made by people who care. So take your friend or family to see this film, regardless of his/her age. Zootopia is an important film to watch with an open mind.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I actually found Zootopia way better than Inside out, that suppose to be the big hit after Frozen. I liked the mystery and how cute the animals looked. Which is actually great, as that will help both adults and children enjoy the movie. The dialogues were fast paced and clever, and accompanied the rabbit-fox (the two main characters) greatly. Maybe the gazelle singer thing wasn't good, as it seemed to be added there just to promote Shakira. I mean, as a character she didn't add anything to the plot, she mainly filled the gaps. Finally, I didn't figured out the answer to the case till the end, as the plot was cleverly presented so that it keeps the interest high throughout the movie. So 5 out of 10.</fullReview>

So it keeps it all round entertaining.Zootopia is just kid kid kid all the way. There's nothing wrong with that but there definitely was a few times i was waiting and expecting something with no cheesy or adult one liner.As a kids movie it was great, good story line, good length excellent characters it all played out very well. Would i watch it again nah probably not.Disney have done great in telling the story of a small town tiny nobody so to speak wanting to chase and for fill her dreams. For someone under 12 definitely a good 8 from 10. From me as a 30 something ill give it a 7</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Disney goes back to its anthropomorphic roots, with help from their Pixar brothers of course, to create Zootropolis. Judy Hopps is determined to be the first ever bunny cop and aims to do so by solving a missing persons case along with a sly fox called Nick Wilde. This film is another home run you would expect from the guys at Disney Pixar, a blast for both kids and adults alike.Leaning towards the latter of the two, I can say from an adults point of view this film is really funny and mature. Everything has another meaning and the political satire and statement this film makes is impressive in the run up to the new Trump era (God forbid).What I love about this film is its extremely relevant, mature and real subject matter, with references to immigration, Political cover-ups/ corruption, racism, terrorism, technology and even Breaking Bad. This world, even though animated and inhabited by animals, feels extremely realistic and as if someone has put a mirror up against urban society, revealing the issues hidden under the surface. Zootropolis tells about the people just as Inside Out told about the person.As one would expect, there are a fair share of puns and background Easter eggs to be spotted and for you to laugh (or roll your eyes) at. Everything has been meticulously planned out from Beaver construction workers to Fox conman to Carrot Phones. It's a very very Punny movie but fortunately the film doesn't round off puns like bullets out a machine gun, they are delivered they way they should be, as an occasional one liner. Story drives the film rather than gags which also makes Zootropolis stand out as far as I'm concerned.Zootropolis, Zootopia or whatever else its been renamed for whatever reason, is a another Disney Pixar success. The film speaks to kids and in even greater volume to adults making for a viewing experience that is both fun and entertaining as well as being thought provoking and politically worrying. I would not be surprised if some families leave the theatre with the adults having liking the film more than the kids as the references will fly right over their heads, but at the end of the day it's great to TRY EVERYTHING (Pun intended).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Zootopia is a city where animals, predators and prey ,live together in harmony, where you can be whoever you want, or at least that is what it is supposed to be. Judy Hopps, a bunny from the crops has the dream of becoming a cop and goes to Zootopia. There she meets Nick Wilde, a sly fox that doesn't live under the law. After meeting, they go on a journey to discover the disappearance of an otter and end up discovering a conspiracy bigger than they imagined. This movie blew me away. This is not some silly animated movie. It has a lot to say about prejudice, stereotypes and more. Everyone should go and see Zootopia. The script, the voice work, the action scenes, the emotional scenes (yeah this movie is pretty emotional), the animation are all fantastic. This is one of the best Disney films of all time. The animation is top of the line. Zootopia is far better than i expected it to be. 10/10</fullReview>

It is a very inspirational movie especial for kids. After i did some research into this movie i found out that the animators worked really hard for this movie.They had rabbits in their office to see how they react to anything from there ears to their nose twitching. There are many little references to other movies and shows. this movie is based on our world if humans were never created and the way they did this was very creative.

		<shortDescription>We need more Disney films like this!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In a year full of animated films, a majority of them feature a big cast of animals. Like previously, we had Norm of the North and Kung Fu Panda 3, and we are going to get even more with The Angry Birds movie, Finding Dory, The Secret Life of Pets, Storks, and Sing. But Zootopia is a masterpiece and looks like it's going to win an Oscar. I personally thought it was great. Why is that so? The film has an excellent message about not to judge others despite any limitations. It perfectly brings out this message very deeply. That's not all. The story is highly well crafted through the characters experiences and the twists that come. Many of the scenes are twists that make the story so unpredictable that it surprises you deeply throughout. In fact, the villain (Who I simply can't spoil) gets revealed after several other characters we thought were the villain weren't. These twists are very clever, the message is deep and strong, the humor is hilarious, and this makes perfect writing.The animation is unbelievable. It shows all the parts of Zootopia, the backgrounds are amazing, and the character design is a delight. Remember how The Lego Movie had amazing CGI that surpassed Pixar quality even? Well this is just as great, and looks even better than the special effects of Star Wars: TFA.Also, the characters have so much depth and are very dynamic. Judy Hopps is the perfect role model for people everywhere, not giving up her dreams when bullied by others, and is enthusiastic to "Make the world a better place". Nick Wilde starts off as a jerk, but later has a back story similar to Judy's that develops him, and becomes a good friend. With the exception of a few minor characters, many of the other characters are important, dynamic, and strong. I'm talking characters like Chief Bogo, Mr. Biggs, and more. The villain (Major Spoilers, not going to tell) is clever because it is revealed after many twists and turns. These are just highly unforgettable characters.This is the best animated film I've seen since Toy Story 3 because of it's great writing, outstanding animation, and unforgettable characters. It's even better than Inside Out, and it's the best Disney film I've seen along with Fantasia and The Lion King. It will likely sweep the Oscars due to it's success and will be remembered for a long time. I never thought I would see a modern Disney film that would be a 10/10 for me. So bottom line: Watch it in theaters now, it's a must see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Zootopia has to be one of my favorite, if not, highly rated animated movies of all time! Disney definitely put a lot of effort into making this film, and it's surprising to realize that the film was in development for only 2 years, which is rare for an animated Disney film! The film's characters, voice acting, visual style, heartwarming message about overcoming struggles in life such as prejudice and stereotypes are well-made. The film's main character, rabbit law enforcer Judy Hopps (voiced by Ginnifer Goodwin) has since become known the "anti-Disney Princess" due to her abilities to break the stereotypes found in most Disney heroines and save her city from horrible crimes. Judy becomes Zootopia's first rabbit police officer, but she is told that she has 48 hours solve a case involving several missing animals. Con-artist fox Nick Wilde (voiced by Jason Bateman), who is initially antagonistic towards Judy, eventually becomes her partner, and the two learn to respect each other even though they are considered by others to be natural enemies. The relationship between Judy and Nick stands out as one of the best aspects of the film, and I feel that it will teach viewers a lesson regarding diversity and overcoming prejudice.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is pretty much every Disney movie ever just everyone's an animal and they're racist.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So I saw Zootopia and I wasn't surprised at all. This is another movie released in 2016 that I have very mixed feelings about. This movie was a lot like all of the other Disney/Pixar movies released in the past 10 years. Two characters that don't like each other are forced to go on this adventure by chance, and through this adventure they end up liking each other and becoming the best of friends. I mean really? Another "buddy movie" from Disney that I'm supposed to like because it's Disney. Great. Good. Decent. This is pretty much every Disney movie ever just everyone's an animal and they're racist. Although I wasn't too impressed by the story, I really liked the concept. I thought it did a good job of showing what each species does. Especially because of the sizes of a lot of the animals. Disney put thought into the concept for once (I'm looking at you, Inside Out) I think the concept of this film is great for films and I wish more movies were like this. It's a good concept but not a good fetish. I'll let you think about that since I really don't want to dive into the controversy involving "furries" following this movie.Next up is the characters. I thought the acting for this was really good. Except for the fox. They tried to make him sound like George Clooney, which I guess is acceptable because that's been done in the past? I don't know. But other than that I liked all of the characters in this movie. The one that really stood out for me was Shakira. I mean it's pretty apparent that this character existed only to sell the soundtrack. I did notice one thing about the voice acting though. That no matter what room the characters are in or how far away they are from the camera the audio levels don't change. Trust me. Go see this movie and try to get the image out of your head that these are actors in a room talking into a microphone. I feel like Disney just said "Screw it, they won't notice" since the target audience is kids. And man-children. Save me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A really good film from Walt Disney Animation Studios to come out in 2016 so far</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I will try not to give away too much about this film so on to the review. Zootopia or Zootropolis(as its known here in Ireland)is directed by Byron Howard(who directed my all time favourite Disney movie Tangled)and Rich Moore(who directed Wreck It Ralph)and tells the tale of a young rabbit named Judy Hopps(Ginnfer Goodwin)who dreams of being a cop. But as a kid she got bullied for saving a rabbit's life by a fox who told her she was never going to make it as a cop. Fast forward a few years later and Judy decides to leave her hometown and go to Zootropolis(hence the title of the film). From there she moves into an apartment and does some training at the police force so that she can make it big at the police force. Judy later teams up with a sly fox named Nick Wilde(Jason Bateman)and of course she wants him to help her track down a case as an otter is gone missing and since he is a suspect (since he was the last one to see the otter)its up to the two to track down the otter. But with some strange behaviour going on with the animals? could there be a culprit that is turning all the animals against each other???Bottom line you guys I went to see this yesterday in 3D with my family and to be honest I really really enjoyed this movie. The charcthers are well structured,the animation is very well done,the 3D part though to be fair wasn't that great I preferred the 3D in Kung Fu Panda to be honest as Zootopia hadn't much 3D AT ALL in the screening I went to see yesterday.The story is very done and I thought it was very clever that they used bullying,drugs,racism, stereotypes etc all in the stories scenario. My favourite charcthers have to be Judy and Nick as both of them have the same problems since they were kids(as they were told they weren't good enough to be whatever they wanted to be....you just have to watch the film to get what I am talking about).Shakira makes a cameo too as a famous pop star called Gazelle and she sings the main theme for the film Try Everything(which is litreally stuck in my head since I seen this movie yesterday).If you loved 21 Jump Street,The Godfather,Speed,or any animated films or just a fan of Disney in general than check it out.Best Part: Nick conning the elephant at the ice cream parlour with a tiny animal done up as a baby who is actually not a baby animal at all as he has a grown up voice or the part where the sloths were very slow at the desk. Animation is gorgeous and everything about it was good. Even the villain reveal in the end.The Godfather part cracked me up so hard.Worst Bit; Not worth seeing it in 3D as there isn't much in 3D at all like I have mentioned before.9.5/10 A- 4.5/5Worth watching,excellentPs Keep an ear open for Kirsten Bell who has a one liner as a female sloth called Priscella and Alan Tuduk as the voice of duke of weasleton who is over the pirate DVDS.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disney at its best-Zootopia the Disney fairy tale</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Love it. Let me just be honest and say it is the best Disney movie ever since the lion king in the 90s. The first trailer did not raise much attention although I liked the idea behind the set up. The guys and gals from Disney animation studio did their best in creating such a live and vivid universe where civilized animals live together in harmony. There is reference and hidden easter-eggs everywhere and I recommend you watch some YouTube analysis after seeing the movie if you really liked it.So for a Disney movie to be successful, it has to have three key elements. A lovable leading character, a bad guy and an upbeat theme song. "big hero 6" "frozen" and even "wreck-it ralph" all had it. Zootopia had it all and more. One of the things I personally love about Zootopia is that nobody needs to die to put set the good guy/gal backwards (rest in peace Hiro and parents of Anna and Elsa). I mean, it is good for a twist and all but I wish I can get a good movie without sacrificing anyone. This maybe a bad thing for an Oscar-pursuing movie but it is totally fine with a Disney fairy tale. Zootopia fulfilled my wish. The movie itself just radiates positive energy every scene it goes because, well, it is a fairy tale after all. One of the best scenes I love is when Judy the bunny first arrives in Zootopia and hopping to the beats of the theme song "try everything"(you all seen it in the trailer). It just kept playing over and over after I saw the movie. Judy is such a lovable character that you can easily relate to. You genuinely hope she success in her career and being a Disney production means you know she is going to be. Some may say the plot itself is flawed and no one can reach success so quickly. I would say why not, it is a Disney fairy tale and even in reality this could totally happen. Great plot with little bit twist, amazing voice cast, and stunning picture. Zootopia has all the basics of being a great animation feature film. Another thing Zoopopia aces at is that all its characters who got a line are so vivid. From the police chef "I don't care" Bogo to the typical politician type mayor Lionheart. The main characters aside, I love Mr. Big the most cause he sure is the god father and he never really "iced" anyone, at least not in the movie.For those who rate it 1 star, come on! It is not a documentary, or a sci-fi or even a drama, certainly not a dark comedy aiming to reflect on our society. It is a fairy tale trying to bring you joy and hope and cheer you up. Reality might be cruel and we might lose faith in what we do after a few set-backs. Maybe the next time you are in trouble or feeling the world is against you, tune in "try everything" and picture the first day of Judy in Zootopia, it may not solve your problem but sure will give you the courage to face it.It is going to be a big year for long animation feature films. We got finding dory and the secret life of pets lined up ahead and Zootopia set a real high bar. It is going be great year for animation lovers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another one of a kind film from Walt Disney Animation Studios.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Zootopia tells the story of a bunny named, Judy Hopps(Ginnifer Goodwin). Ever since she was a kid, it has always been Judy's dream to help her fellow animals, by becoming a police officer. In the world of Zootopia, humans never happened. Thousands of years ago, animals used to be savages, with predators hunting for their prey &amp; the prey relying on their natural instinct to survive. Then, the civilized society was born. Predators &amp; prey, learned to peacefully co-exist. Zootopia is a city where all the anthropomorphic animals live together. There are various small towns near Zootopia, that are inhabited by one particular species. Judy Hopps goes to Zootopia to pursue her dream, of becoming a cop. After all the required exams &amp; field exercises, Judy finally becomes the first rabbit ever, to become a cop. While on the job, Officer Hopps soon realizes that being a cop is not exactly as dignified &amp; rewarding, as she thought it would be. She finally gets an opportunity to prove her mettle as a police officer. Along with the help of a wily fox named Nick Wilde(Jason Bateman), Judy goes about solving this mystery. While on the job, Judy &amp; Nick unearth a diabolical conspiracy, that will affect the entire society. Zootopia is a great movie! The animation is otherworldly. The city of Zootopia looks really authentic, &amp; feels like a city that any anthropomorphic animal would flock to, for greener pastures. All the small towns around Zootopia, are gorgeous. I especially loved the rain forests. The 3D immerses the viewer, right in the middle of this beautiful world. Although this movie is wonderful, it doesn't reach the pinnacle of perfection like other recent Disney animated movies like, Wreck-It Ralph(2012) &amp; Big Hero 6(2014). The various set pieces throughout the movie, are highly engaging &amp; will keep you on the edge of your seat. Kids &amp; adults will love this movie. There is a ton of heart in the film. However, one recipe missing from this movie, that make all Disney animated movies flawless, is humor. There are hardly any comedic set pieces in the movie. Even when there are, these jokes are mainly meant only for children. The sloth gag is funny at first but, it gets tedious really fast. This is a very minor flaw though. This movie is as unique as all the other Walt Disney Animation Studios &amp; Pixar movies, to date. The highlight of the film is the suspense. This is the first animated film, that has a major mystery element throughout. The voice acting is spot on. Ginnifer Goodwin is spectacular as Judy Hopps. Jason Bateman is outstanding as Nick Wilde. Idris Elba is perfect as Chief Bogo. Jenny Slate is amazing as Bellwether. Nate Torrence is awesome as Clawhauser. Bonnie Hunt &amp; Don Lake are good as, Bonnie Hopps &amp; Stu Hopps, respectively. Tommy Chong is hilarious as Yax. J.K. Simmons is superb as Mayor Lionheart. Octavia Spencer is great as Mrs. Otterton. Alan Tudyk, Shakira, Raymond S. Persi &amp; Della Saba are impressive as, Duke Weaselton, Gazelle, Flash &amp; Young Hopps, respectively. Maurice LaMarche is effective as Mr. Big. Zootopia is a must watch, with your whole family.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dark, Edgy, Clever, Fun: Hard to Find Fault With Zootopia</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It seems that Disney studios continues to partake in a civil war between their two animation companies. Today Walt Disney Animation studios' puts out another work entitled Zootopia, to attempt to add another Oscar worthy film to their ranks. With all the hype and build up, I looked forward to being entertained by another masterpiece from their studio. Yet the question "Is it worth the trip to theater?" may be ringing through your ears. So once again I'm going to give you my input and help you decide the answer to that question. Therefore?let's get to it. Like every Disney movie you can bet that the animation is excellent, and Zootopia is no exception. The cast of anthropomorphized animals fluidly moves about the screen in a human like manner as they live their lives throughout the fictional city, capturing the grace and dexterity of the homo sapiens they are modeled after. Even more impressive is seeing our animals in the primal state, as their anatomy is fully captured in spectacular detail. But animation is only one part of the magic of Zootopia. The design of the world is amazing, a perfect blend of modernized civilization and animal ecosystems. Zootpia's residential sections emphasize certain architectural styles that personify the particular mood of the area (e.g. Icy cold tundra as a front for the Mafia or the serene yet wild energy of the jungle villas.) All these details were brilliantly colored and shaded, bringing out the emotion of each scene, but still maintaining the whimsical nature of a Disney film. While I didn't see the movie in 3-D, I can certainly see this beautiful world being further stunning. While the design of the movie is enough to pull you into the theater let's talk about the story and comedy of the movie next. Disney always has the quirky, unique ideas that manage to imprint on our minds and make us fall in love with it. For Zootopia that main story is a mystery centered on disappearing animals across the city. This mystery established the suspense of the story, keeping me intrigued throughout the tale as to how deep the "rabbit" hole went. The genius of the movie though is bringing two other stories into the fold and integrating them into the plot. These plots are character-developing moments that give our characters depth to latch onto. Much of these themes are tied to some big moral dilemmas that are very relevant today such as racism, feminism, and duty. And just like many of their movies, Zootopia takes at stab at teaching us how to properly handle these situations (shame on you Disney for teaching us!). Regardless whether you learn something or not, Zootopia is an emotionally deep tale that has many levels for all ages to enjoy and perhaps make you tear up in the process. As for the comedy, Zootopia trades in the stupid for a more clever and cute approach. Fans of the DMV will get plenty of witty jabs at some modern trends that include obsession with phones, scamming the system, and plenty of TV references for the media obsessed. Well-timed one-liners and comedic delivery by our voice actors keeps the comedy fun and fresh and had me (and a few other audience members) laughing throughout the film. I didn't notice many kids laughing throughout the movie, most likely due to the lack of the childish humor. Plus side, less repeating of quotes and sounds during the movie. Negative side, they might not be as interested in the movie. Regardless, I certainly enjoyed the writers' wittiness in this film and the fun energy they injected with their comedy without diverging from the theme of the movie. Now lets hit the weaknesses of the film. One thing I was disappointed with was how much of the movie I had seen from the trailers. Disney showed a lot of the funny parts numerous times and felt their effects had waned by then. In addition I felt some of the scenes were not as well done as the trailers had built them up to be, and kind of lackluster compared to the trailer counterparts (such as the naturalist scene). These moments felt unnecessary and barely relevant to the plot and could have been vamped up a bit. In addition I was hoping that the plot twist was a little better executed instead of dropping big hints to give it away. A few other minor complaints include: some overdone comedic ploys and some preachy moments that had me rolling my eyes. Disney once again hits a home run with their animated films. The design of alone is impressive, but the movie is incredibly fun, clever, and has the energy you love. Sure it may not be a film that will keep your kids squealing in laughter, but Zootopia brings many aspects to the silver screen that I think all ages will love. I fully support going to see this movie in theaters and hope you will enjoy the film as much as I did. My scores for Zootopia are: Animation/Action/Adventure: 8.5Movie Overall: 8.0</fullReview>

		<fullReview>2016 has been a so-so year in film thus far. Sure, it's only the beginning of March, but there hasn't really been that knock out film to this point. I enjoyed The Finest Hours and Eddie the Eagle for what they were, but besides perhaps Deadpool, no movie has really been worth seeing more than once. Zootopia absolutely is that film for me. It's the next installment in Disney Animation Studio's resurgence of greatness and it can be enjoyed by everyone. It may be Disney's most colorful film to date, for a few reasons, but it also has the classic Disney moral message for viewers of all ages and backgrounds.Zootopia takes place in a world where there are no humans and animals do everything as if they are humans. They have houses, police forces, and access to our type of transportation. Basically, this is the one film in Disney's canon where fans can't really make the theories that it takes place within the same universe as all of the other films. With that said, I loved the world building that Zootopia was able to establish. In many ways, this is the film I can see Disney making sequels to for several years to come. The characters are well realized and there are plenty of potential directions they can take the story.Right from the opening scene I found myself attached the adorable, Judy Hopps, a bunny who dreams of becoming the first of her species to become a cop. Zootopia takes on many of the unfortunate tropes of our real world but the one most identifiable is discrimination and segregation. So of course Hopps is naturally not taken seriously as a determined officer of the law. The self-referential nature of the film doesn't stop there but I don't think it ever jumps the shark. As noticeable as some of the discrimination and prejudices can be when pointed out by several characters, it ends of serving as a good message to not judge or underestimate people's determinations and dreams.On the lighter side, Zootopia is one of the cleverest Disney films to come out in recent memory. Its constant nods to pop culture including famous films like The Godfather or TV shows like Breaking Bad give the parents more than enough reason to take their kids to the theater. There are plenty of jokes that will fly over kids heads and the humor never gets too silly. It's a great balance that makes an animated kids films so great, and Zootopia is a good example of that.More than anything, it's worth seeing for its fun characters and inspiring message. The voice talent is as good as it has been for Disney in a long time as Jason Bateman, Ginnifer Goodwin, Idris Elba, Jenny Slate, and J.K. Simmons all do a wonderful job bringing these characters to life. You will get attached to Hopps and her unlikely fox friend, Nick Wilde as they go on a journey to uncover a conspiracy that is plaguing Zootopia. Which brings up another brilliant aspect of this film which is its meticulous plot. Near the end some moments felt contrived and perhaps too far-fetched, but when you have enjoyed a film to the extent to which I had enjoyed Zootopia to that point, it didn't really bother me.When an animated Disney film manages to bring to life several new and exciting characters while also implanting an intricate crime story in between, you know you have a gem on your hands. Zootopia may not be as memorable as some of the greatest Pixar films (hey what films are?) but it does have its fair share of thought provoking moments and endlessly re-watchable funny gags. A clever script and a thought provoking message makes Zootopia the best 2016 film to date thus far.+Voice cast+Well-realized world+Something for everyone+Likeable characters you can't help but root for+Pop culture references+Thought provoking message-Some moments felt contrived towards the end9.4/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Overall the message is a positive one. Problems arise when we begin to explore the message from a more granular perspective.Zootopia is an animal utopia. That's a relatively straightforward naming convention. What exactly is an animal? What exactly is a utopia?To answer the first question we can look at the phylogenetic tree (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phylogenetic_tree) to see how our current system of classification places our animal ancestry. (If you disagree with this system of classification please help to make it better by pursuing studies in some form of biological science.) Animals appear to appear somewhere around 2500 to 1000 million years ago* and have given rise to the plethora of forms seen in Zootopia as well as other forms unseen**.The second question, that of utopia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utopia), has a mixed history. Quite possibly the history of the meaning of the word is as diverse as the thought-processes of the animals that imagined the word. An article in an encyclopaedia can only give us so much of a definition; a foundation on which to build. Utopia, in my mind, brings up the concept of a dystopia. Do we currently live in a dystopia? Are there pockets of utopia and dystopia? Is my utopia another's dystopia? Ignoring my atopian ramblings, a utopia has as one of its primary parameters an implicit agreement between all involved that this particular environment is the the plateau of social dynamics; there is no improvement that can be made and any change will diminish the experience. Zootopia is not a utopia. This is evident in the fact that there are disagreements about who can be what within the Zootopian society. Zootopia is clearly intended to be a mirror on human society.So, what does Zootopia ask us to question about human society? Primarily difference. How do we hold back our fellow humans through the nurturing environment we call society***? Zootopia looks at the mutability of social status. A rabbit can become a cop. This is unheard of until the days portrayed in the movie. The struggle begins in the family. Mom and dad are worried for their daughter's well-being in a world that doesn't like change. Mom a dad don't like change. Daughter doesn't see it as change; just that she wants to be something that already exists in her world.In training rabbit finds and overcomes more than one barrier. These barriers exist because society has not recognized them as barriers simply because no-one that these barriers exist for has ever come forward to attempt to move past the barriers. This is complicated. Testing for barriers requires either a vast imagination to think of all possible combinations of situations or requires members of society to bump into those barriers. In the bumping, slamming, or general feeling out of societal barriers how many members have to undergo this "feeling out" to elicit a change in the hardware of society? From Zootopia, how many rabbits have to jump onto a too-tall commode and fall in before commode height is changed? Additional questions like these come up when rabbit finds herself assigned to meter-maid duty instead of detective work. She does the best she can in a menial task. Is there an ethical imperative to do the best you can at a menial task? Zootopia doesn't explore this.Eventually our heroine, a rabbit, is placed in the spotlight of greatness and flubs it up by placing the emphasis of Zootopia's current criminal activity on the nature framework (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature_versus_nurture#Genomics); in this case the division between predators and prey; a division that has been overcome to the point of a societal revulsion (taboo) against primal animal tendencies. Our heroine doesn't see the harm in her comments and thereby propels herself into a political fight that ousts the current mayor (a predator) and breaks her friendship with the fox. She has to rebuild her relationships.In the end it all works out. Animals are just living their lives. The rabbit, through hard work, finds her place in society and the society, through several hundred thousand years of inertia continues the slow grind to the next moment.Things you can participate with me in being bothered about:The concept of a predator no longer being a predator. What do predators eat in Zootopia?There is a clearly a crime syndicate run by moles. They ice people. Is this more acceptable than "going primal"?How does society change? How do we examine barriers to others? How do we imagine barriers that don't exist today, but will certainly exist tomorrow? How do we get ourselves and others to act on eliminating those barriers when only one person or very few people are affected by the barriers that exist? How low can barriers be made if they must exist at all?*Though today's DNA techniques are only useful on DNA up to 1 million years old. **What would the movie have been like if humans had been thrown into the mix? We are, after all, animals not that far removed from all of the others. And what about insects? ***I use nurture atypically here. It simply means the environmental milieu through which we are born, subjected to, and die.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes, it's a Disney movie about talking animals. And yes, it's deservedly kicking butt at the global box office.Judy Hopps (voiced by Ginnifer Goodwin) is a rabbit from an idyllic rural community. Her risk-evasive parents just want her to be a farmer, but Hopps has bigger ideas. She's heading to Zootropolis to chase her dream of being a cop. While on traffic duty she meets Nick Wilde (Jason Bateman), a sly fox skilled in the ways of the hustle. When Hopps lucks into a missing person case, she teams up with Wilde to uncover the mystery. It's bigger than they thought. Turns out predators are regressing to their aggressive primal state, frothing and speechless; and there's a cover-up which goes right to the top. Fox and bunny must work together to solve the case.The "Zootopia" of the (better) US title refers to Hopps' belief that the city is a place of infinite diversity and complete harmony. To quote the Hail, Caesar!: Would that it were so simple. Zootropolis is a place of tensions and prejudices between its animal citizens. One of those prejudices is carried by Hopps herself: she carries fox repellent spray wherever she goes. There's the first Big Theme of the movie: entrenched assumptions about the dangerous otherness of others.The city itself is split into clear sections ? desert, ice, jungle etc ? like a Super Mario Bros map. It makes for a nonsensical but utterly beautiful environment. It's populated by all manner of creatures great and small. The movie directly addresses Disney's historic fascination with anthropomorphising beasts. There's even a slightly awkward visual acknowledgement of cartoon animals' lack of genitalia.For a feature cartoon we get an unusually coherent plot, channelling some enjoyable buddy cop and detective thriller tropes. And the script delivers mercifully few ironic, immersion-breaking wisecracks.Caricatures abound, of course, but Hopps and Wilde are nicely sketched characters whose backstories of being bullied mirror each other's. They also mirror the broader social issues the film addresses.This is a timely film, what with Mr Trump sowing the seeds of fear and hatred and appealing to base rage as a release valve. Zootropolis's final manifesto is unapologetically liberal: one of finding common ground as a way of accommodating diversity. We are evolved, it says, so that we might seek an alternative to resolving difference through our most basic animal instincts. Existence precedes essence, not the other way around.Hopps gets a Big Speech at the end where she spells out the themes and moral messages of the film, just in case they went over the heads of younger viewers ? or possibly adults who genuinely believe what they've seen is 'just for kids'.So, while a barrel of fun and full of jokes (many of them visual, rewarding repeated viewings), this is a surprisingly thoughtful and sober film. It has its fair share of slapstick, but isn't stuffed with interminable action sequences. We definitely don't get the Marvelisation that almost spoiled Big Hero 6 in the final act. The big and clever showdown here is resolved through the use of imagination; and imagination is the key to empathy; and empathy is the key to a tolerant society. Nice writing.Inside Out was about human consciousness. Zootropolis is all about social conscience. Maybe it doesn't hit the heights of Pixar's masterpiece, but it wouldn't look out of place in the filmography of that lauded studio. Zootropolis may be a struggle for very young ones, but it is consistently entertaining and valuable viewing for smart nippers and adults alike.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The opposite of unpleasant... Pleasant.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1992, cartoonist Art Spiegelman won the Pulitzer Prize for Maus, which appropriated cuddly, anthropomorphic animals (not at all unlike Disney creatures) for a parable about racism, discrimination, and survival, circa WWII. Flash-forward 24 years, and we finally have Disney's rebuttal. And those years have been good to the House of Mouse, now enough of a franchise super-giant to fire off quirky B-tier flicks like Zootopia, confident enough to surpass Disney's usual standard of impeccable visuals and emotional storytelling to also really be About Something. Zootopia is razor-sharp, outrageously clever, bustling with urgent thematic subtext, and heartfelt enough to reach the realm of Disney classics sure to be heralded as essential canonical viewing for generations of children and adults henceforth.Following (the vastly inferior) The Good Dinosaur as the second consecutive Disney release championing a thriving societal infrastructure where humans don't exist (hmm...), Zootopia is a dazzlingly dense and textured realm almost too detailed to take in at first glance, forcing cinema viewers to acclimatize to the consistent unrequited urge to pause and contemplate. When our protagonist, earnest Officer Hopps (magnificently emotive, infectiously giddy Ginnifer Goodwin), arrives at Zootopia, the film is content to momentarily become a travelogue, drinking in, in a sweeping pan shot, the regions, and size/species/climate sub-communities of the city. Don't worry, though - we'll get to revisit them all later). Before you can think of a better pun than "face the yaks", Zootopia has transformed into a buddy (or should I say BUNNY - I thought of one!) cop mystery adventure. As Hopps pairs with irrepressible con-fox Nick Wilde (Jason Bateman at his most laconic, smugly hilarious), they dive into a romp full of hilarity, exhilarating sequences (including a slew of chases/tussles highlighting the unique physicality of each animal present), and thematic mediation on xenophobia, ideology, and societal power hierarchies. Y'know - kid stuff.Zootopia isn't subtle about being just as issue-driven as story-driven, but nor should it be. Here, the parable of civilized mammals 'going savage' (an interesting contribution to the nature/nurture debate in itself) serves as the perfect catalyst to ignite age-old discriminatory tensions between tenuously co-habitating predator and prey (including some genuinely upsetting sequences), in a fashion perfectly suited to contextualize privilege, racism, and wage and influence-gaps to children - heck, even for adults. But in case that gets too heavy (and Zootopia, while jaunty and fast-paced, has its fair share of vintage Disney darkness), it's tempered with some on-point one- liners to snarkily soften the blow ("a bunny can call another bunny cute, but you can't"/"you can't just touch a sheep's wool!!"), with only the occasional clunky line reeking of kid-friendly rewrites to distract from the revelry. For the kids, there are more Frozen and other Disney nods than you can count (including a genius Alan Tudyk cameo I'll weasel out of spoiling here). For the adults: inspired nudist colony gags, and riffs on the Godfather and Breaking Bad. And yes: that sloth DMV scene is just as funny in theatres as in the umpteen trailers you've seen it in. Trust me.Still, amidst all the ideas, heart, and cutting dialogue, the voice cast are what really hit home. Apart from the superb Goodwin and Bateman, who share delightfully sparky, and sometimes surprisingly emotional banter, the distinctive boom of Idris Elba and bark of J.K. Simmons lend welcome support, while Jenny Slate mumbles so many (yup, I'm going there) sheepish witticisms in the background she's almost worth a second viewing singlehandedly.Zootopia doesn't quite hit the soaring, transcendent emotional heights associated with classic Lion King/Beauty and the Beast era Disney (though many of its smaller moments are just as poignant and well-orchestrated in their own way), as it's really its own (guffaw) animal. But, as a snappier, more expansive, socially conscious cousin, it's still an essential addition to the Disney family, and one that almost insists upon revisiting, if only to properly do justice to. Rich, vibrant, and clever enough to make audiences young and old (night)howl with laughter, Zootopia is the confident work of a peerless studio operating at the top of their game, and necessary viewing as cinema, far surpassing mere animated entertainment.Now, if you'll excuse me, I'll be off trying to beat that stupidly catchy Shakira chorus out of my head. I moose be rid of it; I can bearly stand it!(...I really otter stop now. But rhino want to. I'd say it's an ox-ident, but you're a shrew-d reader, and I know you wouldn't take that lion down.)-9.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Zootopia (2016): Dir: Byron Howard, Rich Moore, Jared Bush / Voices: Ginnifer Goodwin, Jason Bateman, Idris Elba, Jenny Slate, Nate Torrence: Fascinating and creative take on animals within a human society where they co-exist as one while interacting in a human like lifestyle. Judy Hopps is a bunny with big dreams. She desires to venture to Zootopia to become the first ever bunny recruit cop. She succeeds despite obstacles but is given the task of meter maid. Central plot regards missing predators and a conspiracy that regards them returning to their wild savage old lifestyles. Hopps is joined in her search by Nick Wilde, a con artist fox who reluctantly assists Hopps when she catches him within his own scam. There are animals abound every frame from biggest to smallest. Chief Bogo is a cape buffalo who barks orders and gives Hopps only a small amount of time to crack this case. There is the lion mayor and the lamb secretary, which makes for a great play on the opposite ends of the hunting scale that is non-existent in this culture. It is never clear what the predators eat but we do have an overweight cat at the front desk at the police station who knows where the donuts are. The animation is colorful and full of life and personality but the real surprise is a screenplay that is both entertaining for children while being extremely clever in terms of plot devices. The theme is tolerance and how we need to learn to accept others despite their faults just as Hopps learns when she must put away the fox repellant and just view Nick as another living creature with hopes and dreams.

		<fullReview>When Disney Animation Studios releases a new picture, it is almost guaranteed to gain an outstanding receipt at the box office. Disney has managed to come with many great surprises over the last six decades, and although there have been a few disappointments every now and then, they have proved to have effective standards on gaining the attention of audiences everywhere. In this new Disney animated picture, Ginnifer Goodwin does the voice of Judi Hopps, a bunny with the dreams of becoming the first bunny to be a cop instead of settling with a typical bunny job of farming carrots, much to the doubt of every other animals in the world. Standing against all odds, she makes it through the police academy and wins position as a cop in the police department headed by a rhino Chief Bogo (voiced by Idris Alba) of Zootopia, a city where all animal types, predator and prey, get along well. When a case of fourteen missing otters comes up, Judi steps up and volunteers for the case and is given 48 hours to crack the case with the help of a con artist fox named Nick (voiced by Jason Bateman). Featuring a supporting cast of Jenny Slate, Nate Torrence, Bonnie Hunt, J.K Simmons, Don Lake, Octavia Spencer, Shakira, and many others; this animated picture brings solid laughter to please kids and adults alike while conveying its deep crucial message that resonates with the issues that go on in our society today.I was utterly surprised by how much I enjoyed this movie. It took me by a surprise on many levels. While it succeeds on bringing decent family-friendly laughter and eye-popping state-of-the-art animation that shows how far we have come along with technology with recent years, one of the most surprising aspects comes from its political message about society and the issues that America struggles with today. One of which is racism. As the story follows a bunny who pursues her dreams of becoming a police officer while battling the doubt of many who believe bunnies are too small and weak to survive as cops, it underlines an example of how racism and prejudice still affects our society. And as the film progresses, it digs deeper and deeper into this theme and the message grew more powerful, giving the story a more intellectual feel while still entertaining the audiences with its light-hearted humor. And the movie balances this so well that to where it can appeal to both adults, children, and even teens alike. While kids may not pick up on its message and just shrug off depending on their age, they will nonetheless find joy and laughter at the uplifting story and outgoing humor. Yes, there are a few jokes that only adults will pick up on, but plenty of kids jokes are thrown out here as well. Ginnifer Goodwin and Jason Bateman are both fantastic as the two main characters, the same goes for Idris Alba as the rhino who at first has doubts for Judi serving for the police department for the small little bunny she is. The film also has a message about not giving up and following your dreams regardless of what people tell you, and I think that is an important message kids will to come learn. Zootopia is by far one of the best animated features I have seen in a long time, and one every family should go see. It is very funny, very original, and astoundingly entertaining on many levels. And it is pretty safe to say this movie could make a contender for the Best Animated Picture at the Oscars. I strongly encourage everyone to go see this!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cool new world, interesting story ... good for kids and maybe adults too</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Full disclosure: I'm an adult who generally likes action and sci-fi movies. I'll go for an animated movie if I it has great reviews and people say it's enjoyable for "all ages". That was the case here and - yes, I found it entertaining.It's basically a story about evolved animals that live in a harmonious, modern-age city called "Zootopia". It's "harmonious" because predators and prey live and work together without stereotypes and labels. Well -- that's what everyone wants to believe, but reality is a bit more messy. This is what a young female bunny named Judy learns when she pursues her dream to become a police officer. She also stumbles onto a mysterious case ... and things get interesting.It may sound a bit corny and adolescent, but the story and themes aren't. It's well-written with clever dialog, an engaging plot mystery and likable characters. Plus, "Zootopia" is like this big world with different zones or habitats for different types of animal species. It's a pretty cool concept in itself.The only thing I didn't like is that much of film's environments are too dark (visually) with gloomy skies and a general lack of vibrant colors. Better background color contrast would have been nice too. I'm going to guess this was a stylistic call to highlight something about the story -- but I don't think it was worth it.Anyhow, that notwithstanding, I'd say this is a great movie for kids - lots of action, fun characters and nice variety of visual locations and props. For the adults: if you enjoy movies like Shrek and the Lego Movie, you might enjoy this movie. It has less wit than those movies, but still has a lot of fun dialog and a good timely story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An atypical Disney studio animation comes out in March, ZOOTOPIA is a spunkily crowd-pleasing roller-coaster of gags, fun and wisdom, expediently taps into the anthropomorphic mammal fauna as a mirror of our own society, where the minority of predators is persecuted for their brutal nature which is designed by their DNAs, is it right to sacrifice the rights of a minority party just to ensure that a majority preys will feel safer? This is the lesson every kid (sometimes, the adults too) who is watching this picture should learn, so it is enormously pleasing to see Disney is judicious enough to be the torchbearer, to instill the notion of a harmonious society with co-existing diversity to children is an immeasurable deed can benefit future generations and promise a brighter future.Our protagonist is the rabbit Judy Hopps (Goodwin), who is determined to be the first bunny cop in the police force, against all odds, she makes it and starts to work in Zootopia. In spite of being belittled by her boss Chef Bogo (Elba), Judy befriends with a con artist, the fox Nick Wilde (Bateman), together they must solve a mysterious case of missing predators. Then, an ostensible triumph prompts Judy's politically uncorrected speech, which inadvertently incites the mass hostility towards the predators, so eventually, it is down to Judy and Nick to debunk a conspiracy theory carried out by the meekest species.The plot thickens halfway through, which indicates the story has more affinity to a Pixar-esque criterion than a common lower-age-aiming pap, and up to the segment where Judy apologises to Nick for her blunder, the film pulls off a fairly emotional catharsis, then rounds off with a bromide to reveal the (till that point) unsurprising culprit.The technical work is certainly above-par, Oscar-worthy to say the least. A ream of unorthodox characters, running the gamut from the limelight-stealing DMV officer sloth Flash to a rip-roaring Mr. Big pays homage to THE GODFATHER franchise, contradictions galore, but never overstay their welcome. So it is fairly safe to predict ZOOTOPIA will be a strong contender for next year's golden statute and Disney does elevate the bar for other studios to emulate, two thumbs up!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow, this one surprised me. I saw the early trailers for this movie and had extremely low expectations for this movie, expecting to just be another awful March movie. However, when I saw that it then had a 98% on Rotten Tomatoes, I decided to go see it. Well, I was wrong to judge it so early just based on the trailer. This movie was absolutely brilliant. It had more to say on relevant issues than a vast majority of adult live-action movies do, and it still found a way to do so in a clever and not overbearing way. The plot, while formulaic, was still interesting and the message and humor more than made up for the relative unoriginality of the plot. The characters in this movie were also rather cliché, but the movie used that nicely to make many points about stereotyping so that can't be used as a negative. This is a must-see for both kids and adults, the best true "family" movie in years.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Funny, heartfelt, creative, and teaching a strong lesson in prejudice, Zootopia roars as one of Disney's strongest films.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When one thinks of animation, walking and talking animals come to mind. Even at the start of animation, characters like Mickey Mouse and Felix the Cat were human-like animals that were the stars of the genre as they could speak to everyone and still be as entertaining as any human. Warner Brothers has the Looney Tunes, which is full of anthropomorphic animal-characters that perform vaudeville routines like a regular human comedian. MGM has Tom and Jerry, the ultimate battle to the death as a cat and mouse should, yet still make their slapstick comedy relatable enough for people to connect with. Now Disney has an interesting note with walking, talking animals.Despite having a mascot that's anthropomorphic, Disney haven't made much content with human- like animals. 101 Dalmatians, Lady and the Tramp and The Jungle Book has such creatures, but live in a world full of people that are the dominant species. In the case of an entire world of animals, I can only think of Robin Hood (which I really like) and Chicken Little (which I consider one of Disney's worst) that have pulled that off. Zootopia takes that same idea, but really takes advantage of the environment it creates to create something really unique.Judy Hopps (played by Ginnifer Goodwin) is a bunny who has always wanted to be a cop. She's constantly told by everyone, even her parents, that bunnies cannot be police officers due to their size and cute look. She proves them wrong and passes the police academy first in her class and a position in the metropolis of Zootopia. Though promised that she would receive the same treatment like her fellow officers, her police captain Chief Bogo (played by Idris Elba) assigns her parking duty. Rather then complain, she takes her new assignment with excitement, hoping her work effort will lead to something better. After arresting a thieving weasel, she given a chance to find a missing otter within forty-eight hours or risk having to resign. The only clue she has is a photo from where Emmet Otterton was last seen. She finds a clue that leads her to a sly, con artist fox Nick Wilde (played by Jason Bateman). Though she has a prejudice against foxes (due to her past), they team up to find the otter. Their various clues take them to a nudist club run by a Yak (played by Tommy Chong), a DMV run by sloths, and even a crime boss shrew named Mr. Big in order to discover the bigger mystery within the city.When I heard about Zootopia, I wasn't sure if more could be offered to the anthropomorphic animal setting. I was not only proved wrong, but this blew me away. The folks at Disney should be city designers as Zootopia feels like a legitimate city with it's various sections. From the desert to the tundra and even a section for rodents, the city could rank up with Los Angeles in Blade Runner or Gotham in Batman. I'll be surprised if something from this movie is not incorporated into the Disney Parks.The voice acting is simply perfect with Ginnifer Goodwin and Jason Bateman as a good set of buddies in this cop story. Speaking of mysteries, the case to be solved was very intriguing and manages to pull off a moral that's perfect with the recent news stories of racism and gender discrimination. I assume that Disney had wanted to tell a story on racism and prejudice for a while and Zootopia should get the adults to think while keeping the children entertained with some great slapstick that remains fast and essential to the plot.I'll give this ten Nick Wildes out of ten. While Frozen may have been the major Disney movie that people wouldn't stop talking about, Zootopia has a chance to divert that attention as it already has for me. I highly recommend this for everyone, especially for adults, even if they claim they don't like animation.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disney Animation's Best In A Long Time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's no denying that Disney Animation Studios' output in current years has been hit or miss, with Disney's best animated features being those helmed by Pixar. I am happy to report that Zootopia can stand toe-to-toe with most of Pixar's films. It starts with a great script. This script is funny, very funny. But it is also relatable, heartfelt and timely. There has been much discussion and praise of the films messages of embracing diversity and not giving up on one's dreams. While that latter message is a common theme in most family fare, the points the film makes about diversity couldn't be coming along at a better time. Many of us watch the news and see the stories of unarmed minorities being harmed or killed by police officers, or protests over the Oscars' lack of nominee diversity, and we realize there is truth and relevance to many of these issues. But how often do we stop to think about how our kids are responding to these things? They often watch, read and hear the same news we do. The main theme of Zootopia is not judging others based on their "species" and avoiding common misconceptions and stereotypes about anyone who may not come from the same origins you do. Admittedly, the movie beats this point more than a dirty rug (a skunk-butt-rug perhaps? You'll see.). But it doesn't interfere at all with the movie's enjoyment factor. Aside from an extremely witty script, we have a well-cast group of actors bringing life to a plethora of unique new characters. In the lead is Ginnifer Goodwin as Judy Hopps, Zootopia's first bunny cop. One thing that set Disney's classics apart was their creation of unique and memorable characters. Think Genie from Aladdin, Dopey from Snow White, the White Rabbit from Alice In Wonderland or Timon &amp; Pumba from The Lion King-characters that have thrived in the pop culture ether long after their movies' releases. Judy Hopps is one of Disney's best new characters in years and she deserves to be every bit as memorable as those others I mentioned. She could have thrived on the cute factor alone, but she is much more three-dimensional than that. She has experienced real bullying and prejudice in her life but insists on enduring through whatever others throw at her so she can become a cop and "make the world a better place". She's clever, funny and even a little flawed, making her easy to connect with and root for. Jason Bateman costars as the sly fox Nick Wilde, who must learn throughout the film to look past his cynical view of the world and his own selfish attitude. As a Jason Bateman fan, I was glad to see him lending his famously sarcastic tone to this project. In his character's first few scenes I wasn't sure he was the right fit, but once Wilde and Hopps partner up, his range kicks in as his character faces a new emotional journey. The supporting cast includes Idris Elba, Bonnie Hunt, Tommy Chong, J.K. Simmons, Octavia Spencer, Alan Tudyk, Maurice Lamarche, Jenny Slate and Shakira as a pop star named Gazelle who treats us to a fun concert during the end credits. Nate Terrance gets one of the film's best supporting roles as Clawhauser, the police department's front desk officer-a fat, goofy, over-the-top, donut-loving cheetah. He and Judy get one of the best scenes in the movie when he uses a certain word to describe her and she responds with a friendly "only bunnies can use that word" attitude. It is obvious what real world scenario this scene is mirroring, and it is a very clever part of the movie's diversity message. All these characters are part of the movie's great mystery-why has there been a disappearance of multiple mammals, and why, in an evolved society where all animals live in supposed harmony, are some animals turning "savage" and attacking others? I certainly won't spoil it here; and while the big reveal may be a tad predictable, it fits the film well. The pacing is near perfect, never does the movie feel like it's dragging or rushed. The sloths at the DMV scene featured in the film's second trailer is probably the funniest scene in the movie. However, there is a little more to it and even though I had already seen it multiple times, it still brought me to tears laughing in the theater. Thankfully, there's plenty more great lines and gags throughout to keep the laughs coming. Obviously, with any animated feature, the quality of the animation is an important factor. Zootopia looks great. It may not be jaw-dropping like The Good Dinosaur, but all the images are well drawn and crisply rendered. There is also nice attention to detail throughout-little things like the carrots on Bonnie Hopps' skirt, Judy's activity tracker watch, and Mrs. Otterton's thread-pilling sweater. Characters' fur looks to stand out and flow naturally. It is clear directors Byron Howard, Rich Moore, Jared Bush and their animation team set out to make a visually satisfying movie experience that doesn't skimp on animation quality. Disney should be proud of their latest effort. Zootopia works well not just as a animated movie or family film-but just as a good movie period. I certainly wouldn't oppose going to see it again. It works on multiple levels and should be appealing to the whole family. 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Liberal Brainwashing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is an attempt to make children become democrat, and it isn't subtle. It sends a message that we should hold people blameless for their bad behavior e.g. the sly fox in the movie:), and instead blame stereotypes for that person's bad behavior.The writers of the movie tried to act as if the move were aware of behavior that supports stereotypes, per the na?ve bunny cop (political symbol for women getting in the military/police via gender discrimination programs, as attested by the assistant mayor lamb) who defends the publicly discriminated-against fox (symbol for black people) who ironically ends up behaving exactly in line with the stereotype (swindling the store to make money dishonestly).So the na?ve bunny gets a taste of reality with the fox acting sly even though she wanted to believe that he was good and that everyone else who was discriminating against the fox was evil and wrong and stupid. So at that point, the movie appears to be informed and aware of how groups of people truly behave, and shows how stereotypes exist because of supporting behavior/statistics.However, later the movie exonerates this fox's behavior by telling a story. Once when the fox was a child, he was discriminated against by non-predator mammals. The child fox then, and only then, decided that he might as well act like the stereotype because that's how people would treat him regardless. And voila, the movie exonerates the fox, holding him blameless for his wayward life. It shifts the guilt on everyone else, except the badly behaved. This movie poisons children's' minds to think that stereotypes are what cause bad behavior. It warps the child's perspective into thinking that people would act perfectly as long as we assume they will. It has the aim to render our children mindless about actual statistics and behavior when in comes to groups of people. For example, if you have a few bad burritos in a row at Chipotle then its okay if you don't like the place and don't want to go back. But this movie tries to dumb down the mind and say that you're not allowed to use that same basic logic when you are treated rudely a few times in a row in your first experiences with black female cashiers at Walmart. This movie mistakenly says that your mind must shut down when it comes behavioral patterns in people / races / ethnicities / demographic groups / financial classes.Of course, there are no universal stereotypes. There are always exceptions and sometimes they are material exceptions. But people ARE accountable for their own actions and people's behavior/attitudes CAN be generalized because their own behavior supports it in large numbers. Anyone who tries to tell you otherwise is the real racist. They are the ones that will ignore reality in the name of race. They will ignore behavior in the name of race. Well, that's the definition of racism - making judgments based upon race only, and ignoring behavior.Besides the sloths, which are hilarious by the way, this movie is worse than nothing. Please protect your children from this movie. Their entire voting future, friend associations, schools of choice, marriage partners, and jobs may depend on it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Heartfelt film with a strong positive message for both children and adults</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Disney has been on a winning streak lately, releasing great animated movies like Wreck-it Ralph, Frozen and Big Hero 6. The studio manages to add another gem to its line-up with Zootopia: a great film that tells a heartfelt story, while intelligently covering some delicate themes.The film follows the endeavors of Judy Hopps, a rabbit who wants to be a police officer in a world inhabited by anthropomorphic animals. The twist is that all animals are sized like they are in the real world. Being a small rabbit, Judy is often confronted with difficulties while trying to fulfill her dream, but she never gives up. After graduating at the top of her class, she ends up in the metropolis of Zootopia, where she is tasked with parking duty. Of course, Judy is not satisfied with this trivial activity. Thanks to her determination she manages to get assigned to a disappearance case. Since she does not get any help from the police force, she ends up trying to crack the case with a wayward fox named Nick.The story unfolds itself to be a heartfelt journey through some visually stunning environments. Zootopia is divided into several districts, including a desert, a rain forest and a snowy suburb. This ensures the movie never looks boring, as Judy and Nick travel through different parts of the city to solve their case. A lot of time was put into developing the city and all its details. The rain forest district, for example, stays humid thanks to an abundance of sprayers, ensuring the inhabitants feel right at home.While going through their journey, both Judy and Nick learn a lot about themselves and the world around them. Their characters are very well developed and undergo a logical and heartfelt evolution. This is where the movie really shines in my opinion, as it touches on some very delicate issues such as race and discrimination. It avoids being too preachy, but at the same time raises some really interesting questions, both for children and adults alike. These questions are all the more interesting when considering the recent racial tensions in the US and the refugee crisis in Europe. I had some very interesting conversations after the movie ended.Of course, there is also room for humor. There are a lot of puns and predictable funny moments alluding to animal stereotypes. The jokes are very well worked out though and they never feel cheesy.Overall, this is probably my favorite animated Disney movie since the Disney Revival started more then five years ago. It has great, lovable characters, a beautiful set-up, some great laughs and most importantly: a strong positive message for both kids an adults.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I will try my best not to make a speech here. When I first heard of this film, I was excited. Excited by the plot, and also the fact the same people made Wreck-it Ralph and Big Hero 6. I managed to watch a preview screening in the cinema I work in. I was certainly not let down!This film introduces us to another beautifully created world by Disney, with new and amazing places, cultures and characters. There were clear signs throughout the film that the creators put in a lot of effort to make this an enjoyable film for everyone, through appearance and story. I won't mention any spoilers, but I will say the way they introduce us to different characters, different places and everything in general was superbly down.In all, I would definitely say this is in my top 10 animated films I've ever seen. I would strongly recommend this to anyone, from young children, to adults who are children at heart (like me). 9/10 .Go watch it, I'll certainly be watching it again!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Marginally better than Inside Out, Much better than Frozen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(Don't get me wrong, I love Frozen, but I feel it's been overplayed in pop culture that it's more boring than it should be. Maybe a few years of space will revive it)Zootopia is a fantastic film, quite analogous to the current political climate in the western world, but still a fun film even when the themes are ignored.We follow Judy Hopps, a rabbit who has a dream of becoming a Police Officer. However, in the world of Zootopia, the Police Force is dominated by larger animals, making Judy the first Rabbit on the force.Right out the gate, the film makes it obvious the story is about prejudice, but it has a few twists along the way.You see, there are two polarities in Zootopia. There's Predator/Prey relations, and Size relations. The world attempts to accommodate for the needs of all the inhabitants, but the world is still ruled by stereotypes. Judy Hopps has to fight hard for her position, having to be the Valedictorian of her class at the Police Academy, but she is still relegated to being a Parking Officer because of her size. She is forced to prove herself to be the best, even though a fair society will have given her the benefit of the doubt.The other polarity is Predator/Prey relations, a direct parallel to Majority/Minority races in the Western World. The Predators are a minority in the world of Zootopia, making about 10% of the population. Because of their evolutionary ancestors, there is a prejudice against them that they could turn feral at any moment, becoming ruthless killers like they were before they became anthropomorphic animal-people. The plot in Act 2 and 3 becomes a political conspiracy to frame the predators for a series of attacks against the prey to throw society against them. This can be seen in real life, especially regarding how the west sees Muslim people and/or black people.The one flaw, however, is that they pull a very similar plot twist to Frozen, in that a background character is revealed to be the 'True' Villain, just like Hans. Just like Frozen, the villain reveal comes literally minutes before the end of the film, making their impact to the story rushed.Overall, this is a great movie, and a very timely one at that. Perhaps some of the pop-culture references will become dated, but like all Disney movies, there will be enough here to make the film a timeless classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lively and Innocent !!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In Zootopia, a re-envisioned animal world that is run on civilized mechanics, a rabbit Judy Hopps (Ginnifer Goodwin) defends her classmates from a bully, decides to go for a course-correction as far as ambition goes and signs up for the police academy. Her world is much like the human one - differences of class, sex and stature are there but that does not stop them from having equal opportunity. A moose can comfortably and confidently co-anchor the evening news with a snow leopard without having to worry about being preyed upon. The food chain hierarchy is maintained but it doesn't stop age-old nature driven adversaries from coming together for the common good. Zootopia's inhabitants don't distinguish between predator and prey, and everyone of them look and talk humanistic even though they retain their original ways in terms of elementary design and movements. The character design in fact, hearkens back to the 1973 Disney film 'Robin Hood'. It's quite a progressive world out there even though there's a hierarchy that is determined mostly by abilities. Considering that this creation comes from the American region it's to be accepted that motor-mouths and 'isms prevail. Like in the real world, size and ability matters most. The big ones like the rhinos, tigers and buffalo a.k.a Capt. Bogo (Idris Elba) get to be responsible for maintaining law and order. Judy is the smaller who rises way beyond her stature to achieve distinction. This film tackles real world issues in an animal friendly manner. Racism, gender bias and other ills are trolled with a feminist zeal here. There's a dark side that references LA Confidential and Godfather with a great deal of punch and pizazz. Crowned by loads of attitude, eye-pleasing animation, trendy music and sharply suave voicing, this Zootopia is sure to draw the audience in like bees to a honey pot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's an okay movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Where everyone is a critic and giving a 10/10 score is more mouth-watering than rabbit stew, I am only doing this review because of the plethora of "Excellent!" and "Incredible!", as well as "zomg, best movie ever! 5/7, luv luv, cute bunny, funny!" and so on and so forth.This movie is average at best. It had it's great moments and the immense attention to detail truly deserve recognition, but that alone is not worth a perfect score.Now I'm not blind to what this movie was trying to portray. I saw how it displayed the hatred toward predators to the modern hatred towards Muslims. But an unrealistic message, being portrayed by the most unrealistic way possible; 'cannibals and herbivores living in harmony'(meat eaters needs to eat meat. Don't you dare bring up tofu), does not deserve the amount of universal praise that it is currently getting. I believe this is why the public is so wet (I say wet because I have read some tweets about how some viewers wanted to screw the bunny, and not in the "normal eating" kind of way) over this movie, because it tried to spread a message of peace and love. But when politics and movies combine, seldom do they work.It has it's funny and pensive parts; but I don't see it having any memorable parts. This movie is just okay. I'll probably watch it in the future when I have forgotten about it. I'm surprised this movie is rated more than the documentary/film of the Catholic's church biggest scandal.That's okay though; keep living in your happy, cuddly, and predator-free bubble.I'll rate this movie a 7/10 as that is what I feel the movie deserves.</fullReview>

Apparently, the Evil White Sheep are jealous of the Predators' generally Bigger Size, and their many positions of social prominence. Consequently, the Devious White Sheep come up with a plot to poison the Predators with covert Steroid-like injections, causing symptoms similar to 'Roid Rage. Targeted Predators have the savage components of their DNA activated and unleashed by the injections, causing them to suddenly behave out of character. Whether it's starting to nibble on an opponent in the boxing ring, beating or cheating or beheading the Predator's White Sheep spouse, or sexually assaulting a Predator Miss Zootopia, the secret injections begin to give Predators a Bad Name.

		<shortDescription>lousy script, horrible soundtrack and all too cliché</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I decided to watch this Disney's movie for it seems to have an original scenario with a mesmerizing visual. It is a beautiful movie to watch and quite entertaining for the first 30 minutes. But then it ceased to be watchable with all the old clichés recycled by Disney, not to mention the horrible soundtrack.It is no doubt an allegory of the modern world, the all too American city with an all too American dream, struggling to deal with its own diversity. Only, in this scenario, the diversity is oversimplified for the benefit of young minds: there are predators and there are preys. Predators traditionally eat preys, we get that. Somehow the civilized world infused with an American dream "Yes, we can." has tamed all the individuals within the predatory species. There's still crime, though, that's why Bunny needs to become a police officer.An ode to tolerance and respect of diversity gone terribly wrong: we learn that being bad has nothing to do with your DNA, nor the fact of being good has anything to do with your upbringing or experience. Then we have to agree that to make the world a better place we need to accept that status quo while trying as hard as one could to succeed within that frame. Fighting for the weak 99%, we have to accept that the 1% is not inherently bad. Oh wait, who is this 1% ? They're the powerful (lion mayor), but also the prejudiced (foxes). They're the privileged, but also the criminals. On the other hand, preys are all underprivileged and struggling to gain some power; they are nevertheless the ones to whom the message is directed: prejudices come from them too and THAT could make everyone worse off.Predators do not have to work for a better world, all they have to do is to accept that preys could do things, too, only preys have to succeed far better than any predator ever could given the same circumstances or the same DNA...It makes me want to reply to that: We need to acknowledge the elephant in the room.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of my fave words in the English language is anthropomorphic. I've always liked how it could win you a scrabble tournament with it's bonus word score. The latest Walt Disney offering "Zootopia" features a wonderful cast of anthropomorphic animals...though I should warn you some of them will appear nude in one scene. Among them is a rabbit who dreams of becoming a police officer and a cynical con man sly Fox voiced by Jason Bateman (the poor mans Michael J Fox) and together they must solve a conspiracy. The fun lies in working out who's behind this heinous plot and along the way explore this amazing place called Zootopia with it's various tundras that are bought to life with some stunning animation. I laughed like a Hyena (one animal not living in this city) since there's plenty going on here for adults to like on one level and children on a whole other plain. TV's Luther, Idris Elba, adds voice to the Rhino boss cop as Chief Bogo. This flick is a great commentary on how we are all on this big Melting Pot called Earth and need to live together without resorting to our primal base DNA instincts. It's very topical in light of not only the US Elections, but also recent terrorist events in Belgium. Chances are if you loved the big screen spectacle of Frozen and Big Hero 6 you'll fall heavily for this very entertaining movie. The perfect Easter Holidays movie...it's even got Bunnies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Solid and clever, but falls victim to basic clichés and contrivances</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Zootopia is extremely creative and a bit edgier than many Disney movies. Similarly to Inside Out, Zootopia is an animated film that can be enjoyed by children on the surface, and enjoyed by adults who get little references and see the deeper meaning the film is trying to put across. The problem comes in the way this clever story is told.The two main characters, while easy enough to care about, form the very standard "unlikely friendship" that we've seen in lots of other movies. It was very tiring to see the same scenes I've seen everywhere else, just with a bunny and a fox instead of humans. Also, the stakes of the film didn't feel as real as many other films. There were several moments where the movie puts the characters in a potentially dangerous situation, but instead of having them try to find their way out of it, the film pulls the rug out from under you and shows that the characters were on top of things the whole time. While this can be funny, and it does work at the beginning, there were points where it seemed like the film had no real stakes at all. Which is disappointing.That being said, the film was funny and clever, and the animation and voice acting were top-notch. However, the plot was often reduced to basic things we've seen before. Definitely a good kid's film, and a film adults will get decent enjoyment out of.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the best animation I've seen in a long time. This will probably go down as one of Disney's best. It was funny, it was witty, it was cleverly written and it had a very good message."Zootopia" is not the first anthropomorphic Disney movie. Just about every Disney movie gives human qualities and characteristics to animals, cars, planes, etc. This movie was unique in that it united the entire mammal world in one (seemingly) harmonious location. But what looked like harmony from a distance had some underlying ugly but accepted societal norms.Beneath the beautiful exterior was stereotyping and making sweeping statements to encompass entire species. Those remarks could easily have been applied to the same situations we face as human beings trying to live with one another.If the conflict of the movie could be summarized it would've been with one scene. There was one particular discourse between Judy Hopps (Ginnifer Goodwin), a rabbit, and her parents. She'd gotten attacked by a fox and her parents' statement was something to the effect that all foxes were jerks. Her response was that he was a jerk that happened to be a fox.The movie was replete with the message of inclusion and forgoing stereotypes and bigotry. It was a very positive movie that was cleverly written and offered plenty of laughs.</fullReview>

First off, going into this movie I thought it was going to be a good Disney, not excepting anything special but I was completely wrong. Zootopia is one of Disney best movies yet, it has lots of depth, didn't rely on poop jokes it had a story and it focused on the story. The animation was beautiful to look at. The voice acting was fantastic by everyone. Jason Bateman was fantastic for the role perfect. The thing that I was most surprised by in this movie is the depth. There are a lot of hidden messages about our world today, what's going on and that's what makes this movie a great movie for both kids and parents.

		<shortDescription>The Fox and the Hare</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Once upon a time, predatory animals were either the sinister villains or the square-jawed heroes of Disney Animated films, with the cuddly animals ("prey" if I'd go further) being either comic relief or the central protagonist. With "Zootopia", where anthropomorphic mammals live and breathe in a bustling metropolis ala humans (with nary a homo sapien in sight), the tables have turned - cuddly animals such as our heroine, a rabbit cop named Judy Hopps (Ginnifer Goodwin) has shifted into figures of empowerment and inspiration, while big predatory animals have become either the cute ones - as seen in an overweight man-child cheetah cop who obsesses over a famous pop star while on desk duty - or a mischievous comic relief as per con-artist fox Nick Wilde (Jason Bateman).Wilde is the archetypal wily fox ? there's not a word that he says that isn't cynical or sarcastic. Although the character is animated, this is essentially Bateman being his laid-back self, which strongly anchors this film down to earth. Wilde provides a pleasant foil against Goodwin's Hopps, who is eager to do good (not unlike co- director Rich Moore's "Wreck-It Ralph") and make Zootopia a better place, but constantly finds her naiveté not only challenged by Wilde's put- downs, but also by her own parents' over-protectiveness and even the Zootopia police chief, a bison (voiced by Idris Elba) and caricature of the stereotypical cop-movie chief, who bluntly tells Hopps that being a cop "isn't some fairy tale with songs and dance. Let it go."Indeed, "Zootopia" is not the usual Disney fare ? the similarity ends with the talking animals, extremely likable characters and rapid- fire humor ? I lost it in numerous scenes, particularly an adorable riff on "The Godfather" ? that will entertain kids and adults alike. What we have here is essentially a buddy cop movie (think "48 Hrs", "Rush Hour", "Lethal Weapon") that skirts into noir territory at times - where one's a do-gooder cop and the other's a rebel, and they both team up to stop a bigger threat towards the city, bonding in the process. The Disney version, at least. Spoilers ahead.How this leads into a political conspiracy involving a plot to segregate the prey from predators, I will not reveal. Here Disney makes a bold move, not only subverting their decades-old predator/prey animal tropes, but not-so-subtly confronting the media blitz against race-induced crimes. I am instantly reminded of the American media who gobble up any news involving multi-racial crimes and subsequent controversies with law enforcement, with no qualms given to either side of the fence to express their proper opinion. Howard and Moore, along with their writers, remarkably handle their material sensibly and level-headedness ? and with Disney's lesson of the movie ? about acceptance and unity, delivered with care.This could be one of the year's best films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great feel good movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pixar can't seem to do anything wrong, can they? First with Inside Out last year, and back at it again with Zootopia. This movie is a feel good movie that touches the heart, and that preaches that being different is okay. The premise is that a city where animals(both predator and prey) can live in harmony safe from the actual food chain, until something goes horribly wrong which seemingly reverts back to pre-civilized days. Idris Elba leads a cast that entertains you throughout the movie, and makes it so you can't not like this movie. It is beautifully made, and an eye-catcher at that. The cute subtleness of how all animals are different is on a whole new level, especially after the whole "Chris Rock can make a black joke" a the Academy Awards just a week ago. RATING: I would give this movie a high 7/low 8. Primarily because it didn't have as much meaning I feel, as say Finding Nemo, Wall-E, or Toy Story. However, with that being said, this movie is a no-doubt must see. Who can say no to Pixar? REVIEW: To summarize this movie in one word it'd have to be "touching" where it makes you laugh, smile, cry, and basically feel everything Inside Out wanted you to... AGE: Approved for all ages, and all audiences.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's an amazing animated film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I did not think Disney had it in them to create something as sophisticated as Zootopia. It's slightly off the Disney formula than you would expect as it talks to the entire audience, not just children about the lessons of tolerance.Zootopia is about a bunny who is told she can not be a cop because she's a bunny, who teams up with a Fox, who this bunny has been told since birth that his kind cannot be trusted, in order to solve the case of some missing animals.It's been a while since I've seen Disney do this style of Anthropomorphism (not since the Disney Afternoon, with such shows as Tale Spin, which this movie reminds me of) , but it is a great way to tell a very mature story about not judging a book by it's cover and feeding it to everyone.

		<fullReview>"Life's little bit messy. We all make mistakes. No matter what type of animal you are, change starts with you." Judy Hopps (voice of Ginnifer Goodwin)In the land of Zootopia, where all anthropomorphic animals are ostensibly equal, little bunny Judy aspires to be a cop. And she makes it. And she learns her idealism of making a difference is a messy business, like life itself. While this 'toon is clever by any measure, it goes for the heart of living by emphasizing the humanity of endeavors rather than visual techniques (although there's plenty of that).Although our political language is laced with the need for diversity, Zootopia actually shows young people in an allegorical adventure that all species, all races, all kinds of people can prosper together given the right motivation. It is still messy, but it is possible that animals (people), predators and prey, can exist in harmony with a little motivation.The conflict that anchors this exciting actioner is that some previously docile predators have become savage. Officer Hopps, with the help of a sly fox, Nick Wilde (Jason Bateman), traces the source of the change to a plant that could only be likened to heroin (not Cannabis, which has been lionized so to speak recently). The thrill of the chase is trumped by the witty dialogue, almost screwball comedy quick (e.g., the answer to "What do you call a three humped camel?" while not quick and brilliant, is an amusing example of the pervasively comic tone).The slowest sequence may be the funniest: The two "detectives" end up at the Zootopia DMV, run by all sloths. About his friend, Nick says, "Are you saying that because he's a sloth, he can't be fast?" Well, nobody's fast at this bureau, including the jokes, which depend on the sloths' glacial reactions. If you've ever waited at the DMV, you will savor this satire.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Smart, funny and beautifully animated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Disney's latest animated feature is smart, funny and beautifully animated. It might look like your standard talking animal fare, but it has a lot going on, with some smart metaphors and a complex story. Zootopia is an enormous city full of anthropomorphic mammals who have evolved to live together in a cooperative society that consists of both predators and prey of every sort - they have long since given up on being enemies. Ginnifer Goodwin plays Judy Hopps, the first rabbit to make it onto the Zootopia police force - though all mammals have supposed equality, prejudices kind of rule their society, and such a small creature has never been able to be in such a position before. Judy is initially given simple duties, but she insists on being more and eventually finds her way into a major investigation of disappearing citizens. She teams up with a con artist fox (Jason Bateman), and the two search for clues. The film introduces a lot to think about; it definitely could get young ones considering things like prejudice, stereotypes and racism, and without ever seeming obvious or preachy. The characters are great and the animation wonderful. I did think the story resolves itself way too easily, like, at a certain point, the filmmakers either hit a wall and decided they had to take a shortcut to the end, or perhaps they were thinking a young audience would be getting bored so they just hand the protagonists the answer to hurry things along. The film still may be above younger audience members' heads - the smallest kids in my theater seemed to grow tired of it quickly. All in all, it's a good time and a fine addition to the Disney canon.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Zootopia" is an excellent family movie with a message.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Prejudice is very difficult to root out. (Yeah, this is a review about an animated Disney movie, but why can't a family film also have a more mature message?) Unlike discrimination, which refers to overt acts that society can deal with (mostly) through properly-enforced laws and well-designed public policy, prejudice is an attitude and cannot be legislated away. The word prejudice developed from the medieval legal term "prejudgment" and today refers to a wide variety of prejudgments that people make every day, based on someone else's association with a certain group. These are prejudices people often hold for their entire lives ? sometimes without even realizing it. Does being a Muslim mean supporting terrorism or being atheist mean lacking morals? Is being short a sign of weakness or being fat an indication of gluttony? Are most black people criminals or most whites racist? Most (if not all) of us would answer "no" to all these questions if asked by another person, and would probably feel we were answering honestly. But? do our actions or choice of words at other times betray some deep-seated prejudices we may not be aware that we have? Along with being an excellent movie which most people will find entertaining regardless of their age, the animated feature "Zootopia" (PG, 1:48) subtly asks these questions to the more mature members of the audience, while carrying important messages to all.Zootopia is a big city in a land where humans don't exist and anthropomorphic animals have formed their own orderly society. Having evolved beyond their primal roles of predator and prey, they all live together in relative peace and harmony, except when jealousy, greed or prejudices raise their ugly heads. (Hey, animals are people too.) One of those walking talking animals is Judy Hopps (voiced by Ginnifer Goodwin), a young female bunny who fulfills her much-derided childhood dream of becoming the first rabbit to join the Zootopia Police Department. As Judy leaves behind her parents (Bonnie Hunt and Don Lake), and her 275 siblings, to take the train from rural Bunnyburrow into the colorful big city with its tall buildings and varied habitat neighborhoods, you can easily imagine Taylor Swift's "Mean" playing in the background. But the meanness doesn't stop when Judy starts her new hard-won job.When Judy takes her place among the wolves, lions, tigers, rhinos and elephants that she now calls colleagues, they all overlook her (literally and figuratively). Chief Bogo (Idris Elba), a cape buffalo, assigns her parking meter duty, at which she immediately excels, but she wants more out of her job than being a meter maid. She becomes aware of the mysterious disappearance of over a dozen animals from different predatory species around the city and she promises one worried wife (Octavia Spencer) that she will help. Judy develops a lead which takes her to a con-man fox named Nick Wilde (Jason Bateman) whom she promptly cons into helping her pursue that lead. The trail of evidence they follow takes them to a naturist club run by a free-spirited Yak (Tommy Chong), to a DMV office run by sloths (a clever joke supported by the voices of Raymond S. Persi and Kristen Bell), to the feared crime boss Mr. Big (Maurice LeMarche), to City Hall to get the help of Assistant Mayor Dawn Bellwhether (Jenny Slate) and to a secret medical facility controlled by Mayor Lionheart (JK Simmons). As Judy and Nick figure out what's really going on, they learn some surprising and important things about each other ? and themselves."Zootopia" really does have something for everyone. The littlest audience members will enjoy the colorful scenery, the variety of animals and the action sequences, and are likely to identify with the undersized main character with oversized dreams. Teens and adults will appreciate the sly references to "Breaking Bad" and "The Godfather", the presence of Shakira as a singing gazelle known as "Gazelle" and the important lessons about fighting to be taken seriously and the damaging effects of prejudice. As well-written, well-animated and well-voiced as this film is, its main strength and importance lie in its messages. Prejudice is shown as self-perpetuating and, when allowed to exist unchallenged, actually able to reverse society's progress in the areas of equality and tolerance. Unfortunately, those lessons, as important as they are, sometimes come off a bit oversimplified ? and so central to the story, that it's not quite as much fun as I'd expect an animated film to be. Still, "Zootopia" is an excellent family film. "A-"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spoiler Free: A lot of fun and a great animated film (even with some minor problems here and there)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first heard about Zootopia (back when it was a 2D film) I was both excited and nervous. The anthropomorphic animal idea has been done before, but never has it been used incredibly well. Robin Hood has animals, but the animals don't live in a world that is as interesting as they are.However, Zootopia happily makes a creative world that is interesting look at and explore (and fortunately, it does explore its world extensively).The greatest element of this movie is the animals and how they are personified. The Water Buffalo is big, massive, tough, and doesn't care about people's issues. The fox (Nick) is sly, clever, and always trying to escape. The rabbit (Judy), is fast, agile, and always ready to act. This makes for some very lively characters and very fun to watch characters. The animation in this movie is gorgeous and the use of depth perception is really good. Almost every shot is beautiful. You can tell a lot of work went into the look of this movie.The story itself is good and uses clever elements (and some social commentary) about how a population full of predators and prey would work. What issues would there be? What could go wrong? A lot of these ideas are explored in this film and it sometimes can feel a little heavy-handed, but for the most part all of the subtext works within the film (though there are a couple of moments where it is blatantly aimed at the audience).My main issue with the film is the final act and the villain. The concept is neat, but the amount of time spent between the villain revealing their-self and them being defeated is about 3 minutes. I know it is supposed to be a mystery until the end, but it didn't seem like a very big pay-off for all of the build-up.Some of the side-issues involve the drama between some of the characters that feels a little forced just for the sake of drama. Should there be some drama? Yeah, but it should be done in a more logical manner.All in all, Zootopia is a very entertaining film from Disney and I'm glad I saw it. The animation is great, the story is pretty solid, and the characters support the movie and make it worth a watch even if you don't like the story or some of the (mildly) preachy moments.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pixar does it again! "Zootopia" rocks!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So I was in theaters and had the choice of watching this or "Gods of Egypt". It really wasn't a hard decision, mainly because I was getting tired of the overly CGI with live action spectacle. And because I thoroughly enjoy most Walt Disney Animation Studios movies since 2007. In this case, this film really beat my expectations. I really didn't know much about this movie besides the facts that it revolves around talking animals. Kind of like "Madagascar", except this film is much better than "Madagacar" or "Ice Age" in my own opinion. This really does touch base with today's ideology and philosophy with the right tone. When it comes to the setting it takes place in a environment where all the animals try to live in harmony while living there lives like regular day to day human beings. Except they still have certain animal attributes and characteristics because they are still animals. And the main plot revolves around a bunny rabbit named Judy Hopps who always dreamed of becoming a cop and playing a part in making the world a better place. So she enters the police force and later teams up with a fox named Nick Wild. Who is actually a bit of a con artist and a hustler. The thing is Hopps is put down on the force for being a rabbit and people don't really trust Nick Wild because he is a fox. So that label just sticks with them and brings them down throughout the movie. I however really liked the chemistry of these two characters, it was cute and I enjoyed the banter between the two. Because of the clever quirky and snappy dialogue. It's like hearing the dialogue for "500 Days of Summer" except it's aimed for the whole family. So yeah, the interaction and chemistry between the two leads is actually better than some adult films out there because it's so well written. I really didn't expect this movie to be a buddy cop movie, which either is a hit or a miss and I will say this is a big hit. Anyways they are both put in a situation where they try to solve a kidnapping case that goes deeper and deeper as the story progresses. Like I said the chemistry between the main two leads is fantastic. One is a super idealist and the other is a skeptic, one has the heart and a good mindset while the other has the street smart but they are both clever in there own way. This film really resonated with me and the endearing moments actually got to me. I just didn't expect this film to be all that deep until I saw it. In fact I think this film will resonate more with adults than kids. Mainly because of certain jokes, references such as modern culture and mindset, certain messages and etc. Which will just blow right past most kid audiences. And I really liked the messages in this movie, it's something I put a lot of thought of in the past and something I could resonate with. It's something that I think everyone should apply in there lives instead of acting like a heard of sheeps. But whatever floats each others boat. However I do think this film will boost furry fandom to another level. I really can't see any flaws with this film except maybe the pacing is slightly slow at times, but I don't even think that should even be a gripe. It's just me probably being picky. The build up is good and I actually cared about the characters and the situations. Overall I thoroughly enjoyed this film and I would highly recommend it. Some may say this movie is a bit too idealistic. But I just recently finished the 5th season of "Game of Thrones" which basically deals with constant skepticism, assumptions, hubris ramblings and betrayal. That there is a motive for EVERYTHING! So this film was refreshing to me, mainly because it balances out the idealistic thoughts and rationality. That sometimes following your heart might not be enough to lead to the right destination. And that a balance of both is needed sometimes, which I agree with.10/10</fullReview>

Above the movie is in the details, every frame has a phenomenal depth to it. Only area of improvement would be background music. The Hopps, specially dad-Stu Hopps animation &amp; voice match is magical, the character is so real. Movie has perfect balance of handling racism and holds a mirror for us to reflect. The method of handling the suspense of a detective story is well done. Several scenes clearly show the brilliance in the movie, for example the DMV scene is funny and real !!

		<shortDescription>One of Disney's best in many years</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After the nadir of quality Disney experienced during the early 2000s, with subpar films like Home on the Range and Chicken Little, the beloved animation studio has experienced a new coming. From Tangled to Frozen, the company has put itself back on the map as a maker of quality animated films. With the exception of Big Hero 6 and Wreck it Ralph, most of these have been tributes to the classic fairy tale musicals. And now, Disney brings the animal stories back too with possibly their best animated movie since Mulan.While the idea of a city populated by funny animals isn't anything new, Disney still manages to bring new energy to the concept. This is possibly the first time they've ever handled social commentary in a family-oriented animated movie excluding Pixar. While the film is very comedic and amiable in nature, it still handles stuff like crime, discrimination and even corruption in a smart way that both adults and children can understand. It never comes across as too wordy for the young ones or too dumbed down for the old ones, the balance is well kept during its simple but potent story. The lesson the film teaches its audience is a very mature and relevant one especially during these times.The characters of this film are definitely one of its biggest strengths; this is possibly the most lovable and colorful cast of animal characters they've had since Robin Hood and The Lion King. Judy Hopps is a very likable lead that's easy to root for, Nick Wilde is a brilliant companion for her that has a surprising amount of depth to him to boot, and the supporting cast is nothing short of memorable. From the hilarious DMV sloth Flash to the curmudgeonly police officer Bogo, the characters leave an impression, even though some of them don't have that much screen time. And even without them, the chemistry between Nick and Judy would be strong enough to hold the movie.The animation itself on the characters is excellent, from expressions and movements to the multitude of detail on their fur, clothes and limbs. Even though they're CGI, they still have a very classic Disney feel to them too. Zootopia itself looks fantastic on the big screen, as it's like a mix of natural environments and an almost Vegas-like city. This is one of the most creative worlds Disney has done in recent years, and it really pays off.The film does have its flaws, however. As funny as the comedy is, there are a couple of times when the jokes are a little too obvious (how many elephant in the room- gags do we need?). As catchy as the song "Try Everything" is, Shakira's character in the film feels a little tacked-on, as she has way less screen time than most of the main characters, despite how much her involvement in this film got limelight during this film's promotion. The villain of the film is also rather uninteresting as a character, despite the surprising twist regarding the reveal of said character. Disney has done the surprise twist villain thing way too much recently that it's getting rather tiring; can't we get a charismatic, show-stopping villain like Jafar from Aladdin at least for once? Still, for a film this strong, those feel like minor nitpicks and don't ruin the experience.Overall, Zootopia is a strong new entry in the Disney Feature Animation canon. With its humor, imagination and heart, it's a good candidate for the winner of Best Animated Feature in the next Academy Awards.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>'Zootopia' Review: A Near-Perfect Disney Movie, Brilliantly Tackles Diversity and Discrimination</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Disney has done an incredible job with storytelling over the years. They give us films fused with real-world problems and explain it so well that children can truly understand what's going on in the world today. Adults and parents are also reminded of the problems we have through their storytelling. "Zootopia" is another film in which they accomplish just that."Zootopia" is a place where all animals, predators and prey alike, get along. It's a city where any animal can chase their wildest dreams, while coexisting with all other species. We follow Judy Hopps (Ginnifer Goodwin), a rabbit who was told she could never become a cop. She completes the police academy and moves to Zootopia to follow her dreams. Judy is first assigned to parking ticket duty. Frustrated, she then takes the seemingly impossible task of finding a kidnapped Otter. She sees that she needs help, and finds the clever fox Nick Wilde (Jason Bateman) to accompany her on her quest. On her journey she finds very revealing details about some of the animals and the case gets very interesting."Zootopia" is absolutely hilarious and still carries all the heart- warming and tear-jerking moments Disney is so wonderful at creating. The voice-over work is flawless and is filled with an incredible supporting cast.Most importantly, the creators show us discrimination in a different way on the big screen so everyone can witness what's happening everyday all around us. They show us the problems with diversity and immigration in a way everyone can understand, even children, which are the future and we can't allow these problems to continue.The city reminds me of New York City, and we must remember the poem on the Statue of Liberty. "Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free, the wretched refuse of your teeming shore." This should still be deemed true today.Check out our content at ishmovies.wordpress.com!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Buddy Cop Film With A Lot of Heart</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The buddy cop genre. It's seen a lot of unique takes over the years, but this is certainly one of the most memorable. Our main characters are a police bunny named Judy Hopps (played by Jenifer Goodwin) and a con artist fox named Nick Wilde (played by Jason Bateman). Judy has a tough and no-nonsense attitude while Nick is more careless and manipulative, so these two characters play off each other perfectly. The rest of the casting is perfect. I can't think of a single role that was miscast (I especially love Idris Elba as the police commissioner). The story goes that Judy used to live in a rural town, where she dreams of moving to the metropolin city of Zootopia to become a police officer. The problem is that no one, not even the commissioner, takes a rabbit seriously as a cop. She is given the duty of meter maid and eventually encounters Nick, who later becomes an important source of information during a mysterious kidnapping plot. Although the film has many humorous moments, it also has some very emotional ones, especially during flashbacks. The stuggles that both these characters have to put up with feels very genuine and realistic, much like the problems that we have today with race, religion, and sexuality. The only thing I thought could have used more work was the writing. It's not bad, and there are some memorable lines, but some jokes fall flat (like the Godfather spoof). Thankfully there are a lot more that work than those that don't. The action scenes are a lot of fun very creative, and the film itself is animated beautifully. Do I recommend this film? The short answer is yes. The long answer is that it depends on what you're looking for. If you want a fun little buddy cop film with a few tear-jerking moments, then you'll love Zootopia.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Disney strikes again with a simply astonishing movie. To start off, I would recommend ANYONE to go watch this movie. This is a movie for anyone of any age.The city of Zootropolis is a busy metropolis with animals instead of humans running the city. Deep beneath its shiny surface, it doesn't turn out to be as glamorous as it leaves the first impression.The story focuses on two characters, Nick and Judy, a fox and a rabbit. The unlikely pair work together to solve the disappearance of 14 citizens of Zootropolis. During their adventures, we learn of Judy's and Nick's background and where they come from to where they are today. The movie is graphically most certainly impressive and the audio is simply a treat to the ears. Especially with Shakira's song cover. It's a simply fantastic movie, filled with humor that would make anyone laugh. And there are heart warming moments too that really make you fall in love with the characters who the story evolves around.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Who says family films only have children to preach to? Well, actually I'm not entirely sure if anyone's ever said that, but it sure sounds like they would though, huh? That debate aside, Disney gets it with its newest installment. Without sounding cliché and trite, Zootopia is literally fun for the whole family. It takes place in a world where animals, both predator and prey, live together in harmony-- except not really. Although things have seemed to change, all the animals still have their reservations and fears about one another. Obviously mirroring a place where our own society is right now, as far as race and religion. The whole movie features various species facing intolerance, while digging into and showcasing possible responses to the prejudices against them--perhaps containing the true depth within this film. The themes are obvious to the adults, but subliminal to the kids. Which is a good thing. It deals with a dark subject matter, and the filmmakers aren't afraid to give us that respective tone either.The main character is Officer Judy Hopps (Ginnifer Goodwin), a bunny rabbit who is finally living her dream of being a police officer in the big city. But she faces adversity since the job is usually held by rhinos or elephants. She's given a case where she has to find an otter who's gone missing--a mystery that adds another fun feature to an already interesting concept. However, it doesn't come until about 35 minutes in--right when you're starting to wonder to yourself what the setup is for.In a refreshing fashion, the writers aren't talking down to their younger audience. It's funny without being over-the-top and irreverent. When the jokes don't work as well, it's never in an embarrassing way. In fact, there may even be more jokes for the adults in this one. However, there are plenty of aesthetic visuals to keep the children entertained for the full runtimeAnimation alone, Zootopia is beautifully detailed. There's so much of it that it's not even possible to see it all in one sitting. And while you're watching it, you wish there were a place just like it where you could visit as soon as the movie finishes.Twizard Rating: 99</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Surprising Joy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Disney has a long history of talking animal movies, and with their latest animated movie, Zootopia, they manage to go beyond the usual trappings of almost every other talking animal movie to make the strongest movie Disney Animation has put out since the Nineties. Now I know that's a bold claim, considering in just the past three to four years alone we've had the likes of Wreck-It Ralph, Frozen, and Big Hero 6, but there is something special about Zootopia that makes it such a strong entry in the Disney canon.The titular Zootopia is an animal metropolis in a world where all animals have evolved to become anthropomorphic beings who dress, act, and live like the humans of our world. Our heroine is Judy Hopps, the first rabbit cop Zootopia has ever seen. Judy is belittled by her superiors and only has 48 hours to prove herself by solving a missing animals case or else she'll have to turn in her badge. With the help of a con artist fox named Nick Wilde, Judy just might be able to do just that. What follows is a story that is as warm and fuzzy as anything that Disney has ever done, but with more shades of our real world sewn thematically throughout the narrative.The whole of Zootopia is about the concept of prejudice against others, or more particularly, our stereotyping people and wanting to put them in a box, saying they cannot go beyond those limitations. We see that everyday in our real world and it's heady stuff for an animated Disney movie, which is why it is great that the movie is as funny as it is. Seriously, this is one of the funniest movies I've seen in a while, animated or live action, which allows the larger ideas at work in the story to never feel preachy. The greatest feat of this movie is how gracefully it skirts around its real meaning without feeling as if the movie makers are pushing their own personal agendas. The movie is made in such a way that moviegoers can graft their own experiences onto these characters because we've all felt the ways that these characters have felt at one point or another -- bullied, underestimated, and misunderstood. In doing this, Zootopia becomes something special, that rare breed of movie that makes you think, feel, and have fun, all in equal measure, with a lot of the fun part coming thanks to the sheer originality at every turn.Zootopia is one of the most original movies Disney has made in a long while, with the city of Zootopia being such a unique creation. All of the different ecosystems in Zootopia are a joy to see, from a rainforest area, to a tundra area, all the way to Little Rodentia, where the mice live in miniaturized skyscrapers, the animators, led by directors Byron Howard and Rich Moore, really capture the essence of both city life and the animal kingdom, in a perfect design meld. Then there are the countless jokes that play off of all the unique traits that each animal species is known for, such as bunnies being good at multiplication or there being only sloths working at the DMV. You can't help but laugh and be amazed at every turn at how nimbly the movie keeps clipping along. Then there's the fact that Zootopia is also a mystery yarn, with the movie often mimicking old detective flicks in the way that Judy and Nick try to solve their case, adding elements of suspense to an otherwise traditional animated movie.So if you can't tell, I loved Zootopia and thought it was a real joy from start to finish. From top to bottom, this is just a well made movie, featuring exceptional writing, directing, voice acting, animation, and music, with Michael Giacchino's musical score infusing lots of tribal African instrumentation to create a score that is different and engaging. While the movie is a little rougher than most parents might expect, due to some frightening moments involving bullies and some rabid animals, kids about seven and up should have a blast with it. I know this big kid did.I give Zootopia a 10 out of 10!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rubbish</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was not particularly hyped up for the movie, but my family members were. So, as soon as it appeared in the cinema, we went to check it out. It was a huge disappointment to me.The sounds, visuals, the animation, the 'acting, are all 10 out of 10.Combine that with an utterly boring, useless, rubbish script.It's not that the movie got plot holes or anything, but it's got no meaning. The whole Zootopia city and universe held so much possibilities that the creators could have built upon... but instead, they went for a really dumb cliché story. So as a movie, it's an utter failure. As a CGI render, it's a nice video.About the story, I am still confused. There are two things at the end. First, you can be anything and can do anything - which is kinda not true - but hey, kids do love false dreams. And the second is, it's perfectly fine to be oppressed, to be ruled by the predators. Which was the weirdest part. I mean, yeah, evil sheep, boo. But she was kinda right.I won't waste any more words, I just hope Disney will step it up next time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is one of the best Disney movies I have ever seen. (I am a huge Disney fan! I've seen every Disney movie ever released.) What I like best about this movie (and most Disney films for that matter) was the true- to-life themes. Zootopia tackled self-doubt, discrimination, tolerance, compassion, fear, and much more. Not to mention, it played out like a real comedy/crime drama with twists and turns throughout. Officer Hopps embodies what many people lack that would make this world a better place--honestly, integrity, empathy, and determination. Nick Wilde shows us that we should not judge a book by its cover. We all have a back-story. This move can be enjoyed and understood by adults and children alike.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In 2013, while following the D23 Expo from home, Zootopia was first announced and it seemed very appealing. I dreaded the long wait to see what Rich Moore and Byron Howard (the director of Wreck-It Ralph with some Simpsons work, and the director of both Bolt and Tangled) would cook up in this film.When the trailers started to come out, I was charmed. When the plot began to unveil, I realized that the relationships between characters and species in this film would apply pretty seamlessly with stereotypes. I was shocked and excited at the possibility that Disney would be making a film that addressed racism as well as stereotypes, and I had some fear that the film would not be so accepted because of this.Fast forward to opening weekend, almost 3 years later. I've been following this film ever since 2013, and I am beyond excited to see it with my friends. The theater isn't completely packed, but still pretty full. We had originally planned to go to a 7 pm showing, but it was sold out, so we ended up going to an 8 pm showing instead. Practically everything I had heard about this movie was good, which fueled my excitement even greater. Then the actual movie came.Wow. Wow wow wow wow wow. I knew that it was already great, but being there, and seeing the unveiled world of Zootopia in full cinematic experience with a lively crowd around you made a very fun adventure, and a world that I am already seeking to return to. I am not sure if I will ever contemplate how much backbreaking work those animators put themselves through to incorporate natural animal movements in these characters as well as putting detail in the surroundings and the city itself. This city, this design alone is worth paying the money in a cinema. It is so immersing and layered with clever tricks and adaptations for all sorts of animals living there. Yeah, and it also looks great with state of the art animation. With a world this big, Disney could have their first real saga.Then there's the cast. Byron and Richard were right in casting Ginnifer Goodwin and Jason Bateman. The two work so well together as Judy Hopps and Nick Wilde. They are well developed, which works in all movies, not just Disney alone. This film also introduced me to Idris Elba's acting, and his performance as Chief Bogo is really good, and he has a secret that had me in stitches. There's so much more about the cast I could say, but this review would go on longer than it already has, and I want anyone who hasn't seen it to find out some points on their own.Also. The Writing and the Humor. Both are solid. This movie has a really good script, and still manages to make us howl (pun intended) with laughter despite its mature themes. And there is one moment in the film of where the look on Nick's face is undeniably one of the best things I have ever seen in my life. Although this is a movie that the whole family can enjoy, it isn't for the faint-hearted kids, and I think that parents should be ready for discussing its themes. If you don't have kids, you might be pondering this movie's messages yourself for days. And my one complaint? There's a certain little character that doesn't even get nearly enough screen time. I won't say who, but I think you'll know when you see it.So altogether, I will say what I said about this on my Facebook. This movie is absolutely fantastic. It has beautiful animation, awesome world building, great comedy and action, a wonderful cast and a sweet yet powerful story that resembles our struggles with discrimination and inclusive societies. Those critics were not kidding, and neither am I.This is why I love Disney. They don't create films for just children. They create films that rock its audiences to the core and connects them while staying wholly original, brilliant and effective without any actual actors or sets. That's the magic of animation. I applaud this company for taking this brave risk making a movie that addresses present issues as powerful as these, and I wholeheartedly encourage anyone who hasn't seen this film to do so ASAP. I know I will be going back.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Versatile Disney Takes On PC Culture</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ever since the turn of the 2010s, Walt Disney Animation Studios has been skyrocketing than ever before with great momentum. From an aspiring restaurateur who became a frog, a princess with long magical hair, a bad guy wanting to be good, a tale of two sisters, and even a troubled boy with his inflatable robot companion. For their latest flick called Zootopia, it's an intriguing caper comedy that not only spoofs the buddy-cop detective formula or noir like in 1988's Who Framed Roger Rabbit, but also tackles the themes that exist in PC (politically correct) culture. In this day and age, political correctness has been ongoing with the media exploiting the misunderstandings and atrocities happening in current events such as injustice and discrimination. Thinking back on the old 1946 Disney film Song of the South featuring characters Br'er Fox and Br'er Rabbit, that's where PC is finally drawn into this movie's characters and "species-ism" is tested.Jason Bateman (Horrible Bosses, Paul) voices con artist, street smart fox Nick Wilde as he makes a living in the animal-inhabited metropolis hustling various individuals. At the same time rural rabbit Judy Hopps (voiced by Once Upon A Time's Ginnifer Goodwin) has just arrived in the big city to begin her first day as the first rabbit officer. Although swift, skilled, and able to hold out on her own, fellow officers don't exactly see her capable of reaching their ranks. It's up to both natural enemies to work together when a crime is committed in the seemingly blissful Zootopia, while at the same time learning that they're not so different from each other.I have to say that in the studio's current Revival Era, the animators have really stepped it up a notch by exploring a PC-coated world completely devoid of all humans and where anthropomorphic animals dominate compared to childhood Disney classics I remembered in the 90s. I'm aware that this "human-less" concept has been done before for many decades during Walt Disney's lifetime and even after his passing, but it looks like nearly everything actually stands out from spoofed product placements to the current trends of music, technology, fashion, and lifestyle. Disney's 1973 movie Robin Hood helped open that door when adding animals in place of the usual human characters, but this time more attention to detail from the largest to the tiniest in the architectural designs looking like a cross between Times Square and Dubai (heck, even a hint of? San Fransokyo). And then there's its inhabitants; they are what makes this entire movie look appealing, inviting, relatable, and immersive. Gazelle's (Shakira) song "Try Everything" was also pretty entrancing to my ears. Disney easter eggs are also pleasing to keep a look out for (try finding some!)To conclude, although the movie does slightly ride off its rails in some scenes involving the lack of exploring further into the other regions that connect to the big city and a concept of an individual who is ostracized based on who they are or what they look like is vaguely similar to 2012's Wreck-It Ralph; it recovers with a thoughtful moral about the big city with real-life social issues and stereotypes being overwhelming and even troubling sometimes. But it's really about finding your true potential and not letting naysayers get the better of you. This isn't just some kids' movie, there's thematic material adults may relate to as well. I can already predict Oscar nods awaiting, too. Go see it and find out for yourself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I loved the film...it's wonderful...but where's the short?!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's quite amazing how far computer graphics have come in films. Watch an older film like "Toy Story" or "Shrek" and you'll see what I mean. They were the cutting edge CGI movies when they came out but when seen today you realize just how far they've come since then. As an experiment, try watching one of these older films and then see the best computer animated film you can find, "Zootopia", and you'll see just how far they've come. The characters not only are gorgeously animated but the film is so rich in texture. Scenes of the characters flying through a rain forest or walking in a bustling metropolis simply look astounding. Combine with that some of the nicest 3D effects you can find and some very lovable characters and you've got a winner.The story is set in a world without humans. However, these animals act and dress much like people. Oddly, however, the predators and prey have somehow worked out their differences and live in peace. However, despite it seeming like a paradise, there still are some prejudices in this world. Animals are often locked within expectations...and the cute bunny, Judy Hopps, finds out the hard way about these expectations. As a child, she wanted to be a police officer...but she finds that the expectation is that they be the huge, hulking animals...the wolves, the rhinos, the elephants and the bears. But Judy is persistent and fights these prejudices in order to become the first rabbit cop...but along the way she learns that hard way that she, too, has prejudices of her own and her new unlikely friend, a fox, helps to show her that she, too, has a way to go when it comes to expectations. Fortunately, while this strong message of political correctness and inclusion is clearly there, it's not obnoxious in its presentation. Additionally, there is a mystery within the story that is clever and diverting...and offers some nice twists as well.So is the film perfect? Not quite. Unlike the typical CGI film, this one did not have a short the preceded it and because of this I felt a bit cheated since this has become the norm for most computer animated films from major studios. Additionally, some might find the message within the film to be a bit heavy-handed...though I didn't mind. Overall, this is a great film for all ages....something that makes it a major plus for families. Parents won't feel like taking a nap and kids will be captivated because the film, if anything, is amazingly cute!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hits the mark only half way.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Visually, it's a treat. Storytelling-wise, it doesn't live up to the hype. The problem with this film is that it's trying to be both a "message" movie and a film noir detective mystery type deal. But the fact that it's so strongly a "message" movie robs the detective element of all its suspense. The two main characters are likable but nobody else really registers. This is what some would call a "SJW" movie about discrimination, racism, tolerance, etc., but the dialogue is dry and the humor is still very basic, it's stereotypical and often animal-based (sloths are slow, cops eat donuts, rabbits breed immensely fast, a joke they milk repeatedly. There are only two vaguely funny scenes, and one was spoiled in an early trailer and wears out its welcome as you're watching it. I really don't see why there's so much love and hype for this. Sure the art and animation are great, but the characters are nothing special, plus the story was predictable and followed the beats of any other police movie. There isn't much that I really enjoyed. The world- building hardly even makes sense. Who decided to build this big city with ridiculously different climates rather than just building multiple cities? What does the metropolis produce for the rest of the world? What do the predators eat if not the herbivores/omnivores? Why do the little critters have their mini-city of Little Rodentia in THE MIDDLE of this vast metropolis? If this is a kids' movie, why are there dark scenes where a mafioso modeled after Don Corleone (very original, guys) threatens characters with torture and death (and the second time around he has the approval of the main characters, who are standing around with grins on their faces)? Also there's that yawn-inducing procedural trope where a character is about to reveal EVERYTHING but succumbs to a fit of violence, only to artificially increase the level of intrigue at play. When the answer to the "night terrors" question presents itself it's out of nowhere and should have been something these smart phone using animals could have looked up in 2 seconds. There's a lot of hare brained storytelling decisions made here. Not to mention much of the movie drags on with a seemingly endless amount of familiar empowerment tropes. The only thing that saves the film from completely collapsing under the weight of its cheerless social justice mission is the way Judy and Nick are written and the banter they share. Honestly... just because this makes some people and movie critics feel better about themselves doesn't change the fact that it's just an OK Disney movie. If it changed your life, good for you. But don't pretend it's some kind of masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was pretty skeptical about this movie before going into the theater, I'd assumed that it was going to be like a slightly better chicken little, so I had my expectations lowered quite a bit before watching this. But dang, this film surprised me, it was amazing! The dialogue, animation, music, humor, everything! Not only that but I can guarantee that adults will enjoy this film instead of just sitting in the theater stuffing popcorn into their mouths. This movie comes with a great message about racism, prejudice, and gender stereotypes. Jason Bateman was spectacular as Nick Wilde along with Ginnifer Goodwin as Judy Hopps, and with Idris Elba as Chief Bogo. If you think your kid will enjoy this movie, then you'll know you will too. TL;DR A hilarious, nicely animated film with a much more intelligent and well thought out plot that strives miles ahead of what most recent films can ever do.

But Zootopia exceeded my expectations with a compelling story, it's good. The story is interesting and smart. It deals with societal issues in a very witty way because it caters to kids as much as adults, which is probably why there is a certain predictability about the characters but it's not at the cost of the story or the message behind it.It's a Disney animation movie so of course there're positive teachable messages in the movie, perseverance, tolerance, open-mindedness, all wrapped in a funny and touching movie with characters that you'll root for and love.Zootopia is a good time at the movies, you'll laugh and be entertain as much as the kids.

Make the world a better place. stick to your dreams in life.I know when a movie is being these days they try to please non Christian and Christian.Looking as a Christian point of viewI wish Disney would of left the Lords name in vain out. They used it in vain two time and maybe a third time. They put one adult scene that could of left out with the naked animal club. because there animals its make OK for kids. but older kids might question the scene more. So this might need to be explained more to kids of mature mind.If your a Christian like me just explain to your kids that a misuse of his name. As long a kid doesn't start misusing his name due to this movie then you will be OK watching this movie because of this misuse of his name and club scene I already know my sister will not let her kids watch this movie at all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The new adventure of Disney not only surprises for its visual beauty also fascinates for its fast connectivity with history, Will be the project of animation of the year? Possibly.Researched topics in the last work of Disney are nothing new, acceptance of a stranger in a new place (remember "Brooklyn"), fight for your dreams, everything is solved, admission and tolerance and others contained in films already has viewed. But despite its clichés bases, the producer always takes advantage of the tools and transforms it in a majestically visual and sentimental way.Disney compensates for its lack of innovative themed with characters and scenarios detailed, beautiful and fatally real. Talking animals? Again, but this time as never seen before. They recreate a metropolis where the human race does not exist, mammals and carnivores coexist in an American atmosphere of the most fresh and thorough (curiously I can't to see a reptile, curious fact) where there are houses, buildings, thieves and police, a fox (Jason Bateman) a angry police (Idris Elba) and any other being of the Kingdom Animalia. "Zootopia" directed by two human Byron Howard ('Tangled') and Rich Moore ('Wreck - It Ralph'), is a film that shows its four years of preparation with its quality and effectiveness of expression, it is true that its two directors already have experience in animated films but this work breaks the limits of an excellent animation, which along with a series of elements manage to win its position in the ranking of the box office."If you can dream it, you can be it""Judy Hopps' (Ginnifer Goodwin) is a beautiful and brave bunny that decides to dream and fight for your precious sleep, then she graduated herself with honors from the Academy of police, she determines to leave the farm of her parents in 'Bunnyburrow' and go to the world's largest city "Zootopia" , there, she's assigned to the chief Bogo (Idris Elba) who entrusted you be a police of transit. She tired of being judged by their noble and harmless appearance traits, she'll solve the mythical question of wild animals with a mischievous and manipulative fox (Jason Bateman), with whom formed a fun relationship and will discover the dark truth.The great attraction of the film is its visual inventiveness, which is shown in the representation of each friendly or angry animal put on screen, accompanied of large real environments as entire cities (film not wasted no chance, showing woods, metropolis, museums, farms and snow), police adventure of these two friends is more majestic due to this, really this factor is its charm. Directors Byron Howard and Rich Moore have worked for Disney before, in "Tangled" and "Wreck-It Ralph", but in "Zootopia" is where is that youth side and references of the current culture to highlight this project. The duo Nick and Judy is already indelible because their connectivity is surprisingly fast (more or less before going to see the movie) and the development of the case has its magic."Zootopia" may lack of originality in his final plot but the extravagant amount of animals with distinct personalities and its wonderful environments are a direct play to the children audience, not leaving aside to the adult public which gives them jokes and a legendary scene from "The Godfather". Disney has begun the year with right foot, leaving a film with teaching of tolerating and fight for your dreams with lots of the audiovisual quality. "Finding Dory" have to be perfect to snatch the title to "Zootopia" for the best film of the year. Having animals, Who want more movies of human?</fullReview>

As soon as I saw the trailer I went "yeah thats probably a movie that should be made" and here we are, and Im glad to say that Disney delivers once again! The voice acting is also spectacular in this film with J K Simmons, Idris Elba, and Jason Bateman, who should be doing a ton more voice work as he was great in Zootopia. This is honestly one of those franchises that deserves multiple sequels as there are plenty of ways they could go with where it is at now. There are certain parts that aren't too great for instance the plot twist i had predicted from the beginning and it was never really explained too in depth, but regardless it was still a great film, with a ton of witty humor, and maybe it was just my theatre, but I think children 4 and under won't enjoy this because it is smarter then it should be, which I really appreciate, because I know Disney could easily just make a colorful movie that kids would be locked into, but instead they create a great environment in this new animated feature, definitely check out Zootopia!

		<fullReview>Some recent animated films, like How to Train Your Dragon or Inside Out, combine visual appeal and strong moral or psychological insight. Zootopia does a little, but mostly it's a great looking film with a good, complex plot and very, very, funny. The different environments are nicely realized, especially where the two heroes, small by Zootopian standards, cross over into the rodent habitat and become giants who have to avoid crushing things. If you were going to make a movie about mammals living as humans, who would you have staffing the DMV? (Remember, turtles aren't mammals) Well, Zootopia nails it, hilariously. There are homages to The Godfather and Breaking Bad. The end credits rave scene is a tour de force of animation. A total blast.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A socially and politically conscious film from an unlikely source</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Disney's 55th animated feature film is a lively urban romp with great comedic timing and a mysterious, slightly neo-noir flair. In a nutshell, it's a lot of fun. However, Zootopia is somehow simultaneously one of the most seriously and politically relevant films of the year, greatly unexpected within a children's film from a studio built on dreams and magic. Disney leaves the magic, so to speak, at the door. Instead, we get the story of a little bunny's first time in the big city where she has to handle various characters, their differences and all the positive and negative ideals therein.The film does a fine job of blatantly dealing with current social issues that might normally be given a subtle nod or completely swept under the rug in a mainstream, animated film. Here, the idea that minorities are predators capable of being savage because of where they come from or that people from a certain area or background don't exactly get a fare chance in life is what actually makes the film. There is extreme prejudice and intolerance and even someone who believes they are fighting against it can still be prejudiced themself without even realizing it. There is a rampant and uncontrollable drug problem within the urban communities of the city, as well as missing people who are seemingly deemed unworthy of being found. And, of course, there is mob-like corruption within the ranks of the delightful animals. But there's a red herring. The film also shows that characters with naturally gruff demeanors can still be on the side of the good and characters that are innocent can still hustle and stand up for themselves.While the design of the film is indeed well done, from its characters to its locations, and the animation is top notch as usual, nothing visually stands out as being incredible. Disney is no stranger to anthropomorphized animals. In fact, some of the character designs in Zootopia borrow heavily from previous characters within the company. But, whether intentional or not, this all works to effect for the film. Having a city scape and characters that don't immediately stand out because they are seemingly familiar grounds the film into reality. This is any major melting pot of a city that these indifferences are happening in. And these are, symbolically, the same characters we come into contact with during our everyday.Having a DMV run by sloths shows that Zootopia does its fare share of playing up stereotypes as well, although it tries to break them by doing so. Some minor jokes, such as not touching someone's hair or using certain words that are only acceptable within a certain group of people, or even using a certain dialect, are included for specific audiences and the fact that they are there creates a feeling of specific inclusion. It is interesting, though, that in a film that speaks to the positive nature of opportunity and diversity, the voice cast still boasts typical actors in the major roles. Don't get me wrong, Ginnifer Goodwin and Jason Bateman as Judy and Nick respectively are great and definitely get the job done. Idris Elba, Tommy Chong, Octavia Spencer and Shakira, among a handful of others, are equally enjoyable and round out the diversity of the film's cast, but all in mostly minor roles.That is to say, it would be nice if a studio of Disney's caliber and reach could tell an animated story just like this, but without hiding behind furry animals that could be voiced by anyone, instead actually showing the differences and struggles of humanity with actual humans of difference races, creeds and backgrounds that we don't often get to see in animation. It's understandable, though, to use fuzzy bunnies and foxes to lighten the load of some of these harsh, real world themes in a children's movie. They also help in getting the movie to hit a bigger audience, which is important for this kind of story. Disney has indeed taken a major step forward with Zootopia, a socially and politically conscious film that probably no one ever expected from the mouse.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wild for Zootopia</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Maintaining a creepy mustache is a lifestyle choice. One of the unfortunate consequences of said lifestyle choice is being forced to feel awkward whenever you go see a children's movie, alone, in a dark theatre, filled to the brim with excited youths. Zootopia makes almost all of that awkwardness worth the trip.Judy Hopps (Ginnifer Goodwin) is an ambitious, young bunny, looking to prove herself as the first rabbit police officer in the bustling metropolis of Zootopia. Seen as little more than meek prey by her coworkers, peers, and even her family, she must learn to overcome these prejudices, and work with Nick Wilde (Jason Bateman), a cunning fox, to crack an impenetrable case.From Disney, you'd expect nothing less than top notch animation, and Zootopia undoubtedly delivers on that front. The colors are vibrant, playful, and inviting, as we move from dense, jungle rainforests, to blisteringly icy tundras, to urban cityscapes. The lighting, especially, is awe inspiring, specifically during Mr. Big's (Maurice LaMarche) daughter's wedding. It makes the entire sequence feel ethereal, if not like an altogether blatant homage to The Godfather.The voice acting, too, is excellent. Idris Elba is an intimidating presence as Chief Bogo, and Ginnifer Goodwin is totally endearing and lovable in a role that could have, in lesser hands, devolved into something saccharine and obnoxious. The real standout, however, is Jason Bateman, who consistently reminds me how he is one of the most versatile and underrated workhorses in Hollywood. He delivers a brassy, jaded performance, that is somehow imbued with the charisma and charm of a young Robert Redford. Bateman's Nick Wilde is a total dick, but goddamn it if I don't love that dick.As it claws tenaciously at greatness, Zootopia is tethered to the realm of merely good Disney films by its script. Sure, there are a handful of legitimately funny jokes (and one bizarrely out of place Breaking Bad reference) peppered in for some strong laughs, but the plot is generally predictable, and sticks to tried and true Disney formula. If that formula were perfectly executed, then all would be forgiven, but a sloppy, rushed third act, and an unbearably heavy-handed message that is handled with all of the nuance and discreetness with which crocodile might attack its prey, really hamper the film. It is almost cringe inducing at times, yet a slightly longer running time, and a little dialogue revision would have done the film a world of good.Don't let me scare you off, though. Zootopia is a fine film that definitely earns your money. Whether you're a parent looking for a cheap diversion that'll entertain you and your kids, or a student looking for a harmless, inoffensive flick to watch after midterms, you could do far worse. Just promise me you won't go see Gods of Egypt.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This animated movie can be appreciated both by children and grown-ups. It shows a cast of anthropomorphic animals living in a big town who are shaped and conceived like humans also in behaviour, virtues and vices. Their facial expressions and body movements are truly human and very varied. Their conception is full of imagination and originality. The story is very human also, simultaneously funny and thrilling: a conspiracy that tries to convince the town inhabitants that a biological change has occurred in predators till then peaceful making them again wild and dangerous. This conspiracy is investigated by the strange pair of a sly fox and a zealous rabbit police girl which results in some funny episodes. An enjoyable movie to spend a couple of hours watching it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Far more than just a cartoon</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While Zootopia was a very entertaining and pleasant surprise, it is far more than just an animated police procedural.I don't know how the Disney people did it, but Zootopia is a brilliant political allegory (and sadly I don't think I was able to satisfactorily define the term for my 7 year old grandson who just loved the sloths in the film). Somehow they anticipated today's politics with the government initiated outcasting of predator animals, losing their government jobs, being shifted to positions where they'd have no contact with the public. Somehow they anticipated a "new" politician ready, willing, and able to do to some animals pretty much what that monster Mr. Trump wishes to do to all Muslims. Somehow they anticipated the rampant stereotyping in which Mr. Trump engages.The political allegory enables this film to transcend its genre and make it a pretty important film given the sorry state of American politics today -- a state made all the more sorry by the GOP's race baiting, stereotyping, and general hatred of anybody who disagrees with it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you want your kids to "laugh out loud" during the movie but can learn something after it as well,this is the right movie for your family. People of all ages can see themselves in "Zootopia" because the characters both have the typical features of animals and the familiar traits of any human being. The film isn't wrong to say that carnivores are biologically inclined to want to eat herbivores, that bunny reproduce prolifically, the sloths are slow-moving, that you can take the fox out of the forest but you can't take the forest out of the fox. If you think about all this as an analogy for the world we live in and then ask yourself which ethnic or racial or societal groups are "predators" (cops,businessmen,bureaucrats) and which are "prey",you see the problem. "Zootopia" rubber stamps whatever world-view parents want to pass on to their kids,however embracing or malignant that may be. I can imagine an anti-racist and a racist coming out of the movie,each thinking it validates their sense of how the world works. "Only a bunny can call another bunny 'cute'" or "Never let them see that they get to you". "Zootopia" constantly asks its characters to look past stereotypes and not use sexist or racist language or repeat hurtful assumptions. This strongly reminded me of the case at Yale University during Halloween and the protest of its students about freedom of free-speech. Furthermore,"Zootopia" is visually stunning and full of cute animals with big eyes and voices of celebrities. The "Zootopia" canvas pops thanks to a gorgeously vibrant color palette and whimsical architectural scales. An all-mammal parallel universe is comprised of distinct micro-climates like sunny Bunnyburrows,icy Tundratown and self-explanatory Little Rodentia. Shakira's "Try Everything" is catchy and smartly relevant to the movie. It will never gain the level of popularity that "Let It Go" did, but I believe your kids will come out of the movie singing this song joyfully. As it is,"Zootopia" is a goodhearted, handsomely executed film that kids of this generation should adore,at least at the level that they did with "Frozen" and "Big Hero 6".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Zootopia</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I heard a lot of great things about this movie, not only from the critics or this website but also from some of my friends living abroad and who had the chance to see this movie weeks before me.So when it was finally released over here, I wanted to look by myself alongside one of my friends and her two children. And I loved it too.The first thing to say is Zootopia is a typical Disney Movie. It has this fairy side we find in each of their pictures, symbolized by this huge metropolis called Zootopia. It's a magical combination of several worlds connected to each other where animals of each sort, preys as predators, live in harmony and peace which is by the way another favorite Disney Theme.It has also this huge dose of cuteness throughout the characters of the movie starting with Judy, this cute young doe which wishes to be the first of her kind becoming a police officer. Something she succeeds to achieve through hard work and dedication, another familiar Disney theme (You can achieve anything if you believe in yourself). The other characters are as attaching especially Flash, a very funny sloth who is really irresistible in each scene he appears. Nick, Judy's partner is as adorable as her under his attitude of a tough guy is secretly hiding a fear of being rejected because he's a fox.But there is also something new, something we never see in a Disney cartoon before: The police investigation side. It's unexpectedly thrilling with its very noire ambiance, its characters scarier than usual but which still includes a certain sense of parody. As it's a Disney movie, nobody dies but it's still thrilling following Judy and Nick into their investigation which is very well built. I truly hope this side will be including in the next Disney movies.When the movie was finally over, I had a very great time and judging by how my friend's children were cheering and wishing to become cops when they'll be older, I can safely assume they did as well. It deserves the rave reviews it received worldwide. Zootopia is definitely a great surprise and a picture to see if you wish to enjoy an amazing family time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Zootopia is another great Walt Disney Animation Studios film? with surprisingly relevant messages on race, fear, and more.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In case you didn't already know, I really love animated movies. On top of being colorful, they're made to inspire and are built on a foundation of deep moral values. I love the great movies Walt Disney Animation Studios has put out in the last few years. Since Wreck It Ralph, I'd say everything Walt Disney Animation Studios release has even Pixar put to shame. While nobody can step up to Pixar when it comes to the visuals of animation..I'm really starting to respect Walt Disney Animation Studios when it comes to a collective movie. I'm happy that WDAS continues to make movies that I can start to approach with Pixar-Level expectations. Zootopia is another great Disney film? with surprisingly relevant messages on race, fear, and even the police. Below are some of my favorite/least favorite parts of Zootopia:MINOR Spoilers AHEAD+ Clever? clefurr? (no.)In Zootopia, all mammals have evolved into an intelligent anthropomorphic species (which basically means they're shaped like we are and can walk on two legs). Everything from train stations to restaurants are prepared to accommodate species of all shapes and sizes? from mice to elephants. It's interesting to see how things might operate if every intelligent beings on the Earth wasn't a human being.+ "Fear Always Works"90% of the population is made up of prey. The other 10% consists of predators. In a society so numerically unbalanced, fear is a weapon used to keep the Zootopian citizens in control. The politicians in Zootopia recognize that fear can be an effective method of changing society. One one end, Mayor Lionheart tries to hide viscous mammals to avoid a panic? meanwhile Bellweather tries to force a panic by converting the predators of Zootopia into savage beasts to fear. Which would effectively destroying their reputation(s).+ PrettyThe world of Zootopia is pretty. The movie was colorful, like? Monsters University colorful.+ Race Shouldn't MatterZootopia is a collection of races living together, not unlike the US?it's a melting pot of varying culture. Disney takes a positive stance on discrimination in a clever way that resonates with kids (and "adults", like myself.. yes I'm an adult). It's good timing by Disney to release a film with a message like this when our nation could use a lesson or two on tolerance and acceptance. At the end of the day, race is only biology.+ Judy Hopps and Nick WildeAlthough the two aren't technically partners, Judy and Nick have a fun (if not somewhat cliché) buddy-cop relationship. The try-hard hare, and sly fox make a fun combo. And going back to the race thing?. it can't be a coincidence that the duo is made up of two different species typically thought to be natural enemies.? Nick Wilde gets really mad, and then gets over it really quickAfter Nick finds out that Judy thinks it's fair to judge him because any predator could go savage at any time?he decides NOT to join the Zootpia PD after all. This is obviously a big decision, made because Judy hurt him by bringing his character into question based solely on his biology. Judy knew Nick always wanted to be good but he wasn't "allowed" to be good because society couldn't trust a fox. As a result, Judy and Nick part waysAfter some times passes, Judy figures everything out and runs to Nick. There's no doubt that Judy's heartfelt apology was genuine? but Nick seems to get over everything too quickly. I would have liked to hear Nick's thoughts on the situation before he decides to accept the apology and move past it as quickly as he did.However, as I just type this? I'm starting to wonder if this is actually a +. What good comes out of holding grudges? Good for you, Nick.?"Savage"It's the right word, I won't argue that. By definition "savage" is: (of an animal or force of nature) fierce, violent, and uncontrolled behavior. But I wish literally any other word was used to describe the non-evolved predator behaviors in Zootopia. The word "savage" has a new urban definition, and I couldn't get it out of my head.-Typical Characters / VillainsA stoner played by Tommy Chong. An "Itialian" mob boss. A mayor trying to cover everything up. In response to this, Redditor AlexReynard makes a good point: I think that may have been intentional too. We get just as many characters who break stereotypes as ones who live up to them. I thought that was intended, to send the message that, even though some people conform, you should be open to accepting those who don't. Overall Zootopia is great. The only things I didn't like about it are pretty trivial. I loved the movie, I loved Nick and Judy, and I loved the all messages within it. I hope I get to see more of them? and preferable not in the form of a Disney X-D cartoon I'll never watch. This is a day-one blu ray purchase for me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Walking into this movie I had VERY low hopes that I would be entertained. And by the end, I was brow-beating myself for judging this wonderful movie by it's cover! (A message the movie covers well) It was full of humor, full of entertainment, and with a message to boot. A rarity these days with movies having a over abundance of low-brow slapstick and toilet humor. The pop-culture references are going to be over the children's head (just the way some should) and in perfect place for the adults to catch it and say "Ahh, that was clever". Yet still showing more than enough to relate with child-like humor, that will keep even the most restless 5 yr old at attention. A movie that is supremely voiced by actors/actresses that matched their characters so well, that from now on I will see the characters in their next performances...Which is a great thing.I do recommend anyone to take the family to see this..a few times.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Best and Most Topical Kid's Movies in a Long Time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had no idea this movie would be as good as it is when I went into the theater. I figured it would be decent just because of the pedigree with people like Byron Howard and Rich Moore working on it but this turned out being one of the best children's films I've seen in a long time. It's also impressive just how topical some of these issues are that are dealt with in the story. If you haven't seen it yet then do yourself a favor and go out and watch it immediately. You won't regret it.Judy Hopps (Ginnifer Goodwin) is a young rabbit that has become the first rabbit ever to be accepted by Zootopia's police force. Zootopia is a city where all kinds of different animals live together in peace. Judy starts her new job on the force but is having trouble since everyone underestimates her since she's a tiny bunny rabbit. She finally gets the chance to prove herself when she's put in charge of a missing animals case. She teams up with a cunning fox named Nick Wilde (Jason Bateman) and goes out to find out where the animals are but ends up uncovering a plot to change Zootopia forever.This movie has an excellent cast but it feels like most of these high-profile children's films always do. Goodwin does an excellent job as the upbeat and personable Judy. She's extremely positive but there are plenty of scenes in the film where we see a side of Judy that's afraid of failure and eager to please her superiors. Bateman's Wilde is very calm and collected in most situations but he also has a more caring side and is defensive of his friends. It's great seeing the relationship these two build with one another throughout the movie. I also want to give kudos to Idris Elba's Chief Bogo and J.K. Simmons's Mayor Lionheart. These two characters easily steal every scene that they're in and are probably my favorite characters in the entire film.This movie has so many positives going for it that it's hard to think of anything wrong with the film. The animation is incredibly well done and there are tons of different locales to flesh out the adventure. The characters are incredibly likable and genuinely funny. Speaking of funny, the jokes will easily make the young ones laugh but I'm surprised how much of the humor is geared towards adults. The only thing I didn't really like about the film was the character of Gazelle and the music of Shakira. I don't have anything against the songs in the movie, it's just not really my type of music.The thing that really impressed me with the story was the way they dealt with prejudice. This is something that I wasn't expecting in a children's movie but the backbone of the plot deals with the different prejudices felt by the main characters. Judy, Nick, even Chief Bogo and a myriad of others all feel some degree of prejudice whether because they feel they're better than others or because they were wronged by another and ended up blaming an entire set of animals because of it. I don't want to spoil too much if you guys haven't watched the film yet but it is really interesting how they were able to integrate such a hot button issue into this movie.I can't recommend this film enough. I absolutely loved it and I thought it was easily one of the best family movies I've seen in a long time. My only complaint is that I didn't enjoy some of the songs in the film but literally everything else I absolutely adored. Take the kids or friends or whatever and go watch this heartwarming movie as soon as possible.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The people developing stories for Disney films have got it down to a science. Zootopia opens with a sequence designed to make you love its heroine right from the beginning and moves through the beats of the hero's journey so dexterously, it's over before you realize how it happened. Like Big Hero 6 and Wreck-It Ralph, it differs from the traditional content of Disney classics, taking us on an emotional journey through a completely unique sort of world rather than one from European fairy tales. The setting and characters are strong points--much of the comedy comes from the viewer's understanding of Judy and Nick's personalities rather than setting up and paying off gags. The plot is more like the complicated, twisting scripts we usually get from Pixar films, and like the best Pixar movies, everything ties together and fits logically (BH6 and WIR were able to do that notably well, also). There isn't a strong, memorable villain, but it probably didn't need one with two lead characters as likable as Judy and Nick. There weren't many songs, and it might not have a prince and princess, but I expect people will want to visit Zootopia again and again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How do they keep doing this?!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is actually getting scary right now. Ever since the Renaissance, they proved to make successful movies out of risky concepts. Movies like FROZEN and INSIDE OUT have given themselves a big challenge, but at the same time gives a wide array of ideas and depth and meaning, proving that these simple kids movies can resonate the same way, if not more, to adults. Now in ZOOTOPIA, the Mouse House have given themselves their boldest endeavor to date: creating a world entirely inhabited with anthropomorphic animals while also throwing jabs at an abundant supply of social commentary. The result is a smarter, more insightful, and even darker execution than we ever expect from Disney, while also being as charming, creative and at times heartwarming. And I will be damned that, even considering some missteps, this may not turn out to be one of the best movies of the year.The story centers around a rabbit named Judy Hopps who wishes to be a cop while being discouraged by the fact that they do not allow innocent prey as cops. Despite this, she proves to be cunning and willing enough to prove the world that she could save the world. She then earns her badge and is deployed to Zootopia, a New York Esq city filled with animals. Along her journey to rise above the ranks, she meets Nick Wilde, a sneaky fox who makes a living causing trouble with a personal scarring almost parallel to Hopps. While solving a case of a missing otter, they both team up to find him, all while delving into a much bleaker and more complex story that honestly needs to be seen rather than further explained.As expected with a premise like this, this movie goes full-force in its social allegory that resembles the world we live in today, an endeavor almost too risky to contemplate. In their universe, the predators and prey used to be on opposing sides until an act that makes them equal. Unfortunately, the predators now face overwhelming prejudice from a paranoid society, preventing them from shopping or being free from ridicule. Seriously! And it is quite apparent in his back story that Nick evidently lived his whole life with this.But that doesn't stop there. Without spoiling too much, a certain moment that might just be yet another forced conflict to transition to the third act, the movie then pulls out a wild card and turn this into a bigger issue: inventing said third act where the movie commentates on segregation, racial profiling, law enforcement with a compromised moral code, corrupt politicians, dirty secrets, and even the issues on mentally instability.WOW!Say what you want about Disney, they do NOT hold back on this. So much of this conflict is almost too rampant in our real world to bare, even for a kids movie. Thankfully, the movie knows its limits and keeps it accessible to the attended younger audience. That may be the strongest secret to this movie: It commentates on these issues while also tying into a rather coherent story and not have it over dominate the proceedings, thus making it preachy. And it all comes together in the finale, hopefully promoting a better future of equality, kindness, and everything else Martin Luther King preaches, thus benefiting itself into somehow being a more potent wake-up call than the utterly preachy and jumbled circle-jerk towards objectivism that was last years TOMORROWLAND. Even not considering all that though, the movie is also bursting with charisma and creativity that hovers. The movie brings extra detail into the practicality of how these animals inhabit Zootopia, thus creating a bunch of clever jokes as well. Hopps determined natured paired with Wilde's sly, quip-talking nature seemed too played out in other buddy-cop movies, but thankfully the script, however juvenile (it is a Disney movie after all), is tight enough to breathe these tropes onto its own. And yes it is worth noting that the voice acting from Idris Elba, Ginnifer Goodwin, Jason Bateman, etc. are all top-notch. There are a few missteps, though. It has been well-known that the new Disney movies like to play around with certain tropes of their own (FROZEN especially). Here they do quite a few of them, and some skews a little too on-the-nose. (see the movie to know what I am talking about). Even they do well with invoking some clever commentary with the animals, one in particular plays on for too long and serves little more than a DMV joke. The writing, however tight as usual, remains just enough to grasp for kiddies but fairs a little too obvious for me. To be fair, I expect that going into this movie, but I cannot shake occasional exposition that repeats plot points I already know. Small gripes notwithstanding, ZOOTOPIA is quite simply a revelation! A type of movie that turns the tired "buddy-buddy cop" story into something more thought-provoking than this company would usually allow. A movie that will both leave kids with their minds nourished and their parents' eyes open, it is smart, charming, and inspired. Finally, 2016 has its first great movie!Rating: 8/10 (GREAT)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thoughtful Movie with Some Ironic Mixed Messages</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really enjoyed Zootopia. The characterization and animation were simply top notch, and it was blessed with an interesting story-line that touched on many real life conundrums.But there was a number of amusing ironic counter messages that may slip under the radar.The first group related to Judy Hopps in police training:She is put in the boxing ring with rhino. The amusing thing is that she wins the bout only by completely defying the laws of physics. So anyone with a feel for physics realizes that the message is the exact opposite to intended, you can't win in real life. A more thoughtful approach would have been that Judy simply uses her natural speed and agility to avoid the rhino until it tires and cannot fight on (perhaps with some playful taunting), ending in a draw.The second message is evident when Judy is climbing the ice wall. The message is, "if you can't climb the ice wall yourself, do so on the backs of your classmates". An ironic and perhaps realistic unintended message.The third message is that unless you fit in to the expected characteristics for a school or job, you need to be the top of the class to succeed. There can be only on top of the class, so the odds aren't good. The second group of counter messages relates to "staying in your place like you are told":Judy saves pretty much saves the entire city from civil war, and her thanks is to keep her position as a police officer. They even rubbed her nose in it with the "parking duty" joke at the end. Perhaps that is what Judy would want, but the message is "stay in your place" not "anyone can be anything". The other counter message is "when the downtrodden get into power they behave even worse than the over-privileged". Perhaps this is even often true, but a counter-message nonetheless. Those downtrodden should stay in their place because they deserve it ;)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disney Made This?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first saw trailers for Zootopia, I didn't think the movie would be super amazing. I thought it would at least be decent. Most of Disney's animal movies fall under being good, but nothing too substantial. However, after watching Zootopia, I was proved wrong. Very wrong. So wrong, in fact, that I didn't even feel like I was watching a Disney movie.This is where the spoilers start to appear, so you've been warned. Zootopia has a lot of.....adult themes. Nothing too inappropriate, like sex or murder, but there are a surprising amount of rather serious issues such as racism, bullying, a little bit of violence (I believe they show a bit of blood a couple times), very subtle drug trading references, and they say "Oh my God" instead of "Oh my gosh". These things are why I felt like I wasn't watching a Disney film. It was pretty ballsy of them to include such things into their story. But y'know what? It all works. Racism plays a huge part in this film. It not only affected Judy Hopps' dream of wanting to be a cop, but Nick Wilde as well. His back story was rather tragic, and I actually was on the verge of crying when watching. I won't give away what happens to him in his past, but it's pretty dark, and pretty upsetting. I think it's up there with Bambi's mom getting shot.These themes, while smartly written, I think confused the younger audience. I heard one little boy complain about not wanting to watch the movie anymore, and that he wanted to go home. The other kids, though, asked occasional questions, and laughed when they were supposed to. So, I don't think your kids will be terribly confused, but many of the references they bring up, and some scenes of the movie may confuse them a bit. I would like to say that they won't be bored, but they may end up being bored with a few scenes mainly because they won't understand. Oh, and there are a few jump scares. They should be prepared for those as well.The characters are really fun to watch. I don't think I disliked anyone. Judy Hopps is a wonderful female protagonist who, while she is small, has a large heart. She's a dreamer who will go the distance to get what she wants. She's truly a likable character, and I love her. She's also the most adorable rabbit ever. Nick Wilde is a sly, cunning fox. He may start off as sarcastic and a bit rude, but trust me when I say that you'll grow to like him, especially because of his back story. There's more to him than you think. The side characters each have their charm, like Clawhauser, who's an adorable geek with a huge crush on a singer. Flash's name is very deceiving, since he is not fast at all. He's hilarious to watch, though. Bogo appears to be a tough, unsympathetic jerk in the beginning, but toward the end, we see him slowly change into a more likable character. The list goes on.I definitely would not say this is just a kids' film. I'm not even sure if young kids can appreciate it. I definitely would recommend this to maybe preteens and older. Adults will certainly get a kick out of most of the jokes, and appreciate the story more. Younger kids may appreciate the cute animals and few funny scenes, but the story may leave them puzzled or bore them. If you have young kids, and want to take them to see Zootopia, go ahead. It's a great family film, but just keep in mind that your kids may end up being a bit confused. As for adults, I definitely recommend it for any who are Disney/animation fans, or who like crime solving films. I promise you it won't disappoint. :)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all I thought this movie will end up with such a predictable plot. After thinking through while watching this movie, it has subliminal messages that says about racism, fascism, corruption, prejudice, and a lot of stuff that are not suitable for kids. Since it's okay because no kids will understand that.They're just laughing about a cuteness of the animals in this movie. Haha. So well, this movie is great, enjoyable, stunning animation! Best animation movie 2016 so far. Thanks Disney! Keep doing this kind of movie! I'll wait for that! And hell yeah, this is even better than Kung Fu Panda 3! Sorry Po! Skedoosh!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A pleasant surprise and a breath of fresh air for film animation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I walked into this movie completely blind; I had no idea what it was about, I had not watched any trailers, I have barely even heard of the movie beforehand. Boy, was I surprised.Zootopia's concept is very interesting; in a world full of animals, a bunny by the name of Judy Hopps (voiced by Ginnifer Goodwin), who had a dream of becoming the first bunny police officer in the urban megalopolis of Zootopia. Despite being the valedictorian of her class in her police schooling, she was made fun of by her coworkers due to her size and was given parking duty as her first job. While on the job, she meets a fox named Nick Wilde (voiced by Jason Bateman), who, while sly and deceptive at first, ends up helping Judy investigate a case of a missing citizen otter, a case that Judy took up on her own and was not formally assigned to. This case then escalates into a crazy conspiracy that is greatly affecting Zootopia, a conspiracy that Judy and Nick must solve together.The chemistry of Goodwin and Bateman are incredible; they work beautifully together as the two main characters of the film. Although Bateman's character is shown as a villain at the beginning of the film, once the film starts to uncover, you learn to like him more and more.Even the smaller sub-characters are very enjoyable. Maurice LaMarche's character, Mr. Big, is a hilarious Mafia-like crime boss; as an Italian, I found LaMarche's character possible the most enjoyable character in the entire film; with The Godfather and other Mafia references, it was a great addition to the film's plot. Clawhauser, a radio dispatcher and receptionist for the Zootopia Police Department voiced by Nate Torrence is extremely lovable the moment the film introduces the viewer to him. Flash, the sloth working in the DMV (Department of Mammal Vehicles) is also a hilarious character voiced by The Simpsons director Raymond S. Persi. There are even more great voice actors that make for one hell of a cast.The animation is absolutely stunning. It is insane how much detail was put into the art of this film; it almost looks like real life! Some of the best animation I've ever seen in a film. As an adult, I enjoyed this film quite a bit. Even with its G rating, it has an immersive plot with plenty of scenes that will have you laughing, and then soon after have you on the edge of your seat. I wouldn't even consider it a children's movie; there are multiple concepts and references that young children would not get. I was very surprised how suspenseful the film could be at times. Disney killed it yet again. Zootopia is one of the best films they've ever put out, and perhaps one of the best animated films to ever be made. This is a film that almost anyone can enjoy. Don't let the cutesy appearance fool you; Zootopia is a beautiful, suspenseful, funny and deep film. I will personally be disappointed if this does not win an Academy Award.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great choice for entertainment.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My boyfriend and I decided to give this movie a try because the previews looked good. It was one of those movies we weren't super excited about seeing, but we didn't think it would be an entire waste of time.We were happy we went. It was well worth its 108 minutes' length.This movie was wonderful. It kept our interest throughout every thrilling, comical, emotional, unraveling moment. We like to predict the movies we see as it unfolds before us. Even though this is a "kids" movie, it kept surprising us with its twists and turns. The voice acting was spot on; Ginnifer and Jason were a delightful duo. The CGI was lovely to see, and the plot was never dull. If you and your family are looking for some great entertainment, look no further. This is a movie we'll be buying as soon as it comes out on DVD. If Zootopia is any indication of this year's animation films, we're in for exciting year full of potential.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Excellent Anthropomorphic Classic for the Ages</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fresh from Disney is one of the newest largely anticipated release to add to the collection of classics released over the decades. In Zootopia, there is a world full of animals where humans never happened, naturally the animals evolved over the years and formed societies of their own. The actual city of 'Zootopia' is not the only such places as there are multiple smaller towns surrounding the metropolis, Judy Hopps being from Bunny Borough herself, but there is an implicit tone that there are other small communities similar to that one all over the world. Without getting into any plot to avoid spoilers, the overall message of this movie is acceptance and overcoming obstacles. Being set in a fictional world with many different species and backgrounds of animals, a primary focus is dealing with various xenophobic tendencies. Everyone faces certain species-ist reactions and societal views, but being Disney they chose a positive message for the overall tone. Like the old classics such as Robin Hood or The Aristocats, it deals with issues that exist in the real world while not being reminiscent of them. While prejudice and xenophobia do also exist in our world, the problems and feelings found in Zootopia are all their own. Being set in a fiction the films character and plot are all self contained and you don't need to be privy to any particular issues of our time. Personally it was refreshing to see a movie with a clear message of good will without referring to ongoing real world issues which would cloud our judgment or try to over analyse the plot. After seeing it a few times I enjoyed it even more and found the message of moving forward and making the world a better place suitable for all ages, both the young who want to feel good about the world, and the older who can appreciate the absolute hopefulness found in the endearing characters and their relations. At the end of the day this is a feel-good romp around a vibrant and fresh world which will undoubtedly be cherished by all ages for the years to come.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Continuing Disney's New Golden Age</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Walt Disney Animation Studios, in the decade from 1989 to 1999, produced some of the Western world's most cherished and culturally significant films: The Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin, the Lion King, Pocahontas, Mulan, and Tarzan. Not only were these films artistic masterpieces, but they in many ways captured the zeitgeist of their era - the "Disney Renaissance".Following a tumultuous transition to computer animation, since the release of Tangled in 2010, we are currently amidst Disney's triumphant return to form as an animation studio peerless in its technical animation and narrative prowess. Tangled, Wreck-It Ralph, Frozen, and now Zootopia, all demonstrate the studio's remarkable ability to combine spectacular visual pieces of art with storytelling that both inform and are informed by the cultural dialogue of the time.Frozen proved to be a cultural phenomenon for this reason, and deservedly so. Yet with Zootopia, Disney has surpassed anything it has previously produced during this new post-Tangled "Golden Era" - its computer animation has never been so breathtaking, its writing has never been so on point, and its messaging has never been so timely.In terms of its artistic wizardry, Zootopia surpasses the high bars set by Disney's previous work Big Hero 6 and Dreamworks's How to Train Your Dragon 2. The environments are rendered with such sumptuous detail and inspired creativity that, counter-intuitively, one almost forgets you're watching a computer animated film. The movie does not strive towards photo-realism - the aesthetic is definitely stylized - and yet many scenes exude so much detail that they almost become photo realistic. The introductory tour through the city of Zootopia, as the camera speeds through its various biomes, is a marvel of animation and world-building. Combined with the smart and often surprisingly mature dialogue, Zootopia very may well be a brilliant live-action cop mystery/drama.The dynamic detective duo of Judy Hopps and Nick Wilde serves as the narrative anchor and emotional core of the film. Voiced perfectly by Ginnifer Goodwin and Jason Bateman respectively, the chemistry between the two supplies their friendly relationship with much of its emotional weight and attractiveness. Dialogue throughout the film is clever and often uproariously funny, easily sustaining interest in the movie's story.On these grounds alone, Zootopia would be an excellent entry into Disney's repertoire. The film's underlying message, however, propels it to even greater heights. Animated movies are no strangers to anthropomorphic animals, but Zootopia leverages this device to its full potential and asks the viewer to consider important questions about race relations, prejudice, and stereotyping without his or her real world preconceptions and associated baggage. Released in the first quarter of 2016, this discussion could not be more important given given the politics and current affairs of both the United States and Europe.The easy course for this discussion would have been to follow the struggles of a minority group within Zootopia's inhabitants, which then would map onto a real world disadvantaged group and the challenges they face. In a real show of ingenuity in creative writing, Zootopia avoids this simplistic path completely. There is no clear-cut oppressor and oppressed, no abuser and victim, no privileged and disadvantaged. Instead, the movie wants us to think about the core challenges presented by prejudice and discrimination on their own terms within a world where, much like ours, such distinctions between groups often can be highly fluid and contextual.The predators of Zootopia struggle to escape their prehistorical roots as the oppressing class of species in a universe where the animal kingdom has biologically evolved far beyond this - appeals to "biology" in favour of the dominance of predators are just as flawed as their real-world racial parallels. Yet simultaneously, predators are also a minority within Zootopia, and are shown to be equally capable of being the victims of prejudice, stereotyping, media sensationalism, and dog-whistle politics. Zootopia shows just how complex, messy, and intractable these conflicts are. Things simply cannot be distilled down to, "Here's the dominant group, here's the group that they're discriminating against. Look how awful it is..." With this sharp commentary, Zootopia is the product of Disney firing on all cylinders. If there was still doubt as to whether we indeed are in the midst of a resurgent Golden Era for the studio, this film firmly quashes it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Easily an Animated Classic; Best Disney Film Since The Lion King (1994)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Zootopia is directed by Byron Howard, Rich Moore, and Jared Bush, and stars Ginnifer Goodwin as Judy Hopps, a bunny rabbit that lives in a world in which animals are civilized, and live in cities together. She dreams of being a police officer in a big city called Zootopia, even though all of her peers, including her parents, try to keep her under the "status quo," in which she is just a simple carrot farmer. She disagrees with this, and becomes a police officer, yet realizes that she was handed a case bigger than she could imagine; a case she must solve with the help of a sly fox named Nick Wilde (Jason Bateman).To begin, Zootopia is hands down the best Disney film since The Lion King (1994). Everything about this movie was utterly amazing, and surprised me in so many ways. The underlying tone and themes, the characters, the plot, the voice acting, and the animation. First, the primary themes in the film are actually very dark and deep. There's symbolism of racism, sexism, drugs, and even what American is supposed to stand for, yet fails at doing. All of these themes play across perfectly, and are very surprising in a children's movie.The characters and plot in this film are both equally perfect. The plot shows that anybody can be anything, and the characters describe this so very well. All of the characters are very interesting, and three-dimensional in ways that are subtle, yet obvious once the film all come together. Each character has a great arc throughout the movie, and learns a lesson through experiences and other characters they meet.The voice acting is this film is rare. I mean this by saying the the voice acting is absolutely perfect. There isn't a single flaw with the acting, and each actor portrays their character amazingly. Jason Bateman as Nick Wilde was a perfect casting choice, although it didn't seem that way prior to viewing the film. Ginnifer Goodwin as Judy Hopps was also amazing, and brought the character to life in such a way that is near impossible for an animated movie. Idris Elba as Police Chief Bobo is also fantastic. He depicts a hardened police officer is a way I never would have thought of. Even Shakira does really good in this movie, which is something I never thought I would say.The animation in Zootopia is also top notch. Every tiny, seemingly insignificant movement, by any and every character, flows flawlessly with the background, and looks absolutely perfect. All of the animation is ultimately impeccable.Overall, Zootopia is an amazing film that children will love seeing, along with their parents or older siblings. It will easily be known as a Disney classic in 20 years or so, due to the animation, characters, acting, and intense plot. Zootopia deserves an A+, or a 10 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Zootopia is an excellent offering from Disney to all its fan. This is a very well appreciated movie in 2016. Disney got perfect start in 2016 with all types of mixed emotions in this movie. I found Nick as the coolest character and loved its style and looks. Sly fox turned out to the most piratical mind in this world, could be counted as the most smartest mind. Cleverness of Nick was just superb. Pretty and cute Judy, was unstoppable on her way to try everything and achieve it. I count this as must watch movie for wide spectrum of audience. This has got something for everyone. Good piece of refreshment. Most colorful art and perfection will catch your sight.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What do you get when you take the humor and child friendliness of Disney/Pixar and mix in a little "Traffic"? You get this gem of a film. It is astonishingly relevant to American, and World for that matter, sociopolitics. You can see it all here: the mistrust of African Americans, Trump's manipulation of the fear of Muslim and Hispanic immigrants.... It's all here, and being portrayed so frighteningly accurately.One of the things that I particularly found interesting was the use of references, humor, and music to balance out the seriousness and suspense: it's effect being to force us (the audience) to think about the issues in the world around us, while still making an enjoyable and inspiring film for family members of all ages, religions, and races.</fullReview>

I think the movie showed us the process of making dreams come true and some treasured spirit such as brave,unite together, justice;it also tell us the story about friendship(love)between nick and Judy (which touched me when Judy found the flowers and apologize to nick). In the other hand,this movie is full of laugh line,it made the movie interesting,it also made the character both lively and cute which can be more attractive foe female viewer. After all,I think this is the best movie that Disney had after 2010s, and it's even better than INSIDE OUT last year.I believe that ZOOTOPIA can be a part of next year's Oscar prize.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best animations of All-Time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Without a doubt, Zootopia is one of the best animations of All-Time and certainly one of the greatest from The Walt Disney Company. The characters, especially Judy Hopps, are absolutely great! You can't help but love them, and viewers of all ages will certainly be able to relate. This is a movie which can be viewed by any, and enjoyed by any. I believe it will go down as one of the best to date, and I am quite confident that there will be plenty more in this series. I will go as far as saying that Judy Hopps will become a great addition to Disney as a whole. Her creation is absolute genius. Without spoiling anything, I will say this, you will leave the theater feeling pure joy. And might I say, surprised to some extent. The story is written beautifully and engages the viewer more than any animation I've seen within the past few years or so. This is most certainly the best animation of 2016 yet. Disney has done it again, and believe me, this is going to be a big one. Please give it a watch because you will love it. Don't let your age stop you, this is a fantastic movie for anyone of all ages and proves yet again, Disney is one of the best studios in the business when it comes to producing films that everyone can enjoy and relate to. Zootopia gets a 10 out of 10 in my book. And I feel absolutely confident saying such, and believe me, that's a rating that I do not give very easily at all. But this one deserves it. I'll put it along the likes of Toy Story, it is that good. Don't wait, get to the theater and watch it today! Go! You will not be disappointed. Well done, Disney. Can't wait to see more from this series.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Who says family films only have children to preach to? Well, actually I'm not entirely sure if anyone's ever said that, but it sure sounds like they would though, huh? That debate aside, Disney gets it with its newest installment. Without sounding cliché and trite, Zootopia is literally fun for the whole family. It takes place in a world where animals, both predator and prey, live together in harmony-- except not really. Although things have seemed to change, all the animals still have their reservations and fears about one another. Obviously mirroring a place where our own society is right now, as far as race and religion. The whole movie features various species facing intolerance, while digging into and showcasing possible responses to the prejudices against them--perhaps containing the true depth within this film. The themes are obvious to the adults, but subliminal to the kids. Which is a good thing. It deals with a dark subject matter, and the filmmakers aren't afraid to give us that respective tone either.The main character is Officer Judy Hopps (Ginnifer Goodwin), a bunny rabbit who is finally living her dream of being a police officer in the big city. But she faces adversity since the job is usually held by rhinos or elephants. She's given a case where she has to find an otter who's gone missing--a mystery that adds another fun feature to an already interesting concept. However, it doesn't come until about 35 minutes in--right when you're starting to wonder to yourself what the setup is for.In a refreshing fashion, the writers aren't talking down to their younger audience. It's funny without being over-the-top and irreverent. When the jokes don't work as well, it's never in an embarrassing way. In fact, there may even be more jokes for the adults in this one. However, there are plenty of aesthetic visuals to keep the children entertained for the full runtimeAnimation alone, Zootopia is beautifully detailed. There's so much of it that it's not even possible to see it all in one sitting. And while you're watching it, you wish there were a place just like it where you could visit as soon as the movie finishes.Twizard Rating: 99</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Reasons why I am addicted to Nick Wild</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>3/14/2016 If there is a movie I will give 10 over 5, it must be this one! Zootopia 100% copied the background of New York, where says everything is possible to happen here. There is no any other city will look like New York, millions of immigrants come, in searching their dreams. But how many people really get what they want? That is really amusing the movie call zootopia since we all know Utopia, it is the imagined place of perfect. And we also know America is a culture mix pot in the world, especially in New York and California, we are the cities built on immigrants. However racism still exist, even in New York, or maybe we call it the micro-aggression. For example, any immigrant been though, people always bring up a topic or question about your country, like: "how/why/what your country ...., do they balabala...";"your country's people are (adj., either good nor bad describe) or balabala" Those questions are pretty often happen, right? They are nice culture shocks in the beginning, so people can share the differences with other. However, what happen if this goes for years and years? More personal example like two weeks ago, I went to a Spanish neighborhood local grocery store to buy rice, while I was browsing in the white rice section, the store guy came and pointed at some bags of rice, said: "this rice is for Chinese, those for Spanish..." I felt so awkward at that time; I was just checking the prices and the packet's information. And they are all white rice, I can tell all of them were produced in America. So if I really need to purchase a specific Chinese rice, I will go to Chinatown. Come on, all rice originally came from Asia in historical; and people who cook rice either Spanish or Asian, they should know adding appropriate water is much more important. More than this, sometimes I met strangers on the street will say Chinese hello "Nei hoo", which is nice, in the beginning when I just met some. But I found out later, some of them only know a few words of Chinese, and they say Chinese hello to every Asian, because they unconsciously assume all the Asian faces are Chinese, and some of them can't even tell the differences between China and Japan, Korean, Thailand, Vietnamese, etc. There though either people mention your country with comprising or insulting, or maybe they just want to know the differences between your country and their country. People just unconsciously thought you are a foreigner, and "you" are not one of "us". They think you are "different" with an unconscious mind. And people think this is normal because they are not willful to say that. Some people might know this, if they do research, or in some specify class conversation, or we may know this from some social topics on the news. Otherwise, we all unwittingly being racist. Back to the movie and the character. All the things I mention above, I just want to tell you why I fall in love with Nick Wilde. He is sly, but he is so cute, so adorable to me. I wish I have a friend like this, or maybe I wish I can be a person like him ; who grow up with troubled history, and grew to be cynical, devious, and prejudiced. But still keep his positive of the world after all the cruel. Besides, he made $200 a day! Whoa! What a smart fox! And he even evades the taxes, lmao, we all know how many taxes in US., how annoying to file the tax form. And Judy is much smarter than Nick, I laughed so hard when Judy said Nick is under arrest because he pay no taxes on the tax form. She caught Nick so many times, for so many reasons/treats to ask/force him to help; and kept the story goes on. "It is called the hustle, sweetheart." Can't stop laughing every time when this line appeared. I have so many things can say about Zootopia and its character. However sometimes it is difficult to put minds into words. One sentence to view is: this is a good movie! I cant wait to see the sequel! OK, that is two sentences, tee hee. At the last, am I the only one who thinking seriously about the mix-blood of fox and bunny? And if Zootopia just a buddy movie, and Nick and Judy are not couple, then the screenwriter should STOP WRITE this kind of lines: "You Know You Love Me" "Do I know that? Yes. Yes, I do."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Zootopia is an animation movie directed by Bryon Howard and Rich Moore and produced by Walt Disney animation studios.After the movie like Big Hero 6 or Frozen, here Walt Disney have decided to set the bar high. There is not only one message on this movie but many little messages during all the film, But he mainly criticizes with humor the society in which we live.In this film we follow the adventures of judy hopps, a young rabbit freshly graduated in the police. She is the first rabbit who has obtained this post. After many adventures, she sees herself in charge of an investigation she will take to heart to resolve this problem to prove that she has his own place in the police.In this film we clearly recognize the artistic touch of Disney, which is often known for making films for children. This is not the case here, zootopia is an animated film that speaks to everyone and not only for children, especially with this nude scene in the movie.I urge those who have not seen it yet, watch it because in my opinion, it is one of the best animated film of Disney, if not the best.</fullReview>

It makes fun of racial divisions, political ridiculousness, and the important lesson for children that you do not have to be what society claims you are.It is so refreshing to have someone make a film for children that isn't the usual "everyone is a princess" drivel.I would give this film 11 stars if I could!</fullReview>

It is what more animated movies should aspire to be. It is a movie where i can take a 8-10 yr old and still both of us would end up having fun (Pixar does not make such movies anymore). The characters of Zootopia were awesome. The 3D was spectacular. The story pace beautiful. So kudos to Disney. A job well Done.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I normally only use the term "delightful" when referring to my 2 year old granddaughter, but this film deserves it. The animated story about a bunny named Judy Hopps who aspires to "make the world a better place" (by becoming a police officer in Zootopia) is heartwarming and hilarious.Of course, animation today is breathtaking and this movie is no exception. My wife and I agreed that one of our favorite parts of the show was the train ride into Zootopia - which displays many different ecosystems and wildly different climates. It is spectacular.But this is both a character and message driven story. The main character Judy is lovable, but resolute in her desire to improve the world she lives in. It is wonderful to see her bounce back from betrayals, trials and tribulations. And even when she experiences success, acclaim and fame - her character is tested - and she comes out on top. You really need to see it to know what I am talking about.A number of different movie genres are utilized: a mystery, detective story with homages to "The Godfather" and "Breaking Bad" are all very cleverly done. The movie also addresses the effects of prejudice and fear - and the way they can destroy relationships. The message for children (and adults) is strong about not giving up your dream - even when all those around you are doubting you - and even trying to make you fail. Humor that adults can also enjoy has become a staple of movies like these - and Zootopia hits a home run in this area. There are many funny lines throughout the movie, but the scene at the Dept of Motor Vehicles made the entire audience laugh out loud. It was my wife's and my favorite.In all the years I have been reviewing movies that I love (or hate), this is the first animated film I have reviewed. My 9 year and 5 year old grandchildren loved it - as did my wife and I. We walked out of the film saying "We cannot wait to buy this movie!" Need I say more?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I knew it was going to be good but I didn't know I was going to like it as much as I did. The trailers don't do it justice, but do the great thing of not revealing a single story detail. I went in completely not knowing what the plot was, aside from the basics.The animation was incredibly beautiful to look at, it was really funny, and really cute when it needed to be. The music was great, the voice acting was perfect.It overall sends a great message that is needed in today's society, without going into too much detail as to spoil the fun. Seriously, give this one a chance if you haven't already. It most likely won't be what you expect.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Like an adult movie with talking animals in it, Zootopia reminds audiences how mature and dark animation can be</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First, let me say that this film does NOT preach social justice or feminism. This film is not an allegory for racism/sexism, but is however applicable to them. It is not preachy, nor is it liberal propaganda; far from it, and this is coming from a person who severely dislikes such films. Now let's get to this film. Zootopia is, if you don't know, about a rabbit named Judy Hopps (voiced by Ginnifer Goodwin) who, despite her parents' and peers' opinions, becomes the first ever rabbit police officer in a city called Zootopia, where both predators and prey get along. On her first day, she is assigned a Missing Animal case, and her only lead is a sly fox named Nick Wilde (Jason Bateman). Don't listen to the trailers and plot summaries that make this film seem like a cute talking animal film. This movie is one of the most darkest and mature animated films I have ever seen, and I have seen a lot. Mentioned before, this film deals with sexism (though not as much), drugs, trusting one another, bullying and believing in yourself regardless of the odds, as well as it's biggest moral which is racial profiling and prejudice. And it isn't lightly handled either; the "species-sm" (as the director called it) in this film is heartbreaking. A part of the movie was spoiled for me prior to the film, and yet said scene still made my heart malfunction in sorrow. This film is very timely-yet-timeless about how gray the topic of racism actually is in a modern society. Even without making real-life connections, the movie is still amazingly entertaining. The world of Zootopia looks beautiful. The animation in this film is jaw-dropping, and the world is so well thought-out and interesting. You almost get angry when the film doesn't let you enjoy certain landscapes, and that's due to the film's very fast-paced plot that for some reason still finds time in giving us sweet and humble moments. Plus, the story is very well- done, you really feel invested in what's happening with the characters and city, and it's almost like you are experiencing the movie unfold at that moment; like everything that is happening is happening right at that second.The characters of this movie are wonderful. It's supporting cast is very nice, with Idris Elba as a cliché Buffalo cop, J.K Simmons as Mayor of Zootopia, and more. But the spotlight shines on the main characters, Judy Hopps and Nick Wilde. Their relationship stays platonic, however they have better chemistry than most Disney couples. Both of them have their own flaws, and Nick and Judy know this about each other and accept it. They are by no means perfect, and that's why they are so relatable. Plus, they speak as if they are adults. Their is a scene where Judy calls Nick "very articulate for a fox" which is very applicable and is surprisingly articulate for an animated film. They speak to each other in a very mature way, which only helps make their bond even more enjoyable to see. And who could forget the voice acting? Ginnifer Goodwin and Jason Bateman give absolutely extraordinary performances in this film. I was so shocked to see how they spoke to each other because the voices were so genuine and in the moment. All the characters were great, but the main two were simply amazing. This film has great messages about racism, racial profiling, and prejudice. It captures it all in ways no animated film has ever done. Top it off with great animation, story, and astonishing characters, and you have a film that stands with the animated classics. I highly recommend seeing this film, it is truly amazing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun movie everyone can enjoy with a very timely message</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Anyone thinking that the creators had the issues of present in mind doesn't really understand what is involved in the process of making animated movies. That said, this movie does include a great message of prejudices and not only how one can be affected by them externally but how even the most well-meaning of people can be prejudiced. This is all done without being heavy handed or preachy. The story is a great buddy movie with crime thriller/neo-noir inspiration. The animation is vibrant, creative, and detailed and the world building that goes into the movie is just fantastic. My only nitpick is that I do wish we got to spend a little more time in the districts and get a look at the different environments surrounding Zootopia. The humor is great and never devolves into lowest common denominator.I will say this is a well earned PG. There are some tough scenes (including that of bullying) and a couple of intense/scary action scenes. Overall, Zootopia is a movie that adults &amp; kids alike can enjoy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A heavy-handed allegorical story about racism that isn't for young kids.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had high expectations for this movie and it did rather well in a few areas: I liked the animation, I liked the world-building (Zootopia is a cool place to visit), I liked the main characters (Judy Hopps, the first bunny police officer, and Nick Wilde, a fox who earns his living by hustling others although they don't explain why he can't easily pay for his elephant-sized popsicles when clearly he makes a good profit daily), and the action sequences were fun to watch.But the heavy-handed allegory about racism is just too contrived and I don't think it works that well here. I don't think any kids under age 8 will understand the message and their are a few scenes that are probably too frightening for small children. There is a scene that is reminiscent of the "Silence Of The Lambs" insane asylum that will probably give little kids nightmares. The message of racism seems to be more directed at the parents who bring their kids to this movie. I think racism is better approached by using human characters as the anthropomorphic animals added a layer of confusion especially for kids. There is one scene where another animal species calls the bunny "cute" and the bunny quickly says that that is not OK for other species to call it "cute" unless you're another bunny. This is obviously a direct reference to the N-word but it fails to convey a good message in two ways: 1. it doesn't make sense for "cute" to be an insulting word in the context, and 2. the use of the N-word in any culture should be criticized and not just people who are not black. The other message of try and do not give up also does not seem to be balanced as the message of you can be anything you want to be does not seem to be tempered by a realistic self-awareness. Even though it does try hard to make serious light of some issues it actually supports stereotypes. The "sneaky" fox, the "evil" weasel, and the "bullys" who manifest in larger animals. There are many jokes that just fall flat like the "nudist" club, the sloths at the DMV, etc... It really didn't make me laugh at all except for maybe a few smile-worthy sight gags.The movie had a good flow to it and if you're a person that loves animation and has to see all of Disney's stuff then go for it otherwise I cannot recommend it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Zootopia Would Never Put Up a "Yuge" Wall</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Disney's most recent Animated Classic Zootopia is already a giant hit, critically and financially. Its mixture of broad humor, undeniable spirit, and timely / timeless themes of inclusivity and acceptance make it easy to see why. Is Zootopia's message a bit on-the-nose? Oh, yeah. (What's the exaggerated version of that term? IN ?the nose? FROM-the-nose? The-nose-itself?). At times that insistence to wear its thoughts on its sleeve can be distracting. However, this is morally-upstanding entertainment made for children, and if we remember that, it becomes not only enjoyable but even admirable. Judy Hopps (Goodwin) is at the center of this fish-out-of-water (better yet, bunny-out-of-town) tale, as Zootopia's (a species-melding-pot metropolis) first rabbit police officer on her first case, helped by conniving-insider fox Nick. What follows is a mystery tale that, while juvenile, is full of fun references and absolutely amazing world-building. At times, it may test your limits on animal-based wordplay, but its ubiquitous cuteness (a term coined "offensive to the bunny community") and strongly expressive animation make it difficult to dislike. Along the journey, we encounter numerous classes of animals, each representing both the silly stereotypes of their "animal-race", while smartly standing in for human biases and prejudices. What's truly noble about that blunt messaging is it doesn't deny the disparities between us or claim that "color-blindness" is the path to a less-bigoted world. It's more an indictment of fear as a means of power, something we know all too well, encouraging us to recognize our differences and use them as a support instead of a weight. On-the-nose or not, that is a message worth implanting in every American, both child and adult.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of Disney's best and flawless animated films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Zootopia" is Disney's 55th full length animated feature. it is directed by Rich Moore, and Byron Howard. it stars Ginnifer Goodwin and Jason Bateman as a bunny named Judy Hopps, and a fast talking scam artist fox named Nick Wilde. the film takes place in an animated world where predator and prey live together in peace and harmony in a city known as Zootopia. Judy Hopps (played by Ginnifer Goodwin) is the first bunny officer in the Zootopia police department or ZPD. when an otter goes missing she has to team up with a fast talking scam artist fox named Nick Wilde (played by Jason Bateman) who is a key witness to the crime, in order to solve the case.I'm gonna tell you right off the bat that this movie is Flawless. it is an amazing movie with great characters, a great story, great writing, great jokes, and great animation. it even has lessons about prejudice, racism, and the judgment of other people based on what they are or what they look like. it covers every problem facing our world today and the way the filmmakers did it is perfect, but I'll talk more about that later.The characters are amazing and the way they work off each other is amazingly well done. Judy Hopps is a great female character, as well as Nick Wilde who is a great male character and the way they work off each other is fantastic. Their back stories very well tie in with their character and how they operate in this world from the past to the present. the other side characters are great and have a purpose to be in the story. there is a villain reveal in this movie, and I am not telling you who the villain is because that would be a spoiler but he/she is a great villain with a great diabolical plan. The story is very original and to recall, I don't think Disney has ever done a story relating to prejudice and racism before in their animated features, which is a tough subject to successfully pull off, and they did it very well here. it touched on every subject to seriously talk about that's happening to this world.The Animation is very well detailed, rendered, and animated and the designs don't feel out of place in the world that they live in. it's amazing to watch and beautiful to look at and easy to identify characters with their design. The soundtrack is very well composed as it is written by Michael Giacchino who composed other Disney works like the incredibles and ratatouille. to end off on a high note this movie is one of Disney's perfect animated films that succeeds in every level of creativity. 10/10-5 stars out of 5 Disney's best animated film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An adult Movie in camouflage</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Zootopia is a Disney movie so it goes without saying that it will be BEAUTIFUL! But it's something else as well, this is a smart movie with clever writing and some very adult jokes sneaked in there but it'll take you a second to get them. ExampleThe bunny is doing some math to calculate taxes, in the middle of of the equation she says "and because bunnies are good at multiplying we carry the four and ....etc" I laughed at the joke but it went by so fast that my group missed it and it took them a minute to get it.Is this a good movie? Yes, yes it is... but.... the message is hammed in and it's such a basic message that even a child knows. Racism is bad, don't judge people on racial stereotypes. It's a good message and the movie does deliver it in a clever way, but it could have been better, the children in the theater were getting bored and antsy mid way through which is never a good sign for a movie aimed at kids (marketing wise)To me this felt more like a movie aimed at adults but because of the Disney name had to wear kid friendly camouflage.Give it a go but expect to like it more then your kids will.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Zootopia is nothing like your regular Disney fare. Sure it's got cute talking animals, some childish humor, and like almost all Disney movies it is gorgeously animated and has a lesson to teach, but not just to kids. This movie absolutely blew me away from the moment it began. The messages and lessons that this film has to tell are so beyond it's years, there were many times that I just forgot that I was watching an animated film about a bunny who wanted to a cop. I believe that this Disney has struck gold with this movie, not just in the terms that Disney will make bank loads of money from ticket sales and merchandise (cause it will), but because they created a truly well crafted, well written, and beautifully, breathtakingly animated film that is sure to delight children and entice their parents. Please go see Zootopia because it IS like nothing you've seen Be-fur.Source: http://www.livingfilms.org/zootopia-2016/3552</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Vibrantly humorous and infectiously uplifting, "Zootopia" is the quintessential Disney's animation and a surprisingly good crime drama.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After the tale of two princesses in wintry landscape, action sci-fi with cuddly robot, and now enchanting buddy cop movie with bunny and fox, I will never doubt Disney again. There's something legitimate magical there, as it never fails to bring an ageless spectacle of witty humor, great visual and charming characters. "Zootopia" is not only a nice story with social commentary, it's also a detective, dare I say, thriller, which is unexpectedly crazy and brilliant.Judy Hopps (Ginnifer Goodwin) is a spirited bunny with one goal in mind; to become a cop, despite whatever her size and other might tell her. Her chirpy nature makes it near impossible not to cheer for her, and this might be the most delightful bunny in decades not named Bugs. Her peculiar partner in crime is Nick Wilde (Jason Bateman) who is a con man with possible golden heart hidden inside his shifty golden fur. He's a contrast to Judy, a more realistic type and using sly wit to overcome striking prejudice.These two have excellent chemistry, in a crime thriller style no less. Disney is well known to incorporate action nowadays, but full-fledged detective work, it's mental that this works tremendously well. The pacing moves in haste, and still giving enough hints for the noir to move nicely and the audience to follow it closely. The atmosphere can be dark at several occasions to create dread, yet never too overwhelming for its family friendly nature.Visual is good as expected, it's a nice set-up for animal kingdoms, in the urban environment. There are multiple references for pop and modern culture, in fact some of the jokes come in form of familiar daily life routines. The other bulk is in the expense of Judy as she hits speed bump along the way to accomplish her dream. Still, what could be somber tone is delivered with delectably mocking tone.This is also a forum to delicately show social values without being too heavy-handed. The movie tries to present this serious element and fortunately, it benefits from the mild colorful production to deliver the message in friendly and approachable way. It has the captivating city vista from Big Hero 6, nifty little homage just like Wreck-It Ralph and even better cop drama the last Die Hard movie. The way it balanced everything together is nothing short of amazing.The streets of "Zootopia" offers light amusement, great humor, glossy noir theme and adorably inspirational characters in every scene. In the risk of being utterly corny, Judy and company will hop into your, old or young, heart.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too Many Political/Social Undertones</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Usually I can enjoy a movie while just ignoring all the political and social commentary, but I guess I've been reading too many news articles lately. I just "got" too much of this movie's preaching and it ruined it for me.I hated Wall-E for the same reason. Movies are how I get away from real life. Last thing I need is a dumb cartoon bringing up all the pains and issues of modern society. Anyway, if you like movies that incorporate social commentary, this one does it as well as you could expect. Also, if you've had the wisdom to ignore the current "discussions," you'll probably find the the hidden meanings subtle enough not to be annoying. Unfortunately, if you're like me, and keeping up with all the news and related issues are just making you feel ill, you'll probably find this movie leaves somewhat of a bad taste.In any case, watching this has suddenly made me realized that I need a break from editorials and news articles.

		<shortDescription>Definitely not standard-issue</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, the trailers did make it seem assembly line like. Surprise, surprise: this one's got heart, and brains, to boot...And it does help that its themes are as timely and topical as the ones espoused in the Pixar master-work, 'Wall-E'.Watched this one on(L)I(e)max 3D. Good projection, decent seating, 3D experience worth the surcharge. I think the predominant theme underlying the entire take is the prevalence of prejudices, preconceived notions, and how characters with heart (read, courage) can overcome those and see the truth lying beneath, whether/not they want to see it. Now, though I'm gonna point out my disappointment with the flick, I feel the intent deserves points on its own (which its sure raking up at the box office). Gotta make that reference once again here - this one's almost as ambitious as the masterful 'Wall-E', albeit more in terms of intent rather than content. If only....Now, this movie does many things right, in terms of putting us in the middle of an unfolding tale of an ambitious underdog- type (typical mainstream movie trope, disappointingly so, imho), who, for all intents and purposes, is our window into this alternate universe where humans don't figure (an interesting question actually..are we extinct in 'Zootopia'?). To me, answering that question would have made for a far more interesting movie, but that's a separate topic.Now, most of the entire movie is curiously framed as a buddy cop mystery scenario (another trope used both in mainstream cinema and in Indies, perhaps to better effect in the latter), &amp; that might put a few people off, especially those who've seen this scenario better explored in superior movies ('Kiss kiss bang bang' comes to mind, and 'Lethal Weapon' while it was still fresh - both having Shane Black in common), who've been expecting something different here. The voice-work by named actors is pretty good, and Jason Bateman proves that he pretty much owns anything he's in, even if he's given cheesy lines for an endearing character, but one who's bogged down by utter predictability.But, for me, the lack of anything substantial, and the main plot just taking off a few minutes before it's curtains was the most disappointing thing of all, in addition to, payoffs bring undeserved as well as underserved, along with comeuppances being unearned too (my comparisons? Most Pixar works using the Lasseter name, including the reviled 'Brave'). The McGuffin used, I'd perhaps one of the weakest ever.The movie also goes fully bland mainstream in the selection of its color palette, 3d and musical score choices. To me, that smacked of studio interference at many junctures. Even the mainstream trope thrills don't really pump adrenaline that most Pixar works are known to (Finding Nemo, Incredibles, the aforementioned Wall-E, the inferior Cars and Brave......). To me, the condition and execution of the action set- pieces was borderline bland, as was the villain and the motivation, and the supremely disappointing/underwhelming denouement.Keeping all the negatives listed above in perspective, I find it curious that this one's getting a heavy push from RT etc. though it's not in Pixar league, in spite of some pedigree.And what's Idris Elba doing this year in every Disney flick - this one, 'Jungle Book' and 'Finding Dory'.Also, this one gets a day-date release here, while the (apparently) superior Kung fu Panda 3 might make it's easy here only after a month? Something's not right.Could have been really great. A huge missed opportunity, imho.But - the scene with the Sloths at the DMV, is w0rth the price of admission.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Zootopia is a beautiful beast of a movie. I love it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This March Hare of a movie is a lot of fun. Plenty of Easter Eggs worth checking out! Zootopia has everything that the general audience, might be looking for, in an animation movie. Set in a world where walking, talking, "civilized" animals live in general harmony with one another, regardless of whether they're predator or prey. A small-town rabbit Judy Hopps (voiced by Ginnifer Goodwin) achieves her childhood dream of becoming the first rabbit cop; only to find out, that she been relegates to a safe, but boring parking-duty assignment. However, things started to change, as animals around the city, start to go wild. With a street smart, sly fox Nick Wilde (Jason Bateman), she might be the city's only hope in solving this mystery, once and for all. Directed by Byron Howard and Rich Moore, this movie is so much deeper and mature than previous Disney anthropomorphic animal films, like 1973's Robin Hood &amp; 2005's Chicken Little. It does a great job of teaching audiences important moral lessons about tolerance, and respecting, those who might be different to you. I love how egalitarian ideals are challenged by Zootopia's stereotypical political prejudices here. Its shows how animalistic, human are being, toward each other. It's really needed, social commentary. I love the use of animals as the message without being heavy-handed or preachy. While, the movie is able to do that well, the movie does have a large number of unanswered questions that kinda bug me about its exposition delivering. I know that these animals has indeed evolve; but wouldn't the so-called animal look a little different than its normal counterparts? After all, in this world, "Survival of the fittest" &amp; "Natural selection' doesn't really existed in this world, as much as it does in our world. Here is a good example: most of the movie plays off, the fact that predators are turning back, toward their former selves. However, wouldn't these creatures, couldn't have those normal animalistic behaviors like their previous selves, because the fact, that they evolve from creatures that hasn't eaten meat, or hunt in many of years. I get that, maybe, they're just feel the force to kill, because of drugs, but I can't find myself, believing, that they want to eat their prey, when they haven't done, so, in many of years. Also, how in the hell, are they still considered 'predators' if they don't eat the prey? The only idea, I got is that, they allow to eat, lots of many lower forms of life like other vertebrates and invertebrates creatures. However, this change in diet, doesn't allow them, to keep their normal animalistic features? If they became all vegans; wouldn't these 'predators', honestly look more like normal herbivores? Even the herbivores would look and act different, since they evolve into creatures that lost some normal features, due to no longer, needed to be used. Also, what standards of animal evolution, makes these animal choose, which creature can or cannot be eaten. Is mammals, the only ones sapient in this world? I find that odd, because some invertebrate and vertebrate creatures like reptiles, arachnids, amphibians, crustaceans, birds, jellyfishes and fishes do have some intelligent right to not be eaten. Who is considered as sapient, who is not? Maybe, I'm thinking, too much on it, since this is after all, a cartoon, but it's a good question for a debate. Still, the movie is relentlessly entertaining enough to overlook those logically questions. It's a well-rounded film. The computer animation from Disney animation studios looks amazing and beautiful. I love the look of the futuristic look of the city and how it's operates. The action scenes in this film were intense and full of danger. The neo-noir murder-mystery is suspenseful, dark and thrilling. The jokes were mostly clever and funny. Love the mixer of adult humor with that of childish ones. Love all the references and homages. Glad to even see, some non-Disney ones, like 1972's Godfather &amp; AMC's Breaking Bad TV Show. The family, friendship and relationship dramatic is heart-warming and well development. Voice actors, Ginnifer Goodwin and Jason Bateman are spot on, with their characters. I love the constantly energetic, optimistic Judy working the sly, con man attitude of Nick. It made for very good chemistry. The supporting cast is just as amazing. Also, mad props go to composter, Michael Giacchino &amp; singer, Shakira for the catchy 'Try Everything' theme song of this film. The music and soundtrack is stunning to listen to. Overall: This animated adventure is equal parts buddy-cop comedy, fish-out-of-water tale, and whodunit mystery is a great movie. With its vibrant visuals, simple but evocative storyline, and important social commentary, Zootopia is a talking-animal pic worth watching with the whole family. A must-watch for everybody.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Safe, slightly heartwarming, and pretty funny. Closer to Shrek and Madagascar than it is to any Disney classics.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is really disappointing to me. I've seen some of Disney's best, and this isn't it -- but it easily could have been. When I saw Zootopia's teaser trailer months ago before "Inside Out", it looked like a solid premise: "animals live like people but retain some of their wild traits". It doesn't take an amazing premise to make an amazing movie. "Frozen" and "The Lion King" are awesome movies not because of the setup for their story, but because of how the story is told. They feel like care was put into their world.Zootopia takes a lazier, more adult approach to creativity. You can see this same problem in "The Lego Movie", most kids' movies, and many episodes of "Family Guy". The laziest humor you can have is referential humor, and Zootopia's references cheapen the clever jokes it also has. Given this animal world, there's room for a lot of funny jokes and puns based on traits audiences are familiar with. One that Disney gets a lot of mileage out of is how many offspring rabbits tend to create (the main character has around 180 siblings). And those jokes are really funny because they only make sense in the world of Zootopia.It's a lot lazier to make an iPhone, make it look like an iPhone, and change the Apple logo to a carrot logo. On another phone, we see a photos app whose interface and logo look a lot like Google Photos. In "Toy Story 3", there's a ripoff of a Macbook, and it *enhances* the story - these are real toys in the real human world, interacting with a real brand of computers. What is so exciting about Zootopia is it gives its writers and animators a chance to make its own unique world. Any relationship with the human world should serve a logical purpose within the animal world as well. Otherwise, it's like the animal world of Zootopia doesn't even exist. (This is done well, for example, when a train car has three sets of doors, for big, medium, and small animal). "Wreck-It Ralph" puts more care into its world than Zootopia does.There's an extended reference to "The Godfather" which has lots of references and not much original humor. It's disappointing to have boring references like this alongside creative, funny jokes that build off of Zootopia's world. I laughed a lot at the lame costumes at a school play in the film.Perhaps the most tasteless joke in the entire movie is that lemmings follow each other. They don't, and they never have. This myth was created BY Disney in the 1950s. Not only is it weird to have fake animal behaviors in a movie seemingly obsessed with cataloging real ones, it's insulting to be reminded of Disney's past animal abuse. There are animals that move in herds, and a joke that bison or sheep all scrambled in a herd to buy a "pawpsicle" is not much of a stretch from the existing joke.Like its comedy, the rest of Zootopia is uneven. Jason Bateman puts in a great performance as a mischievous fox. He channels the conniving behavior his "Arrested Development" character had in that show's final season. The animation is rarely jawdropping. Dreamworks or Sony could have animated this movie, and very little would be different. Even the fur of the animals doesn't look that fluffy or fun, except in rare scenes. I was more blown away by "Frozen", and that was over two years ago. "Frozen" had incredible bright lighting, shimmering water reflections, and sparkly snow and ice. In Zootopia, there's a good montage of all the climates its city has to offer. Also, there is an "Avatar"-style serene misty floaty jungle type of place, but other than that, it's a pretty normal city with a fairly normal visual style.The story kept me interested in the movie but is not one I want to go back to. A rabbit cop is tasked with solving the disappearance of an otter. There's some interesting, yet obvious subtext that is expressed reasonably well. It's relevant in the era of Donald Trump, but says little that hasn't been said in countless other movies. When movies like "Frozen" or "The Little Mermaid" have an average story, they can fall back on their incredible visuals and thrilling music. Zootopia has no traditional musical numbers, and the vocal song that plays through the rabbit's phone early in the film isn't nearly as catchy as "Under the Sea", nor is it as rich with meaning as "Let It Go". I like its message, saying that trying new things and making mistakes is an important part of life, but didn't find it as engaging as some pop hits like "Raise Your Glass". The instrumental soundtrack (from the composer for "Inside Out" and "The Incredibles") was more up my alley. I specifically noticed how cool "Ticket to Write" was - it has a laid-back, tropical vibe.Good animal stories can be told. Disney made The Lion King. Other companies made "Cats Don't Dance", "Fantastic Mr. Fox", and "Finding Nemo". The TV show "Polar Bear's Cafe" has inventive animal comedy. What saddens me with Zootopia is that you get bits of cynicism, that the filmmakers are so above it all. "We didn't make our own Google logo because we didn't have to". "We copied human sensibilities for pop stars because that's what people recognize". The implication is that kids are too stupid to know the difference between attention to detail and sloppiness, and the cynicism and references to real life are there to keep parents from wanting to leave the theater. As if a well-made movie with an easy-to-follow story is something that no adult would want to watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went yesterday to see this movie with my sister, and we laughed when we saw that the entire cinema was full of children and parents. But I have to say that we were the ones who enjoyed it the most! Great movie, excellent graphics and a very entertaining story. I loved how this movie has been made; they have taken care of even the smallest details. The city of Zootopia is absolutely beautiful. It is funny to see how the houses and roads are shown. A very original and fresh plot. The characters are very well developed. Their emotions are very realistic, and you can relate to them. The dialogue is very well made and you laugh loudly at times.Great movie!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was a painful watch. Maybe it is aimed at girls? But I just couldn't relate to the constantly happy happy joy joy galling cute annoying rabbit &amp; the insipid fox. The other characters are only there when the jokes demand their involvement. Everything is so dull. So predictable. The story is a mess, the script is moronic, the performances are typical, the shots are trapped within what non-animated films would do, the music is throwaway pop, &amp; the concept is a lazy attempt at racism. Even though all the characters are played by mostly white Caucasians.This has nothing special going for it. It's "cute". That's the hook. It will appeal to the brainwashed lowest common denominator. It won't resonate years to come like Ratatouille, Finding Nemo, WallE, or Wreck-it Ralph.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Cute" movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Allow me to preface this by saying I work in the film industry. As someone who works in production, I've seen a lot of movies. And by a lot, I mean A LOT, so what I'm about to tell you may not be your experience, and you should by no means decide on seeing a movie based on one guy's opinion.With that being said- I've been a Disney fan all of my life. I grew up with the classic animated musicals, I found Nemo Incredible and Wreck-It Ralph Frozen(not really, but titles are fun), so naturally I thought Zootopia was going to be a surefire hit. And it was. Kind of. It had all of the elements- the odd couple duo, the social themes and let's not forget the breathtaking animation(and by God, it was beautiful). However, there was something missing. It seemed that Disney phoned it in this time, I could see every plot point coming a mile away. It was predictable, rushed(typically Disney leaves little jokes hidden in the background, and despite the clever layout of the city, that was lacking. Michael Giacchino's score couldn't even save it.Perhaps my standards were too high. If you expect perfection, a B+ feels like an F. So go see it if you want to, don't if you don't, I don't care. Just consider yourself warned.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tangled, Wreck it Ralph and now Zootopia. It looks like Disney Animation is quickly becoming a pool of great movies. I came out of this one with a smile that covered my whole face and I still find hard to shake it off, this movie blew me away in excitement, fun but most of all heart.One cannot start to talk about Zootopia without mentioning some of the best world building of recent years. other than being animated to perfection, this film is alive, it is engaging even in its background and other than being intelligently thought out, it tells a story only with its world. Be it comedy or social commentary, I just wished multiple times I could put it pause the film or instantly rewatch a scene to absorb everything that was going on. This is a further example of the truly excellent, intelligent visual storytelling animated films are excelling at, especially recently and I remember clearly having a moment in the film in which I was effortlessly happy for cinema and its future, because this was the living proof of correctly using new mediums and technologies to tell a story.And I haven't even started yet talking about the characters of Zootopia. As I was watching the film I thought to myself that these were going to become staples of the genre, that's how good they are. The chemistry between the two main characters is unbelievable and their arch is riveting to watch at every moment, with a fantastic pay off. This film is so well written: be it the running gags, the pop culture references which never end and never miss, the character development, the storytelling, the themes incorporated seamlessly, the emotional connection, the perfect handling of secondary characters, the hilarious, laugh out loud comedic moments, I hope I am not missing anything, all of these were part of screenplay that I am sure I will revisit and study joyfully. I can't believe how much I fell in love with this world and its characters and only now I realized how entertained I was with them, not to mention how absorbing the story proved to be.The film does have its false steps, but none of them really mattered to me. The introduction is somewhat off beat and uneven with the rest, there are a little too many coincidences and whilst the characters are thankfully in danger many times, they are as many times handed a solution to problems which makes things a little too easy for them at times, yet fortunately the film does integrate these very organically to the point were you roll along, without even thinking about it.I wished this film would not end, that's how much fun I was having with it, this is a very recommended watch in the theater, where possibly adults are going to have more fun than kids. Can't wait to check this out again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An anti-Trump, anti-Cruz, anti-Rubio, anti-fear mongering movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first half of this movie is pretty much Disney-by-the-numbers. The little bunny who dreams of being a police officer fights prejudice triggered by her diminutive size and timid race. (The other police officers are all large, ferocious animals like lions and tigers and bears and even rhinoceroses.) Her parents try to convince her to stick with what they and their family have always done, but she refuses to buy into their complacency. Others make fun of her because she's a rabbit. Etc.The scene at the DMV where it turns out that the clerks are all sloths had the adults in the audience, including myself, laughing out loud, though the little children had no idea why their parents were laughing.But then, when we finally start to understand what is behind the disappearance of the 12 predators - is it 12 by chance, I wonder? - that there has been an attempt to seize political power in the city by ramping up one group's fear of another group based on supposed racial character traits, this movie moves from the pleasant world of Disney animation to the current political scene. There is no attempt to make any group of animals look like Muslims, or Mexicans, or ..., nor any of the fear-mongers look like Trump or Cruz or ..., but you'd have to be a 6 year old not to see what the movie is trying to say. Suddenly it is speaking to the parents who dutifully brought their kids to yet another Disney animated movie, not to sell them merchandise but to wake them up to the current political scene.Do the parents see that the movie is now talking to them, about now? I don't know. But when the Fox, to prove his point, suddenly pretends to attack Judy Rabbit and Judy goes for her fox repellent even though the Fox has become her good friend - or has he? - you are forced to come to terms with the fact that, even behind most of our pc verbiage a socially-instilled fear of others who are different is still in us, and can be exploited by those who want to use us to gain power for themselves.I have no idea what the little children in the audience today came away with. To judge from their restlessness as the movie went on and became more serious, perhaps not a lot.But the parents who were able to keep watching in between trying to keep their little ones still might, at least for a moment, have gotten a rather remarkable reflection on the current presidential race.Going back to such early feature-length movies as *Bambi*, the Disney Studios have often found some of their best material in the things that really frighten us. Not cheap horror fear, but deep-down fears that reside inside us. Bambi's mother warned her young child to beware the hunters because they were a real source of danger, and that masterpiece made them terrifying though it never showed them to us - or perhaps because it never showed them to us. This Disney picture warns us, too, about another sort of danger. The fear is of a different kind, but no less menacing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Disney movie so far!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just came home from seeing Zootopia, and guess what? It's great. In my opinion, it's better than Big Hero 6. Zootopia mixes up a laugh-out-loud comedy with a detective story with some serious scenes, and the result is just fine. There are times where I got distracted by a scene, in particular, where past Disney movies were spoofed as a pirated Blu-Ray, or another one, the sloth scene we saw in the trailer. It's a detective story about searching a missing otter and why he went savage en route plus who is behind this. Please take note that there are some scenes that are not that kid-friendly (i.e, turning animals into savage by guns, fooling somebody just for the money, a panther with a scratched eye, a fox scratches a young Judy Hopps and her wound is seen, discouraging someone that she can't be what she dreams to be, parents laughing at Judy Hopps for being a parking guard and not a real cop, a naturalist resort with nude animals, etc.) which explains why it is rated PG-13 locally (in my country).The voice acting was well-done! Jason Bateman and Giniffer Goodwin fit in their roles. While I had really high hopes for Michael Giacchino's score, I thought it was just okay, but that wouldn't undo my high rating. The puns and spoofs are what make this movie really hilarious (Carrot/Apple, Rangled, Pig Hero 6, Meowna based on Disney's upcoming flick 'Moana', Wreck-It Rhino, Targoat, etc.). Zootopia is not your usual comedy film. It actually has a story that is really entertaining, memorable dialogue and comedic scenes, well-developed characters with realistic emotions, a well-done design for the city Zootopia, and a strong message for both kids and adults alike about prejudice that is explained clearly. This is the best Disney movie (still not better than Pixar's films, but it is in their level) so far!10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An excellent film overall. Disney! you have done it again. The interplay between Judy (Hops) the rabbit and Nick the fox was simply a joy to watch, on how they outwitted each other. Next, the comedic elements had 80% of my cinema goers laughing, especially with the sloth, who steals the show! Finally, the values taught are very real in our society, that of discrimination, resilience and going the extra mile. This is what sets animation apart from other more adult films. Overall, I give this an 8/10! excellent, excellent film! On another note, I do have a youtube review of this if you search '3 reasons to watch zootopia' by the Mrfoo.

We saw the trailer and had high hopes for it, and boy did it deliver.The characters are well thought through and the visuals are beautiful. The whole idea behind this movie is great. It doesn't involve any human characters, just animals that all walk on two feet and live their lives like humans would. Disney has created a whole new world where everyone has a job and does its daily activities.Of course there's a deeper moral to the story like any other Disney movie. To see how it all works out, I'd say just check it out, you'll like it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a very cringey movie where animals pretend to be human but have moronic animal names so people know they're animals, there's also stupid unfunny animal jokes that make no sense and is made for creepy basement dwelling weirdos who want to have sex with animals and for children who will later become furries. Even the places have stupid sounding names some sound like they were ripped off too. The giraffe pop star and her back up dancers was the furry bait for this movie but most of the people who watch this movie make Fox/Bunny porn. The plot is not anything special either with an ending so original and predictable only an imbecile or a furry would like it. And it's not like you care for any of these characters or want to see them succeed if anything you would prefer them to fail and die. Some animals want to become feral and eat each other but some animals don't and the blah blah blah, bland pop culture references, and the villain was someone they trusted and he betrays them but they outsmart him and save the day... whatvever... Frag this stupid movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Zootopia is about ambitious bunny Judy Hopps, a rookie cop assigned an impossible case, and a fox street hustler named Nick Wild. The two form an unlikely friendship working the case together. More and more animals have gone missing in Zootropolis and it is up Judy and her unlikely partner, Nick the fox, to track them down in 48 hours.This movie has something for folks of all ages, obviously it appeals to kids, but it is also stock full of sly hints and references just for the grown ups(although there is a particularly clever Frozen reference in there that the kids might get). It is just gorgeous animation and the attention to detail is astonishing (like in the corner of Judys phone the carrier is "PB&amp;J"). Overall it is a fine movie, you can bring the kids to it (or they can bring you to it) but you will most certainly still get a lot out of it anyway. And the song really catchy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Disneyfied, thrilling neo-noir</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Walt Disney studios has been anthropomorphizing animals since before any of us were born, and it goes to show that they picked up a couple of tricks along the way. What an amazing world they have created for this movie, with tons of great details both in the forefront and in the background. Some jokes were obvious, while some I'm sure go over the head of the mostly young audience that will see this movie. The different parts of the city, how the animals live together despite physical differences, all of it is a delight to watch. And it's rendered beautifully.There are some parts of this movie that I'm not that big a fan of. The visual style of this movie is nice, but it's also very similar to what we have seen before. In Frozen, Tangled and this, we see Disney turning the style used in their traditional animation movies being converted into these computer generated styles. Maybe it is because other studios has also taken inspiration from Disney's old movies, but the animals in this movie mostly look very similar to what we have seen before in Dreamworks movies, for instance. While it was all still beautiful, the characters all felt like (really nice) "stock CGI-models".The ending was a bit of a let down too. It's as "noir" as the rest of the movie, but underwhelming. Most likely because they did not want to go "darker", as this is a Disney-movie. Obviously we can't expect it to go as far as "Who Framed Roger Rabbit?", but a bit more would have helped.All in all, it's a really fun movie that everyone can enjoy. I saw this in a "surpise screening" at the local art cinema (with a room full of cinephiles), and everyone seemed to enjoy it a lot. Despite there not being a single child in attendance. People were laughing and crying, jumping in their seats and going "aww". Disney knows their stuff.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A steady delivery from Disney yet again</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've always admired the Disney films, from the very first of Snow white and the seven dwarfs to their latest instalment of Zootopia. It has a red thread, a theme and vibrant humour throughout the entire film, and it keeps on those values from start to finish.Judy Hopps is a bunny with dreams, big dreams, as she's a bunny with the dreams of becoming an officer, which no bunny has ever been. Despite everyone's attempts of keeping her from it, she goes through it. As an officer, she's looked down at, until she lands her first case, and inadvertently her first "partner" in the sly fox Nick Wilde. And together the unlikely partners (despite the fox' will) starts pulling the strings together of the mysterious case of the missing animals of Zootopia.The story isn't sophisticated, but then again, no story from Disney is. This isn't "The usual suspects" or "Lucky number slevin", but it is a good story and there are some strong themes around prejudice and reaching for your dreams, regardless of what others say. The animations are superb as always, the music lively and the soundscape amazing. The details are good as well, from the long delivery tube to get the coffee delivered to the giraffe to the entire city block dedicated to rodents, there are details all over the place. The creators went to great lengths to make sure Zootopia as a diverse city, stood out as one. I can highly recommend this film to kids and adults alike. If you're a fan of Disney films - like me - then this film isn't a disappointment, and delivers that Disney magic that we've all come to love from over 70 years of their works.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fantastic Disney Movie, and my all time favorite animated movie ever!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So, i just saw Zootopia, i was waiting for the movie for three and a half weeks, last year i did not think to much of it until i saw just one, new trailer and i loved it from then. The movie is about a Bunny Cop that has to prove that smaller animals can do anything like a bigger one can . In Zootopia both predators and non predators live together in harmony. And Zootopia is not the only place, there is a hole world with different regions, landscape, each individual animal lives in its respective area as in our world, and some mixed. But the art and animation is great! The level of detail is stunning and is probably the best looking animated movie ever made, well it is Disney so it is expected. But The main character Judy hopps and Nick Wilde, are both great character and they have perfect chemistry between them, even tho they are animals they feel so real and this world is so real, it is almost as you can envision yourself living there, i mean Judys phone is basically an Iphone, no mistake. But the story is that she needs to solve a case and she has only 48 hours to do so, why 48 and why she has to do it i will not spoil since it is such a big part of the movie,I'm writing this very tired so it is not the best review, and sorry for spelling I'm Swedish, but yhea, great animation, great characters great art, great story, great everything, great drama and there are some really good dramatic scenes, the animation enhance the emotions we see threw the characters so that is a big plus, and for me, this movie is more of a family and not just for kids, heck i would not even rate this pg7, if there existed 10 i would put it at that, this movies is very mature and adults and teenagers will appreciate that. I myself am 17 years old, and went with my sister who is 19, and in the theather there were kids, adults and teenagers, id still only take kids around 9 to 10 and above, since it is a crime drama i don't think younger kids will find it interesting or will understand what is going on. It also have a plentiful of funny scenes that will make most people laugh, and what happened after the credits, people where clapping, that has never happened to me ever before with a movie, so yhea, Go see it, it is just fantastic and I'm probably going to see it again this week! It is my favorite animated Disney movie ever, when i say animated i mean 3d, you know frozen, wreck it Ralph etc. SEE IT! EDIT: Seen it three times now.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There was not even one funny content, sloppy dialogs, and the story totally flat. I doubt it was a comedy. I wouldn't suggest it for children, as the plot is hardly understandable even adults. By understandable I mean exciting. This movie just happened. No memories left. No magic left. It's hard to write anything cause the movie was empty. Disappointing. I love Lion the King, Tangled, WALL-E, Hercules, but this movie is a disgrace! It is full of humor for adults, crappy humor by the way. Children sitting behind me asked their father: "Can we go home, please", and it was just 30 minutes of movie. They started asking repeatedly after one hour. I totally agreed with them. I wanted to go home and watch Lion the King. I wanted my evening back. Nice marketing Disney! Sadly. You won't catch me again. Is it the end of animation for children and people with young hearts?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There is a few times were a movie comes out and i can give it a 10/10 (favourite) rating without having to watch it a second time. But this picture was far too great for me not to score 10/10.Zootopia follows our bunny protagonist Juddy Hopps in her quest for justice, honesty and most of all achieving her dream of becoming a cop, impossible as it may seem due to her size, against all odds and constant warnings from others. As a cop she will meet Nick Wilde, a sly fox con artist that will help her uncover some conspiracy that could potentially ruin relationships between prey and predators.This movie is as smart as a anthropomorphic animal film can be taking advantage of every quality of the animal kingdom (for example the districts of the city Zootopia are ecosystems) while also making some references to pop culture and clever writing. The voice acting is top notch and the animation is by far one of the best out there, with impressive lighting effects and character facial expressions. But the best element of this film is its two main characters and the chemistry between them...yes there is just as much chemistry between Juddy and Nick as there is between Danny Golver and Mel Gibson in Lethal Weapon.I fell in love with this movie and i cant wait to see it again. If you are into animation definitely give this a try, it has plenty of adult humor and kids will find the animated characters just riveting. To name some possible flaws the movie might fall into some clichés throughout and is predictable, but the writing, characters and animation is so good i don't think it matters that much. Also the 3d is fine but not really necessary.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fantastic!!! And simply adorable.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off let me start by simply saying this was by far the best movie I've seen in years hands down! Sorry Star Wars, but my heart rests with this film!So what's to say? Well for starters the detail is simply amazing! There were honestly so many things going on I simply wasn't able to catch every single thing and trust me there is a lot! The scenery and characters are just so organic and the attention to even the most smallest of detail was incredible!As for the characters (I'll try to keep this spoiler free from here on out but I will add one little thing right at the end. Warning will be given beforehand!) So... The characters are all done perfectly, even the villains are hard not to like! Both main characters were very relatable and each face something special to the story. I found myself at times loving Judies kindhearted optimistic nature although I'm a bit more like Nick with his more worldly look on life and the small we get to see of his back story is both sad and tragic and is something that still haunts him as an adult. Nick is funny, very funny! And a bit sarcastic at times and although he's not the overly emotional/affectionate type but he does have a heart and he does show it in his own way when the time comes! From what I know of Ginnifer Goodwin and Jason Bateman the personalities of Judy and Nick fit the real life counterparts perfectly!Story wise Zootopia is first and foremost a story of being true to ones self! But also just importantly it's a story of over coming perceived prejudice. Zootopia does a very good job and displaying what could be easily understood as bigoted attitudes concerning race, gender, or even sexuality without ever being preachy about it. It also shows rather bluntly that not all stereotypes are completely untrue! The film does have a message however, a very positive one! It's simply be good to one another. We're all in this together.I've seen a whole lot of people bring this up and even more art of it so this might upset a few! Judy and Nick are not a romantic couple! They are and do however become very close friends that do love and care a lot about one another! I find that sometimes a close friendship like this is every bit if not even more important as being in a relationship.All in all Zootopia is a must see! Young or old! You'll laugh (a lot) and might even tear up just a bit. But by the end I'm certain you'll have a huge smile on your face! When this comes out state side in about two weeks from the date of this journal post GO SEE THIS MOVIE!!! Trust me as someone who doesn't go out very often this was worth every penny of what I paid! You'll not be disappointed. This is no Chicken Little folks!My only negative point is I wish they would of given Nick more story. I was left with many questions that were left unanswered like why he was homeless. Also it should of been noted that Nick is also a vegetarian, it hinted to this but never really said such.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Zootopia stars Ginnifer Goodwin, and Jason Bateman, and its about a bunny that is trying to be a real cop, and in that process she meets a fox and they have to team up for kind of a investigation that is going on. I have liked wreck it Ralph and Big Hero 6 in the past, not really that much for Frozen. I liked a lot of things on this movie, but it is a very normal film for children. When we first ever look at Zootopia, it looks great. There is clearly a lot of creativity behind it, but there is not enough of that creativity here. The two main actors did fine on their job, but i think they would be played by other actors. The plot is sometimes riveting, but you know what is going to happen at the end. I will say that I laughed a lot in a scene involving sloths that i will not spoil you have to see it yourself. But other than that, I really did not laugh that much in the movie, some of the jokes really fall flat. Also there is a cliché of where friends get mad at each other, and there is lot of moping and doping. It is just time consuming as you know they are going to get back together, so there is no point to it. Overall, i think kids would have a good time with this movie, and it is a good movie, but i think Disney can make better entertainment for both adults and children. 7.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Surprisingly Mature Animation by Disney</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After the success of Frozen and Big Heroes 6, Disney continues to improve by upgrading its animation quality not only in terms of story and effects, but surprisingly on originality, delivering messages and a sense of maturity. Setting up in a city occupied by all types of animals, it manipulates the relationship of predators and preys as a metaphor to emphasis the current society's biases phenomenon rather than the usual family relationship issues audiences usually seen in previous animated films. Being a funny and adventurous simple tale, the structural progression of the story is not the usual straightforward style that is kid friendly but mostly due to its thrilling elements that lead to twisted plots which is quite rare in animations. Scores composed by Michael Giacchino and theme song "Try Everything" by Shakira perfectly fit while the ingenious landscapes of metropolitan city and mother nature definitely serve as splendid visual treats. It is undeniable smart and classic, strong like a bull to stress on the existence of prejudice and peace, only if we learn to respect each others from different races, backgrounds and cultures.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Your Usual Disney Anthropomorphic Animal Story. "Zootopia" is a Clever Buddy Cop Story.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Out of "Zootopia" comes one of Disney's cleverest scripts, for the fact it successfully pulls off a new spin on their usual fables. Well, the concept isn't new ? an animal buddy cop movie, but in usual Disney animated magic, it is a fun new creation. At the center of this buddy cop movie is bunny Judy Hopps (a wonderful Ginnifer Goodwin), an aspiring cadet who is landed on parking duty, despite being a valedictorian in police academy. But when given a chance to solve a case, she recruits fox con artist Nick Wilde (a smooth-talking Jason Bateman in perfect voice acting mode) to crack it. Yes, one can see the obvious direction this goes. But surprisingly, "Zootopia" greatly pulls off the clichés with an abundant dose of Disney Animation Studio's colorful animation (from the creative Zootopia districts to its 3D effects) and its surprising script that, to be honest, contained one of Disney's more adult-oriented dialogue. Secretly, every line and frame is littered with self-referential humor that mostly adults will relate to. (That explains my country's PG-13 rating.) Aside from mature humor, its surprising detour to teach about prejudice is a timely subject. And thankfully, it was not handled with a smack in the gut. All around, "Zootopia" may not stick out as a classic, but can rest in our subconscious as one fun, wild ride. So, sticking out for more fun adventures with Judy Hopps and Nick Wilde!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I love this movie so much</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I disagree with Sean Phillips and Tako Yaki. This is a great movie. I couldn't just watch it once. I don't want to spoil it for anyone who hasn't seen it but I would definitely recommend it to both young and older audiences. I noticed while watching it that Apple is advertised in it as well, so that it can feel more contemporary with the present as Disney done in quite a few films, including Oliver and Company. The animation is smoothly done and beautiful, and the story itself gives a really positive message to children of all ages. This is the best movie I've seen in a long time, and I have recommended it to almost everyone I've talked to. It's heartwarming. Even though the movie is almost two hours long, it goes by very smoothly, and the story itself is new, not retold as some are. Of course the characters do have their very own characteristics and such, and the concept of life with just animals is interesting as well. It reflects bullying, being told what you can and can't do, motivation, encouragement, racism, and bullying, and is relatable. I love this movie!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Zootopia (2016) - Best Disney Movie I've seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Welcome to the anthropomorphic world of Zootopia! Created by Rich Moore and Byron Howard and their amazing cast and crew, this movie is clearly one of the best movies Disney has ever made, colorful and joyful for all ages and good for having a good laugh. Prepare to watch a bunny named Judy Hopps team up with her natural enemy, the fox (Nick Wilde) in an adventure to solve a missing mammal case. This movie will keep you entertained from beginning to end with amazingly beautiful animation and a creative plot! This movie promises to be one of the best ever of Disney's Animation Studios.This is the best Disney movie I've seen!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is the most exiting movie!!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am simply dying for this movie. It is coming out in march 4. I saw lots of sneak peeks though. I went to Disney animation studios and got previews. It is so sad when Judy and Nick argue and Judy apologizes. 108 minutes is a long time. In Nick backstory, his mother could not afford his boy scout outfit. He was harshly bullied by the prey animals. I will not spoil the ending.Judy's play was hilarious. She pretended she was dead and overplayed it. Her parents were not enthusiastic but the others were. Gideon Grey was so nice in the climax. Note: Watch this movie!!!!!!!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Worst Films Disney Made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First thing's first: Yes I know a lot of Furries were excited for this film, claiming they FINALLY got a film dedicated to furries! Except, their are PLENTY of other furry films out there, like Rock N Rule, Fritz The Cat, and Meet The Feebles to name a few. But I guess cause it's Disney it gets a free-pass? Anyway, onto the review: This is one,if not THE, worst films of 2016 and probably one of Disney's worst. It's main issue is that we seen this type of story done before and done better in countless of other movies (But as always, whenever Disney does it, they get a free pass). It's basic premise is that Judy Hops is the first rabbit to join the Police force but must join forces with a well-known con named Nick, a fox (haha I get it cause Foxes are known to be sneaky...wasn't that used before?) to uncover a sinister plot involving certain citizens of Zootopia reverting back to their predatory status and *SPOILERS* they find out that it was all the work of Deputy Mayor Bellwether. To put it in simpler terms: This is a movie about both Racism and SJWs. The characters are boring to the point of being predictable. Heck, most of the characters advertised are only there for only a joke or as a background character. As for the villain behind the plot, they're a SJW character and they want the world to fear predators like they used to...ANOTHER element we seen before. As for the animation, it's Disney, you'd expect great animation from them and here it's once again great. But that is the only positive I'll give it. The little attention to details are amazing at times and the way each animal is animated is clever and unique, Now, one scene in particular made me go and ask "WHY did Disney put this in the film?!" and it's one of the heavily advertised scenes. Said scene being the music scene with Shakira's character. Why do I have a problem with this scene? Well, the way the tiger characters are dressed and the way they are dancing, it is pretty much male strippers dancing. Disney...this is a film for FAMILIES so WHY did you put male strippers in the film?! You know, I wanted to like this film cause I thought Disney was doing something unique and different, but I can not bring myself to neither liking this film nor recommending it to anyone. If you want a furry film done right AND is creative and unique, watch either Fritz The Cat, Rock N Rule, or Meet The Feebles, If you want a MUST- SEE film in theaters, go and see Deadpool for a 20th time or save your cash for Ice Age: Collision Course, Warcraft, or any of the other films coming out this year. Even if you take the furry element out of this movie, this is still one of the worst films I've seen. Sorry, Disney, but this is the worst film of 2016 and one of your worst films in a while.And just a quick edit: Really Disney?! A Breaking Bad reference? IN A FAMILY FILM!? WHAT CHILD WATCHES BREAKING BAD?!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The greatest movie actual of Disney could have done</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The actual Disney films didn't save The company to me. Frozen despite being a blockbuster, I did not like. Big Hero 6 unsaved much. Zootopia definitely safe. This is The frist time i actually like for complete. They don't have The story of The Parents are dead, they don't have a Script cliché, They don't have ALL The Movie song in every minute, its Just a great film. The idea of a City of Animals sounds silly But what they do of this they have very clear ideas. The characters are fantastic, The Animation is fantastic, The Script is fantastic. Is weird but is The frist time i See a great Disney film and Not a cliché Disney film. I wasn't expecting i Was going to like this film. Zootopia is a very Good film who they have a Good entrentening for Adults and Kids.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Embarrassing Example of What a Movie Should Not be</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Disney does not make movies for children anymore. They make movies for adults now with some of the most repulsive undertones in them (such as into the woods, for example). This movie is embarrassing and unnecessarily crude. Disney is starting to make animated films that are not appropriate for children. The whole "nudist" thing was disgusting. For your information Disney I have the right to judge whoever I want, and that includes people who think it is okay to run around naked. I will not be taking my children to this insulting adult film. It's amazing how far Disney has fallen. The cartoon Robin Hood from 1973 was a story about furies and it was perfectly decent, but this film is just awful. Sure the animation is great, some of the characters are cute and humorous, but as far as the story goes it is rehashed from several things, including the Godfather. I'm tired of Disney making their animated films for adults and not children. This movie, along with The Good Dinosaur, are just the animation flops this year. I can't understand why Disney has such trouble making good animated films (Inside Out was good but the other Disney animations this year were terrible). Stop trying to be a world politician Disney, by forcing your opinions on everyone else and attempting to brainwash children by placing these opinions in movies that are supposed to be for children. I can only hope that the live-action Jungle Book and Finding Dory and Moana will be better, but I seriously doubt they will.If you like furies then you might have fun with this film, but seriously I thought the movie was overly crude.</fullReview>
