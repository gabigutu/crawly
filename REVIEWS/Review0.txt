		<shortDescription>What Atmospheric Gothic-horror Should Be.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alfred Hitchcock was and is still the undisputed Master of Suspense, and there is a lot of that here in his foray into Gothic horror, as the mystery surrounding the unseen yet omnipresent Rebecca will engage the viewer from its dreamy start to its bleak conclusion. This is exactly what atmospheric is supposed to be about, and in black and white, it shines. This is also what Gothic horror is in essence, and many have imitated yet come up short, most notably M. Night Shyamalan who, in trying to go for a shock twist and purported "atmosphere" only creates a bad aftertaste and a hangover the size of Mount Everest. This is, essentially, Hitchcock's first true masterpiece.Not one performance rings false, not to the novel or to their respective interpretations. Lawrence Olivier, quite possibly one of the greatest actors that ever lived, portrays a broken man who still lives haunted by the past as he himself were still living in that unending hell. Judith Anderson embodies one of the most coldly sadistic figures in cinema history, her smooth and elegant truculence only exceeded by Anthony Hopkins' rendition of Dr. Hannibal Lecter. One can't seem to understand the way she wallows in her dead mistresses' clearly perverse nature, but that exactly she does, right down to her own end. George Sanders does what he does best: sneer, smirk, and spit line after line of practiced venom, and would be honored 10 years later in ALL ABOUT EVE. Gladys Cooper, still striking in her 50s, plays into her casual cattiness which means no harm, although her rendition of Beatrice Lacy is a little subdued from the novel's version.And then there is Joan Fontaine. Not one of the best actresses on film, yet here, playing a role that evolves beautifully from a frightened, weak girl who is put into a situation she does not understand and who turns right at the point of losing it into a much more mature, strong woman capable of holding her own, she carries the weight of the entire drama and comes forth with flying colors. While I would have preferred Anne Baxter who would have been the exact right age for this role, Fontaine exudes so much restraint and nervousness about her character (partially to blame Olivier's treatment of her and Hitchcock's telling her the entire cast hated her), it's almost a relief when she finally decides to confront Olivier about what it the secret of Manderley. Not many roles require such a change and not many actresses would sink her teeth into a part that requires being put-upon until she can't stand no more, and this is one beautiful performance.A movie that should have won more Oscars that year, REBECCA has since grown in stature and proved that a film need not trophies to be Timeless and Great.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If you want to be totally enthralled for two hours just watch 'Rebecca'!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hitchcock felt 'Rebecca', his first Hollywood film, was a compromise, but as a viewer I just can't fault it. It's a masterpiece in my opinion, full of suspense, mystery and brooding atmosphere. It's also one of the most romantic movies I've ever seen. I've watched it several times over the years, and even now that I know all the plot twists and turns (quite shocking on your first viewing), it never fails to hook me in. One of the reasons it really works is the flawless casting. I'm not much of an Olivier fan but he's superb as de Winter, with just the right mixture of charm and coldness. And Joan Fontaine is just perfect as de Winter's new bride. I can't spot an unconvincing moment in her performance and can't imagine any other actress in the role. Hitchcock subsequently used her in 'Suspicion' with Cary Grant. She was also excellent in that but 'Rebecca' is a much stronger movie. The supporting cast also includes some brilliant performances, especially Judith Anderson ('Laura') as the extremely creepy Mrs. Danvers, George Sanders who plays Rebecca's slimy cousin, and Nigel Bruce in a typical role as de Winter's bumbling brother-in-law Major Lacy. Sanders subsequently worked again with Hitchcock in 'Foreign Correspondent', and Bruce played Cary Grant's lovable pal "Beaky" in 'Suspicion'. I sometimes think that Hitchcock's 1940s movies are overlooked by many because they are regarded as being too "old fashioned", but for me movies like 'Suspicion', 'Saboteur', 'Lifeboat' and 'Spellbound' are some of the most entertaining movies Hitchcock ever made, and 'Rebecca' is the best of the lot. If you want to be totally enthralled for two hours just watch 'Rebecca'!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Joan Fontaine is so beautiful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I spent the majority of this film thinking about how lucky M. Olivier really was. To be able to wrap his arms around Joan Fontaine and kiss her. Oh my. She's one of the most beautiful women I've ever seen (almost, but not quite as beautiful as Veronica Lake). She's also absolutely perfect in the role of the second Mrs. DeWinter, taking a character that could have become a cloying bore in less capable hands and transforming her into a sympathetic and interesting figure.The movie, on the whole, is similarly amazing, capturing the spirit and the tone of those great Gothic romances. Watching Rebecca, I was reminded (pleasantly) of Wuthering Heights; I do not mean to suggest that in some way this film re-tells the tale of Cathy and Heathcliff, but rather that Rebecca has the feel of Bronte's novel (I am most certainly not talking about the William Wyler adaptation a few years before the release of Rebecca. That's a terrible film that somehow manages to mis-interpret the novel).I must assume that the guiding hand of Hitchcock played no small role in recreating the feel of a Gothic romance. There are very few that would be able to take a love story, infuse it with such gloom, with such a sense of foreboding, and still manage to create something that ends happily without it feeling like a cop-out. I'd also like to draw everyone's attention to the incredibly moving section of the film that occurs between the arrival of the second Mrs. DeWinter at Mandalay and the masqued ball. The emotional strain on the Joan Fontaine character is so palpable, so absolutely taxing, that it actually pains me to watch. I hurt along with her. Few other movies affect me so emotionally - one of them is Vertigo.All in all, this is a fantastic piece of film-making from Hollywood's golden age. Laurence Olivier is in top-form, as he plays the quiet, sad Maxim and George Sanders is positively hateful.10/10 - a visceral masterpiece</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Wonderful Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of my favorite movies of all time. Definitely my favorite classic. There are some that come close, such as Citizen Kane, Spellbound, and Psycho, but none quite compare to this amazing movie.The first thing that you notice is the outstanding cinematography. You have to remember that this movie was made in 1940, when they didn't have the technology we have now. But that first shot of the water beating up against the rocks grabs you and for one split second you wonder if maybe this isn't part of the movie but rather something filmed just recently. But then you see the familiar face of Laurence Olivier, reminding you that this was made 60 years ago, a fact that forever amazes me. The only oscar it won besides Best Picture was well deserved.Another thing that makes it such a wonderful film is the acting. I have debated on whether Laurence Olivier's character, the tortured Maxim de Winter, is the pitiable character or if his second wife played by Joan Fontaine is really the one to feel sorry for. Every time I watch it I see it from a different point of view. Joan Fontaine is excellent. Laurence Olivier is wonderful, but that's no surprise. The only thing that bugs me is that it seems in every movie he's in (well, at least, everything I've seen him in), he always plays the same type of character. But he's extremely good at it, so I suppose it doesn't matter.But although Joan Fontaine and Laurence Olivier are wonderful, Judith Anderson steals the show! The first time I watched the movie, I was immediately grabbed by her stunning performance as the sinister Mrs. Danvers. You hardly notice the other characters when she's in the scene. She acted the part so well that it's strange to imagine that she was any different in real life.With a wonderful storyline, and a very surprising ending, Rebecca well deserves the title as the only of Hitchcock's films to win the oscar for Best Picture. Although it may not be the most famous of all his films, it is without a doubt the greatest</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the first Hitchcock masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Rebecca" was the first Hitchcock film I ever saw, and I was mesmerized by it from the start, convinced that I had to see more of the director's work. It richly deserved the Oscar it received, but it's a real puzzle that the Academy saw fit to withhold a best director award for Hitch. Would one possibly give an award to a work by Picasso and not to Picasso himself?"Rebecca" was the first of the director's American-made films, and it shows. It's quite different from his earlier British-made films, such as "Young and Innocent" and even "The Lady Vanishes," which somehow seem more amateurish by comparison. (I know little of the British cinema of that era, but it's difficult not to conclude that Hollywood was better at producing more sophisticated efforts.) I would even judge "Rebecca" the best of his films of the early 1940s, with the possible exception of "Shadow of a Doubt." It is true, of course, that much of this film has become cliché (remember the spoofs on the old "Carol Burnette Show"!), but it still weathers the decades very well. The acting is uniformly excellent. Olivier is the hardened Maxim de Winter, untitled lord of Manderly, trying to forget the past and given to unexpected bouts of anger and coldheartedness. Fontaine is perfect as the unnamed mousy heroine, innocent yet deeply in love, still carrying with her the aura of an awkward schoolgirl. Even character actor Nigel Bruce, best known for his role in the Sherlock Holmes films, makes an appearance and plays, in effect, Nigel Bruce!But it is Judith Anderson's role as Mrs. Danvers that viewers are likely to remember best. Her presence is as dark and foreboding as that of the deceased Rebecca herself, and Fontaine is evidently cowed by her icy stare and unnervingly formal manner. The dynamics between the two actresses are wonderful. Who could fail to empathize with Fontaine's unenviable position as, in effect, the new employer of such an intimidating personage? On the other hand, Olivier seems quite unfearful of Anderson, despite her representing so much of the past he is trying to block out. This part of the plot (even in the book) never made much sense to me and is unconvincing.As far as I know, this film marked Hitch's first collaboration with composer Franz Waxman, whose haunting score makes it all the more memorable. Waxman's scores are perhaps less obviously cinematic than those of the incomparable Bernard Herrmann, who would score Hitch's films from 1955 to 1966. Contrast the score for "Rebecca" to Herrmann's music for "Citizen Kane" the following year, and you'll immediately hear the difference. Waxman's is more symphonic in the central European style reflective of his own birth and upbringing. Yet it is worth recalling that scoring films was still a new art at this time, and both Waxman and Herrmann were pioneers.Finally, one has to mention the cinematography, which is magnificent. Technically "Rebecca" might have been filmed in colour, which was newly available in 1940. ("Gone with the Wind" was filmed entirely in colour the previous year, while "The Wizzard of Oz" and "The Women" had colour scenes.) But colour would have diminished its impact. The suspense and the ominous sense of impending doom could only have been communicated through the medium of black-and-white and the deft use of light and shade which it affords.In one respect, of course, "Rebecca" is not a typical Hitchcock film. There is no fleeing innocent trying to clear his name of a crime he did not commit. Surprisingly, there isn't even a murder, although its absence was apparently imposed by the Hayes Code and is certainly foreign to Daphne du Maurier's original novel. Some have said that there is more Selznick than Hitchcock in this film, and perhaps there's something to that. Still, if the collaborative effort between the two was not exactly amiable, it was nevertheless successful.In short, this is the first in a string of Hitchcock masterpieces.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In a line-up of great motion pictures, "Rebecca" stands as one of the giants. It is arguably Hitchcock's greatest film effort, replete with jolting, slap-in-the-face plot twists and gothic sets. Dark and moody, the film boasts Sir Laurence Olivier and Joan Fontaine in slam-dunk, dead on performances, George Sanders as the deliciously despicable Jack Favell, and Judith Anderson nearly stealing the show as the eerie, obsessed housekeeper, Mrs. Danvers.

		<fullReview>his movie is a 10 from the very beginning. The casting is brilliant, the story is hauntingly beautiful, the performances are the best of what Hollywood once was, and the sets are of quality design and architecture. The direction is awesome, but it's Hitchcock, and I expect nothing less from his productions.Rebecca is a glamorous, beautiful socialite who has won the hearts of all who knew her. Well, almost all. But a year after her untimely death, her grieving husband near his wit's end, has grown seemingly suicidal and aloof.He engages his grief while on a trip to Monte Carlo, and meets the beautiful personal secretary and maid of a long-time friend, Mrs. Edythe Van Hopper. She is young, naive, and completely unprepared for the life which is awaiting her; all qualities which George Fortescu Maximillian 'Maxim' de Winter finds endearing.I won't detail the events in this movie, as the story itself is quite haunting, with surprises around every turn.This is a definite "must have" in any suspense / horror / Hitchcock / classics movie collection, and a mandatory must see for all fans of all movies.It rates a 10/10 for its absolute perfection, from...the Fiend :.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Haunting atmospheric treasure SPOILER ALERT</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It seems almost superfluous to add to the many laudatory comments this movie has received on this site, but I feel a need to lay some tribute at the altar of this wonderful piece of classic cinema.If you haven't seen the movie, there may be a couple of SPOILERS in this review, but hopefully also some new insights in compensation.As many have noted, the cast is uniformly excellent: the annoying social snob Edith Van Hopper(Florence Bates), Gladys Cooper's kind, sisterly Beatrice, the eerie Mrs. Danvers of Judith Anderson, Olivier's distracted yet explosive Maxim, George Sanders' snide, oily Favell and especially the oft-times underrated second (but unnamed) Mrs. DeWinter of Joan Fontaine.Although not entirely faithful to the Daphne Du Maurier novel, the screen adaptation preserves the haunting ambiance of Du Maurier's work. Rebecca, though never seen, is clearly the central character, but we learn about her all through indirection in the dialogue of the other characters. We are allowed to create her piece by piece in our own minds, which just adds to the engrossing, I-can't-stop-watching, thrust of the movie.The character who actually tells us the most about the real Rebecca is Mrs. Danvers. The erotic attachment of this character to Rebecca is subtle, yet unmistakable. The wonderful scene in which Judith Anderson shows Rebecca's bedroom to Joan Fontaine is breathtaking in its suggestiveness. The West Wing, 'the only room that looks down across the lawn to the sea' has become Mrs. Danvers' private temple to Rebecca. Her loving preservation of Rebecca's possessions, her sensual handling of Rebecca's underclothes, of her diaphanous negligee, of her glamorous furs and then Anderson's almost hypnotic miming of brushing Rebecca's hair as Fontaine sits at Rebecca's dressing table all make this scene an unforgettable sequence. Anderson's acting is absolutely miraculous. She achieves her character with hardly ever a change in her affect, except where a very slight contrasting up tick in energy transforms her in the West Wing scene and in the scene where she coolly suggests that Fontaine leave-by means of a precipitous drop out of the window onto the rocks. It is a performance which I doubt could ever be duplicated.As we later learn of Rebecca's moral character, it also seems that Mrs. Danvers was as much in love with Rebecca's corruption as she was with the woman herself. 'Danny' in a way becomes the embodiment of Rebecca's cold malevolence which still lingers in the mansion.Joan Fontaine could hardly have been better. She, of all the characters, evolves through the movie. She moves in a seamless line from the pitiful, beleaguered companion of Mrs. Van Hopper to her drowned rat arrival at Manderley to the self-assured and supportive wife Maxim wanted and needed. What I found fascinating about this transformation is the imaginative skill of the costume designer. At the beginning, Fontaine's shy little character is dressed like she made terrible selections at a Macy's basement sale. Later as she tries to fill the role of the 'great lady' she believed Rebecca to have been, her clothes always appear too big and totally out of character. Note the black evening dress with the absurdly large flowers across the front and especially the overwhelmingly outsized Garden Party gown she tries to wear to the costume ball. After she learns the truth about Rebecca from Maxim, discovering that he actually loves her as much as he hated Rebecca, Fontaine's costumes become trim, conservative and tasteful, befitting the genuine, grown-up woman she has become.Fittingly, the final scene belongs to Anderson-the frustrated woman robbed of her goddess--who brings the movie to a thundering operatic finish. Although Selznick and Hitchcock repeatedly clashed over this move, it remains a deathless tribute to both men. This movie never loses its fascination and bears repeated watching, each time weaving its wonderful spell anew. It is a must-see, again and again, classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Haunting Hitchcock.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The only Alfred Hitchcock (Oscar-nominated for directing) film to win the Best Picture Oscar, "Rebecca" is one of those typical films from the amazing director that chills, entertains and puts you on the edge of your seat each time you watch it. Joan Fontaine (Oscar-nominated) has just married the very wealthy Laurence Olivier (also Oscar-nominated), but she is haunted by his mysterious housekeeper (a show-stopping Oscar-nominated performance by Judith Anderson) and the memory of the film's titled character (Olivier's late wife). Hitchcock, noted for his subtle sexual under-tones in films spares none of that here as Anderson's character and the late titled character's relationship seemed to go much further than employee-employer. Anderson slowly tries to drive Fontaine to insanity and the end she may accomplish her devious goal. Hitchcock's first real major U.S. debut stunned the Academy and audiences alike and would lead to the coveted Best Picture Oscar. It is not the best film the legendary director ever worked on, but it is still an amazingly good production that works on many cinematic levels. 4.5 out of 5 stars.</fullReview>

It is rare to find a film like this, as it tackles various genres, ranging from being a romance to a mystery to a drama to even a comedy at times, and all without seeming pretentious. The cast is truly magnificent. Judith Anderson is a stunner is a quiet but sinister role, and George Sanders is even more impressive in lively but also sinister performance. Laurence Olivier and Joan Fontaine are perfect for their roles too.

		<fullReview>In his long career, Alfred Hitchcock directed many great films. Rebecca ranks as one of the greatest. It was the only Hitchcock movie to win a Best Picture Oscar and it was his first Hollywood film after leaving England. This was also the first film in which he adapted someone else's work, the famous novel by de Maurier.This film features all the twists and strange characters you would expect from Hitchcock along with the trademark unexpected ending. Sir Laurence Olivier is great, as usual, as Maximillian de Winter. The stunning Joan Fontaine is wonderful as "the Second Mrs. de Winter".

		<fullReview>This fine classic combines a great director, a great story, and a great cast. Any one of those would have made for a good movie, but all three make it an excellent one. Hitchcock's style and eye for detail combine very well with a story (from a novel that is extremely good in its own right) filled with psychological fear and settings that are interesting and suggestive.Most of the time the story itself moves fairly slowly, allowing the focus to be on the characters, but there are also a couple of very good plot twists, which can be very surprising if you've not seen the movie or read the novel. So if you happen not to know the story, it's a good idea to see the film before reading a lot of comments about it. Laurence Olivier, Joan Fontaine, Judith Anderson, and George Sanders are all perfectly cast and do a wonderful job bringing their characters to life, and making you feel a part of the story."Rebecca" should be satisfying not only to any Hitchcock fan, but to anyone who likes classic movies. Whether you like romance, suspense, or drama, they're all here, and put together by a director and cast that are masters of their art.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are two moments of cinematic greatness in this film. 1)The home movie scene, and 2)the scene involving Danvers manipulating Joan Fontaine after the costume ball. But though these memorable instances attempt to cajole us into admiration during the viewing, the overall product beckons us to reexamine our initial wooing. There are a few other moments of atmospheric success, and Fontaine's initial arrival and exploration of Manderlay and its characters is interesting, but otherwise, the film is often mediocre, and sometimes even poor. Laurence Olivier is very stale and does not exude much of a presence, nor a riveting sense of charm. Fontaine is better, but her character is completely over-the-top. She seems well adjusted and interesting at first, then does nothing but shake and stand with lost eyes for the rest of the film. I know the situation is supposed to bring about such behavior, but it is just too much. The chemistry between the two characters is horrible. Perhaps that is supposed to demonstrate the awkwardness in their relationship. But, then we find de Winter really does love her, and he hates his dead wife. So while his madness translates well, his supposed love for her never does. Not even at the end. And hers for him feels impossible to get our heads around, since he never does anything but be rich and handsome to impress her. I know, I know, those are the dynamics of the relationship, and some of them are more subtle (e.g. de Winter probably goes for her because she seems sexually tame and timidly obsequious), but it still does not feel right in the end. The characters' actions are too shortsighted for the overall plot.The film often has no momentum, and drags on forever. The entire opening courtship can be eliminated since it is not efficacious in convincing us of much romance anyway. Then there is the second part, where Fontaine slowly learns the secrets of Manderlay, and though this probably is the best part of the film, it still never feels like it is building to a climax, even though every scene attempts to convey a bit of foreboding intrigue. Instead, it becomes monotonous; precisely because every scene is exactly the same. The end feels like it should approach soon after Danvers diabolical rant. Then there is Olivier's admission, and it feels like it should come again. But again it doesn't, and when the ending finally does come, it is of such an enormous magnitude that it feels too brief.Then there is the story, which I believe has a couple of plot holes, and realistic dilemmas, though I cannot say with absolute certainty. The film has a chance, but not without a reassessment of the script. Another chance at astonishing greatness blown.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Do you think the dead come back and watch the living?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rebecca is directed by Alfred Hitchcock and adapted to screen play from the Daphne du Maurier novel of the same name. It stars Laurence Olvier, Joan Fontaine and Judith Anderson. Cinematography is by George Barnes and music scored by Franz Waxman.After meeting and marrying 'Maxim' de Winter (Olivier), the Second Mrs. de Winter (Fontaine), finds life at his English estate, Manderley, far from comfortable because the servants and the house serve to remind her of the first Mrs. de Winter, whose death remains a source of mystery. What did happen to the first lady of the house? Can this newly married couple survive the oppressive cloud that looms large over the mansion?A Gothic emotional near masterpiece, Alfred Hitchcock's first American film may seem a bit too serviceable at times, something he was also aware of himself, but the production values are high and the story is played out supremely well. Within the story we can find Hitchcock's now famous trait of mistrusting Women, but in the main it stays the tragic tale of one young woman living in the ominous shadow of the previous Mrs. De Winter. Mood is often set as foreboding, with the director understanding the psychological pangs of the source material once the action switches to the de Winter home of Manderley. It arguably is a touch too long, and the restraint of Hitchcock, down to producer David O. Selznick overseeing things, stops it being a bit more unnerving than it should be.For Manderley the mansion here is one of the finest put on the screen, this is because Hitchcock and brilliant cinematographer George Barnes manage to make it bold &amp; beautiful one minute, and then the next scene it comes off as a monolithic nightmare. It's wonderful case of the surroundings playing the extra character for maximum effect. Laurence Olivier is impressive, even if we would learn later on that this is the sort of performance he could do in his sleep. The supporting cast do great work as well, especially as regards the cold and terrifying turn from Judith Anderson as Mrs. Danvers. However, to me this will always be Joan Fontaine's show, she nails it perfectly, the new Mrs. De Winter wants to do right but can't seem to so for doing wrong, she infuriates at times, yet the next minute you just want to hold her, for she's so vulnerable, but beautifully so, it's a brilliant performance in a brilliant film. The ending is a switheroo from the novel, and it almost derails the success the film has achieved up to that point. And looking at it now it's hard not to curse the Production Code for enforcing a big change to what was revealed in du Maurier's wonderful novel. But the film has survived the "appeasing" ending to stand the test of time for all the ages. It won the Academy Award for Best Picture, and Barnes also won for Best Black &amp; White Cinematography, it was nominated for a further nine awards, including Best Director, Best Actor, Best Actress and Best Supporting Actress. No nomination for Waxman, sadly, but his score is worthy of a mention for the evocative strains that sit nicely with the tone of the story. Rebecca, a hauntingly beautiful picture that's acted and produced with consummate skill. 9.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a Daphne Du Maurier's story (from a best-seller novel) concerning a prominent widower (Laurence Olivier) called Maxim De Winter who finds a gorgeous and timid young girl (Joan Fontaine) who is serving to an old Mistress (Florence Bates) . They are married and head to Manderley , the familiar mansion (in the exterior actually is a scale model). But Maxim is haunted by the ghost first wife , an enigmatic Rebecca , who died in mysterious circumstances . There works as a servant the creepy and obsessive housekeeper , Mrs Danvers (Judith Anderson,a famous stage actress in her most important role) and sh meets a cynic gentleman (George Sanders).This film has suspense , romance , unlimited tension , full of lingering images and with the typical touches Hitchcock . Besides , a literately and thoughtful dialog signed by Joan Harrison (Hitchcock's usual screenwriter) though lacking humor . After ¨39 steps¨and ¨Jamaica Inn¨ , Hitch was encouraged to go to America and promptly shot his first work in Hollywood hired by the great producer David O'Selznick . Fine performance by Laurence Olivier , he married Vivien Leigh and he wished to her as protagonist but Hitch hired Joan Fontaine who took seven rehearsal sessions until the engaging . Joan Fontaine as a shy bride young is superb and enjoyable . Judith Anderson as a spooky and cold house keeper is top-notch, her role as obsessed person by the glamorous Rebecca is unforgotten and immortal .

		<shortDescription>My favorite Hitch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILERS ABOUND!!!!`Last night I dreamt I was at Manderly again.' As with Daphne DuMaurier's novel, so begins Alfred Hitchcock's classic film adaptation, and the only one of his films to be awarded an Academy Award for Best Picture. It should also be noted that the film also won an Oscar for Best Cinematography, Black and White. Hitchcock, Fontaine, Olivier, and Anderson were also nominated in their respective categories.Rebecca was Alfred Hitchcock's first American movie, and much has been written about the interference by David O. Selznick with its production. That is not the purpose of this review, though. Frankly, I don't know all that much about what went on behind the scenes, but I do know that the resulting film is a masterpiece.Rebecca can be divided into three parts: Monte Carlo, Manderly, and the inquest after the discovery of Rebecca' sunken boat.At Monte Carlo, we are introduced to Joan Fontaine's character, a complete nonentity (in fact, we never learn her real name) who is serving as a paid companion to Mrs. Van Hopper, an obnoxious, wealthy matron delightfully played by Florence Bates. While there, she meets George Fortescu Maximillian de Winter (Maxim for short,played by Laurence Olivier), fabulously wealthy and as charming as Mrs. Van Hopper is boorish. Maxim has been traveling trying to recover from his first wife Rebecca's untimely death in a drowning accident. At the end of her stay at Monte Carlo, the young woman is surprised to have Maxim ask her to marry him, although not with as much romance as she would probably have liked, and much to the consternation of her erstwhile employer Mrs. Van Hopper.The movie then takes us to Manderly, the palatial family estate of the de Winter family. Here Fontaine's character truly finds herself out of her depth as the new mistress of Manderly. Not only has she never had to deal with such a large house and a retinue of servants, but she gets a decidedly chilly reception from Mrs. Danvers (Judith Anderson), and everywhere she goes and everyone with whom she speaks reminds her of the beauty and accomplishments of Rebecca. She feels overwhelmed by the specter of Maxim's first wife and of his abiding love for her. Not only that, but Fontaine's character is treated like a child, both in Monte Carlo and at Manderly, whether it is in the dismissive way of Mrs. Van Hopper, the fatherly manner of Maxim, or in the gently patronizing way of Frith, Manderly's head butler. One gets the feeling that the new Mrs. de Winter is a child lost in this great house, afraid of making any false steps.Judith Anderson is amazing as Mrs. Danvers. Although she never raises her voice, and always speaks with seeming respect to her new mistress, Anderson nonetheless allows Mrs. Danver's malevolence to come through. She is the archetype for all the cold-hearted housekeepers who have come since, and none can match her. She never lets Mrs. de Winter forget Rebecca and how she was loved by everyone, especially Maxim. Haunted by the specter of Rebecca, the new Mrs. de Winter seems to feel like an intruder, trespassing on Rebecca's home and sleeping in her bed.Mrs. Danvers finally reveals the depth of her hatred by suggesting a costume for Mrs. de Winter to wear at a party that was originally worn by Rebecca. After Maxim's expected negative reaction, Mrs. Danvers urges her, in arguably the most memorable scene in the movie, to commit suicide by throwing herself from the window. Mrs. de Winter is saved, though, by the wreck of a boat near Manderly and the noise of the rescue that is undertaken.During the course of the rescue, another boat is found: the one in which Rebecca died. Having discovered Rebecca's corpse inside, it is announced that an inquest must take place to investigate her death. When his wife tries to comfort Maxim, he reveals to her the truth behind his relationship with Rebecca: that he hated her, and was trapped by her into a sham of a marriage. He also tells her of how Rebecca died; that he had killed her in a rage and sunk the boat with her body inside. After this revelation, a change comes over the new Mrs. de Winter: she grows up, and is visibly more self-assured. She and Maxim, to a certain extent, reverse roles, in that he loses hope and she must comfort him and reassure him that all will be well, when in fact all seems hopeless. She is now truly the mistress of Manderly.During the inquest, it is discovered that Rebecca's boat was scuttled, and had not capsized as was previously thought. Circumstantial evidence begins to pile up against Maxim, until a visit to Rebecca's personal physician reveals her ultimate betrayal and clears Maxim's name.Rebecca is, essentially, a drama of mystery and romance, and in lesser hands it could easily fall into the trap of melodrama. But Hitchcock's deft direction, the superb cinematography, and the outstanding performances by the entire cast make it one of the greatest romances ever made, and one of my favorite films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Absolutely perfect Gothic Thriller that has many imitators but few of equal quality.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With "Rebecca" about to hit the Broadway stage (as a musical!), I thought it was time to write my review of perhaps my favorite Hitchcock film. I recall the first time I saw this on TV almost 30 years ago on the late show, I had set my VCR to tape it, but woke up to start watching a bit of it, and stayed up all night to watch it all. That's how good a film it is. Daphne Du Maurier's tale of a shy companion who shocks her employer by winning the most desired wealthy widow in England is gripping, suspenseful, and filled with innuendo. Joan Fontaine never gave a more lovely performance as the awkward bride who leaves her hysterically selfish employer (Florence Bates) to marry the brooding Maxim De Winter (Laurence Olivier) and finds animosity from the darkly dressed Mrs. Danver (Judith Anderson) who resents her intrusion because of her devotion to Maxim's late wife, Rebecca. The mystery of how Rebecca died and what kind of woman she really was is explored, and with the intrusion of scoundrel George Sanders and some well-meaning advice from Maxim's toothy sister (Gladys Cooper), the new Mrs. De Winter (her first name is never revealed) finds out more than she bargained for.If you thought Olivier's Heathcliff in "Wuthering Heights" was dark and somewhat depressing, wait until you meet his more civilized Maxim. Joan Fontaine's bride is as far from Merle Oberon's "wild and sweet" Cathy as you can find, but as far as Gothic tales of brooding men and their lost souls go, the two movies make a perfect double feature. Samuel Goldwyn and David Selznick were Hollywood's most famous independent producers, so sometimes their careers are compared. They share many of the same players, and in the case of these two films, the same photographer (Gregg Toland). Fontaine and Olivier work well on screen together, even though they apparently did not share a close working relationship. It is, however, the supporting players who are the shining stars. Anderson's Mrs. Danvers is a role we've already seen on screen (usually played by Gale Sondergaard), but being Anderson's second film (and first in 7 years), there was a lot of curiosity surrounding her considering her reputation as one of Broadway's hottest dramatic actresses. Mrs. Danvers isn't a one dimensional evil housekeeper; You understand her affection for the late Rebecca from the very beginning, and in every movement Anderson makes, you cannot take your eyes off of her. I can't praise her highly enough. Sanders' suave villain (who playfully calls Mrs. Danvers "Danny") is extremely likable and almost equal in stealing away the attention of the leads. Gladys Cooper and Nigel Bruce add on a delightful "pip pip" quality to their eccentric characters, while in her brief time on screen, Florence Bates is hysterically funny, putting out a cigarette in her cold cream, and coolly telling Fontaine how she can never truly be a "great lady".Every moment here is a classic movie memory, from the opening narration to Fontaine's first vision of De Winter, and then, the rainy ride down to where Fontaine sees Mandalay for the first time. The light first quarter darkens the moment we see Anderson pop into view as Mrs. Danvers. A cold pause, then "How Do You Do" reveals the tension, and from there, everything is set. Anderson explodes in two scenes-the first where she finds the hiding Fontaine in Rebecca's old room, and later, when Fontaine confronts Anderson after discovering her treachery. The film sags just a bit with the discovery of a body that might be Rebecca's, but that is minor. C. Aubrey Smith is memorable in his small role as Maxim's attorney. The final shot will live on in your memory, just as Mandalay lived on in the second Mrs. De Winter's.While "Rebecca" won Best Film at that year's Academy Awards, many film historians prefer the message drama "The Grapes of Wrath" as the better film. I find the two rank very close, and also quibble over between the choice of Jane Darwell for Supporting Actress over Anderson's Mrs. Danvers. A big mistake was not nominating Sanders. A BBC version years later is also very good, a bit more faithful to the novel, and benefits from Diana Rigg as a more approachable Mrs. Danvers and a very diva-ish performance by Faye Dunaway in the Florence Bates role.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sucks you in totally...a high romance with astonishing sets and photography</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rebecca (1940)Ah, to see another great movie from those few years when Hollywood peaked, when that combination of art, freshness, and sheer collaborative talent combined over and over. I'm talking from Gone with the Wind to Casablanca, 1939 to 1942. Throw in any number of truly staggering movies in the stretch--Citizen Kane for starters--and we have to almost expect Alfred Hitchcock to fit right in. With Rebecca he does. It's another perfect movie.Daphne Du Maurier's book of the same title is a great read, something short of a literary classic but something better than a mere best-seller. I read it recently, and was completely transported into a land of subtle drama. That sounds like an oxymoron, but when you see this movie you'll notice how people act with restraint, with glances, with quiet actions, and yet achieve a grandiose, dramatic effect that tears your heart out. It's an archetypal story about a girl who seems to have a dream come true marrying a charming and very wealthy man.But of course, there are skeletons in this man's closet, and Lawrence Olivier plays the inner struggle of Maxim close to the chest. More openly troubled by events, and so sympathetic your heart jumps out of your chest, is the girl, his wife, played by Joan Fontaine. Now here is a performance that is just incredible. She even changes her presence as her innocence slowly bleeds away from start to finish. If the two of them never quite have sparks fly, they're not supposed to. But Hitchcock has done more than chosen a great, cinematic novel and two amazing actors (as well as a flawless supporting cast). With the most romantic, lush sets, delirious lights, and rich, layered photography, all fluidly combined to create scenes so beautiful you can almost taste it, the director has shown, again, that he understands the intuitive power of the cinema. It isn't the outward brilliance of any one scene or shot, or any one conversation that the camera follows invisibly, or any flinging of the curtains to reveal only more fog or sheer obscurity. It's the pacing and sequence of these moments that sucks you into the world and won't let you go.Well, it's no surprise, maybe, that Rebecca won best picture and best cinematography at the Oscars. And it was up against The Letter, The Grapes of Wrath, and The Philadelphia Story, all of which are more proof that the movies of this period are a zenith of a certain kind of Hollywood. The studio system. (Yes, there are hundreds of other great movies from other years, but I'm not really trying to make my case here.) Hitchcock never won an Oscar for best director (neither did Welles), but he could have here without fault. As much as this is just a movie to get lost in and enjoy, it's also a movie you could watch over and over and study.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rebecca (1940)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an excellent film and it was directed by no other than the infamous Alfred Hitchcock.This film starts out with some amazing music. The introduction starts out with suspenseful and then changes into classical romance music. The narration of a woman wishing to return to Mandeley. The film portrays a young woman who falls in love with a millionaire Maxim De Winters and marries him.They leave for Maxim's home called Mandeley. During the 2nd wifes time at Mandeley, she is constantly reminded and compared to the first Mrs. De Winters-Rebecca. No one ever calls the 2nd wife by her first name, she is always referred to as dear, sweetheart or Mrs. Da Winters. Throughout her stay at Mandeley, the 2nd Mrs. De Winters grows extremely concerned for her relationship with Maxim. She also fears the housekeeper Ms. Danvers.The lighting and sound for this movies was right on. I loved the scene at the cottage with Maxim and the 2nd Mrs De Winters. As always with a Hitchcock film there are twists in the plot. However I never thought it would end the way it did. I loved this film!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Ageless And Timeless Hitchock Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on the novel by Daphne du Maurier, the classic psychological thriller Rebecca was Alfred Hitchcock's first American project. The film's screenplay was an adaptation by Joan Harrison and Robert E. Sherwood from Philip MacDonald's and Michael Hogan's adaptation of Daphne du Maurier's novel of the same title.It features Laurence Olivier as the aristocratic widower Maxim de Winter, Joan Fontaine as his second wife, and Judith Anderson as the housekeeper, Mrs. Danvers.It is a Gothic tale about the lingering memory of the title character, Maxim de Winter's dead first wife, which continues to haunt Maxim, his new bride, and Mrs. Danvers.A young woman works as a companion to the well-to-do Mrs. Van Hopper.She meets the wealthy widower Maxim de Winter in Monte Carlo, where they fall in love and get married. Maxim takes his new bride to Manderlay, a large country estate in Cornwall. However, the mansion's many servants refuse to accept her as the new lady of the house. They seem to be loyal to Maxim's first wife, Rebecca, who died under mysterious circumstances. Particularly cruel to her is the prim housekeeper Mrs. Danvers, who is obsessed with Rebecca. She continually attests to her beauty and virtues and even preserves her former bedroom as a shrine. The new Mrs. de Winter is nearly driven to madness as she begins to doubt her relationship with her husband and the presence of Rebecca starts to haunt her. Eventually, an investigation leads to the revelation about Rebecca's true nature.Hitchcock's first American film is a masterpiece of haunting atmosphere, Gothic thrills, and gripping suspense.It's an elegant production, beautifully photographed and designed like a dream house shrouded in mourning, but it also favors the pictorial over the cinematic and surface over subtext.Added to that,this classic female Gothic romance, beautifully adapted from Daphne du Maurier's novel is hauntingly accompanied by Franz Waxman's score.And it offers no overt violence or thrills, it is a model of sustained mystery and eerie suspense.Overall,it is an ageless, timeless adult movie about a woman who marries a widower but fears she lives in the shadow of her predecessor.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Simply the Best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have no qualms with holding my hands up and saying that 'I am a Laurence Olivier nut'. I would quite happily shout it from the rooftops for everyone to hear. Despite my stellar age of 24 I'm proud that I own all the films of his that I can own at present and I have at least watched the ones I haven't. Larry was the reason I chose to watch 'Rebecca' in the first place and yet once I was finished, it became apparent to me that I could have loved the film regardless of who played Max.Never has a film captured me so intently that watching it never seizes to be a pleasure. Just hearing that first, beautiful line. The simple and yet effective way that Joan Fontaine opens what goes on to be two hours of stunning film, is nothing but superb...I could watch it all day.For somebody who's not a huge fan of black and white films, I'd probably always recommend this as a good place to start. The storyline is one that everyone can follow and make sense of. The love story is beautiful in the way it unfolds and the characters are intriguing.Whilst Larry does make a stunning Maxim - brash, haughty, elegant, and yet caring underneath; it's really Joan Fontaine's character of Mrs Du Winter, who is truly deserving of the praise. Utterly and truly believable as a timid, awkward and shy young woman in love, she breaks out at the end to show the strength all woman have lurking underneath, (props must be given to Mr Hitchcock for playing on Ms Fontaines insecurities through filming as well)'Rebecca' is a film that will forever be relevant in time, and I know that I will cherish this movie for the rest of my life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Magnificent Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Date: 18 July, 2012 -First Time Watch- I love old Hollywood movies, mostly because they had good story lines and fantastic acting. Alfred Hitchcock does an amazing job with this in almost every movie he did. 'Rebecca' is an example of a another amazing old Hollywood film. The story opens with Joan Fontaine finds Laurence Olivier (he was so young and I felt oddly attracted to him) on the ledge of a cliff, ready to jump in. She stops him and they met up again later that day. They spend lots of time with each other and soon marry, despite the fact that Ms. Fontaine is unprepared for her new role as Olivier's wife. Trouble only continues when Ms. Fontaine arrives at the large estate and finds that everyone, especially the head maid Miss. Danvers, compares her to the greatly loved Rebecca, Olivier's first wife who died tragically a year before when she took her boat out by herself and drowned. But, as always Mr. Hitchcock throws in several twists and turns with a surprising conclusion. Definitely a very well done film with plenty of action and suspense to keep you interested.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A movie that takes you to Mandeley, a mansion and leaves you in the midst of a mystery.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Winner, Best Picture, 1941.A typical Hitchock-ian thriller combined with a few brilliant performances by the cast. The movie begins like a typical Romance flick of the late 30s but as the movie goes on, the plot gets interesting. I was certain that the movie would be a vapid experience, but i was forced to budge.One mistress makes way to another, one mystery gives rise to another. The review is incomplete without praising Hitchcock's direction, the editing and the brilliant camera work that add to the suspense and tense moments that the movie is totally comprised of.And like every Hitchcock movie, it has a denouement that really makes your perception of the film till that moment go astray leaving you shell-shocked as to how he could turn the story like the steering wheel of a car.Hats off!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Never seen a Rebecca</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You never see Rebecca throughout the movie, yet she captivates you as the audience for the most part. Her beauty, wits and most importantly how she had managed to admire so many people all at once while maintaining her solemnity with everyone except her husband. Without going into too much depth, this movie will captivate you, confuse you and still manage to not deprive you of the very curiosity you will crave for. But a vintage masterpiece you shouldn't pass by. There are some scenes however which I felt could have been dealt with in greater detail, but considering this is an old classic, one must realize there are some things better not to expect. Enjoy it as is. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The very definition of "Haunting"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was quite interested in the film while I was watching it, but when it ended, I didn't feel impacted. Very soon afterwards, however, my mind began to feel very heavy. The first words of the film came floating back to me: "Last night I dreamt I went to Manderly again." I ruminated over the events of the film, and I began to tear up a bit. It creates one of the most unsettling atmospheres ever to exist in a film. I still feel enshrouded in the mist and smoke that curled around Manderly. I can tell that this is going to be one of those films that, when I recall it to memory, I will fall back into its mood. I can't say this for too many films.One of the reasons that I connected with it so tightly was the main character, the narrator, the new Mrs. de Winter. Joan Fontaine was perfect in this film. Out of the ones with whom I am familiar, I don't think that there is another Hitchcock heroine who was as well developed. Kim Novak's character Judy from Vertigo was close, and so was Janet Leigh's character Marion Crane from Psycho. Those two heroines provoked great pity in my soul. But the heroine of Rebecca beats them all.I was completely involved with her. She begins as little more than a slave to a domineering woman, Edythe van Hopper (their relationship was a little confusing to me; a hired friend? This made me suspicious. I think that there was a lot of suggestive lesbianism in this film, perhaps between van Hopper and the heroine, but definitely between Rebecca and Ms. Danvers. Watch as she delicately shows the second Mrs. de Winters Rebecca's underwear. Also notice that Rebecca used Ms. Danvers' name at the doctor's office, having gone there to find out whether or not she was pregnant). The heroine only escapes from one owner to go to her next owner, Maxim de Winters. He treats her even more cruelly than Edythe van Hopper did, calling her a "little fool" and an "idiot." When he called her those names and reprimanded her, I trembled. As the movie went on, I think my mind actually became fused with the heroine's. I started to cry when she did after Ms. Danvers tortured her psychologically. When Ms. Danvers tried to convince her to jump out of the window, I felt as if I was about to fall to my death.I became rather disappointed when the focus moves from the heroine to Maxim. His predicament became more interesting near the end, but my sympathies, my whole attention were squarely focused on Fontaine's character. Thus arose my initial impression of the film. This small disruption can be forgiven, because the film as a whole just remains in my mind as a sad, beautiful masterpiece.Rebecca is one of Hitchcock's best films. Definitely a 10/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Rebecca is one film I could watch over and over. It is definitely one of Hitchcock's masterpieces. I recently saw the DVD version for the first time, which had the screen tests and some of Selznick's memos. My favorite was the memo that said, "Please don't say anything to Larry and Vivien" referring to the fact that Vivien Leigh wanted the Fontaine role so that she could be with Olivier. Though her second screen test was better than her first, in my mind, I've always pictured Leigh as the actual Rebecca, were she ever shown.The casting is perfect, with Joan Fontaine as the insecure Mrs. de Winter, coldly manipulated and laughed at by Mrs. Danvers, as expertly portrayed by Judith Anderson. Jack Favell is Rebecca's sly cousin, beautifully played by George Sanders. Olivier is gorgeous as Max, mysterious and distant. He utters two of the all-time most devastating lines heard in a relationship: "Happiness is something I know very little about. If you say we're happy, let's leave it at that." I have one quibble with "Rebecca," which is very minor. There were just a few too many shots of Rebecca's initials. But I loved seeing that R in the last shot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Great Hitchcock Classics</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is strange that after arriving in Hollywood from Britain, Alfred Hitchcock should have chosen to base his first film upon a novel by Daphne du Maurier, the same author, who had provided him with the material for the last film of his British period. "Jamaica Inn" was one of his few failures, a minor-league costume drama that is today of little interest except to Hitchcock completists. With "Rebecca", however, he achieved one of his greatest successes, even though the story is hardly typical of his work.A number of Hitchcock's films, such as "The 39 Steps" or "North by North-West" end up with the hero and heroine falling in love, but are nevertheless essentially suspense films with an element of romance. "Rebecca", however, is essentially a romance with elements of suspense. Indeed, it starts out as a romantic comedy. A young woman (we never learn her name) staying on the French Riviera with her employer Mrs Van Hopper, meets and falls in love with Maxim de Winter, a handsome older widower. There is a brief comic sequence as the two lovers try to outwit the overbearing, bullying Mrs Van Hopper and escape back to England.With the shift in location to England, the mood of the film becomes darker and more serious. We learn that Maxim is the wealthy owner of Manderley, a stately home near the Cornish coast, and that he was widowed about a year earlier when his first wife Rebecca drowned in a boating accident. The new Mrs de Winter finds it difficult to adapt to her new role as the mistress of such a large house, especially as she feels that everyone, including the servants and Maxim's friends, is comparing her unfavourably with the beautiful and accomplished Rebecca. Maxim reveals to her that his first marriage was an unhappy one as Rebecca was compulsively promiscuous and betrayed him with a number of lovers. This revelation does not, however, put her mind at rest, because evidence soon comes to light that suggests that Maxim may have killed Rebecca out of jealousy.The "suspense" elements of the film only occur near the end, when Maxim has to struggle to clear himself from suspicion of murder. There are no typical Hitchcock set-pieces like the crop-duster in "North by North-West" or the shower scene in "Psycho". This is, however, one of the most atmospheric of Hitchcock's films. Although it was shot in California, the morning mists, the pine trees by the rocky coast and the Gothic mansion are all suggestive of England. (I suspect that if Hollywood were to make the film today they would try to Americanise it, but in the forties their attitude to British literature was generally more respectful).In a way this is a ghost story, although not in the literal sense of a tale of supernatural happenings. Manderley may not be literally haunted, but it is permeated by Rebecca's spirit. The old house is solid and luxurious, but it also has an oppressive air, especially for Mrs de Winter. (Max Ophuls was to conjure up a similar atmosphere in "Caught", made a few years later). Rebecca does not actually appear in the film; she does not appear in the book either, but that is a first-person narrative told from the viewpoint of her successor. In the film, where the first-person perspective is largely abandoned, it would have been much easier to show her in flashback, but Hitchcock chose to resist this temptation. In my view he was right to do so. Rebecca is far more frightening as an unseen but malevolent and brooding presence than she would be if seen in the flesh.Mrs de Winter is an outsider at Manderley, partly because she is from a less privileged social background than Maxim, partly because she is the only character who never knew Rebecca personally. Maxim was probably attracted to her precisely because she was so unlike Rebecca. As she is supposed to be somewhat plain and dowdy, Joan Fontaine, one of the most attractive actresses of the period, was perhaps not physically right for the role. (Joanna David, in the 1979 TV production, seemed closer to du Maurier's conception of the character). Nevertheless, Fontaine's interpretation of the role is a very good one, making her shy and bewildered but possessed of an inner strength which enables her love for Maxim to survive.Laurence Olivier is also good as Maxim, bringing out the two sides of his character. On the one hand he is the calm, self-possessed English gentleman, on the other a man haunted by his past. The other performance which stands out is that of Judith Anderson as the sinister housekeeper Mrs Danvers. Always dressed in black, with a severe hairstyle, moving silently through the house, Mrs Danvers initially greets the new Mrs de Winter with an icy formality, but gradually becomes her chief tormentor. Although this could not be explicitly stated in the forties, there is a strong hint that Mrs Danvers is a lesbian and that she might have been in love with Rebecca. Certainly, the scene in which she stands lasciviously pawing her late employer's underwear is highly suggestive.It certainly seemed eccentric of the Academy to give this film the "Best Picture" award while withholding "Best Director" from Hitchcock. 1940 was, however, a very strong year in the history of the cinema and, excellent film though "Rebecca" is, I am not sure that it is necessarily a greater one than John Ford's "The Grapes of Wrath", Chaplin's "The Great Dictator" or "The Philadelphia Story", all of which were nominated. I suspect that the decision to give "Best Picture" to "Rebecca" and "Best Director" to Ford may have been a deliberate attempt to spread the honours more evenly. Nevertheless, "Rebecca" remains one of the great Hitchcock classics. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>On The Road To Manderley</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've always found it curious that of all the films Alfred Hitchcock directed Rebecca was the one that wound up with the Best Picture Oscar and that Hitchcock didn't receive Best Director for it. Usually those two go together. John Ford won his second Oscar for Best Director for The Grapes of Wrath that year instead. Also Laurence Olivier, Joan Fontaine and Judith Anderson were nominated and all came up short.Off the top of my head I would say Vertigo, North By Northwest, Shadow of a Doubt, and Spellbound are all qualitatively better than Rebecca. Yet Rebecca does have a nice Gothic horror feel to it though there is nothing supernatural going on here.Laurence Olivier plays Maxim DeWinter, heir to the estate of Manderley who is in Monte Carlo looking to get away from the place because of the death of his first wife Rebecca. She was by all accounts a regal beauty who was the toast of society and he's in mourning for her loss. But he meets Joan Fontaine a nice, but plain sort of girl who is the paid companion of American dowager Florence Bates. Maybe because she's the opposite of Rebecca he's attracted to her. Fontaine grabs him on the spot when marriage is proposed.Fontaine has a lot of insecurities much like her character in a following Hitchcock film, Suspicion. They're not eased any by Judith Anderson the housekeeper of the big Manderley estate.Mrs. Danvers was Judith's career role. Before writing this review I remarked to someone else that I wonder what Mr. Danvers must have been like. It occurred to me later that there was no Mr. Danvers, he exists only as an excuse or a pretense so there would be no whispers about her unmarried status. She pretends to be a widow. There's more than just latent lesbianism in Judith Anderson's portrayal. She was totally in love with the late Rebecca DeWinter and I'm sure it got good and physical. She can't stand seeing anyone else in taking her place. Since it comes out that Rebecca was fooling around with her cousin George Sanders, why not a lesbian affair as well. If Rebecca were written today, Mrs. Danvers would be more openly lesbian.Rebecca was the first of Alfred Hitchcock's American films as well, though it was done here it was done by the English colony in Hollywood. Hitchcock never had budgets that Selznick gave him over in the UK. The sets depicting the grandeur of Manderley are an eye full. Than again so were the sets of Tara in Selznick's Best Picture of the previous year, Gone With the Wind.Rebecca is a good mixture of mystery, Gothic horror, and romance served up quite nicely by Alfred Hitchcock.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>REBECCA, an enthralling adaptation of the Daphne Du Maurier novel, is probably the closest that Hitchcock got in his career to making a traditional 'haunted house' film. Certainly his adaptation of the classic book is laden with Gothic dread, as a newly-wed bride moves into the ancestral home of her husband and discovers that the spirit of his dead wife is very much alive and out to bring her down.REBECCA is a highly effective non-supernatural horror/mystery flick, with expert direction (of course) and a mature approach to the storyline. It may be a little slow for modern tastes, but this gives the director the chance to let the audience experience the nuances and delightful atmosphere of the storyline.Joan Fontaine is fantastic as the new Mrs. de Winter in one of those 'being driven out of her mind' type roles. Laurence Olivier is more than effective in his ambiguous part. The supporting parts are particularly well judged, with a well-placed cameo for Leo G. Carroll, another humorous bumbling part for Nigel Bruce, and George Sanders appearing as a delightful cad. The latter part of the film, where the mystery begins to be cleared up, is particularly well-handled, leading to a gripping climax. As for Judith Anderson as the housekeeper Mrs. Danvers...well, she'll go down in the pantheon of Hitchcock villains as one of his creepiest and most ruthless!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Joan Fontaine (Mrs de Winter) is a companion to the very snobby and highly amusing Florence Bates (Mrs Van Hopper). While holidaying in Monte Carlo, they bump into Laurence Olivier (Maxim) who is mega wealthy and owns the stately home of Mandalay in Cornwall. A romance between Joan and Larry develops behind the back of fussy Florence, and by the end of their stay in Monte Carlo, Joan and Larry are engaged. They marry and return to Mandalay but the overbearing presence of Olivier's first wife "Rebecca" still lurks at every corner. But, things are not as they seem?.The film left me thinking about how I would feel about Olivier's character if I watched the film for a second time. I would definitely view him in a different light now that I know the story. You have to get to that point to understand what I mean as things take a very different turn about three quarters of the way through and his motivations become very different to what has been previously assumed. It's a clever twist. Up to that three-quarter way mark, I found that Olivier, Fontaine and housekeeper Judith Anderson (Mrs Danvers) were all too predictable and that the film was a little long. However, things pick up with the discovery of Rebecca's boat.The cast are uniformly good with George Sanders (Favell) standing out as a cad. He is elegantly sublime and slimy as he looks out for number one. At the other extreme was Fontaine ? I'm not keen on feeble female roles and so she grated on me on several occasions. Chicks in films need to be funny or be ready to fight back. None of this drippy stuff.A couple of things that I didn't notice during the film ? Hitchcock's usual appearance (it is there, though), and the fact that Joan Fontaine's character doesn't have a first name! The film is a little long but it's worth it in the end.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Rebecca is a beautifully made film that, every time I watch it, sticks with me for some time after. Hitchcock masterfully uses the medium of film to mirror the story he is telling. The way the images flow across the screen is haunting, beautiful and adds so much to the emotional resonance of each moment. I think what I love most about Rebecca is how many scenes revel in the quiet and in sparse dialogue. Words are being said, but you can hear the characters holding back torrents of emotions and thoughts. This is especially true in scenes between Mrs. Danvers and the new Mrs. De Winter. I can't say enough about the actress who portrays Mrs. Danvers. I found myself so drawn to her character while at the same time completely creeped out by her. This is how you do horror!Definitely my favorite Hitchcock film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Deliciously perverse, like reading a Mishima novel, where his fiction-- transgressive, in its own way-- describes characters operating in backward, ultra-traditional society, with all its subtleties and superficialities. The filmmaking is also excellently amoral: where a lesser filmmaker might have defaulted to making everything work out neatly and happily for the [ apparently "good"] ostensible protagonists, Hitchcock allows the medium itself to dictate the film's trajectory, and the result is satisfactory both to those who want to see the protagonists "happy," and those of us rooting for George Sanders' character and/or Judith Anderson's [ the latter's epic death scene, for example, works both ways], simply because it's -so cinematic,- and fun to watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic Hitchcock Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>He is the master of suspense. And this movie is another great example of probably cinemas greatest director of all time. He never fails at surprising us at every turn of the movie, and of course given us his classic cameo moment. This movie is so impressive because of how early he made it. This was one of his first major hits, and one of his best. While I still prefer Dial M for Murder and Rear Window as his best Mystery films, this one doesn't disappoint.Hitchcock, like several other great directors is always good at creating memorable characters, and this one has plenty. Particularly the housekeeper Mrs. Danvers. I think she is the character that I will remember for years to come and I'm glad she got an Oscar nomination that year. Another thing Hitchcock is known for is the twists and turns that the story and its characters take. There is always at least one big secret hidden away in the story. Secrets that us as viewers seemingly believe our characters have no way out of, but somehow someway the story comes back around and changes our minds. Major props to the writing crew, though its based on a book, the writers did a great job making this story our own and not giving anything away until its revealed but also leaving enough clues to where the second viewing becomes that much cooler.My only complaint would have been the length of the film, it dragged at times which lessened my hype for the ending. But it didn't make the final product as surprising as it was. But I will say the man guarding the shed definitely made me suspect that there was something not being told to us. That final scene with the house being burnt down was quite a surprise and a huge bang for this movie to go out on.In what was a typical Hitchcock thriller, we got everything that makes goose bumps rise on our arms and all the memorable scenes that we have become familiar with in terms of a Hitchcock movie. As of now I would put this movie in the top 7 or 8 of Hitchcock movies, and that is most definitely praise.8.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hitchcock &amp; Selznick's Superb du Maurier Adaptation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Last night I dreamed I went to Manderlay again..." and so begins one of the most captivating films from Hollywood's golden era. A superb adaptation of Daphne du Maurier's best selling novel, "Rebecca" was Alfred Hitchcock's first American directorial assignment, although producer David O. Selznick's strong influence is evident. While lacking the color and historical spectacle of "Gone with the Wind," Selznick's follow-up to his 1939 blockbuster shares lush production values, a thickly romantic atmosphere, and flawless performances with its illustrious predecessor. Both classics were adapted from popular novels, and both won Academy Awards for Best Picture.Du Maurier's well known mystery centers on a never-seen, but exquisitely beautiful and admired woman, Rebecca, who dies tragically before the story begins; however, she casts a dark shadow over her husband, his young second wife, and Manderlay, a stately seaside estate in Cornwall. The mystery-romance unfolds before George Barnes's Oscar-winning camera work, which emphasizes velvety blacks, window-cast shadows, and rainy reflections on a grandfather clock. Franz Waxman's lush score weaves its own web throughout the film with an appropriate mix of romantic themes and suspense.In front of the camera, Hitchcock drew memorable performances throughout. Sporting a mustache and a touch of grey, Laurence Olivier embodies the handsome Cornish aristocrat, Maxim de Winter; smooth, cultured, refined, and harboring a dark secret. With a voice born for sarcasm, George Sanders steals his scenes in a snide, cunning performance as Rebecca's "favorite" cousin. Mrs. Danvers ranks among cinema's most beloved villains, and Judith Anderson is cold, impassive, and riveting. Also called "Danny" in a sly allusion to her lesbian infatuation with the title character, Anderson excels in a restrained, yet hypnotic scene, where she fondles Rebecca's furs and caresses her lingerie; the actress says everything that the Production Code forbade about Danver's relationship with Rebecca. Florence Bates is another scene stealer as Mrs. Van Hopper, Joan Fontaine's employer; selfish, self absorbed, catty, and unforgettable. In support, Selznick sprinkled in such veterans as Gladys Cooper, Nigel Bruce, Reginald Denny, C. Aubrey Smith, and Leo G. Carroll to fill out an exceptional cast.Although easily overlooked among the bounty of rich performances and skilled thespians, Joan Fontaine's portrayal of the second Mrs. de Winter is exquisite throughout. Still in her early 20's, Fontaine's subtle growth from shy insecure travel companion, dominated by her overbearing employer, to self-assured supportive wife is masterful and never calls attention to itself; on a subsequent viewing, fans should focus on Fontaine throughout and marvel. While Fontaine grows as a woman, she also becomes closer to Olivier as the story unfolds; initially, Olivier kisses her chastely on the forehead, retains a distance between them, but, as the secrets spill, Olivier reaches out to her and, eventually, they kiss on the lips.Hitchcock's final image in "Rebecca" foreshadows that in "Citizen Kane." A silk pillow embroidered with an "R" is consumed by flames; a year later, Orson Welles ended his masterwork with a sled emblazoned "Rosebud" also engulfed in flames. Like the Welles classic, "Rebecca" is a timeless film that bears repetition. Despite familiarity with plot and ending, the film is like an old friend, and a return to Manderlay is always cozy, comfortable, and welcome.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"I am Mrs. de Winter now!"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is no way I couldn't review this. As a rule I don't have favorite films (because I can never pick) but let's be real, it's probably this one. I've seen Rebecca a good 10+ times and it never gets old. I feel obligated to talk about the book just a little (it's amazing read it), because there is a big difference. First of all, I'm so thankful that the nameless main character in the novel remains nameless in the film. The book is slightly more twisted, as Maxim intentionally kills Rebecca in the novel, which makes for a much more complex and slightly more intense plot. This obviously could not be carried out in a 1940s film, however. Although I wish they had.I really love the characters in this film. They make the whole story, and the idea of Rebecca is so strong it's like she's there as a fully formed character. Mrs. Danvers is the quintessential eerie housekeeper (who a lot of later figures are based off of), and her scenes with Mrs. de Winter are some of the best. It's obligatory that I mention the photography at this point, because it's really VERY nice. Especially the scene where Mrs. Danvers is trying to convince her to jump out the window. But I have to say, the thing that draws me to this film the most possibly is how much I relate to the main character. She reminds me so much of myself. Plus, people are always telling me that I look like Joan Fontaine, creepy. So, arguably the best Hitchcock film ever made?this movie is gold. Don't let me near the negative reviews, I might have a conniption.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Romance, Fear &amp; Dark Secrets</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In "Rebecca" a young woman's experiences of romance, fear and dark secrets correspond with her transition from innocence to maturity and prompt her saddened husband to reflect that "it's gone forever, that funny, young, lost look I loved won't ever come back. I killed that when I told you about Rebecca. It's gone. In a few hours, you've grown so much older". The despondency, regret and sense of loss that are embodied in these words are incredibly profound and typify the general atmosphere of gloom and melancholy that's such a strong and important feature of this extraordinary film.During a short stay in Monte Carlo, a na?ve young lady who works as a paid companion for a rich overbearing society woman meets and falls in love with an older aristocratic Englishman called Maxim de Winter (Laurence Olivier). Their relationship develops rapidly and soon the young lady becomes "the second Mrs de Winter" (Joan Fontaine) and returns with her new husband to his enormous estate in Cornwall and his huge mansion called "Manderley".Maxim is a moody widower whose first wife, Rebecca, died in a boating accident. He's often brusque with his wife and she assumes that his sudden outbursts of anger are linked to his inability to come to terms with the loss of Rebecca. When she becomes the new mistress of Manderley, the second Mrs de Winter is soon overwhelmed by her new role and starts to feel rather isolated because of the aloofness of her staff and her husband's rather distant manner. She's also surprised and intimidated by the degree to which the spectre of Rebecca seems to be ever-present as everyone in the mansion (including Maxim) seems obsessed with Rebecca.Mrs Danvers (Judith Anderson) is the cold, severe looking housekeeper who "adored" Rebecca and now keeps her room exactly as it was when her previous mistress was alive. Her hostility to the second Mrs de Winter is obvious from their first meeting and she does everything within her power to undermine her new mistress including trying to get her to commit suicide. The feelings of fear, inadequacy and powerlessness that the second Mrs de Winter experiences at this point are intense but soon everything changes when a sunken boat is discovered nearby with a body inside it. A whole series of revelations then follow and make it clear that so many things at Manderley were not as they had originally appeared to be.Laurence Olivier's performance as a tormented man who's haunted by his past is very good but definitely outshone by Joan Fontaine and Judith Anderson. Fontaine's expressions and body language convey her character's timidity, uncertainty and sincerity with enormous power and Judith Anderson is convincingly evil as one of movie history's most memorable villains.An interesting feature of "Rebecca" is the techniques that are used to make the second Mrs de Winter appear insignificant and inferior. Not only does she get cruelly dominated by her employer in Monte Carlo and consistently patronised by Maxim but she's also denied even the basic dignity of having a name. When she's first introduced to the staff at Manderley, she's made to feel uncomfortable and embarrassed because she's rain-soaked and dishevelled and visually, the distorted dimensions of the interiors of Manderley make her look physically smaller, lost and out of her depth in her impressive new surroundings.Although Alfred Hitchcock famously dismissed "Rebecca" as not being a "Hitchcock film", it's an exceptionally good film that's very well directed with numerous touches that are characteristic of the great director's work.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mrs. Danvers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Notice: This may (perhaps to some extent) contain a spoiler, but then again, who wouldn't be familiar with a motion picture seventy years of age?Here is another way to analyze the role of Mrs. Danvers. Notice that Mrs. Danvers didn't decide to end it all until after the image of Rebecca was publicly shattered. Otherwise, one full year after the demise of Rebecca, Mrs. Danvers was still going strong. Thus, the definitive icon for Mrs. Danvers could have been the concept of British Royalty itself; and there are some in England even today who still see things that way.Next, notice that at first, Mrs. Danvers did hope to somehow mold Joan Fontaine into this iconic stature. Moreover, Mrs. Danvers always had to know about Jack Favell and the cottage, and also the rented flat in London; and so it wasn't until, in effect, Jack Favell told "Danny" on the telephone about the suddenly destroyed image of Rebecca, reflecting perhaps even against the seemingly nicety nicety image of British Royalty itself, that the end then came for Mrs. Danvers.Continuing, here is more on the role of Mrs. Danvers. One can ask, why did Max de Winter allow Mrs. Danvers to continue maintaining what amounted to the shrine room of Rebecca for a number of months after the passing away of Rebecca, considering what emerged at the end of the movie? One reason could be that Mrs. Danvers the housekeeper did rule the rather large staff of Manderley for some years with a virtual whip, and Max de Winter evidently wasn't in the mood for interviewing for a new one.Even more to the point, Max de Winter obviously didn't want to do anything that might tarnish the image of Rebecca. In other words, no one was to know about his final encounter with Rebecca. Thus, for their respectively different reasons, both Max de Winter and Mrs. Danvers had the same objective of keeping the shrine room intact.Wait, there is still more. At the end, Joan Fontaine tells Max de Winter that Mrs. Danvers didn't want them to be happy at Manderley. However, that was well before the telephone call of Jack Favell, and shortly after Joan Fontaine actually ordered Mrs. Danvers to dismantle the shrine room. Enough said. Now, if you have read all of this, go see the movie, if you have not done so already.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Superb Hitchcock tale</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before getting to the meat of the movie, I want to comment about the quality of the recent Blu Ray edition. This is a very crisp and clear rendition, well worth the update from DVD.I want to begin by giving praise to 2 of the supporting actors here. The standout is Judith Anderson (later Dame Judith Anderson). Without her, this film really wouldn't have worked anywhere near as well. She brought life to one of the most truly spooky characters you'll see in almost any movie. Also deserving of great praise is Florence Bates -- here the stuffy dowager who keeps making a fool of herself. It was Bates' first movie role, and although she is only in the opening scenes of the film, she is quite memorable. However, I prefer her in later roles where a little comedy was woven into a rather steady characterization.If you buy the DVD with the "making of" extra, do watch it. It will give you an excellent overview of the struggles that went on between produced David O. Selznick and director Alfred Hitchcock. Mentioned at one point is the question of lesbianism on the part of the character played by Anderson. PERHAPS, but I think the documentary was wrong...that the target was wife # 1, not Joan Fontaine's wife # 2.While this is not my favorite Hitchcock film, it's right up there with such films as "Suspicion", "Shadow Of A Doubt", and "Spellbound". I'll give it ONLY an A, not an A+ that I would give such films as "North By Northwest" and "Vertigo". However, I think it is so much better a film than "Wuthering Heights", which I happened to watch just a few days before viewing this film, again.Laurence Olivier is excellent here. He plays the balance very well between the adoring husband of the new Mrs. de Winter who can't quite break free of the deceased first Mrs. de Winter (or can he?). He also plays a man who is still in turmoil from...from what?However, there is no question that this film belongs to Joan Fontaine. I was not much of a fan of Fontaine, but this film increased my esteem for her a great deal, particularly because she plays against her own type. Watch any old interview with her; she was always ACTING extremely refined; here she is playing a very awkward new wife. It may be her best film...either that or "Suspicion". But what is delicious about her performance here is how this beautiful woman manages to make herself seem so very plain for much of this movie. Plain, and yet refreshingly attractive.The other scene-stealer here is George Sanders...but then again, he always was a roguish scene-stealer! You'll also enjoy short performances by Nigel Bruce, Reginald Denny, C. Aubrey Smith, Gladys Cooper, and Leo G. Carroll.I think one of the best scenes in this, or any other film is the sequence when the evil servant helps Fontaine prepare for a costume ball in a costume she knows will remind Olivier of his first wife.The film is a bit over 2 hours, but worth every minute of your time. I rarely give an "8" for a film, but I will for this excellent Hitchcock effort. Savor it and put it on your DVD shelf!</fullReview>

But everybody says that sort of thing. What I want to add to the mix is that this is a film in which one of the major players (if not THE major player) never appears and in fact is dead. Who could pull that off any better than Hitchcock? I read somewhere that somebody (Selznick?) wanted a flashback during De Winter's 'confession' in the boathouse -- a flashback showing the events of that fateful evening -- but Hitchcock had the good sense to leave Rebecca unseen and dead -- the flashback would make her a 'real person' and ruin the whole effect.

		<shortDescription>A Gothic Hollywood romance in the hands of a master</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Both a Golden Age Gothic romance and a true Hitchcock thriller, "Rebecca" somehow merges its director's style with its producer's sensibility. Much has been made about the butting of heads between Alfred Hitchcock and famed Hollywood producer David O. Selznick, but "Rebecca" ends up feeling like a Hitchcock picture with the sweeping feel of a Hollywood film.Despite being Hitchcock's first experience working with Hollywood and Selznick's reputation for controlling his projects and making literal book adaptations (this being of Daphne Du Maurier's novel), the best parts of the film have Hitchcock's thumbprint on them. He infuses the story with total suspense and discomfort, refusing to let it bore for long in spite of its length.The story follows a Gothic romance storytelling model akin to the Bronte sisters, which explains why star Joan Fontaine won the lead in "Jane Eyre" opposite Orson Welles just a few years later. Hitchcock channels nearly everything through Fontaine's performance as the aptly unnamed main character, a personal assistant who on a whim during her stay in Monte Carlo meets and marries a wealthy widower (Laurence Olivier). Fontaine exudes a lovable naivete, one that starts out earning sympathy but twists into an attribute that antagonizes the audience as the film goes on as the presence of the late great first Mrs. De Winter, Rebecca grows more powerful.The role of Rebecca easily ranks as the most powerful character in cinema to never appear on screen. Hitchcock sees to it that her presence not only fills the mansion that already overwhelms the new Mrs. De Winter, but also consumes the film itself. She's felt both on camera and in the audiences mind, enough so that when Hitchcock pretends that she's really there by "following her" with the camera in a key scene late in the film where Maxim recalls the night she died, you honestly believe it and picture her as some terrifying figure. But there's no depreciating the characters on screen. Fontaine as she writhes about in mentally anguish does manifest everything a bit too physically, but the reaction she creates in the audience is a palpable paranoia and fear. Olivier portrays a man quick to anger but clearly for deep-seated reasons that come from a dark place. Then there's Mrs. Danvers, the woman who runs the house. The moment Judith Anderson walks on screen she enters your mind. A good comparison would be Margaret Hamilton as the Wicked Witch in "The Wizard of Oz." It helps that Mrs. Danvers also serves as an antagonist, but in an entirely different way. We connect with our unnamed heroine's fear of Mrs. Danvers, but not simply because she plays the creepy housekeeper, but as we come to know her and understand her connection to the late Rebecca, she becomes this psychologically complex individual. Although Hitchcock's directorial voice runs through Fontaine, Anderson adds punctuation to his efforts, especially as she steals the final moments of the film.Although the Academy of Motion Picture Arts &amp; Sciences would have you believe "Rebecca" to be Hitchcock's finest effort, it merely showcases his ability as an artist to overcome what was a producer-driven Hollywood at the time. Despite David O. Selznick's name appearing before the title card, Selznick will always be better remembered for "Gone with the Wind.' "Rebecca" ? that was Hitchcock's work.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hitchcock goes to Hollywood</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alfred Hitchcock's Hollywood debut, while not likely to appeal to the same fans who champion 'Vertigo' or 'Psycho', is nevertheless a 14-karat treasure from the Golden Age of movie-making. Purists will argue that the film is more Selznick than Hitchcock: a blockbuster studio production packed with talent, prestige, and all the glamour money can buy, but certain touches (mostly those concerning malevolent maidservant Judith Anderson and smarmy playboy George Sanders) could not have been duplicated by any other director. The film today, restored to all its magnificent, pristine clarity, is suitably lush and moody, and after all these years the atmosphere of unease surrounding the stately house of Manderley is still palpable. But the Daphne Du Maurier scenario is still very much an anachronism: the innocent, unsophisticated girl who marries into wealth and tries, desperately, to conform to society's manners is hardly a valid role model these days. And once the mystery of the late Rebecca de Winter is finally solved, the Gothic plot settles into a conventional blackmail scheme more typical of the Master of Suspense.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"I've loved you, my darling. I shall always love you, but I've known all along that Rebecca would win in the end."Rebecca begins very simply, with only the slightest hints of the twists and turns to come. After a whirlwind romance in the South of France, a young woman (Joan Fontaine in a nameless role) is swept off to Manderly, the lavish ancestral home of her new husband, Maxim (Laurence Olivier). It doesn't take her long after arriving there to find out that the shadow of Rebecca, Maxim's deceased first wife, continues to hang over Manderly.&nbsp;The stress of constantly being compared to the memory of the seemingly perfect Rebecca begins to outright suffocate the young wife, and her husband's frequent outbursts of temper and preoccupation combined with the unfavorable opinions of some of the household staff becomes more and more overwhelming. All is not as it seems in Manderly, however, and hidden secrets are eventually brought to light, with life-changing consequences.&nbsp;I thought Rebecca was a great movie. It initially seemed to be a light romance, before seamlessly bringing in elements of mystery and even courtroom drama. It's actually a relatively dark story, full of sordid dealings and shady characters. &nbsp;Quite a surprise or two is sprung on the audience before Rebecca is done, and while this doesn't seem much like a Hitchcock movie in the beginning, by the end, there is little doubt that his fingerprints are all over this. I highly recommend it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Chick Flick "Vertigo"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nearly 20 years before "Vertigo", Alfred Hitchcock made another film featuring romantic atmosphere, social misfits, a possible ghost, and male-female frustration. Except in "Rebecca's" case, it was from the woman's point of view."Rebecca" features identity confusion as well, in this case pitting a woman without a face against another without a name. Joan Fontaine is the nameless one here, paid to keep a miserable battleaxe company until she is whisked away in Monte Carlo by rich, debonair Maxim de Winter (Laurence Olivier). It's a perfect fantasy except that the place he lives, Manderley, is a perfect nightmare."We're happy, aren't we?" the bride asks at one point. "Terribly happy!" The problem's the dead former Mrs. de Winter whose first name is the movie's title. Based on a best-selling novel by Daphne Du Maurier, Rebecca's malign spell is captured in the ornate but shadowy set decoration, a creepy Franz Waxman score, and the raven-like Mrs. Danvers (Judith Anderson), a maid who pops out of corners of the frame offering unwanted advice on how "the late Mrs. de Winter" would have wanted things.Beaky, unblinking Mrs. Danvers is one reason guys might find this film frustrating. If she's so nasty, just send her packing, right? But Mrs. D works for me because of the heroine's trembly manner. Fontaine wears her character's insecurity very well. She wants to be on Mrs. Danvers' good side, which only mines "Danny's" contempt. Still devoted to Rebecca, a spellbinding force for whom "love was a game", Mrs. Danvers's perverse loyalty prompts a jealous cruelty. In "The Shining", we learn that people leave traces of themselves in strange buildings after they're gone, like "if someone burns toast". In "Rebecca", Mrs. Danvers IS the burned toast.Olivier is a bit of a stiff here, though it suits the part. It's a woman's-eye story all the way, with a real tough-love male to draw out his lover's unquenchable spirit. He wins her over to him with such lines as "I should have asked you to have had lunch with me even if you hadn't upset the vase so clumsily" and "I'm asking you to marry me, you little fool". He probably sent her out for Chinese food on their honeymoon, too.The movie moves very slowly, stringing out every hurt emotion. Because Rebecca was lost at sea, Fontaine has to blurt out at one point irrespective of nothing: "I never have any fear of drowning, have you?" cuing a musical sting. Around Maxim, there are lots of stings. "I'm boorish through living alone", he says, but of course that only makes the heroine's devotion more grand. Like Mrs. Danvers, she loves fully, but not at all well.Still, "Rebecca" is a solid romantic film with recognizable bits of Hitchcockian suspense worked in the corners. It's his first and most successful collaboration with David O. Selznick (a nudge who this one time was right to nudge), his first American film, and his only Oscar winner.I can think of several other Hitchcock films deserving of Oscar over "Rebecca". But it's better than no Oscars for Hollywood's greatest director. Looking past that, "Rebecca" is a solid, character-driven story worth watching and appreciating for its own substantial merits.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Alfred Hitchcock Puts Hollywood on Edge</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What else can you say about Alfred Hitchcock's "Rebecca"? It's still a startling production. Most obviously, it's one of the most perfect "Gothic" dramas produced; making a very steady transformation from Daphne du Maurier novel to film, it gives the genre refreshing celluloid life. Mr. Hitchcock directs star Joan Fontaine (as Mrs. De Winter) to the top of her profession; her guilty, frightened performance is a model for the reluctant Gothic heroine. Mysterious Laurence Olivier (as Maxim De Winter) and the supporting cast are perfect; with sinister Judith Anderson (as Mrs. Danvers) raising her character to striking icon status. Ms. Anderson's excessive fondness for "Rebecca", and the understated perverseness of sexuality between Mr. Olivier and both Mrs. De Winters, gives the film a edginess not permitted at the time. And, it was all enhanced by Hitchcock's expressive direction of George Barnes' camera. Haunting. ********** Rebecca (3/27/40) Alfred Hitchcock ~ Joan Fontaine, Laurence Olivier, Judith Anderson, George Sanders</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a producer/director combination that works, elegantly and to the best of abilities</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>David O. Selznick might have had more of an influence over this production than some might think- as with many of his films- and he is the one who ended up receiving the Oscar, not director Alfred Hitchcok, for the 1940 mystery-drama-romance Rebecca. But it is to the credit of both that, for the most part, it looks as if both tried to stay out of each other's way and just put up as good as film as they could. And it is a credit to Hitchcock that with a certain change from what one might see in his perhaps more entertaining films of the 50's and 60's also shows his knack at making great romantic Hollywood movie-making. He is given a plethora of the best of English acting talents (Olivier of course is hyped and hyped again just like Brando, but his work is undeniably good here, and yet it's Joan Fontaine who quietly makes her mark quite powerfully even when she is reserved in scenes), lush sets and production decor, a solid 'studio' score by Frank Waxman, and some memorable sequences and set-pieces. There is also some solid storytelling as well with his usual knack at unraveling a mystery piece by piece, with love, loss and deception at the core.Part of the film's success, however, is as attributable to the factor of it being one of the best "chick-flicks" in history that the film works today. And this time I mean it pretty much as a compliment, perhaps more to Selznick than anyone (Gone with the Wind, of course). The appeal that might usually go mostly for women is not lost at all on the male audience due to the sheer power and hints at what the two main actresses go for. Fontaine is the "2nd" Mrs. De Winter, who elopes with the Mr. played by Olivier and goes to live in Manderlay and meets some of the family and other folks. One of these is the one who has maybe the most interesting (naturally, as the antagonist) character, Mrs. Danvers played by Judith Anderson. Her's is a cold, exacting kind of character who has the straightforward, stern attitude of the ma'am of the house, but also with some dark secrets. It's not to say Hitchcock doesn't hav his eye out for other supporting parts and characters (I liked particularly the old guy who's at the shack where the majority of the secrets are house). But he also is able to get the character the audience will dislike the most as the more fascinating of the bunch, and Anderson is up to task.I wouldn't rush to see this as the first Hithcock film to see if you haven't seen one yet, but as an example of what he could direct aside from his outrageous and masterpiece works in the following years this is a fit example. It's also got, basically, an excellent story, and is pumped up with the best of Hollywood decorum and spectacle, with a big fire of an ending that practically on its own makes it worthwhile enough to see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What other word can describe such a piece of art? The Selznick/Hitchcock team may have been very strained relation-wise, but it proved to turn out one heck of a motion picture. The photography is awesome. The shadows cast all over Manderley are beautiful. The performances are dead-on. Joan Fontaine deserved the Oscar, but Judith Anderson is the best here. She never misses a note as the sinister Mrs. Danvers.The basic summary is this: Maxim de Winter (Laurence Olivier) takes his second wife (Fontaine) back to his large estate Manderley, where his bride is terrorized by memories of Maxim's first wife, Rebecca.There is no other movie that can compare. A perfect 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>American Gothic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hitchcock's first American movie, a word, American that is, that should be put in quotes because as Hitchcock pointed out, all of the cast and almost all of the crew were British. The film has already garnered so many comments that I'll avoid repeating most of them. The plot I'm sure has been thoroughly outlined and professionally analyzed but a few points are worth emphasis.The plot of very precisely structured. It consists basically of a man who is the dream of many women in the 1940s audience: ruggedly handsome, intelligent, keen witted, a bit commanding but not too much, fabulously wealthy, a touch roguish, and mysterious. It's the mystery that provides the plot engine. Every incident of his past emotional life needs to be pried out of Maxim deWinter (what a name, suggesting frigidity and distance) as if it were an abcessed tooth. Each secret, as he reveals it, is a surprise to his wife. Except for the final secret uncovered in the plot, which surprises everybody. Maxim could clear the whole mystery up with an hour's worth of private conversation with his wife. But of course he doesn't, or else there would be no story. That's why Hamlet takes so long to slaughter Claudius. And why the Indians don't shoot the horses as they're chasing the stagecoach.The acting. Olivier is extremely good at impersonating deWinter with all his charm and challenge. George Sanders is the best cad that the movies ever produced, and he proves it again here. Mrs. Danvers has a face and an expression that looks like an ice sculpture. The implicit lesbianism in her character of course had to remain implicit, but it is still rather a shock when she tenderly unfolds Mrs. DeWinter's nightie and says smoothly, "Look, you can see my hand through it." As for Joan Fontaine, a friend in Ireland said of her performance, "She does the shivering wife very well." Precisely put. With her delicate bone structure, fragile looking limbs, and her overall ikabani flower arrangement appearance, her wide asymmetrical eyes, with one brow arching up over her pale forehead, she looks about to faint with fright through half the movie. The only thing coarse about her is her wardrobe: bulky knit sweaters over her girlish bosom, long flapping drab skirts over her small but saucy rump, and those clodhoppers she wears while clunking about the house. She does the shivering naif in at least two other films of the period -- Hitchcock's "Suspicion" and "Jane Eyre." In fact, rummaging through the disarranged attic that is my long-term memory, I can't really remember her "doing" any other role.It's the closest Hitchcock ever came to making what was then called "a woman's picture." It received a "best picture" Oscar, which went to Selznick. Something Hitchcock seemed to resent for the remainder of his life. It was a commercial and critical success and it deserved to be.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An excellent mystery movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Out of all of the movies of Hollywood's Golden Age, "Rebecca" is certainly one of the best. It's an excellent mystery movie! Everything about this movie shines, beginning with the story itself. I really liked the story, in which the title character is a dead woman whose "presence" still lingers in many ways. The plot takes quite an unexpected turn near the end of the movie, when a shocking revelation is made. This revelation has a significant effect on the main characters. Speaking of characters, the performances of all the actors are outstanding. I loved Joan Fontaine's performance in this movie. It is one of the greatest female performances. What I liked about her performance most is that she plays a very shy woman. That's not something you see very often in movies. Fontaine plays her character with a lot of realism. She gets married to a wealthy widower, without having any knowledge of the lifestyle that awaits her. You can't help but be moved by her character's innocence and her desire to do the "right" thing, despite her timidness. You can understand the reasons for her character's confusion in being "the second wife", and her feelings of isolation when she is inevitably compared to the late Rebecca. Another really good performance is that of Judith Anderson as the sinister housekeeper, Mrs. Danvers. I especially liked the bedroom window scene where Anderson is telling the depressed Fontaine what she ought to do with her life. I love the expression on Fontaine's face in that scene. Also, Laurence Olivier gives a great performance as the husband, who has ambivalent feelings toward Fontaine. Furthermore, the sets were amazing. As a mystery movie and as a movie in general, "Rebecca" is excellent in every way. **** out of ****.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Marvelous, if not quite faithful, adaptation of du Maurier's thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This black and white classic is generally a wonderful adaptation of Daphne du Maurier's novel, and despite a number of liberties taken, I compliment Hitchcock on this brilliant thriller. The story revolves around a shy young woman who, having no family herself, is forced to serve as a paid companion to an obnoxious socialite named Mrs. Van Hopper, vacationing in Monte Carlo. While there, she meets a handsome but abrupt English widower named Maxim de Winter, who is staying at the same hotel and escorts her about. The innocent young woman is swept away by this mature and mysterious man, though she dares not reveal her emotions, given her lowly social position. Though there is strangely little romance involved, Maxim unexpectedly proposes marriage. The two wed and honeymoon abroad, then Maxim brings his bride home to his grand English country estate, Manderley. At Manderley the insecure, nameless second Mrs. de Winter is emotionally haunted by Maxim's first wife, the beautiful and accomplished Rebecca. Though Rebecca drowned many months earlier in a boating accident, her memory seems all too fresh in the minds of Maxim's sister Beatrice, his servants, and indeed Maxim himself. The haunting R's are everywhere...on the table linens, the lacy handkerchief, the address book, the dressing gown case. We never see so much as a photograph of the mysterious Rebecca, but her lingering presence is felt through both her possessions and the recollections of others. The domineering and foreboding housekeeper, Mrs. Danvers, was personally devoted to Rebecca and exhibits unconcealed disdain for the new intruding and inadequate mistress of Manderley. When Danny shows Maxim's new bride the bizarre West Wing shrine she keeps to her former mistress, it seems as though Rebecca herself might walk in at any moment and use the nightgown and hairbrushes meticulously laid out for her.For me, the quality of any adaptation of this novel depends upon the persona of the second Mrs. de Winter. Joan Fontaine is sympathetic and endearing in the role, suitably shy and bewildered, but this actress is far too pretty! Maxim's new bride should be unglamorous, even plain and dowdy. Primarily for this reason, I prefer the 1979 serial version which has a perfectly cast Mrs. de Winter. However, Laurence Olivier is superb as the mature, sophisticated, often brooding, and occasionally rather nasty Maxim de Winter. The most masterful performance is definitely given by Judith Anderson as the dark, sinister, and menacing housekeeper, Mrs. Danvers, whose chilling stare dominates much of the tale.Maxim's business agent and friend, Frank Crawley, is faithfully portrayed as a quiet, kind, and competent individual who is unfailingly loyal to Maxim. Beatrice is suitably forthright, Giles foolish and chubby, the servants appropriately formal, and Jack Favell utterly despicable. Mrs. Van Hopper is wonderfully captured as the rude, chattering, condescending, and altogether obnoxious socialite of the novel, fawning over the aristocracy. Her character is necessary in order to cement sympathy for her paid companion and her social situation. I found the Monte Carlo scenes well presented, though could hardly picture du Maurier's gauche heroine so comfortably at ease dancing with Maxim.The sets especially are brilliantly done, depicting Maxim's grand English country manor. I felt that I was literally standing in Manderley's grand hall with its incredible staircase. Library, morning room, dining room, upstairs galleries, Rebecca's bedroom, and boathouse are all perfectly captured. The Cornish coastal scenes with the haunting fog enshrouded sea are portrayed in typical eerie Hitchcock fashion. Even Jasper the spaniel is perfect!*** WARNING: MAJOR SPOILERS *** According to the Hays Code, no movie could depict a murderer in a sympathetic light so the screenwriters were forced to cast Rebecca's death as an accident. Fortunately, I was aware of this in advance so managed the altered portrayal of events quite well. However, it certainly changed the flavour of this sinister tale. As appealing as the dewy eyed Joan Fontaine is, Hitchcock falls short in capturing Mrs. de Winter. He changes completely her role in the Manderley costume ball preparations by indicating that SHE herself is taking charge. In the book, Mrs. de Winter feels utterly inadequate and useless in these preparations as the domineering Mrs. Danvers organizes menus, flowers, music, and invitations. The worst outrage is his failure to depict the complete transformation of this awkward, insecure young woman, initially so ill at ease as mistress of Manderley and timid with the servants. Once she is assured of Maxim's love and no longer haunted by Rebecca, the novel's Mrs. de Winter immediately becomes a confident lady of the manor, scolding a maid and even taking on Mrs. Danvers. Yes, there IS one movie scene where she DOES defy the housekeeper, declaring, 'I am Mrs. de Winter now'. However, it's ALL WRONG, defeating its purpose by occurring BEFORE Maxim reveals the truth. Hitchcock is certainly a master of the thriller but totally missed the point here. The ball scenes are shortened due to time constraints, some of the later settings altered, and liberties taken with the conclusion. The novel's Mrs. de Winter is driving home from London with Maxim, rather than remaining behind at Manderley during the fire. The lovey dovey embrace with the implied 'happily ever after' ending is unfaithful to the book. Neither at the beginning nor elsewhere is the viewer ever informed that the de Winters are currently living abroad in obscure hotels on the Continent in self imposed exile. However, for those less concerned with accuracy to the novel, this movie is a haunting and engrossing romantic thriller with an extremely sympathetic heroine.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In Monte Carlo, the shy and naive lady's companion (Joan Fontaine) of the snobbish Mrs. Edythe Van Hopper (Florence Bates) meets the wealthy widower aristocrat Maxim de Winter (Laurence Olivier) in the hotel while her employer is ill. They spend many days together and they fall in love for each other. When the youth is ready to travel to New York with Mrs. Van Hopper, Maxim proposes her and they get married to each other. The now Mrs. de Winter discovers that Maxim is disturbed with the loss of his first wife Rebecca, who died when her boat sank with her alone nearby his manor Manderlay. They travel to Manderlay, where Mrs. De Winter has a cold reception from the housekeeper, Mrs. Danvers (Judith Anderson), who worshiped Rebecca. Along the days, the humble Mrs. de Winter is frightened by the omnipresence of perfect Rebecca through the arrogant Mrs. Danvers. However, when the boat of Rebecca is found with her body trapped in the cabin, Mr. and Mrs. de Winter are haunted by the past."Rebecca" is probably is one of the most famous movies of Alfred Hitchcock in his earlier career, with a suspenseful romance with many surprises and twists. The performance of the fragile Joan Fontaine is amazing with her innocent expression and clumsy attitudes in an aristocratic world that does not belong to her, a simple working class young woman. Inclusive her character does not even have a name. Laurence Olivier makes a couple without chemistry with Joan Fontaine, in the role of a millionaire with a shadow from the past. The introduction, with Joan Fontaine telling her dream, misguides the viewers and I expected a different fate for the lead couple. George Sanders is the perfect scumbag and Judith Anderson performs a creepy character that might be homosexual grieving a non-corresponded love with Rebecca. The cinematography in black-and-white is very beautiful but the DVD released by the Brazilian distributor Continental is not remastered. My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): "Rebecca, a Mulher Inesquecível" ("Rebecca, the Unforgettable Woman")</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Hidden</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I stick by my other Hitchcock comments, comments that have produced lots of negative responses.Hitchcock was a terrific craftsman who after many, many tries made two really superb movies. Movies that can be life-altering and changed the face of cinema. This is not one of them.Those two cast a light of genius on his other work that is undeserved. This film is often cited as a great example of how coherently he was able to weave all his skills. I agree, but only two are remarkable: Fontaine's performance in the first half where she shrinks in her new situation. And the use of the house. But the story is so dull and plodding it cripples the pleasure of a craftsmanlike film.The house is similar to many in other films. But already with this movie, Hitchcock has a camera that is curious. Hard to recognize how unusual that is today because such a stance is so common now, but the idea of having a camera come from non-human perspectives but with human behavior was unique to him.And he uses the building well. We get a hint of this in the opening sequence. There is a collection of absolutely dreadful shots of fog, and an equally dreadful narration by Fontaine, but then we are taken through the gates up the drive. In an ordinary film of the era, the gates would open or the camera would go through the space between the two halves.But this camera goes through a "solid" part of upper right gate. That effect was costly and we get the message early that this is about space. The pounding on the fog metaphor is blunter report of the same message.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I give this film a 7.5 on a 10 point scale. All of Hitch's films, though mostly good, have screenplays that are just unbelievable &amp; improbable to some degree and "Rebecca" is certainly no exception. Fontaine's character is S-O-O Weak, Na?ve, Passive, &amp; Fragile that it lacks credibility. NO Woman, even in pre-Feminist times, could possibly be as much of a Clueless Doormat as the new Mrs de Winter. That as the new mistress of Mandalay she would have kept that witch Mrs Danvers as the housekeeper is at least very unlikely, especially when Danvers tricked the new Mrs de Winter to wear that dress for the ball. The Mrs Danvers character was rather unreal too. She was much more a caricature than a believable character. Otherwise, a very suspenseful, &amp; well thought out storyline, with great dramatic tension, although the "dramatic" was much too "melodramatic" in my opinion. How a great director like Hitch got stuck with so many sub-par screenplays is beyond my comprehension.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A beautiful film very well directed, with very good acting, an excellent setting and decor, a very good screenplay, based on a very efficient story from the novel of the same name, 'Rebecca' is the real deal. This film is as much about story as atmosphere, and everything works in the way of the atmosphere transpiring evidently from this piece as one will surely keep at least some visual images and the overall feel from this film some time after viewing it. It's just about what one would expect of a Hitchock-directed picture rooted in a deep Gothic, dark romanticism. A few special mentions to Joan Fontaine who was arguably in her prime, absolutely gorgeous and attentive to play her role judiciously, as well as Olivier sometimes criticized who played his role of the constantly tormented, preoccupied but forgetting himself in the present moment male lead just right, and the actress portraying Mrs. Danvers who was simply exact with her performance.Excellent story.

		<fullReview>The ghost of the late Rebecca de Winter is a constant presence in the haunted halls of Manderley, although we are never graced with her physical presence or even a still picture of her supposed great beauty. Nevertheless she is talked up as the absolute paragon of womanhood and femininity; mature, sophisticated, the most beautiful creature you could ever lay your eyes on. Joan Fontaine plays the opposite quite well - the naive, tittering little girl who could never compare to the first Mrs de Winter (at least in the eyes of Mrs Danvers), and yet Maxim seems to fall for him anyway. In a funny way, the twist does make sense; most of the resentment is from Mrs Danvers herself, eyeing needles her way as she dons what Rebecca made stunning and keeps her former bedroom in pristine condition, like an obsessive shrine. Hitchcock begins with an eerie statement; the ghost dominating a dream where she returns to the fated Manderley and drifts right through the gates (a clever trick with the camera) as though nothing will stop her from seeing that no woman ever replaces herself. Later the happily married couple mimic the same entrance through the gates and up the driveway, in pouring rain (never a good omen), although the soundtrack is stirringly romantic and attempting to convince us that all is well. Beneath the ground level class and sheen Hitchcock utilises the great Gothic archways and ominous shadows well. Through the soundtrack, a pair of double doors seem to almost speak directly to Fontaine, enticing her to unveil their secret. She is blonde, of course, and wears white, whilst the housekeeper is robed in pure black and has a face that is constructed from ivory, still, unmoving and emotionless. She is like Nosferatu the vampire himself. Unfortunately what the twist does, effectively, is render this all rather fruitless. Initially the entire atmosphere of the troubled Manderley estate is fraught with second guessing on both Fontaine and the audience's part. The visuals, soundtrack and performance all fight to wrest control of the mood; they contradict each other, they try to drown each other out. It's all wonderfully tense because we are alongside Fontaine trying to make sense of the whole affair of Rebecca. But the twist makes it all unironic. Everything becomes played straight - Maxim is just a troubled gentlemen, and the romance becomes sappy and sentimental; see how they make eyes at each other during what should be a pivotal trial scene, and later as Hitchcock holds on their kiss and embrace. Still, it does make for some great moments, chiefly one where Maxim recounts the fateful night with Rebecca. The camera becomes one with his conscience here; it imagines Rebecca on the bed, it rises to meet her eye-level as she gets up, and you can almost visualise her strutting and sneering around the room with a cigarette as the camera swings around. But isn't the former much more frightening? From that moment on, the film loses all of its psychological mystery and appeal, and it is only a matter of time before the happy reconciliation of husband and second wife. Hitchcock would later perfect this with a little film called Vertigo.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can not help feeling that the hostility between the producer and director on the one hand and the main actors on the other hand resulted in such a unique and excellent film. REBECCA is a mystery drama with elements of Gothic style that captivates completely. The director deliberately provoked gloomy atmosphere on the set. Despite that the actors are perfectly done their job.The beginning of the film is reminiscent of a typical romance or "Cinderella" story in which a little bit of stink. After the wedding story becomes very anxious mystery with a strong dramaturgy and excellent acting. Set design is incredibly fit with the atmosphere. Emotion and cold alternating. Despite repeated plots this movie I would not describe as a thriller. Rebecca is a film about violence against relations and ties with the past. Voltage, typical in Hitchcock's creative work, there is more than just entering the Manderley, not wane even after the last scene.Joan Fontaine as the second Mrs. de Winter is a common companion and plain, simple girl who becomes the mistress of a huge estate and wife of a man of high lineage. It becomes Mrs. De Winter, but how to do it, when the first Mrs. de Winter still there? Fontaine probably had no idea how her mood affect the perfection of character. In Hollywood she entered through the front door.Laurence Olivier as Maxim de Winter, owner of Manderley is habitually cold and sharp. In the second part of the film his emotions rise to the surface. Olivier is certainly one of the few actors who make a small play in conflict with his own emotions.Perhaps the animosity was as good a reason of attraction between Olivier and Fontaine on the screen.Judith Anderson as Mrs. Danvers, housekeeper of Manderley is the perfect villain for this opportunity. The terrifying stillness, cold look, lack of emotion, facial expression that suggests hatred etc. Hitch is through this character touched two controversial topics psychological violence by women and lesbianism.The film is little you can complain about, one that nicely rounded whole, diverse genres, accompanied by fine music theme by Franz Waxman. With Laurence Olivier in the title role, a triple Oscar winner and founder of the British National Theatre, Hitchcock as a director and an intriguing storyline. Rebecca is absolutely brilliant film with shades of threatening the past, violent and tragic present and an uncertain future.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Alfred Hitchcock's latest cameo (in the movie)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I admit to being confused by the first twenty minutes or so of this film. This might be the last Alfred Hitchcock movie I ever saw as I've seen almost all his other well known films. It really is great to see this evolve into a movie truly worthy of his namesake! Almost all his films are horror or mystery or at least thriller. This is a film that definitely got better as it went along. It just got better and better atmosphere as it went on. You would think the main female character in this movie would be named Rebecca, right? Nope, that's actually her husband's deceased wife who never even appears.It's amazing to see how much is done in this movie. The husband shows off their home movies even though they just got married. It will make more sense as more is revealed about the story. I feel bad for not finding the Hitchcock cameo in this! It turns out you can barely see his face at all and I had to watch a supercut to make sure it was him. Yeah, I'm such a nerd and I have heard of people who watch his movies just to see his cameos. It's over two hours in, a record! The strange thing is that it begins with opening narration. It ends without any, so it's hard to tell if she's actually telling the story. It was certainly unpredictable, as expected from any of his movies. This may be one of his earliest films that's really consider one of the best of all time as it would be over ten years that "Psycho", "The Birds", "Vertigo", "North By Northwest", AND "Rear Window" would come out. It's always nice to see when an artist first becomes an expert! This is a must see for anyone. I personally don't find this as good as most of the movies that I just mentioned, but that's still a compliment for someone as good as him! Perfect ****.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rebecca, you b****!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film "Rebecca" is directed by the incomparable Alfred Hitchcock. starring Joan Fontain and Laurence Oliver. This is perhaps one of Hitchcock's if not Hitchcock's most glorious of film productions. It is loaded with all of the intriguing mysteries of life and love yet suspenseful and thrilling(no surprise coming from Hitchcock that is). There is a twist at every corner as we slowly discover who "Rebecca" truly is and the honest means of her death. watching this film is like following a deranged child through a maze. Its psychological twists are heavy but severely entertaining providing any audience with genuine shock.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great HORRIBLE movie or a HORRIBLE great movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The very nature of this kind of suspense drama is to lead the audience on, oftentimes with misdirection, or heightened atmospherics (an unblinking Mrs. Danvers). Of all Hitchcock movies I have seen, this one seemed to actively present Director Hitchcock as 'Deus ex machina'. The whole film seemed so contrived and fake; a story should develop 'suis generis' while this one seemed to develop by directorial disposition. In the end, to my way of thinking, it just seemed klunky. And unbelievable. For Hitchcock, the audience has to be conned into believing the events are plausible, the story line is plausible; and for many Hitchcock films, that can be a stretch. For me the worst moment came when Rebecca (Joan Fontaine) dresses as the first Rebecca for a masquerade ball at the suggestion of Mrs. Danvers. Rebecca ended up then, at that point, looking like an idiot; she always seemed not especially bright as a character--and that single decision made her seem downright stupid. Further, an inquest--long after the death of a person--was one more instance of directorial interpolation. And Rebecca, upon hearing that she is, in reality, manipulated into being the 2nd Mrs. Rebecca de Winters, would have acted appropriately in demanding answers from her new spouse; instead, she turns to Mrs. Danvers, who is intended to look and be something of psycho-zombie for confirmation of details. Again, turning to the demonic Mrs. Danvers makes Rebecca (Joan Fontaine) look borderline idiotic, especially given that Rebecca is portrayed in the film as being terrified of this psycho-zombie.To me, in the end, the movie just didn't work. I gave it 10 stars--because either way it is great as a horrible movie or horrible as a great movie; an exercise and insight into how not to make movies, especially from a Director who mastered this genre with such brilliance by making the barely plausible--seem possible.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Outstanding film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't have much to add to the overwhelmingly positive response to this film expressed on this site and elsewhere. 'Rebecca' combines a compelling story with excellent acting, masterful direction and haunting cinematography. The flow of the film, as it moves from almost light comedy (Florence Bates' over-the-top society-snob character) to romance to mystery to Gothic horror is a testimony to Hitchcock's skill as a director as well as the quality of the script and the talent of the cast. The climatic destruction of Mandalay and the immolation of Mrs. Danvers as she stands by her 'shrine' to Rebecca is one of Hollywood's most memorable scenes. I think that this is one of the finest films to come out of the 1940s as well as one of my personal favourites.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Magnificent Hitchcock Thriller in Hollywood's Golden Era</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Where can I start with this film?! It is a truly magnificent, perfectly cast (and of course, perfectly directed) mystery thriller in the golden era of film-making. Sir Laurence Olivier and Joan Fontaine, a duo of classic movie icons, star in REBECCA, a story of a naive young woman who marries a wealthy aristocrat that is haunted by the memory of his dead first wife, Rebecca.When it starts off as a romantic film, it shifts the tone to a dark and mysterious thriller, after we are introduced to Mrs. Davers, the intimidating housekeeper who is dangerously obsessed with Rebecca.There are many twists and turns in the plot, mainly Olivier's confession of drowning Rebecca's body in her boat after she accidentally hit her head and died when taunting him about the fact that she was pregnant with another man's child. The truth was she was sick and wanted to anger him into killing her so he can be prosecuted.The cast was brilliant and extremely convincing in the portrayal of their respective characters. The setting and photography were excellent as well.This film has helped Hitchcock into what he became some decades later, and it was wonderful to watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A sweet shy woman (Joan Fontaine) is staying at a Monte Carlo hotel assisting her employer pompous Edythe Van Hopper. She falls for the wealthy Maxim de Winter (Laurence Olivier) and they are quickly married. His first wife supposedly drowned. They live in his country estate Manderley with strict housekeeper Mrs. Danvers (Judith Anderson) and other servants. She discovers that Rebecca still dominates Manderley.It's Alfred Hitchcock's first American effort and working under Selznick. It is beautifully shot. Joan Fontaine does well as the damsel in distress. The style is moody Gothic. It is a bit slow at times. I would like it to be more intense and less overwrought. It's an old fashion style that isn't my favorite but it is very well made.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Albert Hitchcock creates yet another masterpiece. From the start, the cast is like a dream team. The acting was superb., though sometimes over dramatic, but that was common for the time. The music was also spectacular. It allowed for the mood to be set. Both soft and hard shadows were applied when they needed to be. The story was something different, someone being haunted by their husbands dead wife? Thats different even for todays horror type movies. The atmosphere created was brilliant, we know we couldn't see Rebecca, but she had a god like feel. She was always there, manipulating things as she pleased. A different story from the start was made amazing by the stellar actors and actresses involved in this film. Easily a must see for any horror buff</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hitchcock movies are known around the world for a reason, they're really good, acting wise, director wise, and cinematography wise. The whole story was acted out wonderfully by Olivier and Fontaine, Oliver played the mysterious handsome man well, and Fontaine was believable as a naive girl who fell for the looks. There were so many instances of great cinematography unique to Hitchcock films, playing with light and shadow to really tell the story along with the dialogue to make everything come together. Alfred Hitchcock as the director definitely left his mark on this movie, since I saw it was adapted from a book, and not created by him, he made it his own with great directive vision.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good, if you're not expecting a typical Hitchcock film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alfred Hitchcock was a brilliant English director know for his suspense films, so when Hollywood hired him, they did exactly what you'd expect; not have him direct a suspense movie. Of his first three Hollywood films, only one was suspense, with the others being a screwball comedy and the Gothic Rebecca.The first time I saw Rebecca I was disappointed precisely because I was expecting something typical of the man behind North By Northwest, The Lady Vanishes, and Psycho. But if you go in without expectations of a typical Hitchcock film, this is an entertaining movie with some very nice touches, such as a wondrous scene in which Hitchcock brilliantly uses the camera to bring Maximillian's description of a moment with Rebecca to life. The cast is good, particularly Judith Anderson as Danvers, and the film is handsomely mounted. It's not near Hitchcock's best, but it probably deserved to win an Oscar as much as any of the movies nominated that year (Sullivan's Travels, which came out the same year, should have won but wasn't nominated). It's a memorable movie well worth watching. Just don't expect much suspense.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This review doesn't have the story line or any spoilers. 'Rebecca' is a recommended classic for all ardent fans of Hitchcock movies. Not only the suspense gives us chills, the film has soothing love sequences between Laurence Oliver and Joan Fontaine. Joan as Mrs. de Winter steals the show with her innocent love over her husband. Judith Anderson's portrayal as Mrs. Denvers is one which should be noted. She simply stuns the audience with her dark brooding body language and the tone she speaks. The sequence involving her and Joan in the old Mrs.de Winters room speaks the work of Hitchcock. Great direction, beautiful sets of Manderley with lovely performances adds feather to the classic mystery. Overall it is a must watch where Entertainment joins hand with Classic touch ..!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've read this book about 16 years ago and wasn't aware of the movie. Was yearning to watch a good thriller on the book, because it is one of the most spine chilling stories of those times. The fact that this thriller is made by Alfred Hitchcock has made all the difference. Laurence Olivier and Joan Fontaine are absolutely credible as Mr and Mrs De Winter, and Judith Anderson is terrifying as Mrs Danvers. If you've read the book, you know the twist at the end. But if you haven't yet, the movie is a treat for you. Every frame is delectable and worthy. The suspense unfolds gradually and at the beginning you wouldn't even guess what's in store for you. There isn't much of outdoors explored, but the indoor set is splendidly built as the castle of Manderlay.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rebecca</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can see now why Alfred Hitchcock is such a well-respected and well known director. The movie, Rebecca, is about a young woman living in Monte Carlo with her mean employer. She met a very wealthy man by the name of Maxim de Winter. The two fall in love and move back to Maxim de Winter's large estate but it doesn't take long for his new wife to notice that the death of his first wife, Rebecca, still has an effect on everyone in the house. They all still miss her and it is obvious that they wanted the new wife to kind of take the place of Rebecca in a way that she just couldn't do. Rebecca had a huge effect on the housekeeper, Mrs. Danvers. She even set the house on fire at the end of the movie and ended up dying in the house. The movie had a very surprising ending which I liked. Hitchcock is a great director and you can see that through the movies lighting, camera-work, sounds, and editing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great hitchcock film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Out of all of the movies of Hollywood's Golden Age, "Rebecca" is certainly one of the best. It's an excellent mystery movie! Everything about this movie shines, beginning with the story itself. I really liked the story, in which the title character is a dead woman whose "presence" still lingers in many ways. The plot takes quite an unexpected turn near the end of the movie, when a shocking revelation is made. Hitchcock is known for twists and turns that the story and its characters take. There is always at least one big secret hidden away in the story. Secrets that us as viewers seemingly believe our characters have no way out of, but somehow someway the story comes back around and changes our minds. Hitchcock, like several other great directors is always good at creating memorable characters, and this one has plenty. Particularly the housekeeper Mrs. Danvers. She holds the craziest grudge over Rebecca as she enters her newly married life into the mansion. Although I personally found Rebecca's character to be of weak nature, it somehow brings out the cruelty in Mrs. Danvers, giving her an even larger ability to hate the girl. Overall this is an impressive and engaging film that tells a good story with a great approach, producing a dark and interesting film that is driven by an unseen character whether the tone is melodrama, romance or mystery story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mystery in the most out...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Rebecca" is a mystery movie in which we watch a shy woman who was working as a companion girl of another woman. In a trip she and one rich man fall in love and they decide to marry. When they are returning to the main house of the man she understands that he is still troubled by the death of his first wife, Rebecca, who was killed in a boating accident the year before. And in that the mystery starts.I really liked this movie because of the plot which was really nice written but also for the direction of it which made by the master Alfred Hitchcock and his contribution in the success of this movie was really obvious. We can understand in many scenes the tips and the guidance that Alfred Hitchcock gave to the actors on how to play, to show etc. About the interpretation I have to say that I loved the interpretation of Joan Fontaine who played as Mrs. de Winter and also the interpretation of Laurence Olivier who played as 'Maxim' de Winter. Another interpretation that has to be mentioned is Judith Anderson's who played as Mrs. Danvers and I believe that she was great on her part. Another important fact that I have to mention is that this movie did not tire me even a little and kept me in tense in the whole duration of it, something that I believe is extremely important for a mystery movie.Lastly I believe that "Rebecca" is a nice mystery movie which combines really well this mystery with the romance between the couple and the result that comes out from it is the best. I also think that this movie is one of the best of Alfred Hitchcock and I strongly recommend it to everyone because it's a must see movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The master of pulling the rug under you</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"You thought you could be Mrs. de Winter, live in her house, walk in her steps, take the things that were hers! But she's too strong for you. You can't fight her - no one ever got the better of her."Without ever being physically present or having a line in the film, Rebecca's strange influence over everyone dominates the film in a way only Hitchcock could have pulled off. I still have a lot of Hitchcock films to catch up with, but so far I haven't seen one I disliked. Rebecca is a near masterpiece and Hitchcock once again proves his craft as a director by slowly building a psychological romantic thriller and then once we are hooked with the characters he pulls the rug under our feet and delivers some surprising twists we never expected. This may not be one of Hitchcock's most popular films, but it will always be regarded for being the only film of his that won him an Oscar. Rebecca isn't his best film (which in my opinion is Rear Window), but it deserves to be ranked amongst his best work thanks to a gripping screenplay, some wonderful performances, memorable characters, and above all its beautiful black and white cinematography. It is simply stunning and despite being made in 1940 it still manages to remain incredibly suspenseful and unique. Despite knowing that Hitchcock is going to come up with an interesting twist he completely catches me off guard every time and leaves me even more engaged with his work. My only complaint (a minor one) with his films is that despite being subtle throughout the story at the end he spells everything out for the audience trying to explain the twists (Psycho is the best example of this, but in Rebecca it's done again and it makes the film drag a bit near the end, but it's only a minor complaint considering we are talking about the Master of Suspense). Rebecca is based on Daphne Du Maurier's celebrated novel (who also wrote The Birds which Hitchcock later went on to direct) and adapted by Robert E. Sherwood. The story centers on a shy unnamed woman (Joan Fontaine) who works as a paid companion to the wealthy Edythe Van Hooper (Florence Bates). While they are in Monte Carlo she meets a wealthy estate owner named Maxim de Winter (Laurence Olivier). Edythe mentions that Maxim's wife, Rebecca, passed away an year ago in a boating incident and he hasn't recovered from it. During their short stay in Monte Carlo however, Maxim falls in love with her and the two marry within weeks of having met. Maxim takes the new Mrs. de Winter to his beautiful country home known as Manderley and introduces her to the staff. Despite being in awe of the majestic home, she feels intimidated by the housekeeper, Mrs. Danvers (Judith Anderson), who remains obsessed with Rebecca. As the days pass, Mrs. de Winter begins to feel overwhelmed by everyone's affection towards Rebecca and somehow she feels that Maxim is still very much in love with her. Rebecca's shadow seems to interfere with everything she does and she begins to feel her relationship is doomed.Rebecca is not simply a psychological thriller centering on relationships, it is a film focusing on identity. Despite never being seen, Rebecca's presence dominates this film and she seems to have a strange effect over everyone. In contrast, the second Mrs. de Winter only gets her name once she marries Maxim and she never really has an identity of her own. She is continually threatened by Rebecca's presence no matter what she does and despite wanting to overcome it she can't because everyone seems to have adored her. Hitchcock builds the tension and suspense very subtly with memorable characters. Despite being extremely beautiful Joan Fontaine pulls off an incredibly natural and believable performance as this shy and insecure pet-girl. Laurence Oliver also plays his role as the loving but distant character very well. However the two most memorable performances for me came from the supporting cast. Judith Anderson and George Sanders play the villains to perfection. Sanders delivers some comedic relief, while Anderson's mysterious and cold face uneases us from the moment she appears on screen. The Gothic mood underlying the film mixes perfectly with the haunting ghost story as Rebecca's presence can be felt everywhere once we step into Manderley. Hitchcock has done it again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hitchcock waxing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rebecca is one of the transition films that took Hitchcock from his British period to his early US period. Joan Fontaine, who just died as I write this, really is someone to behold in this film. It is always amazing how Hitchcock starts with innocuous situation, like a young woman employed as company for an elderly lady, woven together with a chance encounter, and ends up with a tightening noose around his characters. He perfected this in Psycho, and in the late, lesser work Family Plot - which is still remarkable.As always, the suspense does not arise because the viewer is left in the dark about things the characters know. We discover the truth together with the main character, biting our knuckles.Judith Anderson deserves a special mention. Her contempt for Fontaine's character, the usurper of the dead Goddess she worshiped as head housekeeper, drips off the screen. In general, the acting by the female lead and her female antagonist is much stronger, the roles are much juicier, than the male lead (a very competent Olivier) and his antagonist. Hitchcock really was a woman's director, and it shows in this film.The sets are eerie, the costumes (by Edith Head? I don't recall for certain) perfect, even the letters that move the plot along are individualized in their handwriting.It's gorgeous to watch, and the ending satisfies, yet the details are so rich, it is worth seeing again after a few years. I was on viewing #3.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of Alfred Hitchcock's Timeless Classics</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the finest psychological thrillers of its or any other time, Rebecca is an expertly crafted Gothic tale by Alfred Hitchcock that tells the story of a woman who's constantly haunted by the presence &amp; reputation of her husband's first wife, Rebecca, when she moves to his large country estate and finds herself constantly in clash with the housekeeper, Mrs. Danvers, who was extremely fond of Rebecca.Engaging from its opening moments, the film takes the road of romance in its first act but soon turns into an extremely gripping suspense that even managed to touch the genre of horror with its carefully structured narration. Brilliantly directed by Hitchcock who maintains a remarkable control over each frame from start to finish, Rebecca is also aided by its tight screenplay, timeless cinematography, edgy editing &amp; terrific performances from its entire cast.The best part about this tale is the effortless manner in which it is able to immerse the viewers into its tense atmosphere of claustrophobia &amp; isolation with all the mysteries surrounding a dead woman and benefits greatly from strong performances by Joan Fontaine, Laurence Olivier &amp; especially Judith Anderson, who plays Mrs. Danvers with remarkable creepiness &amp; ends up impressing the most.On an overall scale, Rebecca is a significant example of film-noir and is one of Hitchcock's finest works behind the camera. The technical aspects are carried out amazingly well, the performances leave nothing to complain about and the creepy ambiance it is able to sustain throughout its runtime is something most thrillers don't even manage to come close to. An enduring classic that will probably never age, Rebecca comes highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gothic Atmosphere and Sophisticated Characters</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Charles Ramirez Berg, when discussing various landmarks of Hitchcock's films, pointed out that therein "evil manifests itself not only in acts of violence but also in the form of psychological, institutionalized and systematic cruelty." And it seems that REBECCA, his Hollywood directorial debut, a production that the New York Times reviewer Frank S. Nugent calls "facile and penetrating" proves that assumption specifically convincing. Though, this is a film which barely resembles the director's hallmarks nor reveals the cream of the Master of Suspense (actually lacking the MacGuffin).The screen adaptation of Daphne Du Marier's story "stands or falls on the ability of the book's 'I' to escape caricature" (Frank S. Nugent) but, simultaneously, "allows Hitchcock to mix styles and genres" (Berardinelli). His 'visual schemes' and 'thematic concerns' are present here, but the movie belongs to "somewhat uncharacteristic works" (R. Berg). It is, actually, REBECCA's Gothic atmosphere and sophisticated characters where its major strengths lie.(Gothic atmosphere) James Berardinelli observes in his review of the movie that "it is perhaps the height of irony that the only film directed by the Master of Suspense to win a Best Picture Oscar is a Gothic melodrama." Just the height of paradox where Hitchock proves to be a versatile director. There is no need to outline the story because each viewer will be led to its mechanisms, its thrill soon after the opening credits are over. Indeed, one could observe that its backbone is partly the novel, partly the resemblance to Bronte's JANE EYRE and partly today's soap opera but the whole decoration that it is covered with brings even skeptical viewers to certain awe. From the start, we see that moonlight can play tricks upon all of us (images heavily influenced by Hitchock's early encounter with German Expressionism at Ufa Studios). That highlights the magnificent job of the cinematographer George Barnes with the haunting use of light and shadow, the atmospheric score by Franz Waxman, the screenplay by Robert Sherwood, Philip Mac Donald, Michael Hogan, Joan Harrison and special effects by Jack Cosgrove. Considering the camera, F.S. Nugent rightly states that "cameras murmur 'Beware' when a black spaniel raises his head and lowers it between his paws again." Among many emblematic scenes of the movie, consider the discovery of Manderlay mansion or the couple's dance in the first phase of the film which is a typical old Hollywood romance. In all these aspects, REBECCA, as one of the most praised productions of the early 1940s, can be considered Hitchock's process of pursuing his style still under the spell of Expressionism but revealing something from the depth of his fertile fantasy.(Characters) Along with the very best performers of the time, F.S. Nugent observes something interesting in that respect. Mr Hitchcock, he says, "the famous soloist, suddenly recognized that, in this engagement, he is working with an all-star troupe." Yes, director's great rapport with the versatile cast results in outstanding performances and displays of great talents. Here, our attention is on Joan Fontaine. And to what extent the artistic side corresponds to the inner worlds of her character is mentioned by Berardinelli who states that "the director uses camera angles, editing, and music to emphasize the lead character's claustrophobia as it escalates to near hysteria." But before I outline certain points about Fontaine's performance, let me highlight another great achievement. It is not merely the great Olivier as the male co-star to Fontaine (one of Hitch's favorite blondes), it is not Sanders in the supporting role of Jack Favell, the scheming member of the extended family. The greatest role belongs to JUDITH ANDERSON as Mrs. Danvers, "considered by many literary critics to be among the best 20th century villainesses" (Berardinelli). A haunting character with homo-erotic overtones delivers unique psychological power, displays a Gothic idea of evil disguised by cold manners and indifferent gestures where still waters indeed run deep. In one scene, she introduces Fontaine to the room in the west wing that once belonged to late Rebecca and, magically almost, blends the real world with the imaginary world, spirits and living people, memories with here and now. Adding the narcissistic aspect of inner lusts and her hand placed on Rebecca's clothes delivers bizarre psychedelic experience. She appears to be a shadow incarnate, an incendiary 'persona' of the whole story bringing everything to haunting conclusion.(Fontaine, Olivier) The chemistry between Fontaine and Olivier appears to be striking. The actress who played in some other Hitchock's films being a co-star to Cary Grant in SUSPICION handles the role with sophisticated charm, certain psychological distance, some youthful enthusiasm. Yes, so far together with Larry. Alone, however, her role is hard, very hard as "a second Mrs. De Winter" a character placed totally in the shadow of her deceased predecessor, caged within the burden of haunting past ruled by 'the most beautiful creature people ever saw', she has no one to rely on once she enters the mansion and much must be expressed in her facial gestures. Slowly, she explores fears, even psychological angst no less than Bergman in Rossellini's masterpiece. From the inside out, she gives a silent performance to a significant extent. Berardinelli states that she "emphasizes her inferiority to Rebecca." Relying on that notion, we could ask ourselves: what about the superior character to her? All we know is that she was beautiful but incapable of love, some model of 'cold Aphrodite' developed even more intensely in a German film ALRAUNE. 'What was Rebecca really like?' remains a rhetorical question and something that is left to us just to imagine...Maxim De Winter is, to the contrary, a tormented character, a man of good will placed in the wrong place at a wrong time. Quite underrated at certain moments, this is, undeniably, one of Olivier's towering performances.REBECCA is a gem, a highly recommended film which may enhance the Hitchock's reputation as a versatile director and a surprising work where atmosphere and characters still supply us with unique entertainment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Job Building This By Alfred Hitchcock</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The secret to truly appreciating this movie is to get through the first hour or so of it. To be frank, that first hour is less than riveting. We find ourselves following the romance and the early part of the marriage of the wealthy and lonely widower Maxim de Winter (Laurence Olivier) to his new young bride (Joan Fontaine.) There really isn't much meat to this part of the story. It's a bit of a rich meets poor love story, as the young bride finds herself in a romance with this man who was quite above her socially, and it's even got a bit of humour to it, as we watch the young woman's employer Mrs. Van Hopper (Florence Bates) try to ingratiate herself with Maxim. It's a pleasant enough (although not exactly engrossing) love story for a while, and after their return to Maxim's Manderlay estate it still seems to be little more than the challenge of the new Mrs. de Winter (whom I don't remember being named) to overcome the reluctance of the servants - and especially Mrs. Danvers (Judith Anderson) - to accept her, since they appear to have been fiercely devoted to the late Mrs. de Winter (whose name was Rebecca.) Yes, Mrs. Danvers is an unusual, and therefore suspicious, character who has more than a bit of mystery about her, but still this really doesn't seem to be going anywhere very fast.Once we're through that first hour, though, plot twists start to emerge. Maxim starts to pull away from his bride - is he also having trouble accepting her as the new Mrs. de Winter at the estate? Are the differences in the marriage just too much to overcome? Then Rebecca's body is unexpectedly found and questions begin to emerge about how she died. At this point, director Alfred Hitchcock manages to turn what had been a rather empty story into a pretty good suspense/thriller. In that last hour, Hitchcock builds the story brilliantly, so that it gets progressively more suspenseful, and by the time the shocking final scene comes along, as a viewer you're absolutely hooked. It's hard for a movie to overcome such a long stretch at the beginning where little of great note actually happens, but "Rebecca" manages to do just that. It's also interesting as an example of a fairly early piece of work by Olivier. (7/10)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When a naive young woman marries a rich widower and settles in his gigantic mansion, she finds the memory of the first wife maintaining a grip on her husband and the servants.Mysteriously, this is Hitchcock's Oscar winner. Not "North By Northwest" or "Strangers on a Train" or "Dial M for Murder"... but this, which I think the average film lover may not have even heard of. Or, at least, I had not... but maybe that just shows my lack of knowledge.I found the first half hour or so a bit slow. Others have said the film leaves you "enthralled" the whole time. I do not know about that. However, after it got going, I was sucked in ,and i really felt for the main character... it is hard to fill someone's shoes, especially in a relationship. And then the twist... oh my!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The other woman</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Joan Fontaine plays a self-conscious working class woman who falls in love with and marries a wealthy high society man (Laurence Olivier) and moves with him to his sprawling ancestral estate. She is met with bizarre reception from his friends, as well as his mysterious housekeeper, Mrs. Danvers (Judith Anderson) and finds herself haunted by the ceaseless memory of his first wife who died in a bizarre accident outside the property.Probably Alfred Hitchcock's most Gothic work, "Rebecca" is a phenomenal and faithful adaptation of Daphne du Maurier's classic novel; the film itself has deservedly earned its place in the film canon, much as the source novel has in the literary realm. The plain truth is that "Rebecca" is an all-around masterwork. It's easy to forget that this is a Hitchcock film, which is maybe what makes it such an interesting piece of his filmography? while the film has Hitchcockian colorings, it is quite possibly the least "Hitchcockian" of all his films, leaning more as an ode to Gothicism than any of Hitch's signature quirks.Predating the aesthetics of Jack Clayton's "The Innocents", Robert Wise's "The Haunting", and Lewis Allen's "The Uninvited", "Rebecca" is the paramount of spooky mansion films, which is interesting because it really isn't a spooky mansion film at all (yet another paradox). It is not at all a ghost film, though the presence of the eponymous Rebecca haunts every frame just as much as the memory of her torments the leading lady. Fontaine's character is reminded of, compared to, and prodded with the memory of Rebecca at every turn, and the film's shadowy photography of the expansive manor's interiors provide a landscape in which the omnipresent former wife can possibly lurk. Ominous and portentous warnings from the bizarre housekeeper only accentuate the feeling that Rebecca may be lurking in any corner, be it in human or spirit form. As a partial result, the terror that is central to the film is very much psychological; if anything, I'd categorize the film as a psychological thriller, though the thrills are fairly light, especially by today's standards. Tour-de-force performances from Joan Fontaine and Laurence Olivier especially boost the overall impact, with Fontaine believably embodying a woman who finds herself in a new life that is haunted by her predecessor, and Olivier is quietly menacing yet charming and suave. Judith Anderson's legendary performance as the cryptic Mrs. Danvers is also key here, adding a necessary unnerving sensibility as she invokes Rebecca more forthrightly and disturbingly than any other character. Unlike so many films of the era, the performance here are truly timeless.I would say that this is one of Hitchcock's greatest films, but the truth is that it's just a great film, period. It is dissimilar in tone from what the director is most celebrated for, and for that reason is easily separated from his stylistics, though very much an important hallmark in his career. "Rebecca" is an understated masterpiece of Gothic horror that looms over the genre just as ubiquitously as our titular invisible monster. 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Alfred Hitchcock's overrated Best Picture Oscar winner "Rebecca" isn't the best of his career</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In case you haven't noticed, I'm a huge fan of director Alfred Hitchcock and his films. So naturally, you'd think I'd like the 1940 mystery "Rebecca", the only film in his career to win the Academy Award for Best Picture, right? Wrong! In fact, I don't think the Academy Awards are a credible source to find the greatest films of all time since a couple of them don't even hold up well. I'll go even further by saying that after the two times I've seen this particular film, I've been very underwhelmed by what I saw. "Rebecca" tells the story of a young woman (Joan Fontaine) who meets and falls in love with a wealthy widower (Laurence Olivier). These two get married within a few weeks and he takes her to his massive mansion with a great number of employees where they'll spend their honeymoon together. The housekeeper (Judith Anderson) doesn't seem to be very fond of the new bride. And as this couple spends more time there, she begins to become haunted by the memory and presence of his first wife. She becomes haunted to the point where her husband seems to be affected by the memory of his wife as well. From what I just described, the plot wouldn't sound like a Best Picture Oscar winner, would it? Regardless, critics and audiences seem to declare this as a very good film. While I admit that this film is far from terrible and admit to being invested in the film's first couple minutes, it later became too silly and redundant for my taste. But what do I like about "Rebecca" that is worthy of mentioning? Well, the black and white cinematography is pretty sharp and it serves the underlying dark tones of the widower's castle-like mansion well. The performances by Laurence Olivier and Judith Anderson are very strong and their characters enrich the drama as they're supposed to. I found that Franz Waxman's musical score had the right tone for this type of dark story that was being told. For me, "Rebecca" goes downhill when the newly married couple gets to the mansion since the film then operates on a mechanical, repetitive narrative rhythm and sticks to it seemingly for the rest of the film. The couple has a strange conflict, but then everything's okay again. The couple has a strange conflict, but then everything's okay again. The film practically repeats itself and the narrative as a result becomes less and less interesting. I didn't even really know what happened in the last half hour of the picture, that's how inconsistent the narrative became. For that matter, the conflicts or parts of the picture where the couple suspects something unusual is happening in the mansion weren't that exciting. Maybe the reason why was because the story wasn't that thrilling in the first place due to the fact that I didn't know if it was supposed to be scary. I wasn't sure what to feel and how to feel about the events that take place. As a result, I kind of gave up caring and got bored by the film. I wouldn't go so far as to say that this is a bad Hitchcock picture. However, I would say that it's an overrated one due to its repetition and lack of any real thrills. Given the films that Alfred Hitchcock had made throughout his distinguished career, there were some films of his that were more deserving of the Best Picture Oscar than "Rebecca".</fullReview>

Not only does it look very similar, but the film starts out exactly like Citizen Kane with the slow movement of the camera introducing the mansion.

		<shortDescription>The First Hitchcock Classic?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This Hitchcock film was the first he made in Hollywood and he thought it was a compromise because he did not have complete control. Don't let that fool you. This is a classic film by perhaps the best director in history and it offers a view of Gothic horror and/or mystery you won't soon forget."Rebecca" is nearly 70 years old and yet it still projects a surreal world that draws the viewer into its web. Laurence Olivier is convincing as the brooding Maxim de Winter--a man unable to forget his first wife, Rebecca, who died a mysterious death. That presents a big problem for Joan Fontaine as the second Mrs. de Winter. She is a young and fragile newlywed who finds herself in a dark and confusing situation. She cannot fathom Maxim's many mood changes and his cold demeanor and she feels everyone is comparing her to the first Mrs. de Winter.This begs the question why did she marry him in the first place? Was she blinded by his scholarly manners or his offer of a comfortable life? Whatever he presented in courtship changed as soon as he returned to Manderley. He never seemed to grasp the fact that she felt out of place and was confused as to her role as lady of the manor.Some argue that Fontaine was too weak in the role, but I could not find a false note in any of her scenes. She started out as a mousy girl in love who was dependent on a strange, distant husband for everything. But, she fought her way to the truth about the first Mrs. de Winter and became a strong woman at the end of the film.Character actors, a Hitchcock staple, are a big plus in "Rebecca" as Dame Judith Anderson, Nigel Bruce, Gladys Cooper and George Sanders bolster the film. Anderson is amazing as Mrs. Danvers, the manor's housekeeper, whose presence seems to cast a cold and foreboding pall over everything. Her formal manner also has de Winter's new bride completely mesmerized and the give and take between the two actresses becomes a battle of sorts. Maxim seems unaware of the tension between the two and he seemingly has no fear of Mrs. Danvers even though she is so much a part of his tragic past.Although unspoken throughout, Hitchcock resurrects the memory of Rebecca as a tool to haunt all aspects of this film. From beginning to end, there is the strange feeling that she is still alive somehow and has returned to Manderley to claim her rightful place.In 1940, Hitchcock could well have used color for this film, but black and white proved to be an excellent choice. The dark shadows and fog just make the mansion that much more eerie and that includes the billowy curtains, which take on a life of their own when the wind blows.This film was Hitchcock's first "modern" picture, seemingly eons away from his small British movies of the 1930s. It is a Hollywood studio film (in the best sense) and David Selznick's production skills are evident as the "look" of the movie is very good even by today's standards. Even if the director felt this was not his best effort, many critics think this is Hitchcock's first classic film in a long line of them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"She knew everyone that mattered. Everyone loved her."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>By the end of the 1930s, working for Michael Balcon at the Gaumont-British Picture Corporation , director Alfred Hitchcock was heading towards the peak of his artistic potential. Films such as 'The Man Who Knew Too Much (1934),' 'The 39 Steps (1935)' and 'The Lady Vanishes (1938)' became both critical and commercial successes, and so it was only a matter of time before he was tempted over to Hollywood to pursue even greater fame and fortune. Though his working relationship with independent producer David O. Selznick proved constantly frustrating ? Selznick often demanded a large amount of creative control over his films ? their very first collaboration proved one of Hitchcock's most successful, with 'Rebecca (1940)' becoming his only film to win Best Picture at the Academy Awards. Based on Daphne du Maurier's 1938 novel of the same name, 'Rebecca' is a tense, atmospheric Gothic melodrama about the lingering influence of the story's unseen title character, long after her own death.Relative newcomer Joan Fontaine plays a young, modest woman who falls in love with a wealthy widower, Maxim de Winter (Laurence Olivier), who still apparently mourns the death of his wife, Rebecca. Following a humble wedding in Monte Carlo, the two lovers return to Maxim's sprawling Manderley estate in Cornwall, England, where the servants ? especially the chillingly creepy Mrs. Danvers (Judith Anderson) ? find it difficult to accept this young bride as the new Mrs. de Winter. Whenever Fontaine's character finds herself within the walls of her new home, the atmosphere in each of the rooms is discomforting, even suffocating, as she struggles vainly to assimilate into a world for which she is unsuited. Her character symbolically remains without a given name, reinforcing the story's stance that she is without an individual identity; as long as she remains with Maxim, she will continue to be evaluated against Rebecca, and will be forever in the lingering shadow of Maxim's long-dead, "perfect" previous wife.The Master of Suspense certainly knew how to make an entrance into Hollywood, and 'Rebecca' is definitely one of his top ten films {out of the twenty-seven that I've seen thus far}. Though, at 130 minutes, it is one of the longest motion pictures that Hitchcock ever produced, the film never drags nor feels overly cumbersome, with the extended running time merely prolonging the suffering that the audience must endure through Fontaine's innocent, continually-threatened character. This isn't the sort of thriller that lulls you into a false sense of security and then shocks you, since that was simply not Hitchcock's style. Like another Gothic thriller of which I am fond, George Cukor's 'Gaslight (1944),' the main character is forever at ill-ease with her surroundings, and we, as the audience, are never afforded the luxury of feeling safe and secure. Rebecca de Winter is one of the most meticulously-detailed unseen characters in the history of cinema, and, without the story ever straying into supernatural territory, it seems as though her lingering presence is somehow orchestrating the disturbing events of the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Last night I dreamt I went to Manderly..."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of Hitchcock's finest films, and in my top five of all time. What can I say about this movie? I'll start with Joan Fontaine- perfection. In her long career she never equaled her performance as the Second Mrs. De Winter. Incidentally, she was given an Oscar the following year for her role in Suspicion, a vastly inferior film. Obviously a make-up vote by the Academy. When I first saw Rebecca years ago I fell in love with Joan, and I remain so to this day. She proved everyone wrong, including Olivier himself (who incidentally wanted his fiancee Vivien Leigh to play the part) who said she couldn't handle the role. Could you imagine Leigh as the Second Mrs. De Winter? No, no one could have been better than Joan Fontaine.I would like to address some comments made by other reviewers: First, the issue of lesbianism. After reading the novel by Daphne Du Maurier, I understood much better Mrs. Danvers obsessive devotion to Rebecca. Turns out she had been Rebecca's "maid", or "governess" since childhood. Strangely, we are not made aware of this in the film. Whether it was omitted deliberately to suggest that Danvers was a lesbian is anyone's guess. It's certainly suggestive, but it's hard to believe Rebecca would have returned any feelings to the loathsome Danvers, either for her looks or her personality. Danvers' obsession seems much more likely to stem from the fact that she had known and cared for Rebecca since childhood, and lived vicariously through her and her high social position.Second, the issue of chemistry between Fontaine and Olivier. It's obvious Olivier is dissatisfied with his co-star, and it creates an interesting effect. I see Rebecca as a story about a man perhaps incapable of expressing love. From their on screen interactions, it's clear to me that De Winter cares deeply for his new bride, but just doesn't know how to show it. Or perhaps his spirit remains poisoned from Rebecca's cruelty. Fontaine's character, meanwhile, is the personification of love and devotion, and will do anything for her Maxim. This is also the feel I get from the novel about both characters. What we see on screen is two people in love, caught in a spider's web woven by the ghost of Rebecca. And there's nothing wrong with that. They don't smolder like Bogart and Bacall, but perhaps they will learn to after the shadow of Rebecca has been vanquished.*spoiler alert* Another important difference from the novel is Rebecca's death. In the novel Maxim shoots her through the heart; on screen, he strikes her but she later stumbles and hits her head on a piece of ships tackle. This could have been changed because of the Motion Picture Code back then, which didn't allow for "villains" to go unpunished. If Maxim had killed her, he would have had to pay for it. Or, another interesting possibility is that Maxim lied about it. Maybe he really did kill her and made up the accident? Seems more Hitch's style. Intriguing, though unlikely. But, I digress.The storyline in Rebecca flows smoothly with a steady, highly suspenseful pace. Little by little, we see through Fontaine's eyes and hear through her through ears as more and more of Rebecca's secrets are revealed. We watch her painful ordeal as she struggles to force her meek personality on the imposing domain of Manderly. And in the end, she succeeds.The use of light and shadow in this film is unsurpassed in any black and white film I have seen. The presence of Manderly is constantly thrown on Fontaine's character through the ornate windows, casting their shadows on her. When Beatrice tells her in the study that "Mrs. Danvers simply adored Rebecca", we see a close-up of her profile in full lighting as she turns her head in shock and despair, and everything in the background fades to darkness. Hitchcock is showing us how heavily the specter of Rebecca weighs on her mind; she shuts everything and everyone else out.I could go on well past 1000 words about Rebecca. I even loosely based one of the characters in a novel of mine on the Second Mrs. De Winter, and in describing her I quoted Olivier, saying she had that "funny, young lost look I loved." Rebecca should never be lost or forgotten. This film remains an ageless, timeless masterpiece by one of the greatest filmakers of all time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Overappreciated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Rebecca" is often mentioned as one of Hitchcock's finest works. In my opinion, it's his most overappreciated film. I just don't understand what's so good about this overdramatic, fairly unhitchcockian yarn. It goes on and on and on revealing "the secrets of Manderley", and then ends quickly, almost furtively. Maybe the maestro himself didn't like the film neither, because his cameo is a really hard one to catch! Still, "Rebecca" is worth seeing at least for Judith Anderson's amazing performance as the evil Mrs. Danvers.If you're a Hitchcock fan, take notice that Leo G. Carroll (Dr. Murchison in "Spellbound", senator Morton in "Strangers on a Train", the professor in "North by Northwest") makes his first appearance in a Hitchcock movie as Rebecca's doctor (near the end of the film).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is a Daphne duMaurier story, not a typical Hitchcock film...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's silly for those who complain that Hitchcock did not put his usual stamp on this film--and then they cite VERTIGO, MARNIE, SHADOW OF A DOUBT, etc., etc.--when all the time Hitchcock himself has said that this was not a typical Hitchcock film per se. He knew he had a Daphne duMaurier story to tell and he was not able to turn the whole thing into his kind of film because David O. Selznick insisted that they be as faithful as possible to the original material.And it works. REBECCA is a marvelous film, notable for the casting of the up until then rather unknown JOAN FONTAINE in the lead (which gave Selznick and Hitchcock many headaches as they tried to exact the kind of performance they wanted from her), at a time when Fontaine was regarded in Hollywood as a second-rate "wooden" actress who had only done a bunch of supporting roles in "A" films and leads in "B" films. She certainly proved herself up to the task.I think her performance is well nigh perfect, suggesting the timid, insecure young woman who is intimidated first, by her worldly husband, Maxim deWinter, and then by his domineering and sinister housekeeper, Mrs. Danvers (JUDITH ANDERSON). But if there is one major fault, it is that I never really felt the chemistry between Max deWinter (LAURENCE OLIVIER) and Fontaine. It's as if he has all he can do to merely smile at her--he seems to be tolerating her rather than really loving her.Maybe that's because, as good an actor as he was, he was unable to show any real affection for a woman he personally wished were not playing his wife. (It's well documented that there was no mutual admiration going on between Olivier and Fontaine), although she did respect the fact that he could do everything exactly the same in take after take. Not only did he treat her with only lukewarm consideration, but she had to contend with Hitchcock who claims he had to devise all sorts of things to keep her performance on track.Whatever, the end result is what counts and REBECCA is impeccably produced, written and scored (by Franx Waxman) with utmost respect for the DuMaurier story. Supporting roles are all capably played by a British cast including GEORGE SANDERS, NIGEL BRUCE, GLADYS COOPER, REGINALD DENNY, C. AUBREY SMITH and MELVILLE COOPER.The scene where Joan Fontaine finally stands up to Mrs. Danvers, reminding her that she is now the mistress of Manderlay, and the confession scene where she listens and reacts as Olivier explains what happened on the yacht are memorable examples of first-rate screen acting. It is for these scenes where she finally gathers some strength to help her troubled husband that Fontaine really deserves the most admiration. Her earlier scenes as the mousy heroine are just a bit overdone, in my opinion.And so, with the exception of a lack of real chemistry between the stars, I think REBECCA is another example of David O. Selznick's quest for perfectionism in translating a novel to the screen as faithfully as the production code allowed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From the very first, legendary opening lines to the very end this is one of the cornerstones of a cinema history, but where some other old movies are simply, well old, this is something gripping and involving, truly magical, Gothic and strangely faithful both to du Maurier and Hitchcock. Even if director himself was not completely happy with being under someone else control (David O. Selznick was simply not a man to ignore) it has his signature all over the screen, from complicated characters hiding secrets from each others to evil lurking in the shadows, morbid fascination with death, innocent heroine (it never occurred to me earlier that she is never called by her name) lost in the imposing majesty of Manderley to twists and turns of a fascinating story itself. And - the best of all - this is a movie with Mrs. Danvers (magnificent Judith Anderson). Now I can finally admit that I always found her the true owner of Manderley and if anybody asked me, I would drown both Joan Fontaine and Laurence Olivier, in my version Mrs. Danvers would live on and on forever, bringing fresh flowers in Rebecca's bedroom and occasionally even try those silk stockings and underwear made by nuns from convent. (What kind of nuns knew how to sew sexy underwear?) Hitchckock would have been amused to find that audience of the future find the villainess the most appealing character in the movie. I got a lot of fun ideas involving Mrs.Denvers and me but will keep them for myself.</fullReview>

I am confused... *Checks the back of the case*...Well, apparently it IS. Now there's a surprise... Considering it has so few of his trademark flourishes. However, as a major caveat, this really doesn't make much difference at all to the final product. It's a fine film in it's own right, and the fact that it's probably The Master's most frills-free work actually aids it in creating a level of human interest that might not otherwise be present.In a build-up not unlike novels such as Wuthering Heights and Jane Eyre, we are introduced to our heroine, a sweet young girl who tries to be nice to everyone. She meets a brooding, handsome older gentleman, and proceeds to fall in love with him. After marriage, they relocate to his estate, which is absolutely vast. Inside, she will unlocks secrets of the past... As well as tangle with a maid who resents her being there in the first place...We really feel for this young lady (No, I'm not forgetting her name... The film doesn't give her one) as she desperately tries to fit into this new, aristocratic world around her, but failing dismally (mostly due to the machinations of another. Hitch captures her feelings of isolation well, while her husband remains a distant figure, before giving us the BIG twist which sets up the major conflict towards the end.For all the masterpieces he made, I don't believe Rebecca is the first choice most people would go for as Hitch's only Best Picture win (Not even Best Director, he never even accomplished that honour) but it is clearly a highly atmospheric suspense / drama which shows he could do more than just have us on the edge of our seats. 7/10</fullReview>

She looks adorable and she plays the soft-spoken, stuttering, shy, self-effacing heroine well.Laurence Olivier gives his usual excellent performance. The end of the movie has the (now) usual Hitchcockian plot twists, and the viewer feels compelled to root for the protagonist to get away?not with murder, but certainly covering up an accidental death?that would have appeared to be murder.Another spoiler. Rebecca's suicide?by trying to get someone else to kill her?perhaps the resultant scandal being a form of revenge against de Winter?seems implausible. I cannot understand why it is universally accepted in the movie that Rebecca's diagnosis of terminal cancer is a motive for suicide. Most cancer victims I know fight like hell, though a suffering few may have suicidal thoughts when they start to think they are only painfully delaying the inevitable.Overall, "Rebecca" is a brilliant movie by a brilliant filmmaker.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is my all-time favorite movie and I'm 72 years old (making Rebecca three years older than I!) I won't waste space repeating all of the praise that's already been expressed by so many reviewers about the wonderful acting, directing, musical score, etc. I would like to comment, however, on the performance of one actress who never seems to get much credit. It's Florence Bates, who plays the rather short but important part of Mrs. Van Hopper at the beginning of the film. I don't think her performance as the rich, rude, self-centered American traveler abroad could possibly have been more perfect. She interrupts and rudely scolds her paid companion (Joan Fontaine), she pushes herself on Max DeWinter in efforts to scrape an acquaintance with him because of his wealth, she's totally repulsive and she speaks English in the uppity- rich Boston/Philadephia manner. She is rude and insulting at all times.Now here are some amazing facts about Florence Bates. Born in 1888, she grew up in Texas, was from a Jewish family, and was a talented piano student but a hand injury forced her to give up piano. She was a brilliant student and earned a university mathematics degree; taught math in high school briefly, then studied law and became the first woman licensed to practice law in Texas. She was fluent in Spanish and, after radio was introduced around 1920 she had her own Spanish-language radio program in Texas with the goal of improving relations between Americans and Mexicans. She later ran her father's antique shop, and when her husband lost his fortune in the 1929 crash the couple moved to California and operated a bakery. In California she acted in a few plays and finally in 1939 she landed her very first film role--in Rebecca! She ran into Alfred Hitchcock by accident and he knew she would be perfect for the part and offered it to her--her very first film role.Clearly a person of immense energy and multiple talents, she was 51 years old when she made this "film debut" (Rebecca was actually filmed during 1939 but not released till 1940.)As to her acting in Rebecca, the way she uses her voice, facial expressions and general posture and demeanor to create and project the personality of this relatively minor character is, in my opinion, nothing short of genius. If you have a DVD copy of the film, have another look at her brief performance (she is only present in the first half hour of the film.) Watch especially the scene at Max DeWinter's hotel room door as he announces to her that he has become engaged to her "companion." And watch the movements of the camera as it anticipates her glance toward the companion after DeWinter's hand gesture. I agree with reviewers who suggest that Hitchcock should have won "Best Director" because just this scene alone should have won the award for him, in my opinion.As to Hitchcock's use of the camera, I think it's wonderful the way he has the camera OFF the face of the person speaking and, instead, ON the face of the person being spoken to. Example: the early scene in which Mrs. Van Hopper announces the engagement of her daughter and her sudden decision to sail for New York. We only see the back of her head as she speaks--allowing us to focus on the full facial reaction of Joan Fontaine to this awful news.These are just a couple of the touches of genius in acting and directing that I appreciate in this wonderful movie. Virtuoso performances by Judith Anderson and George Sanders in addition to Joan Fontaine and Laurence Olivier and, in fact, great work from everybody involved.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'd actually heard quite a lot of great things about this. To my surprise, I found it just adequate. It's not bad and it's definitely intriguing to an extent, but the story doesn't offer much in terms of great material. The two leads are decent, but it's really Judith Anderson who shines here. Such a wicked role played with such chilling restraint, it's definitely the best performance in the film and it holds up quite nicely today. The twist near the end is somewhat justified (both of them, since it can be said there's two) but the actual ending doesn't do anything special. This is probably one of Hitchcock's weakest that I've seen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A virtual sequel to GONE WITH THE WIND, only without the racism . . .</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>. . . it is no coincidence that the movie REBECCA comes from the fiendish mastermind behind WIND, producer David O. Selznick. After studying his memos to director Alfred Hitchcock for hours, several things become clear. First, Selznick treated Hitchcock as a total idiot, and bullied him to such an extent that any Miami Dolphins offensive lineman would have quit the team if faced with even half the amount of abuse. Second, Selznick decided that the magic formula for making Americans empty their wallets at the cinema box office was to select a period piece from a female novelist at the top of the best seller list and spare no expense on costumes to put a word-for-word Readers' Digest length "picturization" on screen. Fortunately for REBECCA, the censors forced Selznick to accept a change of the key plot point from the book regarding Rebecca's death, which improves the story's believability by at least 400%. An equally important break for this picture is that Hitchcock's one-camera, one-take shooting style prevented Selznick for totally destroying Hitchcock's work in post. (Perhaps the best proof of the virtual meaninglessness of Hollywood's Good Ol' Boy Oscar voting system is that Selznick--NOT Hitchcock--got an Oscar for REBECCA; the best picture awards for THE ARTIST &amp; ARGO prove that, if anything, the system has devolved to an even lower nadir today). Finally, the reason WIND merits just 3 of 10 compared to REBECCA's score of 9 is that the latter is 1 hour, 45 minutes shorter, and is NOT a racist misogynistic marathon melodrama.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A haunting tale of Gothic romance that is a time-stamped style that will forever be acclimated to those thick Female penned stories of love and longing when such things were expected as entertainment. This kind of heavy-handed story could not and would not be done today.That dating aside, we have Rebecca a Film that has quite a reputation. Not only is it a Hitchcock but won the Best Picture Oscar for 1940. But it is not nearly as much Hitch as MGM and Du Maurier. It is a relentlessly sombre and downbeat affair and the Film really belongs to Judith Anderson's Devilish demeanor and Lesbian lust for her former "partner". Her icy performance and some creepy set-ups and chilling explanatory flashbacks make this quite a melancholy Melodrama. The mood switches drastically in the final third and once the tell is revealed things seem anti-climactic.Overall it is quite worth a view and can be embraced as the kind of deep, drowning, sullen Cinema where Ghosts of the libido are never shown and if you come from the lower class you have no need for a first name.</fullReview>

A wealthy woman, Mrs. Van Hopper has a young lady that tends to her needs and young lady takes a liking to Maxim played by Laurence Olivier. They start spending a lot of secretive time together and they fall in love.

Only after her marriage to Maxim was she referred to as Mrs. deWinter. Clues are given throughout the beginning of the death of Rebecca but the lady never asks directly what happened.Through the curiosity of the new Mrs. deWinter, she accesses areas of the house that are considered sanctuaries for Rebecca.

		<shortDescription>Disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not much of a book reader but I LOVED the book and was very excited in school to watch this movie... then right from the beginning I was severely disappointed. The characters didn't reflect the writers picture of what they should have looked like and the acting was way over dramatized. It seems in many cases Hollywood ruins movies for the readers of the original books points of view. Was the acting good in this movie? Yes Was the directing good? Sort of... Was the casting correct and true to the story? NO I never understood why this movie was so popular... probably because most of it's viewers hadn't ever read the book before and since Hollywood loves to change things to make them "better" people didn't notice. If you want to see an amazingly accurate version of this wonderful book, watch the version from 1997 by Masterpiece Theatre staring Charles Dance as Maxim and Emilia Fox as Mrs. de Winter. The casting was PERFECT as was the acting. All the characters fit especially Mrs. de Winter who is supposed to be a little quiet mousy thing of a girl, very naive, who isn't all about glamor like the Mrs. de Winter depicted in the original film, who looked more like Rebecca than the character she was cast to play.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't normally get into love stories, but this love story is so very different than most. All those Hitchcockian twists are great, Mrs. Danvers is deliciously wicked, and the on-screen interaction between Olivier and Fontaine (considering they hated each other when the cameras were turned off) was quite convincing. I have rarely enjoyed movies from this era because I thought the acting was wooden. Maybe it's just that I'm a big Hitchcock fan, but I don't think that's totally it. The lighting is wonderful, providing such crisp detail, the cinematography excellent, the set design marvelous (with the exception of a couple of cheesy fake backgrounds), and the miniature Manderley is exquisite. I would have to say that this movie is one of the best that Hitchcock ever directed, and definitely one of my favorite movies ever. I'll watch it again and again, and I'll recommend it to anyone.Enjoy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"de Winter of his misintent"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hitch's greatest achievement was not his cinematic techniques or his oft and justifiably praised films. Instead, that rotund jokester, pulled the wool over the eyes of the world in general and, more importantly, those of the pretentious cinema dandies who's voices resulted in prestigious awards, by serving up and having it accepted and lauded as the year's best "oh so serious" drama, a flaming, hilarious over-the-top melodramatic potboiler which wound up outdoing any '50's Lana Turner film, any '60's Jackie Susann novel, or any '90's Heather Locklear television vehicle.Blasphemy? I think not!While staying true to the novel's plot and storyline, Big Boy Al, and I must think this was intentional, lets his stars take their characters to the land beyond absurd while all other aspects of the filmmaking maintain dramatic normalcy. The result is pure genius. Joan's shy little ingénue is so cloying and whiny that you want to continually slap her, forget marry her. Florence Bates, as Joan's overbearing name-dropping employer, all but steals the movie's early scenes, as she bullies everyone in sight, delivering her lines in the slyly nastiest of manners. Enter Sir Larry (Maxim de Winter), the most foppish, arrogantly spoiled non-feeling idiot the aristocracy has ever produced, blatantly overdramatic and casually indifferent to everyone else who inhabits the world. His performance is "fall-down funny" brilliant, as he takes care to make absolutely sure that there is not a hint of chemistry between him and Joan, his future Mrs. de Winter.But it's not until Maxim and his new childlike bride return to the family estate, Manderly, that Hitch plays his trump card, Judith Anderson as the gloriously nasty and nuts ("is she a lesbian?") housekeeper, Mrs. Danvers, who is still inhabiting, at least in her warped little mind, in a world lorded over by the FIRST Mrs. De Winter, the enigmatic and unseen Rebecca, whom she was simply "devoted" to, and who perished in a tragic boating accident near Manderly's shores. Miss Anderson turns in the comic performance of her or anyone else's lifetime - watch her eyes (Cloris Leachman owes "Danny" everything).So there is the setup. I strongly urge you, keeping in mind everything you've been privy to here, to sit back with a couple of friends and watch one of the finest comedies ever committed to film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Hovering Ghost</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Poor girl. No matter how hard she tries, the second Mrs. de Winter (Joan Fontaine) just can't quite measure up to the memory of Rebecca, the first Mrs. de Winter, a ghost that hovers over Manderley, British estate of the wealthy Max de Winter (Laurence Olivier). Manderley is an enormous castle-like house, first seen in black silhouette in the opening sequence. It lies in ruins. Yet, there are memories contained therein, and the film's plot structure consists of one long flashback, as told by Joan Fontaine's character. "Rebecca" is a Gothic love story, and Manderley is where most of the story is set.This is a "dark house" melodrama. And it's a good one. Manderley's interiors are imposing and intimidating, like the house manager, the severe Mrs. Danvers (Judith Anderson), whose job it is to please Mrs. de Winter. Yet fearsome Mrs Danvers lords over the place, causing considerable inferiority and grief for Fontaine's character.The underlying theme I suppose is the introduction of disorder into an otherwise orderly, predictable aristocratic circle. There's an ever-so-slight hint of subversion in the story, injected by the main character, lovely but naive, clumsy, lacking in social skills, someone who doesn't fit in among the usual Manderley crowd.The plot's middle Act, set at Manderley, is by far the best. The first Act takes place at Monte Carlo. And in the third Act, the plot turns perfunctory and shifts away from Manderley. We thus lose the "dark house" atmosphere. The film's dialogue strays into exposition in the second half.B&amp;W cinematography is competent. We get multiple light sources in interiors, and lots of shadows. Rooms are big, and the staging creates a credible sense of wealth and aristocratic power.The film's overall acting is very, very good. I don't see how Joan Fontaine, or anyone else, could have done better in her role. Olivier and Anderson also give wonderful performances.Both entertaining and thematic, "Rebecca" is a high quality film that focuses on a young woman put in an awkward situation. The story is haunting and eerie. Despite its age, it still speaks to a modern audience, as most of us feel uncomfortable if we're placed among people, or in situations, that seem intimidating or threatening.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the less Hitchcock of Hitchcock's movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Rebecca' is the first film that Hitchcock made in US and the only one that was crowned with a Best Picture Oscar, although it should be noted that the Oscar was not received by Hitchcock but by producer David O. Selznick, who had produced one year earlier 'Gone with the Wind'. It is somehow overrated in my opinion, as despite being a good movie it is not one of its best, and it's the less Hitchcock of all his films.The film starts as a romance, with young and innocent Joan Fontaine meeting widower Laurence Oliver on the Cote d'Azur to become in 20 screen minutes his second wife. It's 20 minutes of good romance, which let us feel that if he wanted Hitchcock could become a good romance movies director. Second part is the most Hitchcock one with the young wife becoming mistress of the castle which is still haunted and dominated by the shadow of the late Mrs. de Winter (we actually never learn her name - she has no name, Rebecca, the first wife has no face in the film, no portrait left). The psychological relation between the second Mrs. de Winter and the intendant of the house, faithful to the memory of her first mistress is the key conflict of the film, and here we get some of the fine balances of innocence and terror that we well know from other films of the master. The third part falls into quite routine police inquiry, and although the ending may hold some surprises it is this part that is really dusty and did not make it through the six decades since the film was made.There are some good or even bright parts in this film, the acting of Joan Fontaine and especially of Judith Anderson as one of the classical villains of all times is very good (less is Olivier's - this is not one of his great roles), and some camera work is really asuperb. Overall the film is unequal, and too many and too long boring parts make it one interesting but not one of the brightest pieces of work of Hitchcock.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Rebecca (1940) *** (out of 4) The first film in Louisville's Hitchcock Festival is one I hadn't seen in a good fifteen years and a film that I've only watched once, which is rare among the director's work since most of his films I've seen countless times. A "common" woman (Joan Fontaine) marries a rich widower (Laurence Olivier) and comes to realize that the memories of his old wife will wreck havoc on their marriage. I know this film won the Oscar for Best Picture and I know this has a large group of fans (just check out the rating at IMDb) but for some reason it didn't really work too well with me. I remember loving the movie from my previous viewing but it just didn't sit right with me this time so I wouldn't rank it among one of Hitchcock's greatest. The director's style and visuals are all right on the mark but I found the film dragged on a good fifteen minutes too long and I also wasn't that thrilled with all the twists towards the end. The greatest aspect to the film is without a doubt Olivier and it was certainly a nice treat finally being able to see him on the big screen. A lesser actor would have died during some of the darker moments in this film where the character has to go into the "rage" but Olivier pulls it off very well. Fontaine is very good in her role as well but I can't help but feel a tad bit stronger performance was needed. The music score is wonderful as are all the locations and costumes but I'd still rank this towards the middle of Hitchcock's filmography.</fullReview>

I liked Joan Fontaine's acting better than Larry Olivier, I felt she put a lot of soul into her character (her acting may have been enhanced by Hitchcocks comment that everyone on the set hated her) and you sort of felt awkward when she and Maxim were having a fight, you felt sorry for her. Mrs Danvers is just plain spooky, especially giving that hypnotic speech to The Second Mrs de Winter.It's an amazing movie, held my attention, very impressed. A true masterpiece!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Worthy of its place in cinema history, Rebecca remains a lesson to all would-be filmmakers. The opening scenes, light, airy and frothy, played out in romantic comedy style as de Winter meets his second wife in the south of France, soon give way to a more forbidding atmosphere. From the amusing delights of Mrs Van Hopper and sunshine to the menace of Mrs Danvers and the swirling mists of Manderley is a short, but life-changing step for the second Mrs de Winter.Hitchcock's use of light and shadow add to the feeling of foreboding. The fall of shadows across Joan Fontaine as she explores the house adds to the impression of her imprisonment in the rambling old house. And slowly, as ever, the master builds the tension as we realise that there is more to de Winter's first marriage and his wife's death than meets the eye. As one minor quibble, perhaps the scene in which Fontaine appears for the ball in a copy of a gown Rebecca had worn was slightly over-played, given that we could all see what was coming. The acting between Olivier and Fontaine was out of the top drawer, no doubt aided and abetted by Hitchcock's `encouragement' of the personal dislike the two had for each other. Judith Anderson's icy menace makes her perfect in the role of Mrs Danvers and is a strong counterpoint for the fiery ending. Lighting, editing and all the other elements come together to make this a fine piece of early noir.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>WONDERFUL!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rebecca was the second consecutive Best Picture produced by David O. Selznick. Selznick did the right thing in bringing Hitchcock to direct the film and in doing so, turned it into a classic. Hitchcock is a genius and throughly deserved an Oscar. Laurence Olivier plays the rich English owner of Manderly, Maxim De Winter. Olivier gives a fine and tortured performance of a man who is haunted by his dead wife, Rebecca. His performance was great but the only flaw is that his character is annoyingly unresponsive to his wife. Judith Anderson gives a chilling performance as Mrs. Danvers, the crazed housekeeper with a lunatic obsession to her dead mistress, Rebecca. Her lines are classic and it is she who gives the tense atmosphere to the movie-Hitchcock's dark and cold Manderly just enhanced Miss Anderson's performance. It is Joan Fontaine who really gave the stellar performance as the second Mrs. De Winter. She is a shy girl who suddenly marries the haunted Maxim of a great estate. Hitchcock originially wanted Fontaine's sister, Olivia De Havilland to play the part. Olivier wanted his wife, Vivien Leigh. Although both ladies are great actresses, I'm glad that Fontaine was cast because she made Rebecca what it is today. This was the movie that sprung Fontaine to stardom and her shyness of the camera was carefully inputed into the character of the lonely Mrs. De Winter. Her first words: "Last night I dreamt we went to Manderly again" sets context not only to the story but to the character of Mrs. De Winter. She is shy, unused to a formal life, desperate for Maxim's love and most of all, intimidated by the presence of the late Rebecca in Manderly. Mrs. De Winter was supposed to be a plain and mousy person and so, Fontaine had the misfortune of being a beautiful woman playing an unattractive one. However, Fontaine presents other ways of being unattractive--such as that Mrs. De Winter has absolutely no social skills. All in all, Fontaine gave a performance that deserved a Best Actress Oscar. Although she lost out to Ginger Rogers, the Academy gave a compensation Oscar the following year for her less impressive "Suspicion".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Timeless classic from Hitchcock</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Winner of the 1940 Best Picture Academy Award, "Rebecca" was the only film to ever gain the prize for the master of the macabre, Alfred Hitchcock. Yet for this pic we are not treated to the macabre, rather to the story of a lonely widower, who, seeking to make a new beginning, meets and marries an impressionable young girl in the south of France. All appears to be going well until the two return to his stately home near Cornwall, where the memories of his late wife start to haunt not only him but his new bride as well, as she tries in vain to fill her shoes.Daphne Du Maurier's dramatic novel is skilfully presented by Hitchcock as he weaves a web of intrigue and deception for his fascinated audience. One always knows that things will all work out, but the hows and the why-fors are kept just out of reach, leaving the viewer to become deeply involved in both the plot and the wonderful characters.Laurence Olivier and Joan Fontaine are both very enjoyable as Mr. and Mrs. De Winter, the newly weds who have encountered troubled times at "Manderley". The support cast impress also, with Judith Anderson a particular stand out as Mrs. Danvers. Franz Waxman provides some very appropriate music, while George Barnes' cinematography also received an Oscar. Even the effects and Art Direction are admirable in this David O. Selznick production.Alfred Hitchcock never wastes a moment in a movie which is never as melodramatic as some of his other works from that period (eg. "Jamaica Inn", "The Paradine Case" and "Spellbound"). Certainly a very enjoyable and memorable mystery that will entertain a great many who derive pleasure form such timeless classics.Saturday, June 25, 1994 - Video</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Daphne Du Maurier's novel becomes handsome Alfred Hitchcock thriller involving pleasant but naive young woman (Joan Fontaine) wedding a wealthy, mysterious man and moving into his imposing castle filled with memories of his deceased first wife. Despite a stiff opening reel, it's a well-mounted psychological melodrama in the "Jane Eyre" vein. Judith Anderson's Mrs. Danvers has been interpreted (and misinterpreted) to death, and she's indeed a little grandiose, but it is still a stunning characterization; she's a steely-eyed villainess who ranks right up there with the most enjoyable cinema-baddies. The movie gushes and flutters over Laurence Olivier almost as much as Fontaine does! He's quite good, but this turns out to be Joan's picture. Increasingly insecure, nervous, chatty, eager, Fontaine runs the gamut of emotions and is never less than compelling. Oscar-winner for Best Picture, though Hitchcock himself was snubbed. *** from ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fantastic Hitchcock, one of his best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is Hitchcock at his best; just when you think that you've figured everything out, you are treated to a twist that completely turns your perception of the film around. This isn't the twists of modern movies, where you're immediately awe-struck by the sheer unlikeliness of them, but rather twists that send a chill down your spine and turn the movie in a direction you wouldn't have imagined possible. There is almost more suspense and tension in the entire last *half hour* than there is in the collective amount of supposedly suspenseful films of newer time. This is thriller, as it's supposed to be. Don't give us the husband-suddenly-turned-psychotic out to kill his wife, keep the face-less killer devoid of any real motive away, and please spare us the old cliché of the psychopath who rarely ever has a reason for his/her behavior. This is what a thriller is supposed to be like. Constantly hinting at something, hidden in the past, keep us guessing what it is, and just when we think we've figured everything out, pull the carpet out from under our feet. The one complaint I could come up with for this film is that the first half doesn't accomplish much, apart from build-up and character development, but, the more I think about it, the more I realize that that's what makes the impact of the second half; we *think* we know these people, these secretive and hidden people, we think we've figured out what they're hiding, why they are so secretive, and then we hear how different the truth is from what we had expected, and it is devastating, in a good way. To use a metaphor: Just the moment you're sure you've put together the puzzle, someone points out that you've missed a fourth of it, or, rather, points out that the picture is, while it seems logical at its current state, far from the real picture. The plot is excellent, and the way it slowly unravels is perfect. It keeps you guessing and watching, patiently and attentive, and once you're treated to the mind-blowing final half hour, full of twists, tension and suspense, you will not feel that you have wasted the time up to that point; quite the opposite, actually. The film has a very good pace, and is thoroughly interesting. The acting is great; Laurence Olivier as the mystical yet charming Maxim de Winter, Joan Fontaine as the nameless heroine who is humble and submissive, George Sanders as the sleazy, creepy Jack Favell and Judith Anderson as the cold character of Mrs. Danver, who is seemingly devoid of emotion. The characters are well-written and credible. The cinematography is defining of Hitchcock, with plenty of play on shadows and long, lingering pans that only increase the chill down your spine. The dialog is well-written and surprisingly sharp. The whole thing is just amazing as a film. Defining of Hitchcock and worth watching for any competent film viewer. One final note; the last few scenes involve so many twists, so much suspense and tension, that it puts just about every single other non-Hitchcock thriller to shame. I recommend it to any major fan of film in general, as most should find something enjoyable about it, any fan of Hitchcock, and big fans of the following genres: thriller, mystery, drama and romance. This certainly deserves its place on the Top 250(as I'm writing this, it's #105), and should be viewed by any major fan of films in general. 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hitchcock's first US production is distinct from anything he did before or after, most significantly in that it was an adaptation of classic novel. With the exception of The 39 Steps, before and after Rebecca Hitchcock would normally work with original material or loose adaptations of lesser-known novels. After leaving the relative freedom of the British studios, it was also his first time to work with perfectionist producer David O. Selznick, who often exerted as much control over the way a picture turned as the director.The fact of Rebecca being such a highly regarded and well-known novel was clearly something of a straitjacket for such an independent and formulaic director as Hitchcock. There could be no major changes to the plot, little room for Hitchcock to squeeze in his trademark suspense and black humour. Hitch instead sticks to his other forte, using the arrangement of shots to convey mental states, true feelings and relationships between characters ? and at that he is at his best here. In an early scene where Maxim de Winter sits down for coffee with Miss Van Hopper and Joan Fontaine's character, he focuses on Laurence Olivier and Joan Fontaine's reactions, even though the clucking Miss Van Hopper is doing most of the talking. In a later scene at Manderlay we see Joan Fontaine sitting alone at a huge dining table, with the camera slowly pulling out to show her sense of isolation.Hitchcock also goes a long way in creating atmosphere with large wide open spaces, curtains blowing in the breeze and the way he moves actors in and out of the frame. Mrs Danvers' first entrance, walking arrogantly straight into the middle of the shot is particularly memorable. A brilliant example of how Hitch uses a few simple techniques to achieve a change in mood is when Maxim and Joan Fontaine are viewing a reel of home movies from their honeymoon. Halfway through they are interrupted by the butler with the news that an ornament belonging to Rebecca has gone missing, and Joan Fontaine owns up to breaking it, leading to an argument. Before the interruption the camera focuses on the projection screen, and we see footage of the newlyweds happy together. Afterwards however the camera ignores the screen and focuses on Olivier and Fontaine, their faces half-lit, emphasising the tense, awkward atmosphere.Another problem with faithfulness to the source novel means that the dialogue is often overly literary. Joan Fontaine's opening narration sounds particularly lofty. Luckily the two lead acting performances are good enough to carry it. Laurence Olivier is great as usual. I didn't like Joan Fontaine as the second Mrs de Winter on first viewing, but then I realised what was actually annoying me was the way the camera draws in on her and the music swells up for all her emotional moments, which is more the fault of Hitchcock and producer David O. Selznick. Overlooking this, her Best Actress Oscar was well deserved.Rebecca is an engrossing film, and one that stands up well to repeated viewings. It has to be said this is mostly down to Daphne du Maurier's gripping, twisting story. But credit has to go to Hitch for using the freedoms of cinematic technique to convey it. Aside from the minor flaws already mentioned, I can't really think of a better way it could have been done. Whatever the case, it has to rank among Hitchcock's finest films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Felt, not seen....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rebecca (1940)Hitchcock's romantic suspense thriller proves to be one of the most gripping and tangling movies of his career. Rebecca invites you in slowly, and slowly builds on itself. A happy go lucky beginning quickly turns into a movie that touches themes of suicide (Max on the cliff), second marriages, lesbianism (Mrs. Danves and her obsession with Rebecca), incestuous relationships (Rebecca and Jack), murder, and more. Rebecca opens on a down note showing a beat up old mansion and reflecting on better times and then shows a man close to the edge of a cliff. The movie shifts to a happy-go-lucky romantic sugar movie. The well written script and the nervousness and light hearted acting done by Joan Fontiane. The movie quickly changes and soon begins to feel like a mystery or a ghost story with whispers of Rebecca and how no one talks about her and her presence being felt despite being dead for over a year. The camera movements, acting (especially from Mrs. Danvers) and lighting help achieve a suspenseful feel to the movie. The nervous out of place feel that the new Mrs. de Winter exhibits was done encouraged off screen by Hitchcock when Laurence Oliver (who plays Max de Winter) hated Joan Fontiane as the leading lady, this off screen chemistry added to the film. The movie keeps several things secret and keeps hinting ever so slightly at many things. At sometime I thought Rebecca was still alive, or that she was a ghost. The curious and light hearted attitude of the second Mrs. de Winter adds to building the suspense and helps keep the audience guessing and hoping the mystery will be reveled. When the secret of Rebecca's death is finally revealed the movie takes another shift to dramatic and a different suspenseful feel. This shift takes a toll on the new Mrs. de Winter and even characters in the movie spot this. Another important element is the presence of Rebecca throughout the movie. Rebecca is never shown and you never hear her voice, yet she's everywhere in the movie. Her 'R' symbol is almost like an omen within the house.The movie's core is the new Mrs. de Winter and her struggle to fit into her new life. She must learn how to live as a trophy wife, be a socialite, wife, wealthy, and live up to Rebecca, the first wife. Throughout the movie you hear whispers of how great Rebecca was and it takes it's toll on the new Mrs. de Winter, even to the point where she commands," I Am The New Mrs. de Winter."The cinematography is extremely well done and brings scenes to life. The happy go lucky young romance of Max and the new Mrs. de Winter is set in Monty Carlo, a city famous for royalty, thrills, beautiful landscape and luxury. The next location is the massive mansion Manderly, which at first looks inviting, but quickly feels old and empty like a mausoleum. The beach also has a foreboding feeling to it. The loud crashing waves, the fog and a cabin full of Rebecca's possessions.There was one thing that caught my eye is the acting by George Sanders(who plays Jack). A real distracting habit shown in the film is that George was blinking 5 times per second. Also, sadly the using an alias at a doctor's office could no longer work due to the paper work one must go through at a doctor's office. Hitchcock delivered one of his greatest movies with a strong cast, performance, atmosphere, mood and gripping story that will have people guessing..</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A True Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's sad to me that movies are no longer made like this one, so that people of my generation (20's and 30's) can know what a truly great movie is like. The way the plot develops in this film is absolutely brilliant! Movies today are so class-less compared to this. What a performance by the actors of this film. Joan Fontaine's portrayal of Mrs DeWinter is completely convincing and I spent much of the movie really feeling for her. In the scene when she finally stands up to Mrs Danvers ("I am Mrs DeWinter now!"), you just want to cheer out loud for her! After seeing this, I really want to see more movies staring Joan Fontaine and Laurence Olivier to see what else they were capable of. The cast of this film are true artists who understood and got into their character, rather than making the character like their real personality, like so many actors do today. Sometimes I think it would be great if this movie were remade for today's audience, but it could never be done as well as this. A true masterpiece like this one should be left alone, as it will stand the test of time without any help.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ultra-Classy Adaptation Of Classic Gothic-Romantic Mystery</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A young woman falls in love with the troubled Maxim DeWinter when they meet in Monte Carlo. They marry and he takes her to Manderley, his mansion in Cornwall. Once there however, she is overcome at every turn by the ghostly shadow of Rebecca, De Winter's first wife, who drowned under mysterious circumstances a year before.Hitchcock's first American film is a gorgeous adaptation of Daphne Du Maurier's classic novel, sumptuously produced by David O. Selznick. I'm not generally a fan of classical romantic fiction, but Rebecca is most definitely an exception; not only does it have several great plot-twists but the central character is brilliantly conceived and entirely sympathetic, and the brooding Gothic atmosphere of both Manderley and Rebecca confine the drama within a tremendously chilling ghost story. The cast are all first-rate but both Fontaine and Anderson give career-defining performances. Fontaine is tremendous - beautiful and passionate in an earthy, selfless way that fits her nameless character perfectly, whilst Anderson, as the villainous Mrs Danvers, is so good that she single-handedly launched a standard movie stock-character (the over-zealous housekeeper) in hundreds of subsequent films. This was the movie which allowed Hitchcock to paint on a really huge canvas, and he creates a powerful sense of dread - you can almost feel Rebecca's presence in the film. There's a stunning shot of Mrs Danvers opening some drapes, where he suddenly freezes the frame and dissolves to the next scene, epitomising the essence of the story - a place frozen in time, where nobody can move forward or shake themselves free of the past, and everything is stagnating. For my money this is the best Gothic romance ever filmed; a brilliantly directed movie of a tremendous book.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Long, slow, good acting but far too little "Hitchcock",</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Recap: Maxim de Winter remarries with "Second Mrs de Winter" after a short a quick romance at the hotel. Maxim is a very rich man from the top of society while Second Mrs de Winter is totally new to riches and her newfound status. Maxim takes his new wife to his mansion, the huge Manderlay, and they are booth greeted by the staff. But this is not the first time Maxim is married. His former wife, Rebecca, drowned a year ago and her memory lies heavy over the mansion. Mrs de Winter feels totally out of place, like an intruder, and it does not help that Mrs Danvers, the head of the staff, was very fond of the first Mrs de Winter and is acting very cold towards the new wife. And Maxim, when not leaving his new wife alone, acts very strange when anyone speaks of Rebecca. His new wife feels that she has to compete with an idol and does everything she can to please her husband, but as she misinterprets a lot of signs, she fails. And one fateful night, things are discovered that puts the death of Rebecca in question. Accident? Suicide? Murder?Comments: A good acted but unfortunately too long drama/mystery. Hitchcock emphasizes the love triangle between Maxim and his present and former wife very much, and after a while it almost seems repetitive. The movie takes small and very slow steps and very little new is introduced. Until we nears the end, when Maxim's story about the death of his first wife is put in question. Then we get to see the mystery and some of the suspense I think of when hearing the name Hitchcock. But its too late, by then I was already bored and had some of my attention elsewhere.Otherwise, a good production, very good acting from Joan Fontaine, and from Laurence Olivier with the distant character of Maxim. Unfortunately there are some mistakes done. Manderlay is obviously a miniature, and some of the background, mostly ocean, doesn't really connect with the actors. Supposed to be a classic, but I was a little disappointed.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>He's mean. She's brittle. This is a love story?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm forced to say I just didn't "get" or enjoy Rebecca at all. I'm sorry.Our male hero alternates between making his love interest cry and heckling her for trying to please him. He proposes by mentioning it in a flippant and sort of insulting manner from the next room. Our female hero tries so hard to please everyone that she's constantly excusing herself and breaking down.Sure, people like this exist in the real world. But this is not a Leaving Las Vegas story of crippled people... it's portrayed as a true love story. I find it sickening. These days, we look up to strong women, and we certainly don't want people (of any gender) constantly saying thing that are mean.To add on top of this, I didn't feel any chemistry between the characters... declaring their love felt quite sudden, I didn't feel any real chemistry about the hero's angst about his dead wife... the whole film just seemed contrived. The scenes where the heroine isn't quite ready for rich living become repetitive, like beating a dead horse. It would feel preachy if only there were some message to preach. Finally, I'm sorry to say it, but cinematography and things like color have been in films for a long time now.This film left me even more confused than Chasing Amy and I couldn't get all the way through it. I can see from other people's reviews that a murder mystery eventually surfaces. But hey, I did get an hour into the film without a hint of tension so I guess that all happens later. I'm forced to give it a 3 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Maybe one of Hitchcock's best early works, but not one of his best in general</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is worth watching for being one of Sir Alfred Hitchcock's early movies. In that particular category, it is one of the best efforts, but if we talk about his movies in general, this isn't in the same league.The best about this film is the fine visuals and especially the Manderley mansion and respective scenario. It actually starts pretty good but as it runs it becomes a merely average story (although there are good moments here and there) and therefore a little boring. Plus, it is also a tad long.Having that said, practically the whole film is accompanied by lovely background music. Laurence Olivier has a great acting as the short-tempered Maxim de Winter. A very pretty Joan Fontaine acts very well as Maxim's second wife whose name is not once mentioned or revealed. Judith Anderson's acting as the malicious and jealous Mrs. Danvers is very believable. There is one particular scene which is haunting because Mrs. Danvers is taking Maxim's wife to the window as she speaks and both her words and attitude are suspect - they almost suggest that she's advising her to kill herself. George Sanders as Jack is great too.The title character is dead and her presence is only as a haunting memory. But as nearly the whole movie talks about her, she is a permanent presence, as a memory and psychologically.The ending is the worst part. It wasn't an especially good ending. A shame, this movie starts so promising that it seemed that it was gonna be pretty good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>SO different from the book!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now that I have seen so many Hitchcock movies, multiple times on cable, I have decided 'Rebecca' is the best, mainly because of the great story, written by Daphne du Maurier, which I had read as a teenager.I agree with roghache (post of June 17, 2008)completely about the transformation of the second Mrs. de Winter.In the book, she was shy, diffident and totally awed by the image of her predecessor. Rebecca was tall, dark, beautiful, intelligent, talented and knowledgeable in everything. The perfect wife and hostess of Manderley. She assumed that Maxim loved Rebecca and was devastated by her death. It was only when Maxim revealed to her the truth about Rebecca, that he loved her, not Rebecca, that she was released from all her doubts and fears. She was able to stand up to Mrs. Danvers and gave orders. She sent the proposed menu (consisting of leftovers)back and ordered something hot for lunch.In the movie, the 2nd Mrs de Winter just suddenly developed a back bone! This is a very important point in the story. I don't think the movie's change was for the better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rebecca Rebecca......Nice one</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Long discussed as the first film Alfred Hitchcock made in Hollywood as well as the beginning of the legendary conflict between Selznick and Hitchcock. Producer David Selznick had just had a great movie the previous year (Gone with the Wind, 1939) and signed on Alfred Hitchcock for the first Hollywood movie by Hitchcock (his earlier movies were all British). What is less known is that in the entire fabulous career of Alfred Hitchcock, Rebecca was the only movie that won him a Best Picture award. And that too in the year 1940, when competition was fierce with the movie, 'Grapes of Wrath', 'The Great Dictator', and 'The Philadelphia Story'.With an outstanding cast and perfect control of the actors, Hitchcock, who resisted the domination of Selznick in his projects, manages to weave out of Daphne Du Maurier's novel, a Hitchcock psychological thriller. Somewhat against Hitchcock's intent, the story indeed is fairly true to the novel, with a few exceptions necessary to satisfy American censor boards.The movie opens with waves crashing against rocks and a narrative by the protagonist, who will never be given a first name, only Mrs De Winter as the plot unfolds. We meet for the first time the silent but dominant character of the estate of Manderley, the ancestral home of Mr. DeWinter. It is a stunning edifice and more than a little imposing.Flashback to the beginning of the story, to Monte Carlo. A young woman who is a paid companion to an overbearing pompous society matron sees a man brooding, overlooking the cliff. She yells 'stop' thinking him about to jump. Irritably he sends her off.....How the movie unfolds you got to see that yourself. The movie was a great success both critically and financially. It got a total of 11 nominations and won 2 awards: Best Picture and Best Cinematography.As a Hitchcock flick, it shows what the master could do with a few extra bucks in his pocket. With a budget that Hitchcock could only dream about in England, the production values show an exponential improvement which include stage sets, lighting conditions, extensive screen tests, and costuming, to create an environment where the film will live.For Selznick, it was the second monumentally successful film in a row. For Hitchcock, it was the beginning of the love affair that American audiences have for Hitchcock films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am no lover of the classics though I am a Hitchcock enthusiast. As with all Hitchcock films, this one is a great watch. It has an interesting story that will captivate any audience. At any moment you might think you know exactly where the story is going, but there are just enough twists that you're never bored and are more than likely surprised. The most wonderful part is that there IS a story here. It's not just the glue that hangs by a bead holding together great action or unbelievable mystery and intrigue, though there is a good deal of that as well. It's also a refreshing change that while the basic story for most of us today would remind of us other films, it doesn't smack of a tired story that never should have been retold or changed in any way. It is fresh in a dark and brilliant way. The pace is good and the acting is adept even though one might find it stilted in that reactions may seem canned. It is one of my biggest problems with early films and yet, 'Rebecca' is not limited by this. It is absolutely clear why it is an Oscar winning film.Great Sunday afternoon film. If you're looking to expand your horizons and delve into film that doesn't seem like it was made for the sole purpose of advancing a career and making oodles of dough, I suggest grabbing this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great melodrama that showcases the talents of a "pre-thriller" Hitchcock</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rebecca, based on the Daphne DuMaurier novel of the same name is a gothic melodrama about an average woman who becomes the second wife if an English widower, but lives among the affects and memories and in the shadow of his first wife, Rebecca. This film was Hitchcock's first Hollywood venture and his first collaboration with David O. Selznick, a producer with whom he would grow to have a volatile relationship for many years. It is also the first and only Hitchcock film to win a Best Picture Oscar. This film is excellent in many ways, but the beauty lies in the performances of the excellent cast. Joan Fontaine was expertly chosen in the role of the nervous and unsure `second Mrs. de Winter' and the always superb Laurence Olivier is brilliant as the volatile and conflicted Maxim de Winter. While George Sanders is always delightfully smug and droll in his supporting role, the real star of this film is the psychotic Mrs. Danvers, played by Judith Anderson. Her obsession with Rebecca manifests itself into instant hatred and scorn for Maxim's new wife, and Anderson's both understated and at times over-the-top performance is fantastic.As with many films of this era, the subtle jokes and dialogue are extremely dated and laugh-worthy, and the melodrama is palpable at times, but this film is a certified classic and in this reviewer's opinion, Hitchcock's best film until Shadow of a Doubt was released in 1943. --Shelly</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My Rating: ***1/2 out of ****. Rebecca is an earlier Hitchcock picture, it came out in 1940. It represents one of his best films in the 40s. It was worthy of its Best Picture and cinematography Oscar. The acting is great. Laurence Olivier gives a great performance but I feel he rushed his lines at one point. Some say this shows his character is nervous but I could barely understand him at one point. Joan Fontaine gives a brilliant, flawless performance, she should have won the oscar. Judith Anderson also should have won the oscar for supporting actress, she was very scary as Mrs. Danvers. The rest of the acting is good.Hitchcock has made an atmospheric film here, but I believe he did better in the 40s. Make no mistake Rebecca is very good but he would do better in the near future. However, the screenplay is brilliant. Its wonderfully constructed and has solid dialogue. The Sets, Costumes, and Sets are brilliant. The problem I have with Rebecca is I think its starts to drag at one point. The scenes that are overlong are necessary but I was bored at one point. So I dont know how they would have cut them. Overall, Rebecca is a classic and definitely worth watching.</fullReview>

It has a great plot with many an unexpected turn, wonderful cinematography and great acting (Joan Fontaine is extraordinary credible as the innocent and fragile young woman).In all but one respect, it excels Rear Window. Not as much suspense some will rightly argue, but it's entirely compensated by the neat plot.I'll give it a 9 out of 10 in a heart-beat.

		<shortDescription>Patience is a virtue with this film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With Alfred Hitchcock's Rebecca, the viewer's patience is rewarded once he or she has allowed the 'Master of Suspense' to set all the plot elements and back story in place before proceeding to the main thrust of the story. Regarding the acting, Joan Fontiane is absolutely believable as the young woman trying to discover and live up to the legend of Rebecca. Olivier has to convey a very complicated set of emotions, often conflicting, and he succeeds in doing so. All the character actors whom I recognize (eg. Nigel Bruce) from other films are picture perfect in Rebecca as well. To me however the actor who leaves the most indelible impression is the actress who plays Ms. Danvers. She really comes across as loyal to her former mistress and tormenting towards the new lady of the house. I should also mention that all other aspects of the production are more than competent, especially the haunting voiceover at the start of the film. All in all, great classic picture, 8/10.</fullReview>

Because I have infinite respect for Hitchcock, I knew that his choices were carefully planned and that the film would pick up sooner or later. Of course, it did. The end of the film was very gripping, but in order to get to that point Hitchcock spent considerable time developing the situation and character interactions within Mandalay. Looking back on it, the last half of the film wouldn't have been as effective if he hadn't. For the haters of this film, probably those who are used to the pacing of North by Northwest of Rear Window, they likely found the slow pace unbearable.

Judith Anderson makes your blood curdle while she is being ever so proper and polite. And then there is the first Mrs. De Winter -- ah, she is the scariest of all to poor, suffering Joan.

		<shortDescription>Disowned by MASTER OF SUSPENSE</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Atypical of the films Alfred Hitchcock usually did in his career, this David O. Selznick produced feature is the only film to win an Oscar(Best Picture). Like for the majority of his lifetime, Alfred Hitchcock was snubed by the Academy Awards for the Best Director award. Ironic that Hitchcock is considered the top level of technical filmmaking and yet he was unable to win a Best Director Oscar. This shows that the Oscars really reward for the most part the mediocre when it comes to chosing Best Picture and Best director. This was the producer's second feature that came right after his hugely popular but highly overrated feature film, Gone with the Wind(1939). Rebecca(1940) still is a very good film from Hitchcock that has some wonderful touches of gothic atmosphere.Lawrence Oliver is his usuall excellent form for the role of the mysterious Maximillian de Winter. Judith Anderson gives a memorable supporting performance in a AH film as the meancing housekeeper, Mrs. Danvers. Although not completely a Hitchcock motion picture there are still touches of the master of suspense that crop up here and there in the plot. The image of the house burning with Mrs. Danvers in it is a classic image in 1940s American film. Alfred Hitchcock redid the story in a way as the Cary Grant-Joan Fontaine film, Suspicion(1943). Well adapted feature of a novel by a writer who the director would revisit in The Birds(1963).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hitchcock proves himself the Master</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With Rebecca, his first US film Hitchcock proved without a doubt that he was one of the truly talented and gifted film makers ever to pick up a camera. There are none of the bold plot devises and cranked up tension in this film, something that Hitch would later make his own throughout the rest of his career, Rebecca relies on performance. With the great acting, production design and cinematography Hitchcock creates an intensely dark mood.The shadows of the house and the look and feel of everything, the fog that fills the air, the pure black and white images draw us into the story, we don't know what's going to happen next but we can't wait to find out. This use of almost expressionistic style only helps to compliment the performances of the leads. Laurence Olivier is fantastic as the tortured Mr de Winter, a character full of dimensions, we don't know weather to hate him or feel sorry for him, and his performance is so well timed and so well judged that everything fits him. He gives the character both a restrained villainy and a sense of saddening loss at the same time.Then we have Joan Fontaine as "The Second" Mrs. de Winter, her quiet and shy performance means we can feel for her immediately. Her curiosity in finding out the truth behind Mr de Winter spills out onto the viewer, making us all the more interested in the mystery. There is also Judith Anderson as Mrs. Danvers, giving a fantastically devilish performance. Rebecca is all about mystery and intrigue, with a little bit of romance and mild black comedy, that is why I have tried to say as little about the plot as possible, because with Hitchcock it's best to go in knowing nothing at all. And with Rebecca you will be in for a rewarding experience.Not Hitchcock's best, but definitely in the top five. 9/10 </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Laurence Olivier at his finest</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is worth watching just for Laurence Olivier. He's that good. This is an early Hitchcock classic that's more mainstream than his later work and, I think, much better. Pre-WW2, the rich widow Edythe Van Hopper (Florence Bates) decides to spend a few weeks in Monte Carlo with her hired companion/assistant (Joan Fontaine). When the companion is introduced to the recently widowed, wealthy, and handsome Maxim de Winter (Olivier), she is swept from her feet. They marry rather quickly and she moves into his mansion. However the atmosphere is not very welcoming. Most of the staff is still mourning the recent death of the first Mrs. de Winter, Rebecca, and the new Mrs. de Winter cannot seem to fit in. Hard enough as it is to live up to the expectations set by Rebecca, it quickly becomes apparent that some of the staff WANT her to fail. How far will they go? Excellent film. Maybe Hitchcock's best.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Hitchcock Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is one of the greatest ironies in all of movies that the great Alfred Hitchcock won only one oscar for best picture. Some people would think it was Rear Window, North by Northwest, Vertigo, or Psycho. But it was none of those, it was this one, Rebecca(1940). Although the movie drags a little bit, it really picks up after the first hour. Laurence Olivier, Joan Fontaine, and George Sanders all give excellent performances, but it is really Dame Judith Anderson who steals the picture. Just thinking of how she played Mrs. Danvers gives me chills. Rumor had it that Hitchcock deliberately made Joan Fontaine feel terrible by claiming to hate her and getting everyone in the movie to dislike her as well, but the reason why he did it was so she would perform in the title role the way Hitchcock envisioned it. One thing about this movie--I was shocked and you will to when it was revealed in the movie a certain plot element. If you haven't seen this movie, you need to see it. Definitely one of Hitch's 10 best.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>good, but not Hitch's best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A sprawling, romantic, literary drama in the vein of 'Gone With the Wind' does not exactly seem like a typical movie for the so-called 'master of suspense'. And in fact, for much of the movie Hitch seemed out of his element, setting up suspenseful moments, just for the sake of having them, without having any real bearing on the plot. In fact, the plot doesn't even seem apparent until about 2/3 of the way into the picture(which is when you're finally rewarded for enduring the first 6 hours or so). On the other hand, there's nothing wrong with a director stepping out of his element once in a while, and the characters created by Joan Fontaine(who won an Oscar the next year for an inferior Hitch film, Suspicion, in one of the Academy's most blatant make-up votes ever), and Judith Anderson(as one previous reviewer alluded to, Cloris Leachman's comical performance in Young Frankenstein was a certain homage) are among filmdom's all-time best. Obviously, Academy voters, still on a GwtW high, loved it. I personally prefer his other nominated film of 1940, Foreign Correspondant, which was more of a typical 'Hitchcock thriller'. In short, it's a solid 8 or 9 film, but it's not a 'real' Hitchcock movie(one wonders if these types of movies should have just been left in the hands of romantic directors like Fleming or Cukor). Heck it's not even the best movie named after a woman('Laura' takes that prize).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A masterpiece, filmed in beautiful black and white!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the only Hitchcock movie that won an Academy Award for Best Movie, preceeding Citizen Kane by one year. There is much in Rebecca reminiscent of Kane--from the outstanding opening black and white cinematography of the tracking shot of Manderley to the final shot of the embroidered pillow surrounded by flames. The Academy snubbed Hitchcock himself, as they never did award the all-time best director the top prize for himself. Hitchcock's influence is demonstrated throughout the unfolding of the film. As in many of his films, your initial assumptions will likely prove wrong. Laurence Olivier plays a wealthy man haunted by the death of his first wife, while Joan Fontaine plays an "ordinary" young woman who becomes the second Mrs. de Winter. Fontaine's character obviously loves her husband but feels out of place in the vast mansion, especially when the sinister and strange Mrs. Danvers appears. Rebecca holds up well with age. The characters are memorable and the subtle Hitchcockian twists are riveting. Renting this classic will be much more worthwhile than watching 99% of the more current fare available.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I much prefer Hitchcock for his more light hearted movies, such as Strangers on a Train, North by Northwest and Rear Window, but while Rebecca may not be my favorite Hitchcock movie, it certainly is among my favorites (alongside movies like Gaslight) when it comes to this sort of dramatic mystery. It is brilliantly acted and beautifully shot. It's not exactly scary from the point of view of the audience, but you feel increasingly worried for Joan Fontaine as Rebecca's ghost eat it's way into the movie.My only regret is that I have not yet been able to catch a decent copy of this movie. They are always heavily worn, causing white and black areas approach grey and loose contrast and dynamicity.

Adding to Fontaine's troubles is the evil and scary Mrs.Danvers(Judith Anderson)who is the housekeeper that is completely obsessed with Rebecca. Major lesbian overtones here.

		<shortDescription>"I am Mrs. de Winter now."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alfred Hitchcock's first American film won him his only Best Picture Oscar, but in learning about the movie, it's almost surprising that the picture was ever made at all. After producer David Selznick shelled out fifty thousand dollars for the screen rights to the Daphne Du Maurier novel, he hired on Hitchcock to direct the movie. The team up with Selznick was immediately fraught with disagreement. Selznick didn't like Hitchcock's contribution to an early screenplay treatment, and brought in his own team, thereby making "Rebecca" the only picture by Hitchcock that didn't have his collaboration on the script. Hitch didn't want Joan Fontaine as the female lead, Selznick didn't want Olivier. The producer also had difficulty with Hitchcock's directorial method, thinking him too slow in his approach. The result - nothing short of brilliant! Most of my appreciation of the film lies in the performance of Joan Fontaine as the second Mrs. de Winter. Her early appearance is marked by the tenuous acceptance of her role as the mistress of Manderley, constantly ill at ease in the presence of such formality and elegance. Very quickly, Mrs. Danvers (Judith Anderson) becomes her nemesis out of a fierce loyalty to the unseen title character. That bears mentioning, as the first Mrs. de Winter, who is deceased, holds the viewer in an unrelenting grip throughout the story. The constant reminders of the elegant first wife of Maxim de Winter (Olivier) keep one constantly riveted on the unraveling of the Manderley mystery.Though he was top billed, I never got the impression that this was a Laurence Olivier picture. He seems to appear from time to time to remind the viewer that Manderley is part of the de Winter fortune, but it's the war of nerves between Fontaine's character and Mrs. Danvers that give the film much of it's psychological tension. The latter third of the picture that reveals the nature of Rebecca's demise provides the twist that clears Maxim of a murder charge, but it would have been even better to see Jack Favell (George Sanders) twist in the wind over his unfounded accusation.Say, I couldn't help it, but the picture's ending had me making a comparison to another film classic, "Citizen Kane". As the camera closed in on the the letter 'R' of the burning lingerie case in the closing scene, I kept thinking R = 'Rebecca' = 'Rosebud'. Orson Welles had a similar girth to Hitchcock too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An English country estate with tension and not tedium</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Rebecca" is Alfred Hitchcock's film about a woman that marries a wealthy widower and settles in his considerable estate, only to find that the lingering memory of the man's first wife, Rebecca, hampers the couple's happiness. Stories about English country estates with a legion of servants can easily be bogged down and boring, but "Rebecca" proves exceptionally tense and interesting.Joan Fontaine is the "second Mrs. de Winter", who is attempting to overcome the resentment associated with filling a place of high social standing in the stead of the seemingly perfect "Rebecca". Fontaine makes the character enchanting and extremely sympathetic. Every slight to her character and moment of self-doubt is disconcerting to see. Laurence Olivier is as skilled as ever as the distressed "Maxim" de Winter and effectively creates an ambivalent character. Judith Anderson is very unnerving in every scene she is in as Mrs. Danvers.The story has an underlying mystery and various twists that make it interesting. The film's tension is built up masterfully with the help of its sharp dialogue. It is impressive the way the tension returns near the end just as it seems to vanish. "Rebecca" shows us life at an English country estate with tension and not tedium.</fullReview>

The 40s the dialogue was always crisp, clean and the actors enunciated their lines, you understood every syllable. No mumbling or swallowing of words in the 1940s (with the exception of comedy and gangster movies).This is one of best of the best. You never see the violence, death or heated arguments. All of the gory details are presented in a narrative form and yet you are enthralled. It is because the actors were excellent story tellers.And there are a few innuendos and witticisms, some of which if you are not watching or listening carefully, you will not catch. There is plenty of wry, dry English wit to go around in this movie.It is a Englishman's film-noir, which Hitchcock excelled at.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Selznick Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having had a success with 'Gone with the Wind', David O'Selznick enlisted the fresh British talent of Alfred Hitchcock who had just completed another adaptation of a novel by Daphne Du Maurier, 'Jamaica Inn'. Although Daphne was not in favour of what Hitchcock did her novel with Charles Laughton and Maureen O'Hara, she did not stand in his way with the adaptation of 'Rebecca'. Selznick however, listening to the voices of dissent, took precaution by disregarding Hitchcock's development of the script of 'Rebecca', and took creative control by developing it himself. Hitchcock as director rather than producer makes a David O'Selznick film adapted from the novel of Daphne Du Maurier. It revolves around the life of the protagonist played by Laurence Olivier whose late wife is attempted to be replaced with his new alliance with Joan Fontaine. However, the experience of living in the same house that his wife died and engaging with the eery Judith Anderson proves to be a distasteful affair for Joan Fontaine, and with the exception of the appearance of George Sanders, the audience are dragged through the same experience as Fontaine as she endeavours to resolve the problem. Clearly, this is a Selznick film rather than a Hitchcock film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a classic film, not only because it was Hitch's first American film, but because the story and the idea of tragic romance is virtually non-existent in films today. The story centers around an wealthy English man who is suicidal and gloomy after the death of his wife. This role is carried out brilliantly by Laurence Olivier. He meets and falls in love with a young and very naive girl he meets in Monte Carlo. He marries her and brings her back to his boyhood home, called Manderley. This is when the trouble begins. The wife, played wonderfully by Joan Fontaine, is ill at ease as a mistress of the house and is intimidated and frightened at the idea of the first wife, Rebecca, haunting the house and the idea that she does not measure up to Rebecca, who was charming and beautiful to all who knew her. Rebecca allegedly died in a sailing accident, and when the wreck of her boat is found near the estate, all the past rises up again to destroy Maxim and his bride. Films like these are no longer made, which is why they are called classic. If you enjoy suspense, romance, or even Alfred Hitchcock films (Heaven knows I can't be the only Hitchcock fan around!), rent this film. It is rarely shown on cable, so don't look for it on TV. A Hitchock film celebration was recently held on Starz!, Turner Classic Movies (TCM), and AMC and none of these channel showed this film. I cannot recommend this film highly enough!Enjoy a rare glimpse of Hitchcock when he was first getting started in Hollywood, and look for Hitch's quick cameo at the beginning of the film.</fullReview>

However, Rebecca is not a regular,run of the mill Hitchcock film with a lot of suspense.This is because this master of suspense deliberately avoided suspense in order to remain faithful to the original book written by English writer Daphné du Maurier.In this manner a personal touch was added to a film which has been celebrated all over the world.A giant screen of an equally huge cinema hall would ideally be the best place to appreciate this film with one's family as one can appreciate superb black and white cinematography which brings out the best of a Gothic tale.It is true that Alfred Hitchcock made "Rebecca" in USA for an American producer but it is still very much a British film as most of the actors including Laurence Olivier portray genuine behavioral traits of an English society.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Rebecca (1940): Starring Laurence Olivier, Joan Fontaine, George Sanders, Judith Anderson, Nigel Bruce, Reginald Denny, C. Aubrey Smith, Gladys Cooper, Florence Bates, Melville Cooper, Leo G. Carroll...Director Alfred Hitchcock, Screenplay Phillip MacDonald "Last Night, I dreamed I went to Mandalay again"..........Based on Daphne Du Maurier's best-selling mystery novel, this film represents Alfred Hitchcock's earliest cinematic work, devoid of any disturbing psychological aspects or straight-out terror, such as his later works, from "Psycho" , "The Birds" and onward. Instead, we have a well-made movie whose mystery and suspense depends mostly on the haunting aspects of the cinematography and the premise: Widower Maxim De Winter (ably performed by the one and only Laurence Olivier)cannot ignore his dark past and his dead wife Rebecca, whose shadow, memory and "ghost" still haunts the country estate of Mandalay. Nonetheless, he makes the mistake of remarrying again. After a brief romance, he marries a naive and social-climbing young woman (Joan Fontaine) who knows absolutely nothing of the dark secrets contained within Mandalay and how strongly Wife No. 1 Rebecca has affected the lives of its occupants. Rebecca never appears in the film and remains only a mentioned character (though we do see what she looked like in a portrait). Judith Anderson, in a terrific performance, portrays Mrs. Danvers, the housekeeper and Rebecca's most devoutly loyal friend and guardian. Mrs. Danvers resents Wife No. 2 and is openly hostile to her, claiming she can never be anything like the great Rebecca. The first part of the film can easily be mistaken for Bronte's "Jane Eyre", with its sprawling and haunting mansion and "dark secret about the first wife". But toward the end, the film takes on a different style - the courtroom drama. Even as such, the film is consistent and full of suspense, keeping us to the edge of our seats (I imagine audiences at the time were). If not quite faithful to the Daphne Du Maurier novel, it represents cinema of old Hollywood, which was full of great acting and great drama, the likes of which we don't see today. These actors live their roles, their British background in theater serves them well. This is also Hitchcock at his most versatile. He creates a powerful film, and one whose scenes are still ingrained in people's memories, such as the scene in which Joan Fontaine dresses up, unknowingly, like Rebecca to a costume ball and upsets the guest and Maxim and the final scenes, in which Mrs. Danvers, in a fit of rage after Wife No. 2 is found innocent in the trial and will indeed become the next mistress of Mandalay, sets fire to the home. A close-up within the burning house reveals a burning bed, then a burning pillow, then a burning single letter R. Rebecca casts a powerful spell and this is one of the greater mystery films of 1940.

		<shortDescription>It's clever, but is it Art?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The tragedy of this film -- at least to anyone who knows the book, which is naturally a self-selecting and biased group -- is that the pacing is terribly uneven. It's almost as if the studio suddenly noticed that the picture was going to run twenty minutes over its allocated slot, and ordered the final scenes to be cut to the bone and run together at breakneck speed. The result, for me, is a curiously unsatisfying finale; why go to the trouble of altering the original plot to ensure that Maxim's wife is in the house when it is set on fire, for example, and then cut the sequence so quickly that there is no real element of suspense whatsoever? It's a tragedy precisely because the film was potentially so good. I've seen stage adaptations of the same story, and they totally failed to catch the book's mingled atmosphere of sunlit happiness and suspense -- the taint of Rebecca reaching up from the past to destroy the innocence of the present. Right up until the moment when the heroine descends the staircase, however, this version is almost flawless; the comedy, the romance, the crippling social humiliations, the country-house interiors, the monstrous Mrs van Hopper, kind and tactless Beatrice, insinuating Jack Favell, aloof Maxim... and, of course, Joan Fontaine, who might have been made for the part. I had no mental image at all of what the book's heroine looked like -- but the moment I saw Miss Fontaine I knew she was absolutely right. Arguably she is too beautiful, almost distractingly so at times; but her style, her body language, the schoolgirl simplicity of her face, are all exactly fitting to the mood of Daphne du Maurier's unnamed narrator.My problems with the film start when it tries to become a thriller. Having retained the book's long build-up to the revelations, Hitchcock then suddenly seems to lose interest in their results: Maxim's fury and his wife's misery over the Caroline de Winter costume are barely glimpsed, and the nightmarish build-up of the book to the gallows, from this point on until the final revelations in London -- and their totally unexpected outcome -- is translated instead into a series of short sequences that convey little atmosphere beyond the bare mechanics of the plot. The scenes where the heroine is caught 'trespassing' in her predecessor's bedroom and breaks down are overwrought and unconvincing, one of the rare occasions where Joan Fontaine puts a foot wrong.However, the scenes during the inquest and in the inn afterwards -- as Favell's little blackmail attempt misfires -- are an example of effective adaptation, and the role-reversal scene between Maxim and his wife is both touching and poignant; she has paid for the newly-acquired strength to support him with the loss of the youth and freshness that first brought them together. From now on the marriage will stand or fall on the bond of mature affection they have managed to create. It is precisely because the film *can* succeed where it allows itself space that I find the cramped outcome so frustrating! A major problem for Hitchcock in moving to America was, of course, the Hollywood requirement to tone down the central plank of the plot: the fact that Maxim was genuinely guilty of Rebecca's murder. This weakens the whole 'confession' scene, since covering up an accidental death is scarcely a crime worthy of such moral agonising, and undermines the critical moment of revelation: instead of the simple and terrible "I shot her, but she was still smiling", we get "I hit her, she looked almost pleased, I was about to hit her again, when she fell down through the open door and hit her head on some old ship's tackle which was lying around". As a means of suicide, inciting your husband to punch you in the jaw seems less than encouraging...Oddly enough I was rather disappointed in Mrs Danvers, who didn't seem as sinister as I'd been expecting; she is polite and unenthusiastic, but doesn't betray the seething jealousy and ill-will the script ascribes to her. Since none of this is ever explicit, but only her unhappy mistress' perceptions, I suppose it's hard to convey -- and after all, if she were as openly witch-like and malicious as the girl sees her, other people would have noticed. I wasn't entirely won over by Laurence Olivier either, as he allows a slight air of boredom to creep in now and then -- the actor bored with the part, alas, rather than the character paralysed with ennui. By and large he is adequate to what is mainly a shuttered role; from time to time, as Maxim opens out, he is excellent, but I did get the impression on occasion that Olivier would rather have been doing something else.This is really a one-woman show, with all the other performers as supporting actors. Joan Fontaine deserved the Oscar for which she was at least nominated, and her portrayal of a gauche girl's growing maturity is the luminous centre of the film -- which makes it all the more unbalancing when the deliberate choice is made to strip her out of the plot at the end! The story has been all about her reactions, and the novel remains so: but in Hitchcock's finale we have the facts alone without any reaction at all -- Olivier underplaying as elsewhere -- and the unintended result is to rob vital sequences of their emotional depth. It remains a clever plot, but clever on its own isn't quite enough.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>We never meet the title character of this classic Alfred Hitchcock film. However, she inhabits the halls of Manderley as if she was alive and watching everything that occurs. Through her medium, the mysterious Mrs. Danvers, Rebecca still ominously dominates the inhabitants. And ominous is exactly the right word to describe the real star of this film, Judith Anderson (before she was a "Dame"). Mrs. Danvers floats through the house, intent on her task to prevent the new Mrs. DeWinter from taking her rightful place as the Lady. Through innuendo, menace, and her belittlement of the young woman Mr. DeWinter brings home from Monte Casino, there is utterly no doubt that Danvers wants to destroy her employer's or any other person's chance at happiness.If we never see Rebecca, we are also never told the name of the childlike woman brought home as Maxim DeWinters' new wife. This is a brilliant device (both in the book and film), because it makes it easier for each of us to visualize ourselves wandering those halls, looking at the portraits in the gallery, and always thinking that Mrs. Danvers will float from nowhere, to work Rebecca's evil from beyond the grave, making all of us know that we will never be good able to measure up to the maid or her mysterious Rebecca.</fullReview>

But when she arrives at his estate called Manderlay, she finds that her new husband's first wife Rebecca still has a hold on the staff and her husband. As the film progresses, the viewer sees that not all is as it seems on the surface.This is a wonderful, suspenseful thriller that builds gradually through the course of its slightly over two hour running time to an exciting climax. But in order to get there, we are treated to a variety of plot twists and turns that constantly leave us wondering where the truth lies.The film is beautifully shot, the acting is excellent, the suspense just keeps building and the plot is interesting.

		<shortDescription>One of Hitchcock's best films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rebecca is directed by Alfred Hitchcock, has a screenplay by Robert E. Sherwood, is based on the novel by Daphne Du Maurier and stars Laurence Olivier, Joan Fontaine, Judith Anderson and George Sanders.Maxim DeWinter(Laurence Olivier)goes to Monte Carlo to get some peace after his beautiful wife Rebecca drowns in the sea in England.He meets a shy young woman(Joan Fontaine who is never named in the film)and they fall in love.They get married and return to his mansion.His new wife is fascinated and haunted by the memory of the dead Rebecca who's presence envelops the house like a cloak. The sinister housekeeper Mrs Danvers(Judith Anderson)creeps around determined not to let the new Mrs DeWinter take the place of Rebecca.She preserves her rooms and clothes exactly as they all were on the night of her death.Maxim won't talk about that tragic night and we eventually learn why.We also learn that Rebecca was a horrible woman and hurt Maxim by sleeping with other men, including the suave and charming Jack Favell(George Sanders).We eventually learn the truth about the supposedly good Rebecca DeWinter and learn that appearances and talk about a person can be deceptive.Joan Fontaine gives the best performance in this as the emotionally fragile and gentle Mrs DeWinter, a woman who is overwhelmed by the memory of the dead Rebecca and desperately in love with Maxim but terrified at not being able to fit into his way of life.A must see with great photography,acting,music and costumes. Rebecca is part ghost story, part romance and part detective story. This is another classic from the master of suspense and is a wonderful adaptation of Du Maurier's story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Observation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Does anyone else think its possible that Mrs. Danvers was either Rebecca's mother or maybe a sister? Given Hichcocks hobby of adding subtle items into his movies, this idea is plausible from the Director's motive. That Director's like to add their own styles to books and plots makes my observation also plausible. Couple of comments in the movie that have led me to this question are the Dr.'s comment at the end of the movie that "Mrs. Danvers had been coming to see him for years". Also that Rebecca uses the name Mrs. Danvers. The other thing that makes it possible is that Rebecca had a sordid past, according to Max's narration of their visit 4 days after their marriage.Also, Mrs. Danver's complete obsession with Rebecca, ultimately leading to her own similar deamatic suicide ( a wish to die in the same method as she believed Rebecca died), and destroying Manerlay in the process. That Manderlay was made into its current style by Rebecca also adds a bit more to my conclusion. It is also very obvious the cousin is not really a cousin for many obvious reasons. So he would not have known her past. There are a few more tidbits that can also make my conclusion plausible, but I will ask you to re-watch the movie with my conclusion in mind and see what you think.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the finest of all literary adaptations</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You might feel like giving the second Mrs DeWinter a good shaking, (we never learn her Christian name), and screaming, 'For God's sake, woman, pull yourself together', but there is no denying that Joan Fontaine's pitch-perfect performance is one of the greatest casting coups in the history of the movies. A year before Fontaine was just a mousy supporting player before being cast as the mousy lead in this classic adaptation of the Daphne DuMaurier novel, one of the finest of all literary adaptations, (the screenplay is credited to Robert E Sherwood and Joan Harrison). Fontaine was born for the role and was never this good again and the Oscar she should have won, they gave her the following year for a much less interesting performance in "Suspicion", (ah, the good old days of sympathy voting). But then all the performances in "Rebecca" are perfect; few films are this well cast.Olivier is simply extraordinary as Maxim DeWinter, the dour master of Manderlay. The year before he was a magnificent Heathcliffe, the dour master of Wuthering Heights, but his performance here is even finer. It is an intuitive piece of acting, as good as anything he did in later years, finding the deep, dark heart of a character that might have been merely novelletish if played by someone else. And then there's Judith Anderson's definitive Mrs Danvers who transcends the potential pantomime villainy of the part with a wonderfully subtle piece of acting. Elsewhere, there isn't a duff performance in site, (Florence Bates' Edythe Van Hopper is particularly treasureable).Indeed this is one of the few screen adaptations of a good book that improves on the original; the acting alone would see to that, but it is also psychologically astute and as one would expect, magnificently directed by Hitchcock who molds the material into another study of somewhat ordinary, average people caught up in extraordinary events. In this respect it's as recognizably Hitchcockian as many of his later films, and like the best of his later work it stands up to repeated viewings.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Last Night I Dreamt I Went to Manderley Again!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If 1939 was Hollywood's greatest year, 1940 certainly followed it mighty close. And of all 1940's marvelous movies, Rebecca is one of the most enduringly entertaining. In fact, it has not dated in the slightest and is still one of the most suspensefully intriguing, rivetingly fascinating of all Hollywood's essays into the realm of the romantic Gothic thriller. Among many reasons for this success, I offer the following thoughts at random: (1) Daphne du Maurier is one of the most talented and articulate writers in this field and her novel has been expertly adapted; (2) despite his disclaimers, Rebecca is the sort of movie at which Hitchcock excels. It has a brooding atmosphere of mystery and horror that Hitchcock is able to play up to such an extent that it becomes more important than the plot. This is a major triumph because when boiled down, the plot is actually rather familiar, even (dare we say it?) trite. Hitchcock's creation of this richly pervading atmosphere which leads to such a complete suspension of our minds, is achieved by his masterly control of pacing, acting, composition; and his ability to influence photographer, composer and set designers to produce the right effects. Notice, for example, that Manderley is really a castle of the mind. It is too shadowy, too remote, too unreal because it is in the mind. It exists now only in the heroine's mind. "Last night I dreamt I went to Manderley again." As these words are visualized on the screen, we don't see a real Manderley, but a Manderley of the mind, a nightmare, a ghost. This is Hitchcock at his most accomplished. Never mind Foreign Correspondent with all its showy bags of directorial tricks. There are just as many brilliant displays of legerdemain in Rebecca, but they are thrice as effective because they are so imperceptible, so subtle; (3) Rebecca is blessed with a most gifted cast. Joan Fontaine is exactly right and never gave a finer performance. It is really a most difficult role. The heroine in these Gothic romances is frequently some colorlessly bland little mouse of incredibly limited experience. Joan takes this stereotype and works on it with such persuasion that she brings the character not only to a vivid life, but to an astounding pitch of audience sympathy and identification. Olivier also delivers an admirably judged performance, giving de Winter effective shades of moodiness. The rest of the players are equally adept, though all are rightly overshadowed by Judith Anderson, whose coldly intense housekeeper is easily her most memorable and haunting role.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pioneer of the Used Car Salesman Character</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hitchcock deserves props for his role in developing the Sleazy Car Salesman archetype with George Sander's Jack Favell. At the beginning, Favell appears as a dashing, charming bachelor (think a more rugged Hugh Grant.) By the end, he is a sleazy, blackmailing, cousin-humping, used-car salesman . . . he literally is a car salesman (in a scene near the conclusion, he implores the chief constable to come see him if he needs a new car.) Hitchcock helped pave the way for future "Sleazy Car Salesman" characters such as William H. Macy's Jerry Lundegaard in "Fargo" and Robin Williams' Joey O'Brien in "Cadillac Man" to name a couple. Overall, the success of this film was due in no small part to the decision to cast the 20-year old neophyte Joan Fontaine as the new Mrs. De Winter; she played the role perfectly as she appeared to be intimidated and uncomfortable in her surroundings. This can largely be credited to Laurence Olivier and Alfred Hitchcock for being a couple of pricks. It has been widely noted that Olivier was upset that his girlfriend Vivian Leigh was not given the role, so he took it out on Ms. Fontaine. Hitchcock, not one to shy away from a little psychological manipulation, decided to further Ms. Fontaine's torment by telling her that EVERYONE on the set hated her for maximum character affect.If not for the overbearing score (it's like John Williams on amphetamines coupled with a deaf sound editor) this would be a great movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Last night I dreamt I went to Manderley again." So begins the Daphne de Maurier novel and so begins this film wonderfully adapted from it by Phillip MacDonald and brought to life by Director Alfred Hitchcock of the strange days of the life of the second Mrs. de Winter. Despite what it says here on IMDb about Hitchcock winning an Oscar for Best Director for this film he did not. John Ford won for Grapes of Wrath. Hitchcock was nominated five times including for Rebecca but amazingly he never won a Best Director.This did win the Best Picture for 1940 which of course is the big award to win but it was otherwise shutout from it's 11 nominations. This is a fine film with a great cast of Joan Fontaine as the 2nd Mrs. de Winter along with leading man Laurence Olivier as her husband and Judith Anderson as Mrs. Danvers. The film's title character Rebecca, the first Mrs. de Winters never appears in the movie except in a portrait. George Sanders, Nigel Bruce, Reginald Denny and Leo G. Carroll round out the fine cast. David O. Selznick showed with this film a preview of what great films would come from his studio in the 1940's following his monster hit the year before of Gone With The Wind and Hitchcock with this gave all a preview of what was to come from him. This is a beautifully done film and like the novel is now a classic. It's not as suspenseful as other Hitchcock films to come. It's sweeping landscapes and large interiors has the signature look of a Selznik produced film. I've seen this film several times and would rate it a 9.5 on a scale of 10 and highly recommend it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hitchcock Meets Hollywood</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hitchcock himself was dismissive of REBECCA. In some respects it is easy to see why: the film is very much a lavish Hollywood romance; the nature of the story offers little room for the director's legendary talents; and censorship issues of the day effectively prevented the film from touching upon the most startling plot twist of the original novel. Worse still, Hitchcock found himself strangled by producer David O. Selznick, who was legendary for control-freak attitude. And yet, in spite of all these problems--and in spite of Hitchcock's own feelings about the film itself--REBECCA remains one of Hitchcock's most praised and widely admired films, and with good reason.The film is perhaps Hitchcock's single finest exercise in pure atmosphere. Every frame manages to convey a combination of misty romance and increasing emotional disquiet, and the look feeds beautifully into the famous story of a mousy second wife who becomes increasingly insecure about her wealthy husband's seemingly perfect and mysteriously dead first wife, Rebecca. The script is remarkably strong, and the cast, with Dame Judith Anderson offering a truly legendary performance as Mrs. Danvers, is particularly fine. Everything about the film is dreamy, slickly produced, and expertly executed, and even the most jaded viewer will likely be drawn into the film's quietly mounting sense of insecurity and paranoia.If this film had been made by any one except Hitchcock, I would have given it a full ten stars--but Hitchcock would quickly break Selznick's control and he would go on to make a host of still greater films, often working without a producer of any kind at all. REBECCA is an exceptional film, but it pales beside the director's later work.Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To give credit where it is due to the creators (along with Hitchcock himself, who began as a scenic designer) of Manderley -- fully as important a character in "Rebecca" as any.Ignore the sadly unconvincing miniatures of the exterior of the mansion (apparently, but not necessarily, credited to the otherwise amazing Jack Cosgrove). From our first glimpse of it, in the moonlight, and throughout the film it is never more than a scale model.Rather it is the INTERIOR of Manderley that is so brilliantly, hauntingly realized and alive.Art Direction was by Lyle R. Wheeler. His Art Department was comprised of Howard Bristol, interior decorator, Joseph B. Platt, interior art director, and Dorothea Holt, illustrator (uncredited).Though completely constructed piecemeal on soundstages, Manderley feels and looks as if it were a real mansion. Gradually, its floorplan becomes crystal-clear to the viewer. Its walls, solid. Its furnishings, there forever and inevitable. Rebecca's suite, perhaps the most beautiful one has ever seen -- exactly as Mrs. Danvers describes it.The decoration, "dressing," and lighting of these sets is truly some of the most characterful and haunting ever captured on film.Though, in fact, we don't really see much of the interior of Manderley (Hitchcock was famous for building only what he needed, and EXACTLY what he needed, even if only a tiny corner of a room, or a wall, for a scene), we nonetheless feel we've been privileged to visit one of the most stately mansions on earth.Thanks to the talented artists above (and no doubt, others) who contributed to the look and vitality and breathtaking realism of "Rebecca's" unsung character, Manderley.</fullReview>

She displays that apprehension with total believeability.Of course there's George Sanders eating chicken in the Rolls Royce. No one,but no one, can eat on the screen like him. He also eats in Samson and Delilah" playing the Saran. If you havent seen this masterpiece please do. It's wonderful.</fullReview>

Joan Fontaine is a poor nobody girl without even a name that marries a wealthy man (Laurence Olivier), with a large home and problems from with the death of his wife, Rebecca.

		<shortDescription>A Hitchcock's fairy tale</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILERS ALL OVER ITWhen it comes to analyse Hitchcock's filmography it's necessary to make a difference between the films he chose to do and the ones that were imposed to him. "Rebecca" is one of the imposed ones (he wanted to make a movie about the Titanic -probably then Cameron wouldn't have dared to touch the subject and we would have one crap movie less in the world, but never mind- to gain himself a place in Hollywood -for until that moment he had worked only in England- but O'Selznick -the american producer- changed his mind about the Titanic project and gave Hitchcock this best-seller by Daphne DuMaurier; by the way, another tale by the same writer was the base for "The birds", another Hitchcock classic; what a long parenthesis I've made; but I digress). Surprisingly, it's the only Hitchcock movie ever to win an Oscar and a truly cinema classic, besides one of his best movies from the Selznick period (the other being the amazing "Notorius"; but I digress again).Ok, I'll focus in the movie. It tells the story of an un-named heroine, shy and innocent, who marries the tormented mr. De Winter, a rich fellow tormented by the memory of his dead wife, Rebecca. When the new couple arrives to the castle that De Winter owns, the girl finds herself oppressed by the constant reminders of the dead mrs. De Winter and frightened by an evil maid. The story is waaaaaaay too twisted when the crime angle appears, and it appears quite late, so don't expect a masterfully executed plot. But the truly amazing aspect is the psychological situation of this girl who is doomed to fail in comparison with Rebecca (who later on the movie reveals to have been a femme fatale who kept cheating on mr. De Winter) and in the beautiful direction style. And of course, a special mention to the astronomical dumbness of the Hollywood censors, who couldn't spot a tacit but obvious lesbian character, mrs. Danvers the maid.The actors couldn't be better chosen, specially Joan Fontaine who is truly admirable and an astounding beauty. Laurence Olivier is also great and the cast in general, exclusively british -although, like I said before, it's an american production-, is amazing.So, I can highly recommend this film to those who want to see one of Hitchcock's earlier gems. And for those who want to have a hell of a time with a good piece of cinema.SAY NO MORE</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is very much a love it or hate it Hitchcock movie. I think its outstanding. One reason people may hate it is the suspense takes a long time to build up and Hitchcock himself didn't seem to fond of it. But don't let that fool you- this is a great and twisted love story mystery movie. Joan Fontaine's character is one of the greatest reasons to purchase this. This is Hitchcock's first picture in America and his first under producer David O Selznick. Don't miss out on this classic. The Criterion version is recommended once again- a LOT of extras.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I've seen better films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wanted to like it, because so few movies deal with grief, nostalgia and languid languor languorously languishing. Alas, all the waves of Cornwall cannot wash away the soap. This is a glorified radio play (like "Laura"), shallow, merely anecdotal, heavily dependent on one idea and one surprise twist. It has that typical shapelessness of a movie based on a novel. There are unintentionally comical inconsistencies. Olivier is a closed book throughout the movie, yet in the end - for no reason at all - he becomes loquacity itself, spelling everything out to the last detail with an almost effeminate luxuriance. He is too generic to be really interesting though. The most interesting characters are that Mrs. Yaketyyack at the beginning, and the weird housekeeper, whose evil seems to reside in her not being wealthy, young or beautiful. More idiosyncrasies should have been crammed into the movie to make it at least interestingly anecdotal - and I don't mean Sanders eating a chicken leg. The humor potential is not exploited. There is humor in everything. Humor is not an option, it's a fact. There is humor (or should I say humour) in the fact that rich people are weighed down by their problems, problems which the poor would do anything to have! This cinematographer confuses luscious with artistic, throws marble and mahogany, chandeliers and candelabra at you hoping you'll mistake it for art. It is kitsch. The camera isn't daring enough, as if afraid of making a booboo. Because movies are such huge productions with so much money at stake, experimentation and playfulness are understandably strongly discouraged, and the results are often generic and devoid of merit. Too many movies are far more interesting than they are good. This one fooled at least two professional critics, published in book form, who gave it the highest rating. Believe it or not, one of them asserted that this film has well-developed characters. It is not a movie's business to develop characters. Movies are necessarily sketchy. The goal should be a more vivid sketch, not cardboard cutouts. In general, I don't like movies that expect you to have read the novel. I don't read fiction.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm told that Hitchcock actually only put the finishing touches on this, but I don't care. It is a devastatingly perfect realization of a great story. In case you didn't know, in the novel, Maxim is actually guilty but gets away with it. Whether it was Hitch or someone else who made the decision, giving Maxim a legal excuse for Rebecca's death and then never making it come out at the inquest anyway was a triumph of intelligent script writing.I've seen this so many times I can remember practically every line. Here is not a line, but a bit of acting: Joan Fontaine suddenly becoming a mature mistress of the house after she hears the whole story from Maxim. Glorious acting and direction. Heavens!Judith Anderson in a role so epic that it was commented on facetiously in other films (watch Abbott and Costello's charmingly comic "The Time of Their Lives"). The complexity of the marriage which is still dominated by love and so well portrayed. The end where you never do figure out how the second Mrs. DeWinter got out of the burning house and don't care. One of the greatest movies of all time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the very beginning of the Rebecca, a female narrator takes us inside the Manderlay, we've been prepared to hear a story about Manderlay or something behind it as we pass through the gate. Later on, we know the late Mrs. Winter, a.k.a Rebecca is the one who haunted this place. Even we have been following the innocent Mrs. Winter (later on, Mr.Winter) to uncover the truth, we still learn very little about Rebecca herself. What's behind the Manderlay is gone with the burndown of the house. There are more secrets than we learn about in the film, such as Maxim's confession and Rebecca's illness. This is exactly what makes Rebecca so haunting. No clue left for us but to go back the Manderlay again, which resonates the beginning sequences. "We can't never go to Manderlay again, but in my dream."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the great films from Hollywood's Golden Age</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the great films, Best Picture of 1940, the legitimate offspring of one of the industry's most successful marriages: Producer David O. Selznik and Director Alfred Hitchcock. Olivier is one of those rare actors, like Marlon Brando and Richard Burton, who was both a great actor and a great star. We're so used to seeing him as an old man, it's a treat to seem him young, dashing, and unbelievably sexy. Joan Fontaine is marvelous as the mousy, fearful young lady who becomes the second Mrs De Winter, who can't believe that a man like Maxim DeWinter (Olivier) would even look at her, let alone fall in love with her. Gradually she comes into her own, finding courage, warmth and the strength of her personality. The rest of the cast is a veritable who's who of fine British actors: Melville Cooper, Sir Aubrey Smith, Leo G. Carroll, Reginald Denny - but Dame Judith Anderson (whose Lady MacBeth and Medea would set the standard for those great characters in literature against which all actresses who attempt them must be judged) almost walks away with the show as the psychotic, despicable house mistress, Mrs Danvers whose obsession with the late Rebecca (the first Mrs. DeWinter), borders on the perverse. George Saunders, oozing hair oil from every pore, is deliciously slimy as the villain, a scoundrel without conscience or integrity, who kisses and tells and subjects Maxim De Winter to loathsome blackmail. (Zsa Zsa Gabor, one his wives, said that he was so vain that he was the only person she ever met who spent more time in front of a mirror than she did!) This film was made in the glory days of Hollywood when producers and directors knew instinctively that it was the story that tells the story. Running 130 minutes, quite long by 1940's standards, it zips along at a rapid pace, and Hitch, as always, keeps us guessing on the edge of our chairs. The cinematography and art direction are perfect. Why aren't more films today made in black and white? A treasure of a film of which we can honestly say, "they don't make 'em like THAT anymore!"</fullReview>

Rebecca though still has her secrets as does Maxim. Its up to the second Mrs. de Winter to see that she is not destroyed by them.

		<shortDescription>Hitchcock's analysis of the past on the present</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Rebecca' is perhaps the best exponent of a film made on a material level, as oppossed to Felleni's films for example, that explores issues concerning elements of humanity such as guilt (or lack of it) and also the factor of the past creating a voice for itself throughout Hitchcock's adaption of the novel. These issues have been explored more times than anyone would like to remember, but in 'Rebecca' they find voice through Rebecca's ever haunting and ever intrusive presence within the house. Indeed, her memory has found itself to be present in every element of the film, including the sea of course, the letters, statuette's and most importantly every character makes her return into the present. Maxim is the only break in the chain as he wants to forget his past, repress it to the deepest recesses of his mind, whereas he finds this impossible due to her memory almost controlling his future on behalf of those other characters opposed to his ideal.This film begins as a sort of fairy tale in respect to the hauntingly relevant opening shot (again recalling a memory) with its long, slow camera zoom crawling along the twisted driveway to Manderlay, all of which is shadowed by the voice of Joan Fontaine who speaks in a sad and sombre tone attributing to the kinetic effect of this scene with her own dreamy commentary.Although there are many scenes of this film that deserve great merit, and it is still mysterious to me how Hitchcock's directorial maturity and hauntingly simple visual deftness was never recognized by the Academy in terms of best director, the other immortalised scene featured in this film is that which finds the culmination of the relationship with Mrs. de Winter and Mrs. Danver's which takes place, unsurprisingly in Rebecca's bedroom. Again the memory of Rebecca creeps into reality through the cruelty of Mrs. Danver's and the symbolic representation of the sea. The effect of the presence of Rebecca from this scene on firmly roots itself into the present- I won't spoil this entirely brilliant movie more than that.This is, to put it simply, an absolutely unblemished film and in my opinion, is in no doubt Hitchcock's greatest achievement (perhaps in part due to the innocently beautiful Joan Fontaine, not that the other actors aren't great also) or in the least stands next to his other greats 'North by Northwest' and 'The lady Vanishes' - although I must admit I haven't seen some of his films. Hitchcock's use of expressionism (most notable in his earlier films) was not pioneered by him but he certainly brought it more prominence than it had with the average movie go-er. Do yourself a favour and watch this movie NOW!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If for some reason, you've read my review of Suspicion, you know that I named that movie as my favorite Hitchcock film of the 40s. I have changed my mind. Although a great movie, it simply doesn't compare to Rebecca. Fontaine's acting in both is superb, but Rebecca is much more atmospheric, and creepy.Creepiest of all is Judith Anderson in the chilling role of Ms. Danvers. George Sanders is a weaselly detestable foil for Olivier and Fontaine, but I wonder... is he the villain? Or is Anderson? Perhaps only Rebecca is the villain.Unfortunately, the plot twist didn't take me by surprise. I had already read about the film, so I knew what was coming, similar to my experience with Psycho, but it's interesting to go back and watch it through after seeing it the first time, and you see a whole new level.Too bad this is the only Hitchcock movie that won Best Picture.

Laurence Olivier's performance was acceptable (inspite of what other people say), Joan Fontaine was even nominated for Best Actress (she won it a year later for her performance on Hitchcock's SUSPICION). Judith Anderson plays the role of the dark Mrs. Danvers and George Sanders as Jack Favell (one of Rebecca's lovers). The idea of not showing Rebecca, not even in a photograph was great. Also the fact of not mentioning the name of the new Mrs. De Winter. The ending is the most unexpected part. Mrs. De Winter's expresion of suffering remains the same during the entire film and I red that Alfred Hitchcock told Joan Fontaine that everyone on the set hated her to make her feel as her character in the movie would feel. Laurence Olivier asked Hitchcock to put Vivien Leigh in the role that was later given to Joan Fontaine. Avoid all the remakes (in 1961, another in 1978 and the worst in 1997). If you are a Hitchcock fan you must take a look at this one.</fullReview>

The charming Fontaine demands your well wishes and sympathy; playing her role perfectly. Also in the cast are George Sanders, Nigel Bruce, Reginald Denny and Judith Anderson.

All is not what it seems in Rebecca, and only a director like Hitchcock could bring it out.  The cinematography ranks among the best.

Yet to see some other good Hitchcock movies like, Strangers on a Train, The Rope, Lifeboat, Shadow of a Doubt, Foreign Correspondence and Dial M for Murder.Hitchcock never won an Oscar as best director. But this was the only Hitchcock movie to ever win the Best Picture. Joan Fontain gave her best shot as a confused housewife tormented by the memories of Rebecca. One of the best acting in the film history in the role of a leading female character. I was surprised to know that Fontaine didn't win the Oscar. She won it a year later in another Hitchcock movie, Suspicion. But whoever will see both the movies, must admit that Fontaine was hundred times better in Rebecca than in Suspicion. </fullReview>

She is a bit more attractive than I had first imagined here in the novel, but her acting ability overcomes that minor drawback. Also, for the time period, I could not think of a better actor to play Maxim than Sir Laurence Olivier. Not only is he extremely talented, but he is exceptionally handsome as well. He is a perfect match against Ms. Fontaine. The first time I saw the movie, I immediately thought the young Olivier looked and acted like Cary Elwes (a great tribute to the latter!)

		<fullReview>Despite the fact that Hitchcock himself tended to be dismissive about this film (telling Truffaut, "It has held up remarkably well. I have no idea why."), REBECCA is undoubtedly one of his timeless classics - the kind of work which has become so embedded in the collective unconscious that certain scenes, lines and characters are mythic, to the point of parody (think of Carol Burnett's riffs on this story in her 1970s comedy show, or Stephen King's use of Mrs. Danvers' image in his "Bag of Bones"). This is also one of Hitchcock's great crowd-pleasers - when first released, it played in New York for a year - held over repeatedly due to audience demand - and in England the movie went through the roof, running in London for virtually the length of World War II. It's been playing constantly since then in frequent revivals and television screenings. REBECCA's production was fraught with tension and pain: principal photography started only days before the outbreak of WWII, to the great personal distress of the nearly all-English cast and crew; Hitchcock exploited Joan's Fontaine's inexperience by telling her that she was terrible and everyone hated her so as to deliberately keep her in a near-constant state of defensiveness, fear and anxiety which was 100% appropriate for Fontaine's character; and it soon became quite obvious that Selznick and Hitchcock could not stand one another and would be unable to work together in the long run. The resulting motion picture, however, brought nothing but good fortune to everyone connected with it - Laurence Olivier's long-desired Hollywood career finally took off, Hitchcock's reputation in America was secured, Joan Fontaine became an international star overnight, Selznick won his second Best Picture Oscar in a row and dominated world box-office for another year, and Judith Anderson became an icon, just for starters. This is one of those rare instances where a fantastic book was brought to the screen and made into an equally good film. Miss DuMaurier's plot is legendary: On holiday in the south of France, the untitled Cornish nobleman Max de Winter meets and marries a sweet young girl (Fontaine) whose timely attention perhaps stops him from suicide in one of the best meet-and-greets of all time. Mr. de Winter's subsequent proposal ("I'm asking you marry me, you little fool.") rescues the girl from the hell of her life as a paid companion ("I didn't know companionship could be bought," says de Winter) to the Gorgon-like American socialite Edythe Van Hopper (Played with true verve by Florence Bates: "Give me a chocolate quick!" she cries as she stubs her umpteenth cigarette out in a jar of cold cream). After a whirlwind courtship and fast Italian honeymoon, de Winter brings his bride to the ancestral estate of Manderley. The second Mrs. de Winter is not happy in her new home, which seems to be overshadowed by the presence of Maxim's first wife Rebecca, dead for some time in a boating accident. Matters are not helped by her own complete ineptitude in her new position of Great Lady, or the hostility of the housekeeper, black-clad Mrs. Danvers (superbly incarnated by Dame Judith Anderson in the only successful one-note performance in movie history), who seems to have a strange fixation on her dead mistress, keeping Rebecca's clothes, personal possessions and rooms exactly as they were during Rebecca's lifetime. De Winter himself behaves like a different man - brooding, gloomy, temperamental and even verbally abusive. Poor Joan Fontaine blames herself for her predicament, contrasting her awkward plainness with Rebecca's alleged poise, grace and popularity...After a disastrous development during a costume ball, matters seem even more hopeless when Rebecca's previously-undiscovered body turns up out of nowhere, and it seems Mr. de Winter has a lot of explaining to do...Strong plot and performances aside, this film has a truly unique atmosphere - George Barnes' Oscar-winning cinematography transforms Manderley into a Gothic symphony of light and shadow where unseen forces seem about to manifest themselves at every turn. Perhaps the greatest bit of showmanship is the way the dead, absent Rebecca becomes a major character - in the stunning and very perverse sequence ("Feel this...") where Mrs. Danvers shows the new Mrs. de Winter Rebecca's things, you can SEE Rebecca in your head while "Danny" speaks. While the film is quite long (over two hours), you won't want it to be shorter by one second! A classic for the ages which the whole family can watch and enjoy together.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of Hitchcock's finest works</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was Hitchcock first American masterpiece which marked the beginning of a new era for Hitchcock. It was the first among the string of hits he directed during 40's and 50's. And moreover this is is so different from his other movies which generally revolve around some guy trying to clear his name and someone discussing a perfect murder. I cannot understand why academy didn't award Hitchcock an Oscar for this(though the movie got one) This is the story of a young simple woman played by Joan Fontaine who falls in love and marries a widower Maxim De Winter who is the lord of Manderly . She finds herself in a awkward position of the employer in their mansion with a fleet of servants to her disposal . But she finds that everyone is still in awe with with maxim's ex-wife Rebecca and no matter what she does she cannot fill her shoes. Maxim played by Laurence Olivier is a loving husband who loses his mind easily and bursts into violent anger sometimes. He is quite convincing as a man trying to forget his dead wife and trying to move on. But the most memorable role is that of Mrs. Danvers the housekeeper.She represents Rebecca in the movie and cannot accept new Mrs. DE winter as Rebbecca's replacement. She creates a mesmerizing atmosphere with her icy looks and fearlessness.The strength of movie lies in the impeccable performances by everyone especially the scenes the new Mrs. DE winter share with Mrs. Denver's. And to compliment this is the chilly music score by Franz Waxman.Finally, one has to mention the cinematography, which is magnificent Ultimately this is a must watch for everyone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hitchcock's beginning into greatness.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is no doubt that Alfred Hitchcock was successful during his tenure as a British film maker who thrived on low-budget suspense pictures and was churning them out nearly every year. However, it was inevitable that he would find his way to Hollywood, and along with famous producer David O. Selznick, he adapted Daphne du Maurier's classic book into a thrilling and tense story about obsession, death and the effects and memories we all take with us long after someone moves onto the next world.What makes this such an interesting picture is the fact that Hitchcock was able to adapt some new and ground-breaking ideas into the filming process which obviously improves the quality of the experience as well as usher in a whole new way to create movies. He storyboarded every scene, used deep-focus photography and edited the picture "in camera," in other words only shooting what he wanted to see on the screen. This gave him a complete vision of what he wanted as well as kept the nosy Selznick's hands away from his product. What it leaves us today is spellbound, suspended and amazed at what he was able to do with a camera; in some ways 40 years ahead of its time. Though he would not receive as much credit as Orson Welles one year later with Citizen Kane, he nevertheless left behind a stirring story filled with complex and emotional people who bring us along on this strange and mysterious journey.The movie never would have been as great without an all-star cast, which Hitchcock had with Laurence Olivier and Joan Fontaine as the two lovers separated by the dead Rebecca's presence as well as supporting characters Judith Anderson as the obsessed housekeeper Mrs. Danvers and the slick and sneaky George Sanders. The narrative feels to bend a little in the final third as we are brought along to figure this dilemma out in a routine police investigation. Nevertheless, filled with dazzling images of Manderley, a completely convincing performance by the beautiful Fontaine and Hitchcock's ability to have Rebecca cast a shadow over the characters despite being dead, this is a classic not to be missed and one that needs multiple views before the mystery is cleared up. Even then, perhaps all will not be revealed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Brooding, Intense Film From the Master of Suspense.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A lot of people respect and like Alfred Hitchcock's "Rebecca" (1940), but quite a few people have one small quibble with this film, which is the lack of humour. To me, this is added virtue. Who ever heard of a dark, brooding Gothic melodrama having humour in it? This is a totally serious movie which was Hitchcock's first American movie. Thanks to the larger budget he got across the pond from David O. Selznick, he could build magnificent sets crammed with detail. The film is helped enormously no end by the cast, with a dream team that included Laurence Olivier, Joan Fontaine, George Sanders, Judith Anderson, Nigel Bruce and C. Aubrey Smith. This is one brilliant film that will have you siting on the edge of your seat.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was Hitchcock's only movie to win Best Picture. That still shocks me as he had so many good films. While I'm not sure I would rate this his best picture, there is so much to love here if you are a fan of Classic Film.There is an unforgettable opening sequence with fog and trees and crashing waves. The cinematography here is some of the finest I have ever seen. It also won a much deserved Oscar for Cinematography. There is a stunning dream sequence that is also very well done. All the filming creates the perfect mood for a Gothic tale of romance and tragedy. One thing Hitch was the best at was creating mood and tension and this movie highlights his skill perfectly. He accomplishes this through fantastic cinematography and direction that capitalizes on the use of shadows and tense angles, as well as a great mood-setting musical score. The lighting effects are also used with great skill.Fontaine is perfect as the nervous, insecure new bride. Her acting doesn't have a single insincere note in the whole of it. I understand Hitchcock helped achieve this superb performance out of a relatively young and inexperienced performer by telling her Olivier despised her because his wife, Vivien Leigh, lost the role to her. Hitch also told her the rest of the cast hated her as well. Can you imagine how insecure this would make a young, inexperienced actress? Olivier is at the prime of his physical beauty here, and does a superb job of handling the various depths of his character as they are revealed. Mrs. Danvers is enough to send shivers down your spine - what a creepy woman.Parts of the movie do seem to drag a little slow. And it seems to run long as well. But stick with it, and your interest will come back around. There are unexpected twists near the end.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After having succeeded in Europe, the master of spy films, Alfred Hitchcock was invited to Hollywood by David O. Selznick in the year 1939. This time the director reached for a novel 'Rebecca' by Daphne du Maunier. It is a story of a young woman (Joan Fontaine), who becomes a second wife of a British lord (Laurence Olivier), and his residence she meets with the cult of Rebecca. Rebecca was the lord's previous wife and she has died in very peculiar circumstances.Film cost more than a million dollars. And it was matter of conflict between the creator and the producer. But it gathered more than 10 Oscan nominees and two Oscars for the best movie and cinematography. Selznick himself was quite surprised by the piece of art. He decided to produce the movie only due to the fact that the final scene of fire reminded him of the fire of Atlanta in 'Gone with the Wind'.This master psychological thriller opened a new chapter in Hitchcock's works, making him the Hollywood's master of manipulating with mood.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK as an 18 year old I don't really watch 'old' movies. However, a friend recommended the book to me as an 'unusual ghost story' and the movie happened to be on by chance. I watched the 1st 10 minutes and I was hooked. It is a fantastic movie, completely under- rated and one I feel which will be absolutely IMPOSSIBLE to replicate today in terms of actors, atmosphere, locations and storyline. The actors were amazing (I can't stop praising them) Laurence really nailing the role as the torn lover between his guilt and love for his 2nd wife. Joan Fontaine shines as the 2nd wife, creating what appears an exciting, genuine chemistry with Laurence whilst retaining what appears like a natural sort of innocence, that makes her a joy to watch. If only their were more actresses like her today!!! The supporting cast is well presented too. With Mrs Danvers giving me the chills every time she came on screen. Poor Joan I felt so sorry for her! The suspense of this plot is what drives you to complete the movie like the 2nd Mrs de Winter (Joan) you wish to know what is wrong with Maxim (Laurence) truly.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Perfect cast for the novel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think that anyone who reads the novel carefully would agree that the cast in this movie fits perfectly the characters as described,particularly Lawrence Olivier.Some people have said that Joan Fontaine is too attractive for her role.They take the character's inferiority complex too seriously.In the book, Maxim writes to his sister describing his bride as "very pretty",and the fact that he was taken with her when he first saw her with the obnoxious Mrs.Van Hopper indicates that she was neither homely nor even plain.She thinks that Maxim invites her to have lunch out of pity after knocks over a vase of flowers,wetting her own table,but he tells her he intended to ask her anyway.Maxim is a very blunt,straightforward person,and as he says in the novel"Philantropy is not one of my strong points".She certainly was not a breathtaking beauty like Rebecca,but that doesn't mean that she was not attractive.One matter that has been much speculated about is the name of the narrator,which is never given except as "Mrs. De Winter".When they first met at the first lunch without Mrs. Van Hopper,Maxim says that she has a "lovely and unusual name". She says that her late father was a "lovely and unusual person",indicating that Maxim referred to her last name as well as her first.When he sent her a note earlier apologizing for being rude while with Mrs Van Hoppper and her,she remarked that her name on the envelope was spelled correctly,that being unusual.I think that in the author's own mind,she gave the heroine her own name, Daphne Du Maurier,an unusual(for England) and graceful name,identifying completely with the character.This movie has been criticized for not going very deeply into the characters motives,etc.Unfortunately that is what happens when you turn a long and complex novel into a two hour movie.There just isn't time,and you loose a lot.Frank Crawley,for example,described as "colorless" and "dull" at first,turns out to be a complex and interesting character,Maxim's best friend.It is a pity that the mini series was not around then.There are two faults with this movie,one minor,the other major.Manderly is described as have grace and sweep and symmetry,but the Victorian Gothic jumble of buildings shown has none.More important is the change in the nature of the death of Rebecca from murder to accident.The writers,handed this problem by the Hay's Office rule that nobody could get away with murder,didn't handle it very well.Not only is her death accidental,but it looks perfectly accidental and innocent,so there was no reason for Maxim to incriminate himself by getting rid of the body.They could have either had an accident that LOOKED like murder,ie.she falls on a marlinspike,or she shoots herself in the heart to frame Maxim,something Rebecca would be fully capable of.Movie versions of novels should be regarded as supplements to,rather than substitutions for,reading the original novel.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Some advice to the newly married..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rebecca is a very VERY densely layered drama about a newly married woman who discovers that the deceased former wife, Rebecca, still casts a VERY large shadow over the estate. While she figures out why everyone is so obsessed with Rebecca, we also find out that her husband, Mr. De Winter, also has some rather LARGE skeletons in his closet. This all leads up to a quite an awesome conclusion, where some layers are peeled off to find.. Well, more layers! This is quite an amazing little twisted tale. One of which I wasn't sure where on earth it was going, but after the De Winters get married and they move into Manderlay, the spectacular property which Mr De Winter lives on (and which Lars Von Trier named a dreadfully silly movie after) the movie then switches into high gear (and sometimes into camp, when Judith Anderson playing the wild house servant Mrs Danvers is around). Joan Fontaine and Laurence Olivier are gold here, and produce dynamite chemistry.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Overlooked Hitchcock Masterwork Remains a Classic Romantic Mystery in Wonderful Criterion Restoration</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Even though this film won the 1940 Best Picture Oscar, it does seem a shame that master director Alfred Hitchcock's adaptation of Daphne Du Maurier's classic mystery is hardly mentioned in the same breath as his later works like "Notorious", "Rear Window" or "Vertigo". I'm not sure why but it may be because at the time, it was a film more associated with David O. Selznick in the afterglow of "Gone With the Wind" than with Hitchcock who was making his first picture in Hollywood. Sixty-five years have elapsed and diminished the perception of Selznick's then-powerful influence. Suffice it to say that "Rebecca" survives as one of Hitchcock's most atmospheric masterworks, beautifully filmed by George Barnes and with two superb lead performances by Laurence Olivier and Joan Fontaine. Major credit needs to go yet again to the Criterion Collection for restoring the original beauty of the black-and-white film from a pristine print and resuscitating a clear soundtrack. The result is well worth revisiting even if you have already seen it in earlier forms.The full-blooded plot is intricately based on the way Du Maurier sets up the two main characters. At the center of the story is a na?ve, unadorned young woman working as a hired travel companion for the selfish Mrs. Van Hopper. Because of her testy employer, she ends up on the French Riviera where by chance, she meets Maxim DeWinter, a brooding, wealthy widower. DeWinter is energized by the young woman and decides to marry her on the spot. The newlyweds return to DeWinter's residence, the foreboding estate called Manderley. The young woman's insecurity is heightened by the cold housekeeper, Mrs. Danvers, who takes an immediate dislike to the new Mrs. DeWinter. Mrs. Danvers's adoration is reserved strictly for Rebecca, Maxim's first wife. At first, the new wife is completely intimidated by the manipulative Mrs. Danvers, but over time, she takes stock and becomes a more formidable presence until a revelation threatens to destroy her marriage. As the film plays itself out, the young woman discovers the real cause of Rebecca's death and gains strength in providing support for her tortured husband.In her first important role, the 23-year old Fontaine captures the right mix of deepening anxiety and innocence in portraying a woman so insecure as to not have a name in the story (she is referred to as "The Second Mrs. DeWinter" in the credits). Fresh from his equally ominous turn as Heathcliff in William Wyler's "Wuthering Heights", Olivier plays older, and it suits his polished manner much more as a well-bred man trapped by his personal demons. In a role that has been parodied endlessly ever since, Judith Anderson expertly plays the implacable Mrs. Danvers with a foreboding chill with her overly modulated tones. I do have to admit there are some moments -especially as she holds the candles near her tersely twisted face - when you almost want to laugh from the overemphasized dramatic effect.Smaller roles are filled expertly by familiar faces - George Sanders, a full decade before his acerbic Addison DeWitt in "All About Eve", plays a far more bald-faced scoundrel but with the same smarmy panache as Jack Favell; the befuddling Nigel Bruce and a relatively sympathetic Gladys Cooper expertly portray Maxim's brother-in-law and wife; and in the early going, Florence Bates makes a wonderfully wicked Mrs. Van Hopper. Once the center of the mystery has been exposed, the film does move quickly toward its conclusion running somewhat counter to the pacing Hitchcock uses in the story set-up. Regardless, many of his touches are on full display, especially the distorted camera angles and creative use of lighting. It all makes for grand entertainment.The Criterion DVD is a wonderful two-disc set with expert commentary provided by film historian Leonard Leff, the author of "Hitchcock and Selznick". It's obvious that he has studied this film intensely and come up with some golden nuggets of insight regarding the film machinations and the treatment of various plot developments. The second disc for true aficionados with an in-depth Du Maurier biography; numerous Selznick memos (for which he was most famous) on the ongoing production; more recent interviews that Leff conducted with Fontaine and Anderson; and most interestingly, archived footage of screen tests with actresses far more established than Fontaine at the time - Vivien Leigh, Loretta Young, Margaret Sullivan, a seventeen-year old Anne Baxter. Except for Baxter, who brings a touching Oedipal twist to her audition, it becomes clear how hopelessly wrong these beautiful actresses are for Fontaine's role and instead would have been ideal as Rebecca. The first disc is a must-see; the second is for devotees only.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Who are You Rebecca? ****</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Daphne Du Maurier's great book was turned into a phenomenal Oscar-winning film of 1940.By chance, a meek, timid girl, Joan Fontaine, meets the elegant Laurence Olivier, a moody individual, haunted by a deep secret. She is at a resort as a companion to the wealthy Florence Bates. Bates is quite effective as a domineering matron who loses Fontaine to the infatuated Olivier.The two marry and go back to the estate of Manderley. She meets the entire staff and is certainly unaccustomed to having things done for her. As head of the staff, Judith Anderson etched an unforgettable eerie character-Mrs. Danvers, who was totally devoted, to Olivier's first wife, Rebecca. The unusual technique of never showing who Rebecca is, is quite effective.We soon learn that Rebecca's death is suspicious. Naturally, we have George Sanders, a cousin to Rebecca, to stir up things as well as plot with Mrs. Danvers.When finally, it appears that Olivier had killed his wife, the truth emerges that even shocks the devoted Danvers. Not able to get her way, Danvers literally turns up the heat and burns down the place in an exciting ending.Though "Rebecca" was voted best picture of the year, nominees Olivier, Fontaine and Anderson (in a supporting role) came up short.A clever mystery with great performances. "Rebecca," even in death, you remain a forever mystery.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is an absolutely excellent movie. The acting is superb and the tension of the story grips you to the very end. It would be well worth anyone watching the film and enjoying the various twists and turns found in the movie. I would suggest that after watching the movie you should also read the book........but read the book only after watching the movie. Hitchcock is at his best in this one and makes use of some very good character actors. One of the things to watch in this movie is the entire lifestyle of the English characters and the way wealthy people live. It is extremely interesting to note various differences in how people react to things in a culture with class distinctions. The housekeeper in this movie is a fascinating and complex character designed after the typical English housekeeper. However, she is like no other housekeeper you'll run into. The main female lead could not have pulled this off any better than she did. The acting is superb and is so believable you find yourself forgetting its a movie. That......to me..........makes for good movie watching. Enjoy!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Utterly captivating; Fontaine and Anderson fantastic!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rebecca is a beautiful novel about suffering love, torment, and prejudice; all of which are brought superbly to life with excellent portrayals by Joan Fontaine, Laurence Olivier and Judith Anderson.The very first lines have you hooked "Last night, I dreamt I went to Manderly again" Daphne Du Maurier's own. The setting is brilliant, and the scene where you see Maxim distantly solitarly on the precipice is breathtaking. Well done, Hitchcock! Joan Fontaine was perfect for the role of the anonymous girl which is in total admiration and awe of the sophisticated gentleman Maxim de Winter (don't get me started on Laurence Olivier; he is GORGEOUS!!) and is swiftly married, much to the annoyance of Mrs Van Hopper, Fontaine's atrocious employer. Once back at the beautiful, castle-like Manderly; Fontaine (much to her tense and shy naiviety) is waited on hand-and-foot in royal manner as the mistress of Manderly. Maxim's manner cools and sharpens towards her, and she discovers that this is due to the mysterious death of the previous Mrs De Winter (Rebecca) whom people will say nothing about.Gradually, in true Hitchcock style, the mystery unfolds; and as it does so almost kills you with suspense. There is only one other talent to rival Fontaine, and that is none other than Judith Anderson as the evil Mrs Danvers... she freaks you out completely. My favourite scene is in the bedroom after the ball... Fontaine is beautifully tearful and tormented (fantastic actress, why have I never heard of her before???) and Anderson as Mrs Danvers is cruelly manipulative and wow, she is scary.Much as I adore and admire the greatest actor of all time, I think perhaps Larry (I HATE this term) hams up some of his scenes of personal torment, but for the rest of time the chemistry between him and Fontaine is lovely.So, here's the summary: Olivier is handsome and brooding, Anderson is evil, evil, evil; but Fontaine beats them all with her beautiful, poignant performance. A true masterpiece. A MUST SEE!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Have not viewed this film in many years, however, when ever I need to see a great Classic Film with great Actors and a director like Alfred Hitchcock, I can really appreciate the great films from the past and the great gift Hollywood has given. George Sanders(Jack Favell),"The Lodger",'44 plays a horrible blackmailer, who is very hateful and tries very hard to destroy Laurence Olivier(Maxim 'de Winter),"The Jigsaw Man",'83, and claims that he murdered his first wife. Judith Anderson(Mrs. Danvers),"The Red House",'47, supports Jack Favell in his efforts to break up the marriage of Maxim'de Winter and rid him of the beautiful Mansion that he lives in. Judith Anderson was a great actress and played very evil and cruel roles through out her career and was given the highest award that England could present to an actress, naming her DAME in 1959. If you look close enough, you will see Nigel Bruce(Maj.Giles Lacy),"Sherlock Holmes &amp; the Spider Woman",'44,who played a great supporting role. He was Dr. Watson in the 1940's Sherlock Holmes series. Alfred Hitchcock made this film into a masterpiece of fine acting,with great perfection, he even produced in later years a great horror picture, "Psycho", which cannot compare to "Rebecca", but the film brought in a great deal more MONEY!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A shy girl marries a rich man with a haunting past.What a product this is. There is so much talent on show from the classiest writer on the block to the best director of all time and probably the best actor of all time. It also features the classiest producer of all time, but there wasn't room for it in the sentence. Talk about a power packed movie - how could it fail? Nor did it.I am not a big fan of Gothic novels. For me they are one step above the silly, but I find they make far better films, the silliness tends to look better on the silver screen. This is a simple story. A man with a secret and girl that has to come to terms with a character that is already dead. This is where the men are separated from the boys (if you can forgive the sex change) in the literary world. Threat for the majority of writers would come from the living, only geniuses can makes the dead seem just as potent. The setting of the castle on the hill is chilling. I don't know about American's or non Europeans, but they are by their nature unnatural and sinister places. If you actually visited one for real, you would find them to be like any other home only built more sturdily. However they look terrible from the outside, in the manner of prisons. Yes there are short comings here. There is so little romance before the couple marry that it almost seems like a scene or two has been cut out. Equally many of the devices are stock and not that original: Castle, cliff top, crashing waves, the giant painting, sudden appearances out of shadows, strange people turning up out of the blue. All found under the chapter "Disorientation" in the writer's manual. Hitchcock was the best thriller director ever. He virtually invented the film thriller and I bet people watching today think that some of his films are full of clichés without realising that he was the one that invented the clichés! He knew film backwards. He knew his audience backwards. He was like a master magician: Knew all the tricks and knew how to perform them all. Only age withered him.Olivier is a strange fish on film. Started terrible, worked his way up to genius level and then slipped back to the ham. Here is trying to be older than his actual years and is not totally convincing. He is playing dour and that doesn't totally suit him. He is better with some kind of humorous undercurrent. Ronald Coleman (who turned down the part) would have been better. Indeed Larry seems to be doing an impression of him throughout.I don't rate the original novel as much as others. It has too many stock situations and too many audience pleasing motives (person growing to overcome difficult situations) to get that high marks. Call it upmarket airport pulp.The thing I like about the product is that it is not really moral in any true sense of the word. It doesn't tie up it itself up with a pink ribbon and has plenty of ambiguity. However ambiguity is not something to sniffed at. It is my favourite word and the real world is full of it.</fullReview>

The acting is okay the only actor that really stands out is Laurence Olivier who is of course considered the greatest actor ever lived. However I thought it was a bit ridiculous to see Oliver playing Maxim. Maxim is supposed to be middle aged and 21 years older than Maxim´s new wife. He was 33 when he made this film and she was 23. And plus his maid who was supposed to be scary and unplesant looked more annoying and a woman that you would like to punch in the face instead of being afraid of. Overall grade 5/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>DuMaurier &amp; Hitchcock Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A big, prestigious production from 194O. This movie had a lot going for it: a great gothic mystery best-seller by Daphne DuMaurier for its foundation, David O. Selznick as its producer, British director Alfred Hitchcock making his American directorial debut and actors perfectly suited to their roles: it really couldn't miss. And it didn't. Joan Fontaine was a most inspired choice for the shy, awkward, almost gauche young woman whose employer is a repulsive old society matron (played to the hilt by Florence Bates): she makes her mousey character charming and believable. As Max DeWinter, Olivier is sometimes surprisingly a bit wooden at times, but overall, he gives an effective portrayal as the tortured master of Manderley, the beautiful Cornish manor which is psychologically haunted by the memory of his first wife, Rebecca. A good example of the type of picture Hollywood seemingly can't make anymore, it is a masterpiece of the romantic mystery genre. In the supporting cast, Judith Anderson stands out most notably as the very intimidating Mrs. Danvers, while George Sanders, Gladys Cooper and Nigel Bruce are fine in their varied roles. It is known that Olivier was displeased that his exquisite wife, Vivien Leigh didn't quite fit the role Fontaine coveted &amp; he was unhappy during filming. The film won the AA for Best Picture of 194O: I feel that Joan Fontaine should have won for her effectively restrained portrayal of Mrs. DeWinter. Ginger Rogers won the AA for her badly dated portrayal of KITTY FOYLE instead. Pity.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of Hitchcock's more subtle films, this gem has very few of the dazzling camera angles and taut suspense pieces mostly characterized by his work -- but as a film, it's still terrific. The story begins slowly and builds itself in layers, all the more useful to make us care about the characters. Many might find the beginning too slow, as it takes nearly an hour to get to the heart of the story. But painfully slow as it is, by the time we jump into the story we are well prepared with great character development -- without it, the movie would fall flat. The basic run-through is that a woman meets a wealthy, popular man on a trip with her employer and soon begins a romance that leads to their engagement and moving to his old mansion, Mandalay. The only problem with their new union is the memories of his first wife, Rebecca, whose belongings are still strewn all over the house and whose presence is still very much felt in the mansion's caretakers -- most notably the deliciously creepy Ms. Danvers. The slightest nuance or reminder of his dead wife fills the husband with anger. Can the new wife get him to love her like he loved Rebecca? That is just the beginning of this carefully structured tale that blends all the elements together so peacefully...the movie rolls along with ease and has that "delicate" feeling. The acting is terrific. This is not a suspense film, though, so anyone expecting to see a thriller from The Master will be disappointed. The story is really nothing but a soap opera, but the way it's handled, it never feels like one. There are several suspenseful sequences still, and the great acting and characters make them work so well. Hitchcock's mansion by the sea atmosphere has a gothic, dark undertone that sends chills down the spine, helped by the sensual yet eerie music. All in all, well deserving of its best picture title. The best Hitchcock film? By no means, but far from the worst. The Master may be toned down here, but then again this story has little use for impressive camera tricks and suspense pieces. They belong somewhere else. This is a delicate story, quite different from your usual Hitchcock. And it's very good. When it starts, tell yourself to hang in there! It'll pay off.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>English Gothic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rebecca is a gorgeously mounted, opulent filming of Daphne du Maurier's runaway best-seller, and is at its core a gothic romance of a high (but not that high) order. Joan Fontaine plays the unnamed, callow young woman who fulfills what seems to be every woman's dream, which is marrying a brooding, handsome English aristocrat. As her husband, Laurence Olivier glowers nobly, and while I wouldn't say that he throws away his lines, he does give the impression that he's better than his material he's given to worth with, as indeed he is. Director Alfred Hitchcock, whose first American picture this was, is quite conservative in his approach, as this movie really "belongs" to producer David O. Selznick, who all but buried poor Hitch with his famous memos as to how he felt the film should be made. Given Selznick's exquisite taste, and the way the movie came out, his instincts were probably correct.The movie contains a secret, and here it departs considerably from the novel. I won't give it away, yet it's worth mentioning that the movie takes a turn toward the end that's such so astounding and unexpected that it actually works, making the picture surprisingly satisfying almost in spite of itself. Selznick was right after all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best Hitchcock has to offer</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the best movie Hitchcock ever directed. Laurence Olivier is, as always, superb in the role of Maxim De Winter, and Joan Fontaine is perfect as his second wife. Even with the slight variations from the book with regards to how certain events happened, it is total perfection. I haven't seen a movie yet that can compete with it. The fact that Olivier and Fontaine didn't get along at all is hardly noticeable, with the exception of the scenes where Maxim is angry at Mrs. De Winter, which in my eyes he seems to enjoy just a little too much. Judith Anderson is spectacular as Mrs. Danvers. It is her performance that makes the film great. A triumph despite the rather strained relationships between the cast and director. Highly recommended. 10 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I'm Glad He Made It</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I pretty much ignored this film when I first saw. Having gained a great appreciation for Hitchcock and having studied his films and read widely about his work, I have come to appreciate this more than some think I should. I bought a copy of the movie, but I forced myself to read the book again (it had been about 30 years, when, out of curiosity, I read it). It is a book full of wonderful atmosphere, a bit sappy in places, but has that Gothic appeal that I love. When I got the film out, I was ready, and found myself caught up in the wonderful story. Like Jane Eyre, there is that secret that becomes a part of the decay of Manderly. It can't become alive again until things have been resolved. With a masterful hand, Hitchcock delicately brings his camera around and around and peeks in the shadows, bringing threat from every corner of the mansion. I don't think the acting is average. Olivier is at his best, again, as in Wuthering Heights, standing above his ghosts. If there is a weakness, it's not in the film, but in the book. What are Olivier's motive sin marrying the girl if he was to resign her to the coldness of her new environment. How clueless was he about the hatred directed toward his young wife. Was he totally unaware that Rebecca could hold forth even in her death? Still, even though Sir Alfred didn't really like doing this film and probably butted heads with his producer, it is a work of incredible craftsmanship and when it is over, it makes one feel the great loss. Like "The Fall of the House of Usher," the cracks in the foundation are what this story is all about. If it had been made today, it would probably have brought down the characters as well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I was so disappointed.....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Its really a crime that this is the one Hitchcock film that wins best picture. It doesn't compare to 'Rear Window', 'Notorious' or 'North by Northwest'. All of the performances were excellent. Olivier was good, as this is the first movie I've seen with him. Fontaine was enchanting as the new Mrs. de Winters. Its been mentioned, but Judith Anderson as Mrs. Danvers does add a sense of dread and intrigue into the mix, and was memorable and excellent as well. The first hour of the movie I was quite interested. I found myself becoming intrigued as to what happened to the original Mrs. de Winters, and really what the big secret was with Maxim de Winters. I felt a sense of tension, and I was rather intrigued. That, of course was the first half of the movie.Then comes the second half, when we are exposed to the big secret. And let me tell you, I was not impressed. The movie, in my humble opinion, quickly changes tone. It loses its identity as a psychological thriller and becomes something less. The romance between Fontaine and Olivier quickly becomes unbelievable, as we are supposed to believe that she would still love a man such as him.(you'll see what I mean when you watch it) It loses the sense of tension and intrigue that fueled it beautifully for the first half, and comes to a screeching halt. I lost interest at that point, and by the grand finale, which I was also ill impressed with, I just didn't care anymore.I should note that I personally don't like plot twists. The most important aspect of any film, for myself, is the story. When something happens that I don't like, it weakens everything else. Its a shame here because the performances were top notch. The romance was a bit stale, nothing compared to the beauty that was 'Notorious'. This is probably the worst I've seen of Hitchcock, but luckily he gets much better than this. He is still the master, but even the master can have a bad movie here and there. I mean, Spielberg did make 'Hook'. All that said, 6 out of 10.</fullReview>

Rebecca is only mentioned by individuals who remembered her. Her ghost doesn't appear or possess anyone and yet this is consider a ghost story...which it clearly isn't.I enjoyed the movie for the most part, but also was again a little disappointed. I only rented this movie because I read online that it was a great ghost story, and I happen to love watching movies about ghost and the supernatural. Again, this movie isn't a movie about a ghost at all. I'm not saying it's a bad movie, it is fairly decent, but is very slow paced.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Chilling and dramatic- a must see for Hitchcock fans!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am 17, and I love this movie. One definite positive of Rebecca is the masterful direction by Alfred Hitchcock, full of the usual twists and turns that make his films so pleasing. The chilling and suspenseful story, of a timid young woman marrying a man and finding herself in the shadow of his dead first wife, has many complex issues, such as the possibilities of suicide, murder and mistaken identity, all of which took me completely by surprise. Rebecca also has gorgeous black and white cinematography, and a beautifully atmospheric music score. But it's the performances from the distinguished cast that holds this film together. Laurence Olivier, one of Britain's finest stage and film actors(you only have to see him in Shakespeare to know the talent this man had), gives a towering performance as Maxim De Winter, a broken man haunted by his first wife's death. The lovely Joan Fontaine is the picture of innocence and vulnerability as the 2nd Mrs De Winter, giving a genuine sense of fright and emotion throughout. Also superb is the suave George Sanders as the rather loathsome blackmailing Favel, who smirks and makes acidic remarks as effortlessly as Clark Gable did in Gone With The wind. But stealing the acting honours is Judith Anderson as the housekeeper Mrs Danvers, a performance that is truly sinister, like the scene when she sets Manderly on fire, her facial expression looking out of the window gave me the shivers. The script was tense, dark and flawlessly delivered. Through the characters we hear that Rebecca was beautiful and possessed all the other positive virtues, so I was shocked when that wasn't to be. All in all, a chilling and dark film, that is a must see. 10/10 Bethany Cox.</fullReview>

It is indeed the first of Hitchcock' masterpieces if one doesn't count his earlier British film "The Lady Vanished". One of the most memorable film characters ever is Ms. Denvers, the housekeeper who is still loyal to Rebecca. After watching this film, it is hard to forget about her extreme coldness and cruelty toward the young Mrs. DeWinter. Although this is not one of Hitchcock's most suspenseful films (most trained viewers can easily perceive how the story will turn out)it is one of his simplest and most emotional.

		<shortDescription>A melodrama told in the dark shadow of fear and tension</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A na?ve and shy young woman is staying at an exclusive but dull hotel with her guardian Mrs Edythe Van Hopper. While Van Hopper is in her room, bedridden for days with a mild cold, the girl meets "Max" De Winter ? a wealthy and influential man who she gets on with very well. Learning that he is still distraught over the accidental drowning of his first wife only makes her feel closer to him and the two bond during their drives together. When it comes time for Van Hopper to return to America, De Winter proposes and the girl gratefully becomes Mrs de Winter. Moving in with him at his Cornwall estate, Mrs de Winter cannot believe the change in her life from being barked at by Van Hopper, to now being waited on by a large staff.The idea of a marriage where the wife is constantly compared to the husband's previous wife sounded like a melodrama to me but I felt confident that Hitchcock and the assembled cast must have done something more interesting with it than just making a sentimental weepy. And indeed I was right because this has the air of a romance that turns dark, that breeds fear and develops into a mystery film of sorts. The story is twisty and very engaging and I was held by it; it does have the approach of a melodrama but it is far from that thanks to the dark air of foreboding that Hitchcock gives it. The girl's appealing nervousness is well turned in on itself by the "ghost" of Rebecca. It is done in a gripping way and when truths come out, it may head in a different direction but it is just as satisfying.The cast are pretty much all great. Fontaine dominates the first half of the film in the same way that Rebecca dominates her characters life. Throughout the film, we never know her characters first or maiden name and this helps set up a lack of strong identity that Fontaine plays off really well. Her nervous, shy girl is totally convincing and in real life I know several people like her ? people who allow themselves to be taken over by stronger characters and Fontaine did well to allow that to happen without ever having the person doing it on the screen. Olivier is powerful and makes for an interesting character throughout the whole film. Anderson has a much smaller role but has a great character and does well to support the dark air. The rest of the cast are all impressive in terms of faces ? Sanders, Bruce, Carroll, Smith, all well known people from the period and add to the sense of class the film has.Overall this is an impressive and engaging film that tells a good story with a great approach, producing a dark and interesting film that is driven by an unseen character whether the tone is melodrama, romance or mystery story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A shy insecure poor young woman (Joan Fontaine) meets rich widowed Max de Winter (Laurence Olivier). He falls in love with her and they quickly get married. He then brings her to his huge English estate called Manderley. She quickly finds out that Max can't seem to get over his first wife and the evil housekeeper Mrs. Danvers (Judith Anderson) loved the first Mrs. de Winter--and doesn't want anyone to take her place.Alfred Hitchcock's first American picture. This has always been regarded as a masterpiece but I don't really like it. It's is beautifully done with top production values (Manderley alone is stunning) and won a well-deserved Oscar for cinematography (also for Best Picture which I can't figure out). Fontaine was nominated for her wonderful performance and George Sanders and Gladys Cooper stand out in supporting roles. Also there's a STRONG lesbian subtext between Mrs. Danvers and the first wife. But that's about it for good things. Olivier is terrible in his role. He comes off as an obnoxious jerk--I kept wondering what Fontaine's character saw in him. He didn't want Fontaine in the movie (he wanted his wife Vivien Leigh) and it comes through loud and clear. The movie moves far too slow--things seem dragged out for no earthly reason. Also even though Fontaine was great her insecurity at the beginning got annoying quick. More than once I just wanted her to slap Mrs. Danvers silly.I've seen this multiple times and still can't figure out why it's so highly regarded. It's not Hitch's worst (that's "The Trouble With Harry") but certainly not his best (that's "Rope"). I give it a 5 but most people seem to love it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Yep, that's a melodrama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In kissing off her nasty, disapproving guardian (Mrs. von Hoffstetter) and improbably marrying wealthy Maxim de Winter, nameless, socially-retarded servant Joan Fontaine leaps from the frying pan into the fire. Van Hoffstetter is instantly replaced by the awful, iron-willed, disdaining housekeeper at her new estate, Mrs. Danvers; some sort of nightmare embodiment of all that's wrong and masochistic about British servitude. Not able to get over her own mousiness, Fontaine develops a fear of Danvers, and a bizarre inverted power-dynamic develops. The plot (eventually) thickens...The big revelations are hopelessly convoluted and plot-negating. Here's the final hour's worth of conflicts which all reverse themselves into pointlessness. --- Maxim can't bear to be reminded of Rebecca apparently because she was such a paragon of womanhood. Oh, but wait, he actually hated her; what a stroke of luck for our heroine! --- Someone else is buried in Rebecca's grave, meaning (gasp!), Rebecca's still alive? Nope, she's dead anyway. --- Rebecca was a conniving bitch and was provoking Maxim to kill her? Oh, but luckily, she accidentally fell and died anyway. --- Rebecca was probably pregnant making it look like Maxim killed her? Oh, but no, luckily she was full of cancer and would have died that month anyway. OH come on already! Such poor writing. One of these limp developments would have been too much. Generally, we don't go to a movie to watch dumb luck neutralize a catalog of threats in someone's life.Rebecca is unusually slow and uneventful. I've rented this three times previously, out of a sense of obligation, and fallen asleep each time, after no more than 45 minutes; and never finished it. The idle rich are shown having lots of time to be idle and fret about obscure things; pretty dull, unless you're into time-jumping, class-fantasy. I watched it recalling that the British pretty much consider their upper-class to be lunatics. I fell asleep again this time, but trudged on just to be through with it, once and for all. At the first twist, the damned thing should have ended, but there's still about an hour of reversals left! It's decidedly un-Hitchcockian except for Hitch's odd use of miniatures and rear-screen, which is becoming distracting here. A puppet of Mrs. Danvers closing a tiny window is unconvincing even at the scale of TV. This is a dull, clumsy, overlong melodrama with tedious, long-delayed segments devoted to exposition. There's also a costume ball; a bankrupt cliché if there ever was one. Rebecca is a bad movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I still have no idea why people like this movie so much. The acting is poor, particularly that of Olivier. He comes across as overacting terribly. Miss Fontaine fares better. She, at least, gives us a decent performance. Anderson is completely not to be believed. The music is so overdone it makes you wonder what they were thinking by putting it in there so much. This movie is just waiting to be parodied (as it has been). And then there's the ending when this turns into a movie in search of an editor. Every time you think it might be over it goes on for ten more minutes. Then, is it over? No, it just rambles on and on until you want to strangle whoever is playing that awful music. It should be noted that this movie has more of Selznick in it than Hitchcock. After making this film Hitch began to try and get every other studio in Hollywood to hire him out so he wouldn't have to work with Selznick again. He even makes fun of Selznick with smug jokes in later movies. I can see why. If somebody took my movie and put in that music and let it ramble on forever I'd be mad at them, too. There is a good idea for a film in here somewhere, but this isn't it. I hope all the people who voted this the best picture of 1940 were given a nice padded cell. I was planning to write more, but just thinking about this movie is making me cringe, so I'll just stop. If you like good movies, see many other Hitchcock classics, but leave this one on the shelf.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Last night I dreamt of a shorter film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think the first half hour with Mrs. Van Hopper should have been condensed into ten or fifteen minutes-- where we get to know Max, but most of it is compressed into a long montage. As it is, some of those scenes, while charming, were overly long-- and the action really doesn't start until they are on their way to Manderley. At Manderley, I felt that we were getting to know the house and the background of Rebecca's life there in bits and pieces, but it was very stretched out. I looked at the clock, and the discovery of the boat and the other body does not happen until the 80 minute mark. Most motion pictures are winding down at 80 or 90 minutes-- but in this case, the film is just reaching its turning point. The last half-hour, when we have Favell's blackmail scheme and where we find out whether or not Rebecca was pregnant is truly the most compelling, plot- driven portion of the movie. Then the ending with Danvers going mad is the most dramatic, climactic part. This film could easily have been trimmed by thirty or forty minutes and it would have been just as good. What we have in this form, is producer David Selznick forcing Hitchcock to aid him in indulging in continuous atmosphere and a padded story that is meant to be big and shout masterpiece. It is definitely a masterpiece, but it could have been streamlined in parts and been a lot more compact without compromising any of its value.</fullReview>

The fabric is broken somewhat by George Sanders appearing to do his usual bored aristocrat act, but that's a small quibble. The reliable Gladys Cooper and C Aubrey Smith appear in tiny roles.The film is never boring, and even though it stretches and changes its source material in places, it does a good job of making a movie out of Daphne du Maurier's novel.

		<fullReview>***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** Black and white, award-winning REBECCA is a fine, engrossing film. It starts with "Last night, I dreamt I went to Manderley again." I saw it on DVD, the recently issued special edition, borrowed from my local library. For me is was an opportunity to see Laurence Olivier as 'Maxim' de Winter and Joan Fontaine as the "new" Mrs de Winter who has no first name, two great actors that I knew virtually nothing of. The first Mrs had died about a year before this film begins, in southern France, where the young lady sees Max on the edge of a cliff apparently thinking of jumping, and we don't know why.some SPOILERS follow, read further at your own risk, because these are comments for my recollection.In Monte Carlo Max courts the young (early 20s)woman quickly, asks her to stay and marry him rather than go to New York with the old woman she assists. She does, is taken home to Manderly which is his home, a large mansion/castle with servants. (The film Gosford Park is good to help understand the service structure involved here.) She is young, timid, and at a loss for how to be "Mrs de Winter" in this setting.She gradually learns about the deceased Mrs and finds that in most respects she was not very well liked. As it turns out Max had found out she was having an affair with her cousin, thought she was pregnant with her cousin's child, and instead of living with the knowledge that his fortune would be inherited by a bastard child, he killed her and sank her in her boat, identifying a different found body as his wife's. The new Mrs de Winter was much more what he had in mind for a companion.Things take a twist when the sunken boat is found, and containing the real deceased Mrs. An inquest reveals she was not pregnant, but was dying from cancer, which gave her a motive for the suicide that Max claimed. Max is off the hook, but he had told his new Mrs the truth and that would be theirs.Good, engrossing movie, but for my tastes don't see why it gets such great respect as a classic. I guess I have a problem with people getting off with bad things, similar to the story in CHINATOWN.</fullReview>

So this is far better.My favorites are "Shadow of a Doubt," "Notorious," and "Strangers on a Train." And "North By Northwest."But it is a bodice-ripper. It's awfully corny in many ways. Olivier's seeming uninterest in Fontaine makes sense in the early parts but once The Secret has been revealed and they speak to each other in Hushed Tones, he seems no more interested.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Given the huge acclaim and having enjoyed many of Hitchcock's other works, I really was looking forward to 'Rebecca'. The film starts with widower Maxim pursuing Fontaine's character which leads to marriage. The early sequences are full of clichés and bad acting especially by Olivier. From the marriage point, then on Hitchcock successfully sets an atmospheric tone once the viewer is introduced to Manderlay. The cinematography and lighting is brilliant. Though Rebecca is dead, even the viewer feels her looming presence that suffocates the second Mrs. De Winter. Consequently, her marriage to Maxim is on the rocks.However, after the sequence where Rebecca's body is discovered in a sunken boat, the movie goes rapidly downhill. There writing gets very shoddy as it changes into a contrived murder mystery with too many inconsistencies. Even the cute Joan Fontaine's Mrs. De Winter loses bearing (just like the plot). At this point I got so tired that I was desperately hoping for the closing credits to roll. Fontaine was excellent as the naive pushover bride up until this aforementioned turn of events when the character loses focus. Laurence Olivier overacts. But, it is Judith Anderson who steals the show as the intimidating Mrs. Danvers.I don't understand why 'Rebecca' is recognized as one of his most accomplished work. To me it is far from Hitchcock's best. It's his worst of what I've seen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A wonderful thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So far the Alfred Hitchcock's films never let me down. Certainly this as well. Quite different from his other films, Rebecca contains no violent blood scare scene at all. But what makes Alfred Hitchcock talent is we can feel the tension atmosphere all through the film (the housekeeper's eyes to the girl, the weird west room, the sign tune of Hitchcock....). Joan Fontaine does a great help to the film as the The Second Mrs. de Winter. We have to mention without Judith Anderson (Mrs. Danvers),we can hardly imagine how it will to be. The film is really perfect until The Second Mrs. de Winter know all about Rebecca in the cottage. The after portion doesn't fully close to the beat of the film(Maybe director must make it a 2-hour-film to satisfy the company)After all,as a film won Best Cinematography &amp; Picture in 1941 Oscar. It enjoy me much tonight*******/**********</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This excellent and moody film by novelist Daphne Du Maurier, under the masterful direction of Alfred Hitchcock won a best picture Oscar in an era of great pictures. Laurence Olivier is brilliant as the somber, brooding Max De Winter, and Joan Fontaine epitomized vulnerability as Mrs De Winter. Judith Evans was daunting as the sinister housekeeper, Mrs. Danvers and George Sanders brought a fresh presence as the cousin of the late and lamented Rebecca. The black and white feature is dark an mysterious and perfectly suited to the story. Hitchcock would go on to make many other excellent thriller and mystery stories, but to my mind none of them hold a candle to this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My lifelong obsession</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is *THE* movie that turned me into a movie fan, specifically in the genres of Gothic horror and psychological thrillers. I was 11 years old in 1973, and my sisters were watching the Brady Bunch. I escaped to my parents room and the small B&amp;W TV that received only four channels. Fortunately for me, one of those stations was the local PBS affiliate, and they were airing Rebecca.There's a lot to be said for a movie of this complex intensity that can keep an 11-year old in fascinated rapture for hours. At that time, I didn't catch the name of the movie, and I only knew Alfred Hitchcock from the syndicated reruns of his TV series. Some years later I was discussing movies with my then girlfriend and her brother, and I described the plot of the most captivating movie I had ever seen, but whose title I couldn't remember. Her brother immediately said, "That's Rebecca by Alfred Hitchcock." We rented it that night and the memories of why it grabbed me so hard the first time I saw it came flooding back. From that day forward I have been nearly compulsive about collecting Hitchcock movies, documentaries and just about any psych thriller I can get my hands on.If you are on this site, it's likely that you're already a movie fan, but check out Rebecca and it could bring your interest in movies to a whole new level.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mr. de Winter, a hard, damaged bachelor of high-class sentiments meets a lovely and whistful girl, immediately falling in love with her and taking her away from her insane career to marry her and live with her in Mandalay. However, there's a ghost in Mandalay... just not the type of ghost you'd be expecting.This is straight-up Gothic drama in all the Edgar Allen Poe sense of the word, but most deliciously it's some very biting dark comedy. It's just so wonderfully perverse watching these damaged characters haunt their own spaces and creep around like sludge from the hollows.I have to say I've enjoyed this movie much more than I've enjoyed a lot of Hitchcock's works. I don't know precisely what it is but Hitchcock doesn't do it for me sometimes. Near the end of this movie the plot does go into what I'd call "typical Hitchcock mode", which kind of damaged the movie a bit for me but not enough for me to lower its rating any. It's kind of like how the end of AI could be dropped completely from the plot and we'd end up with a good movie, only the ending of this movie doesn't retrospectively damage the quality of the movie as a whole... it just sort of lets it peeter out a bit.At any rate, it was absolutely lovely, with characters with a bit more on their mind than just, oh, I don't know... running away from the law or whatever. It's wonderfully felt and wonderfully presented, making the entire thing feel more magical.By the way, is it just me or do a few scenes of this movie remind me of scenes from Citizen Kane and Disney's Beauty and the Beast? --PolarisDiB</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Rebecca' based on the Gothic novel by Daphne Du Maurier is the great Alfred Hitchcock's first American film. Ironically, it's more British than his British work is, and the great thing about it is that it brings out the spirit of the novel, as opposed to being typical Hitchcock work.What a cast! Laurence Olivier (my fave actor and god) as the sardonic Maxim de Winter, Joan Fontaine as the second Mrs de Winter, George Sanders as the blackmailing cadish Jack Favell, Judith Anderson as the evil Mrs Danvers, Reginald Denny as the faithful Frank Crawley, Gladys Cooper as Mrs Lacey, Nigel Bruce as Mr Lacey, there are several others but we will be here forever if I name them all. But what I am trying to say, EVERYONE in the cast is just so brilliant, you cannot single one out as a best performance when all these talented actors all give it their 100% best.The plot is done straightforwardly and not in the slightest bit difficult to understand, about a man who has been widowed for over a year, marries a young nervous girl and brings her to his mansion. however, the memory of Maxim de Winter's first wife 'Rebecca' who was loved by everyone but was a cruel, spitefull, shallow rebellious woman, is constantly kept alive by the sinister housekeeper Mrs Danvers (why Judith Anderson never won the Best Supporting Actress Oscar for this I'll never know), the new wife and Maxim have to constantly battle against the dead Rebecca's popularity and it is a real scary journey for them, it's an alliance between a gawky virgin and a widowed sadist, a woman who's past is so blank that she doesn't even possess a name and a man who's past is so dark and horrible that he has contemplated suicide. You might find it a bit weird first time when you watch it, but honest to god, if you enjoy all genres of film, you will love this. As I said before, it is stupid to single out someone for giving the best performance in this film, but I suppose the one who commands your attention the most overall has to be Judith Anderson as Mrs Danvers. Perfect settings, perfect costumes and a perfect film. I have no issues with this film at all. I am now reading Daphne du Maruier's novel and am enjoying that too. The novel is loosely inspired by Charlotte Bronte's Jane Eyre, Joan Fontaine played Jane eyre in a 1944 production of Bronte's novel with Orson Welles but was nowhere near as good in that as she is in this. However, back to the point, great great film. Please watch it when you can, you will love it. Enjoy.*Laurence Olivier was immensely rude to Joan Fontaine and caused her weeks of misery during filming. Why? He was p*ssed of the Vivien Leigh (his then wife) didn't have the part and took it out on Fontaine. When she informed of her recent marriage to actor Brian Aherne, he spat back 'Can't you do any better than him?' I'm surprised he wasn't hit.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hitch comes to Hollywood</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alfred Hitchcock's first Hollywood movie won Best Picture and Cinematography (unfortunately, he didn't take home a Best Director Oscar). "Rebecca" portrays widower Max de Winter (Laurence Olivier) and an unnamed woman (Joan Fontaine) getting married. But on their honeymoon, she discovers that the memory of Max's first wife is apparently haunting him in multiple ways. And servant Mrs. Danvers (Judith Anderson) isn't exactly what she seems.The possible common Hitchcock theme that one can see in this movie is the murderous gays: there's the possibility that Mrs. Danvers is a lesbian. I don't know whether or not Hitch was a homophobe, but one can see the theme. Either way, "Rebecca" remains a classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hitchcock does a typically superb job of dark suspense with an already compelling Du Maurier novel. This film is also notable as a period piece, capturing a niche of society in fascinating and witty detail. However it is, most of all, a damn fine thriller that one can watch again and again.Hitchcock remains faithful to the original novel (note that in the book, for example, the central character is never named); while "Rebecca" never appears as a character in the film and yet holds a magnetic power over the entire cast despite her absence. This is a fascinating device that works with dark magic throughout the film. Enjoy!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you are into scary movies, this is the best. My mom was jumping every five seconds and finally left after screaming her head off! I guess this is a spoiler--in a way, about the dress. The dress Mrs. Danvers convinced Joan Fontaine to wear--it was rather predictable. So, that is sort of a spoiler. Anyway, it was really creepy, and (another spoiler if you didn't see it) Mrs. Danvers' face in the end was REALLLYY creepy. But did you notice that Joan Fontaine is credited as "the second Mrs. DeWinter, and she doesn't have a first name. Mr. DeWinter just calls her "dear" or "darling." She doesn't have a name, because it is overshadowed by the first Mrs. DeWinter. CREEPY MOVIE ALERT! This movie is not rated, because it is so old, but I would rate it PG-13 for disturbing images.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My mother's favourite book and film were these, and when I was growing up in the 1960s and '70s we had many conversations about them. Jack Favell seems to be a male version of Rebecca, who hates Maxim out of envy partly, but also because he loathes or is bored by most people -- similar to the way that Rebecca felt, we are led to believe. I think that this is particularly the case since Rebecca and Jack are not from the same socio-economic stratum as Maxim, who ultimately had the most material resources of all the characters. Jack is, in a way, an embodiment of Rebecca, as Danvers is, and he is obsessed with Rebecca, as most of the major characters are except the more stable Bee, Giles, and Frank.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Daphne du Maurier and the actresses carry the film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hitchcock's cinema has always been propped up by a good novel, play or script. His cinematic flourishes embellished these materials with a remarkable intuition of how viewers would react to his treatment of the written material.The real genius of the film "Rebecca" will remain with the author du Maurier. Hitchcock's treatment of the story was to change the end of the story to make the leading man appeal to the audiences. Daphne du Maurier's murderer is transformed by Hitchcock into a tragic hero. That's what American audiences wanted in the Forties and want even to this day. Hence the film gets the Best Picture Oscar and other Oscars. But even with the changed ending, the story is great. In the book, the lead characters go on to live their lives after Manderlay burned down in another far way place.This film has all the ingredients that go down well with most audiences?two superb performances (Joan Fontaine as the second Mrs. de Winter and Dame Judith Anderson as the housekeeper with lesbian attachments) and the realistic special effects that recreated Manderlay within the studio. If people were wide-eyed at the performance of Olivier in this film, I suggest they see a British film called "A Term of Trial" directed by Peter Glenville, which has a story with quaint similarities to Olivier's role in "Rebecca" to see the thespian at his best.What is Hitchcock's contribution beyond the fine performances of the ladies? He was able to capture the sinister quality of Manderlay (just as the house of the murderer in "Psycho") in the opening sequence through spoken words and visuals and the burning of Manderlay at the end by light on the faces of people viewing the spectacle. He was probably aware that the basic material of du Maurier was the flip side of "Blackmail," one of his early films with a gender reversal. He was probably thinking of reworking elements of "Rebecca" in "Suspicion" a film he made 3 years later."Rebecca" might have won awards but in terms of cinema it pales in comparison with four Hitchcock films "Notorious," "Saboteur," "Sabotage," and "Blackmail." Interestingly, this is a rare Hitchcock film that presents women who gain in strength ?other rare examples being "Marnie" and "Spellbound."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rebecca</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was the most popular film from Oscar nominated director Sir Alfred Hitchcock at the cinema, but most would think it was Psycho! It starts with Oscar nominated Joan Fontaine (known only as The Second Mrs. De Winter) shouting at rich widower Maxim De Winter (Oscar nominated Lord Sir Laurence Olivier) when he is stood near the edge of a cliff, looking ready to jump. They see each other again at the near hotel, and after a little while she is desperate to see him again, and accepts his idea of marriage. She is then whisked with him to his house in Cornwall, Monte Carlo, called Manderlay. As she spends more time trying to get used to the "high" life, she is almost stalked by the creepy (most have thought she was lesbian) house keeper, Mrs. Danvers (Oscar nominated Judith Anderson), who is part of Fontaine's breakdown and thought that Maxim still cannot let go of his recently deceased wife, Rebecca. When she does accuse him of this, he reveals that he hated her, and soon enough the concluding scenes turn into an investigation as to whether Rebecca was murdered in her boat, or accidentally drowned. The final scenes see Maxim and Fontain pretty much back together, and they watch the evil Mrs. Danvers disappear into the fire of the house. Also starring George Sanders as Jack Favell, Nigel Bruce as Major Giles Lacy, Reginald Denny as Frank Crawley, C. Aubrey Smith as Colonel Julyan, Gladys Cooper as Beatrice Lacy, Florence Bates as Mrs. Edythe Van Hopper, and Hitchcock's cameo is the man who walks near the phone booth just after George Sanders makes a call. Some good acting, a lot of mystery, and a good director adapting the novel by Daphne Du Maurier, a great classic. It won the Oscars for Best Picture and Best Cinematography, and it was nominated for Best Art Direction, Best Special Effects, Best Film Editing, Best Music for Franz Waxman and Best Writing, Screenplay. Sir Alfred Hitchcock was number 75 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons, Lord Sir Laurence Olivier was number 21 on The 50 Greatest British Actors, he was number 3 on Britain's Finest Actors, he was number 14 on 100 Years, 100 Stars - Men, and he was number 4 on The World's Greatest Actor, Mrs. Danvers was number 31 on 100 Years, 100 Heroes &amp; Villains, the film was number 80 on 100 Years, 100 Thrills, and it was number 73 on The Ultimate Film.

		<fullReview>This movie is based on my favorite book. Joan Fontaine is excellent as the young bride, although the character annoyed me with all her crying. Laurence Olivier shines as Maxim de Winter. He is the perfect person to play the handsome, tortured widower. George Sanders is also perfect as Favell, combining both humor and menace to build a memorable character. When watching the film, it's easy to tell why this won the Oscar for Best Picture. The only problem I had w/this movie is the fact that they changed Rebecca's death. In the book, Maxim kills her. In this, he does not. She trips and hits her head. I liked the book version better. This was the only problem I had w/the movie.This is definitely a recommendation for anyone who loves the book, Hitchcock, Olivier, or movies. You won't be disappointed.</fullReview>

It was made almost 70 years ago and a master craftsman made it but for me its just a reasonably good creation. I well remember watching it for the first time and when the film ended I felt as if there was something major that was missing or not well done. I have never really lost that feeling in all of the viewings since and unfortunately I have never satisfactorily figured out why it doesn't seem right. It isn't the setting or the fact that the film was made in black and white or the actors and actresses who were involved in its making, however, the actress who plays Mrs Danvers was superb and well worth watching just to see her performance and I have not read the book therefore I am not aware if it is a fair representation. Whatever it is that is not right about the film is all the way through. I know that a lot of people really like this film and when I come across someone who does like it and why I will hopefully find out why I don't. Anyway I would still recommend anyone watch this film because as I have previously said a master craftsman made it and whatever it is that doesn't sit right its probable that its just me so please watch it and make your own mind up.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>... are all sadly lacking from what has to be one of the most overrated films that ever came down the pike. Having considered both Hitchcock and Olivier vastly overrated almost all my life I had no problem avoiding this one when it occasionally surfaced on television but recently it was given away with a newspaper and so eventually I stuck it in the DVD and tried to give it a fighting chance to justify the hype surrounding it. I've seen about 90-95% of Larry Olivier's films and found them mostly ho hum but here he hits a new low worthy of Emil Jannings or Charles Laughton at their worst. Displaying neither charisma nor charm he is nevertheless able to sweep an ultra naive Joan Fontaine off her feet and repair with her to his Gothic manse where the memory of his first wife, Rebecca, is all-pervasive not least with the Gale Sondergaard-lite housekeeper Mrs Danvers (Judith Anderson). About half the 'English Colony' - UK actors domiciled in Hollywood - pop up in an attempt at 'local color' so trivia buffs can have a field day looking out for C. Aubrey Smith, Gladys Cooper, Nigel Bruce et al. Keeping up the Hollywood end Florence Bates weighs in with a well-observed harridan in the opening reel and Joan Fontaine walks away with the 'acting' honors just by being herself. The pseuds love it so who am I to cry 'the king has no clothes on'.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An opaque, writhing, ghostly - engrossing - thriller.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A fine film which sustains suggestions posted on this site that it ranks amongst Hitchcock's masterpieces. There are a number of sequences which surely blossomed into important elements of Vertigo: a vertiginous opening (disaster as potential); romance with a mysterious partner against a tragic background; the tension of the naive protagonist's curiosity bringing her (in this case) into conflict with the other characters. In fact, on this last issue, not only is there an issue of Maxim not wanting his second wife to dress as his first (as, conversely, Scottie wants to Judy recreate Madeleine's dress) but in fact the costume ball dress bears more than a passing resemblance to Carlotta Valdes' portrait dress in Vertigo.The masterstroke of the film comes in a further comparative: the absence of a chief protagonist. Just as Madeleine barely exists and is pursued by Scottie throughout Vertigo, so Rebecca is dead for the whole of this film and never shown either in picture or flashback. Her actual character is elusive as well, concealed with a host of well-drawn shady types with their own secrets and neuroses. Thus Rebecca becomes as strange and fearful as the alien, inhuman evil of Melville's Claggart or Shakespeare's Iago. A true Dea ex Machina.Helping to create this situation is - principally - de Maurier's novel which I can't imagine is diminished in Hitchcock's carefully rendered account. For the director, Olivier is a slightly affected but ever-watchable tortured soul, not hugely removed from his Heathcliff of the previous year. Above all though is the fresh, touching '2nd Mrs. de Winter' of Joan Fontaine. She's beautiful, vulnerable but not pathetic, vibrant and believable in every event. She is extraordinarily modern. The subordinate parts are taken well-enough: I particularly like the Stygian Mrs Danvers (albeit played as an auterial puppet by Judith Anderson) whose relationship with Rebecca hints at an exclusively feminine bond - further, uncomfortably alien circumstances to spook the audience.However it is testimony to Hitchcock's success with this film that Fontaine can make such an impression and yet bear no name of her own: the film truly is about the noumenal Mrs de Winter the first - Hitchcock, in the final analysis, has remained entirely in control. 7.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hitchcock's 1941 Best Picture Starring Fontaine &amp; Olivier</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>London, England's 'notorious' director of psychological thrill, suspense, mystery &amp; drama films, Sir Alfred Hitchcock (8.13.1899-4.29.1980), was nominated for 5 Oscars: "Rebecca" (1940), Hitchcock's 1st US motion picture, earned his 1st directorial Oscar nomination &amp; won the 1941 Oscar for Best Picture. Thus, began the history of acclaim for Hitchcock's remarkable career as a motion picture &amp; television show director. Both of "Rebecca's" lead actors, Sir Laurence Olivier ('Maxim' de Winter) &amp; Joan Fontaine ('Madam' de Winter), were nominated for Oscars, as well. Original music by Franz Waxman provides a combination of eerie, erotic, moody &amp; emotive orchestration effects. George Barnes won "Rebecca's" 2nd Oscar for Best Cinematography in Black &amp; White.Novelist Daphne Du Maurier's plot certainly wouldn't work nearly as well without the spooky head housekeeper of the de Winters' castle, Manderley: Mrs. Danvers (Judith Anderson). Danvers entered Manderley with Rebecca (de Winter), Maxim's first wife who left him a widower &amp; left Danvers obsessed with her. The nearly unspoken memory of Rebecca is the haunting aspect that Hitchcock expertly raises from the dead throughout this film to its magnificent end. Fontaine &amp; Olivier deliver superb starring performances of Du Maurier's novel's protagonists through Philip MacDonald's &amp; Michael Hogan's adaptation and Robert E. Sherwood's &amp; Joan Harrison's screenplay. The two fall in love on vacation in Monte Carlo, marry &amp; return to Maxim de Winter's castle on a craggy coastal cliff in England. Fontaine's Mrs. de Winter is young, unassuming &amp; constantly feels out of place due to Danvers' psychological torment by comparing Maxim's new wife with his dead one. Danvers contrasts Rebecca's perfection to the newlywed's shortcomings. Fontaine's Madame de Winter is led to believe that everyone was "enchanted" by Rebecca, even as she knows of her own plain, unpretentious simplicity. The historical atmosphere of Rebecca seemingly shrouding Manderley has the effect of nearly driving Fontaine's de Winter nuts. Before the true mystery of Rebecca is revealed, a shipwreck near Manderley forces Maxim to tell his new wife the truth about Rebecca. That's when everything the film builds the audience up for starts to unfold. Unlike so many psychological suspenses, Hitchcock's delivers a grand flood of surprises &amp; unpredictable twists up to the very end.A note of interest: 9 of Hitchcock's motion pictures still rank in the top 250 today on IMDb.com. "Rebecca" is currently #75. An astounding 5 Hitchcock films are ranked in the top 100! No other actor, director, producer or any other contributor of works to motion pictures comes close to ranking as consistently high for the span of a century as Sir Alfred Hitchcock. Though Sir Ian McKellen comes close with 3 films in the top 100 &amp; rated by over 400,000 viewers' votes!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having seen almost all of Mr Hitchcock's films except this one it seemed time to catch up with the one many people reckon as one of his best. Well, what can I say? It is fine. Interesting from time to time and with the prowling Danvers and developing mystery, one's interest is just about held. I have several problems with the film, not least with the two leads but I think that for me the real problem is that this is not so much Hitchcock's film as that of the all powerful and at that time all involving Mr Selznick. Given more of a free reign, I would have expected Olivier to be replaced if he could not get himself a little more involved in the proceedings and not to have had Joan Fontaine play her role so meekly (and dowdily!). Most of the action at Mandelay is good and creepy but we seem to gain little from the early scenes, supposedly showing us the couple's love blossom. I also felt that the almost comic cops at the end took away what edge the director had managed to engender. Perhaps if the whole film had been confined to the house the Hitchcock shadows and menace could have helped sustain a more sinister feel throughout. Ah well, very watchable if minor Hitchcock.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not that this movie is horrible but it just also doesn't exactly lives up to its reputation. This is not the only Hitchcock movie with this problem and even though I absolute love most of Hitchcock's movies and he was an absolutely brilliant and a one of a kind director, he doesn't get a critical free pass from me. Needless to say this movie disappointed me even though it had plenty of redeeming qualities, which in the long run still makes this a perfectly good movie.Problem to me is the movie its story and then especially the pace its being told in. Mostly the middle part of the movie is just a complete bore. Nothing interesting or mysterious enough is happening in it. From an Hitchcock movie you would at least expect some suspense but there is actually very little of that present here. You can say that this movie is not really being enough 'Hitchcock' like. Perhaps this was because this was Hitchcock's very first Hollywood movie and he was kept more on a short leach by the studio's and the movie its producers?A redeeming quality is the movie its last halve hour or so, when your whole view of the movie its main character suddenly changes when you learn about the truth. You really don't like sympathize for the man at first but once you know what really happened this suddenly all changes for you and he becomes actually a tragic character you start to care for.The movie is also being innovative by using some real dynamic and experimental camera-work at times, as you basically always can expect from an Hitchock movie. It also makes good use of miniature and while watching this movie I couldn't help wondering if this movie didn't somewhat inspired "Citizen Kane". Some of the effects and camera handling seems to be the same and of course the Manderlay estate can also be seen as Xanadu, you don't need a lot of imagination for that.The movie tries to create a good dark and mysterious atmosphere but when there is not an awful lot happening in the movie, atmosphere is not really enough to make a movie with. It suits the movie that its being shot in black &amp; white and all but the atmosphere is just not as good, moody and horror Gothic like as everyone tries to make you believe it is. The story just simply doesn't allow this.The movie has a typical solid '40's cast, with popular actors such as Laurence Olivier, Joan Fontaine and popular supporting actors such as George Sanders, Nigel Bruce and Gladys Cooper involved. It was especially nice to see Laurence Olivier in an Hitchcock movie, two Hollywood legends working together. The acting is overall good in this movie though it tends to become a bit overly melodramatic at times.Give credit where credit is due. This is a good movie but no way a classic, or among Hitchcock's best work. Oh well, seems that just not a lot of people agree with me on this, also considering that this movie won an Oscar for best picture in 1941. It won as well for its cinematography by George Barnes and was nominated in 9 more categories.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Good Example of Fine Film Making -As Good As It Got Back Then</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not nearly as thrilling as I was expecting, today's movies have come so much further with script writing, actors are more natural, sets more spectacular, etc.The lighting was gorgeous and quite breathtaking at times, but it seemed to me more of an education in film making as it was done back then. The old scenic backdrops were fun to see, but obviously artificial. While Joan Fontain was adorable, Lawrence O'livia was far too stiff for me to get comfortable with his character. The gal that played the gustapo type housekeeper was way over the top. She looked like something out of the silent film era. All very interesting, but not totally satisfying for me. Not what I expected.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Renowned Hitchcock Film Is a Bit of Bore</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was expecting big things from "Rebecca," Alfred Hitchcock's Best Picture Academy Award winner from 1940, and I was disappointed. Give me "Foreign Correspondent," Hitchcock's other 1940 release and fellow Best Picture nominee, any day."Rebecca" starts out promisingly enough, as a Gothic ghost story about a naive young woman (Joan Fontaine) recently married to a wealthy aristocrat (Laurence Olivier) who finds herself competing with his dead wife, a woman whom Fontaine mentally builds into an image of female perfection until the memory of her almost becomes a physical presence in the house. But the mystery departs the film around the three-quarters mark, and the enigmatic spell of the movie goes with it. Fontaine and Olivier are two limp noodles at the film's center, and it falls to Judith Anderson, playing the mysterious and creepy housekeeper who fostered an irrational love of her former mistress, to keep things alive.The production design and black and white cinematography look stylish, but the film doesn't give Hitchcock the opportunity to impose any of his playful directorial signatures on it. As a result, it's a bit of a bore.Grade: B</fullReview>

		<fullReview>We know that Mrs. Danvers was in love with Rebecca, the question is was Rebecca involved sexually with Mrs. Danvers? Hitchcock made pointed references to the fact the Rebecca was often a cold and sexually unresponsive wife . There is the assumption that Rebecca was at least bi-sexual. To really appreciate the subtlety of this film it helps to factor in this possible relationship between the women. Hitchcock working under the censorship code of the time could only hint at it. However, with this in mind, one doesn't have to look hard to connectthe dots. Rebecca is wonderful story telling with a first rate cast and is beautifully photographed. One of the classics from Hollywood's golden age.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is pretty much a disgrace to the book. It has terrible dialogue, music, and is very, very boring, not even in such a way that leaves you to hope for a climax, or some kind of abstract moral or psychological meaning, but in a way that makes you claw out your eyes with frustration that a movie can be so terrible.It is baffling to think that this won an Oscar, and just because you have a pretty face doesn't mean you make a movie good. And I'll add that the character of the 2nd Mrs. DeWinter is supposed to be dreadfully boring because she is supposed to be of no consequence at all. What a terrible letdown after reading the book.The only thing gloomy about the movie is that it actually exists.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderful Visuals, But A Big Yawner Overall</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This review won't be accepted gracefully on this website but at least I am honest in telling you this was a big disappointment to me, considering all the great reviews I read (not here) prior to seeing it. Some of that praise is simply because it's an Alfred Hitchcock movie with "Hitch" being a big favorite among national critics.Even though I own a good amount of classic films, this was way too slow, way too corny and old-fashioned. I should re-purchase this film and use it the next time time I have trouble getting to sleep at night.Joan Fontaine has a nice, pretty wholesome face but that's about it. Her character in this was just plain stupid and got worse as the film wore on, especially at the end. Judith Anderson, whom I read was so "creepy" in this, was not anywhere near as evil as built up to be. As usual, the real-life wacko, George Sanders, is the most interesting actor in the film.Having said all that, I do want to highly praise the sets and camera effort of this movie. The best part of this melodrama was the cinematography with some wonderful scenes inside "Mandaly" (the mansion). The cameras did a great job with the use of shadows, some of the best I've ever seen. Without the visual treats, I doubt I could have stayed with this 130-minute film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good - But Nowhere Near Hitchcocks Best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alfred Hitchcock, in my opinion, is the greatest director America has ever seen, and yet he has never won the Oscar for Best Director, but he did make one movie that won Best Picture. That picture was a Rebecca. However, I am sad to say, this film is not Hitchcock's best. In fact, of the Hitchcock films that I have seen, this is the worst. Oh the irony. But, being as good as Hitchcock is, this does not mean that this is a bad movie.The beginning of Rebecca is atrocious. The acting sucked, the direction was nothing special, and the dialogue took us nowhere. We feel like we are watching some cheesy romantic movie written by a 16 year old girl, and directed by some Hollywood jackass. We begin to wonder "Where is the Hitchcock I know?" Well know this: He is coming. About 30 to 40 minutes through Rebecca, the film begins to excel, and the true Hitchcock comes through. In fact the film becomes so good that it makes up completely for the beginning of the film?almost. The beginning still holds the film back from utter greatness.The script of Rebecca is horrible. It makes the acting seem bad when it really is not, because the lines are so unspeakable. As an actor, I know this is a very bad thing. The story however, is quite genius. Maxim De Winter (Laurence Olivier) had just suffered a tragic loss. His wife Rebecca has just died, and he lives alone. That is until he meets a new woman (Joan Fontaine) who is an assistant to a pompous old fat lady. Maxim and this new girl (her name is never said, we will call her the new girl, at least for now) fall in love, but the new girl must leave to New York, after only knowing Maxim for a week. Hearing this news Maxim asks her to marry him, and come stay at his legendary estate Mandalay. They get married and move to Mandalay, but upon arrival, the new Mrs. De Winter realizes that the servants are still very much attached to the old Mrs. De Winter, Maxim's old wife Rebecca.Hitchcock's style of directing really begins to emerge during the second half of the movie. In the beginning he uses cheesy shots of Laurence Olivier (Maxim De Winter) and Joan Fontaine (The Second Mrs. De Winter) falling in love, and it is almost cringe worthy. Plus Joan Fontaine's acting is horrible. She always bears this expression the is suppose to be love, but looks more like she is looking at a Cow with three legs. But don't worry, she improves. Laurence Olivier is always good, as usual. His style is very male chauvinistic, which is really great. During the film's beginning we also see many very annoying scenes of the soon to be Mrs. De Winter courting Maxim. They are very redundant scenes, and immediately we wish that they would just break up and kill each other. The Film continues in this way for a while, simple, cheesy, and overdone. But then, about 40 minutes through, it changes.When Maxim and the new Mrs. De Winter arrive at Mandalay the film vastly improves. It becomes a thriller, which Hitchcock is so good at. The acting and dialogue improves, and we almost forget the horrible beginning. Joan Fontaine, who was so bad before, becomes great. Her look of fear as she hears more and more about Rebecca is perfect. Also the cast of servants and other characters add a wonderful flair to the film. My theory on why the beginning was so bad? Because Hitchcock makes thrillers, thrillers that are alive, and keep us watching. The script in the beginning was so dull that there was really nothing he could do with it. Plus he did not have a lot of creative control, and that is crucial to a Hitchcock film.Overall a good movie, I would not see it unless you have seen a lot more of Hitchcock films first, because you will get a bad first impression, and as we all know, first impressions are everything.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Overrated and Dated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK -- right off the bat, I'll tell you mine is going to be a contrarian review. In scanning the comments, most everyone seems to love this film, and it did win Best Picture in 1940. Therein lies the problem -- it was a Best Picture 64 years ago. Now, some of it is dated, which most people never seem to take into account when reviewing a film. (For instance, if people have first seen "Tootsie" or "Mrs. Doubtfire", then "Some Like it Hot", which everyone considers a classic, is really not that funny.) A few minor spoilers follow.Anyway -- the major issue is Joan Fontaine's character -- who can tolerate or finds such a meek mousy helpless female character believable in 2004? Not me. You want to yell at her and say "Fire the maid, you idiot!" Then there's Olivier. What on earth does she see in him? He's not nice, he's not romantic, he's not even polite to her. And when you learn at the beginning of the film his first wife died in a boating accident, anyone who has seen more than a handful of films knows it's obvious he was somehow involved.The film does pick up toward the end, with some good plot twists. That helps redeem it, but overall, there's middling suspense and non-passionate romance. 6.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of Hitchcock's worst.The script is insufferable and at times involuntarily funny. Mitchell and Webb made a parody, but they couldn't make it more funny than the original. The characters in the film are psychotic and moronic, acting in the most bizarre ways imaginable. This film is a test of patience. Perhaps that's what Hitchcock was going for.I can't believe anyone in their right mind would watch this for enjoyment. I only had to endure it for professional reasons.Final verdict: This film should be avoided at all cost unless you are searching for material for a parody of some sort.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Exceptional but perhaps a tad overrated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While I have always thought this movie was a bit overrated, it is still an exceptional film and those on IMDb who gave it scores of 1 or 2 are way out of line. Overrated it might be, but it STILL is a very good and interesting film.First, I'll complain about a few things--then discuss all the good about the film. The original story by Daphne du Maurier was a lot more risqué than the film--with a bisexual story line that is only barely hinted at in the movie. You really can't blame the film makers for this, as the Hollywood Production Code wouldn't allow this plot line to be pursued. So, instead, Rebecca was promiscuous but only with men. In addition, I am really amazed that Joan Fontaine received the Best Actress Oscar for this film. Her character often stared into space and appeared more slow-witted or annoying than just a "fish out of water". My daughter watched the film with me and said "why is that lady acting so twitchy?". In other words, she behaved in a rather strange and inexplicable manner during some of the film--particularly when she was at Mandalay. Also, I really couldn't understand why the DeWinters kept their crazy old housekeeper--after all, she tried to drive the mistress of the house to suicide. Isn't this grounds for termination of her services?!! Now, despite these complaints that definitely mar the film, there was so much to like about the movie. The script was daring and creative despite the limitations. Most times I see a movie, I say to myself that it reminds me of some other films I've seen, but in this case REBECCA is truly unique and creative. The film also had many, many twists and turns and provided one of the best endings I have seen in some time. In addition, I also liked the camera-work and music, as they created a wonderful ambiance. Despite being a black and white film, it was a beautiful picture.So my advice is to definitely see the film but just be prepared to ignore the plot holes. A hole-ridden film, to me, is still worth seeing in some cases, but somehow doesn't seem worthy of being in IMDb's top 250.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not exactly Gone With the Wind</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1939, David O. Selznick produced "Gone With the Wind" --- recognized as the greatest movie ever made until... until latter day Liberal Democrats decided it was politically incorrect as it depicted slavery during the Civil War era south --- when it was relegated by the libs to the scrap heap of history and slave-free "Casablanca" took GWTW'S place. Anyway Selznick was honored in 1939 by a ton of Oscars including Best Picture of the Year. Not satisfied with thus honoring Mr. Selznick, Hollywood bestowed another Best Picture Oscar on him in 1940 for "Rebecca." The difference being that GWTW is/was truly a great film, while "Rebecca" was boring enough to put a hyper-active into a coma of ZZZ's. "Rebecca" was an Alfred Hitchcock directed film, and I'd say there are at least 20 Hitchcock pictures of superior quality, not one of which took the Best Picture Oscar. This was perhaps the year, and the film, when Oscars became one big joke, having so many awful films having taken Best Picture. Boo! Hiss!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Captain Misogynism or the master of predictability? Take your pick.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>These lines of dialogue are a good summary of why Rebecca sucks.- I'm not beautiful, or intelligent. - But you have other, better qualities. Like kindness and sincerity. - So let me ask you, what was Rebecca like? What did people see in her? - Why, she was the most beautiful creature I've ever seen.Either this is the worst writing ever, the worst character development ever, or a really pathetic attempt to be mysterious and complex, making it again the worst writing ever. Hitchcock is so blindly driven by his technicality that he actually forgets to read the screenplays he's turning into films. And if that's not the case, if he wasn't hearing impaired on set, he has the intelligence of an infant and the creative energy of a euthanised walrus. On top of this hysterical delinquency, I can't believe women's rights groups haven't tried to bury Hitchcock under the insurmountable pile of celluloid he cost the world. Every female character in his films is either retardedly stupid, socially inept, cruel and backstabbing or insane. I can almost see sometimes the bruises on these actresses faces from the beatings he must give them in their trailers each night.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Rebecca, starring Joan Fontaine as innocent wonderful, and Laurence Olivier as, more or less, himself. Directed by Alfred Hitchcock. Yeah. Uh. Hmm. Okay, see, here, we got this movie "Rebecca" right, and everybody likes it and it wins best picture, right? But I just really, and I mean REALLY don't much care for it. I voted a 3. It's just, like, every scene in this movie had might as well be accompanied by "DUM DUM DUUUMMM!" music, and some of them ARE, so I'm not on the wrong track, here. So Hitchcock, right? I mean, what a great film putter-together! But see something else first. See North by Northwest. See Rear Window. Save this one for Flu Season. Actually, it's flu season as I'm typing this.
