		<fullReview>They sure don't make them like this any more!Blessed with a touch of genius...Alfred Hitchcock once said that you need three things in order to make a good movie : good script, good script and good script! This is a perfect example of that statement. It is as simple as that! This movie is made in 1949 and today,almost 55 years later, it still holds up and is up there with the best gangster dramas of all time. Many would disagree but frankly who cares? None of the modern gangster flicks would be the same without existence of this movie, thats for sure. The script is just great,the score is excellent and dialog is amazing!!! (try comparing it with the standards of today) Every third sentence coming out of Cody Jarretts mouth is endlessly quotable, this movie is Scarface of its time. Cagneys character in this movie is larger than life, one of the greatest gangster characters of all time... James Cagney - perhaps his greatest performance ever! I see that some fools criticize his performance,saying that it isn't great at all. My question to you is : How many movies from '40s have you seen? How wooden was the acting in those days? The answer - extremely. There were few great actors in those days, whose genius could hold up against the acting giants of today and one of them is surely James Cagney!One of top 10-15 gangster movies of all time!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The old saying, "They don't make 'em like they used to" fits this film to a T. Every other crazed-killer-goes-on-a-rampage movie ever made pales next to it. This is the best performance of Cagney's career (although, astoundingly enough, he didn't think much of the picture or his work in it, dismissing it as "just another gangster flicker"). Only Cagney could take a character like Cody Jarrett, a snarling, murderous monster with a mother fixation--someone you KNOW is going to get his at the end--and still almost make you wish he gets away. The film is one taut nerve from beginning to end. There's not a wasted moment in it; it starts out at full blast with the daring robbery of a mail train barreling through a mountain pass and doesn't let up. Performances are universally top-notch, from the stars on down to the extras. Far and away the finest film of director Raoul Walsh's long and distinguished career, this movie can take its place as not only the best gangster film ever made, but as one of the best films ever made, period.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Who But Cagney Could Pull This Off?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you like James Cagney and you like the film noirs of the late 1940s, well, it doesn't get much better than this.Cagney, who was always great at playing wild gangsters, makes this film interesting all the way through its two hours. Despite being a half-century old, he was still not far from being at the top of his game. His character, Cody Jarrett, is one of the most famous of the many he portrayed on film, which is saying a lot.Who could sit on his mother's lap and still look like a tough guy? Not many, but Cagney pulled it off here with his tough mama, played really well by Margaret Wycherly. This was a new type of role for Wycherly, who was used to doing Shakespeare. You wouldn't know it from this "Ma Jarrett" role!The "hoods" in here are all realistic tough guys and gals. Cagney's two-faced wife is played well by Virginia Mayo, who plays the typical (for this genre) floozy blonde whom you can trust about as far as you can throw.The final scene - "Top Of World, Ma!" - is one of the most famous in all of film history. It's nice to see a nice print of this out on DVD now and some of the features are very informative. Included is an interview with Mayo, who still looks pretty good for an old lady!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cagney's last great gangster film was his best...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>WHITE HEAT is the ultimate gangster melodrama with the great James Cagney at the peak of his powers. No one else in the cast is a slouch either--Virginia Mayo convinces me that Bette Davis was right when she suggested Mayo should have played Rosa Moline in BEYOND THE FOREST.Edmond O'Brien as a doggedly determined cop pretending to be a prisoner to get close to Cagney, is excellent, as he always is in these kind of roles. Steve Cochran's dirty lowdown heel is a standout as the darkly handsome actor makes the most of every line, especially in his scenes opposite Virginia Mayo. Director Raoul Walsh keeps the film spinning along at a fast clip, never once letting the rather uncomplicated plot lose any of its tension as he underscores the pathology of Cody Jarrett's character, a man obsessed by his conniving mother (Margaret Wycherly). Cagney's prison breakup scene is masterfully handled by the actor and staged for maximum effect. A rousing score by Max Steiner underlines all of the suspenseful action and there's an electrifying climax with Cagney's famous "Top of the world, ma!" before he meets his end.James Cagney has never had a better gangster role and he's given brilliant support by an outstanding cast. By all means, worth viewing as one of the great Warner crime melodramas of the late '40s.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>No one but James Cagney could play infamous gangsters like he could. Already famous for smashing a half-grapefruit on Mae Clarke's face in THE PUBLIC ENEMY, he had an appropriate bracket as another low-life in Raoul Walsh's ultra-gritty crime caper WHITE HEAT.Breaking ground for even more creepy criminals, Cagney plays Cody Jarrett, a man who wants to be on 'top of the world' and is dominated to incestuous excess by his she-wolf of a mother, Ma Jarrett (modeled on Ma Barker and played to excellence by Margaret Wycherly). These two are not people you would want to cross: Cody is capable of acts of extreme violence, and Ma Jarrett will go to great lengths to protect her son. She has even less fear then he. Both are the equivalent of Bonny and Clyde without the romantic liaison.Such so that the Feds decide to keep an intense eye on them by sending one of theirs, Hank Fallon, disguised as a common crook Vic Pardo. Both land in jail and an uneasy but increasingly dependent friendship develops, one that gets closer when Ma Jarrett dies and Cody simply goes bonkers -- in losing her, he has lost himself and this now bumps Fallon a notch closer to Cody who turns the tables of trust on him. Both bust out of prison to perform another money-making heist that has quite a different outcome than originally planned.The power of WHITE HEAT lies less on duplicities and double-crosses: other than the revelation that Cody's own wife Verna (Virginia Mayo, electrifying) was the person who offed his mother (off-screen), what matters if the relationship that the two men develop. Ed O'Brien as Fallon/Pardo seems slimier at times than James Cagney's Cody Jarrett -- his character is used to this sort of thing, living among criminals, playing the undercover cop -- and he knows all the stops to trump Cagney when the time comes. His role is actually more difficult than Cagney's because he has to underplay his part and walk on eggshells while around him, and we know that ultimately it will be revealed who he is and that Cagney will not be a happy camper at realizing this overwhelming betrayal. Featuring one of the best endings (and most quoted movie lines in film history), WHITE HEAT has gone to universal acclaim and has been referenced in its template when tackling crime dramas.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a boy's best friend is his mother</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>James Cagney lights up the screen in all respects in this violent and hard-driving film. There's nary a dull moment with Jimmy on hand, whether having his mother ease his migraine tantrums by rubbing his head or shooting a fellow gang member through the trunk of his car in order to give him a little air. Raoul Walsh vigorously directs this movie with remarkable gusto given that he was over sixty at the time and at at this point in his career had nothing to prove. Cagney's character of Cody Jarrett is shown to be a madman at the start of the film. There's no need for his confederates to engage in a little is-he-or-isn't-he chitchat regarding his sanity a la The Caine Mutiny. They know he's mad. Even his mother knows he's mad. No matter. Cody continues on his crime spree, and his gang stays loyal to him, if only for the consequences of leaving him being to frightening to contemplate. He has a girl, who two-times him with another gang member. A federal agent who infiltrates the gang and becomes a surrogate mother by easing his headaches in the same manner, also betrays him, though it's his job to do so. Only Ma Jarrett, it seems, could be trusted.One of the many charms of this film is its absolute refusal to make a statement, which wasn't Raoul Walsh's bag anyway; and screenwriters Ivan Goff and Ben Roberts, though they delve into Freud a bit, don't get too heavy over Cagney's psychopathology. They just accept it, show us its various sides, and leave it at that. This movie is a far cry from other films made around the same time, was highly popular when first released, and remains so to this day. It is not quite film noir, being too bright and rational. Nor is it a study in perverse psychology, despite its main character. For all the location filming it is no semi-documentary in the manner of House On 92nd Street. It is basically a lively action picture whose makers, taking a cue from Hiroshima bomb, decided to end their movie with a bang, making their show a fine example of good, clean apocalyptic fun.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An extraordinary performance from James Cagney turns what might have been a by-the-numbers movie into a masterpiece. Everything revolves around Cagney. Edmond O'Brien, Virginia Mayo, and Margaret Wycherly are all superb, but when Cagney is off the screen you wait for him to come back.Cody Jarrett (Cagney) is a desperate gangster, standing on the ledge at the end of the Public Enemy era. But 'White Heat' gives us a much more intricate psychological portrait of it's anti-hero protagonist than earlier gangster movies. Cody's dependence on his "Ma" is at the crux of the story; there is no finer example of the corrupted mother in film history, even Mrs. Bates takes a backseat to Ma Jarrett.Throughout the film, events, and characters, conspire against Cody all leading to his delivering of one of most iconic lines ever concocted by Hollywood. I won't repeat it, you know what it is even if you've never seen the movie, but even with prior knowledge it's still an extraordinarily moving moment given the context in which it's delivered.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well... O.K.! I'm gonna say the same things than the other IMDB users! After some fine films as an actor producer in the 1940's, great James Cagney returns to the type of role he doesn't want to be anymore : a gangster! Perhaps he was knowing that this time should be the last time, because he's adding and adding some meaness to his character. Cagney, as a gangster, was never so great in a movie! He's mad, dangerous, he's everything - and more! - we want to see from a Hollywood gangster! Adding to that a very good cast, with superb Virginia Mayo in one of the best women's gangster movie role. Add some solid and masculine work by director Raoul Walsh and we have perhaps the best gangster movie of all time. And of course, there's the finale nobody wants to forget... Did I say the same things? Yes? That's one more good reason to see this film!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Warner Brothers decided to kill off their cycle of gangster films with WHITE HEAT. A pity perhaps but what a film to end their success on . Cagney will always be remembered for playing gangsters and Cody Jarret is his most memorable performance , but Ivan Goff and Ben Roberts script is nearly as memorable as Cagney due to its high level of intelligence . I especially liked the way the gang tried to test Fallon by leaving the photograph of his wife on the table in the prison cell , little touches like that make WHITE HEAT a classic . If it was made nowadays we`d get bad language , graphic sex, bloodbaths and post modernist references to pop culture . Well you can keep all that Quentin Tarantino rubbish , this is how a good film should be made . Top of the world</fullReview>

		<fullReview>White Heat is directed by Raoul Walsh and adapted by Ivan Goff &amp; Ben Roberts from a story suggested by Virginia Kellogg. It stars James Cagney, Virginia Mayo, Edmond O'Brien, Steve Cochran &amp; Margaret Wycherly. Music is by Max Steiner and photography by Sidney Hickox.Cody Jarrett (Cagney) is the sadistic leader of a violent and ruthless gang of thieves. Unnervingly devoted to his mother (Wycherly) and afflicted by terrible headaches since childhood, Cody is one bad day away from being a full blown psychotic. That day is coming soon, and everyone in his way is sure to pay.Around the time of White Heat being released, two things were evident as regards its star and its themes. One is that it had been a long time since a gangster, and a truly vicious one at that, had thrilled or frightened a cinema audience. The Production Code and a change in emotional value due to World War II had seen the genuine career gangster all but disappear. Second thing of note is that Cagney was stung by the disappointing performance of Cagney Productions. So after having left Warner Brothers in 1942, the diminutive star re-signed for the studio and returned to the genre he had almost made his own in the 30s. He of course had some say in proceedings, such as urging the makers to ensure a crime does not pay motif, but all told he needed a hit and the fit with Raoul Walsh and the psychotic Jarrett was perfect. It may not be his best acting performance, but it's certainly his most potent and arguably it's the cream of the gangster genre crop.The inspiration for the film is mostly agreed to be the real life criminals: Ma Barker, Arthur "Doc" Barker and Francis Crowley. A point of worth being that they were all 30s criminals since White Heat very much looks and feels like a 30s movie. Cagney for sure is older (he was 50 at the time) and more rotund, but he and the film have the presence and vibrancy respectively to keep it suitably in period and in the process becoming the last of its kind. White Heat is that rare old beast that manages to have a conventional action story at its core, yet still be unique in structure and portrayal of the lead character. Neatly crafted by Walsh around four Cody Jarrett "moments" of importance, the Oedipal tones playing out between Cody and his Ma make for an uneasy experience, but even then Walsh and the team pull a rabbit out the hat by still garnering sympathy for the crazed protagonist. It sounds nutty, but it really is one of the big reasons why White Heat is the great film that it is. Another reason of course is "those" special scenes, two of which are folklore cinematic legends now. Note legend number 1 as Cody, incarcerated, receives bad news, the reaction is at once terrifying and pitiful (note the extras reaction here since they didn't know what was coming). Legend number 2 comes with "that" ending, forever quotable and as octane ignited finale's go it takes some beating. As brilliant and memorable as Cagney is, it's not, however, a one man show. He's superbly directed by Walsh, with the great director maintaining a pace and rhythm to match Cody Jarrett's state of mind. And with Steiner (Angels With Dirty Faces/Casablanca/Key Largo) scoring with eerie strands and strains, and Hickox (The Big Sleep/To Have and Have Not) adding noir flourishes for realism and atmosphere, it's technically a very smart picture. The supporting cast in the face of Cagney's barnstorming come up with sterling work. Wycherly is glorious as the tough and tetchy Ma Jarrett and O'Brien is needed to be spot on in the film's second most important role; a role that calls for him to not only be the first man Cody has ever trusted, but also as some sort of weird surrogate mother! Mayo isn't called on to do much, but she's gorgeous and sexy and fatalistic in sheen. While Cochran holds his end up well as the right hand man getting ideas above his station.White Heat is as tough as they come, a gritty pulsating psycho drama that has many visual delights and scenes that are still as powerful and as shocking some 60 odd years since it first hit the silver screen. What is often forgotten, when yet another clip of the brilliant ending is shown on TV, is that it's also a weird and snarky piece of film. All told, it is blisteringly hot. 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A classic drama and a classic psychological study</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Cagney's ability to shock is constant and each new gangster he creates shows a new facet of the psychopathic mind. White heat is the perfect antidote to the earlier movies- the structure where good triumphs in the last reel is still there but the killer, out of control is far less romanticised- if only current directors could develop this message. Cody Jarrett is the product of an over protective mother and thug father in the classic pattern. His whole view of the world is simplistic without subtlety or shade. Like all people of his type his self-confidence betrays him because he sees other people as stereotypes and while he has insight into the sorts of people who form his support network, he, very unwisely, dismisses the intelligence of the opposition. Like all gangsters, he has very little grasp of the outside world- throughout the film he is trapped in boxes, just like the man he kills in the boot of his car. Cagney's portrayal is his greatest role- his avoidance of pathos and his refusal to bend emotionally mean that we are never invited to pity him- wherever there seems to be a point of access for the audience he delivers the lines with a flatness which denies us sympathy. His maudlin obsession with his mother invites us to loathe his infantile mental paralysis. Not enough comments praise the real co-star: Margaret Wycherley. She is a sinister mother who can handle the police and the gang and Cody's wife. Her world-weary cynicism, her obsession with her son delivered in the same dead-pan style is such a total antithesis to the usual hollywood 'caring parent' model that she raises the character to the level of an Empress Livia or an Agrippina. The final scene works on multiple levels- the good-guy cannot easily destroy the villain- does the world blow up in Cody's face or are we being told that the Jarretts of the world will dominate until they bring the universe to destruction? A film which still demands analysis and does more to reveal the nature of criminal amorality than anything Tarrantino or Scorsese could produce- The latter types of director are too caught up in the 'romance' of the villainous life- they need to develop Raoul Walsh's objectivity and Cagney's penetration. It is Cagney's unequivocal hatred of the character he's portraying and the personal honesty which allows him to objectify both the character he is playing and himself as an actor that makes the whole thing work. The crude method actors we're stuck with today could learn a lot from his Cody Jarrett!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>He Burns White Hot: Pure Hatred</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers Ahead:The best performance of Cagney in any movie. He is not hateful; he is hate. The scene where he turns on O Brien and says,"Well, how about that boys, a copper, I was going 50 / 50 with a lousy copper." The level of malevolence in his voice; try finding that kind of power in a modern actor please. No kung fu, explosions, just powerful, fantastic acting. The movie was made during the heyday of Freudianism so we have the requisite mother complex but Walsh throws in hints of organic brain problems with the recurrent migraines. Try to overlook some of the signs of how dated it is: silly radar on top of the cars; this is a real masterpiece. Other than mom, he has nothing but hatred for every other living creature. He leaves the guy in the freezing cabin, shoots the guy who tried to flatten him, in the trunk. Cody Jarrett is pure intensity and centered purpose. Young people, want to see why people over 40 cannot take the acting in your comic book movies? Watch James Cagney as Cody Jarrett. Yes, slightly better acting than canoe in the Day The Earth Stood Still. Because of the code, at the time, of course O Brien has to get the better of Jarrett. The film is still unique because he is not captured; some say it was insanity, no he is utterly fearless. Death he has lived with every day of his life. Look at the looks on the cops as they scurry for cover. Mayo and Big Ed both do great jobs in this movie. Mayo was always an underrated actress. The movie shows the planning and fencing are outsourced by Jarrett giving the film greater realism. The fisherman who is lost is a nice touch along with the gas truck to infiltrate the refinery. Raoul Walsh was a great director; this is his best film. Cagney does not need an orchestra behind him to frighten you. He just has this baleful, malevolent look about him. Watch when he figures out, in prison, that he was almost murdered by that guy. The look he gives him will make your skin crawl. I still think this was the template Pacino used when crafting his Tony Montana. The same identical pure hate burning with rage. I understand some of the criticisms but really, ignore the anachronistic elements of the script: drive in, radar on top of car: the star of this masterpiece is Cagney as Cody Jarrett. I love The Roaring Twenties but please, he dies on the steps a has been. The Best Ending Of Any Movie. THE GANGSTER MOVIE</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Gangsters Have Mommy Issues</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An elaborate, bloody and very exciting heist of treasury bonds from a train kicks off White Heat, a movie I had been wanting to see for a long time, and my expectations were met and then some. The heist's mastermind is Cody Jarrett (James Cagney), a leader of a band of thieves who is the strangest, yet most entertaining gangster I've seen in a movie: he's a man prone to random crushing headaches and who is hopelessly devoted to his co-conspiring mother, much to the chagrin of both his second-in-command and his neglected wife. Unfortunately for Cody, he does not get away clean, but he has a card up his sleeve: do time for another, lesser crime he had committed earlier so that he can avoid the severe punishment of this one. While unable to step in, the treasury responds by having an agent assume the alias of Vic Pardo and pose as an inmate and befriend Cody so that the law can bring him and gang to justice. Meanwhile, his wife and his former right-hand man make plans of their own: move the organization forward, and without Cody - literally. Pardo inadvertently foils their assassination attempt, a move which makes his bond with Jarrett even stronger. The two eventually get out of jail, and while Cody quickly regains control and even lines up his next heist, the payroll of a major chemical plant, he remains unaware of Pardo's real intentions. Cody's gang and the law both converge on the plant, which becomes the set piece for a (literally) explosive conclusion.What surprised me the most about White Heat is its energy and speed. Instead of having the careful, measured pace typical of 40's film noir, it resembles what a feature-length episode of 24 would be like, and given the volatility of the Jarrett character, this is entirely appropriate. Cagney definitely sunk his teeth into the role: his creepy behavior, especially his relationship with his mother, really gets under your skin, and when he's violent, he makes even Joe Pesci in Goodfellas seem tame. The violence in general is very shocking: there are many shootings, and each one hasn't a shred of regret or remorse. As for the movie's two major heists, both are simply thrilling to watch, not to mention interesting in how they reveal how criminals operated during that era. Still, what is even more interesting is how the law uses technology to chase down Jarrett and his gang. There is heavy and seemingly accurate use of car phones, radar detection and other techniques I had no idea were in use at the time. I will admit, however, that the movie did not leave me with a whole lot to think about afterward, which is disappointing given Jarrett's strange quirks which, while unique, only seemed to be there for the plot's sake rather than examine of the burdens of having an Oedipus complex. Still, I will not deny that I was entertained, and I would be hard pressed to find a better example of noir and action done right.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Certain Insane Grandeur</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"White Heat" has a complex if ingenious plot. Arthur Cody Jarrett is the leader of a gang of criminals who have carried out a train robbery during which four men were shot dead. It becomes clear, however, to Jarrett that the police suspect him of this crime, so in order to throw them off the scent he flies to Illinois where he confesses to a quite different robbery in which he had no involvement at all. The two robberies took place on the same day, so Jarrett believes he has the perfect alibi. If he was robbing a hotel in Illinois, he could not have been robbing a train in California. The Illinois robbery involved no killings, so only carries a relatively light sentence.The police, however, are aware that Jarrett's guilty plea to the Illinois robbery is not genuine, and infiltrate an agent, posing as a convict under the assumed name "Vic Pardo", into the prison where Jarrett is serving his sentence. The idea is that Pardo will be placed into the same cell as Jarrett to see if he will talk about the California robbery. Events then take an unexpected turn. Unknown to Jarrett his lieutenant Big Ed is also the lover of his beautiful young wife, Verna, and has ambitions to take control of the gang. Ed has an associate inside the prison, whom he orders to kill Jarrett. Jarrett's life is saved, however, by Pardo's intervention. Jarrett's elderly mother, to whom he is very close, finds out about the attempt on her son's life and swears to get revenge, although he begs her not to. The old lady confronts Big Ed and Verna but is shot dead by them. Jarrett, maddened by grief at his mother's death, escapes from prison, taking Pardo with him as a hostage. Jarrett resumes his career as a criminal, leading to a final showdown with the police."White Heat" is sometimes characterised as a film noir, although I prefer to think of it, and other similar gangster films, as "not quite noir". Although its subject-matter is crime, and it uses the dramatic lighting effects and photography that were characteristic of film noir, it lacks another typical noir characteristic, an atmosphere of moral ambiguity. It is a cops-and-robbers thriller with the moral boundaries very clearly defined; the cops are good and the robbers are bad. Those parts of the film which deal with the FBI could almost have been written by J. Edgar Hoover himself. The government agents are clean-cut, brave, honourable, incorruptible and a good deal smarter and more resourceful than the likes of Jarrett give them credit for.That does not, however, make "White Heat" an inferior film. Today, a film with such clear-cut moral distinctions would be regarded at best na?ve as and simplistic and at worst as disguised government propaganda, so used have we become to films which portray the police either as corrupt (e.g. "L.A. Confidential") or as hilariously incompetent (e.g. the "Police Academy" series) or as brutal and heavy-handed (numerous examples from "Dirty Harry" onwards). A crime film, however, which expresses a moral preference for law enforcers over law breakers is not necessarily suspect, any more than is a war film which shows the Allies as being morally better than the Nazis.Although the film's sympathies are very much with the forces of law and order, it is the villainous characters rather than the virtuous ones that stand out- Virginia Mayo's Verna, Margaret Wycherly's Ma and, most of all, James Cagney's superb performance as Jarrett. He is a psychopathic criminal who will kill without remorse anyone who gets in his way, be they policemen or innocent bystanders, or even members of his own gang. (He leaves to die one of the gang who was injured during the train robbery). He has no feelings for Verna and treats her coldly and callously, doubtless the reason why she turned to Big Ed for comfort. His one good quality is his deep love for his mother, yet even this can often seem suspect. A word frequently used about it is "oedipal", which implies that it is not so much a redeeming virtue as a symptom of his underlying psychiatric illness. There are two particularly memorable scenes in the film. The first is the one where he learns of his mother's death while in prison. Cagney brings an intensity to this scene that makes Jarrett's rage seem particularly frightening. The second is the famous "top of the world" scene, the final shoot-out with the police in the chemical plant, in which Jarrett, despite his vicious character, achieves a certain insane grandeur. In Jarrett's disordered mind he really is "top of the world". When I reviewed the original version of "Get Carter" on this website, I stated that I had never seen another film which better reveals the sterility and futility of the criminal lifestyle. Having now seen "White Heat", I can say that "Get Carter" now has a rival in this regard. 9/10</fullReview>

I have seen many impresiions of James Cagney and now that i actually got to see the man himself, i can see what the impressionists were doing. A lot of them that i saw were dead on! Cagney delivers a riveting performance of gangster boss Cody Jarrett. Jarrett is a psychopathic mama's boy who while in the pen plans a heist of an oil refinery unbeknown st to him that his new cell mate is a plant by the police. A great film that if anyone knows of other classics i might enjoy such as this please share!! Renewed my faith in the era of black and white film. ON TOP OF THE WORLD MA!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After a long absence from gangster films, Jimmy Cagney returned in WHITE HEAT. However, it's not just a typical gangster film as Cagney plays one of the craziest killers in film history--and the final product is incredibly entertaining.Cagney plays a combination momma's boy and antisocial killing machine. What makes this more interesting is his unusually close relationship with his mother--who follows him as he goes on bank jobs around the country. While he has a girlfriend (Virginia Mayo), he's so attached to Mom that he cannot live without her. Heck, I almost expected to see him in bed with her--they were that close and it was very creepy. It was like Freud's idea of the Oedipal Complex except Cagney DID succeed in seducing and capturing his mother! Later in the film, Cagney's mother is killed--after which, Cagney becomes a lot more imbalanced. In addition to this, he has periodic blinding headaches and it's almost comical to see him writhing in pain one minute and blasting some guy for practically no reason the next! After this gang evades the police for some time, a special agent (Edmund O'Brien) insinuates himself into the gang--becoming a trusted friend of Cagney in the process. Eventually, of course, the gang is captured and Cagney is confronted by a bazillion law enforcement officers in the most spectacular ending of any film noir picture in history. You just have to see it to believe it! Overall, a great script with lots of interesting psychological components. While Cagney's performance isn't the lest bit subtle, it certainly is very entertaining. For any lover of noir, this is a must-see and one of the most memorable films in movie history.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cagney as caged animal</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This classic was offered as part of Turner's crime week "behind bars" series, and to be honest, I didn't expect much, not being a fan of gangster flicks. But the fast-paced no-holds barred direction didn't let up, a tribute to the director R. Walsh. The movie seems to avoid the cliches of shoot'em ups because it defines them. It's a straight tale, told with no irony. While all the supporting characters are good, including Ma Garrett, what holds the picture together is Cagney's charisma. From his opening scene, jumping onto the train, to the chase at the end leading to the conflagration, I had the feeling that I was watching a desperate caged animal. When policemen refer to a face as a "mug," they were probably thinking of Cagney. What a mug! -- and when he pulled the trigger, all the venom in his veins came shooting out.Only a few actors in the history of cinema give so much of themselves, and when they do, we recognize them as stars. I think the reason "White Heat" gets such a high score from reviewers is that few of us (actors or audience) have the guts to show this kind of evil or all-out desperation, in an otherwise tame movie, and to recognize it as part of one's nature, not as part of an "act," which is how most actors would do the hoodlum or bad guy in other run of the mill films. One difference between the film noir of the forties, is how this evil is conceived by the writer(s). In "White Heat," while Cagney doesn't torture anyone, he gets his kicks from shooting them, or allowing them to be steamed to death. short and sweet. Later, post-WW II movies would place evil in the form of a Nazi, with torture, and then, by the nineties, we have psychological evil in the form of Hannibal Lecter and the very slow roast, where noone can outwit him. Anthony Hopkins' genius was to grasp the psychopathic side of himself and allow it to be revealed on screen.Cagney had courage to let out unbridled badness. This affected his co-star, bringing out Mayo's terror in one scene, so she didn't have to "act" either, according to a recent interview describing their working together. It's a pity to learn from the other reviews that this movie hit the top of Cagney's career and that it was downhill after that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>James Cagney's performance is amazing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Though the acting in this film is excellent all around, Cagney steals the show. His performance is good not just because he was an excellent actor, but because he knew just how far to take the role of Cody without appearing cartoonish. He spends much of the film stomping around like a petulant, angry little boy, but then he surprises with a few moments of gentle reminiscing about his mother. His command of the role is remarkable because he seems to know the character so well that he becomes Cody; I think this is the ultimate statement about an actor's skills because you forget that he's acting. His every expression, roll of his eyes, sneer, maniacal laugh, howl of anger or glee, these things came from his heart. The scene where Cagney walks out of the house eating a drumstick and casually ventilating the trunk of the car with his gun is something that Tarentino might have used fifty years later. And I doubt that anyone could fail to see how deeply he loved his mother after his wail of despair when he learns of her death. His stunned disbelief at learning Fallon is a cop practically leaps off the screen: "I treated him like a kid brother." It's a wretched scene. It's hard to believe this is the same actor who made such impossible dance moves in "Yankee Doodle Dandy". James Cagney was a remarkable actor. I doubt that any contemporary actor ever possessed the same kind of intensity. James Caan was once this intense a long time ago.Virginia Mayo is radiant, whether being treacherous or purring like a kitten as it suits her plans. Cody doesn't really care for her, even when he's carrying her piggyback around the house. It seems warm and light-hearted, but she'll never take the place of dear old mom, and she knows it. Her best line is delivered at the end of the movie when she's trying to save her own neck: "you dirty copper." The way she says it always makes me laugh. But don't turn your back on her, if you know what I mean.Raoul Walsh's tight direction doesn't let you stop for a moment. Something is always happening in the movie, even at the very end, where the alien landscape is dominated by gigantic refinery spheres. This is postwar U.S. prosperity, where Cody's old-fashioned gangster world doesn't belong, and the results are predictably abrupt and terrifying. They even use a primitive form of GPS to catch him, and walk around with walkie-talkies, technology that Cody couldn't begin to understand. Out with the old world, in with the new.Edmond O'Brien is good too, but he's no match against Cagney and knows it, so he plays it really straight and low-key. You can see the desperation in his face. I think Walsh was ahead of his time when he played the truck driver (I forget his name) against Fallon, where they constantly kept missing each other's faces by a split second; it's really clever the way Walsh does this, and you find yourself saying "oh no" several times as they just miss each other. It's almost humorous the way Walsh does this. Only at the end do their eyes finally meet, and there's the spark of recognition.This movie is fantastic, and every bit as groundbreaking as "Citizen Kane" or "Sunset Boulevard". At least watch it for James Cagney, there will never be another actor like him.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cagney!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What is it to have an authentic thought? There is nothing mirrored and not even a mirror, it somehow gives the impression that it springs from air. Cagney was nothing if not an authentic guy; and there's no talking about this without Cagney. The film is perfectly tense and gripping in general, a brooding crime melodrama about a broken man who flings his pieces at the world. But Cagney makes it matter.Sure you'll see here in his last gangster role a set of mannerisms more psychotic than usual. Nicholson no doubt took note for his Joker. Alternately, you may think of him in this film as an early Pacino, creating gravitas out of nothing. Two things you should know here about Cagney; he was one of very few Hollywood stars who was committed to a long marriage; and he had a deep bonding to his mother.So what powerful alignment here! In this role he is required as Cody Jarrett to face the possibilities of betrayal by his wife and that his relationship with his mother is deep down psychotic and even the cause of his wanting to be on the stage. Together, it means he must play someone who faces loneliness and age while plotting some crime story.I hope I'm not presuming too much. But Cagney was an intelligent man and though he was never quite a Method actor, he couldn't fail to implicitly recognize the situation. In his big scene of the breakdown, the story goes that he told the filmmaker to keep the cameras rolling no matter what, meaning he knew he could find the place from which to throw himself.So this inarticulate recognition creates all the tension. Methodists like Brando and Clift, knowing this is powerful, would try to mask the pain, artfully presenting sides to the camera so that we'd infer the rest. Cagney completely throws himself in the thing, holds and conceals nothing. This isn't masterful in the Method sense of consciously inhabiting a self, controlling; it's skiing on the tension. It cuts because you can tell that it cuts him to face what he must as the character. His anguished wails in that scene felt to me like genuinely some inner child being torn.The climax is pretty great, what they pulled off from doing at the last moment in Angels 10 years before.Noir Meter: 2/4</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There is no question that "White Heat" was James Cagney's best performance as a gangster - certainly not his best performance in any film, but as the psychopathic killer he was outstanding, and showed how much we missed him in this kind of movie for a few years. He was ably supported by Virginia Mayo in perhaps her best and most demanding role; Edmond O"Brien, as good as ever; Steve Cochran as the doublecrosser; and the wonderful Margaret Wycherley as Cody's much loved mother. The scene in the prison when Cody runs amok was truly memorable as is the ending to a very gripping, well-told story. The photography did seem to lack clarity in a way that surprisingly helped the mood that permeated all the way through - the background music had a major role in this also. When one thinks of Cagney these days, "Yankee Doodle Dandy" and "White Heat" are the two films that spring to mind for me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great gangster film that is smart, gripping and violent</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Cody Jarrett is a psychopathic criminal known for violently leading his gang with his wife and beloved mother by his side. His gang pull off a train robbery but somehow or other information leaks out to the police in the aftermath and Jarrett finds himself being hunted as the main suspect. Fortunately, for all his violent rages and blinding headaches, Cody has planned for this and had arranged for a minor robbery to be carried out at the same time many states away ? pleading guilty to this one gets him two years but gives him an alibi for the real robbery and sees him dodge the death penalty. The police can see this is his plan though and plant a man inside the jail to stick close to Jarrett.Of course we all know this film as a classic and I imagine that many more people know the famous climax than have actually watched the whole piece. I admit that for myself it has been over ten years since I last watched this film and decided to give it a spin recently. Watching it again it is refreshing to feel the power of it in the big moments but also the impact in the smaller moments and within the character of Jarrett. It is a great gangster film because it has a solid plot but, more importantly, has this great character at the core. The audience are never really allowed to feel sympathy for Jarrett for very long. OK here and there we are showed the formative forces on him and perhaps consider him a product but mostly he is too cruel and violent to feel for ? the paranoia, the quick temper and so on all keep him from this.The psychoanalysis part of the film is perhaps a little pat on the surface of it but it has value added in the way that this is written through the characters. In this way I think Ma is a more critical part of the film that some give her credit for because not only does she have to exist as a mother character but she has to exist in a way that convinces in context alongside Cody. It is good writing that she does do this but it is also a solid performance from Wycherly that makes it work. Of course the dominant performance is from Cagney and in a way it is a shame that the clip that is always played from this film is the climax and not the countless other moments that are memorable for the quality work that he turns in across the whole film. Support is also good from Mayo (as his too pretty wife) and O'Brien as the undercover cop. Walsh directs the material really well, letting the violence be present for almost the whole film even when nothing is happening and also preventing us anything to cling to within Jarrett that we can bond with.The end result is a great gangster film that is smart, gripping and violent. Cagney dominates it of course but credit to Wycherly and O'Brien for holding their own characters well alongside such a performance. There is much more to this than the memorable ending and if you only know the film for that then you should check it out properly.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jimmy Cagney at his very best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have just seen White Heat properly for the first time and has to be of Jimmy Cagney's best movies.Gangster Cody Jarrett and his gang hold up a train and rob it, killing several people in the process. Cody then goes on the run and then hands himself in to confess to a less serious robbery he committed. He gets jailed for a year but while in jail, he is joined by an undercover cop and he plans to escape to carry out his next big robbery, to rob a chemical plant. After managing to escape, the gang travel to the chemical plant in a tanker with the police following them. The police close in and the gang are arrested or killed but not Cody, who at the end as storage tanks explode around him, says the movie's famous line: "Made it, Ma! Top of the world"!The action in the movie starts from the beginning and is non stop throughout. The excellent, haunting and thunderous score is by Max Steiner (King Kong).As well as a great performance by Cagney, the movie also stars Virginia Mayo as his wife, Margaret Wycherly as his Ma and Edmond O'Brien as the undercover cop.This movie is a must see for all. Fantastic.Rating: 5 stars out of 5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Go down in a Blaze of Glory, if you have too.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I tried to deny the hype. Convinced myself that "White Heat" wasn't really that good. I even went out of my way to avoid the film. I had nothing against the man, I just never saw any of Cagney's films. I made quite possibly the biggest mistake of my film buff career. I simply ignored this film as a defining picture.That is until I caught a film called "Angels with Dirty Faces" on TCM late one night. Hey anything with Bogie it can't be bad, right? Than something surprised me, for the first time in my life I wasn't paying attention to Bogart. Considering how I regard Bogart as the greatest actor of all time, this isn't an easy task. The unbelievable happened, James Cagney stole the show. With that dangerous quality and infectious smile. The man has Character and knows how to use it.In 1949 there was a change going on in Hollywood. An out with the old mentality, ushering in the Brando's and the Dean's. But WB and Cagney got together and said one more round. Slip the audience with "White Heat" as a convincer. And what they brought to the table was truly one of the greatest performances that I've ever seen. Cagney at his best and never a dull moment. And just when I think it can't get any better, they went and hit me with it. Quite possibly, the greatest ending ever.When a man is put to the test. I mean really betrayed and at a loss. No east way out. No escape. Nothing is fair and everything is not what it seems. You either give up and go quietly or you simply just check out. What would you do? Go down in a blaze of fallen glory if you have too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A classic, one of the very best films I've ever seen - Cagney is a god!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"White Heat" may not be typical film noir in the literal sense, but the vibes are unmistakable. It's classic James Cagney noir, and he gives his best performance ever. It's the pinnacle for all future mobster movies - "Godfather," "Scarface" (the remake) and even "GoodFellas" all borrow styles or concepts from this. The ending is eerily similar to Pacino in "Scarface." Cagney stars as a mobster (giving one of his snarling performances). The plot basically follows his rise and fall. Throughout, he has a strange fascination / obsession with his mother. He loves her more than his girlfriend.This is one element that really impressed me. For a film from 1949 it really handles some seedy elements rather well - this would still raise eyebrows if it were released over fifty years later! Cagney is absolutely terrific. The film is a huge tour de force, breathtaking and mesmerizing. One of my favorite films, I would write more about the plot but I've found I always end up ruining the movie for people! (I have to restrain myself from referencing the ending!) If you like film noir, mobster movies or James Cagney (or all of the above!) go buy this movie right now.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>White Heat is an excellent film and it's also a great character study</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>White Heat is a brilliant film which initially plays out as just a standard mob film, but there is so much more depth and subtext to this film. Whilst it is a mob/gang related film in part, it acts more as a character study for Cody Jarrett (James Cagney).Cody is a psychopathic criminal who cares about absolutely no-one apart from his dear mother (played by Margaret Wycherly). I feel that the deeper subtext with his undying fixation with his mother is that he feels he has no-one else he can trust. Part of this is probably due to the fact that his father is no longer around and due to the fact that his father also had psychological issues, Cody probably feels that his mother will be the only one who will understand him and he doesn't want to let his guard down to anyone. The 'first' scene where Cody gets one of his headaches perfectly demonstrates this point - he ends up getting a pain in his head and runs off into another room, but good old Ma is there and tells him 'not to let them see him like that'. The point here is that she knows Cody has a weakness, but she doesn't want anyone else to see it for fear of his fellow mob members losing respect for him if they see he's got a weakness.The second act sees Cody in jail, but interestingly not for the train heist that he committed at the start of the film. Cody confesses to a robbery of a hotel (which someone else had arranged) in a completely different area to make the police think that he hasn't had any involvement with the train heist. At first, this seems strange, but the reason he has done it is that he knew that his sentence would be more severe for the train heist. Therefore he's confessed to a lesser crime that he didn't commit in order to avoid being sentenced for a more serious crime that he did commit. Genius!However, the police are onto him and send in one of their own men to prison with Cody to try to delve deeper into Cody's organisation. The police officer who they send in is Hank Fallon/Vic Pardoe (Edmund O'Brien). Pardoe (as he becomes known to Cody) befriends Cody, but things take a turn when Cody begins to respect Pardoe and decides that he wants Pardoe to break out of prison with him and perform a heist on a chemical payroll plant with his old gang. For me this is where the film gained a bit of depth, with Cody isolated from his mother Pardoe tries to manipulate Cody into trusting him (which he does successfully) and Cody finally drops his guard slightly and decides to trust someone (other than his mother). Of course, Cody's trust doesn't come easy and Pardoe finds on a couple of occasions that he has to take some rather drastic measures in order to gain his trust. For me, the best aspect of this film is Cody Jarrett himself - he is a fascinating character, sometimes he's calm, sometimes he's psychotic, and then there are those occasional moments when he gets his severe headaches. He is a multi layered character and that's what made him so interesting and that's also what gave him so much depth.There is also a sub plot ruining throughout involving Cody's wife Verna (Mayo) and one of Cody's gang members Big Ed Somers (Cochran). Verna and Ed want to be together so Ed tries to get someone on the inside to try and kill Cody whilst he's in prison. Thankfully, this sub plot didn't factor too much into this film which was good because as far as I was concerned this was the least interesting aspect of the whole film. This is just brilliant. It is exciting, suspenseful, complete with a fascinating central character in Cody Jarrett. The acting was generally good (particularly from Cagney &amp; Wycherley). I thought that this was not only an excellent film, but also a brilliant character study.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Dawn of the Modern Gangster Movie!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"High Sierra" director Raoul Walsh's "White Heat" ranks as the greatest, post World War II, gangster saga. Although you feel no sympathy for Cagney's disturbed criminal, you cannot help but marvel at his gripping portrayal of this mentally disturbed maniac. The scene where Cody has an informer locked up in a trunk exemplifies this characteristic. The guy in the trunk had been paid to kill Cody and failed. When he crashed out of prison, Cody brought the imbecile along and stashed him in the back of the car. Now, the guy wants some air. Cody approaches the car with an auto pistol in one fist and a chicken leg in his other fist. He fires several times into the trunk so the thug has air. The humor is as grim as the action. Truly, "White Heat" is the dawn of the modern era in crime films. The gangsters were no longer products of Prohibition. Cody Jarrett isn't a minority. The Ivan Goff and Ben Roberts screenplay is true to the Warner Brothers' tradition of the gangster movie. You won't find anybody any tougher than Cody Jarrett, but we support him on in his civil disobedience. Cody has no extenuating circumstances other than a history of mental illness that runs in his father's side of the family. You see, Cody is crazy. Afflicted with 'red-hot buzz saw' headaches, Cody trusts nobody except his mother. She is one tough, old, bird, and Margaret Wycherly milks the role for everything it's worth. She believes in her son and will do anything to see him achieve greatness. After he recovers from a brain seizure, Cody climbs into his mother's lap. Walsh and lenser Sidney Hickox frame the shot so that Cagney doesn't look like Groucho Marx in Margaret Dumont's lap. Ironically, Cody is still tied to his mother's apron strings. After the brain seizure, Ma gives Cody a drink and utters the toast "Top of the World." Cody achieves his objective, "the top of the world," when he goes out in an immense flaming explosion at the end. One character observes, "He finally got to the top of the world. And it blew right up in his face." If you crave crime movies, you MUST see "White Heat."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>No banks, grocery stores or fancy clubs for Cody Jarrett and his gang. You can leave that for the street punks. Jarrett goes for the gold, literally. If he could find a way into the U.S. Mint and steal the gold plates, he'd go for it. But federal reserve trains and a power plant is more his style. After all, he's determined to make it to the top of the world. His "gentle" mama will see to that.James Cagney plays the most malicious gangster of his career, a violent psychopath that has no qualms about leaving a burnt victim behind to die or shooting holes into the back of a car to give one of his hostages "air". He's also a gentleman with the ladies. Check out his relationship with his trampy wife (Virginia Mayo) who is just as malicious as he his. Just watch how she takes care of his mother while he's in prison on a lesser charge he took from local authorities to establish an alibi to keep him from being pursued by the fed's.This is truly one of Cagney's greatest performances, showing us his character's insanity through violent headaches (which may be a type of epilepsy) where he utilizes his intense dance training to indicate seizures that can only be soothed by head massages his devoted Ma Barker mike mother gives him. She's a piece of work, shrewdly noticing her car being followed, her eyes indicating satisfaction as well as disgust as she makes some well calculated turns to avoid them. This Lady MacBeth of gangster films is played with absolutely no softness (except for Cagney) by Margaret Wycherly. She's so determined that when Cagney begs her to leave the revenge against gang traitors to him, she takes it upon herself like an American Madame DeFarge to go forward with it anyway.This film is famous for its explosive final, so there's no real surprise, but that does not matter at all. It's the method of the intended heist and the journey to the top of the world for Cagney who is unaware that the fellow prison inmate (Edmund O'Brien) who rescued him several times from certain death is actually an FBI agent out to trap him into a showdown with the fed's. The movie also contains a slightly shocking scene (by 1949 standards) which implies that a drunken Cagney and Mayo are about to go off to have sex as they leave the room where O'Brien and other gang members are sitting.This film doesn't glamorize crime at all. The gang here is never able to use the funds they steal, so to them, it is all basically nothing but green paper with dead presidents on it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When the strict enforcement of the Hollywood Production Code began in 1934, the studios got themselves in a tizzy trying to satisfy the public demand for gangster pictures, whilst simultaneously trying to satisfy the code's stipulations that they not glorify a life of crime. And yet try as they might, pictures like Angels with Dirty Faces and The Roaring Twenties still made the gangster way look temptingly good fun, with the gangsters themselves (played in those examples by James Cagney) beguilingly charismatic. Ironically, it was only in the following decades, when interpretation of the code was becoming increasingly liberal and public taste was judged to be a little less sensitive, that we saw gangster movies which were truly unglamorous through their sheer gritty portrayals.White Heat earned writer Virginia Kellogg the first of her two Oscar nominations for Best Story, and the real strength of Kellogg's work is her great characterisation. Her Cody Jarrett is everything the 30s gangsters were ? tough but intelligent, as good with words as he is with a gun. And yet he has his little idiosyncrasies ? his crippling headaches, his creeping insanity, not to mention his mother fixation, all of which seem bound up with his criminal career, and make him both a despicable and terrifying character, someone we would neither want to emulate nor be associated with. But Kellogg has also given us a hero in the Edmund O'Brien character. Fallon/Pardo is clever and resourceful, but good with his fists too, just like the classic gangster heroes, albeit with a slightly more reliable moral compass. O'Brien's position as a mole in Jarrett's gang is what gives the story its excitement. His pluckiness makes us root for him, and Jarrett's cunning and merciless nature provide the element of danger.Someone who knew a thing or two about excitement is director Raoul Walsh. Walsh keeps up a frenzied rhythm, involving us the audience in the action. A lot of the movement is not across the screen, but towards the camera, particularly those of James Cagney who is almost constantly advancing upon us. Shots are composed with an emphasis on narrowness. For example, the cramped four-man jail cell is mostly shot from the back, so the beds on either side form a little corridor, so again that movement in depth seems the only one possible. Many of the shots seeming matched together to keep a continual feeling of movement. The titles of these classic gangster movies often relate only vaguely to the story, and seem more or less interchangeable, but thanks to Walsh this one at least has an appropriately white hot intensity.Cagney himself is naturally the central focus of White Heat. Although this is one of his most iconic roles his acting is a little hammier and more clichd than his wonderfully understated turn in Angels with Dirty Faces a decade earlier, hence no Oscar nomination. Still, after a long hiatus away from the crime movie, he proves that with his sharp delivery and hypnotic presence he is still the archetypal screen gangster. He also proves himself able to portray Jarrett's insanity with smooth creepiness, the standout scene being the one in the forest where he tells O'Brien he's been talking to his ma. The slicked back hair he often sports in White Heat (as oppose to his usual blond fluff) is even a bit reminiscent of Anthony Hopkins's look in Silence of the Lambs. Having made his name as the ultimate glamorous gangster, Cagney finally got to turn the gangster back into a villain.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When it comes to gangsters, nobody could play 'em quite like James Cagney. 'White Heat (1949)' is often considered to feature his finest performance, and the film certain delivers the promised thrills and suspense. Disturbed, violent and volatile, Cody Jarrett is a dangerous crook with a short fuse, and, for the dedicated undercover detective who has secured the criminal's trust, a single blunder could betray his identity, and the game would be up. Raoul Walsh, who had directed Cagney on three previous occasions, was well-versed in the gangster genre, and had already imbued it with shades of early noir in the star-making Humphrey Bogart picture, 'High Sierra (1941).' Cagney, after acclaimed performances in 'The Public Enemy (1931),' 'Angels with Dirty Faces (1938)' and 'The Roaring Twenties (1939),' had taken a decade-long recess from playing a gangster, and, as Cody Jarrett, he exploded onto the screen with more intensity than ever. Exhibiting an unhealthy intimacy with his overbearing mother, Jarrett's extreme mental sickness is most memorably observed in his final deranged words: "Made it, Ma. Top of the world!"Unlike some gangster pictures, which tend to take a few minutes to swing into gear, 'White Heat' opens with a daring railway robbery, in which Jarrett and his gang murder four innocent men and flee with thousands of dollars in cash. In order to escape the gas chamber, the master-criminal surrenders to the authorities and claims responsibility for a minor hotel heist, receiving 1-3 years imprisonment but eluding suspicions that he played a role in the bloody train robbery. The detectives in charge, however, remain unconvinced, and dedicated undercover agent Hank Fallon (Edmond O'Brien) is sent to the prison to gain Jarrett's trust and acquire evidence of his involvement in the crime. Meanwhile, opportunistic femme fatale, Verna (Virginia Mayo), plays a deadly game with treacherous associate Big Ed (Steve Cochran), while Jarrett's predatory mother (Margaret Wycherly) seethes ominously in the shadows. When Jarrett and a gang of lackeys stage an exciting jail-break, Fallon attempts to alert the authorities to his latest movements ? but this felon isn't going to take failure lying down.'White Heat' played an important role in the development of the heist picture sub-genre, and, like Walsh's 'High Sierra (1941)' years earlier, paved the way for the classic and influential narrative formula to be found in John Huston's 'The Asphalt Jungle (1950).' With Cagney always brimming with pent-up violent energy, his character consistently maintains a state of extreme volatility ? his mental breakdown during the prison meal is gripping and realistic ? and, as a result, the story never allows the viewer to flag their concentration. Edmond O'Brien is also excellent as the honest undercover investigator who earns Jarrett's trust before betraying it, and there's a wonderful moral ambiguity in the sense that we, as the audience, have grown so attached to the charismatic and unpredictable villain that we're almost cheering for his success. That Cody Jarrett is doomed from the very beginning is a fact forever present in our minds, and that's what makes his inevitable downfall even more tragic, devastating and unforgettable. At that moment, James Cagney really was at the top of the world.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of James Cagney's last gangster roles is also his most easily remembered, not to mention his best. Spoiled with an outstanding supporting cast, he's able to cut loose as the remorseless, cackling villain Cody Jarrett, a flawed mastermind with two buckets full of emotional baggage. The film's plot is both simple and involved, with two very basic heist tales at heart and a whole slew of gripping tentacles that tie every footnote and aside into the big picture at its explosive finale. It's also completely unfazed by the idea of killing off major cast members - perhaps because there are so damn many of them - as it does so with no lack of glee or emphasis. Outside of the very opening scene (a train caper that doesn't exactly go according to plan) the plot is basically one long, bad idea that slowly, brilliantly unfolds into the inevitable climactic shootout. Easy to follow and to enjoy, it accepts no excuses from any perspective.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Right from 'Regeneration' every Raoul Walsh film is a must-see. Nevertheless, I find this picture a weaker effort of his. Which is not to say I don't love it as much as everybody else, but I found some of it's plotting unnecessarily slapdash, and get the feeling it was over-polished in the editing and left the lot with the tires overinflated for maximum box office appeal. The "Top of the world, Ma!"- Jimmy Cagney classic is actually not as old as I'd thought, released in 1949. One of those great albeit deeply unconvincing Edmond O'Brien roles as a narc who gets in too close with Cagney. Two things are noteworthy about this movie. First is that the big score scheduled for the end of the film is premised upon the idea that a large chemical firm pays its numerous employees in cash on payday. This struck me as mighty unlikely. Then again, maybe I'm the crazy one and paychecks are less than 60 years old. And to my jaded astonishment O'Brien's character also lets fly with "we got him by the short hairs!" complete with finger motions; was Hayes' out sick? Mind bogglingly risqu for its time, I felt, and nearly subliminal in its inclusion. Several other instances beggar belief; yet they are balanced out by our understanding of them as psychologically relevant character details, and a wealth of other more satisfying scenes. Really, I think the family dynamic, particularly in the first half of the film, show Walsh's greatness: the tension between Ma &amp; the Moll, both in the hideout and down at the precinct: fabulous. There seems to be some nuanced Freudian symbolism in Cody's use of a Trojan horse in his final caper; moreover a great deal of attention is paid by everyone to Cody's mercurial inner states. In the end, the hyper-industrialized landscape of the chemical factory where Cody's apotheosis takes its eponymous place as a fireball in the sky, is also seen to be where the White Heat's original genius loci inside Cody's head (in the form of both his devastating self-inflicted migraines, and raging criminal ambitions) turns inside out, transmuted to spectacular combustion, sheer effect. "Top of the world, Ma!" is revealed as an incantation.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An extraordinary gangster film, Raoul Walsh's "White Heat" leaves the old cinematic theory about "angels with dirty faces" in the dust, and points directly to the psychotic "natural born killers" of the future. James Cagney (as Arthur "Cody" Jarrett) plays the anti-heroic cold-blooded killer with, as he describes, "a red hot buzz-saw inside my head." Watch out for his prison rampages. That Cagney is no longer a dirty-faced angel is a point driven home, marvelously, by mother Margaret Wycherly (as "Ma" Jarrett). Don't miss her looks of approval, as they are almost as lethal as Cagney's gun. Ms. Wycherly certainly proves Cagney is a chip off the old block. He's naughty by nature. Wycherly's a mother replaced in prison by the infiltrating Edmond O'Brien (as Hank Fallon aka "Vic Pardo").Early in the film, note the glances between Cagney's pretty wife Virginia Mayo (as Mrs. Verna Jarrett) and gang member Steve Cochran (as "Big Ed" Somers), as they reveal much about an important plot development. Showing more of these characters' off-screen activities (while Cagney is in prison) would have improved the film; it seems like there might have been some scenes cut (or, perhaps, never filmed). Also, re-dubbing to correct some distracting errors would not, even now, spoil the film's integrity; replacing the calling of "Garrett" with "Jarrett" would be a good place to start.Virginia Kellogg's intriguing story received some "Academy Award" consideration. It's hard not to notice Wycherly telling Ms. Mayo, "there's plenty you can do without wearing out the mattress." But the frightening and intense Cagney (as "Best Actor") and mother Wycherly (as "Best Supporting Actress") were curiously slighted; perhaps, Hollywood felt crime shouldn't be encouraged.********* White Heat (9/2/49) Raoul Walsh ~ James Cagney, Virginia Mayo, Margaret Wycherly, Edmond O'Brien</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As he practically invented the gangster genre with "The Public Enemy", "Angels with Dirty Faces", and "The Roaring Twenties", it was only right for James Cagney to reunite with director Raoul Walsh for "White Heat", the last great gangster film of the 30's and 40's. Cagney plays Cody Jarrett, a sadistic hood with a fixation for his mother (Margaret Wycherley). In jail, Cody befriends another inmate (Edmond O'Brien) who, unbeknownst to Cody, is actually an undercover cop with the job of infiltrating the Jarrett gang and discovering where Cody hid loot from a train robbery. After breaking out of jail, Cody kills Big Ed, a gang member who has killed Cody's mother and run off with Cody's girl (Virginia Mayo). With the gang back together, Cody prepares for a big score, unaware that the police are right on his heels. As with so many gangster flicks, "White Heat" relies on the appeal of the genre, along with the strong performance from its leading man. Cagney is terrific as always, and the supporting cast does a great job as well. The ending, when Cody delivers his famous "Made it, Ma. Top of the World" before being blown to bits, is quite famous. As a whole, "White Heat" is about as good a way as any to close out one of the great genres of cinema as any. You'll feel on top of the world after you watch this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>White Heat (1949)It's hard to find an actor more natural, and electric, than James Cagney. You might not like him as much in some of his lighthearted movies, but boy is he the likable/fearsome criminal to perfection. I'd hate to pick the best of his gangster films, but White Heat must be right there, especially for his edgy performance.But there's more. The filming, for one, is so fast and alive and filled with that famous Warner Brothers shadowy look, it's easy to get sucked in just for ambiance. The other characters, almost necessarily secondary to Cagney, are really superb, especially (for me) Virginia Mayo, who isn't quite the stereotype of the pretty girl caught up in a gangster's world, and is convincing and different. Director Raoul Walsh, who has a huge string of amazing, moody, and very human dramas (including Cagney's Twentieth Century from a decade earlier) pulls off the crime plot with a kind of physical brutality, as well as visual ingenuity, that is totally fresh, even for the late 1940s when the standards of hard-boiled anything were really high.This is one of those rare films you can see with high expectations and not be a bit disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best gangster movie of them all</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the few gangster films that refuses to compromise or to romanticize gang leaders, "White Heat" is superior on all levels. James Cagney portrays Cody Jarrett as a homicidal maniac with a mother fixation that makes Norman Bates look like a pussycat. Why Cagney was not even nominated for an Academy Award when he gives one of the finest performances in screen history will forever remain a mystery. His exceptional acting is nearly matched by Margaret Wycherly as Cody's demented, possessive mother; Virginia Mayo as Cody's gun moll, Verna, continually berated and abused by Jarrett, both verbally and physically; Steve Cochran as dimwitted yet handsome and ambitious Big Ed, having a clandestine fling with Verna; and Fred Clark as a shadowy boss figure known as The Trader. Only Edmond O'Brien as a police plant, Hank Fallon, aka Vic Pardo, worming his way into Jarrett's favors, as a substitute for Cody's mother following her murder by Big Ed, seems out of place. Usually a capable actor as in the classic noir thriller, "D.O.A.," O'Brien never quite scales the Thespian heights reached by the other leads.Even the title adds to the total effect of this cinematic masterpiece. "White heat" is physical as when the train steam graphically scalds a gang member. "White heat" is allegorical, representing on one level the torment, hostility, and ruthlessness that motivates Cody and the other members of his gang. "White heat" burns Cody's mind causing headaches that unleash the wild beasts inside, giving him mad fits of uncontrollable destructiveness. Ultimately, it is white heat that destroys Cody and provokes his last bloodcurdling scream, "Made it, Ma! Top of the world!" Director Raoul Walsh should have ended the film at this point. The final remark made by Hank Fallon is anticlimactic and unnecessary.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>WHITE HEAT is admitted to be the last gangster film released during classic Hollywood era, but it is much more than that.I have seen this film several times, first of them dubbed to Spanish (things that happen in Spain), later I could enjoy it in its original version which made it a lot more interesting.Despite its quality, I would like to point out only a sequence (avoiding to be boring), it is when Cody Jarret (Cagney) was in jail working in the iron smelting and a guy tried to kill him. First, we see a general shoot to open the sequence and allow us to locate the place; next, a series of detailed shoots reveals the essential elements of the plot (Cagney, his "killer", the engine which is going to be thrown at him, O'Brien who realizes what is going to happen, etc.), the editing is superb and so is the setting.I would like to point out the impressive interpretation of a psychopathic gangster by Cagney (who else would have been better for this role?), the superb interpretation by Margaret Wycherly as Cody's mother and the rest of the cast (O'Brien, Mayo), the great direction by Walsh, the terrific script and screenplay and the very well fitted soundtrack. As a matter of fact, everything is perfect!!! A highly influential film which trace you can smell on other gangster-like films such as Goodfellas, The Godfather, Chinatown, etc.Finally, the final scene when Cagney claims "Made it ma, top of the world!!!!" is an excellent ending for this film. Anything more to say? Yes, this film is it: TOP OF THE WORLD.An obligation, one of my must sees.</fullReview>

In the female lead we got a sexy and nasty Virginia Mayo as Cagney's character love interest. Also watch for the excellent Edmond O'Brien who gives a perfect performance as the undercover agent who is after Cody. The black and white photography is very impressive for a film that was made in 1949. Two great scenes: The first - the prison dining hall scene where Cody gets the bad news about his mom. The second - is the final famous scene at the factory where Cody finally makes it to top of the world and "...It blew right in his face". Overall a Perfect Crime Film. 10/10</fullReview>

His job is violence, robbery and money. I think that Mr. Cagney is maybe a little too brutal in their roles. In this film, the brutality has reached a peak. Anything else, aloof murder. Certainly not common. Cagney's killing with style. This actor I really miss. I think he's the biggest gangster in the classic Hollywood. My inclination to the floor.The acting is generally good. Virginia Mayo as Verna Jarrett is quite good in the role of unfair wife. Cheeky, horny and stupid. I think that no actress can not be achieved in the role of a femme fatale. Good examples are rare. Beauty generally becomes crucial. Edmond O'Brien as Hank Fallon AKA "Vic Pardo", It's nothing special. Simply good. Resourceful character. His performance has been shaken in the last third of the film.At least likely fact is "mama's boy". This is the motivation main character. However operates unconvincing. If we talk about the disorder in character, he would have functioned perfectly irrespective of the element in the story.Exciting, tense and entertaining thriller. Fans of the genre can enjoy.

I'd go as far as to say it's like Donnie Brasco with action scenes added. The action scenes are pretty good and the film kept my interest all the way even though it's quite a long one. But it is very dated and doesn't really stand the test of time that well. Not for me anyway. The acting is dated and so is the whole production.I wasn't too impressed with James Cagney's performance. I found him quite wooden and hammy. The scene where he loses it in the prison dining hall just made me giggle it was so bad. I'm sure I'm on my own here because reading some of the reviews on IMDb it's heralded as the the finest mob movie ever made. But that's just the way I feel. It was an okay movie but nothing special.

This one was made a decade after the likes of ANGELS WITH DIRTY FACES and THE ROARING TWENTIES and stars the noticeably aged star as a small-time criminal who ends up doing time in jail after a robbery goes awry.What follows is a thriller resplendent with solid performances, high drama, a great score, and some wonderfully enjoyable characterisations. Obviously the film belongs to Cagney, who relishes the part of the mother-fixated crime boss and rarely lets up from his on-screen intensity. The bit everyone remembers about WHITE HEAT is the climax, with one of the most famous scenes (and lines) in film history, and it really is perfection. But up until this point we get solid thrills, an interesting police procedural investigation, and some nice little set-pieces in a prison setting. It's all great stuff and one of the best of its era in my opinion.</fullReview>

When one of the gang members is injured in the heist he is happy to have him whacked.His beautiful blonde wife is treacherous and afraid of him. Its more than hinted he beats her up regularly. His right hand man wants him out of the way and wants his wife too. The only person he cares for his his mother. played by Margaret Wycherly. We never find out too much for the course of this close bond between mother and son. Jarret has one other problem, bouts of shooting pain in his head leading to blinding headaches.Edmond O'Brien plays the undercover cop who befriends Jarrett in prison and becomes a member of his gang in order to catch him in the act and find other more secretive gangsters.The film has a mix of noirish crime thriller with a documentary style of shooting and a deep cover genre film as O'Brien bonds with Jarrett in order to be trusted by him and then later betray him.The film is a classic, I think the film suffers because so many aspects are left unexplored because of censorship laws of the time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Pivotal Theme</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No need to recap the plot. The opening scene is a train roaring at us, and soon proves that it never stops roaring at us. Except its name is Cagney, and this is one of his riveting signature roles. His Cody Jarrett commands the screen as few others have, an unforgettable character who puts a whole new slant on mother love. However, the scene that unnerves me more than the seizures or cold- blooded killings is the quiet one in the forest with the escaping Pardo. There Cody mentions he's been in the woods talking with his dead mother, just another breakfast table topic. If I were Pardo, I'd run to the nearest mountain and let the cops find another stooge.Actually, my purpose is to suggest why, despite his many cruelties, Jarrett comes off in an oddly sympathetic fashion. Not that he's admirable, but maybe as to why we exult along with him in that explosive final scene. Basically, I think, it's because the movie appears to be about betrayal. Now, if you think about it, Jarrett's the only main character who doesn't betray somebody else in treacherous fashion. Sure, Pardo's acting for law and order, but he still tricks Jarrett into thinking he's his friend, an act of deception, at best. And of course there's Big Ed and Verna, treacherous to the core. But not Cody. He stays true to what he told his beloved Ma, and by golly when he makes it to the top, he announces his pact with her to the world. Jarrett may be cruel, but he's also steadfastly honest in his own way. It's a brilliantly written, staged, and performed moment, carried out with the panache only Cagney could bring.Anyhow, it's an easily overlooked aspect to an iconic film with a genuinely bizarre character. Kudoes to a production team that took a big risk with a movie that's still an oddball winner.</fullReview>

The dynamic film, with both film noir and documentary-style elements, is characterized by an increased level of violence and brutality along with classical Greek elements.The melodramatic, Freudian-based crime film is enhanced by the musical score of Max Steiner and the frantic pacing brilliantly served up by the director, Raoul Walsh. Walsh did four films with Cagney, but is probably best know for High Sierra starring Humphrey Bogart.This was Cagney's first gangster film role in ten years.I remember Cody's old, hawkish mother (Margaret Wycherly) from Sergeant York. She was amazing in that film. She doesn't like Cody's voluptuous blonde wife Verna (Virginia Mayo). There is some great dialog between them.And, of course, there is the the apocalyptic finale as he dies in a blaze of glory at the "top of the world".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film's technical aspects are solid, such as Max Steiner's scoring and Sidney Hickox's camera work, which does not rely on close-ups, rather emphasizing the greater picture; but neither is the compelling feature that one finds in the best films noir; another reason this film fails that claim. The screenplay, by Ivan Goff and Ben Roberts, from a tale by Virginia Kellogg, is good, but not great. Like many of the same era thrillers by Alfred Hitchcock it is larded with too much Freudianism and not enough realism (note how Fallon assumes the role of Jarrett's confessor and benefactor after he learns Ma Jarrett is dead). Still, given that it was coming out at a time when the 1930s gangster film era was fading, the genre had to go somewhere. Also, the film, while it does a good job in setting Fallon up as the mole, meanders too much. The whole Big Ed-Verna romance is overdone because it's obvious that Big Ed has no chance against Jarrett, and the whole Ma-Jarrett relationship, like that, a decade later, in Psycho, is just a bit too forced. In fact, it gets to the point that Ma, not Verna, can be seen as the femme fatale in Jarrett's life that leads him to doom (even as she is dead), one of the few points one can argue in favor of White Heat being a film noir. The best part of the film is the acting. Wycherly, as Ma, is very good, and Edmond O'Brien shows why he was an Oscar caliber actor in a very good portrayal of Fallon/Pardo. But, as usual in his films, Cagney not only is brilliant, but he dominates the screen. It's interesting to note that the 1950s saw the rise of the Method Acting style, yet almost all of the discernible physical inflections of that style were present in Cagney's role here, as well as in earlier roles. In fact, I would argue that Cagney was not only the most influential actor in American film history (for look how much of Method Madness stole from him), but also the most important and nonpareil (if not perhaps the best) for look how many imitators Brando and De Niro have had, but who can do Cagney without falling lamely short? This is because Cagney is not aiming for realism in his performances, but feelism- he aims to make the viewer feel things, not be uplifted.White Heat is not a great piece of cinema, but it's damned good. It's a bit too reliant upon the formulae of gangster films to break too much new ground, but it is crisp, taut, and there are only a few moments that are lulls. There is no higher ideal being trumpeted, but what little music it plays it plays well, as a great genre piece of cinema. Yet, oddly, unlike Cagney's earlier gangster classic, The Public Enemy, this film, while more realistic, in terms of its science and the politics of crime, is less realistic, in terms of its characters' motivations and development. Still, it's a treat to watch, and far above what passes for action or thriller fare today. In terms of being able to pull off a tough guy role, yet still move a viewer, Cagney was and is is still king!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the greatest performances in movie history</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Most works of art and entertainment are very much products of their era. They may be significant for that particular moment in time but when that moment is over, their relevance fades no matter how good they may be. Then there are some things that outlast their era and achieve a timeless importance. Finally, there are some timeless things that go beyond that and become more significant as the years pass. White Heat fits into that last category.It's the story of Cody Jarrett (James Cagney), the leader of a criminal gang in post-WW II California with limitless rage, vicious headaches and an abnormally close relationship with his evil mother. The film begins with Cody and company robbing a train carrying $300,000, killing anyone who gets in their way but having one of the gang badly burned by a blast of steam. Cody orders his gang to hold up for weeks in a isolated house in the wilderness, keeping a lid on the complaints of his wife Verna (Virginia Mayo) and one of his gang, Big Ed (Steve Cochran). When Cody decides it's time to leave the hideout, he orders the death of their burned comrade, but one of the gang only pretends to kill him. That act of mercy turns out to be the break the authorities need to track down Cody. But before they can arrest him, Cody falsely confesses to another crime in Illinois to give him an alibi for the train robbery and avoid the gas chamber for those murders. But they law never gives up. They send an undercover agent (Edmund O'Brien) into the Illinois prison to get close to Cody and find enough information on him to put the gangster down once and for all. The agent, Hank Fallon, finds it hard to get close to Cody, even after he saves his life from a hit ordered by Big Edt. But Cody finally lets Fallon into his confidence and after Ma Jarrett (Margaret Wycherly) dies, Cody leads Fallon and a group of convicts to escape from prison. After taking care of Big Ed, Cody and his fellow escapees hook up with the rest of the Jarrett gang and plan to rob the payroll at a chemical plant. Fallon manages to alert the authorities to the robbery, however, and as police flood into the plant and pick off gang one by one, Cody Jarrett is madly defiant to the end.When a film is this great, you can be brutally honest about it. Like many films made so long ago, there are many aspects of it which aren't that impressive to the modern eye. Most of the characters are flat and two-dimensional. The cops, especially, are never anything more than heroic cyphers straight out of Dragnet. Even Ma Jarrett is less than you might expect. The idea of the character is powerful and compared to the prevailing images and understanding of motherhood of its day, it's shocking. But viewed from the standards and thinking of today, it's a fairly simple and shallow performance. Virginia Mayo is a bit better than that, playing a beautiful but amoral woman who might care about Cody and money and other things, but nothing nearly so much as she cares about herself.The story itself is fast moving without ever seeming breathless and there are some police procedural elements to it that hold up fairly well. The plot manages to throw plenty of barriers in front of both Cody and the cops to keep the dramatic tension going. I t's also a great looking black and white movie without appearing too obviously stylized. But measured against the roller coaster thrill rides of today's films, many folks might find it lacking.What makes White Heat one those films that everyone should see, even more than half a century after its debut, is the astounding acting job of James Cagney. Some folks look at Cody Jarrett as sort of the capstone to all of the gangster roles Cagney had played in his career, but even if you've never seen another Cagney movie, you will be astounded at his work here. He creates a human being who is a bundle of anger and insanity and white hot steam. Cagney was short and this film does nothing to disguise that most of the other actors are much taller than he is. But there's not a single moment when you doubt that Cody Jarrett is more than a match for every other man on screen combined.What makes Cagney's work even more amazing is when you consider the state of American and movie culture when he did it. It was still a time when movies, even the great ones, were rather contrived and very much in the realm of make believe. The realistic depiction of human emotion and behavior was not a priority to the storytellers of that day, especially any honest look at the dark heart of humanity. But Cagney's Cody Jarrett is as real and as shocking and as emotionally powerful as any performance that came in the decades that followed it. Americans had been watching gangster movies for years, but this was the best look they had ever been given into the twisted soul of criminal evil, and little if anything has ever surpassed it .While there are elements of it that may appear dated, White Heat remains a great film that everyone ought to see. If only to think about what it had to have been like for the audience of that era to think they were going to see "another Cagney gangster flick" and get punched in the face by a performance that still feels modern this long after it was done.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cagney turns up the heat</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"White Heat" is generally regarded as one of the best gangster films of all time. Additionally, many hold that Cagney's performance here is the finest of his career. While my own opinion is tempered somewhat on both counts I still feel that "White Heat" is a classic.James Cagney takes on an interesting role here, playing gangster 'Cody' Jarrett, a psychotic with a mother fixation. Feeling the heat from a recent robbery he gives himself up to the law for a lesser crime in another state. In prison, external forces soon provoke Jarrett into planning a daring escape.Cagney turns in a fine performance but I think that by this time he was getting a bit old for this type of gangster role. More memorable, to my mind, is Margaret Wycherly's performance as Jarrett's tough-as-nails mother; a performance that's quite a departure from her Oscar-nominated performance in "Sergeant York". As for the other stars, Virginia Mayo capably fills the role of the gangster's moll and Edmond O'Brien turns in a suitably tough performance as an undercover cop.Raoul Walsh's direction is well-handled but not extraordinary and the same could be said for Max Steiner's score. The writing received an Oscar nomination (the film's only nomination), which I'd have to admit was warranted. The script's clever plotting, attention to detail and unique twists elevate it above the usual, more formulaic offerings.In the end, though, while "White Heat" certainly has some aspects that elevate it above the usual gangster movie fare I still wouldn't count it as one of the very finest examples of the genre. It may be a classic but it's still a ways off from the likes of "The Godfather", "GoodFellas" or even "Miller's Crossing".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>should have been better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A promising beginning, in fact super-promising, opening with Cagney and boys robbing a moving train, it is full of suspense and even horror as one of the gang gets scalded. Cagney's character is a throwback to the days when insanity was an inherited trait. However, Margaret Wycherly as his mother, has a great part, but unfortunately it was nixed too soon at the expense of telling the more mundane story of Cagney and O'Brien (a police plant whose job is to gain Cagney's confidence). O'Brien had a similar role in Siodmak's The Killers, which also did in that film. This movie loses a significant part of its focus on the gang and gets caught up in this elaborate and distracting police trap, a part of the plot which pales in comparison to the other part with Cagney, his mother (Wycherly), the great Steve Cochran and impressively sexy Virginia Mayo as they're first on the run, and second imploding with the twisted relationships and dormant violence that seems about to erupt.</fullReview>

Undercover agent Hank Fallon (Edmond O'Brien) is able to infiltrate the gang by being in the Illinois State Penitentiary.There is a static procedural feel about some of the movie along with some fun gangster action.

		<shortDescription>Cut Those Apron-Strings...Or Become A Whimpering Worm</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fast paced crime thriller that is slowed down by the dated "scientific" explanations of the new surveillance and technology. After WWII scientists and the Government could do no wrong. But it does not make for a tight fit when a lot of post war films felt the need for a display of American ingenuity and an announcement to all criminals and countries...The USA is on top of the world.Cagney's mobster can now represent, in the new wave, the "new" Noir criminal with severe psychological problems. The screen can also be lit up with a more personalized violence (as Jarrett tells an enemy in the trunk of a car... "can't breathe, let me give you some air").It is a creepy Ma that is the only person our anti-hero can show any honor or humanity. The portrayal as ugly and looking and speaking like a witch, rather than a sympathetic Mother figure, is also a statement that Men, in this post-modern world, have no need for Mom any more and it is better to cut those apron strings or become a whimpering worm. Real Men have no need for such tenderness.This is an unforgettable film filled with a rapid spattering of memorable lines and gun-play. A good supporting cast and a fitting chemical (Atomic-like) explosive ending.P.S. Although many think that this is James Cagney's best gangster performance...check out Kiss Tomorrow Goodbye (1950) for comparison.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the great American crime films, Raoul Walsh's White Heat (1949) stars James Cagney as Arthur 'Cody' Jarrett, leader of a gang of armed robbers, and a swaggering, psychopathic mother's boy in the thrall of his devoted but equally heartless 'Ma', played by Margaret Wycherly. His leadership challenged by 'Big' Ed (Steve Cochran), infuriated by the infidelity of his sluttish wife Verna (Virginia Mayo), and plagued by crippling migraine attacks, Jarrett's fate is sealed when his gang is infiltrated by Treasury agent Hank Fallon (Edmond O'Brien)... Nominally based on the exploits of 'Doc' Barker and the infamous Barker gang, the movie transcends its real-life inspiration to mesh elements of Greek tragedy with almost documentary-style realism and moments of genuine humour. The performances are all faultless, whilst the action sequences mix thrilling energy with wonderful black comedy (notably in the infamous car boot scene). After hurtling towards one of the most celebrated climaxes in film history, the movie finally hits a sublime high with Jarrett's triumphant cry of 'Made it Ma, top of the world!', amongst the explosive surroundings of a chemical plant. Interestingly, audience sympathy is skewed totally in the villain's direction in White Heat, as Cagney, one of the most universally popular leading men in Hollywood history, amazingly manages to make his essentially repellent character not only sympathetic, but actually likable. Though a remorseless criminal and a cold-blooded murderer, he is a typically witty, energetic, Cagney creation, and the odds are so stacked against the doomed Jarrett that the audience inevitably sides with him. Presumably, the viewer is meant to relate to the O'Brien character, but Fallon is an annoyingly multi-skilled 'super cop' who is not only an 'undercover expert', uncaringly winning and then betraying Jarrett's trust, but also an electronics genius, and most annoyingly of all, a sharp-shooting sniper who is handed a rifle at the movie's end and unhesitatingly shoots Jarrett in cold blood; It is interesting to compare Jarrett's death with the demise of Humphrey Bogart's Roy 'Mad Dog' Earle in Walsh's High Sierra (1941); another hunted murderer, and a similarly tragic figure, Earle is eventually killed by an anonymous rifle-wielding posse, meaning that we know nothing about those who kill him, and he remains the audience's sole focal point even after his death. When watching White Heat, I find myself unable to come to terms with Fallon's state of mind as he shoots the out-gunned Jarrett dead, and I am unsure what the filmmakers intended the audience's reaction to be; but for me, it exemplifies the tragedy at the movie's heart and its portrayal of all the characters in shades of grey; Fallon's final, murderous act is not heroic, and in comparison, Jarrett's defiant, deranged shooting frenzy appears almost admirable. As an anti-heroic crime movie protagonist, Arthur 'Cody' Jarrett has no equal.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Explosive Cagney Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After creating the urban thug eighteen years earlier in Public Enemy James Cagney plays the criminal in winter Cody Jarrett in one of Warner Brothers last great cops and robbers films White Heat. Rather than mellow with age Cagney's Jarret is the most brutal of his career, featuring arguably the greatest exit in film history. Jarrett is leader of a vicious gang that includes assorted mugs, his moll and his mother. He beats a murder rap by taking the fall and doing time for a lesser crime. In prison he is befriended by an undercover cop who breaks out with Jarrett and joins up with the gang. Suffering from migraines, a straying wife and most importantly his mother's demise while in prison, Cody puts more trust in the informer Vin Prado (Edmond O'Brien) whose cover isn't blown until the gang is in the middle of a chemical plant payroll heist.Heat is classic Warner Brothers crime film, tough, loud and brazen. Workhorse director Raoul Walsh keeps the action moving and suspenseful throughout as Jarrett and the gang violently conduct their business of crime and mayhem. Cagney, who had already given three (Public Enemy, Angels with Dirty Faces, The Roaring Twenties) of the most memorable gangster performances in film history equals if not eclipses them with a much more complex (and more cold blooded if that's possible) performance of a gang leader with tragic floors. With mom in tow and his Oedipal complex evident for all to see it makes for some jolting imagery as the cold blooded Jarrett sits in her mothers lap seeking relief from his migraines and Ma treating him like he was still in grade school. But she's every bit as tough as her Cody if not as trigger happy. As mom, Margaret Wycherly gives a convincing and unsettling performance while a brassy Virgina Mayo and slick Steve Cochran register as double crossing connivers. Action director Walsh provides his usual expertise in providing crisply edited gripping and chaotic scenes of action but he also allows Cagney to stretch Jarrett in directions unseen in film before and the results are startling even for today.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the first great heist movies.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I would foremost classify this movie as an heist movie. It's obviously one that would go on and inspire many later movies and film-makers in the movie. Many elements in this movie are still being used in similar type of movies, even this present day.It's not the usual Cagney gangster flick, it's one with perhaps some more story and character building behind it. Unlike previous movies in its genre it's not really one made purely for entertainment. This can mostly been seen back in the movie its main character, who is a borderline mental patient, with a more than big admiration for his mother. This character is of course being played by James Cagney, who throughout his career has played many gangster type of roles but perhaps none of them were as complicated and psychotic as Cody Jarrett. The movie some real great, effective and memorable sequence in it, which all have to do with Cagney's fabulous and powerful acting performance of the movie.The movie its story has a real Martin Scorsese and Quentin Tarantino vibe to it, in which an undercover cop infiltrates in the criminal network led by the Cagney character and teams up with him for his next criminal plan, after having escaped from prison together, with a bunch of other henchman. It's a story that fits in fine within its genre and it of course gets greatly told with the help of the actors and director Raoul Walsh.This was not the first time director Walsh and actor Cagney teamed up together. They made four movies together, of which this one was their third.A great early heist movie, that marked the end of the real film-noir gangster movie and marked the era of the new, more modern type of gangster movie.9/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

The supporting cast lead by Virginia Mayo, Edmond O'Brien, Steve Cochran and Margaret Wycherly is spot on perfect.

		<fullReview>James Cagney was around 50 when he did "White Heat," his last gangster movie, and he's as energetic and even meaner than he was in 1931.This 1949 film was directed by Raoul Walsh and also stars Virginia Mayo, Edmond O'Brien, Steve Cochran and Margaret Wycherly. Cagney plays Cody Jarrett, a career criminal who is involved in a train robbery in which four people were killed. He escapes prison by turning himself in for a lesser crime someone else committed at the same time and getting only a couple of years in prison. He leaves behind his wife (Mayo) who is cheating on him with a member of his gang (Cochran) and also his beloved mother (Wycherly), who's as big an outlaw as he is. In prison, he meets Vic Pardo (O'Brien) who is actually an undercover G man trying to get evidence that Cody committed the other crime.This is an excellent film and quite a violent one, with an atmosphere evocative of real criminal life. Jarrett is absolutely depraved, killing anybody in his way without so much as blinking. He's prone to getting terrible attacks which render him helpless - could be a brain tumor or something inherited, as he says his father was crazy and institutionalized. Not surprising.When Ma visits Cody in prison, sacrilegious though it might be, I chuckled thinking about the scene in "Dead Men Don't Wear Plaid" where Steve Martin plays a more broad-shouldered Ma, wearing an identical dress, and visits Cagney.Two very famous scenes in this film: the scene in the prison dining hall when Cody asks about his mother, and the question is asked down the line of prisoners, and the answer is given up the line until it reaches Cody. The last scene with Cody screaming "Made it, Ma. Top o' the world!" is part of film history.Walsh's direction is clean and right-on, and he keeps the pace brisk, the action constant, and the tension mounting.Don't miss this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An all-time classic...and pretty outrageous for a 1940s gangster pic. James Cagney is a hood with a serious mother fixation. Given that the mother is played by the not-so-nice Margaret Wycherly, it's doubly creepy. He gets himself sent up the river in another state to avoid the chair in California. Cop Edmond O'Brien infiltrates his gang. Virginia Mayo (in a rare bad girl role) plays Cagney's two-timing wife Verna. What could surely fall into camp doesn't thanks to the ruthless direction by Raoul Walsh and a script full of brutal dialog. Cagney is brilliant in a seminal role and the supporting cast is first rate. In addition to Mayo, O'Brien and the always excellent Wycherly (a Brit no less!), the cast includes Fred Clark as one of Cagney's more ingenious cohorts. The ending, rightly so, is a classic!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>White Heat (1949) **** (out of 4)Psychopath criminal Cody Jarrett (James Cagney) does everything his way, which is ruthless and cold-blooded. The only person he will take orders from is his beloved mother (Margaret Wycherly). Cody decides to turn him in for a crime he didn't commit because by doing so he'll only serve a couple years instead of facing the gas chamber for the crime he really committed. The police decide to try and finally capture him for that crime by sending officer Hank Fallon (Edmond O'Brien) into the prison undercover.Raoul Walsh's WHITE HEAT is a terrific throwback to the Warner gangster pictures of the previous decade. Of course, getting Cagney to return to the criminal underworld was the greatest thing that could happen for the film because when you see him you also see the previous films like THE PUBLIC ENEMY and ANGELS WITH DIRTY FACES. Cagney was a genius at playing criminals but what makes this character so special is just how crazy and psychotic he is.The Cody Jarrett character is without question one of the most memorable villains to ever be seen on the big screen and Cagney does a brilliant job with his performance. That typical fast-talking tough guy role is something Cagney nails but there's so much more here including the bizarre and tender relationship with the mother as well as the headaches that the character suffers from. There really isn't another actor with the range of Cagney that could have pulled this off.It also doesn't hurt that he's surrounded by some terrific actors including O'Brien in the role of his friend who of course he doesn't realize is actually a cop. The two men have a great chemistry together and there's no question that O'Brien could play both sides of the law to perfection. Wycherly is wonderful in the role of Ma and really brings that "motherly love" to the performance. Virginia Mayo was never better than she is here as the crooked girlfriend. Steve Cochran is great as one of Cagney's goons.The film is certainly a lot tougher and much darker than most of the crime pictures from this decade. It's clear that this film was able to get away with a much more sinister tone and just look at the opening sequence alone. There's no question that director Walsh wanted the viewer to know that this wasn't your typical gangster movie. WHITE HEAT is violent, funny, over-the-top and just downright entertaining. It's certainly one of the greatest of its kind.</fullReview>

It is a psychological thriller of epic proportions.The dialogue is brilliant and witty, the plot is well woven, the effects are convincing, the acting is marvellous and the ending is apocalyptic.

So i downloaded and watched the movie. And what a movie it is.Even six decades after the movie was made, no movie has ever had(At least in the limited knowledge i have) as many breathtaking car-chases as the ones in this movie which are brilliantly maneuvered by the scriptwriter and the director. The chases are exhilarating. One could not even dream of an old woman eluding three patrol cars and reach her destination without a tail. I felt James Cagney's character was a tad weird but doesn't that curtly describe a psychopath? Cody Jarrett is a psychopathic villain who has no friends, who trusts none but his mother, one who doesn't care for his accomplices and a man of brilliant ideas and strategy that is tantamount to that of the police force in the movie.What amazed me was the way the police assiduously plan and execute and even in the event of one plan going awry, they always come up with a Plan B. A gangster classic in the league of The Godfather I and II.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"White Heat" is an exceptional crime drama based on Virginia Kellogg's Oscar nominated story and directed brilliantly by Raoul Walsh. The action and drama are delivered at great speed throughout but never at the expense of the exposition which remains intact at all times. James Cagney's magnificent portrayal of the mother-fixated, psychopathic gangster, Cody Jarrett is compelling especially as it convincingly depicts his insecurities and weaknesses as well as his normal brash and brutish behaviour.Jarrett is the leader of a gang which robs a train and kills four people in the process. One of the gang, Zuckie (Ford Rainey) is seriously scalded by a sudden release of steam from the side of the train and is taken back to the gang's cabin hideout but remains in constant agony and without any medical attention. Another gang member, Big Ed (Steve Cochran) has ambitions to take over Jarrett's position as gang leader and also has designs on his wife Verna (Virginia Mayo). At this point it also becomes clear what a powerful role Jarrett's mother has in his life. Ma Jarrett (Margaret Wycherly) is the only person he fully trusts and she also comforts him when he has one of his regular, painful and debilitating headaches. When the gang leaves the cabin, Jarrett orders gang member Cotton Valletti (Wally Cassell) to go back and shoot Zuckie. He pretends to follow his orders but actually tells Zuckie that he'll try to get back to help him and shoots a couple of times at the roof.Zuckie is later found dead at the cabin and at the County Morgue the nature of his injuries and other forensic evidence indicate that he was involved in the train robbery and was a member of Jarrett's gang. This leads US Treasury agents and the police to pursue Jarrett and to him deciding to confess to a lesser crime which was committed at the same time as the train robbery. When he's sentenced to a term in prison, he feels that he's provided himself with an excellent alibi so that he can't be charged with being involved in the train robbery or be executed for the killings involved.The US Treasury investigators are not taken in by Jarrett's confession and place an undercover agent Hank Fallon (Edmond O'Brien) in his cell so that he can get Jarrett to incriminate himself and identify a fence called "The Trader" who had expertly laundered the stolen money.In prison Jarrett survives an attempt on his life (which had been arranged by Big Ed) and formulates a plan to escape when he becomes worried after Ma tells him that she intends to take revenge on Big Ed for what he tried to do. Before the escape can be carried out, Jarrett receives news that his mother is dead. Later, he and a small group including Fallon, escape and join the rest of the gang.Fallon who by this time has become a trusted and close ally of Jarrett's, is successful in finding out who "The Trader" is before the gang embark on a payroll robbery at a chemical plant.The spectacular climax to the movie (during which Jarrett screams "Made it Ma! Top of the World") is exceptionally powerful and in its sheer violence and insanity provides an appropriate end to Jarrett's story. His legendary final words are now so well known that they are probably the most famous last words in movie history.Jarrett's existence was certainly not easy when you consider that as well as trying to evade the attentions of the police and Treasury officials, he also had to deal with being betrayed by Big Ed, Verna and Fallon, having an attempt made on his life by a prison inmate and also being hampered by the incompetence of Zuckie, whose actions provoked the two murders that he carried out in the train robbery. In addition, there was the ill judged action of his mother, who, when the gang were keeping a low profile, decided to go to a market where she was recognised and attracted the attentions of the police.A distinctive feature of "White Heat" is the focus that's given to Jarrett's psychological state and the way in which it affected his actions. This provides an interesting and important extra dimension to his character and it's surprising that in the years since this movie was made that there have not been a greater number of gangster movies which have explored this aspect of criminal behaviour.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cagney classic! Is there any better?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>White Heat is a crackerjack thriller, a dynamite drama, and a near-classic "rat" story where a cop, Vic Pardo, is put in the jail cell with Cody Jarrett (yes, his name is Cody, and he's awesome). But for all the panache and professionalism with director Raoul Walsh, with the amazing screenplay, and with the supporting cast being either very good (Virgina Mayo and Edmund O'Brien as Jarrett's wife and Pardo respectively), this is the James Cagney show. He completely steals every scene he's in, and a lot of the time without seeming to try; like with Jack Nicholson, watching Cagney in a scene listening to someone or not seeming to "do" anything is incredibly interesting, and when he turns on, he's ON in capital letters. A scene like the dining hall at the prison, when Jarrett is told some sad news, is about as explosive as any scene in any movie ever, 40s or more modern.It's spectacular to see Cagney in such strong territory. He has a character to work off of that is, admittedly, far more rounded than that of the cops (Pardo is well written but only as much as a cop disguised as a criminal can get) who are all just very bland kinds of characters in these "crime doesn't pay" style narratives. It is the 'mother' thing, as Jarrett clings to his mother Ma Jarrett, which should add a sweet side to his character. But in reality it's a little more terrifying, in a sense, to see a man with so much presence and anger and authority to be this nuts and get these wild epileptic-type headaches. Then again, Cagney is only as worthy as the material he's in, and White Heat posits something cool in the gangster-movie tradition: a criminal evades capture on a train heist and some murders by copping to a totally different crime perpetrated elsewhere that'll give him less prison time, and then tries to figure out a way to break out.From there we get a solid, if a tad predictable, sub-plot with Jarrett's wife on the outside possibly giving in to another, more ruthless and sneaky gangster character, and the lead up to the big climactic job at the chemical/gas plant. And for Walsh, every scene delivers something dramatically satisfying, and often there's a classic car chase (however it might be deliberate like Ma being followed by the cops) or when Cody is in the straight jacket whispering orders, or how (even for 1949, only Gun Crazy comes close) intense the violence and action is, particularly the big final shootout. Bottom line, if you love good, hard-hitting gangster movies and want a change from the usual gang-banger stuff or want a taste of something that is "old-school" but has not shown its age bad at all, White Heat is is. And having just gotten into Cagney, it's hard for me to think of one that will be more exceptional overall.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(Some Spoilers) It's ironic that one of Mad Dog Cody Jarrett's, James Cagney, favorite bedtime story that his Ma, Margaret Wycherly, would lullaby him to sleep with when he was a little was the story of the Trojan Horse. It turned out to be a Trojan Horse in the person of undercover Federal Treasury Agent Hank Fallon/Vic Pardo, Edmond O'Brien,that infiltrated his gang and in the end had Cody done in but without one of the most explosive endings in motion picture history.On the run from the law for a train robbery, that netted him and his gang $300,000.00, and quadruple murder Cody wisely takes the rap for a crime that he didn't commit a hotel holdup in Sprinfield Illinois. Cody does that in order to avoid, after being apprehended by the police, the San Quinten gas chamber.The Feds, FBI and US Treasury, knowing that Cody was responsible for the train robbery, but can't prove it, have undercover agent Hank Fallon become Cody's cell-mate in the Illinois State Penitentiary.Expecting to be out in less then a year Cody gets very apprehensive when his Ma comes to visit him in prison. Ma Jarrett tells her psychotic son that his second in command Big Ed Somers, Steve Cochran, and two-timing wife Verna, Virginia Mayo,are not only screwing behind his back but that Big Ed plans to take over his gang by having him have and unfortunate accident while he's behind bars.Cody was almost killed when one of Big Ed's men Roy Parker, Paul Guilfoyle,had a motor slip,on purpose, and almost crush him to death with his friend and cell-mate Fallon/Pardo saving his life in just the nick of time. It's then that Cody realizes just what a pair of murderous rat finks his wife Verna and her boyfriend Big Ed really are. Cody also knows that his Ma is in danger of getting killed herself if she, like she told him, tries to take the two on singled handedly.It's a short time later when Cody finds out through the prison grapevine that his Ma was dead shot in the back and killed but by his old lady Verna, not Big Ed like he was later made by a terrified Verna to believe. That has Cody crashes out of prison with Fellon/Pardo and a number of his fellow gang members. Cody does take care of business by taking Parker, who tried to murder him, along for the ride to later face his psychotic and cold blooded vengeance in the trunk of the escaped convicts getaway car. Back at the hideout Cody corners, with the help of Verna, a pi**ing in his pants Big Ed blasting him to pieces without realizing, dead men tell no tales, that it was Verna who set Big Ed up who was the one who did his Ma in.Planning a payroll robbery of an oil refinery and chemical plant in San Pedro Cody uses the old Trojan Horse trick to infiltrate the plant, in an empty 5,000 gallon oil truck. Cody doesn't realize that there's a Trojan Horse in his gang Treasury Agent Hank Fallon/Vic Pardo who tipped off the police to reel him and his gang members in. Fallon for his part is exposed as a "Copper" by one of Cody's men Bob Creel, Ian MacDoald, who recognized him as being the guy who once set, like he's now doing to Cody, him up.In one of his most electrifying and maniacal roles ever James Cagney lets it all out, with bullets flying in all directions,as he goes completely berserk in the film "White Heat" final gut and oil spilling climax. With his gang wiped out Cody climbs on top of an giant oil refinery tank and has it out with the police and federal agents. Knowing that there's no way but up, in a flaming oil &amp; chemical explosion, for him Cody insanely as well as bravely holds off dozens of scared to death, and hiding in every crack and crevasse that they can find, lawmen in a final last stand against justice. Cody during the shootout takes some half dozen slugs from a high powered rifle fired by his former prison buddy Vic Pardo/Hank Fallon who had since turned ran and joined the rescuing police.In a last act of defiance Cody standing upright and looking his enemies straight in the eye, unlike them scurrying for cover and hiding below, fires his last bullets into the oil tank igniting it and all the other oil tanks in the refinery blowing them as well as himself to kingdom come.P.S I can just imagine what Arthur "Cody" Jarrett's crazed actions in destroying about a quarter of the US oil supply did to oil and chemical futures had on the country's's commodity and foreign exchanges.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cagney essentially created the modern larger than life mobster character</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"White Heat" is an entertaining and quickly paced gangster film made memorable by James Cagney's absolutely manic performance of Cody Jarrett, the tough small-time crook with a bizarre mother complex. Few actors know how to chew the scenery as effectively as Cagney. He is on screen for almost every scene, which more than makes up for some flaws in the film. Mainly because of him, this has aged much better than other gangster films made by studios at the time. You can see a lot of him in Al Pacino's performance in "Scarface" or Joe Pesci's in "Goodfellas". Cagney essentially created the modern larger than life mobster character.The other performances, while not as memorable as Cagney's, vary. Edmond O'Brien and Virginia Mayo turn in decent performances as the undercover cop and Cagney's abused wife respectively. Much better is Margaret Wycherly as "Ma", the source of many of Jarrett's problems. I wish their relationship had been explored a bit more, but its still shockingly Odepial. If Jarrett wasn't married, this would have probably gotten some complaints from the censors. Raoul Walsh's direction is fine as usual, keeping everything at a very quick pace. While not an absolute masterpiece, "White Heat" is one of the most memorable gangster films. (8/10)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>White Heat is one of the best gangster films ever made. The writers (screenplay by Ivan Goff and Ben Roberts, from a story by Virginia Kellogg), the director (Raoul Walsh) and especially the actors all work together to tell a tight story with deceptive simplicity. It is essentially as empty as the gasoline truck used in the finale, but you don't look for meaning on a roller coaster ride, you go for the thrills.White Heat begins with Cody Jarrett (James Cagney) and his gang stealing $300,000 dollars and killing four people in a surprisingly brutal train robbery. However, the Feds (using fairly modern forensics) quickly determine it was Jarrett's gang that pulled the train job. The police are treated with respect in this film. They are technically competent, insightful and succeed by hard, plodding work. Jarrett is not stupid either and he (temporarily) beats the rap for the train job by confessing to a lesser crime committed on the same day in another state. This lands Jarrett in jail for a measly two years. The Feds know that Jarrett was involved in the train robbery, but lacking any solid proof; they decide to have one of their own men (Edmund O'Brien) go undercover in prison to be Jarrett's cell-mate in the hopes that he'll get them some usable information.While in jail, Jarrett's gang begins to fall apart as Jarrett's girl and Big Ed, plot to take over. Jarrett is warned about this by his mother (played by the tough as nails Margaret Wycherly). Ma decides to help her son by taking care of Big Ed herself and is killed. The scene when Jarrett finds out his Ma is dead is justly celebrated. Cagney goes into a rage that's unbelievable in it's ferocity; punching out several prison guards before he's carried out of the mess hall screaming and kicking. Doing scenes like this is one of the reasons most actors like to play bad guys. The villain is usually written closer to a primitive emotionalism than the hero characters, who have to remain cool under difficult situations.To avenge his Ma's death, Jarrett escapes from the prison with several other cons (including his new best pal, G-Man Edmund O'Brien). Jarrett kills Big Ed and then decides to knock off the payroll of a chemical plant by hiding his crooks in an empty gas truck and driving into the compound like a Trojan Horse. However, the Feds are waiting and White Heat ends in a huge shootout with the gang. A wounded, unrepentant Cody Jarrett shouts from the top of a burning chemical tank, "Made it Ma! Top of the world!" before the tank explodes in a huge fireball. This movie is exciting stuff!The true star of White Heat is James Cagney as Cody Jarrett; a psychopathic, mother-fixated gangster loosely based on Arthur "Doc" Barker, one of Ma Barkers infamous gangsters.It is debatable whether there is any star around today who has the charisma of James Cagney. His tough guy roles have subtleties, yet he's not afraid to be a complete bastard. The only actor around now who can do that and also get by in comedy is James Caan (The Godfather (1972) and Thief (1980) for bad guys, Slither (1975) and Kiss Me Goodbye (1983) for comedies. Caan was even a believable victim in the 1990 film Misery). Many actors have played bad guys, but Cagney and Caan give them a dangerous quality. For instance, Gene Hackman plays them as caricatures, Arnold Swarzennegger with the relentlessness of a machine (can he do anything else?) but true danger, the unpredictability that is truly frightening comes from them. In White Heat, when Cagney's moll Virginia Mayo makes a wisecrack about his mother, he knocks her off her chair. This is truly scary behavior.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting Story, &amp; A Triumph For Cagney</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The story itself is quite interesting, and that plus James Cagney's fine performance make "White Heat" especially memorable. The battle of wits and nerves between gang leader and undercover police officer is well-conceived, producing many tense moments and situations filled with possibilities. The character of Cody Jarrett, while in one sense a 'typical' gangster role for Cagney, provides him with a more complex character, and Cagney succeeds very well in portraying all sides of him. Edmond O'Brien also deserves his share of credit for his portrayal of the undercover lawman who is trying to bring Jarrett down.The early scenes establish Cagney's character as ruthless, uncaring, and wily, yet there are also indications of his weakness and vulnerability. It's quickly made clear that there is a lot going on under the surface. By the time O'Brien's character comes into the story, we know that he'll be up against an unusual adversary. From then on, the story takes several interesting turns, and Cagney continues to develop his character: sometimes brotherly, sometimes sentimental, and sometimes nearly unhinged. In some of the scenes, such as the one in the dining hall, Cagney is particularly good at maintaining the very difficult balance in his character's complicated personality.The story itself moves at a good pace, becoming more intricate without straining plausibility too much, and it builds up to the tense and well-remembered finale. "White Heat" is one of the best movies of its genre, featuring one of the genre's most accomplished performers in one of his best roles.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In a genre that I'm partial to, White Heat stands out. James Cagney is brilliant in the lead, maturing the role he created in 1931's Public Enemy. Margret Wycherley is memorable as his devoted Ma and Virgina Mayo is perfect as the opporutnistic moll. Edmond O'Brien has yet another top notch supporting turn in his resum (see also The Killers, Seven Days in May and his Oscar win for The Barefoot Contessa) Raoul Walsh (They Drive By Night) provides a much more satisfying ending here than he did in the Humphrey Bogart vehicle High Sierra. The ending is chilling thanks to Cagney who already had one of film's most memorable endings in Angels With Dirty Faces. Highest recommendation, 9/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well over 50 years later, White Heat is still not only one of the best gangster films, but one of the best "cop-undercover" films. Everyone is great in this movie and it moves real well. I think by the time this film was made, the genre had really found its niche. There are so many gangster films in the 30s where the actors are all stage actors or veterans of silent films, so they over act to the point of hokiness. This film really sets the standard (being made in the late 40s). It's as entertaining today as it was when it first came out, I'm sure.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cagney Blows the Screen Apart!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is not another actor who could have portrayed Cody Jarrett!! Cagney absolutely goes over the top as the raving psychopath who loves his Mama...he grits his teeth, rolls his eyes and pumps everybody he doesn't like full of hot lead...what a guy! An aging Cagney who was beginning to look paunchy was given another chance with this film to resuscitate his flagging career and he takes full advantage of it. Although it is reported that he didn't think much of the film or his part, he must have changed his mind because he gives the performance of his career and makes all other gangster roles pale in comparison. He brings such electricity to the role that he blows the rest of the cast off the screen....and this is a great supporting cast. Virginia Mayo, slightly cross-eyed (did you ever notice that?) is great as his slutty, unfaithful wife; Edmund O'Brien is perfect as the somewhat bland gang infiltrator (he was great in this kind of role); Steve Cochran is a sleazy Big Ed; and all other support players are right on target. But it is Cagney that will enthrall you with his vibrant, evil and violent playing of a mad killer. It's an actor's workshop on how to grab a role by the teeth and make it your own. There are many great scenes in this film; of course, the finale when Cagney literally explodes off the screen; his killing of the man in the trunk of the car and his psychotic episode in prison when he learns that his beloved Mother is dead. Watch the faces of the extras in this scene. It has been said that they did not know what to expect and were totally amazed at Cagney's reaction and total immersion is his character. It's a masterpiece of acting. So, if you have never seen this film, or if you always thought that James Cagney was just another one of those "old" actors from the 30's, take a gander at this gem and be prepared for THE classic interpretation of a mad killer. It's a dandy!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One looks in vain for a gangster film better than 'White Heat' Brilliant direction, allied to atmospheric photography, are the canvas on which Cagney, in his finest performance ever, has painted a spine-chilling portrait of a mother-fixated psychopath, a character for whom one can feel no sympathy.The story is of little consequence, being merely the vehicle for a virtuoso display of acting talent, exceptional in its range and depth. The film does not attempt to get over a 'message' or offer pseudo-psychological explanations for the actions of Cody Jarrett (Cagney) It does, however, demonstrate that there are forces within the human psyche which are, whatever some may claim, beyond our comprehension, inexplicable within any framework of rationality. The story is, indeed, unexceptional and rather prosaic, but Cagney's performance blazes from the screen, making the story seem almost irrelevant.Full marks to the quality of the supporting cast who, one suspects, realised their good fortune in being able to witness a master at work. Don't miss this one - as near perfection as you'll ever see in this particular genre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jimmy and Raoul on Top of the World</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers ahead.We live in an age of remakes, but I hope they leave "White Heat" alone. Who but Jimmy Cagney could play Cody Jarrett? Who but Raoul Walsh could direct this masterpiece? One cringes at the thought of Alec Baldwin screaming "Top of the world, Ma!" or of Oliver Stone subverting this into a prequel of "Natural Born Killers."  "White Heat", which begins with a bang and ends with a boom, fully lives up to its title. The film burns with Cody Jarrett's fire, which sears nearly everyone before he's through. The outward Cody is a murderous, treacherous fiend, loyal only to his mother. The inner man is even more violent, seized by sudden headaches which plunge him into blind, demented, frightening fits. I can't think of anyone who could even begin to handle this role today, but for Cagney it's a natural. He's completely convincing in every scene and he dominates the other characters even when he's off camera. Raoul Walsh's stunning direction complements Cagney's magnificent performance. In a career which spanned over 50 years, Walsh directed more than his share of hack work, but when he was at his best as in "The Roaring Twenties" or "Objective Burma", he was brilliant. In "White Heat" his style provides the perfect stage for Cagney's crazed Cody. Walsh keeps things moving and never allows the focus to shift from Jarrett's actions to his motivation. He gives the audience some insight into the nature of Cody's insanity, but never to a point where anyone would begin to feel a trace of sympathy for him or become absorbed in examining his psychopathology."White Heat" contains perhaps more memorable set-pieces than any other gangster film - the opening train robbery, the prison mess hall rampage, the car trunk shooting ("Hey Cody, gimme some air."), the death of Big Ed (Steve Cochran), and the classic "Top of the World" finale, to name just five. In each case, the viewer is shocked but also surprised by Walsh's ingenious touches - Cody shooting the engineer below the belt rather than in the head or the heart; the look on Pardo's (Edmond O'Brien) face when Cody erupts and climbs onto the mess table; Cody munching a sandwich just after firing into the trunk of the car. In the hands of other directors such scenes would come off as trite and predictable, but Walsh gives them a freshness that lasts even after repeated viewings, and their psychological insight occasionally reveals more about Cody than a bookshelf of analysis. When seen for the first time, their impact is overwhelming.What do we do about Cody? Kill him, of course, which proves almost impossible. The police fear Jarrett is invincible (he even eludes them by going to prison) and they theorize he can only be destroyed from within. Thus undercover cop Hank Fallon becomes convict Vic Pardo and proceeds to undermine Cody and his gang. Betrayed, cornered, and shot, Cody still won't go down. ("What's holding him up?" asks Fallon.) In the end, only Cody can finish off Cody as Jarrett fires into the oil tanks and lights his own funeral pyre.The contrast between "High Sierra" and "White Heat" shows how far the world had moved in only eight years. In 1941, Bogart's Roy Earle falls to his death from a mountain top, virtually into the arms of Ida Lupino. In 1949, Cagney explodes in a nuclear-like fireball, with no one left to mourn his passing. Raoul Walsh directed both films, proving he could change with the times, but perhaps "White Heat" took something out of him. In a strange sense, Walsh's career was Cody Jarrett's final victim. He never reached such heights again, but then how could he?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>James Cagney is in top form as a psychopathic mama's boy in one of the best gangster films of the 1940's. Directed by Raoul Walsh of "High Sierra" fame the movie moves at a fast pace without a dull moment. All the elements are here for a superior crime drama including a train robbery, car chases, doublecross, a prison break and plenty of gun play. The cast is top notch with lovely Virginia Mayo the femme fatale, Margaret Wycherly the tough-as-nails Ma, Steve Cochran the conniving Big Ed and Edmond O'Brien the undercover cop. However it's Cagney who will knock-your-socks-off with his dynamite performance. A highlight of the film takes place in the prison mess hall and the grand finale is explosive (to say the least).

		<fullReview>This is Warner Bros. in top form with a genre they created and excelled in throughout the thirties and forties. Cagney returns to the genre here, playing a psychopathic killer with a mother fixation, prone to migraines, and as cold-blooded as they come. Edmund O'Brien plays the cop that goes undercover in Cagney's prison cell to win him over as a fellow hood, hoping Cagney will lead him to information that can blow a case and put Cagney away for life, not just the two years he's serving on a trumped up rap to cover his more egregious caper. Virginia Mayo as Cagney's lying slut of a wife is exceptionally good and Margaret Wycherly as his criminal Ma should have earned an Oscar nom for her supporting work here. The film did get an Oscar nom for Best Original Story but in addition to Wycherly's work, it deserved nods as well for its complex Screenplay, full of unexpected twists and turns, and the superlative dramatic and tense Score of Max Steiner. This is a winner from beginning to end and one of the best you'll ever see in this area. Seek it out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cagney at his best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Cagney was on a bad box-office run during the late forties when he chose this project to revive his fortunes. He reunited with Raoul Walsh, who had directed him in one of his best gangster films, "The Roaring Twenties". The project also marked his return to Warner Brothers, the studio where he had had his early success and had become an icon. The writers based the action on the story of Ma Barker, and distilled all the brothers into one intense, violent, mother-fixated psychopath. It is at times a crude public information film showing off the cops' latest technology. We see their well-orchestrated, discreet pursuit of Ma Jarrett through the streets of a California town using three alternating cars. They use spectograph scans and fingerprints to establish a link between Jarrett and the train job. Later Fallon improvises a radio which the cops use to track down the gang at the chemical plant.At the same time it is a dark exploration of violent psychosis and betrayal. It is a study of an insane, unpredictable, vindictive, cold-blooded killer. But the power of Cagney's personality makes him the magnetic center of the film. The audience roots for Jarrett and despises the anonymous, bland, and deceitful cops. Jarrett is a brilliant crook, who is defeated not by his psychic flaws, but by the actions of others. On the first raid fellow gang members use his real name, tune in a radio, and choose not to kill their badly wounded friend. His mother is spotted by the police while out buying strawberries for him. He is betrayed by Big Ed, Verna, and finally, by the only person he really trusted apart from his Ma, Fallon. As Jarrett, Cagney gives one of the great performances of cinema.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Top of the Gangster World</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the film that brought James Cagney back to the gangster film, the genre that made him a star. Cagney plays Cody Jarrett a robber and killer with the psychosis of both migrane headaches and a mother fixation that rivals Oedipus Rex. He is a totally repulsive character whom no viewer should feel sympathy for. Screenwriters Ivan Goff and Ben Roberts make this more than just a gangster tale. But it is Cagney who makes it works. He takes Jarrett way over the top and he is so successful you actually feel sorry for him. He has many great moments, including the finale when he makes it to the "top of the world" by blowing up a oil refinery.A stellar supporting cast including Virginia Mayo,(who never looked better), Steve Cochran, John Archer, and Edmond O'Brien(almost as good as Cagney as Judas)are great as is Director Raoul Walsh's frenetic pace. But the star of the show is Cagney, who personally hated the film, calling it a quick cheapie, but he needed the money and his career needed a jump start. He was right, a new generation of fans discovered him and his star would never fall again"White Heat" though was well received upon it's release and has become one of the greatest gangster films ever made. In the list of great James Cagney performances, this is near the top of that world.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of the best Cagney films of all time! As Cody Jarret he is at his peak. For all you people who were raised in the San Fernando Valley, note the begining of the movie, the filming was done in Chatsworth calif. When they pan the camera, you can see Stony Point and Santa Susanna pass road in the foreground. Also, where they stop the train is the santa susanna tunnel.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My brief review of the film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A well-paced, exciting crime drama, all the elements come together well in order to produce one of the most memorable and superbly crafted noir films of the 1940s here. Walsh pays careful attention to the use of lighting effects and sound effects, plus the music fits in well, but the film's best feature is the smart acting - James Cagney as the vicious charismatic crook, and Margaret Wycherly providing strong support as the main character's mother, who helps her son and endorses his work. There is a bit of a coldness and distance to the film though. This comes about from there being no characters with which one can easily place sympathy. Cagney is ruthless and villainous - not at all easy to like - yet the police detectives are even harder to like, as they are all presented as dull and rather lifeless. But this is not a large problem, and the film's swift pace should still be enough to keep one enticed. Interestingly, the film actually benefits from its ending being so well publicised, which creates a real sense of anticipation when watching, as one knows how it will end. That said, if you have not been exposed to the ending before, there is still enough in the execution for it to excite most viewers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Scary how bloody convincing Cagney is in this one, esp. the scene where he finds out Maw is gone.......You think Sean Penn hasn't seen it? Mystic River anyone? Has Nothing on Jimmy. And to think the man was about 49 when he starred in this. Completely sells the role, lives in it, not a false note anywheres.For me, the most telling bit was when he casually raises his hand and Virginia Mayo flinches--you Know she's seen That before. She was really good in this, it's nice to see her get some recognition for her work finally when she passed on this winter.There are a few clichs trotted out--prison films all kinda look alike after while from back then, and certainly the cops tracking of their movements was a little too easy. Still that was prob. seen as being a 'cutting edge' gimmick at the time, so why not? Pretty hard hitting realistic, very influential movie. As good as you have heard.***1/2 outta ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Grand movie that crowns a great epoch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"White Heat" is a grand work that crowns the great epoch of classical gangster movies. The legend-director Raoul Walsh handles a complex story and matter with powerful skills. The treatment of the whole movie is brilliant. Personally, the scenes I liked most are those in the jail, the clash between Cody and Big Ed in the dark house and, of course, the grand finale in the refinery, visually stunning and perfectly elaborated. Walsh even manages to describe a possibly cumbersome matter, namely the policemen's work and techniques, without a moment of bore. The frequent action scenes are tough, exciting and photographed with extreme care. The story is fast-paced and the many events are linked beautifully.The classical gangster movies are celebrated for their outstanding characters, and "White Heat" is second to none on this side. It is impossible to forget the crazy Cody Jarrett (James Cagney) with his morbid affection toward his mother (Margaret Wycherly), his natural inclination to brutal violence and, nonetheless, his intelligence, smartness and professionalism in crime. Ma' Jarrett, totally devoted to Cody, cruel cunning and cool- minded, with subtle and fine psychological touches is shown to be as evil as her son. Great performance by Virginia Mayo as Verna. Greedy, amoral, liar, natural-born-cheater, she is the perfect kitten-gangster-moll, always ready to make a good deal of herself (differently from Marie Windsor who in other movies was the perfect gutsy, cynical gangster moll). Big Ed and the other thugs of Cody's gang are minor but interesting characters.What about the policeman Fallon (Edmond O'Brien)? Well, he is not very nice, isn't it? After all, he is a spy that betrays Cody's true affection. We particularly dislike him when, at the end, he fires against the gangster who "Treated him as a kid brother" (to use Cody's words). So, do we root for the criminal against the policeman? No, since director Walsh is so good in creating suspense that we feel constantly concerned about Fallon's fate.Two more notes. First: we audience sit down in front of the screen thinking "OK, let's enjoy another Cagney's job". But after a short while we somehow forget that we are just seeing Cagney acting in a movie. We are totally caught by Cody, and he really scares the audience! That gives an idea of Cagney's powerful talent. Second: up to my knowledge "White Heat" is the first movie of an endless sequence where the police, in order to prevent a robbery, provokes damages one hundred times worse than the value of the loot. Isn't that funny?"White Heat" is a much recommended film, that fully deserves its high reputation.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>End of an Era with a Bang</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was Warner Brothers exit from Gangster Flicks and they went out with a bang. It is still regarded as an classic and that's what it is. Right from the opening scenes it creates an atmosphere of suspension and terror, when Cagneys gang takes on a train, killing 2 potential witnesses. And it sets a relentless mode between the gangsters as well, as the unlucky guy who got his face burned is left behind, with his friend being asked to kill him to release him from pain. It also introduces the very special relationship triangle between Cagney as Cody, his dominating mother (Margret Wicherly in perfection) and his wife, who is hardly more then a gangster moll picked up in a side street, also played to perfection by Virginia Mayo. And it is there where we see his unforeseeable head aches coming down at him. From there the chase is on between him and the police, who is always on his heels, but can only get to him, after he gives himself up for a minor crime, he didn't commit to seek asylum(!) in prison. Enter Edmond O'Brien as a well educated undercover going after him and building a relationship with him. Everything fine so far, but his 2nd in command tries to get on top, killing Cody's mother in trying so. What follows is the most horrible outburst ever to be seen on a B/W screen. And a escape from prison. From there on we go straight to the great finale top of the world. Fast Paced, energetic, violent, psychopathic. What do you want more ?</fullReview>

Cagney brings a vulnerability to this "tough" guy that is full of depth and shows incredible range. The final scenes take place in a chemical plant and the set and the photography during this part of the movie are amazing. It almost has a Sci-Fi feel to it. There is this really funny scene where the police cars using a sonar detecting device chase the criminals around the city. They have these silly looking silver circles rotating around and around on top of the squad cars. I suppose it may have looked high tech back in the day but it looks like a bad b Sci Fi movie trick now.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fierce thriller with Cagney at his best...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"White Heat" marked the return of Jimmy Cagney to gangster flicks. The original public enemy allegedly didn't like the work when it was first released. I think it is his best. I also consider it a closet-noir film with Virginia Mayo as a conniving femme fatale and its moody black and white photography.Cagney was the only actor alive who could get away with dialogue like, "We'll find out what's in the kitty," or "I was gonna go 50/50 with a copper!". He chews up every scene he's in (which is most) and pulls off an amazing sequence in the prison cafeteria where he gets one of those excess headaches. Ma gets it in the back and you can't do that to Cagney. This is just a fun film to watch.The ending is one of the most famous climaxes in film history and should not be missed. It may have been a nuclear world Cody got to the top of, but he did it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Made it Ma, top of the world!"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK, so here's a question - who killed Ma Jarrett? Big Ed (Steve Cochran) terrorizes Verna (Virginia Mayo) by stating that he'll tell Cody Jarrett (James Cagney) how she shot Ma in the back. But because Verna gets to Cody first, she tells him the same story, but with Big Ed the perpetrator. I believe most viewers of the film take it on faith that Verna did it, but I think the story leaves enough room to consider that it could have gone otherwise. In it's way, the movie creates the same kind of dichotomy as another of Cagney's famous gangster films, "Angels With Dirty Faces". Did Rocky Sullivan die a yellow rat or did he do it for Father Jerry? It can be endlessly debated, and depending on your point of view, either scenario is possible.That's one of the reasons this is such a great film. Certainly, it's one of Cagney's greatest performances, and he goes at it with gusto. The jail house mess scene when he learns Ma is dead is Cagney at his maniacal best, improvising as he goes leaving even director Raoul Walsh guessing where it's heading. One wonders if it's one of those headache attacks that Jarrett's suffered ever since his father died, or the actualization of a sentiment he later shares with inmate Pardo/Fallon (Edmond O'Brien) - "Maybe I AM nuts".Hey, wasn't Margaret Wycherly great as Ma Jarrett? Couldn't you just picture her in a Texas Death Match against Margaret Hamilton's Wicked Witch of the West from "The Wizard of Oz"? You believe it when she says of Big Ed - "Anytime I can't handle his kind, I'll know I'm getting old..." It's a testament to Cagney's portrayal that even as the film's protagonist, you don't identify with him enough to want to see him get away with it. He casually guns down a railroad engineer in an early scene because the man remembered and spoke Cody's name. Later he gives new meaning to the term 'ventilate' when he airs out the stuffy trunk that contains Parker, one of Big Ed's inside men at the penitentiary. By the time the film builds up to the explosive finale, you come to see that Verna was right - you can pump him full of lead and he'll still keep coming at you.Say, did anyone make a connection when the radio broadcast of the train robbery made reference to the 'High Sierra' tunnel? That's another film that comes to mind when considering the great ones of the 1930/40's gangster era, along with Edward G. Robinson's "Little Caesar" (1931) and Cagney's own earlier work, "Public Enemy" from the same year. Of them all, Cagney's Cody Jarrett is undeniably the most vicious and tortured villain of the lot.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As so many others have said, they just don't make them like this any more! "Reservoir Dogs", "L.A. Confidential", "The Usual Suspects", "Goodfellas" - great movies, but for me, all seem to pale in comparison to this powerhouse of a gangster film. The tone is set from the first scene and the movie just hurtles along to its incredible ending.For some reason, this film seems to be overlooked in comparison to others in the period, and it's possibly because it's done in a style that hearkens back to the 30's "crime doesn't pay" documentary style of crime movies rather than the then-contemporary film noir style. Overall, it's a real pastiche of elements that work. The screenplay is _ridiculously_ good - I've never heard of the scriptwriters aside from this. Incredible performances by Cagney, Wycherly, Mayo, and O'Brien. Taut, in-your-face direction by Walsh. The technology used by the cops to find Cody's gang is great and the prison scene at the table just kicks it. And then, finally, there's that ending...And what an ending it is! One of the greatest in the history of film, right at the top of the world with "Lost Horizon", "Wizard of Oz", "Castaway", "La Dolce Vita", "Brokeback Mountain", "Runaway Train", "Get Carter", and others. So, if you haven't seen this amazing piece of work, grab it soon. 10/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"White Heat" marked James Cagney's return to Warner Bros. after a seven year absence. During that time he tried to rid himself of his gangster image in films that would present him in a more favorable light. But he just couldn't turn down the Ivan Goff/ Ben Roberts script and the chance to again work with director Raoul Walsh. It is reported that Cagney who always wanted to male his characters a little different, told the writers when referring to his character, "Let's make him a little crazy".Cagney plays Cody Jarrett, a career gangster with a mother fixation. We start off with a train robbery in which Jarrett guns down the engineer and fireman. The gang retreats to a mountain hideout where we meet Jarrett's mother (Margaret Wycherly) and his sluttish "wife" Verna (Virginia Mayo) and his chief Hench man "Big Ed" Summers (Steve Cochran) who has ambitions of his own.Treasury Agents Evans (John Archer) and Trent (Ray Montgomery) try without success to capture the gang. Jarrett cleverly takes the rap for a lesser robbery and is sent to prison for two years. While in prison "Big Ed" tries to have Jarrett killed without success. Jarrett learns that his mother has been murdered and in one of the film's most memorable scenes, loses it in the prison mess hall.Evans meanwhile has brought in agent Hank Fallon (Edmond O'Brien) and assigns him the task of infiltrating the gang and gaining Jarrett's confidence. He goes to prison and later escapes with Jarrett. Jarrett goes to settles the score with "Big Ed". Verna tells him that "Big Ed' shot his mother in the back even though it was her that had done it. "Big Ed" gets his through a door much the way Paul Kelly got his in "The Roaring Twenties" (1939). Later Fallon learns that Jarrett and his fence "The Trader" (Fred Clarke) are planning a major heist of an oil refinery.Cagney is outstanding as the psychopath Jarrett. Many consider this to be his greatest gangster role if not his greatest film. It's hard to disagree. There are many memorable moments in the film. In addition to the prison mess hall scene there the scene where he "airs out" the trunk of the car where a rival gang member is imprisoned, the scene where he kicks over the chair on which Verna is standing, his fits of madness and of course the final scene atop the storage tank.Virginia Mayo is excellent as Verna, the "wife" with a past and wandering eye, Margaret Wycherly as Ma Jarrett stands out as does Steve Cochran as the over ambitious "Big Ed". Edmond O'Brien is not very convincing as a supposed hard nosed convict.A true classic.</fullReview>

Cagney is brilliant as the psychopathic Cody Jarret, he a scene-chewing, bad-ass, whacko. This film really allows Cagney to catapult himself to new levels of insanity and really demonstrate his range as an actor (I am sure that DeNiro must have taken a cue from him for Taxi Driver).And the final scene, with Cagney atop the burning fuel tank screaming 'top o'the world to ya', ma'!" is breathtaking rather than cheezey. Cagney is so dead on in this movie that true fans of the genre cannot take their eyes off of him. I also found it appropriate that imdb listed Reservoir Dogs as a suggested film on the White Heat front page. If you are a fan of this film, then you really must see White Heat in all its glory (and vice versa).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Raoul Walsh was a director who excelled in films that involved tough guys doing what tough guys did. In "White Heat", perhaps one of the best films of his long career, he shows us a group of desperate men who covered an era in American history when these gangsters created terror in the land."White Heat" was perhaps one of the best movies of this genre, and it shows. The film involves us for two hours following Cody Jarrett and his gang as they roam the country. Cody is a different type of wise guy, he is a man who cares deeply about his mother, as she seems to follow him everywhere abetting his criminal activity. Jarrett is in love with the gorgeous Verva, a woman who seems to be with Cody for whatever she can get out of him.Cody Jarrett was one of the best characters James Cagney played on screen. He had a good understanding of what made this bandit tick and he is always amazing throughout the movie. Edmund O'Brien has an excellent opportunity to shine as the police informer that infiltrates Cody's gang. Virginia Mayo, a gorgeous woman, adds a touch of sensuality to her Verva. Margaret Wycherly is perfect as the mother who stand by her son.The black and white cinematography by Sid Hickox is wonderful, especially the apocalyptic finale at the refinery. Max Steiner's music is always effective and adds a dimension to the film.This film will not disappoint for the great job Raoul Walsh extracted from his crew, especially out of Mr. Cagney.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>White Heat was something of a comeback for James Cagney. Curiously enough ever since his Oscar winning portrayal of George M. Cohan in Yankee Doodle Dandy, Cagney's films had either not been all that great or were getting critical kudos, but no box office. By reinventing himself in the gangster genre, Cagney bounced back to the top of film stardom.Cody Jarrett is definitely the gangster redefined for Cagney. It's light years different from Tom Powers in Public Enemy. In those early Warner Brothers features, Cagney is a slum kid who's rising to the top through fists and brains, but he's not psychotic. Cody Jarrett gives us a whole new Cagney, a ruthless, incredibly shrewd head of a criminal gang with insanity galloping through his family. The insanity comes from his father, the brains from his mother. Margaret Wycherly got her career role in White Heat as Ma Jarrett. Obviously modeled on Ma Barker, she's one tough woman. And street smart. One of my favorite scenes is how she shakes the treasury tail that was put on her. It's only dumb luck that John Bryant, the agent in charge finds the motel that Wycherly, Cagney, and Virginia Mayo are staying.This was also a return to the slatternly roles for Virginia Mayo. She first was noticed in Samuel Goldwyn's The Best Years of Our Lives as Dana Andrews's trampy wife. After that she was playing good girls in lightweight stuff. Back as Cody's two timing wife, she gets the best role of her career as well. As FBI informer, Edmond O'Brien has the unenviable job of getting close to Jarrett. The plot of the film has Cagney turning himself in on a minor robbery charge to avoid being tagged for the robbery at the beginning of the film of a U.S. mail train where four people are killed. The feds don't believe it so O'Brien who apparently specializes in going into prison to mix among the cons and gain information, gets the job of going undercover in Joliet prison in Illinois to get close to Cagney. He succeeds, but the plans take a different and sudden turn which you will have to see the film for.Even in today's world which certainly has more explicit cinema violence than back in 1949. White Heat is not for the squeamish. But you will feel the tension every minute. And that climax.........Well didn't he make it to the top of the gangster world. Ma was probably very proud.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrific.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A terrific crime flick with a great performance by James Cagney, even if over-acting is lurking in almost every corner. The same thing goes for the soundtrack by Max Steiner; most of the time it's great and exhilarating, but at some moments it's simply a little too much. These minor points hardly bothered me, though. The story - which is on the one hand a little too convenient at times but also pretty creative at other moments - is fast-paced and the movie is over before you know it.The other supporting roles are pretty good, too, but the beauty and presence of Virginia Mayo is really something else. Margaret Wycherly is also great as the dominant mother; she and this film mst have been some inspiration for Alfred Hitchcock's 'Psycho' (check some shots of the buildings in the beginning and that part of the line when they chase her, "dead ahead", it just keeps ringing), though I have no proof.The direction is quite good, with some wonderful cinematography here and there (the finale, for instance). As far as I'm aware, this is only the second Raoul Walsh film that I've seen ('High Sierra' is the other one, which is maybe even better), and so far he's turned out to be a terrific storyteller.9 out of 10.P.s.: was Cagney's voice an inspiration for the duck voice in Lucio Fulci's 'Lo squartatore di New York'? Sure sounded like it at times.</fullReview>

TITANIC catch-phrase (which his character anachronistically steals 37 years too soon). James Cagney's "Cody Jarrett" keeps lamenting, "All I ever had was Ma," like a Helen Reddy tune on a skipping vinyl record. As always, Hollywood portrays American law enforcement as "Keystone Kops," here, playing around with ludicrously slow "tracking oscillators" (which take hours to do what a basic G.P.S. unit can accomplish instantaneously). As a result, the entire gasoline supply for the West Coast becomes collateral damage sacrificed to police ineptitude, no doubt resulting in scores of immediate civilian deaths, and hundreds--if not thousands--of cancer victims croaking days or decades down the road in one of the worst U.S. environmental catastrophes ever. Cagney's "Cody" has no luxuries apart from (most likely stolen) fast cars and his gun arsenal. Yet this self-proclaimed nut case is far more efficient and effective as a leader of men than anyone working for the government. He has the last laugh.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Excellent,Thrilling And Explosive Gangster/Film-Noir Classic With A Brilliant,Unforgettable Performance From James Cagney.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>White Heat is an excellent and thrilling Gangster Film-Noir classic that is filled with great direction,amazing performances from James Cagney and a great cast,a wonderful script and a terrific score. All of those elements make White Heat a cinema classic and James Cagney at his best.White Heat tells the story of Cody Jarrett(James Cagney),a psychotic criminal who is the leader of a gang of thieves and robbers while being watched by his loyal Mother Ma Jarrett(Margaret Wycherly)and married to his spiteful wife Verna(Virginia Mayo). Later,Cody's caught and put in prison,but vows to escape and pull off a big score but things start to go wrong for Cody who wants one last attempt to be on top of the world.Released in 1949,White Heat is a brilliant and powerful classic that marked James Cagney's return to the Gangster genre ten years after The Roaring Twenties in 1939. White Heat would also be Cagney's last Gangster film and is an amazing and proper send-off Cagney with one of the greatest Gangster films of all-time. From beginning to end White Heat is a terrific and powerhouse Crime Drama that knocks you back to the wall with intense thrills and explosive energy that never stops until the very end giving us a movie that is a Gangster movie,Film Noir,Heist film and Prison movie all in one entertaining viewers for 113 minutes at a break neck pace. One of the reasons White Heat is a great film that not only bridges the gap but combines the great genres of Gangster Movie and Film-Noir mixing together the trademarks of the 1930s Gangster films with the atmosphere and style of the Film-Noirs of the 1940s making the tone of White Heat darker,cynical and more brooding than Cagney's previous Crime Dramas mainly because of the violence,use of Black and White photography,characters attitudes and the gritty style. The style and feel of White Heat gave birth to a new kind of Crime Drama that paved the way for other classic Crime Dramas such as Stanley Kubrick's The Killing(1956)and John Huston's The Asphalt Jungle(1950). So in many ways White Heat can be seen as the end of another era(1930s Crime Dramas)and the beginning of another(1940-50s Crime Dramas). The film's main character Cody Jarrett is easily one of the most fascinating and unforgettable characters in movie history because when we see Cody we are scared of him but in some ways we still feel kind of sorry for him. Throughout the movie we are terrified of Jarrett because he is like a bomb ready to explode and is so unpredictable and intense we don't know what he's going to do next whether he's dealing with the cops or members of his own crew because if you cross Cody the wrong way you will die in a violent way. While Cody isn't a Gangster in the traditional sense of the word Cody has some of the traits that are very much in the Gangster genre. We feel sympathy for Cody because of his relationship with his Mother and that Cody and his Mother care for one another and will protect each other at all costs(although I don't think anyone would dare call Cody a Mama's boy). We also see that Cody has severe mental problems that are very disturbing(watch the now famous prison lunch scene and you will see)and as the film goes on you see that he starts to become more crazier and unhinged and his mental state of mind catches up with him. Cody Jarrett is an amazing and truly powerful character you will never forget after watching the film. The screenplay by Ivan Goff and Ben Roberts(from the story by Virginia Kellogg)is great and filled with dialog and moments that are tough,hard boiled and match the spirit of the movie. The ending of White Heat is one of the greatest,most famous and iconic endings in movie history and has a great line that has been referenced in other films. The ending is one of the reasons if not the main reason this film is a classic. An amazing and unforgettable conclusion.The cast is wonderful James Cagney is is excellent,unforgettable and at his best as Cody Jarrett,with Cagney being menacing,tough and believable. Powerful performance from Cagney. Virginia Mayo is terrific and sexy as Verna,Cody's disloyal wife. Edmond O'Brian is wonderful as Hank Fallon/Vic Pardo,an undercover cop in Cody's crew. Margaret Wycherly is riveting as Ma Jarrett,Cody's Mother. Steve Cochran is outstanding as Big Ed,Cody's backstabbing right hand man. John Archer is amazing as Phillip Evans,a Cop that is after Cody.The direction by Raoul Walsh is amazing and stylish,with Walsh using dark and harsh lighting while moving the camera keeping the film moving at a great pace. Fantastic direction,Walsh.The score by Max Steiner is brilliant,powerful and intense and adds to the film. Great score,Steiner.In final word,if you love James Cagney,Crime Dramas,Gangster Films,Film-Noir or films in general,I highly suggest you see White Heat,an excellent and unforgettable Gangster/Film-Noir classic that you can watch again and again. Highly Recommended. 10/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Raoul Walsh directed this all-time classic gangster picture that stars Jimmy Cagney as crazed criminal Cody Jarrett, who is the leader of his gang of thieves, and devoted to his loving Ma(played by Margaret Wycherley) much to the frustration of his beautiful wife Verna(played by Virginia Mayo). In order to take the heat off a major heist, Cody surrenders to the police on a lesser charge for a lesser sentence, though still retaining control. Enter an undercover policeman(played by Edmond O'Brian) who befriends Cody in jail and helps him escape when subordinate Big Ed(played by Steve Cochran) kills his beloved Ma, forcing him to avenge her death. After he does so, Cody leads them on a big heist of a chemical plant payroll, but O'Brian is uncovered, leading to that explosive "Top of the world" finale... Brilliant film hasn't aged a bit, one of the few films of its era to look and feel contemporary. Cagney is outstanding as Cody, one of cinemas most memorable villains. Direction is exemplary, and story engrossing and still timely; the explosive climax is justly legendary, and will take your breath away! Much respected film was shamefully ignored that year for Academy Awards, but has stood the test of time. Not to be missed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"White Heat" is a wonderful example of the classic days of the Warner Bros. gangster films, which are exceptional to me because of the way they engage the audience to root both for AND against the criminal protagonist.James Cagney elevates an already-great script playing the mother-obsessed Cody Jarrett, and even though director Raoul Walsh exposes the violent monster that he was, it's impossible not to want to see Cody get revenge on his double-crossing wife and former partner Big Ed. Cagney here displays the gleeful amorality that Hollywood has been forever trying to re-capture on film, either failing by over-moralizing or over-glorifying criminals and their lifestyles. Martin Scorsese's "Goodfellas" may be one of the few films made after the glory days of the gangster picture to strike a realistic balance between violence and its aftermath.Okay, some of Cagney's acting is big- his reaction in prison to his mother's death may cross the line into scenery-chewing- but you must admit the man makes it work. "White Heat" is a violent, vital, and eternally-watchable film from the great gangster days of Hollywood. A classic.GRADE: A</fullReview>

Cagney brings to life one of the most evil characters to ever be portrayed on film. I get chills every time I see him go nuts in the prison cafeteria. And when he shoots into that trunk "I'll give you a little air ..." while calmly munching a chicken leg ... we've all seen tons of cold blooded killers on film but this guy must have been born at the south pole. This is just a great movie with a great story and wonderful characters. Everyone plays off Cagney and he makes them all shine in return. A classic masterpiece of film noir.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As he practically invented the gangster genre with "The Public Enemy", "Angels with Dirty Faces", and "The Roaring Twenties", it was only right for James Cagney to reunite with director Raoul Walsh for "White Heat", the last great gangster film of the 30's and 40's. Cagney plays Cody Jarrett, a sadistic hood with a fixation for his mother (Margaret Wycherley). In jail, Cody befriends another inmate (Edmond O'Brien) who, unbeknownst to Cody, is actually an undercover cop with the job of infiltrating the Jarrett gang and discovering where Cody hid loot from a train robbery. After breaking out of jail, Cody kills Big Ed, a gang member who has killed Cody's mother and run off with Cody's girl (Virginia Mayo). With the gang back together, Cody prepares for a big score, unaware that the police are right on his heels. As with so many gangster flicks, "White Heat" relies on the appeal of the genre, along with the strong performance from its leading man. Cagney is terrific as always, and the supporting cast does a great job as well. The ending, when Cody delivers his famous "Made it, Ma. Top of the World" before being blown to bits, is quite famous. As a whole, "White Heat" is about as good a way as any to close out one of the great genres of cinema as any. You'll feel on top of the world after you watch this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You cannot fault this film. Anyone who watches it remembers it for all the right reasons. The acting by all the lead characters is superb, but James Cagney manages to outshine them all. He has created a character that you will never forget and manages to project an evil person that does have some humanity. What this film does is something many modern films cannot do, possibly only the Godfather parts one and two were better gangster films. But this film is better than the modern films that seem to rely on extreme violence, bad language and sex ( i.e Tarrantino or Scorsese ) Raoul Walsh does a superb job but it is all about Cagney and the way he brings this larger than life character to the screen. Today's actors could learn a lot from watching James Cagney's portrayal of Cody Jarrett! And of course this film has one of the best endings to a film ever!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After a break of ten years James Cagney returns to the role of psychotic gangster, and what a return it is. The excitement starts as soon as the film begins with Cody Jarrett and his gang holding up a mail train and stealing $400,000. When one of the gang calls Cody by his name he guns down the locomotive's driver and fireman so they can't tell the police who did it. The gang get restless as they wait for things too cool down but eventually they leave their hideout using a storm for cover.They head for Los Angeles but the law catches up with them when Cody's mother is spotted while out shopping, once again they manage to escape but he realises the only way he can escape the death penalty is if he has a perfect alibi, to establish this he confesses to a lesser crime that took place hundreds of miles away in Illinois on the same day as the train robbery. The police see through his plan and put an undercover officer, Hank Fallon, in the same cell hoping to gain Cody's trust. After Fallon saves Cody's life he gains his trust and plans a break out but thinks don't go according to plan when Cody is hospitalised after he hears of his mother's death and has a break down.This is only a set back as Cody gets his hands on a gun and breaks out taking his gang with him. Once out he heads back to California with the intention of getting revenge on Big Ed, the man who has stolen his wife and tried to have him killed in Prison. When he gets there he catches his wife trying to escape and she tells him that Big Ed had shot his mother in the back and that she will help Cody get his revenge. Once this is done Cody and his gang plan their next job; a job that will lead to a famously explosive ending featuring one of the most famous lines in cinema history.James Cagney is fantastic in the role of Cody Jarrett, Virginia Mayo does a good job as Cody's treacherous wife who will betray whoever she needs on order to get what she wants and Edmond O'Brien is impressive as the undercover agent. Even though this film was made during the days of the Hays Code is is gripping and has a fair bit of cold blooded violence... enough that is still has a 15 certificate, fairly rare for a film of that era. If you enjoy classic cinema this film is a must see, featuring a great actor in one of his greatest roles.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The era of the classic Warner's gangster flicks had long since passed when 'White Heat' came out in 1949. It must have seemed 'retro' decades before that term came into vogue. But Raoul Walsh and James Cagney revived the genre with a vengeance. 'White Heat' absolutely crackles with tension and violence, as Cagney portrays Cody Jarrett, a murdering crime boss who is tough, smart, and flat-out crazy. He is devoted to his equally-crooked mother and suffers violent seizures from time to time. The members of his mob, including his beautiful wife Verna (Virginia Mayo), are all deathly afraid of him, and with good reason. After a successful train robbery nets the gang a lot of cash, Jarrett turns himself in to the cops on a lesser charge, one that establishes an alibi for the train job and ensures he'll get out of prison after a much shorter term. A U.S. Treasury agent, Phillip Evans (John Archer) sees through the scheme and assigns Hank Fallon (Edmund O'Brien) to go undercover in the prison where Jarrett serves time with instructions to earn Jarrett's confidence and find out where the stolen money is. Much of the tension in 'White Heat' derives from Fallon's precarious situation, with the audience never knowing if or when his true identity will be discovered by Jarrett. There are a number of close calls, but the wily undercover agent manages to explain or talk his way out of trouble every time, till near the very end. O'Brien is good in the role, but it is Cagney's explosive performance that propels 'White Heat' along like a runaway train. Cody Jarrett can be charismatic and amusing at times, but those around him are aware that there's no telling when that volcanic temper will erupt again, or who it might be directed at. His wife Verna lives in almost constant fear of him, dreaming of an escape, even taking up with 'Big Ed', Jarrett's number two (Steve Cochran) while Jarrett is in prison. She too manages to talk herself out of a certain death sentence by blaming Ed for killing Jarrett's mother, when in fact she did it herself. (You don't want to be the person Jarrett thinks killed his mother.) After escaping from prison, Jarrett reunites with his gang; they plan and execute a payroll heist at a big chemical plant in Long Beach. Fallon is now trusted by Jarrett but fears for his life as well. He manages to tip off the authorities about the robbery, and the climax of the film is a shoot-out at the plant, ending finally with Cody Jarrett atop a huge gas storage tank, firing his own pistol into it and literally going up in flames as he yells, "Made it, Ma! Top of the world!"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cagney at the top of his game, let alone 'world'!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Famous for that scene, that's really the top to his career. White Heat centres again on Cagney being the villain, starting with what may seem with an out-moded robbery of a train as if in the 'Wild West'. (Hey, I'm British and we had 'The Great Train Robbery' of 1963!). The vicious little man, Cody Jarret (Cagney) and his crooks take the train. There's the obligatory 'Big Ed' guy who wants to take Jarret on from within, especially as he's making a move on Jarret's moll, Virna played by Virginia Mayo. There's a nice scene where Jarret kicks her off a chair after Virna berates him about his mollycoddling mother being absent. "She's gotta get the strawberries for 'her boy'!"Jarret's finally in jail, the police decide to keep tags on him by putting a stooge in his cell with him, to work his way into Jarret's confidence to break his gang and his next big job (A wages heist at a refinery). Vic Pardo (O'Brien) excellently plays the cop but named 'Fallon' in jail, who manages finally to get into Jarret's gang, for Jarret breaks out for the heist enabling 'Fallon' to keep tabs on him further. In the meantime, his devoted Ma (Every gangster boy has one!) is killed because of the treachery between Big Ed and Virna. Obviously he goes ape, and an attempt is made on his life from within the prison by Big Ed on the outside who obviously has help 'inside'. He manages to get revenge on the guy who set him up for that, when on the breakout, the guy is in the boot/trunk of the car. "Wassa matter, need some air?" And he shoots a load of bullets into the boot/trunk in true Cagney-Gangster style!Jarret sneaks up on Virna and Big Ed, and despatches the latter, where Virna just about makes Jarret believe it was Big Ed's doing in his ma's death and nothing to do with her in slimy fashion. Although hiding her feelings nervously from the demise of Big Ed, and waiting for Jarret's reaction she's reprieved when Jarret holds out his arm for her to latch on to !Unfortunately for Pardo/Fallon, one of the gang members knows his face, Pardo manages to turn the gun on Jarret in the refinery station where the wages heist is and holds them up. "I fell for it - he's a copper," says Jarret, "and his name's FALLON!". He goes on to say he's going to get it sooner than he thinks as one of Jarret's minions sneaks up on Pardo.The gang though are dispersed, Pardo manages to get free and get to the police lines. Virna again, slimily smarms up to the cops for a deal if she can talk Jarret down. "No deal!" says the top cop, coldly! It's the end for Jarret and his gang, and as so many of us know the final scene is in sight. Pardo's the one who's befriended Jarret in jail, almost like a real pal, but we're reminded he's a trusty cop, as he's shooting at Jarret with a rifle when he's mounted an oil or gas tank . "What's holding HIM up!" That's when the fateful line is delivered and ...when Jarret shoots wildly atop the flammable tank (Well, it wouldn't be a cuddly toy factory, would it!?) BOOOOMMMMMMMM!!! A true explosive ending to an excellent piece of movie-making. Cagney made this film in 1949, when most would expect the 'gangster-genre' was waning - but he proved otherwise with this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>James Cagney (Cody) heads a group of gangsters. He's a psychopath who loves his mother, Margaret Wycherly (Ma). Virgina Mayo (Verna) is his wife but she definitely plays second fiddle to Wycherly when it comes to who Cagney respects more. Steve Cochran (Big Ed) is Cagney's number 2 who decides to take matters into his own hands when Cagney is sent to prison for a couple of years. Taking matters into his own hands means taking on Cagney's leadership??uh oh?.not a good move. John Archer (Evans) plans to bring Cagney down with the help of inside man Edmond O'Brien (Fallon). Can they succeed? Wow! Great film. At just under 2 hours the film still manages to move swiftly as we progress through several episodes that all lead us to a memorable explosive ending with those famous last words ? "Made it ma! Top of the world!" The dialogue is excellent in this film as is the acting. A mention must be made to Margaret Wycherly. She is very good as a gangster mother and her acting is a million miles from the sanctimonious nonsense that was her effort in the vastly over-rated Gary Cooper film "Sergeant Yawn" (1941).An added interest throughout the film is learning the police procedures of the time, eg, following a suspect using the "car A, car B, car C" strategy. Don't think that'll work on Ma Wycherly, though. However, the oscillator (radio technology) is the device that may just bag things for the good guys.My wife's summary of the film was "?.a boys film. And it's too long". Yep, it's a boy's film, I guess, and it's excellent entertainment. So, time to plan my next heist??.however, I won't re-kindle my mother fixation as I think we should move on in life.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A classic midnight movie - no matter how many times I've seen it by now this is still a beautiful film, full of violence and humour with an earthy romance and some dodgy Oedipus psychologies maybe, but beautiful to watch. It was Cagney and Warner Brothers goodbye to the gangster film genre that had helped make both famous in the '30's, a homage updated for the more world-weary post WW2 generation. And imho it was better than High Sierra too, although both were simple and super stories.Cody Jarrett crackpot leader of heist gang decides to do two years for a job he didn't do instead of taking the more serious penalty for the train job he did do which left four dead. Or five if you include the guy with the steamed eyebrows. Cop Vic Pardo is installed in prison to worm his way into Jarrett's confidence to try to discover who his Big Fence is before Jarrett goes off the rails. There's lots to savour in here: Cody and his Ma's cosy relationship, Verna and Big Ed's not-so-cosy relationship, in fact everyone is rather cold and cynical to everyone else. You can almost feel sorry for the mass-murdering hoodlum Cagney plays because he was the only person in the picture to let his guard down, and to his ultimate cost. He incredulously asked her spirit what she thought of it but I bet Ma didn't like that. The continuity mistakes when it turned dark in a twinkling at the gas plant still annoy a little, but no film ever made is free from fault. The ending is so memorable you can forgive any goof anyway.They tell me over and over again that films are made so much better nowadays in every department ? so why is this film still so important and unforgettable? Is it that excess sex, violence and cgi cartoonery without a story lead to an even more superficial and forgettable product? If you're going to watch this for the first time there's probably millions of us out here who would envy you!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Raoul Walsh filmed one of his most interesting films, perhaps the best. In this film James Cagney worked ten years after having played Walsh orders in "The Roaring Twenties" (1939), here shows the face inhuman and ruthless gangster "Cody Jarrett" which may be the most memorable character of the career of this great actor from New York.As "Tony Camonte" that Intrerpret Paul Muni in "Scarface" (1931) by Howard Hawks and he uttered the phrase "The World is Yours", the fugitive and bloody Jarrett wants to reach the top of the world. But while the character of Scarface set in the Great Depression, "Jarrett" America lives in a prosperous, industrialized revived; assaults trains, police payroll and steals (first detailed in the film) gives chase through advanced technology time (a follower of radio waves).The most notable are the scenes that collects hysterics "Cody" in the dining room of the jail, the flight of the band in car under heavy storm and the final sequence. This classic is an impressive statement on violence in cinema. It was filmed at the end of a decade where black cinema began a new phase, with directors like John Huston, Samuel Fuller and Stanley Kunrick to give a new vision of the genre, which had begun with Raoul Walsh in this splendid masterpiece .</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Cagney is sizzling as the white-hot, vicious Cody Jarrett in Raoul Walsh's 'White Heat'.This perhaps Cagney's best gangster role, although it's a close race between his Tom Powers of 'The Public Enemy' (1931) and Rocky Sullivan of 'Angels With Dirty Faces' (1949). Cagney is older here, and Cody is portrayed very differently from 30's gangsters. He is just as psychotic and menacing, but he definitely has a weak side, with his sudden headaches and his mother-fixation. The trend towards psychoanalysis and Freudian interpretations post-WW2 is apparent in Cagney's character. Cagney's acting is brilliant in this one, spitting out the snappy dialogue with perfect ease. That said, Cagney never seems to be acting in this one, he is truly 'being' Cody.Raoul Walsh's gritty direction is a major factor in the film's success. The film never slows in action, and Walsh handles every sequence with a masterful touch. The supporting cast is terrific too- of particular note is Virginia Mayo as Cagney's gangster-moll wife. The sexual tension, hate and disgust is electric between the pair.A heated finale, smoking Cagney performance and the magic of Walsh's touch combine to make this one of the best of the Warner Bros. gangster films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This role is so made for Jimmy Cagney, he was born to play this part as Cody Jarrett. He is the ultimate villain of golden cinema and what makes a brilliant movie is a brilliant villain. It's one of these films that goes down as classics, no one will never forget this movie.Jimmy Cagney plays Cody Jarrett, a nuttier who is a crime boss mastermind of a gang. Jarrett and his mates Zuckie Hommell (Ford Rainey), Het Kohler (Mickey Knox) and Giovanni Cotton Valetti (Wally Cassell)robs a train at the beginning of the film where the train engineer says to Jarrett "You won't get away with it, Cody" and Jarrett responds "you got a good memory for names, too good" and shoots him. This wasn't the only great scene in the movie. The most memorable scene in the movie is probably in the prison when one of the inmates tell Cody that his mothers dead, because Cody's mum was the only greatest person in this life he goes insane and starts punching prison guards, outstanding.Jimmy Cagney to me stood out more than the rest of the stars in the 30s and 40s when he sticks to rolls like this. "Public Enemy", "Roaring Twenties" and "Angels with Dirty Faces" are also Cagney's greats but White Heat showed Cagney's true character and actor's today like Michael Madsen, Robert De Niro and Al Pacino are truly inspired by Cagney in this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As Spare as They Get</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first word that jumps to mind in describing "White Heat" is: spare. The whole production has a taut, tense quality; every scene, look and gesture conveys something of importance. It's a very good, very effective gangster movie, and not quite like anything that had come before it, but it falls just short of greatness for me.James Cagney is lavished with praise for his performance, but am I the only one who thought he was ever so slightly hammy? His raving lunatic scenes aren't always convincing, and his tough-guy patter at times sounds more silly than sinister.Virginia Mayo is pretty good, though she's relegated to a subordinate position--she fills the leggy blonde dame quota but does little else. Still, her performance adds a lot, and I love the scene where she has to spit out her gum before kissing Cagney. Do you think that was planned?---it has the feel of an improvised moment.The one who registers most is the one with probably the smallest role: Margaret Wycherley as dear ol' Ma. She's really sensational in her few scenes, and she adds gravity to the movie that is otherwise lacking. The look in her eyes when she's trying to lose the detectives trailing her is unforgettable."White Heat" is a quick and dirty film, a lot of fun, but not one that left me with the feeling of needing to revisit it.

		<shortDescription>One of the best films of the 40s</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love movies of all genres, old and new. White Heat is a masterpiece, and is yet another favourite of a long line of classics from this marvellous decade(think the likes of It's a Wonderful Life, Casablanca, Double Indemnity and Rebecca among this line too).White Heat has a compelling story, with great drama and the more psychological moments are even more impressive. White Heat is a very well made and directed movie too, with cinematography that is both beautiful and atmospheric and meticulous production values.The music is superb and the dialogue is endlessly quotable. In regards to the acting, James Cagney is superb in perhaps his best performance, and he is marvellously supported by an electrifying Virginia Mayo, an appropriately slimy Edmund O'Brien and a sinister Margaret Wycherly.Overall, one of the best of the genre, of its decade and perhaps even ever. 10/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"White Heat" is another crime film starred by James Cagney, who is here even more malignant than the roles he played in "The Public Enemy" and "Angels with Dirty Faces". In the aforementioned films Cagney's roles although also as villains have some feeling of goodness, but Arthur 'Cody' Jarrett (Cagney) is implacable with all around except with his mother. Without any mercy he killed and even he enjoyed doing it. An already old Cagney was as brilliant as in other crime films. Edmond O' Brien also played well the role of a covered police agent, in fact he was the positive hero of the film, while Virginia Mayo played in acceptable way the role of the unfaithful Jarrett's wife. The rest of the cast did also well, Steve Cochran always good as a man without any ethic, and Margaret Wycherly as Jarrett's mother. Final scenes of the film are all interesting and impressive, where Jarrett (Cagney) showed all his psychopathic character, enjoying doing bad to everyone even when it is close to die. If one compares the acting of Cagney in this film, only Joe Pesci resembles him a bit in the crime film "Goodfellas". Cagney together with Bogart and E.G. Robinson were, in my modest opinion, the best actors in crime films of the last century.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>James Cagney and Virginia Mayo at Their Best!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I agree with all of the praise showered on James Cagney, who was one of the mega-stars of all time, but I must also praise Virginia Mayo, known mainly as the "most beautiful blond in films," for the fabulous job she did in "White Heat." You'll notice that most of the reviewers here practically ignored Miss Mayo, but that has been the case for her entire career. After her incredible turn as the cheating wife of Dana Andrews in "The Best Years of Our Lives" and being ignored by the Academy for a best supporting actress nod, she was again snubbed in this fine film.Mayo has said, "I was a better actress than they ever gave me credit. It was always about how I looked." No doubt, she was gorgeous, like Arlene Dahl and Hedy LaMarr, but she could also act.Today, if Catherine Zeta-Jones gave the SAME performance as Mayo, she'd get an Oscar nomination. But, as Virginia herself said in an interview about Oscars, "there was much more competition back then...today they give Oscars for just ordinary performances..." She's right. Every year, I'm shocked at the winner's circle."White Heat" was certainly one of James Cagney's last great performances along with "Love Me or Leave Me" with Doris Day, for which he received a Best Actor nomination. Why wasn't he cited for "White Heat?" He's amazing to watch, for he doesn't seem to be acting, just living the life.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is Cagney at his ultimate very best. The acting is good for a generation ago. Cagney is more believable, from say Humphrey Bogart because I have never in any of his movies seen him less than the tough guy, with no cracks. Bogart had a tender side. This is just one great movie which leaves no doubt in my mind why Cagney was a great actor. He is one person who could play almost the same part in most of his movies and continue to pull it off.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cagney's On Top 'O' the World</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is without a doubt the most taut, well-directed, gritty, and thoroughly intense James Cagney movie ever, if not the apex of the film noir genre itself. I had rented this last week because I'd heard of it many times, but had never seen it. And the other night at 3:00 a.m., when I found that I couldn't sleep, I popped in this film to pass the time. Needless to say, I never did get to sleep that night. I was absolutely blown away, thunderstruck at this expertly-crafted tour de force. The screen sizzled with intensity and I quivered with unbridled excitement while I watched James Cagney's electric performance. I've been a great admirer if his work for years, and this film has cemented my fanaticism. He's unquestionably at the top of his game here. Best of all, the action in this film NEVER STOPS! It's a roller-coaster ride of unforgettable scenes, thrilling plot twists, and sharp, scathing dialogue from the time the film begins and the final rolling of the credits. The best actor of all times, in the best film of all times. Who could ask for more?!?!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is Cagney's best movie. It is better than any other gangster film he did. It is superior to Public Enemy, Roaring Twenties and Angels With Dirty Faces. It truly is a great movie with great action and great acting. I find this movie very enjoyable. In the movie there are many memorable lines. One that I always remember besides Cagney's last line at the end of the film is, "Big Ed, Great...Big... Ed. Know why they call him that? Because his ideas are big. Someday he's gonna get a really big one, about me. It'll be his last." Great acting by Jimmy Cagney. One thing that I didn't like about White Heat was how Cagney was the hero and not such a bad guy and they still tried to make him look like the villain by adding in the undercover cop, Hank Fallon, played by Edmund O'Brien. Anyone that Cody really killed asked for it. In the end they try to make the gangster look bad and they try to make the cop look like the hero. Another thing I didn't like was how Cody never finds out it was Verna that killed his mother and not Big Ed. She gets carted off to jail in the end, but never pays for the murder of an innocent old woman. Anyway it's not a big deal. This movie has nothing in it to make you doubt its greatness. See this movie. You definitely will not be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was simply the best gangster movie ever made. Cagney managed to outdo his performance in "Angels with Dirty Faces". If you remember,in that movie the final scene took place at the electric chair in prison. Cagney, brave 'til the end, was asked by his childhood friend (a priest) not to act so brave, because the kids back in the 'hood would look up to him as a hero. So Cagney obliges and screams for mercy at the end -a classic finish that no one at that time thought could ever be topped. But Cagney managed to a decade later in "White Heat" with the famous "On top of the world, Ma!" finish. In the end, Cagney was corned by the coppers in an oil refinery. They told him to give up and turn himself in. But Cagney refused-tough guy to the end. Rather than turn himself in, he not only blew himself up, but the entire oil refinery! The ending was rather symbolic-that was his last gangster film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There is around 60 people credited with being on screen in White Heat, but very few people seem to have noticed that - and who can blame them? This is the James Cagney Show and no one is going to forget it. Whether he liked it or not, this was the kind of stuff he did best.(What he called the "dese, dem's and do's" movies.) You could easily start knocking this film for being nothing new: In the can, the break out, the big score, the stool pigeon, the fast woman (to be fought over), the cop with the megaphone, the big climax. It wasn't new at the time and it is certainly nothing new now.Cagney could double talk and do black humour better than most, but he had his limits. Warner Brothers knew what he could do and what he couldn't and his efforts to break out of these WB limitations (by starting his own production company) failed. His own productions mostly go unseen today - although some have their merits.Codey (Cagney) gets away with a lot in this film that the modern director would think twice about or present in a different way. The cold blooded murder of bystanders not the least of them. He only cares for himself and everyone else is here to service him or else be done away with.(If there was an unwritten series of rules to the WB gangster cycle, this must have been one of them.)While this is a classic I would say it is a minor classic because there isn't enough to it. Other parties are weak and the script seems little interested in them. The gangsters' moll (Virginia Mayo who died just before this review) is so off a production line that I was looking out for a bar code on her neck!Like all the greats Cagney looks incredibly modern in his acting style. He looks relaxed and doesn't seem to take himself too seriously. This is a wage packet, not art. He said that acting was about "standing on the balls of your feet and not on your heels." This is the movie that demonstrates that body posture the best.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This audacious masterpiece concerns a dizzyingly oedipal mobster (James Cagney) whose priapic instability (his father, also a hooligan, died in a sanitarium when Cagney was a boy) is literalized in migraine headaches set off by lack of maternal attention. Raoul Walsh's White Heat is hell on wheels, fueled by a powerful blend of narrative economy and vertiginous pacing that mimics the nature of its caustic protagonist.The film's structure is pared down to essences, reliant on a balanced cause-effect editing scheme. The result is an unyielding momentum that feels like a sustained two-hour climax. Buried between exuberant set pieces is the expository information one might normally discard in this well-established genre?like, say, the finer tactics a cop might employ when in pursuit of his adversary?that resonates here because of the creative and cutting-edge spin the writers continually put on the formula, rife with carefully conceived payoffs (e.g., the garish tracking device used to entrap Cagney in the refinery is introduced during a police briefing).The tour-de-force is as much Walsh's as it is Cagney's: a portrait of an irredeemable bastard and a paradigm of crackerjack storytelling that few crime films since have lived up to.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Top of the world, indeed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Raoul Walsh and Cagney made something remarkable together in White Heat. Cagney had played gangsters several times before, but never with such an intensity. Take for example the scene where Jarrett (Cagney) hears about his mother's death. all the extras in the scene where totally unaware what was going to happen, and it shows. It's such a powerful scene, equaled but never topped in the history of cinema. Raoul Walsh had made numerous films before, including gangster, adventure films and many more films starting from 1916. But without doubt this is his best film, a powerhouse that never loses it's grip. Part of its brilliance, is that it never tries to explain why Jarrett is so psychotic. It's just the way he is. The Mother- son relationship adds another interesting element to the movie, a twisted version of the most sacred institution of the society (family). Both of them are ruthless, calculating and completely ignoring the value of human life. But still they love and care about each other deeply, Jarrett being totally dependent on his old mother. Film has had much influence to the genre of crime films. Cold yet furious Jarrett has set an example for numerous villains that followed. it's admirable how you care what happens to this human monster, and its all because of Cagney, and great vision of Raoul Walsh. Film has great single scenes and images, for example Jarrett sitting in his mothers lap. Direction is very smooth, pace is fast, story is simple yet so effective. This film could have been just another story about a bad guy who in the end gets what he deserves. But it became a film to remember, with its immortal ending which was predictable because the film is about a mind which no society, no authority can chain or control.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cagney goes the limit in Walsh's unforgettable updating of ?30s gangster flick to film noir</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With White Heat, Raoul Walsh boldly and expertly welds the sound and fury of the ?30s gangster movie to the psychological disquiet of film noir. James Cagney dominates the movie from titles to credits as sociopath Cody Jarrett, the remorseless and unstable leader of a roving gang of modern-day desperadoes who pull train and payroll robberies throughout the West, piling up corpses in their wake. Cagney balances precariously between the two women in his life: his wife, fickle and easily bored Virginia Mayo, and his mother, Margaret Wycherly. There's little doubt that his heart belongs to Mommy, who kneads his neck when incapacitating headaches befall him and acts as consigliere and enforcer in his mob; the blonde and fur-swathed Mayo, by contrast, merely accessorizes his crime-boss persona ? a flashy possession, like a fedora or stickpin.Lying low after a brutal train hijacking, Cagney cops an alibi by confessing to a minor job in the Midwest, netting him an easy stretch in prison. In stir, he survives an attempt on his life arranged by a disgruntled gang member (Steve Cochran), but when Cagney learns of his mother's murder (by Cochran and Mayo) he throws a lavish psychotic fit; along with Bette Davis' last walk to the train in Beyond The Forest, this scene stands as one of 1949's most pyrotechnical acting stunts. Helping him through the breakdown is Edmond O'Brien, a federal agent who has been planted in the pen precisely to infiltrate Cagney's organization.After a jailbreak, Cagney returns to settle scores with Cochran, who has run off with Mayo. One last, big job remains: knocking over an oil refinery in Long Beach. But O'Brien, who got caught up in Cagney's crash-out, can't reach his superiors without blowing his cover....The large cast stays at a uniform level of excellence. Cagney scales yet another of his career pinnacles, while Wycherly and Mayo hit personal bests as well. O'Brien equals his performance as the dogged insurance investigator in Robert Siodmak's The Killers (later starring roles would show him as repetitious and stretched). A lot happens in White Heat, but Walsh paces expertly, with each incident flowing swiftly and seamlessly from the last (he's helped by a top-notch script by Virginia Kellogg, who also penned T-Men and Caged). Walsh builds towards a final confrontation (or conflagration) at the refinery, granting Cagney (like Brunnhilde) his own immolation scene. In one of the most iconic moments of the noir cycle, Cagney defiantly bestrides an oil dome, bellowing his triumphal `Made it, Ma ? Top of the world' through the explosions that engulf him and put an end to his destructive, delusional glory. It's an fiery final image that crowns one of the most unforgettable achievements of post-war cinema.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brutal, hard-hitting potboiler with Cagney on top of the game.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jimmy Cagney returns to familiar "Public Enemy" territory as a tightly-coiled, psychopathic killer with a severe Oedipus complex in "White Heat," a still potent crimer that has Cagney fighting off the "coppers" every which way in his inimitably jaunty, sneering, pugnacious style.Cagney stars as Cody Jarrett, the ringleader of a gang responsible for a wave of brutal crimes hitting California, the most recent being a train robbery in which two engineers were killed in cold blood. The heat's on after one of the robbers left for dead provides a posthumous clue as to who pulled the job. Cagney shrewdly decides to turn himself in on a lesser crime that he DIDN'T commit in order to allow himself an air-tight alibi for the more serious train killings. Sentenced to no more than two years in the pen, he figures he'll be out in no time to rejoin the gang and continue his life of crime.Despite rather stereotyped characters, the actors bring them vibrantly to life here. Blonde, brassy Virginia Mayo portrays Cagney's bored, two-timing wife, a typical gangster's moll who always has her eyes on a new mink. She expertly fills in for Mae Clarke (remember the ?grapefruit' scene in "Public Enemy"?) as the dame Cagney shoves around. And does she ever deserve it! A real turncoat, this gal plays both sides of the fence, selling her own mother down the river if given half the chance. Dark, broad-shouldered, hirsutely handsome Steve Cochran is perfect as the surly, ambitious member of the gang who cooks up a scheme to supplant the now-incarcerated Cody as ringleader while stealing the affections of his more-than-interested wife. Edmond O'Brien has all the right ingredients to play the dogged cop who wants to put Cody permanently behind bars by pinning the train murders on him. Placed in Jarrett's cell as a plant, he tries to worm his way into Cody's good graces in order to set him up for the inevitable fall. John Archer (actress Anne Archer's real-life father) is solid as O'Brien's immediate supervisor who puts the plan in action.The most intriguing angle in this straightforward drama is Cody's odd, unhealthy devotion to his overprotective ma, played with utter conviction by the superb Margaret Wycherly. As a child, it seems Cody used to feign headaches as an attention-getting device. He now suffers from constant migraines with ma always around with the magic hands to get rid off them. Fascinating stuff! A seemingly docile, sedate presence, Ma Jarrett nevertheless has "Ma Barker" instincts, playing a shrewd, prominent role within the gang. And as Cody's mouthpiece while in prison and the only person he trusts, she is resolute in protecting his ringleader image in absentia, taking on anybody in the gang who sees different.Pretty violent for its time, Raoul Walsh's crisp direction (he also helmed "The Roaring Twenties," another classic Cagney caper) keeps things moving at a fairly fast clip, while the excellent black-and-white photography and art direction give the film a real starkness. Max Steiner's imposing score should be mentioned as well. One other intriguing aspect is the updated "sophisticated" equipment the police use (circa 1949) in tracking down the whereabouts of the culprits, done in almost "Dragnet" series style."White Heat" is legendary, of course, for its fiery "top of the world" finale at the chemical plant and, while the scene undeniably deserves a place in Hollywood folklore, there is plenty about this movie leading up to its classic denouement, notably the riveting performances of both Cagney and Wycherly, that makes it stand on its own two feet.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Rough, uncompromising, and incredibly riveting, "Whote heat" is one of a kind. Cagney was definitely the right man for the job also. He excelled in some his previous roles as bad guys (like "Angels with dirty faces" which got him a nomination), but he outdid himself in "White heat". Cagney gives a little extra amount of energy in this one. The scene in the mess hall in prison shows how energetic he could be. Cody Jarrett (Cagney) is one of the biggest criminals across the country and does robberies with his crew all over the country. However, his most precious element is his mother who actually helps him commit the crimes and who claims "Top of the world son." as he claims "Top of the world Ma." and he cares immensely for her. But after having stolen a huge amount of money on a train leaving behind him four dead, Cody sees the trouble he is getting into and decides to surrender to be sent up the river for only two years by pleading guilty for another crime. Once in the can, the police send in Fallon (Edmond O'Brien) as a spy to obtain from Cody the necessary evidence to be able to prosecute him for the train robbery. But after Cody learns about the death of his mother, things go sour for Fallon and the cops' plans. The rest of the movie is Cagney's show and ends in a splendid way like no other movie has ever ended before. The ending scene will be recognized by movie-buffs. You should definitely see it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A great gangster film, with an older but no less magnificent James Cagney at the top of his game once more as he returns to the type of mobster role he swore off years ago. For Warner Brothers Crime Film Fanatics, this is a very welcome comeback that delivers the goods. Cagney plays a migraine-suffering psychotic gang leader with a crazy mommy obsession. His old "Ma" is a chief partner in his group of thugs, a lifetime veteran of the crime game herself, unscrupulously portrayed by Margaret Wycherly. She's made her son the hoodlum he is today, and is the most important thing in Cagney's warped life, and the only one able to ease the recurring headaches that frequently paralyze her nutty and irrational boy. His relationship with Ma even overshadows his own marriage with his neglected wife (Virginia Mayo). Classic lines abound (like the immortal "Top of the World, Ma!" speech) and Cagney lets it all hang out in a maniacal performance that leaves no stone unturned. When he goes off his rocker while serving a prison term, he begins to trust a sympathetic fellow inmate who's really an undercover police informant (Edmond O'Brien), out to nail Cagney.WHITE HEAT is an intense ride that gets going immediately and never lets up. **** out of ****</fullReview>

But I think that's why he did so well in these films, he acted.This is THE film of the tough-guy genre. This film kicks royal butt. James Cagney as Cody gives a tough performance..and I mean TOUGH as a gangster. He is mean! He is plagued with blinding headaches which can either be "all in his head" or a real ailment but with mean Cody, who knows. Only one thing holds him together and that's his..."ma".This film is an Odepus Complex in all its glory. Cody's girlfriend, or shall I say -- girlfriend of convenience -- can't even break that mother/son tie. Ever. Violence against women in this film? You betcha! Cody is SO mean and the film is very unflinching in showing it (in other words all women libbers better stay away from this one!!!) and not only does Cody gets his "licks" in, his mother is no ball of fun either.The "crime does not pay" theme is apparent in this film but what a way to go to get there! They don't make films like this anymore and it's sad. This is one of Cagney's best of this genre -- it's one of the top 15 Gangster Films of all time to me. Rent it, enjoy this one, its great!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cagney and Crew Pack A Brutal Punch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are two styles of Film Noir. The Noir of the 1940s is characterized by glossy production values, gumshoes and dangerous women, and complex plots that emphasize moral ambiguity. The Noir of the 1950s is characterized by a gritty realism and brutality and tends to place the criminal at center of the story. The 1949 film WHITE HEAT straddles the two styles--a fact that makes it "required viewing" for any one interested in the way Film Noir developed and changed over time.But WHITE HEAT is much more than a film with historical significance. It continues to pack quite a punch right up present day. At the time it was released many critics warned audiences about the movie's level of violence. By today's standards the violence isn't much: you won't find oozing gore. But WHITE HEAT bests most modern films in terms of brutality. You might not see the blood pouring, but the harsh tone of the film and its vicious characters create a sense of violence that generally outstrips more graphic modern films. The pace of the film is driving, the story and dialogue convincing, and the cast top-notch all the way.James Cagney spent much of the 1940s trying to distance himself from the gangster roles he created in the 1930s, but he returns to the genre in what may be his single finest performance as Cody Jarrett, career criminal, gang leader, and easily one of the most psychotic criminals Hollywood has ever portrayed. Backed by his equally dangerous mother and perfidious wife (Margaret Wycherly and Virginia Mayo, both of whom give the performances of their careers), Jarrett undertakes a train holdup--and when things get too hot tries to sidetrack the cops by taking a rap on a minor charge. But the cops are onto his tricks, and they place an operative in his cell, hoping to get the evidence they need to send him to the gas chamber.Although the plot is convoluted, director Raoul Walsh endows the film with considerable clarity, directness, and speed, and from the opening scenes of train robbery to the justly celebrated climax at the refinery, WHITE HEAT contains one memorable moment after another. Hard-driving, fascinating, and powerful, this is a must-have for any one who enjoys Film Noir.Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To date White Heat remains the only instance in which my first encounter with an actor instantly turned me into fan. Typically for me I become a fan of a performer over a period of time and after seeing a number of their films. Not James Cagney though. The scene early during White Heat in which Cody Jarrett gets a headache and needs to be comforted by his mother, my instant reaction was, "I need to watch any movie with this guy I can get my hands on". I have no hesitation putting Cagney's performance as Cody Jarrett in my ten favourite movie performance of all time. At this point in my movie watching life I had never seen an actor so on fire, so electrifying. His twitchy mannerisms, machine gun way of speaking his violence against women and possibly above all, his mother complex, exposing a unsettling, adorable side. Like wow, you do not want to be stuck in elevator with this guy. I would later discover White Heat came after the classic Warner Bros cycle of gangster movies, making White Heat a nostalgic revival of the genre, making Cody and his mother products of a different age. Margaret Wycherly as Ma Jarrett is the next great stand out performance for me, a character who appears as the stereotypical "aw shucks" mother common in classic Hollywood, but her attitude could not be more different.Boy is this movie fast paced. White Heat is one of the few times my heart my beating so much out of how exciting the movie was. When the film was over I had the closest I could fell to that sense you get after coming of a roller-coaster, expect getting it from watching a movie. I feel that's the best way to sum up White Heat, a roller-coaster of violence and emotions. Even the scenes of police officers discussing Cody's psychological tendencies and the examination of their late 1940's tracking techniques are riveting, but they do save the best for last. The Warner gangster movies ended with incredible final scenes with brilliant closing lines, White Heat's may be the best of them all. I question if I'll ever experience such a high level of movie watching euphoria on a first time viewing again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>White Heat : from a burning rise 'to the top of the world' to an explosive descent into madness...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1941, Raoul Walsh forever changed the face of gangsters; they would stop being these big shots defying the Law to rule the street with smiles and machine guns, becoming multifaceted loners living their life to the fullest before surrendering, if not to cops, to fate. It was the fate of "High Sierra", before World War II, to make the transition between gangster movies and film-noir turning Bogart, the 30's eternal outsider, into the new icon of the 40's. It also paved the way to a new generation of gangster-noir, a timely combination since noir has always been about disillusion and failure, embodying the condition of outlaws, who carelessly stole and killed to fulfill their instincts of greed, lust and power, yet ultimately failing.And the pioneering noir-gangster movie was "White Heat", whose Oscar-nominated script was based on Virginia Kellogg's bestseller. And while the film took distanced itself from its glorious predecessors to better absorb the elements of film noir, it did keep one thing in place: the villain. His name is Arthur 'Cody' Jarrett, 26th villain in the AFI's Top 50, and Cagney's career-defining performance. Indeed, just like Walsh who both closed the first gangster era and started the new one, it's all the more fitting that he picked the seminal gangster actor to redefine the genre he previously defined.Indeed, Cody is in a class of sadism and ruthlessness of its own. In the 30's, they were charismatic, then they became tragic like Rocky Sullivan in "Angels with Dirty Faces" or romantic like Bogart in "High Sierra", but Cody is beyond redemption. In the opening train robbery scene, coincidentally set in the same location "High Sierra" ended -as if the torch was definitely passed- Cody cold-bloodily kills a train engineer who remembered his name, then his partner. Later, he abandons one of his guys accidentally burnt during the robbery, Cody doesn't take any chance, he doesn't trust his men, and they don't trust him. And neither does his wife, the treacherous Verna, played by Virginia Mayo, who spends time whining and flirting with 'Big Ed', Steve Cochran as Cody's right-hand man, a big man, with 'big' ideas, who wouldn't mind filling Cody with lead to take the lead. But Cody has a guardian angel, although angel isn't quite an appropriate word. It's Ma Jarrett, played by Margaret Wycherly, in a 180 turn from her Oscar-nominated role as Sergeant York's devoted mother. She's still a loving mother but wouldn't a monster mother love her own child, for Ma Jarrett, nothing is too bad if it can her son to "the top of the world", their mutual motto.And when Cody is struck by one of his first headaches and outbursts of dementia, a condition inherited from his father who ended in an institution, he takes refuge in his room where his Ma gives him a drink and tenderly massages his head before getting him up on his feet. Cody is a living paradox, ruthless in one side, vulnerable in another, a pathologic sociopath but a cunning individual. Later, Cody manages to outsmart the Police by confessing a lesser crime committed the same time than the crime robbery to avoid gas chamber. This is where Inspector Fallon (Edmund O'Brien) intervenes; he must befriend his cell-mate Cody to track the mysterious 'trader' who makes business with him. From a study with Oedipal undertones, we get to the ancestor "Serpico", "Reservoir Dogs" and "Donnie Brasco". O'Brien delivers a fine acting-within-acting performance but the script leverages the actors' performances with so many subtle moments of tension where Fallon's credibility is challenged, like when he enters the cell and doesn't recognize his official wife's picture, officiously his intermediary. And we never know exactly if we want his cover to be blown or not. This is how ethically challenging and thought-provoking "White Heat" is. Cody is a maniac, but these betrayals inevitably make him sympathetic, the same goes to Big Ed, we despise the traitor he is yet we feel sorry for the bullets he took that should've gone to Verna. And of course, we can't help but feel an immense sorrow during the infamous breakdown when he learns about his mother' death. Walsh' strike of genius was not to tell the extras and the crew what Cagney would do and let him implode his talent to their face and when you look at O'Brien's genuinely bewildered face, you know that trick worked.Finally, as if it wasn't enough, another of "White Heat"'s remarkable aspects is the use of methodical police procedural and technology. Police isn't just a bunch of noble law enforcers, they're as methodical, rational and clever than their preys, whether for tailing Ma or tracking the gas truck used like a Trojan Horse to rob a chemical plant, never has shown them so efficient. All in all, "White Heat" carries a documentary-like realism, so needed in a genre that often requires suspension of disbelief. So this is where it goes: a psychological dilemma, an undercover story, a great robbery, a police procedural story of betrayal, cynicism and double-crossing, all that in one film.And all that follows Cody's "rise to the top" before marking his descent into madness. When Cody learns that Fallon is a copper, he's almost crying at his own naivety and we almost feel for him, the rest is pure existential nihilism, he gets away, not in the mountains of Sierra Nevada, but in a gloomy and cold chemical tank with globe-like tanks. Times have changed, it's not the Sierra Nevada, but technology, cold and unpredictable, just like Cody who start shooting everywhere at the cops, the tanks and his surrendering friends, like modern-antiheroes, he wanted his blaze of glory to die in.Cody's "Made it Ma! Top of the world" remains one of the most memorable exits of a character ever, the only possible one for such a spectacular gangster movie and multi-layered masterpiece</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Made it, Ma. Top of the world!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is on a recent list of "Top 10 Gangster Movies" and I had never seen it, although I like Cagney. My local public library has the DVD, which has a very nice audio and video transfer of this B&amp;W movie.The beginning isn't particularly interesting as it depicts a train robbery, which has been done too many times. But it only serves to set up the characters and the motives for the rest of the story. Four men are killed in the holdup, and police piece together clues that lead them to a certain gang. (Being a scientist, my favorite was the spectrographic analysis that showed dirt on a dead man matched dirt near the train robbery! Good for 1949.)The lead is played by James Cagney as Cody Jarrett. Virginia Mayo is his wife Verna Jarrett, but it appears that she is getting tired of the gangster wife lifestyle.Jarrett is suspected in the train robbery, but as a ruse he turns himself in to Springfield, IL police as the robber in a small-time job, because it became his alibi for the train robbery. He figured he would spend a little time in jail then get out to resume his big job robberies. The police suspect him so policeman Edmond O'Brien as Vic Pardo (not his real name) is set up to be in jail with Cody to learn the whole story, and set him up for capture and prosecution. Much of the movie is set in the prison.Really good was Margaret Wycherly as Ma Jarrett, Cody's mom, who has as much a gangster mind as did her son.Good movie to represent the genre and for Cagney.SPOILERS: There is a jail break, and Vic is among them. He manages to get an old radio working as a transmitter and rigs it onto a truck that carries them into a LA area chemical plant for a $460,000 robbery. Police follow them and corner the gang. One by one Cody's men get killed, until only he is left. Climbing to the top of a spherical pressurized gas storage tank, Vis, a sharpshooter, wounds Cody three times, but as he is about to die, shoots valves on the big tank, and a fire and explosion erupts. Right before he blasts off he yells, "Made it, Ma. Top of the world!"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jimmy Cagney is Arthur Cody Jarrett, murderer and gangster. He suffers from Caesar's falling sickness or something, but his mother is always there to cover for him so he doesn't lose his power over the gang -- or over his juicy, opportunistic wife (Virginia Mayo) either. "Only you can do that, Ma," sighs Cagney as his Mom gently rubs his parietals. Cagney and Ma often promise each other that he's going to get to the top of the world yet. During a short stretch in the pen, where a government snitch (Edmund O'Brien) sort of takes Ma's place in her absence, Cagney's executive officer in the gang (Steve Cochran) appropriates Cagney's wife and gang. Cagney and O'Brien crash out and Cagney settles Cochran's hash alright. In the end, Cagney is alone, trapped atop a giant tank of some explosive fluid, screaming into the empty night air, "Made it, Ma! TOP OF THE WORLD!" (Ka-boom.) It's one of the most famous last lines in the movies.Cagney had slaved away at Warner Brothers for years and finally went independent during the war years, only to have a string of flops, and then it was back to Warner's for this, his last role as a gangster. As Tommy Powers in "Public Enemy", Cagney was fine but young, and the narrative was fairly simple. His role as Cody Jarrett forced him to stretch his acting chops and he delivers. Oh, he still has the verve that brought him his early fame. He lurches forward with his leaning torso, legs stiff and mechanical, rather like James M. Cohan's dancing -- bouncy, psychotic. But by 1949 he knew when to slow down and how to shape his face into something other than a mask of indifference or a sneer. There is real pathos in this performance. He confesses to O'Brien, whom he's adopted as a kind of kid brother, that he spends a lot of time outside at night, talking to his dead mother. ("Maybe I am nuts.") And you can't help feeling that, for all his cold-blooded rage, he ought to be put away and treated. Tom Powers seemed to have free will, whereas Cody Jarrett is driven by things that he can't understand, like most of us. You want an acting lesson? Watch the scene in the Big House when Cagney learns his mother is dead, without a single close up, with no music at all to hype it up. There were other influences other than Cagney's own maturation. The depression that generated the 1930s gangsters was clearly a systemic problem. By 1948, a sociological position was beginning to look like communist propaganda. "There will be no more 'Grapes of Wrath.' There will be no more movies showing the seamy side of American life. No more movies with bankers as villains." (That's the head of the MPAA speaking.) From now on, if you were a criminal it would be your fault, not the system's. It's a pretty bleak movie. Except for Cagney and Ma, every single sign of loyalty or tenderness or care leads to betrayal. When he tells Ma that he can't trust anybody but her, he's absolutely right. His wife takes up with his rival and hopes Cagney dies in prison, and she's the one who kills Ma. His second in command grabs for everything while Cagney's in the slams.The worst of all is O'Brien's government agent, Fallon. O'Brien saves Cagney's life to get on his good side and uncover the secrets of him and his gang. He calculatingly takes Ma's place in prison, covering for Cagney during his spells. Cagney takes him on as a full partner. And in the end, O'Brien arranges to have Cagney cornered and, on top of that, he pitilessly shoots him full of holes with a high-powered rifle, while grumbling vexatiously, "What's holding him up?" As if he's hunting big game and can't understand why that grizzly doesn't drop. All in all, O'Brien's character is a really remorseless rat, though he's on the side of the law. Sidney Lumet ("Serpico", et al) would have made something entirely different out of this, but O'Brien would have been the protagonist.Raoul Walsh has directed with his customary zip. In one scene, a car is being trailed by several others through the streets of LA. The pursuit is taken at 20 or 30 miles an hour. One can almost feel Walsh ITCHING to speed the whole thing up. A twenty-mile-an-hour CHASE? An oxymoron!It's a fast movie, notwithstanding. As in the 1930s WB films, we leap from scene to scene with just enough dialog to keep us filled in on what's happening. In a drive-in scene, Cagney points to the speaker and he doesn't tell Mayo to "turn that thing off." He snaps, "Kill it," and cuts the syllables in half. But, as the mechanical engineers tell us, you can get speed but you sacrifice power to do it. The same story could easily have been 15 minutes longer and would have gained some of the depth its dynamic deserves. And the script keeps noodging us too. Steve Cochran tells another gang member that Cagney is nuts and he won't be in charge for long, and the other asks if Cochran's got anybody in mind for the next boss. "Yeah, a good friend of mine -- me." The line would have been more telling, more trusting of the audience, without that "me". And it's always a little puzzling when a character comes up with something like what Cochran tells Mayo, "The world ain't big enough. He'll find you." Why should Cagney, now hors de combat, ever find Mayo if she takes off? Suppose the pair had pulled up stakes, moved to, say, Tonopah, Nevada, and opened a Dairy Queen? How the hell would Cagney find them? That's all carping, though. Cagney is splendid and his gleeful violence unforgettable. A must-see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>White Heat was the first Cagney film I had the pleasure of viewing. I was blown away by the performance Cagney gives and I remain a big fan of the actor. White Heat is the story of a hardened crook, Cody Jarret, who even though of his harsh acts of violence remains a momma's boy at heart. Cody has been seeking his mother's attention as a young boy and faked headaches to get her to concentrate solely on him. Now these headaches Cody used to fake are now real and cause him tremendous pain. Now in the film Cody Jarretgives him self up for a lesser crime he committed to avoid getting caught for a more serious crime (the train robbery in the opening scenes). In the prison Cody befriends an undercover cop, Vic Pardo, played by Edmond O'Brien. After spending sometime in the prison Cody decides he had enough and escapes with his prison crew which includes Vic Pardo. After the daring escape Cody finds himself joining his old and new crew for what is supposed to be a major score. The crew decides to rob a chemical plant using the "Trojan Horse" tactic, a story Cody remembers from his childhood. Though the score goes sour when Vic Pardo sends a distress siganl using a radio. The police are their to great Jarret and his thugs shortly after they arrive at the plant. Then after a massive gun battle Cody is running from the police in the plant. Cody finds himself "on top of the world" at the closing of the movie devoting his final words to his mother.The ultimate gangster film and a must see for any classic movie fan. Of course most movie critiques would comment on the relationship between Cody and his mother though I feel more interesting is the relationship between Cody and his wife Verna Jarret portrayed by Virgina Mayo. The reason this relationship is so fascinating to me is because Verna's motives are always questionable. I believe that Verna is jealous of Cody's affection toward his mother and this what I believe drives her to one of Cody's thugs and also why she has Cody's mother killed amongst other reasons.ONce again I say this film is a must see for any movie goer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>White Heat</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From director Raoul Walsh (The Thief of Bagdad, High Sierra) this is a film listed in the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die that I was absolutely urging to see, because of the high acclaim, especially for the leading actor. Basically Arthur 'Cody' Jarrett (James Cagney) is a ruthless and deranged criminal gang leader, he is married to Verna (Virginia Mayo) but still overly attached to his equally twisted and decisive mother, Ma Jarrett (Margaret Wycherly), he considers her his partner in crime, and when he suffers severe headaches and epilepsy she gives him a glass of whiskey and toasts "Top of the world", her common expression. Him and his gang commit a train robbery in the High Sierra, in which he four men were killed, including his accomplice Zuckie (Ford Rainey) who was severely burned by train steam, the police close in but Cody manages to shoot and injure US Treasury investigator Philip Evans (John Archer), but he confesses to the authorities for a lesser crime committed the same day as the train robbery, in Springfield, Illinois. He is sentenced for this crime to two to three years in prison, but Philip knows better, he sends undercover agent Hank Fallon (The Wild Bunch's Edmond O'Brien) to join the gang leader in his cell as a fellow prisoner, under the name Vic Pardo, in Illinois State Penitentiary, Hank's mission to find who is laundering money for him. While Cody's right-hand man 'Big Ed' Somers (Steve Cochran) is on the outside plotting against the gang leader and his wife, he pays convict Roy Parker (Paul Guilfoyle) to kill Cody, he attempts dropping a heavy piece of machinery on him, but Hank saves him, and next Ma Jarrett visits and says she will take care of Big Ed. Worried what is happening Cody plans to break out, but then he finds out his mother is dead, he goes berserk in the mess hall and is dragged away to be put in a straight jacket, it is in the infirmary he is diagnosed with homicidal psychosis and recommended to be transferred to an asylum. Cody manages to get hold of a gun, and holding guards hostage he escapes, alongside Hank and Parker who is locked in the car trunk, he is later shot several times whilst still in there after calling out for air, and given "air holes", the remaining men continue the journey to California. Big Ed hears about Cody's escape and is sure he will eventually show up, Verna wants to get away as well, she was in fact the one who killed Ma, but when Cody catches her she convinces him that Big Ed killed his mother, Cody guns him down, the gang welcome the other escapees, including Hank, who Cody seems to see as a true friend now, and they plan their next job. An unknown man shows up at the gang's isolated country hideout, the gang are sure that Cody will kill whoever it is, Hank tells them he will investigate, but he is surprised to find out it is Daniel "The Trader" Winston, the man he was ordered by the authorities to find. Cody's big plan is to commit a robbery at a chemical plant in Long Beach, California, using Trojan horse style tank trucks to hide in, Hank manages to warn Philip of the plan, and ambush is ready to catch them, but at the plant when the robbery commences one of the crooks, 'Bo' Creel (Ian MacDonald) recognises Hank as the man who arrested him four years ago. Cody knows now that Hank was really undercover to catch him out, and that is when the police have surrounded the building and Philip demands his surrender, with the gang refusing tear gas is fired into the building, Hank manages to escape, and many of the henchmen are gunned down, and even Cody shoots and kills the gang members who want to give themselves up, Verna is there to be taken in as well. Finally Cody climbs to the top of a globe shaped gas storage tank, he is shot several times by Hank with a rifle, and knowing it is all over for him Cody fires at the tank to ignite a fire, he shouts "Made it, Ma! Top of the world!", before the tank and others beside it explode and he is killed in the blast. Also starring Wally Cassell as Giovanni 'Cotton' Valletti and Mickey Knox as Het Kohler. This film was absolutely made for Cagney, he plays the demented and sadistic gang leader and criminal to the hilt, Wycherly is terrific as the equally twisted mother, and O'Brien does well as the undercover agent trying to get in the criminal's good books. This has all the right elements for a fantastic film full of sinister criminals and the ones trying to catch them in the act and bring them to justice, filled with a fair amount of violence and distress, double crossing and plotting, and an overall feel of a nightmarish excursion, which you can find funny, this is an essential must see classic crime drama. Cody Jarrett was number 26 on 100 Years, 100 Villains, James Cagney was number 8 on 100 Years, 100 Stars - Men, and "Made it, Ma! Top of the world!" was number 18 on 100 Years, 100 Quotes.

By turns angry, sneering, loony, and laughing like a hyena, the diminutive actor is always in overdrive, a caricature more than a character. As his abused wife, Mayo shows her limitations as an actress. However, the worst performance is given by Wycherly as Cagney's mother, with her big round eyes and robotic delivery better suited to a horror movie. Compared to this trio, O'Brien and Archer do OK as federal agents. Walsh, one of the better action film directors of the era, manages to keep things interesting despite the poor acting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cagney's Fine Performance In A Dull Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Cody Jarrett (James Cagney) is a violent, psychopathic outlaw and the ringleader of a group that robs a train headed for California, in this noir gangster film written in semi-documentary style. As a killer, Cody is the bad guy. Yet, he must confront enemies that in some ways are even worse. He must deal with traitors inside his own gang. He also must outwit a much more difficult enemy, the U.S. government, which uses lies and deceit to trap him. And so by comparison, viewers sympathize with Cody, a strait shooter and basic loner who, though pugnacious, is tough, pragmatic, smart, and gutsy.Cody draws inspiration from his mama (Margaret Wycherly) who tags along with the gang, cooking and shopping. While trust is hard to come by among gang members, Ma Jarrett and Cody psychologically depend upon, and reinforce, each other. Mom eggs her son on, and at one point intones: "You're the smartest there is, Cody". And when mom says she could have made a mistake, Cody responds: "Your hunches are never wrong, Ma". Hints of Freud, maybe?When Cody uses prison as a way to avoid a more serious rap, the Fed sends in an undercover detective who assumes the name of Vic Pardo (Edmond O'Brien), to trap Cody and get inside info on the gang. One of my complaints about the script is that Pardo doesn't act like a real prisoner; he acts like an undercover cop. And so the character just isn't believable. Yet the Pardo character and some inserted plot twists keep the story moving to its less than realistic conclusion. Another problem is the script's prison interlude segment. It's too long and too talky. This section could have been cut in half and still maintained essential plot points.B&amp;W cinematography is acceptable but nothing special. Background score is too loud and intrusive most of the time. Production design is largely invisible, which is what we would expect for a 1940s crime film. Casting is okay. And the acting is somewhat above average, with the best performances coming from Cagney and Wycherly."White Heat" is really a James Cagney cinematic vehicle. The entire plot revolves around his character and his relationship to those who come into his orbit. Though this is a fine character study, and Cagney gives a fine performance, the overall story is a bit dull and tedious for me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Good Noir, But Not The Greatest Film Ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If anything, `White Heat' is a one-man show, and I'm not saying that because that's how it's written or even made, but because James Cagney reaps attention whenever he's on screen. His performance is a mixture of fierce, subtle rage and over the top antics, the same mix that helped Al Pacino become so popular. And like Pacino, Cagney's over acting is not a blemish to the film. It's used to make a character larger than life, and Cody Jarrett is most certainly that. The supporting cast doesn't stick out, even though there are some good performances. Cagney overshadows them all, which is both a good and bad thing, because it leaves the film without strong supporting characters. Walsh's favors wide shots, and him and cinematographer Sidney Hickox set up some great looking shots. It was the first gangster film to really have that epic scope along the lines of `The Godfather'. Overall though, it feels as if Walsh was afraid to stretch the noir boundaries too much, and there a few scenes that suffer for it. Besides a classic Cagney performance and good directing, the movie isn't much else. The story is pretty much a by the books noir film, which had reached it's peak by the end of the 40's. They only real atypical element of the film was Jarrett, who is written to be basically a stone cold nutzo without the palest hint of what motivates him, a new idea that I think didn't work to the best of it's potential. I never really hated Cody Jarrett, and the screenplay doesn't given anything else besides that option. It has some snappy dialogue here and there, but for the most part it's rather bland noirish stuff. Cagney's great, sure, but it is a performance that walks a thin into being too overblown, which thankfully Cagney never does. Walsh's is a great director who wasn't valiant to bring this to the level of rawness it could've been (the element is present, no doubt, but it feels too restrained). Everything else is rather average old Hollywood noir stuff, neither great nor terrible. See it for Cagney, but don't expect the revolution some think this movie is.7/10* * * / * * * *</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There seems to be a fairly universal opinion that this is if fine example of the gangster genre and that the brothers Warner elected to terminate a genre they had made their own on a high - if not indeed a classic - note. Warners had something of a corner on charismatic gangsters, boasting three of the finest in Bogie, Cagney and Eddie Robinson and White Heat makes a fine swan song. Whilst it is easy to praise Cagney in the lead it has to be said that the support is all out of the right bottle not least Margaret Wycherley as the Jocasta figure to Cagney's Oedipus and the ever reliable Eddie O'Brian as the undercover cop who infiltrates the Jarrett mob.

I do not like betrayals, therefore I simply hated the character of Edmond O'Brien, Vic Pardo, who seems to be sicker than Cody. How can a sane man accept to stay in prison for more than one year just to find stolen money? The story is very violent for a 1949 movie, and James Cagney is perfect in the role of a deranged and dangerous leader. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): "Fria Sanguinria" ("Bloody Rage")</fullReview>

That he may have been - But, for me, while watching White Heat, I certainly wasn't anywhere near that level of nirvana, myself - No. Not by a long shot.Over the years I have been told, time and again, that White Heat was, in fact, a true "Classic" of 1940s Crime films. Well, in my opinion, the only way that I could ever call White Heat a "Classic" would be solely in terms of its disappointment factor. I mean, to be fair, White Heat wasn't awful, but, then again, by the same token, it sure didn't live up to its "so-called" legendary reputation, either.For one thing - White Heat was way-way too long for my liking. About a good half an hour could've easily been trimmed from its running time. Yeah. That whole inexplicable focus on Cody's stay in prison became totally tedious beyond words.Another disappointment in White Heat was Cagney's less-than-electrifying performance as the psychotic suck, Cody Jarrett. I mean - A few face-slaps here, a couple of "Shuddups!" there, some agonized head-holding, and a string of predictable wisecracks certainly didn't add up to a very interesting character, in my books.Cagney was 50 at the time of this film, and if his character was really supposed to be this insanely devoted momma's boy that he was, then I could never-ever, in a zillion years, be convinced that he could've ever landed himself such a hot, young and (fairly) understanding wife like Verna (even if she was just two-faced white-trash). No way, Jose. Like, please spare me having to suspend disbelief about Cody by that much. OK? All-in-all - White Heat was mediocre movie-entertainment. Like - C'mon, all you vintage movie fans out there - Let's face it - There are, by far, so many other 40s Crime films out there that can, and do, surpass this one by a literal country mile.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Huh?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>**spoilers**While reading the comments for this movie, I was shocked to find that not a single person had anything bad to say about it. Now, I liked the movie, but calling it the greatest or even among the greatest gangster movies of all time is absolutely ludicrous. I found it to be a pretty well put together cops and robbers thriller that had some exciting moments and some good scenes. However, Cagney's acting is completely unworthy of all the accolades it has gotten. He's wooden and uninteresting at all moments when he's trying to show any emotion beyond crazy. For example, when he finds out his mother has been murdered, he staggers around a little and punches some guards, as I'm sure the director instructed him to, but you get no sense of any sadness. Also, why bother showing the extent to which he takes the undercover cop under his wing only to have the cop coolly put four bullets from a sniper rifle at him without so much as a blink to show that he regrets having to do it. I guess what I'm saying is that if this movie were robot theater, where emotions are of no importance, it would be terrific, but as a human I just wanted a little more.</fullReview>
