		<fullReview>Mohenjo Daro was one of my most anticipated movies of 2016, and well, it wasn't good. This is probably the most disappointing movie I've seen all year unfortunately. Even though it's directed by the great Ashutosh Gowariker, it has so many problems that make it a very disappointing movie.As always, I'll start with the positives. Hrithik Roshan is great in this role and by far the best part of the movie. Pooja Hegde is good as the female lead and I can see her as a future Bollywood star. A.R. Rahman's music is phenomenal and certain action scenes were done well. That's about it.My biggest problem with the film is that it doesn't know what kind of movie it wants to be. There's so many story-lines that are left hanging by the end of the film. The plot is so muddled and somewhere in there is a good movie with a good story. Kabir Bedi as the villain is pretty disposable but his character's son is even worse. The last 30 minutes of the movie are a complete awful shoehorned in subplot trying to make Hrithik's character looking like Noah and Moses. Overall, Mohenjo Daro is an extremely disappointing movie and wasted potential. This could have been another masterpiece for Gowariker but it is a mess of a movie.Mohenjo Daro gets a D.Check out my video review of the film!: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5yqOrZuYBA</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mohenjo Daro Review!! Must Watch Movie of the year.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mohenjo Daro, starring Hrithik Roshan and Pooja Hegde is a period drama based on ancient Indian civilization, which the whole country feels proud about. The movie showcases the life and day to day activities of ancient times and also revolves around a story of a peasant (Hrithik) who falls in love with a Princess (Pooja). The film has all the elements to entertain the audiences such as old world charm, never seen before spectacles and backdrops, a twist of love, romance and action. The film's action scenes will keep you at the edge of your seat. If ancient civilization excites you, then this film is a must watch under all terms. Director: Ashutosh GowarikarCast: Hrithik Roshan, Pooja Hegde Plot: Mohenjo Daro is set in 2016 BC and showcases ancient Indian civilization in all its glory. Hrithik (Sarman) who plays the role of a simple farmer, lands himself in the town of Mohenjo Daro and is mesmerized by its beauty and grandeur. Sarman comes to the city with a hidden agenda and works as a peasant. During a street mishap he saves the life of Princess Chaani and ends up falling in love with her. Chaani is the chosen one to serve 'Sindhu Ma' who is a river Goddess, and the whole city is very devoted to her. Trouble starts when Sarman abandons his hidden agenda and tries to woo Chaani, but falls afoul to the politician Maham (Kabir Bedi) who wants to rule Mohenjo Daro all by himself as a dictator. Maham's son Moonja, does his best to make Sarman go off route and uses him as a pawn so that his father can seize control of the whole city. To win over Chaani, Sarman has to defeat Maham &amp; Moonja and save the city from destruction at the evil hands of the father-son duo. Will Sarman save the town from the evil whims of Maham &amp; Moonja? Or will he unleash his hidden agenda and destroy the city all by himself? Can he win over the love of his life Chaani? For that you will have to hit the theatres! We're sure you'll never be disappointed. Performances: Hrithik Roshan is back with a bang and has delivered a stellar performance in Mohenjo Daro. His acting skills are on full display and he has pulled off an excellent feat with this one. The dedication he has poured into the action scenes are immense and he has done justice to his role overall. Coming to Pooja Hegde, the actress has managed to pull off both 'sweet and mean' avatars in the film. She can mesmerize you by her sheer beauty and can make you sit at the edge of your seat during her fight scenes. There's no doubt that Pooja Hegde is here to stay in Bollywood and Mohenjo Daro will be an epitome of her success. Technicalities: Ashutosh Gowariker has a lot of experience when it comes to period drama films and has left no stone unturned when it comes to Mohenjo Daro. The ancient city is shown perfectly the way it should be and the larger than life sets will leave you amazed. The film takes you back all the way to 2016 BC and will make you believe that whatever is shown on screen is so damn true. Such is the charismatic work of the film-maker and kudos to him for pulling off such a spectacular feat. The camera angles focus on every inch of the city and its all woven together really well. Thumbs up to the team of Mohenjo Daro on this one! Verdict: A must watch! These kind of movies come rarely in Bollywood and Mohenjo Daro should never be missed at any cost. There is love, drama, action, romance and to top it all, there is an ancient civilization shown so perfectly that you'll end up falling in love with it.I will rate Mohenjo Daro 9 out of 10!! Go and watch</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I usually don't write reviews but after reading reviews from other users I feel obligated to write about this movie. Also I am not getting paid for this review. I feel that movie was great, it depends on the angle you look at. Those who are looking for typical 3rd grade movie this is not for you. Director tried to keep the focus on reality versus adding spices The movie shows what we read in the history. You can't satisfy all population, but those who are looking for something different then typical 3rd grade movie, you will love the movie. It's worth spending $10 and 2.5 hours of your time. Some people have no taste for movies and they are giving bad reviews to such a good movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>first of all if you want to see new plot then this movie is not for you.I think this movie is like a pioneer and enjoyable if you watch with family or with friends.Story line : 5 (predictable) Picturisation : 8 (Good one because i think they succeeded in creating old historic time) Action: 7 better than other Bollywood movies which have stupid type action scenes. Acting : 6 Hritik(Hero) done just fine but Pooja Hegde(heroine) just looks beautiful and lovely. Music/Background : 8.5 Rahaman done another good work you. Special Effects : 7 Good Work. So Overall movie is little loose in Story and Acting but if you keep your mind close to movie you will definitely like the movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The trailer of MohenjoDaro doesn't do justice to the film. It engages &amp; entertains u from the very beginning right upto the riveting climax! Brilliant piece of movie. Asutosh Surpassed my expectation. Hrithik is the heart and soul of this movie. Hrithik's fight sequence will blow ur mind. His intensity is unmatched. He is treat to watch. Hrithik's passion For his craft shows in each &amp; every frame. Kabir Bedi and Arunoday's menacing acts r the perfect match for Hrithik's heroic performance. Romance with Pooja Hegde shine beautifully. She was truly amazing to watch. Asutosh Goariker's Vision of making MohenjoDaro deserve a standing ovation. Best of him so far.MohenjoDaro is a perfect blend of a good story good acting and direction. Kudos to team MOHENJODARO.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Forget the rest. Mohenjo-Daro is the best. Go everyone watch the movie. Complete balance of romance,revenge,touch of history. Fully action packed cinema with admixture of romance, drama, revenge, well VFX etc. Pooja hedge's acting was not according to the mark, but Hrithik really ruled the entire film with his action, romance, acting etc. Kabir Bedi is one of the best villains of all time that's why Hollywood took his name for the Bond film(Octopussy). Well directed by Ashutosh, managed to balance the film in all aspects expect one song. Little error of dialogues are seen throughout the movie, would be best if those mistakes are rectified before the launch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't really watch that many Bollywood movies but I was looking forward to Mohenjo Daro since some time. Watched the movie a while back and liked it a lot. If you don't know it already, it's set in the Indus Valley Civilization(in the year 2016 B.C.). The movie is ambitious and grand. It is fast paced and has you engaged till the end. It has got some great action as well as imagination. The performance by the cast is solid, the background music is brilliant and Ashutosh Gowariker has done a superb job. I have no complains about this movie.Don't believe the bad reviews by the so called "critics"(not just for this movie but also for others). Watch it for yourself and make up your mind. Highly recommend it as it is more than a typical Bollywood movie. I've been seeing lots of positive reviews by moviegoers for the movie on social media. There has been an upward trend as far as the collections are concerned. It may keep on doing better with positive word of mouth.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Watched #Mohenjodaro. It is not only a typical Bollywood movie that we are always watching. Actually its a wonderful cinematic experience, that dwells you in that era of Hadappa and Mohenjodaro. After some time you feel that you are also part of Mohenjodaro. AshutoshGowariker has taken care of each and every minor thing. Hrithik's performance is mind blowing as expected. PoojaHegde is pretty. While returning from cinema hall you will surely get something hing to learn and you will become more curious to know about ancient Indian history and civilization.Thank you ashutosh govarikar giving treat of this movie. I enjoyed a lot. Rehman's music is outstanding. Hats off to all actor actresses.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Our history is what makes us special but Mohenjo Daro has just made history special.The movie takes you on an epic journey back in time to an untold story of love,rediscovering history like never before. Mohenjo Daro is another one of those masterpieces that appears once in a blue moon only to leave the audience awed by its perfection in direction, passionate music, superb acting, vibrant cinematography, breath taking scenes, stunning costumes and all the other unmentioned achievements that will drive you to watch it over and over again. It has portrayed the ancient world down to the detail showing the cultural diversities and the hardships of the poor without wasting a single shot and only a mastermind director like Ashutosh Gowariker could achieve such perfection.Mohenjo Datong boggles the mind touches the heart and is a must watch for the entire family as it's entertaining for people of all ages, the old and the young. I highly recommend watching it and we hope to see more like it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Watched Mohenjo Daro today! Had 0 expectations because of some negative reviews. But the movie surprised me! It is BRILLIANT! The first half sets the tone of the movie. It can be a bit slow for some viewers, but if you love History, you will surely love the sets, the small small things which Ashutosh has taken care of. The second half starts with a Bang! And I will not tell you what the bang is! The Arena Fight is AWESOME! The CLIMAX is Breathtaking! The music and BGM gives goosebumps! It is certainly one of Hrithik's best performance. He is the only actor in Bollywood who can do such roles with such finesse. I will urge all cinema lovers, who love good movies, to GO OUT AND WATCH THIS MOVIE IN THEATRE. You will not see something like this in near future. Mohenjo Daro is a must watch for its breathtaking stunts, awesome visuals, melodious music, and power-packed performance of Hrithik Roshan! Go Go Go! Watch Mohenjo Daro!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hi All,So the movie starts with people speaking some Mohenjo Daro period language, we thought its not Hindi movie but after 10 Min's Hindi comes in to Picture we were relived that its not some other language. Film starts with Sarman(Hrithik) a fighting with a giant crocodile. As that crocodile was threat for the Village. He pictured as a brave boy and he is a son of a Farmer. He dreamt about a animal who has one horn(aka Eksingha)and dreamt about Mohenjo Daro. And Eksingha is a symbol of Mohenjo Daro the City. So, he always tell about his dream to his parent and ask about that animal he dreamt about and about Mohenjo Daro but his parents always ignore him. He eagerly wants to go to Mohenjo Daro the city but his parents don't allow him. Now what Mohenjo Daro is??? Mohenjo Daro is a high class city of that time with all best facilities that mankind have on that time period like New York. And it was built near Sindhu RiverPeople been there for business for earnings and it attracts lots of foreigner too.So after lots of try finally Hrithik parents allowed him to been to Mohenjo Daro. Then the direction and screenplay is just awesome, the set is brilliant but graphics is not up to the mark. Then finally our Sarman reached to Mohenjo Daro, and he finds it similar as he dreamt about. Then Pooja Hegde(Chaani)enter into the movie and she is a daughter of priest and some astrologer predict that she gonna decide the future of Mohenjo Daro. In between you never feel bored you will be inside the movie and nice direction and screenplay. Then Maham(King of Mohenjo Daro)entry. He is like wolf very clever and he wants all illegal things done by hook and crook. Then slowly both Sarman and Chaani starts liking each other. And even Maham(King) sons also likes Chaani.Then film goes but Chaani father promised King that kings son will get married to her daughter. But after meeting Sarman he wants her daughter too be marry with him. After that priest, Chaani father came to know about Hrithik that Hrithik was son of Former King then he said whole story how Maham the current king cheated Sarman father and become king.Movie goes smooth second half is quite interesting and we never felt bored on it.In between Hrithik killed Maham son and all Mohenjo Daro peeps start liking Hrithik.Then last 20 Min's quite interesting, there is a heavy rain going on and the Dam is about to break which covers whole whole city. And then Hrithik took decision to Vacate the city as once dam will break it gonna destroy whole city.Then how hrithik creates the bridge and save people is quite interesting and inspirational.And at the end whole Mohenjo Daro get destroyed and buried inside water.Story i feel bit common but acting done by Hrithik and Pooja is exceptional.Nice directed, awesome screenplay.I found it good, i suggest if you are a History lover you should go. And peeps who love light hearted movies they might found this boring.I watched both the movies Rustom and Mohenjo Daro,,,both are good but Mohenjo Daro will give you a unforgettable remembrance,,,you keep thinking about it once u leave theater.Thanks for reading :)</fullReview>

The story is good so it keeps you engaging throughout the movie and the background score is one of the best of Rehman's work...Hrithik's performance is the best in this movie , pooja hegde manages to do her role well and other actors also play their part really well.The battle scene after the interval is a visual treat and the performance of Hrithik in that particular scene is just pure brilliance ...Totally worth watching it in the theaters........&#x1f44f;&#x1f44f; &#x1f44f;&#x1f44f;&#x1f44f;</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gorgeously shot, carefully scripted, brilliantly directed, and carried on the broad shoulders of a superb lead performance, Mohenjo Daro is the sprawling epic befitting the grandeur of one of earliest urban civilizations known to man. To be honest, first half was gripping. Though there were no scenes with such adrenaline rush still the story has a grip on u. Humour and romance do the job for 1st half. Second half, mysteries unfold! Arena fight! Just wow! Wild! Raw action! Some scenes r there when even u may react as if u r being hit! Till first half 7/10 would have been the rating! Before the climax 8/10. That's it! And then there was the climax!! Beyond thinking!! Just beyond thinking! VFX was really good! The climax raised the bar!! Must watch!! This one truly satisfied my expectations. 9.5/10 from my side! 0.5 extra for Hrithik Roshan's awesome performance!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mohenjo Daro is an outstanding movie. Loved the performance by Hrithik and perfect direction by Ashutosh Gowariker. The plot is pretty simple and that is the beauty of this movie that with a really simple plot they gave us a movie worth watching again. Music by AR Rahman gave goosebumps, it was wonderful. You can really feel the magic of the tremendous amount of work that was put in this movie. Pooja hegde beautifully portrayed the role of Channi and the evil role completely suited Kabir bedi. There is something about this film just like any other Ashutosh Gowariker's film ( Lagaan, Swades) I mean you get emotionally attached with it. The fights were realistic and not typical bollywood type. I generally don't like period movies but this was something different. Simple and beautiful.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Greatest movie ever seen on the big screen!!The performances are nothing short of fantastic .Hrithik Roshan becomes Sarman and not once do you feel you are watching Hrithik on the screen. He is beyond brilliant and carries the film on his broad shoulders throughout. The way he emotes and delivers his lines shows that he is a super performer. This easily has to rank as the best performance of his career.Also, the Hrithik and Pooja chemistry is as flawless as ever. They sizzle every scene they are in together.My advice to the audience is to not miss Mohenjo Daro because doing so would be a huge mistake. It is a masterpiece and a definite must see. Don't miss it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Remarkable, but still undiscovered</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was very excited for watching Mohenjo Daro from the day its production was announced as I love history and was amazed when I came to know that a Bollywood movie is going to be made on the Indus valley civilization (no one has made a movie on it before). My excitement doubled when I realized Hrithik Roshan would be the lead (returning after 2 long years) and that it would be directed by Ashutosh Gowariker. I am a big fan of both of them as they are versatile, hardworking and have given the world some masterpieces worth cherishing. It was obvious that a lot of work was needed to be done for such a film and that's exactly what the crew did, from research to costumes and from music to cinematography. The teasers seemed very interesting and were a visual treat and the music was a treat to the ears. It became one of the most anticipated movies of 2016. After some days, a section of society considered themselves to be highly qualified archaeologists (more qualified than the ones who shared their research with the director) and constantly ridiculed the movie for its authenticity and negatively publicized it on social media. I think that it is unfair to point fingers on such a brilliant and eminent director and doubt his work. I watched the first show of Mohenjo Daro on the first day of its release and here are its strengths and weaknesses.Strengths: - Characterization/Acting: All the characters are beautifully written, vibrant, memorable and seem genuine, be it the cruel Maham or the friendly Hojo. It is obvious in every frame that the complete cast has given their best for the film. This is, without a doubt one of Hrithik's best and unforgettable performances. He (and the whole crew as well) dedicated almost 2 years for this film and literally went through a lot of physical hardship (broken bones). Pooja hegde is a good actress and looked nice opposite Hrithik but she had a rather limited role in the movie but she had the potential to do more.- Cinematography: The film is visually appealing and beautifully shot, which is due to its exquisite and complex set, which was in the making for almost a year (situated in Bhuj). The arena scene is the highlight of the movie. - Music: The music is mesmerizing and goes well with the visuals, background score is equally brilliant. This is not AR Rahman's best work but it still has magic in it. - Action: Action sequences are very well choreographed and a treat to watch on the big screen. By far, the movie has some of the best action ever seen in a period Bollywood film. Hrithik does complete justice to the action scenes, no one could have done it better than him. - Direction/Research: The efforts for research and authenticity of the film which the director has put in are worth applauding. He consulted expert archaeologists around the globe, who worked on the excavation of the Indus valley sites, and weaved a love story into it. The set and props of the film are based on the research while the story is totally fictitious. Whatever we know about that era is available in front of us in form of artifacts in various museums, and all the aspects of the era can be understood by the research and the speculations made by the archaeologists. No one can guarantee what was actually around at that time because no person lives today to tell the tale about it. And the Sindhu script hasn't been deciphered yet. There is the scene in the beginning of movie in which all the characters are conversing in an un-deciphered language and slowly the language is transitioned to Hindi so that the movie viewer can understand what's going on, justifying the above statement. Weaknesses: - Story/Screenplay: I was expecting a lot from its story but unfortunately it turned out to be the movie's weakness. Various elements of the characters and story are borrowed from Baahubali: The Beginning (2015). The part which is not borrowed makes this film unique. Overall, the fictitious story was not bad, but one would have expected something new from this big a movie. Some unintentional comedy scenes are present, which disturb the flow and intensity of the movie. The movie should have been more intense. Some romantic scenes seemed ridiculous, they should have had more depth. Do not expect detailed history lessons from the film, because it won't deliver. - VFX: VFX was poor in some parts, especially the crocodile scene and the climax. VFX needed to be better than what it was, for a movie made on such a huge budget.- Editing: Editing should have been stronger, to make the movie more intense and enjoyable. Quantity does not always promise quality. Some comedy and miscellaneous scenes should have been cut. Conclusion: I had a lot of expectations for this movie and they were not met. The movie was enjoyable in parts and was predictable due to its clichéd story line. It is a wonderful experience to watch it on the big screen. The second half of the movie is much more enjoyable than the first. Cheers to the team for making such a movie, but they could have done tremendously better. It is facing high criticism from some of the critics and the viewers, but this movie deserves a chance. It is not as bad as the critics make it look. It is a must watch for Hrithik fans and historical film lovers. The film sure does have its moments.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ashutosh Gowarikar is a genius and you just cannot complain much about the direction. The sets and cinematography are top-notch which has made it a visual treat. The action sequences are very well executed. About the music, Mohenjo Mohenjo and Tu Hai songs create magic on screens. The background score is sheer brilliance and gives you goosebumps. About the performance, Hrithik Roshan undoubtedly has delivered one of his career best performance. He nails the character head on and proves that only he could have played such character. His transformation from a small former to a lover and then to a fighter is legendary.Pooja Hedge makes a good debut. You will fall for her innocence and grace at the same time. She makes a good pair with Hrithik Roshan too. But we wished to see her more in the film. The supporting cast is OK. As a whole, it's a brilliant movie. Go watch it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An epic disaster of biblical proportions. The epitome of an anachronism.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Same ol story, A simple farmer who saves a beautiful girl and falls in love with her. He then must challenge and fight against overwhelming odds. We come to know that the city is ruled by a tyrant n his son is engaged to the same girl.1)Puzzling why this film is set in the Indus Valley Civilization, given the alarming lack of attention to detail. I will not get much into historical inaccuracies but jus a few laughable inaccuracies. 2)Characters seem to have found razors n scissors. Nicely trimmed sideburns, hair n moustaches. 3)Lead actress is tribal only in her headdress. With her headdress, she looks more like Santanico pandemonium from Dusk till dawn. Her thigh-high slit skirt is straight from the red carpet. 3)Majority of historians agree that females had bangles all the way up their arms and nothing else on bodies. 4)The story is set in 2016 BC, thousands of years prior before the world's first gymnasium was invented. Lead actor is ripped with lean muscles. 5)Now coming to Hrithiks acting. He has been the same in every character he has played in each of his films. Same ol lean muscles, same hair style n same accent. His cheeks shake when he's angry, and his voice becomes ever more pronounced while expressing rage. These are all traits the actor displayed in his debut film, 'Kaho Naa Pyaar Hai', and which remain unchanged 16 years. The same was in Agneepath n Bang bang. 6)Something to laugh about- our hero Hrithik wrestles a rubber crocodile. Badly done. 7)The fights in the colosseum. Wow man. Gladiators in mohenjo daro. Still very badly done. 8)Horses in mohenjo??? This movie is an epic disaster of biblical proportions. Boring, full of clichés. The editin is bad, screenplay is one of the worst, acting was horrible by all except Kabir bedis. The direction is pathetic n very dull n stale cinematography.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mohenjo Daro is visually spectacular, packed with Hrithik's powerful performance.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mohenjo Daro, a spectacular film by Ashutosh Gowarikar, is a fictional take. I did not view this film as the one conveying the facts about Indus Valley Civilization, Mohenjo Daro or Harappa. Throughout the film, I felt that Ashutosh is conveying a story of love, power battles, treachery keeping one of the greatest city of Indus Valley Civilization, Mohenjo Daro, as the pretext. In one of the earlier interviews, Ashutosh had mentioned that his biggest challenge was recreating an era about which very little is known. Very little information is available on how people lived, what they ate, how they felt during those times. He has weaved a love story set in this Ancient India. It may be unfair to judge this film on the basis of historical accuracy or inaccuracy, but it has to be treated as a piece of art depicting the director's imagination and school of thought. Set in 2016 BC, the film begins with Sarman's (Hrithik Roshan) overpowering dangerous crocodile, and killing it. Sarman stays with his Kaka-Kaki (uncle-aunty played) in Amri and they are into indigo farming. He frequently dreams of Unicorn, a beast with a large pointed spiraling horn projecting from its forehead. Whenever he listens to his Kaki humming a particular song, though it sounds familiar to him, he is unable to figure out how and why. He also feels the strong urge to travel to Mohenjo Daro for business. But Kaka-Kaki are always afraid to send him there. Ultimately they pay heed to Sarman's request. Kaka permits him to go with a warning that Mohenjo Daro is full of fake people, treachery, challenges. While doing business there, he must take care of not undervaluing his brand. Kaka also gives him a coin which has the emblem of Unicorn and Sindhu Goddess. Sarman is excited to go to Mohenjo Daro, his friend also accompanies him. Sarman gets fascinated to see Mohenjo Daro, the buildings over there. He also was astonished to see a world other than his, where he found people from different parts of the world coming there for trade, different animals like horse etc. Sarman also feels that he is able to identify with the city, he feels a sense of ownership towards it. He feels as if he knows this city. Very soon he learns that what his Kaka conveyed regarding the land about the bad elements was absolutely true. He wanted to go back, but that is when he encounters a beautiful girl Channi (Pooja Hegde), daughter of the priest (Manish Choudhary). It was instant attraction at the first sight itself. Channi is supposed to be showered with special blessings of Goddess Sindhu. Sarman decides to stay back and continue with the business there. Mohenjo Daro is ruled by Maham (Kabir Bedi). People at Mohenjo Daro are terrified with Maham as well as his son Moonja (Arunoday Singh). Maham does not forgive people who raise their voice against him. The film does share the story of this ruler who is power hungry, gives false hopes of development of the city. His vested interests to rule the city, his greed for gold etc. are also shown. Sarman steals opportunities to meet Channi and love blossoms between them. But yes, challenges begin for Sarman and Channi. Moonja who wants to get married to Channi, can not let Sarman connect to Channi. Sarman has to earn and win Channi's love, for which challenges are thrown in front of him by Maham and Moonja. Maham's wife Laashi (Suhasini Mulay) does warn both father and the son, but they don't even give any ears to her.How the story moves further? What is the connection of Sarman with the City Mohenjo Daro ? What is the secret of his dreams of Unicorn ? Why does the tune hummed by his Kaki seems familiar to him? What all challenges are thrown in front of Sarman by Maham and Moonja ? Does the city accept their newly emerging hero Sarman ? In History, it is written that this city of Mohenjo Daro is believed to have been destroyed by the raging Indus river flooded over. So, in this film, what fate awaits Mohenjo Daro ? Watch the film to know all these. Hrithik Roshan as Sarman has given extremely good performance. Pooja Hegde is looking good on screen. Nitish Bhardwaj as Sarman's Kaka has small screen time. Kabir Bedi and Arunodaya Singh as the antagonist father-son are good. Digant Hazarika as Lothar and Manish Choudhary as Priest have also give good performances. Rest of the cast are also good. Music by AR Rahman is good and fresh to ears. Choreography is kept very simple. Cinematography is awesome. The climax scene is breathtaking. Mohenjo Daro is visually spectacular, packed with Hrithik's powerful performance. This love story set in the pretext of Mohenjo Daro may seem familiar, but kudos to Ashutosh Gowarikar for painting the story on a large canvas.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unbiased - Overall a Good enjoying experience. Respect for great efforts..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can call my review as unbiased as I wished to see some other movie on my birthday but on my wife's call I went to this movie with no expectations and I was pretty speech less seeing the effort and risk taken by Ashutosh and Hritik which will ultimately turn good(I hope).When every other director is only thinking of their comfort zones, surviving by not taking risks and to make money from a typical massala bollywood flick, Ashutosh has gone beyond risk boundaries and comfort zone to present his another hard-work ship. I will not call it as a master piece or must watch or you will miss it. Summary with: 1) It's totally based on our Indus valley(mostly) or aka Harappan civilization(less)- should be more deep and added more knowledgeable scenes. but respectable efforts on groundwork 2)a small Bollywood kinda love story. - should have made it somewhat more involving and different 3)Good use of locations, good actor choices (you will see our Mahabharat Krishan as kaka)- more good locations are available. 4) costumes - Please Please do more work on this. 5)VFX - good efforts. Please start spending gold on this (advice to whole bollywood) 6)music was not at all necessary. 7) action was good - could be betterOverall kudos to Ashutosh and Hrithik for their efforts and I loved it(my personal opinion).. if you go w/o any expectations you will enjoy it.P.S. Please prepare a nice trailer next time.. trailer was totally bakwas</fullReview>

I like Md only for HR; script is weak that is why audiences don't like MD. In Mohenjodaro visuals are great, everything is OK but because of dull script it didn't create effect like PK , 3 Idiots or Baahubali. Hrithik please don't sign loose scripts. I am very sad people don't like MD and I'm fully sad. I didn't sleep at night. Only thinks about MD, 2 years hark work live up to the mark. But I LOVE YOU always Hrithik my big brother. I always feels to live with you like a brother. You are everything to me.We both belongs to each other. I want you to do only content oriented movies because your fans want more from you.

		<shortDescription>One of the worst</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To be frank it was kind of expected after the trailer came out that Mohenjodaro wasn't going to be anything as special as "Lagaan"but still it was an Ashutosh Gowariker movie and possessed hugely talented Hrithik Roshan so I gave it a chance, little did I know what was being offered,believe me it is one of the worst movies ever made in Bollywood.How was this given a green signal and so much of fund is beyond my understanding.It is a colossal failure by Ashutosh Gowariker in every department be it direction, writing, screenplay or set design.Story is so bloody clichéd that watching it unfold is worse than watching paint dry,in fact its so clichéd that even Ashutosh Gowariker knew that there's no point working hard on the screenplay as it's an impossible task to make it interesting. It is basically a story of a young man who dreams of a unicorn and to find answers (kind of) goes to Mohenjodaro where he finds the evil ruler Kabir Bedi, his son and going to be the love of his life Pooja Hegde. More clichés follow, his father was killed by Kabir Bedi,maybe nobody told Ashutosh that Baahubali just released last year. Or may be someone did, story unravels in such a manner as if Ashutosh knew that "what the hell everyone Knows the story already so what's the point of trying to make it remotely interesting" . Hrithik, Hegde love story is half baked where Hrithik instantly falls in love with Hegde and what is done to make her fall? Yup, instead of goons there is horse attacking her so that Hrithik can save her.Can go on and on and on about how bad it is,ignore all the bots who are praising the movie here,ignore this at all cost.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mohenjo Daro is an Above Average historical fictional tale which appeals only in parts.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Movie Review: Mohanjo Daro Ratings: 3.5/5 Genre: Drama/History/RomanceDirector Ashutosh Gowariker is known for his Historical movies like Lagaan and Jodha Akbar. These time He has chosen the historic subject of Mohenjo Daro and Harappa Civilization. but let me clear these is not a biography or real life based story. Its a work of fiction. Will Mohenjo Daro will succeed like other historic movies of Ashutosh or will disappoint on Box Office. Lets analyze...The Movie starts with the era of 2016 BC in the North West region with an introduction of Sarman (Hrithik Roshan) and his fight with giant Crocodile. Sarman has dream to visit Mohenjo Daro, but due to some reasons his uncle and aunt refuses him to go there. One day Sarman's aunt and uncle gives him permission to visit Mohenjo Daro with an identity coin. when sarman reaches to Mohenjo Daro, amongst the many other things, he sees to Chaani (Pooja Hegde), the daughter of a religious pandit. One day, Sarman visits the 'upper city' in search of Chaani. It is here, that Sarman, besides being stunned and witnesses the disparity that prevails under the rule of the evil ruler Maham (Kabir Bedi), who had once been earlier exiled from Harappa. the pandit reveals a secret to Sarman that shocks him. What is the secret that Sarman gets to know ? what is his connection with the city of Mohenjo Daro? what forms the rest of the story.Mohenjo Daro's first half is little bit slow but the movie picks up in second half. Second half is better then first half. Climax could have been better. If we talk about Performances, Its only and only Hrithik Roshan who carries full movie on his shoulders till end. He is excellent as always. Pooja Hegde looks charming but her performance is average. Kiren Bedi is good in evil ruler role.A.R. Rehman's music is strictly OK. Background score is decent. Cinematography is an above average.Overall, Mohenjo Daro is an Above Average historical fictional tale which appeals only in parts. Mohenjo Daro will have to really stand on audience's positive words of mouth against competitor like Rustom.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Average movie with great climax</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>GANGA...the last word of this movie summarises some sense of the platform where all this story happened and relieved to hear that having myself suffer on first half where characters and story showcases mediocre cinema from a reputed film maker except for the promising intro action sequence of crocodile hunt. The climax was one of the awesome pieces of India cinema in line with Bahubali and other popular epics. The idea of boats tied up and saving the villagers with help of cow from floods was fulfilling part. The heroic fights and romance(not all-nevertheless white goat seen by HR the sign of fortune calling is dreamy and touchy)from HR is the downside. ARR music elevates the story. The heroine is beautiful and justifies her part. Kabir Bedi looks and voice gives some dimension to the character and relieves us from&nbsp; repeated style of characters in Indian cinema. The last scene where the city lost in floods showing the monumentals is a classic and touching one. Something was missing to the give 2016 BC feel which is also minus for the film. Story is a big let down especially characters considering a promising premise. Only the climax reveals the directors glimpses of old form. HR casting is sort of miscast but still he does a decent job. On a whole the movie is average but special appreciation for the climax(AGs famous formula which are village based) and also the epic sets and visual effects.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A valiant effort in vain</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all I must applaud Ashutosh Gowariker for being brave to choose odd historical topics which are buried deep in our history books and hardly surfaced when History or National Geography channel decide to make documentaries on them (Like 'Khelein Hum Jee Jaan Sey' was made on brave martyr Surya Sen but it fell flat.)But this time it is about Mohenjo Daro, the Indus valley civilisation which goes 5000 years back, considered one of the earliest civilisation came into existence in earth. So it is sure deserves a better treatment , at least a better presentation.The story is a big let down. A brave and popular village boy everyday dream of the nearby big city Mohenjo Daro and a unicorn hence he travelled to the city only to find he was there before but can't remember how. He became the rebel and mass leader by supporting the city dwellers and opposing the city chief who's an evil man with an murderous son. He also fell in love with the priest daughter who is already betrothed to chief's son. And he gradually come to know he was the son of the earlier chief of the city who was framed by the villain and killed.It became a love story with a revenge saga and later a rescue mission and the whole Indus valley civilisation became just a backdrop.The climax is cinematic and thought provoking, though the end of Mohenjo Daro Harappa civilisation is a matter of much speculation, one can't deny that ancient cities and civilisations were been destroyed by natural calamities mostly. As most of them were grown next to legendary rivers, the city-less inhabitants finding their new life line next to another great bank of river is truly fascinating. In my opinion it doesn't deserve 5/10 and a one time watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'd admit, being a hardcore Hrithik fan, it's hard to write a neutral review. yet I'd be as truthful as I can. Mohenjo-Daro, compared to a typical Bollywood commercial film, stands out as one of the films with an awesome visual experience. Although the history and attempts at verification are still precarious, it is safe to say that attempts at delivering a story from an era when Indian Civilizations were being born, has been pretty successful. Hrithik Roshan and Kabir Bedi did really good jobs at portraying the protagonist and antagonist characters. Pooja Hegde was pretty. The story though - predictable, a little over-cooked, a little clichéd with mild auras of prehistoric humor emanating randomly. Even the dialogues seemed a bit dull. However, keeping in mind that this one is a movie made for Indian audiences, i think 8 out of 10 is well deserved. Well done.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Movie that taught me not to trust the reviews. I was skeptical about the reviews guys. I have to admit that I went with very low expectation to watch this movie. But after seeing good reviews, I did't expected the movie to be this bad. This movie was even worst than i expected. There are hardly any memorable moments in this one. The performances of lead cast were promising but the movie as a whole seemed like a joke. Comparing it to movies like LAAGAN is the insult of historic genre. The dialogue are very poor and most of the time acting is unnatural. VFX is also sub par and seems unreal. A lot better can be done with this budget. I am not comparing it to the Hollywood 'cause there is nothing worth comparing in this movie. This is just a type of movie that takes the audience for granted. The movie is unnecessarily long and doesn't offer anything new to the audience. Believe me a movie lot better than this could be made in 100 crores. There are so many loop holes in the story that the end result is a clumsy mess. The movie had so much potential but it was wasted. The movie might carter to special type of audience. But personally I would NOT RECOMMEND any one to waste their money on this movie. Instead go and watch something like Rustum which is at least better than this one.</fullReview>

All the others have also done a very good job . Its a balanced film , all the components are added , love , fighting , revenge , song (tu hai is soulful) , comedy ... I mean at no point you feel distracted or bored . But obviously if you are trying to compare the facts and figure to the actual Indus Valley Civilization that existed at that time , then u may feel disappointed but no where the director have promised so , it was there in the disclaimer . I mean those who have not watched the movie must be watching it in TV , and at that time you probably feel , should have watched it in theatre ...

Maybe my expectations were too high.SFX was poorly executed, story-line is not new and screenplay was weak.No single line of narrative was developed i.e. Romance, revenge, history - nothing. Cinematography leaves a lot to be deserved. Even thought they did their best but it seems the director wasted a lot talent from the likes of Kabir Bedi and Hritik Roshan - these both are superb actors who would have done an exceptional job but were failed by a weak script and direction.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a movie which requires very strong base of story, as this is very ancient story, no gadgets or no fancy things can be shown for attraction, this movie indeed did it well. Hrithik Roshan acting is very good, 10* to it, Animations are little bit average.but over all good movie. it gives very beautiful flair of originality!!before you watch this movie do not have mindset of comparing this to any other, this is very different attempt made by Indian actors appreciate this. Pooja Hegde acting is really good, not much of role but very glamorous face and lovely lady, should appreciate effort of AR and Ashitosh, thanks</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent movie...perfect imagination and visuals.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hi everyone, its my first review.No words to explain how much I love the movie. I am big fan of Hrithik but I am not blindly following him. This review is totally as per my movie experience and has nothing to do with being Hrithik fan. Reasons you should watch this movie:1) Awesome work &amp; story by Ashutosh Gowarikar2) Action scenes done by Hrithik3) Dance steps (perfectly new steps which you had never seen in any Bollywood movie before)4) Perfect imagination in terms of city, business/trading work, costumes (I guess nobody knows what they wear actually so ignore those people saying modern costumes are used)5) Pooja Hegde did well according to debut film in Bollywood6) Great Music as usual by A. R. Rehman7) Breathtaking scenes with background score in second partI was feeling like came back by time travel from Mohenjo Daro. Hats off to you Ashutosh sir, Hrithik, Pooja and each and every person who is part of this film (epic).Don't waste time in reading so called expert reviews. Just watch it on 70 mm screen and feel the magic of Mohenjo Daro yourself which you wouldn't have experience it on TV.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A total disaster. Not worth watching at the movies.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a huge fan of Ashutosh Gowariker and I love Hrithik Roshan but for a lot of reasons this movie was utter crap. Firstly, the story (plot) is not strong enough. It tries to tell a lot about everything and just fails to impress the audience (in this case, me). Secondly, Pooja Hegde looks great but needs to learn acting. Hrithik and other actors are good. Third and the most important part that ruins the movie watching experience - The Computer effects and animation is low grade and looks funny!I was so disappointed watching this movie! Not sure how the final cut was approved to be released. My suggestion - If the movie was literally based on Mohenjo Daro (the historical site) with good CG, it would have been awesome! There was no need for a love story/ fights huge guys etc.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It was a movie with good score carrying it. Some of the scenes are captivating. You can see the effort that has gone into the movie. Be it with the settings or some details presented about Mohenjodaro. It can be enjoyed in theaters if you go with openness. Pooja was cute. I am not sure if Hrithik needed a better gripping story. I am surprised at the way the reviews were given by critics. Hrithik should do more number of films than one per two years. That way, he can garner support from audience in a better way. That will reflect in his box office numbers. All in all, it is a movie that tries to tell you something about Mohenjodaro in a movie style.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worst historical movie i have ever seen. Same goes for romance too.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think this movie doesn't even deserve 1 star IMO. The history of "mohenjodaro" is not even 1% represented..Instead, a 1970 AD looking set has been shown.. just look at the village, the dress, the colored hair of the lead actor. director's earlier effort lagaan looks much older than this disastrous dud. the movie's romance is a lame effort.. pretty in picture pooja hegde is not dazzling enough. Story, scenes, special effects, action sequences, expensive (are they really?) sets, all of them are a big letdowns. even some of the sequence are baffling and comical.. like the krishh efforts of hrithik in the gladiator style fight and the final sequence of the "DC comic Flash" like scene of folks building a bridge of boats on the mighty sindhu river. funny that hrithik, along with others come to a river based (in the end) and drinks water and declares that this water is safe to drink.. and naming the river as Ganga ! some spectacular special effects is what we gullible folks think of the mohenjaro city at first.. but later we find that there is no proper zoom-in of the aerial city view .. say similar to any hit English movie like lord of the rings.. Finally, i would say people like me will be grossly misled in believing this movie depicts some of the mystery of mohenjo-daro city (like troy,gladiator, 300, titanic or even gods n kings..for heaven's sake) but instead nothing like one. I fail to understand what this director wanted to accomplish with this artificial flick.. romance, history or action? this film offers none.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With Mohenjo Daro, Ashutosh Gowariker sets a whole new benchmark in screwing up history in the worst possible way. I mean, even if I overlook the weird albeit similar to contemporary romance between Hrithik and Pooja(which by the way is a blatantly ripped off concept from Pompeii starring Kit Harington), the fact the Mohenjo Daro was flooded by a ruptured dam and an overflowing river is totally not how historians put it. The city was abandoned in the 19th century BCE due to the decline of the entire Indus Valley Civilization. With cricket in Lagaan, a super model Akbar and now totally altered historical facts - the director continues to be a disappointment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not quite sure why this film has deserved so many unfair reviews this far. I very much hope this changes, as this film is brilliant, which has compelled me to write this review so that audiences across the world can watch it and then mark their own opinion.I absolutely loved Hrithik's acting - he did a sterling job. All the way home, I was simply intrigued to find out more about the Indus Valley civilisation. It's made me want to pick up a book tomorrow and start reading about this fascinating historical era. Please go watch this film. The music is stunning. And the direction is excellent - I've enjoyed all of Ashutosh's directed films. I knew he wouldn't disappoint with this one.Just one word of caution: not for the faint hearted. I'm not a huge fan of violence myself (I can tolerate Game of Thrones!) but this is artistically and tastefully done, which is also important due to the period of time the film is set in. So please please don't let that put you off, trust me, see the film. And let's get the film back on in the main screens of India. Very important for current generation to watch I believe.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I recommend the movie as one time watch because of its alien music, good portrayal of Mohenjo Daro city but warns not to expect much of story.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoiler Alert: It contains information which few people might not want to know if they have decided to watch this movie. Else you can read it freely.With the tag of Jodha Akbar, Swadesh and Lagaan Ashutosh Govarikar is considered a director who stands out of crowd with his focus on minute details of background, costume, dialogues, music and most importantly the story which works as thread connecting all these things. I expected this to be a journey of new world crafted by my one of favorites Ashutosh Govarikar. I have listened to its songs many number of times before I went to watch this movie. I admire the alien touch provided by master of music, most respectful person in Indian Music, Sir A R Rahman. I live with Indian Cinema because I believe it provides you characters you can empathize with, you live your life with these characters and get inspiration to do some heroic thing in your real life. Bhuvan, Mohan Bhragav are the normal characters who inspire you to be somebody. I expected no less from Mohenjo Daro. I have found the first half satisfying to my high expectations. I thought I was roaming in one of the largest settlement of Indian Valley Civilization. The costumes, background, dialogues, music everything giving the alien touch which is required. Hritik looked heroic, though a bit aged for the character Sarman, Pooja Hegde looked fresh and full of energy. It feels story is being set at a very good pace when Sarman is portrayed as a common hero who does not tolerate any injustice in his newfound dream city Mohenjo Daro. he has made friends, succeeded in impressing the girl of his dreams and everything made sense till the interval happens. After that I never felt it was a Ashutosh Govarikar movie. He has adopted a pace which tried to take all characters in not so making sense direction. It reflected the confusion in the mind of director on how to present a loosely thought plot with the characters in hand. Scenes were put in haste to just complete the story and there audience has loosen all the connection with any character developed during first half. I still hoped for a strong end but there it disappointed me most with stupidity on heights while deploying physics to create a bridge of boats. Ashutosh still felt nostalgic on last scene of Swadesh so he tried to pull something similar kind here but he failed it completely. After Physics, comes the time of geography. In the start of movie, it is shown as a settlement in 2016 BC in north west of India. In the end Our protagonist named the part of Sindhu as Ganga which made no sense to me. I still recommend the movie as one time watch because of its alien music, good portrayal of Mohenjo Daro city but warns not to expect much of story.</fullReview>

I watch movie only for these two guys but now I want my money refund. movie is slow and from beginning you know what will happen next. director didn't study history well and made many mistakes. He wanted to make it watchable so put Gladiator fight in it. it was said that it was custom but that was never a custom in India. on that time he made a great dam but in those days it was not possible. cloths, houses all were showing that director didn't do his homework. moreover story was old and had no twist. it was difficult not to get bored. I controlled myself till the end. otherwise I was intended to leave the movie in half. so if you have spare time and money only then watch this movie. Rustom came with this and that is really a great movie. I watched both in same day and will advise to see Rustom if you have choice.Prashant Gupta www.caprashant.in</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is a great effort by Ashutosh Gowarikar and the artists of this movie. Go and watch while you can in a movie hall. Such movies are not made everyday</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For thousands of years Mohennjo Daro and its sister cities that form the Indus Valley Civilization have lain waiting for someone to tell their story. It took Ashutosh Gowarikar, a master storyteller and maker of epic movies like Jodha-Akbar, Swades, and Lagaan to take up this challenge. Dear audience, you will not be disappointed! Taking the disparate elements of the mysterious civilization, he weaves a story that while tying things together in a probable scenario, brings this ancient civilization to life. He uses brilliant artists like Hrithik Roshan, Pooja Hegde, Kabir Bedi, and music maestro A.R. Rahman to accomplish this difficult task. Let's remember the language of Indus civilization is as yet not deciphered and so the secrets of its people remain inaccessible. Ashutosh Gowarikar tells the story of one of the main cities of Indus?Mohenjo Daro?through Sarman and Chaani, two lovers who inhabit the civilization in 2016 BCE and are caught in the machinations of an evil lord, Maham, played by Kabir Bedi. The love story plays innocently along in the web of greed and deceit tying the motifs of the civilization--its trade relations, its diverse citizenry, its impressive public places, its dwellings, its seals, its bead jewelry, its clever toys, and other things of everyday life. Gowarikar filmed the movie in a sprawling 25 acre city he created in Gujarat, so as the actors move from one area to another you feel as if this is how it must have been. Hrithik Roshan as usual has put his heart into the role, he looks credible as an Indigo farmer from Amri and a fighter when thrown into a pit to fight Maham's fighters. Pooja Hegde is like a breath of spring--a fresh, innocent face in the role of Chaani, the city's chosen goddess. Her head-gear is spectacular, but so were the head gears of the women of Indus, those in doubt need to look at the various turbans and hair ornaments the Indus women used to sport. A.R.Rehman's music feels right specially in the title song where traders and citizens of Indus get together to celebrate or in the song when Sarman woos Chaani at a moon-festival ceremony at the Great Bath, picking up the unicorn turban and joining the other dancers. The climax is a scenario that is likely given the climactic conditions of the region and how resourceful the Mohenjo-Daro people were in building things to solve their problems. what is more, the director has offered an answer even to those lost in the horse/no horse debate. Audience in the hall were bursting into applause at various points in the movie when I watched it. This is a huge effort by Ashutosh Gowarikar. Go and appreciate it while you can.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not certainly the best out of Gowariker</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film is based on the Indus Valley Civilization (2016 BC to be exact). Though this film is certainly not the best work of neither Ashutosh Gowariker nor Hrithik Roshan, but still the idea to make a film on this subject is a noble one. One should not forget that very little is known about this civilization till date and imagining a story based on that period is not easy. Though I don't have much knowledge about that period so there is no way I can judge the technicalities but still the makers claim that they have done a huge research on the costumes, people and the city in whole. Full marks granted on that field. Though visual effects could be a little more convincing and original. Some shots might remind you of Gladiator or our own Bahubali. The whole river sequence was slightly "out of proportions". Still we should consider that our industry is still taking baby steps in the V.F.X. domain.But I must say the screenplay is a huge disappointment. There is almost nothing in the story which you could hang on to. An age old tale of a "chosen one" who is destined to do something great. There is as usual a surreal romance across classes of society. The acting part is as loose as the dialogues that are given to them. This film fails on every aspect on which a standard film should excel upon.Now the pros and cons. PROS: 1) A whole new world which is crafted meticulously through imagination and the little things we know about this fantastic civilization.2) Cinematography, Costumes and makeup. They deserve a National Award.3) A.R.Rahman. The music is just perfectly fitting. It narrates the story(in this case even more than the lamely written dialogues).4) To a certain extent Hrithik RoshanThat's it. Now the ugly part. CONS: 1) The Actors (And I am not even talking about the extras). All the actors seemed to be overacting once in a while.2) As I told before, the screenplay. You sometimes don't understand what is happening and why that is happening.3) Pooja Hegde. A poor choice for 'Chaani'. Though she didn't have much to do, as her character was a bit unconvincing, but still she didn't brought anything special to her character from her side.4) Poorly written dialogues. 4) To a certain extent Hrithik Roshan</fullReview>

It is a humble request to all the reviewers not to get biased while reviewing any movie because in that way you are not only doing injustice to the movie but also to the efforts and hard-work of all those who are associated with the project. Coming to the movie, this is yet another feather in the cap of a director who has given Hindi cinemas some marvellous gems such Lagaan, Swades and Jodha Akbar. The movie is splendid and ticks all the right columns whether it is Direction, Acting,Cinematography, Stunts etc. Appreciations for Mr. Ashutosh Gowarikar !! Coming to performances, this is a one man show and the movie truly belongs to Hrithik Roshan. Hrithik as Sarman has done full justice to the role. His action sequence in the intro scene and the combat scene with giants, were breathtaking.He has been well supported by other cast members like Kabir Bedi, Arunodhay Singh, Suhasini Mule etc, though newcomer Pooja Hegde disappoints. Music could have been better considering that it has been given by none other than Mr. A.R Rahman. But over-all a great movie !! Watch it for Hrithik Roshan and Ashutosh Gowarikar !! And yes, watch it in Cinema halls to experience the magic of Mohenjo Daro !!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Mohenjo Daro" was supposed to be a historical movie from which we cold learn a lot about the Mohenjo Daro civilization and the culture of it. But unexpectedly it ends up with a cliché and predictable movie with a average and boring plot which we've seen many times. Ashutosh Gowarikar made 2 wonderful films called "Lagaan" and "Swades". This time he took many plot points from that 2 movies !"Mohenjo Daro" is very much predictable. We've seen this kind of revenge and love story 100 times in Bollywood. Also the dress-up and fashion sense of people in Mohenjo Daro is shown in a very unrealistic manner. Performances of the lead casts was average, nothing to be cheered. Specially the 2 villains were the typical boring Bollywood villains. A.R. Rahman's score is not up to the mark. Also the songs were forced in the plot to entertain the audience but failed. VFX was crap. Some scenes looks like cartoon scenes. As a Hrithik fan, I am disappointed.</fullReview>

Great performance by Hrithik Roshan positively supported by other cast members. Probably Hrithik's best acting performance till date. *Not a flashy movie like Bahuballi.

		<shortDescription>Disappointment of epic proportions</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The only serious problem with period movies in Bollywood is the Bollywoodisation of the movie. It's like there is an invisible filter between the script and the final product which makes the director and the producer underestimate the maturity of the Indian audience. Starting from the trailer to the final product I was predicting it to be a massive disappointment. The only hopes were there because of Hrithik Roshan and Asutosh Gowariker. I heard in so many articles that the movie is going to be epic because Gowariker took many years to first of all, form the script, then, research all about the time and it's culture. Everything is great when people talk about it but when the final product is such a big pile of dump on the face of Indian cinema then all those talks don't even matter. During the time of globalization and people being aware of movies all around the world Bollywood really needs to up their CGI game. People were losing their minds after watching the CGI used in Baahubali(another epic debacle) whereas the CGI used in that movie is worse than the graphics used in Jurassic Park, and that came out in 1993. The CGI used in this is laughably bad. Sometimes I was confused whether this movie is a drama or a parody because some scenes and dialogues are just plain cheesy and laughable.Coming to the acting, Hrithik doesn't bring anything new to the role and that maybe due to the writing of his character. It is funny how an actress like Pooja Hegde got a chance in a movie when there are so many actors and actresses waiting in the line to showcase their talent. Kabir Bedi and Arunoday Singh play extremely clichéd villains. It is sad how writers don't spend time on fleshing out characters.The direction and camera-work is very bland especially the aerial shots. It is not expected from a guy who made Jodhaa Akbar. I think after What's Your Rashee? Gowariker has lost his touch and he is in dire need to consider another angle to make movies or else the audience will forget him just like Ram Gopal Varma or Subash Ghai, who couldn't change with the times. I am a huge fan of Gowariker and Hrithik. If you are too, then I'd suggest you to skip this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>1. Mohenjo Daro has everything in it but Mohenjo Daro itself. Granted they have put some sort of resurrection of that ancient city as the backdrop for this love fable. But beyond that, there's nothing about this lost city. It makes you wonder what on earth was Ashutosh Gowarikar thinking. Why Mohenjo Daro in Pakistan when India itself is brimming ancient places with their own fair share of folklore. And if he was obsessed with Mohenjo Daro to have made a movie about it, then why the heck didn't he talk about that place or civilization in the movie? Just doesn't make sense.2. The cinematography was impressive. Having made a few TVCs, I now realize the hard work that goes into getting each frame right. 3. The animation was a bit untidy, especially the one depicting the expanse of Mohenjo Daro. There was an appreciable gap between the actual set and the animated extension. You could easily make it out. Not good. 4. The climax animation where Mohenjo Daro is swept away by floods was mighty impressive. 5. The movie could have easily been edited and 30 minutes chopped off. It was dragging in the last hour. Normally Hindi flicks are long because of a marathon of 6 to 8 songs. Here we had just two songs, so it was a real drag going through a 3 hour flick with so much dialogue and no songs. 6. The kissing scene could have been handled in a lot more playful way. It seemed that the Pandit's daughter was an expert in kissing. It just didn't look like the first kiss of a virgin. Go back in time and think about your first kiss. Was it picture perfect? No it wasn't. It was awkward with the lips of your partner not getting it perfectly aligned the way they got with Hritik and the new comer , as if they practiced it a hundred times. Sometimes in the midst of fiction and exaggeration, a little bit of realism works as the perfect counter-balance. 7. Hritik Roshan's acting seems to have hit a ceiling in this flick. In order to depict emotion that's supposed to overwhelm him, he shudders like a vibrator that would make a woman have multiple orgasms. Imagine that. If they made Hritik shaped vibrators. Women would fall over each other to get them. He already has dolls shaped like him coming out soon. Might as well introduce vibrators or other sex toys molded after him. Would be an orgasmic delight for the South Asian women.8. To be fair to him, he did show a lot of energy and gusto, which was evident in all the physical aspects of the character. It's just that the versatility in the character depiction wasn't there.9. Kabir Bedi makes a return to the silver screen after a long hiatus and he looks perfect embodiment of evil as aptly depicted in the movie. Only problem is, his acting was below par as well. It just wasn't the sophisticated evil genius we came to love in the decades old and the hugely successful Khoon Bhari Maang, interestingly made by Hritik's father.10. Overall I would give the flick a 6 out of 10 which has more to do with the high production value rather than the story or the acting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Everything wrong about Mohenjo Daro</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the kind of movie why I stopped watching Hindi movies. I was happily enjoying my post workout weekend evening until I picked up a call from one of my friends who pleaded me to come with him and watch this disaster. It's an insult to intelligence. I mean I have seen a lot of bad movies, but this movie is on a different level. Is this directed by the same director who directed the movies like Lagaan and Swades?This film is such a travesty that I hesitate to honor it by calling it a film (a student from one of the slow learners class could have written a much better story), and the acting is so bad that it could almost be mistaken for a spoof. The voice of Hrithik sounds like Rohit of Koi Mil Gaya, and the new comer Pooja Hedge, she should immediately join acting classes.This movie is full of absurd logic and inexplicable acting. At one point, I stopped watching the story and started watching scenes thinking how this movie happened. After a bit, I concluded that this was improvisational film-making. They must have handed the actors random lines, given the effects department random props from bankrupt studios, and a pile of CGI rejects from Baahubali. Then they told them to make a movie on a 5000-year-old civilization.People of Mohenjo Daro may be turning in their graves after hearing what Ashutosh Gorwariker did to their civilization.I compelled to give any ratings.PS: This movie true to its name - Mohen Jo Daro.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mohenjo Daro Review !! Hrithik Roshan Career Best Performance !! Must watch film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film gets thumbs up from Hrithik fans.It's 2016 BC and simple Sarman (Hrithik) from 'hamri Amri gaon' is drawn to the city lights of Mohenjo Daro where he meets Chaani (Pooja), the pretty city mascot. Sarman and Chaani fall in love - but Chaani must marry brutish Munja (Arunoday, convincing as citizen caveman), son of Mohenjo Daro's pradhan Maham (Kabir, adequately oozing greed). While fighting for Chaani, Sarman discovers much more in Mohenjo Daro. Why is its river Sindhu dammed? What is Maham trading with Sumer? Why does Sarman dream of a magical animal? And what will happen to Mohenjo Daro when river and rain combine? Hrithik is fighting fit in Mohenjo Daro - as Sarman, he conveys simplicity and strength, passion and purity with golden-locked ease. Although controlled, his performance shows glimpses of the superstar panache that once had everyone singing, kaha na pyaar hai. But in contrast, Pooja appears drab and Chaani weakly written - in a role that largely features feathers and flashes of leg, an inexpressive Chaani becomes unmemorable and unlike Gowarikar's stronger heroines (think Radha to Jodhaa) whose performances powered his plots. Here, Chaani is another weak pillar in a shaky story that features horses in the Harappan era (widely believed to have arrived later with the Aryans), Maham wearing a helmet evoking Asterix comics, a Gladiator- like fight involving a trishul and several different pronunciations of Sarman's father's name. The vagaries detract from Mohenjo Daro - but its second half rises, details falling into place. One particular storm sequence raises the entire film, its visual effects, pace and power evoking Hollywood classics like The Ten Commandments. Moments of such imagination showcase Ashutosh Gowarikar's ability to travel across time and find stories of humanity resisting forced lagans and lagaans, fighting to survive another eon. Hrithik Roshan-starrer Mohenjo Daro is finally out as is the social media verdict on it. Directed by Ashutosh Gowariker, the period drama marks the Bollywood debut of Pooja Hegde opposite Hrithik. The fans who were waiting to see their Kaho Naa Pyar Hai actor and his performance have only praise for him. Every superstar needs a hit to remain a superstar and if social media is the touchstone to go by, Hrithik has one on his hands. Mohenjo Daro is crucial for Hrithik and its director Ashutosh Gowariker. The film, a period drama, has a number of challenges to meet. Historical inaccuracies may be an issue to reckon with. Going by Mohenjo Daro social media review, the fans have come up with applause for the actor's performance. Many said Hrithik and Mohenjo Daro are both winners while a few were impressed with the entry sequence of Hrithik in the film. "Music &amp; vibrant sets hold the empowering factor amidst the extensively researched script. &#x202a;#&#x200e;HrithikRoshan&#x202c; shines! &#x202a;#&#x200e;MohenJoDaro&#x202c;," read a tweet by Zoran Saher while Prakash Aaraj called the film "awesome". Mohenjo Daro is Hrithik's first release in almost two years. On this the actor said, "I'm curious, not nervous or anxious. I guess because there is enough experience behind me which has taught me a few good things about failure and success. And that true success is actually enjoying your experience doing what you love. Mohenjo Daro is already a victory as I have spent my days well on it." Well it depends how the film will do in its collections but seems to have won hearts for sure. For Hrithik, Mohenjo Daro is already a winner. He believes "success" lies in enjoying doing what you love and in that sense, the Ashutosh Gowariker directorial has been enriching for him.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very delightful movie.. Awesome</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Grand as expected. This movie has straight, simple and often repeated tale of foster parents, mistaken identity, good versus evil - just another story, a mix and match of many such larger than life epics. The director puts in all the hard work and sincerity in making this movie. The intelligence, hard work and efforts are clearly visible. The first half of the movie is casual whereas the second half raises the pace with all the details falling into place. The story, action scenes, set up, visual effects, performances etc. are all brilliantly executed. The movie appears to be way too under rated. Not sure what other viewers were actually expecting from a historical drama - Mohenjo Daro. The movie is not as that thrilling as Lagaan but is definitely entertaining to watch. Worth my money.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I didn't have much expectations from this movie as I thought it was a simple ancient love story..but surprise surprise...this movie has more to offer. The plot was good, however the special effects, action sequences, music and the hard work of the actors deserve special mention. Every single actor beautifully justified their character in their respective roles especially Hrithik, Kabir Bedi and Arunoday Singh. The movie starts with a disclaimer with regards to "archaeological interpretations" of various historians and archaeologists hence the makers of this movie do not guarantee it to be historically accurate which is absolutely fine. However if you have enjoyed watching historically inaccurate but amazing movies like Gladiator, Bahubali etc. you should not have any problems watching this movie either. One thing to mention - this movie is based on a historical civilization so please do expect the old customs and retro habitats. One cannot stop appreciating the director's creativity as the presentation is just superb. Overall this movie is entertaining to watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worst movie ever(even by BollyHood standards</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just finished watching a pirated copy of this anal travesty. Slumdogs cannot create art. They just can't. My blood is boiling, I can imagine someone paying a 150 odd bucks to sit through it. God where does one even begin. Hrithak can't act for *beep* Like he has that one "aura" in every film I've seen of his. The brooding angry man about to burst like a bubble, or the doey eyed love struck dancing moron. Nothing else. This guy should be blacklisted from showing his face to me. But of course an actor can only do what-I-or us directors want them to do. Ashu-tosh "Sir" seems to be aping Star Wars A new hope what with Cambell's Hero Journey template but like 95% of Indians(myself and a few on here I feel excluded) he simply copy pastes the process and commits the cardinal sin of "Indianizing" it. Which means they could've have shot this in the backdrop of 2016 Dharavi and it wouldn't matter. Boy sees girl, falls for her, stuff happens around them, the end. Except it takes 9 Godawful hours(or so it felt) to get to it. Opening scene pretty much sums up the ordeal. Our immortal lad fights the fakest looking alligator ever put on cinema. Seriously folks, right then and there I looked t my friend and we both had to go buy 3 quarters of Old monk. I mean Lake Placid had a better croc and when was that-1997?, heck, Khoon Bhari Maang had a better animal. Couldn't they like work on the CGI one bit? What the hell goes on in India? I mean at the rolling credits of most Hollywood films I see the Indian drones names fly by....They have all the animation studio here and this is what you get? Same thing with Baahubali....terrible, terrible CGI(as opposed to the gorgeous real locations and sets). Don't they have a rough *beep* screening in this town? More IMPORTANTLY don't these c**k sandwiches realize that showing less is more. Nothing inspired from John Carpenter's innumerable films or Jaws. They could have just shown the tip of the alligator, as they usually appear in real life- and made a great scene out of it. The Alli jumped a few metres&#x1f625; Anyho, after killing the reptile he returns home to his village....I'll give them this the practical locations are good. It looks and feels good. There they indulge in the most boring putrid diatribe ever put on screen. Heck, I don't even remember anything of it it was that bad. We meet his obligatory sidekick whose there to explain things and follow Hercules around like a *beep* fat drone. The fat *beep* Hercules has a dream where he seems a Unicorn, but wait....it doesn't look like a horse, more like a pony or sheep(seriously look it up), so its a sheepricorn. It looks at Hercules and now he wants to go to the Holy fable land of Mohen-Jo- Daro. Luke Skywalke, err, I mean Saram(or something similar) decides to go on his Hero's Journey and after some *beep* CGI(really guys the CGI here is terrible, its not even so bad its good). they reach the promised land. What happens next is a daze because I became too drunk. But there's literally nothing happening. Nothing at all. The chick is cute but she cannot act. There is a CGI panning shot from a window to the whole panorama of the city and even on a small screan we couldn't help but cringe, image the terror from the audience POV. There is a arena battle scene lifted(well sort of, if you can even call it an effort) from the Star Wars prequel and Gladiator except in this case our Hero is victorious when it really doesn't seem like it can happen. Not in this Universe or any other. The end is again a cheesefest where some river floods the city(I haven't done a lot of reading but is this true or they just made it up) and it is the fakest sickest bunch of scenes put together. Seriously amateur stuff guys. There are exactly 7 cows(guess they couldn't afford after paying Krish his 40 crore) which are repeated in every scene. One scene where Hercules/Mind reader actually tames 3 horses. They're never seen again. These are just minor quibbles and there are a lot of these. Is this the same guy who directed that legendary masterpiece "What's your rashi" with Hercules clone? That film is a masterpiece compared to this travesty. Don't these guys have script readers, some people who question the product except just Hero worshiping the actor and the director? I hope the film sinks faster than the city did.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Watched Mohenjodaro on Sunday, thought of sharing my experience on a much talked movie... Mohenjodaro is an example of great filmmaking, it is a complete Bollywood movie.. The detailed set design will surely make time travel to that era, the acting was great, n why not when we have class actors like Hrithik, kabir bedi, Pooja Hedge is looking beautiful.. Music by A.R. Rahman was top class.. And the background score will surely give you goosebumps throughout the movie. The choreography was great too.. Action is a bonus treat to the audience, you just can't sit without cheering during action scenes. From the first scene to the last the film has that power to glue its audience.. Coming to the storytelling it is a fiction with facts that too all authentic, people who r saying or randomly criticizing must go through the history before commenting.. It's easy to criticize but hard to create n work on a civilization which is still a mystery.. This movie is a must watch for movie lover or an art lover..</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A stale tale</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>How much we knew about Mohenjo Daro before watching this movie? now I analyze how much do I know about Mohenjo Daro? As we all know from our text books that nothing much is available about this civilization but only the ruins which were discovered around 1920.So it is safe to say that we see an outright fictionalized account of Mohenjo Daro, it is centered in 2016 BC, where farmers from a small village grow indigo and sell it in Mohenjo Daro. Sarman (Hrithik Roshan), a young man, who sees visions of one-horned animal, vows to go to Mohenjo Daro as he ruminates and thinks he has a connection with Mohenjo Daro. His father Durjan (Nithish Bhardwaj) sends him reluctantly, giving an amulet and warns to open it only when in extreme jeopardy. He comes to Mohenjo Daro, got besotted by Chaani (Pooja Hegde) and engulfs himself in the malevolent and evil practices of the king Maham (Kabir Bedi) and his son Moonja (Arunoday Singh). We see large set depicting the old era, where Sarman fights with an artificial Crocodile and it looked atrocious, we are living in the period where we have seen an immaculate versions of CGI technology, people cannot distinguish real or fake. Why can the filmmakers not make use of it? And why are they presenting these stale graphics to the people who have seen Bahubali and some of them just seen The Jungle Book?The screenplay is filled with clichés because once it is a loud love story then a revenge saga then a rescue operation of mankind against a goddamn dam. The characterization is hackneyed as characters were introduced by characters. Here we again loose the leading lady, she has only one expression and could not even do justice to a scene where her father dies. Other actors play their parts flawlessly as everyone were seasoned. However, a sloppy script has never been saved by an ensemble cast. The costume design is appalling; it could have been better because we can see the amount of money thrown into every frame. A.R. Rahmans's music is ordinary and it does not have the melody which we have heard before. Overall, a boredom with cheesy script and clichéd characters. If you are a hardcore Hrithik Roshan fan and want to see one or two good fight sequences, watch it or wait till it airs on one the TV channels.5/10.</fullReview>

The overall presentation was well crafted.The actor and actress has well performed. The first half seems a bit slow, but it builds up the story line and the second half takes the entire pace of the movie.The only negative aspect of the movie I personally found was the animation part. With so much money being invested on the movie, they could have cut down few songs and implemented that budget into the animations similar to the Hollywood movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>AR Rahman's music is the only highlight in the movie. But still an opportunity gone wasted</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mohenjo Daro: Directed by Ashutosh GowarikerWhen the trailer came out, my excitement level started to build up because it did look exciting and thrilling at the same time. I felt that this would be Hrithik Roshan's best performance but after watching this money waster, I was completely wrong. There are so many negatives and one positive in this film. Hrithik Roshan starts off well during 1st half with his performance but after 2nd half, his acting drags on until the climax of the movie. Arunoday Singh is as usual an overrated actor with no class of acting just like for his role.Kabir Bedi needs to retire. His acting was too rough and showed very unnecessary expressions that weren't needed.Direction and Cinematography- Ashutosh Gowariker is a good director but for this movie it's like saying action but with no cameras. I am originally from a country where it is located and comparing to the real Mohenjo Daro, Gowariker's perception on Mohenjo Daro is completely different and unrealistically structured. The camera work and execution were both atrocious, just like the aerial shots they've done for the movie. It looked kind of like 100 drones that were flying in the air. The VFX in the movie is like the reboot of Fantastic Four. Very mediocre and cartoonish just like the crocodile scene in the opening of the movie.Music- The music was the only thing I liked in the movie such as Mohenjo and Tu Hai. Very fresh soundtracks with good beats and great tuning. AR Rahman killed it once again with phenomenal soundtracks this time especially for this movieBut overall, this movie wasted potential and could've been one of the finest movies this year but landed up being a fabricated historic torture fest with poor direction, terrible acting, and terrible storytelling.If you go to the cinema today, watch Rustom instead of this atrocity. Otherwise, watch Suicide Squad although its an average movie but one time watch. Still engaging and entertaining though (Suicide Squad).Ashutosh Gowariker, please try again!!!!!!!!!!</fullReview>

This movie can be finished in half of the time it has taken. Forceful twist in the language and all studio work, its really boring and annoying.This is just like some drama nothing special.Hritik and Ashutosh Gowarikar has lot more potential than used in this movie. Can't expect this from the director of Lagaan &amp; Swades but then he has also given movies like Whats Your Raashi and Khelein Hum Jee Jaan se... So it gets compensated.If this movie becomes a hit, it will be only &amp; only because of Hritik Roshan. Pooja Hegde is used as a show piece only and she has lot to learn about acting. You can definitely go and watch Rustom, and if you have already watched Rustom and planning for Mohenjo Daro, better you watch Bahubali again at home than watching this...!</fullReview>

Now come to the main reason for what I am here to tell you people some points that how this Pakistan destroyed many historical places in Punjab, Sindh and Balochistan. I remember when I was a kid, then the pakistani army attacked our hometown 'Dera Bugti' in Balochistan, next day army came and first destroyed our historical statues, places and told everyone to erase your traditional and cultural stories and forget your legend heroes. They forced our people and within an year at least 90 percent of people left the town.Pakistan always been destroying history because there own history is fake one and they trying to impose their hoax history on everyone living within it, But I get happy when it comes to India. They respect True History.I thank sir Ashutosh Gowariker for creating movies like Mohendo Daro, Lagaan and my all time favorite Swades.</fullReview>

Hopefully I suggests everyone at least to watch the movie and then rate it. After Jodhaa Akbar, filmmaker Ashutosh Gowariker has gone even further back in time for Hrithik's Mohenjo Daro. 'Mohenjo Daro' box office collections: Hrithik Roshan's Mohenjo Daro box office collections minted Rs 8.8 crore on day 1 and and just Rs 9.5 crore on day 2 amounting to total box office collections at Rs 18.37 crore. Mohenjo Daro, which opened on around 2500 screens, was expected to earn around Rs 10 crore on the box office on day one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mohenjo Daro is the perfectly crafted art work by Ashutosh Gowarikar. He has left no stone unturned to give us this masterpiece. We all have read in history about the Haddapa and MohenJo-Daro Civilisation. But to see it live on the big screen was an awesome experience. Coming to Movie, Hrithik as usual was the Show Stopper of the show. Brilliant acting, dancing, dialogues, action-scenes and leadership skills. Its always a pleasure to watch him perform on the screen. Pooja Hegde was a delight, so charming and elegant, you will fall in love with her performance. Kabir Bedi also fits perfect in his dark role. Music: Composed by AR Rahman is soothing to ears. He has given the apt music for this period film which matches with the theme. Direction: Ashutosh is kinda expert in making period films. Lagaan and Jodha-Akbar are the benchmarks set by him and this is the new entry into it. His research work does justice with the movie.This movie shows you what's the outcome when masterpieces from all field work together.This movie will take you to a wonderful journey of our civilization. It will surely give you goosebumps and leave you mesmerized.After watching the movie, you will wish to find out your history book and read again about this civilization.Forget critics, go and watch out and enjoy!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Indian critics doing with MohenJo Daro what Hollywood critics doing with DC universe</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before reviews stated coming, i watched Mohenjo Daro at special public screening in multiplex in Pakistan on Thursday (One day before) worldwide release.When i watched the movie i was so confident that this movie will get praise and good word of mouth, because not only me, every individual in theater enjoyed the movie because of its tremendous cinematic presentation of Indus Valley civilization.Talking about the movie, as a general movie-goer, movie was entertaining and fast paced from start till end, the very first scene was jaw dropping and took audience attention and connected them with lead character 'Hrithik Roshan'aka Sarman.Apart from the visual appearance of world of MohenjoDaro and their people, the movie has a lot of scenes and action sequence which are so aggressive and well placed that audience really feel connected with the story like crocodile sequence, the big arena action packed sequence, the fight with Maham's son and the epic climax.Trust me, if it was labeled as a Hollywood movie, it would have been praised by everyone like they made hit Jurassic world critically and commercially but problem is that Asian audience feel themselves so much intelligent that they cannot even just appreciate the effort of production team which is to entertain people, and criticize illogically.Acting wise i was not expecting so much variation in Hrithik Roshan's character "Sarman", now i realized that this character was only made for Hrithik and he gave his career best performance.Kabir Bedi as Maham was a menacing strong antagonist. He played his part very well. Pooja Hegde gave amazing debut performance and will surely get a lot of offers. The other supporting cast was equally good and did justice to their characters.A.R. Rahman's made award winning soundtrack for the movie, both songs looked so good in movie and background score really raised the bar of each and every big sequence.If you will just read Wikipedia page of MohenJodaro and Indus civilization, your perception will change about inaccuracies.At the end i will request that sadly it's a movie which is being deliberately defamed by critics, like some lobby in Hollywood doing with DC Universe. Go and watch yourself. This film is made for Cinema and i am not saying big words but you will feel that your ticket money spent well in very first visually awesome, action-packed opening sequence.</fullReview>

Its all so refreshing to see this in Hindi cinema.And Hrithik is just brilliant , he is a true Star who blended perfectly into the role of Harman, his on screen chemistry with Pooja is also very natural.Ignore the purist or today's paid critics who fails to find flaws in sling of mediocre so called 300 Cr films, but seeing this one with a big (defective) microscope.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is one of this year's Best Movie due to its visualization. It has full Interaction with each and every person watching it. Even though story lacks a bit of complexity but still it has every covering of a simple and old story narrated in a freshly organized manner. The acting of Hrithik Roshan makes one feel so attached with the surroundings that it becomes some sort of real but imaginary world. The Story Puts out the evil system present in our society which had its roots Before Christ.It encourages one to step up for the right things and Shout out the truth even though you are weak and the other one is powerful. It Proves that unity is strength therefore, its main slogan is shown as it is released on 12 August before 15th August &amp; 14th August for both countries of Sub-continent to feel the pulse of being united and Live our lives with peace &amp; Justice. Wish the movie and everyone who's involved the very best as it is what is needed on the day of independence Or Should I say it is what is needed on every days of our lives Irrespective of Day..</fullReview>

Hrithik delivers career-best performance.I have enjoyed every minute of the movie.What surprised me most is veteran actor Kabir Bedi who has delivered career best performance as a villain.I am going to rate this performance of his at the top in his acting career. He is simply superb as Maham.Arunoday singh has done a decent job as well.Pooja Hegde looked very beautiful in the movie and her acting is okay.Music is something that could have been better. VFX in the climax is mind blowing.Overall movie like Mohenjo daro comes once in a lifetime.Critics be damned you can't afford to miss this movie at any cost.It has blockbuster written all over it.This is Ashutosh Gowariker's best movie till date.Two thumbs up.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I loved the movie, it was completely breathtaking and I don't think there can be another like it. Hats of to Ashutosh for the direction. Music is outstanding, it is incredible!!! Hope it makes it big. I highly recommend viewers to give it a ten and watch it, it will be worth your money. The movie takes you back where life wasn't the same as today and created a connection which makes you relate to the past. It makes history look so good. If life gives you an opportunity Take it and if Ashutosh Gowariker gives you a movie watch it! Watch the movie n send ur reviews. Other than CGI it is the best thing that ever happened after batman10/10 loved it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>#&#x200e;MohenjoDaro&#x202c; is a cinematic brilliance, epic in scale, and visually lavish will not only dazzle you but also amaze you with Asutosh Gowariker's outstanding sense of detailing. The set is no set its #MohenjoDaro recreated, a civilization that history forgot. But there ends its connection as #MohenjoDaro is just s backdrop. The #MohenjoDaro that you see is not the #MohenjoDaro we have zero knowledge about. The #MohenjoDaro is Asutosh Gowariker's #MohenjoDaro. &#x202a;#&#x200e;HrithikRoshan&#x202c; makes me proud as a fan as the man is a poetry on screen. His screen presence simply dazzles. With that sky high potential and talent he makes every character relatable and larger than life. Sarman is adorable, vulnerable,courageous, intelligent, a selfless able leader. Hrithik simply dazzles as Sarman owning it like a boss.Every moment be it crocodile scene,be the horse scene,be it the arena scene &#x202a;#&#x200e;Hrithik&#x202c; was welcomed with Hojo style mittli ki chiriya ki seeti(you'll know it once you watch it). &#x202a;#&#x200e;PoojaHegde&#x202c; is mix of grace,dignity and poise she portrayed Chaani perfectly. Her chemistry with Hrithik is spot on. The reason why Asutosh Gowariker is a genius is also because of the supporting cast. Kabir Bedi as Maham, Arunodoy Singh as Moonja,Diganta Hazarika as Lothar and also the guy who plays Hojo are absolutely brilliant. The VFX is subtle yet powerful.and Rahman's music is just the required cheese in the cake. Shed your historical assumptions and apprehensions and go watch #MohenjoDaro as a good film needs to be celebrated.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really get the point of people throwing rocks ever since the trailer of the movie was released. It is not a popcorn add-on movie. To me, this movie was a double-layer effect. First was the visual drama, for which Hrittik and Pooja Hegde have done a good job. Pooja has shown a candid 'chulbuli' type of character which is good, since we are already familiar(a little too much) in aristocratic composure of lead females in an ancient kingdom. Hrittik has delivered as expected. He always tries his best. That's the best about him. The story progress and narrative is not boring, rather enjoyable. All historical depictions are. And simultaneously runs a magical background of the theme music and apt cinematography. Now I understand why the songs seemed redundant when viewed single. Combined, they create the AR Rahman effect, which stays for quite long. I am yet to recover from the overdose of 'Tum Tak' from Raanjhna, so lovely! For those curious enough about how Harappa and Mohenjo Daro would have looked like, it certainly does give an interesting panorama. But those who want to see Gladiator stunts while relishing Coke, it might be a slugger. In this era of crappy movies coming week after week, Mohenjo Daro could be a refresher. Try it out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Big on scale , lose on depth.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mohenjo Daro is about in the Indus Valley civilization, We studied about this in our history subject. As we know that no one is 100% sure about the scale of the civilization and on what levels the people of that civilization were developed. So the film tries to recreate the imaginative world of Mohenjo Daro. Director has incorporated every detail like streets, fashion, kings, animals, culture and attitude of the people. Gowariker has meticulously incorporated them in this movie.One thing that the director could have avoided is that the movie looks comical despite being a period film. Half way through the film, you will not feel like getting attached to the cinematic experience and the performance from the new actress will make you think that better actress already in the film industry could have done justice to the movie. However the film's appeal lies in the director 's imaginative capabilities. Movie appears like what a big city would look like to someone coming from a village for the first time. The film might definitely not be Ashutosh's best, but you have to give him credit for stimulating the imagination.Film fails to give depth and do justice with script with the acting in the movie especially from the new actress. It's simply pathetic. Movie really does not appear like a mature period film. The script very dull. Serious history lovers may find parts of Mohenjo Daro exciting. Others looking for more will call it 'One time watch movie'.But no bad review will get Hrithik lovers to not watch the movie. If you want a time passing humor movie with the dessert of Greek God looks like Hrithik Roshan who completely makes even boys drool over him. Go watch it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Went to watch this movie with my family with very low expectations. But boy, it was below the low expectations already set! This whole movie insults the intelligence, and is a very poor example of a historic movie.This subject had a lot of potential, but it was thrown away. Nothing inspires in this movie, and I sincerely believe that you should avoid it. It appears to me that the movie would have finished off in 1 hr. So, Mr. Gowarikar would have added more stuff into it, here, and there, and a bit there, and a bit here, and a little more here, and some more there, till it stretched out to fit the entire time. This movie doesn't help you pass time, it actually butchers the time in a gory way. Avoid!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie is a historic disaster!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As this movie is not only based but even named after the real great historic city of Mohenjo Daro, thus it should have done at least some justice with the history which it did not!The film makers have taken advantage of the general ignorance of the people about the historic Mohenjo Daro specifically and that of the Great Indus Valley Civilization in general. And though so much of the culture of that city is known to the historians the movie shows not even a speck of that culture and the director/writer rather decided to 'invent' his own culture for that city and this he 'invented'his own version of history for which history shall never forgive this movie. One author writes about the Indus Valley Civilization "Indus civilization cities were remarkable for their apparent egalitarianism. For example, all houses had access to water and drainage facilities. One gets the impression of a vast middle-class society." This shows that the cast system shown in the movie is again the imagination of the film makers. Since the the director of the movie is a Hindu and Hinduism promotes a strict cast system it must have been a reflection of their own religion. Furthermore how on earth did a river named Ganga(Ganges)got associated with Mohenjo Daro a city miles apart from Ganges with absolutely no association with it whatsoever? Apparently the Indian movie makers were jealous of the fact that Most of the Indus Valley civilization had been at the site which is today part of Pakistan and not India. Furthermore he could not tolerate the fact that the Great City of Mohenjo Daro stands erect in Pakistan as a pride of Pakistani heritage (though the incompetent Pakistani government has yet not done anything to exploit even a hundredth of the tourism potential present at this majestic city full of awe and wonder.) But it was possibly out of the fear that this movie might promote tourism to Pakistan that the movie viciously tries to show that Mohenjo Daro got destroyed by a flood and that like Atlantis it remains under a river. Again I cannot help but laugh at their attempts to affiliate Mohenjo Daro with Ganges. Did they think that the people from all over the world would come to dip in the Ganges to find the remains of Mohenjo Daro there? Would people not just Google up Mohenjo Daro and see that it stands erect in Pakistan to be visited by anyone who wants to see it?It was not only the shameful distortion of history that is despicable but while I see some people praising the music and sound effects of this film, I want to know that why on earth is A.R Rahman called an artists when he cant actually 'create' good music or sound effects.Whenever the face of Maham, the villain of this movie was shown the background sound of Buddhist monks chanting could be heard to supposedly produce a semi-frightening effect. Do they simply have to copy paste the Buddhist Monks? Moreover at many places along the film could be heard exactly the same music as that in 'The Mummy Returns.'This was again simply a copied sound effect to possibly produce in the viewers the feeling of experiencing an ancient phenomenon. I would actually urge the makers of 'The Mummy Returns' to sue the director of this film for this blatant plagiarism!Though the acting of the actor playing Sarman seemed professional. But its foolish to praise Pooja Hedge the leading actress of this film for 'simply looking good.'Her acting skills fall far below satisfactory. Though her role did not even require her to show a lot of acting skills. Lucky her, had her role been a challenging one her poor acting would have been exposed even more openly. All she successfully did in this film was make super innocent expressions to look beautiful and position her lips perfectly for this purpose. If all she can do is look good by opening her eyes wide and positioning her lips to give them a certain look to appear gorgeous then she is better suited for modelling than acting.The story line of this film was more predictable than any I have ever seen in my life. I wish I could give this movie marks in the negatives so I would have given it a -10 for the most mediocre and worthless story. If you can then do show me even a ten year old who is half way through this movie and is not able to tell you how this movie ends.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Real information about a lost city and the life of people yet ravishing detailed ornaments and an outstanding eastern epic that was released one week before Benhur. Cinema color combination much suitable for most Asian Spectators. A 3 D Version would have been superb.History begins in a region commonly believed by modern world in a place culturally misplaced in wrong nation.... but in ancient times such distinctions never existed other than few very greedy tyrants traders and smugglers playing games with the minds of poor working class farmers and citizens. Also depicts the fact that dividing nations and disrupting society only causes havoc rather than change. Enough with my moral history and political incorrect version. Here is the scoop. Great acting by every one in the cast without exception. Unable to find any flaw. Correction a perfect movie.Hero and Heroin a perfect pair. Villain and his son another perfect pair. Kudos to perfect directors. High Five to perfect producers and distributors.Enriching and rekindling movie. The question in the minds of cinema tabloid pandits has been : Could Hrithik match and find a nitch in a role side by side with girl next door like Pooja or .....they may now feel that there totally off with their stereotypes. Finally this is a well done creation. I give an 9 out of 10.</fullReview>

You can see Hrithik has put his heart and soul in every scene of this movie. I went with my wife and friend, we all loved the movie. Though the film did not had a good opening due to all negativity going all around media, I just hope people realize that it is in fact a great movie and walk to theaters. Eventually this movie should gain some collections. All the movie cast has done wonderful acting, Pooja hegde was brilliant and suits very well for her role.

		<shortDescription>Old Story set in Old Time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Right from the beginning of the first look of the film "Mohenjo Daro" it started doing rounds in the mind of historians as well as the audience with its huge sets and some epic battle scenes. But the film turns out to be no better. Set in 2016 B.C. and Indus Valley Civilization, Mohenjo Daro is visually stunning but its story is a big disappointment. Right from the first scene of the film where Sarman (Hrithik Roshan) is in a middle of river with his friends accompanying him and he kills a giant CGI created crocodile, there are dialogues in some distant language and after some minutes all the character starts speaking Hindi. From very first scene audience are left confused with the screenplay. Hrithik stays in a village with his Uncle and Aunt and has a mysterious background. Sarman watches some undefined dreams which makes him want to visit Mohenjo Daro because he fells there is something that is waiting for him and has some connection with the land. His uncle's denial doesn't stop him and after an attempt to swiftly leaving the village leads to uncle turning his decision. Hrithik is accompanied by his childhood friend Hojo (like the Hodor from Game of Thrones). He finds the land been brutally ruled by evil king played by Maman (Kabir Bedi) and his son Moonja played by Arunoday Singh. Sarman falls in love with Chaani played by Pooja Hegde which is termed as 'God's Child' and is daughter of Priest, which leads to love triangle between Chaani, Sarman and Moonja. Hrithik plays his role fantastically, but it doesn't lead to sail the ship. I wished new comer Pooja Hegde had some more screen time as she plays her character very well and does justice to her role. Kabir Bedi is villainous but you also turn into laughter by his costume and over reaction in some scenes. Arunoday Singh plays his role pretty well. At first glance the huge and beautiful set of Mohenjo Daro is a treat to watch it on big screen. The two storey houses, Dirt swept streets, Merchants visits etc. Vision of Director Ashutosh Gowarikar is witnessed by his imagination of clothing styles of the Indus civilization. The story and the screenplay lets one down by love triangle and political rivalries which somehow leads to boredom and also the run time of almost 150 minutes seems too stretchy. With the climax seeming unnecessary as it turns out to be. The epic battle scene of Hrithik with monstrous cannibal is worth watching and is the only scene which one will remember for a long time. The music by legendary composer A.R.Rahman hits the right track and is a delight to see on the big screen. 'Tu Hai' is the best song with well-choreographed dance and delighted effects is a treat for all. Made on the estimated budget of Rs.150 Crore, the film has a great imagination and beautiful shots. But repetitive story line is a downfall with long run time. I wished story, screenplay and direction would have a bit cleverly written, it would have created the magic of earlier Gowarikar released Jodhaa Akbar and Lagaan.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Only time period changes but story remains same, typical routine and beaten one</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Story is so simple, rich girl, poor boy, he has to take revenge of his father death and save the people from evil. Main emphasis of makers was to make this film visually rich without much thinking about what they want to say. Film opening crocodile hunting scene is so amateurish, we have seen lots of amazing VFX work before like in Bahu-Bali. This scene was just to establish protagonist strength but not his wisdom because he assumes that there is just a single crocodile in a river!! And dives with riding crocodile's back deep into river. Screenplay is very much unaffected of era the story belongs. All scenes can easily fit in any time period except costume and locations. Love scenes are just because they have to. There is not a single scene where you can not predict the happening so excitement value is zero. Pre climax fight with two cannibals as they were introduced by the evil, is so fictitious and illogical. Cannibals fight with the male protagonist as they are much interested in showing their fighting strength than hunting a man. It seems that lion is flexing his muscle when he has to prey. Evil gets caught in climax then another extended climax comes as the flood threat by the dam build on river. Initially it was established and said as disadvantage of dam that it has made the villages dry but suddenly it emerges as biggest danger to the main city? Because again makers were relying on showing some lengthy rescue operation. Yes it looks grand but when you are not relating with it then it looks soulless. Performance wise Hritik Roshan is good. Kabir Bedi is fine and rest are just OK. When heroine becomes emotional you feel amused. Hard to believe that music has two stalwarts, A.R.Rehman and Gulzar Sahib.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Movie - Truth revealed to the world !!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had been reading about Harrappa and Mohenjadaaro since my childhood. Picturistic imagination of the civilization had been getting better as I read more books, the description in Indian School text books were the root for this imagination.Later as search for 'truthful history' landed me to read few books, which helped me verify the archaeological evidences of OUR history to the civilization. If the archaeological excavations of the civilization were completed before it could have been altered and presented the completeness would be more perfect. However, even the left our evidences have made the world stun.I thank Ashutosh Gowrikar for taking up such a truthful, soulful and evident subject for making it to a movie. The movie has been made carefully to make sure every audience 'likes' it. Hence the 'masala' in the movie. Story is really good. The creativity team should be awarded Oscar. Language usage and words chosen are amazing (hats- off). Graphical representation is utmost compared to studios. Hrithik Roshan has been international standard actor for our country, he has proved it again. The Mohenjadaaro set looks real (Resembles the text book description). Overall, the movie is great epic making answer to the world of cinema.I am happy that Indian movie makers are now waking up to make movies on our history. In spite of having the 'oldest history' in the world, we were still running behind awesome 'looking' locations of the world with love as main ingredient for our subjects.I have watched the movie with my family, suggested the movie to my family and friends. Looking farward for more meaningful subjects like this from our 'Indian Film Industry' to the 'World'</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Anachronistic Pond Of Clichés. &#x2666; Grade C-</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ashutosh Gowariker has again come up with an interesting theme, but too bad, the execution falls through.Sarman (Roshan) is an inquisitive farmer-cum-merchant who travels to the city of Mohenjo Daro to sell his yields against the wishes of his well-wishers. He is an outspoken and courageous fellow who enters the city, sells his first batch, and immediately falls in love with Chaani (Hegde), a princess of some kind who is widely known in the city to be a ray of hope for the citizens. Chaani reciprocates and Sarman pledges his alliance of love. However, Chaani's hand in marriage has already been given to Moonja (Singh), heir of the crown which is currently held by the dark-eyed, evil Maham (Bedi). Soon Sarman gets embroiled in the city's merchant market and becomes the voice of the poor against Maham and Moonja, the evidently autocratic rulers. His love for Chaani gives him power and helps him avenge a hidden truth and save the entire civilization from an inevitable flood.The story is clichéd, no doubt about it. But, even the arcs that take the running time to about 150 minutes, are muddled with clichés and usualness. What an average viewer would expect from a theme like this is some novel insights into how the civilization worked, its market, its people, its culture. But, all we see is mockery of the civilization; introducing a unicorn and basing your cultural dance on it is not the way to go for a historical film. I personally do not know much about the city other than what my grade X history books taught me, but I was expecting something else - not 21st century AD in the disguise of 21st century BC.The reason I rate this a 5 is because of the action sequences, the production setup, and an average execution. It's very clear that the writers did less-to-no research for this film, or they purposely tried to mix fictional romance into a topic held sacred by so many. Otherwise, it would have been a much interesting watch.Roshan and Bedi perform well among the cast. Hegde should take more acting lessons. Music is not exhilarating and neither is the CGI. That's it; not much to talk about.BOTTOM LINE: Ashutosh Gowariker's Mohenjo Daro is a disappointment; but we were warned, weren't we? Wait for TV premiere.Can be watched with a typical Indian family? YES</fullReview>

I do not want to hurt the humans so... Kabir Bedi was much better when he was younger and even more beautiful in "The Black Corsair"Il corsaro nero(original title)(1976) and "La tigre ? ancora viva: Sandokan alla riscossa!"(1977). Pooja Hegde is pretty. The girls dancing on her side are even sexier. Hrithik Roshan he does what he can do. The music and dances are beautiful. If you got nothing else better to do or you are like me and you want to watch all the movies in the world...

In- fact it looked liked just a plan story in a backdrop of the city MOHENJO DARO. But you know we have to trust the director , and should not judge the movie by its trailer. RIGHT ? . Absolutely wrong. The movie is exactly the product what the trailer shows with a oversimplified and over saturated story-line which provide nothing exciting except some very few light hearted laughing moment , some good dance performances (which i don't know were appropriate or not . Does belly dancing has already been invented in 2016 BC? I don't know about that) and a single GLADIATOR like fight scene which although was nothing exceptional but was OK as compared to rest of the movie. The Beginning of the movie seems too much inspired with BAHUBALI where our hero wants to go to the city called MOHENJO DARO for some reason he doesn't understand himself. Then he meet our female lead. they fall in love , some songs happen , villain is the hurdle , some backstory about why the city feels familiar to our hero , then a number of climaxes happens. Yes you read it right. The movie really test your patience , just when you think , nothing more left to see, the movie extend it to more 15 mins , and then when you feel OK NOW AT LAST ITS FINISHED it extend itself for more 20 MINS. So we actually have not one but 3 climax. Although the last 20mins are good (if only you could ignore the scientific jumps the movie takes about ENGINEERING knowledge one requires to built a Bridge) but it was too late to care. Hritik gave an earnest performance , but was surely not at its best. If you ask me , his character was not so complicated which needs an actor like Hritik to perform. Some newcomer would have been a better choice then i could have justified the silly and childish things his character has been doing in LOVE. Pooja Hedge in his Bollywood debut , surely looked good , but she doesn't promise any exceptional performance in future. Arunoday Singh seems like an extended and period version of his character in MAIN TERA HERO. I hope he must not be typecast in the role of "VILLAINS WHO WANTS TO MARRY HEROINS roles". About Kabir Bedi , i just don't like him as an actor. So i didn't liked him here too. Ashutosh surly is a good director, but he has written a typical Bollywood story this time. Which was difficult to be saved BY Hritik's performance , Rehman's if not brilliant but good music and some good cinematography and production design (although movie looked very much like any Egyptian empire of Hollywood films). There is just nothing to recommend here. Except you are a too much die hard fan of Hritik. Although i must warn you , the person with whom i was watching the film was a FAn too , and his reaction was as same as me. 6.2/10 by ANuP APu KuMaR.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>historic waste</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>the waste movie by the director i have seen in historic movies. i think the director didn't know the the story of mohenjodaro . it is the tale of kids like river land etc. he didn't take the movie as serious . he just want to take a film but he cannot involve in the story totally. i think its waste of watching. but better in reading the comic of mohenjodaro. i never watch this movie again lost of 560/- to me.Another biggest let down was the costume designing we see people wearing perfectly stitched costumes and sandals/slippers. Particularly the heroine who is some holy women wears a crown or some head hat with all plastic lotus and feathers and with perfect eye kajal and lipstick with multiple slit robes. Stitching was an after 4000 BC concept if I am right. Also didn't know Lakme and Loreal were there back in those times to supply cosmetics to the ladies of Mohenja daro. I know this can be over looked as the director's creativity point but the fact of 2016 BC is damn hitting my mind. Let's come to the VFX the first scene of the most touted crocodile fight was so B grade which confirms you the quality of VFX to expect in the movie. Music by ARR could not save either. At one stage in this super lengthy movie, I started searching for any saving factor but I had to return in vain finding none.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worst movie ever of Ashutosh and Hrithik</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mohenjo Daro is a fantasy that has nothing fresh to offer. It banks on the same old brew of love, jealousy and violence, served up in an over-ambitious package that never assumes convincing proportions. Hrithik seem to have forgotten about acting and his punches are not inspiring either. He just sounds like a cartoon when he tries to deliver the punch dialogues. Not sure what has happened to him he is speaking more faster in this movie. Most places you cant even understand what he is trying to say. At the end of the day after watching, it just turns out to be some silly bollywood revenge drama. Mohenjo Daro, which means Mound of the Dead, wasn't the name of the place that this film is set in. It got the moniker only after it was discovered by archaeologists. Which city in the right mind would call itself Mound of the Dead?Well, this film is called Mohenjo Daro and it is really deadening. It's a pile of stale tropes that is unlikely to help us understand India's prehistory any better than we do now.Mohenjo Daro is stuck in the past and not just in terms of its substance. What the film clearly says is that both director Gowariker and Hrithik need to move on and reinvent themselves.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mohenjo Daro&#x202c; is an opportunity missed out to create historic cinematic experience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Historical drama is not Bollywood's forte and it has never been treated seriously. Making a captivating historical drama, despite being fully factually correct, requires a great deal of unlearning and relearning, which Ashutosh Gowariker could not dare to do much for 'Mohenjo Daro'.Making a film on 5000 years old Indus Valley Civilization, with scantly available research data, is a herculean task and it requires great labor and vision to make a compelling story out of it. Gowariker tried its best to deliver in every aspect of the film, but, unfortunately, he could not create a story as big as its characters and setting. He also did not shy away from falling in the trap of traditional Bollywood winning formulas i.e. run-of-the-mill romance.The film is not a failure but the disappointments are too colossal to handle, especially when these come from the maker of films as great as 'Lagaan' and 'Swades'.Hirithik Roshan, however, shines in 'Mohenjo Daro'. He has given one of the memorable performances of his entire career and has single-handily saved the ship from sinking. On the other hand Poja Hedge, the pretty girl with cute smiles, does not have much to deliver. Kabir Bedy, a very big name, could have done better if his character was not written in haste or without giving it shades and depth.The background score of the movie, done by maestro A. R. Rehman, is breathtaking and epic in all senses. But the songs are ridiculously too modern to believe these could have been popular in 2016 BC.The language is hard to understand fully, especially by Urdu speakers, but it sounds very powerful and great. Sindhu Ma (Indus river) takes center stage in the story and a huge thumbs-up for that, as this was one most satisfying experience in the whole film especially for the history lovers.'Mohenjo Daro' is the first of its kind effort of making a film of this scale on the mysterious and very less known part of the human history. Either it succeeds or fails in impressing the audiences, it will be remembered as an effort of taking the road less traveled and telling less known stories.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Historical Disaster or Disaster of Historical movie making</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The so-called historical drama by the well-known director Ashutosh Gowariker(AG) (who brought us Lagan and Jodha Akbar) is a historical disaster or I can call it the disaster of period films making. Even the presence of the Greek God looking Hrithik Roshan couldn't save it falling down to the black hole.The movie had no solid story line it suddenly seemed to be an out an out Love story which turned to a revenge tale and merged to a Water- River- Dam tale. I doubt whether the director did any research on the ruins of real Mohenja Daro. As of the little history I know from my schooling Mohenja Daro is the ancient urban settlements somewhere in the Sindh-Punjab so which is today's Pakistan. The Director's along with the art-director has worked to bring us the overly done building structures, I have to say the furnishings with all minor details making me doubt whether the both technicians forgot that they started the movie stating it was 2016 BC. Another biggest let down was the costume designing we see people wearing perfectly stitched costumes and sandals/slippers. Particularly the heroine who is some holy women wears a crown or some head hat with all plastic lotus and feathers and with perfect eye kajal and lipstick with multiple slit robes. Stitching was an after 4000 BC concept if I am right. Also didn't know Lakme and Loreal were there back in those times to supply cosmetics to the ladies of Mohenja daro. I know this can be over looked as the director's creativity point but the fact of 2016 BC is damn hitting my mind. Let's come to the VFX the first scene of the most touted crocodile fight was so B grade which confirms you the quality of VFX to expect in the movie. Music by ARR could not save either. At one stage in this super lengthy movie, I started searching for any saving factor but I had to return in vain finding none. Casting : Another letdown is the choice of the lead lady who has the least possible expressions when her father dies in the story and also support cast for God sake will you have Arondhay Singh who refuses to go to a gym before confronting Hrithik. Over all seems the Director was sure about the thing that he needed the name Mohenja Daro and that's it then he worked on his own imaginary facts to produce a movie which will boast taking you back 4000 years.Verdict : If you are a core fan of Hrithik Roshan like me go ahead invest your time who needs to see it to believe it ! and for others my sincere advice or warning would be straight to skip it 100%.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Again Hrithik.......Another dumb choice.......And another fully bombed movie...Pathetic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was so curious about a Hrithik movie because the last couple of months the media of Bollywood almost ruined his image and me don't know why Hrithik got involved in this issue. A very cheap heroine (I don't want to pronounce her name) earned some free publicity and Hrithik got nothing. These dumb but interesting issues made me very curious about the film. First I Shocked when I completed watching the trailer. This trailer is one of the most choppy trailers I have ever seen. Very unauthentic and almost all mistakes shown in this(poor CGI, Dialogue writing). Secondly, I shocked for the whole movie..... totally pathetic.Ashutosh and Hrithik's previous venture was Jodha Akbar and that was a fairly good movie (and also a historic movie). But in this time this duo made a very poor film. They called this is a period drama...Really???? Do they know what period drama is? Absolutely over the top about story and script. Unbelievable.Performance wise Hrithik's acting is OK but not great. The newcomer heroine absolutely has done nothing. I don't know what is her name......Kabir Bedi, Arunoday Singh and the rest of the cast were trying but the script didn't give them the chance to do any acting. CGI is very poor and I don't know why the producer spend money to the lead actor? They should spend money on improving the CGI and visual effects. If not then please don't use this type of dumb CGI. The direction is very slow and didn't maintain the fast pace which is required for a period film. Costume design and the makeup is very poor, especially for Hrithik. the story is very predictable and the theme is nothing new. The script and the screenplay are totally misled and not worth quality. the only positive sign is AR Rahman's music. This is encouraged me to give 2 otherwise I wanted to give 1.Go at your own risk and please do not listen to the paid critics reviews.</fullReview>
