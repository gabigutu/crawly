		<shortDescription>Great Movie ! Can't Believe all the Abysmal Reviews</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think some people are expecting WAY too much out of this movie. It's a kids movie which has a lot of appeal for adults. It's one of the more appealing kids movies I've seen in years. It's definitely geared more towards the 8-12 crowd, rather than younger kids' movies (like Despicable Me, which is also great). The language is a bit course at points, but nothing too bad.I read all these horrible reviews and was not looking forward to it, but it was SO entertaining! I was worried that it would be another crappy Adam Sandler movie (I like him, but he has definitely had some real bombs). But he did NOT try to hijack the entire movie like some people suggest. He shared the screen well with the other actors.Sure, Kevin James was a strange choice as president but, again, IT'S A KIDS MOVIE! While some adults can't handle the package delivery guy from King of Queens being president, most of the target audience probably doesn't even know who he is. And he is NOT playing some bumbling doofus like in Mall Cop. He successfully pulls off the role of a president who is stuck in a video game and I cannot imagine anyone else doing a better job.All in all, the movie was very entertaining (better the the Minions movie I took the kids too last month--snore...). How do you NOT enjoy seeing Pacman gobbling up cars and people like dots on the streets of New York City. Each game was parodied just the right amount. I wouldn't have wanted 90 minutes of any one video game, but I think they are successful in giving you just enough of each video game "battle" to keep in interesting and not boring. It's exciting enough for kids that aren't familiar with the old- school games, but gives some nostalgia (and some subtle grown-up humor) to keep the adults entertained.Sure, no one is going to win an Academy Award for this film, but it is funny, entertaining and an enjoyable way to spend an hour and 45 minutes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>pretty good movie to watch with kids</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've been hooked on video games, especially the classic ones, since I played Space Invaders, Pac-Man, Dig Dug, Wizard of Wor, Frogger, Donkey Kong (etc., etc., etc.) at the arcades from the late 70's through mid 80's, and of course on home systems afterwards. My kids have played many of these classic arcade games on MAME and on compilation disks on the Gamecube. We absolutely loved Wreck It Ralph, so when I heard that there was another video game themed movie coming out, I was looking forward to watching it.I wasn't able to get to the theater for the first month, but then it was showing at a local drive-in as the second feature. I went to watch it with my oldest son, who is not quite a teen yet. We were pretty bored by the first feature, which was a failed attempt to reboot yet another 60's TV show. However, Pixels really captured our attention, and we both loved the humor and the video game action.I could have done without the reference to Martha Stewart that they put in there, and I would have liked to see maybe 4 or 5 more classic video games featured. I also would have liked for there to be some form of personal appearance by the alien A.I. in charge. Overall, however, I think it was the most fun my son and I had watching a movie this summer, and we've watched more than a dozen. After we watched it, he came home and played a bunch of the old video games for a few hours. I finally bought Pac Man Championship Edition DX+.It certainly isn't a blockbuster, but with the international box office, it will finish at about 2.5 times its budget, so it will ultimately be another profitable movie. Is it the greatest movie of the year? No, but it would be a good choice for anybody who has played classic arcade games through the mid 80's.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Glorious pixels!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I only give a movie a 10 if it's perfect in some way. The Pixel characters and effects were perfect, and it would have been so easy to get it all wrong. Hint: They were supposed to be blocky, that's what pixels are. Adam Sandler is the last person I ever thought could get a 10 out of me, but then he isn't the star of this movie. The pixels are. I seriously doubt any 80's Arcader gave this movie a bad review because it captures perfectly the beauty, joy, love and excitement of classic arcade games. Not since "Last Starfighter" has a game paid homage to Arcaders and classic games like this, and Adam Sandler is now on my favorite movies list with what I consider to be his most enjoyable movie. The cast did a great job in keeping the characters fun and entertaining and not taking themselves more seriously than was necessary. The haters picked the wrong target this time. Arcaders will treasure this movie for a long time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wasn't sure if we should see this movie or not reading some of the reviews on IMDb. My daughter wanted to see it and nothing else was playing so we went. We enjoyed it so much. It was funny and the 80's songs through out the movie were great. Once in awhile you would hear a little Olaf from Frozen come through seeing the actor who voiced him was in this movie. Adam Sandler was pretty good in this not his goofy self. It is just a fun movie to see.The Pac Man scene was good with the mini coopers. Donkey Kong was great too. The special effects were good. Go see this movie and judge for yourself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ignore The Pretentious &amp; Pompous Film Critics</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm really not quite sure what the film critics were expecting from this film. It's a movie about a video game apocalypse starring Adam Sandler. What in the world were they expecting? Citizen Kane? The Godfather? The problem with these so-called film critics today is that they're impervious to accepting anything at face value. I believe it got such awful review from critics because it starred a lot of big name actors and maybe they expected more substance from them; but you have to look at the source material before making those determinations. This is a tongue-in-cheek slapstick comedy that's meant to entertain people especially those who grew up in the 80's and can relate to the video game evolution nostalgia of that time. If you watch this movie with that mindset, I guarantee you will not be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>* MIGHT CONTAIN SPOILERS (and peanuts) * It had the basic concept we all know of the aliens trying to invade earth in-order to decimate it, and human kind has to come together and rise up to defeat the bad guys.As technology evolves (in our world) - it is a nostalgic feast for the eyes to see all the games you used to love come to life (1987 here). If you didn't realize it by now, LIFE - is - a video game. You play the role of your persona, and set out to conquer the world.All in all, for avid people of nostalgic games (and newbies), get your glasses (3D) on and enter the fun world of games.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very good for its intended audience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is not the sort of movie I would pay money to see, and probably would skip it on TV or other media. I took a young guy with learning difficulties to see this movie.Much to my surprise, I ended up enjoying it too! Usually I can take or leave Adam Sandler, but I loved him in this role. Although the movie doesn't have great appeal to adults, it certainly does have appeal for its intended audience 12 - 15yr olds.I found it thoroughly entertaining, and the young man I took to see it was very engaged.The humor was dry and good, and the visuals were very pleasing on the eye. The storyline was totally ridiculous, but despite that, it worked well! Normally I wouldn't bother rating or reviewing this type of movie, but because I got a pleasant surprise, I thought I'd pass it on.It was entertaining and enjoyable - and that's all that matters! If the theme of the movie appeals, then go and see it, if you aren't sure, then watch it on your streaming choice on a miserable day - it will cheer you up!!! It's a whole lot better than doing yard work!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Easily one of Adam Sandler's best films in recent years</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the mid-90's to early 2000's, Adam Sandler was a much praised comedian with making hit comedies like Happy Gilmore, Billy Madison, The Wedding Singer, Big Daddy, and 50 First Dates, but now he is liked by audiences and hated by critics for making negatively reviewed films under his Happy Madison production company like this film, Blended, Grown Ups, and most infamously Jack and Jill. Recently he has only one praised performance and that is as Dracula in Sony Pictures Animation's 2012 animated comedy, Hotel Transylvania. Now Sandler and Chris Columbus (Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone) team up to make Pixels, a new action comedy where aliens send real life video games like Pac-Man, Centipede, Donkey Kong, and many more. Now, President Will Cooper (played by Kevin James of Paul Blart: Mall Cop), assembles a team of arcade champions to fight off the games the aliens are projecting down. The team consists of Sam Brenner (played by Sandler), Ludlow Lamonsoff (played by Josh Gad of Frozen), and Eddie Plant (played by Peter Dinklage of Elf) to stop the aliens before its game over. Pixels is a great film with an engaging story, great visuals, funny humor, and classic nostalgia galore!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Really guys, for the whole movie I've just waited and waited for the awful part but it really never came. Yeah, it's a bit geek-ish but for all of us born in the era of Commodore it is a great reminder of time when games were a lot simpler but we enjoyed them on a much more basic level. If you think about it, those games didn't really have a story but were insanely fun and addictive. It's like basketball V Halo, both are games but..you know what I mean. Anyway, soundtrack was great, fun parts were not hilarious but did bring smile to my face at moments, acting was fine for the most part, pace also...in a nutshell: I had great fun watching this and that's all you really need to know about it. Forget the ratings and critics. Go watch this and you won't regret it..at least not if you were born in the 80's.</fullReview>

So as i said there were an action and thrill but those never overpowered the Comedy part which thankfully defined the movie itself.As for the cast .. they were all HILARIOUS .. Adam Sandler, Kevin James , Josh Gad and Peter Dinklage they did one hell of amazing job to make such a comedy movie "saying comedy just for those who reviewed it as a bad sci-fi movie" oh relax it is a comedy of funny pixels attacking Earth not star wars.Overall ... i loved it .. and i have no idea why i only now watched instead of a couple months ago. .. so it is recommended and no need for any slightest reason to read the bad reviews.

		<shortDescription>Although there were some upsides, it was mostly downs.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Against the advice and pleadings of my friends, I decided to give this movie a watch. After all, this recipe of movies solely about video games is seldom used, and if executed properly, can be a major success, relating to video gamers from the 80s onwards. However, despite the excellent CGI, which integrated 8 bit video game characters into real life, and the amusing jokes that were subtly placed throughout the film, the plot was sorely missing, character development was little to none, and the sound mixing was horrid. While I may accept this movie as a children's film and they would not worry about the plot holes in the movie, the movie is shown to at least consider an older, more mature audience who would watch this film as it may feature the video games that they grew up playing, and if they hadn't switched their brain off during the viewing of this movie, they would at least notice the ridiculousness of the plot, which even surpasses the absurdity of the possibility of an alien race attacking Earth with 80s video game characters. Made of light particles (?).The movie begins in 1982, and following a not-so-subtle transition, the viewers are suddenly thrown into a world over 30 years into the future, where, without any prior explanation other than a will to achieve great things, Kevin James becomes the President of the United States, and Adam Sandler is given free will to explore the White House, and can attend meetings concerning national security (while uninvited) where he is allowed to insult the heads of the nation and get away without any repercussion... because of his charming personality.Everybody seems okay with the fact that 8 bit video game characters are attacking Earth, killing (pixelating?) presumably thousands of people, if not more, per attack. And that fact does not incite mass panics or riots in major cities around the world.There isn't any indication of time throughout the movie, apart from the 30-year jump. How much time passed between the battles and the next declaration? Days? Weeks? Months? There was sure enough time to organise a ball in the midst of intergalactic war, and for Peter Dinklage to invite Serena Williams.Many things are simply... forgotten throughout the film. The trophy following the battle of London. The character development of many characters. How much do you know about the Wonderkid, despite him playing a major role in the movie?The sound mixing is done terribly. During the final battle against Donkey Kong, We Will Rock You by Queen is dubbed over the dramatic battle music already in place. The same happens throughout the whole film, with Working For The Weekend by Loverboy seemingly placed on top of another battle with no reason I can make out other than the fact that they are the iconic sounds of 80s. The soundtrack comes as an afterthought, with NO correlation or tie-ins with the movie.Minor plot holes I wanted to address here, consolidated to one paragraph: Donkey Kong cannot be defeated in one level, if the aliens are so anal about sticking to the spirit of the game. Wonderkid and Peter Dinklage wouldn't be alive today. Wonderkid's love interest is the only pixelated video game character of all to become... non-pixelated. And love transcends all dimensions once more, because she accepts Wonderkid's love confession and does not lop his head off straightaway.Overall, this movie was amusing in some parts, and thumbs up to the visual department for the excellent CGI work, but I could not overlook the terrible plot and the nil-effort that some of the departments of the filmmakers seems to have put in. 3/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This film should have been made with someone else, not Sandler.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Adam Sandler is so wealthy at this point, he could about anything he wants, very well, but no.This movie should have been made FOR me. I am the target audience, I grew up in the 1980s and 1990s playing these games and I WANTED to love th hell out of this film, but this could be the worst movie of 2015. The video games attacking earth is a great idea, and execution of the game characters themselves is pretty good. The movie fails at its most basic as it is supposed to be a comedy but it's just not funny. Adam Sandler is clearly phoning it in, Kevin James is up to his usual antics, the clumsy fat guy, Josh Gad screams at the top of his lungs in every scene, and even the great Peter Dinklage is not good here, though Dinklage delivers the one laugh worthy moment in the film.I was disappointed when I discovered that Chris Columbus directed the movie, as he is usually really good.This is absolutely a 2/10 production, I'm not a hater, I wanted to love this movie so much, but the terrible execution from script to screen was too poor to even consider this as something that I could recommend in good faith. With a different lead actor/approach, this could have worked in spades, but the complete lack of effort here is the true disappointment. It's as though Adam Sandler didn't even try.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had low expectations for this move. Adam Sandler's films run the gamut and I was afraid this would be one of his more purile offerings.However, the story was well thought out, the humor -- for the most part -- kept within family watching ranges. The idea that aliens would consider our "Space Time Capsule" a challenge of war was hysterical. Bringing back the gamer world champions from that era was even funnier. Peter Dinklage was brilliant, in a creepy convict kind of way!As a children/teens gamer of the 70s and 80s, my husband and I loved this homage to our old stomping grounds, the arcade. This, much like Galaxy Quest, is a tribute to the genre and its fans. Love, love, LOVE it!My child, modern gamer, loved this movie as well. We will watching this movie frequently.

Typical Sandler humour all the way through with a good splash of quality gags (although the cheesy Sandler slapstick does show it's face occasionally). The story: Aliens receive a message from earth including some retro- computer game footage. They take said footage as a declaration of war and.... yeah, you get the idea. Sandler and some of his childhood friends who were/are computer game pro's are drafted in by the government (who else) to fight the threat. Now...

		<shortDescription>A Very Entertaining film with some small issues</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before we walked into the Cinema, I had thought that this could either be the longest almost two hours ever, or that it would be incredibly funny.Let's face it, that sums up most Adam Sandler films... with Little Nicky, Mr Deeds and Anger Management being huge classics, and other films like Click doing a little worse... I had proof to back up that statement.I'll be the first to admit that I am quite a big geek. Having grown up in the tail end of this generation of gaming, I can remember all the games that were included in the film - admittedly I played them from the comfort of mine or my friends living room rather then the Arcades. This film had big bridges to cross....I am happy to say this film caught me off guard. Firstly, the soundtrack. A good soundtrack can make or break a film, and I thought the mix of 1970s/1980s music fitted perfectly with the feel of the film. Hearing hits from Queen and Spandau Ballet whilst watching classic games tear up the modern world seemed like a nice form of justice from the games forgotten by the modern day gamer.The storyline is a little slow and predictable in parts but the funny parts manage to over balance this. Having a linear storyline is also a safe bet, rather then risking the dangerous territory of the flashback. Starting off in 1982 and showing the two main characters developing there skills and the relationships. The directors managed to create the feel of era well, and the cameo appearance Dan Aykroyd as the championship made me chuckle, bearing in mind one of the biggest films of the 1980s was Ghostbusters.Moving onto the modern day and with the slightly interesting twist of the loser best friend being President of the United States allowed for some different comedy opportunities, including attitudes towards the Navy Seals or Secret Service. Admitedly, there are some jokes which meet all the stereotypes of cross Atlantic relations that were a little tedious, but the American self-ripping far outweighed this.The cameo appearance from Sean Bean playing an Officer in the British Army again worked well from his Sharpe days, and I will be the first to admit that I expected him to be pixel-lated faster then you can shout "watch out Sean, it's behind you."Overall, the plot worked well although it was a little slow in parts. Also I felt the end was a little abrupt and rushed. Taking the five or ten extra minutes to round off the story better would have certainly been money well spent.The CGI was, in my opinion, perfect. Creating a clunky version of Packman whilst also getting it to destroy New York with a realistic effect could be very difficult... too far and you'd end up with a misplaced damage sequence from Avengers or Transformers, too pixey and the film would have been stale and flat. The film managed to keep the feeling of the gaming generation well, and the CGI deserves a well earned pat on the back.The only major negative point is that some of the key scenes were in the trailer. The script was already predictable in parts but, as with most big films, too much was given away on the small screen.All in all, a good all round film that is certainly worth a watch, especially for those who like the classic, simpler world of original gaming. Now where did I leave my Atari or Sega Megadrive?Score Plot - 3 out of 5 CGI - 4.5 out of 5 Soundtrack - 4 out of 5 Overall Enjoyment - 4 out of 5</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's a really enjoyable movie. On a traditional (and reassuring) narrative pattern Authors built a film which is, under many aspects, innovative.The idea is funny (credits should be given to French artist Patrick Jean and his 2012 short 'Pixels' for inspiration and further graphic development). The moral message is relaxing (being awkward doesn't mean that you can't be President of the United States, at least as long as you'll stay close to your loser friends). And the visual impact is great.Chris Columbus has the gift of creating entertaining and amazing images (remember the Gryffindor's Quidditch from the first Harry Potter?) and if you'll turn your brain off you'll be nicely amused: it's a kids movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Adam Sandler still has it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay, a movie paying tribute to 80s video games was always going to attract my attention, but to be honest with you I never expected the film to be anywhere near as good, or even as silly, as this one. Actually, when it comes to silliness I probably shouldn't have been at all surprised, especially since we have a movie where the characters from these old video games attack Earth, and any movie in which the major characters are chasing Pacman around New York City in coloured mini coopers is definitely not going to be on the serious list.However, when it comes to silly movies there are those that are just plain silly and you spend the entire movie shaking your head wandering what possessed even the conservative powers that be in Hollywood to come up with such a concept, and then you get classic Adam Sandler. In fact, ever since The Waterboy I simply no longer expected Sandler to come anywhere near the level of the films that launched him to stardom ? yet here we have Pixels and here we have Sandler back to his hilarious best.Yep, that's right ? not only is the film about how characters from 1980s video games invade the Earth, but it is actually really, really funny as well. Okay, at the beginning where we are introduced to a young Sam Brenner who knows how to beat video games by reading the patterns but losing to a dwarf at the world championships and thus being only the second-best video gamer in the world, it seems that it is simply going to be your standard silly movie. However jump to the present where it turns out that Sam Brenner's best friend has become the President of the United States, and they still catch up for a regular chat, you suddenly realise that it is going to be one of those movies and you know that you aren't supposed to take it seriously.This film brought back an awful lot of memories, but then again I suspect that this was the film's main purpose: to remind us children of the 80s of all the fun that we used to have down at the video arcades playing classic games such as Space Invaders, Frogger, and Centipede. Sure, you can still play those games over the internet, but as Sam suggested, games these days simply aren't the same. They don't run on patterns but rather on the principle of trying to stay alive as long as possible (and if that doesn't work then pressing the reset key). In fact they brought back lots of the characters that we remember from the golden days of computer gaming, including Donkey Kong (which was one of the original platform games).I guess I can also relate to Sam somewhat, being a kid who spent as much time as possible trying to beat computer games and then landing up in an ordinary job simply because computer game skills are simply not transferable. Sure, Sam is a computer geek, but his best friend became the President of the United States while he is installing hardware in people's houses. He even displays the geeky tendencies of simply not being able to relate to women in the way that most people are able to relate to them (though a part of that has to do with the silliness of the entire film). Of course, it does run along the standard Hollywood storyline where the protagonist, whom society has passed by, becomes the saviour of the world (and gets the girl in the end).While I don't want to spoil the film, I have to say that I loved the end credits. Once again it brings back memories of the days when computer graphics were incredibly basic ? not the almost life like incarnations of games that you get these days. While it is promoted as a kids movie (particularly with the trailers for the films at the beginning), in many ways this is a film for those of us who spent way to much time pumping quarters into games at the local video arcade, or stuck in front of our Commodore 64s relentlessly trying to get that frog across the road.</fullReview>

I'm not a fan of the actor. But in this case I found him to be at home. The film starts off with a group of young kids playing video games in the arcade. It is then announced at a convention that NASA is to send a Time capsule sorting a thing to Space. However the Aliens misinterpret and start attacking Earth with all they've got. They come in the shape Donkey Kong, Pac - Man etc., All the oldies. All the crew get together to save the world.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brings back fond memories of playing classic arcade games.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pixels revolves around four incredibly talented gaming nerds namely, Brenner(Adam Sandler), Cooper(Kevin James), Eddie(Peter Dinklage) &amp; Ludlow(Josh Gad). When these four guys were kids, they took part in the 1982 National Arcade Championship. The footage from this competition &amp; footage of other popular culture, would be sent to outer space by NASA via a space probe, in hopes of communicating with extraterrestrial lifeforms. Unfortunately, the aliens interpret these messages as a declaration of war. They attack Earth in the form of famous arcade video games like, Pac-Man, Centipede, Donkey Kong etc. Now, it is up to Brenner, Cooper, Eddie &amp; Ludlow along with the help of lieutenant Violet(Michelle Monaghan), to teach the US army how to fend off these alien lifeforms. Together, they must utilize all the knowledge, experience &amp; expertise they have to defeat these classic arcade video games in real life, before they take over the planet. Pixels is an extremely funny &amp; entertaining movie. The special effects of the movie are very unique. CGI has never been portrayed like this on screen, ever before. The makers of the movie have successfully recreated all our favorite video games like Pac-Man, Donkey Kong &amp; the rest. The fact that all the video game characters are made of pixels in real life, just like in their respective games, is amazing. The riot of colors during all the battles against the alien invaders is otherworldly. The set pieces where many famous monuments of the world get destroyed are spectacular. The Pac-Man set piece in New York is one of the highlights of the film. The 3D, puts the viewer right in the middle of the action. Chris Columbus successfully helms another family film. A tiny flaw of the movie is that, given all the never before seen, revolutionary visual effects, they could have made an unforgettable movie. However, the generic script makes this movie, mostly forgettable. Don't get me wrong! This movie is hugely entertaining. But, it could have been so much more. Adam Sandler is great as Brenner. Kevin James is awesome as Cooper. Michelle Monaghan is brilliant as Violet. Peter Dinklage is the highlight of the movie as Eddie. Dinklage's character steals the show, in every scene he's in. I just wish he had more screen time. Josh Gad is hysterical as Ludlow. Matt Lintz is impressive as Matty. Brian Cox &amp; Sean Bean are good as Admiral Porter &amp; Corporal Hill(SAS Officer) respectively. Jane Krakowski is effective as First Lady Jane Cooper. Ashley Benson is smoldering as Lady Lisa. Dennis Akiyama is hilarious in his cameo as Professor Iwatani. The supporting characters are effective. So, get ready to feel nostalgic as you see your favorite video game characters come to life on the big screen. Pixels is super fun for the whole family &amp; is worth a watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Video Game Movie EVER!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I read the reviews, I was about to say to myself, "If the movie is this bad, why watch it?" The I just walked into the video shop and me and my friend wanted to choose the worst movie to see how long we could survive. We took Pixels. That's when I thought to myself, "Man, this is a great movie! Why do the critics have to be so down on it?" Yes, it has some silliness in it but what can we say, this is an Adam Sandler film. Of course it won't be the comedy we most adore. This film is different and deserves a chance on the shelf. When aliens intercept video feeds of classic arcade games and misinterpret them as a declaration of war, they attack Earth, using the games as models. Knowing that he must employ a similar strategy, President Will Cooper (Kevin James) recruits his childhood pal, former video-game champ and home-theater installer Sam Brenner (Adam Sandler), to lead a team of old-school arcade players and a military specialist (Michelle Monaghan) in an all-out battle to save the planet.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a must see movie for all generations , It will appeal to young and old and manages to bridge that gap beautifully. Some people may comment that the acting was lack luster and stale even cheesy, however I believe that was the intent. You'll notice at the starting credits that Sandler's production company "Happy Maddison" was used so you can imagine the type of humour. The story was funny uncomplicated but riddled with little innuendos and subtle jokes that will keep Adults laughing.The Idea that a Computer nerd could have a beer and pretzels friendship with the president of the USA cracked me up and I think a lot of people will enjoy the slapstick tongue in cheek humor used In this film.If you like Happy Gilmore, Billy Madison, here comes the boom. Your sure to love this, and I think even more so when your kids look at you weird because your laughing at something completely above there head.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am still trying to figure out how the critics downed this film with negative review after negative review. I saw it with a group of people and we all thought it was a very good movie. It was much better than I was thinking. It had a good mix of both Humor and action. It is a great movie for the family to see. This is one Of Adam Sandlers better films in the recent years. Pixels is a solid action movie with added humor. This movie is a must see and I assure you that you will not leave the theater unimpressed. So if you are looking for some action plan if on laughing Pixels is by a far the perfect movie to see. You definitely will not be let down by this amazing film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie did not go well in the box office yes, but I don't see how. This movie was by far the best movie I have ever seen. Maybe it's not because of how the movie was, maybe it was because everyone thought it was so good they pirated it instead of watching it in theaters. People are saying that Adam Sandler is finished because of this movie but this movie was amazing and it had a lot of effort put into it. This movie is funny, it has a lot of action, and it is the only movie I've really seen dedicated to gamers. I mean a gamer saving the world? This movie had all the classic arcade games all mashed into a movie and had the protagonist set out to defeat them in life because they do so well on the games. I don't care what anyone says, this movie was awesome.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is my first review and i really had to write it after just coming back from watching Pixels.I'm not going to really talk about the movie, the premise is simple, its just a show about the old arcade games attacking the world. Is it fun? Hell yeah it is. Is it funny? Yep, sure is, is it really really funny? Not really, but are there really really funny shows out there anymore? NopeIs it worth your money? Yes it is. So look here, the show is about ARCADE GAMES ATTACKING THE WORLD, so why take things so seriously? The people who slam this movie are going on and on about acting, the show being not funny, lame jokes, Adam Sandler trying to make moneyPlease..who makes movies not to earn money? Look at yourselves, if you didn't enjoy yourself at this movie, you probably are taking life or yourselves too seriously. The ratings are low because people enjoy arty farty movies too much? Or they are trying to show that they are sophisticated? Movies are supposed to be fun and this one sure is. Looking at the ratings at rotten tomatoes epitomizes the way people think nowadays, all uptight, trying to find a perfect movie and just plain wet blankets.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Finally got round to taking my 4 year old daughter to see this yesterday and I'm so glad we saw it on the big screen. I do get why some people hated this movie but we loved it - for me its a mark of a good movie if my daughter sits through it and then talks about it loads afterwards, especially when there was so much of it that she obviously didn't properly understand. There was no 'boring' bits for either of us and loads of laugh-out-loud moments.My highlight was the small Dan Akroyd cameo near the beginning and I especially loved the scene in the bar a bit later on when Adam Sandler whips out a bottle of Akroyd's crystal head vodka - the best, most subliminal bit of product placement I have ever seen in a movie. I was the only person in the cinema giggling at this!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is simply amazing, I went to see it earlier with my brother and we both thought it was one of the best films we had seen in a long time. The plot itself is genius, whoever wrote it has certainly blown my mind. If you are put off by the fact it contains mild language, don't be, it is rarely used thought out the movie and is scarcely noticeable, there was a young boy who looked about 6 in our row and he was cheering that it was "the best movie ever!" I am twelve and I was not put of by the rude language despite the film being a 12A. It has a great balance of action, romance, jokes and suspense. I thought the animation and graphics were incredible, they really brought the video game characters to life however in some scenes I found it difficult to tell what the attackers were (but that is probably because I am 12) that said I knew what the three main Video games featured were so it didn't ruin the experience at all, only left me curious after the movie. All that said I can actually sum up this move in one sentence, incredibly clever movie filled with action and suspense, couldn't wait to watch it and I wasn't at all disappointed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I kind liked this movie even though reminded me another movie called Ghostbusters by the format they've recorded the "war" between actors and the "enemies". The story is about video game and people from different ages can watch it without any problems on understanding old models and new models of arcades. What is most interesting is the fact the we identify great elements such as love, action, hate, the good guy, the bad guy well sizzled thru the screenplay. One thing that we really need to celebrate during this movie is the Animation and Graphics. The Crew did a great job reconstruction video game actions, scenes and real-life conflicts with the actors. I really I recommend to watch it, I'm sure will have some fun.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went to see Pixels today with my sister (aged 12) and we both thought it was fantastic. I don't understand why people are hating this movie, but it deserves far more than a 5.5 rating. This movie was MUCH better than I expected!This movie brings back the joyful memories of the 80s, featuring very famous classic arcade characters. Except this time, they're all packed into one hilarious, action-packed adventure! There was great comedy throughout this movie which made me laugh a lot. It's perfect for all the family because there is different comedy to suit different age groups, and there is only a small bit of swearing, which younger ones won't exactly recognize (there was a family in the same row as me with a child who looked about four, and he was saying after the film it was the 'Best Movie Ever'). Also, the animation of the pixelated arcade characters is very fluent and very very impressive, which is amazing when combined with the action of the movie. I can't think of anything that disappoints with this movie, however, there are some clear goofs which makes parts of the movie briefly confusing at times. That said, it doesn't really affect this fantastic movie in any way.Please ignore the critics reviews- perhaps they were terrible at the video games and hate to see them again :D? If you're not sure about the film and you think it looks terrible, trust me, it's better than it looks (like the Lego Movie) and it's the perfect treat this summer.</fullReview>

It was great from the beginning to the end. The 80's look at the beginning was awesome, I really remembered me as a kid, trying to play those amazing games. The comedy was nice, easy to understand and funny. I would like to see more games but I really enjoyed the movie. Great actors, fresh characters and nice story line, that increased enjoyment until the end.The CGI was great... the pixels effect was awesome too. Without any doubt I think that the movie is the greatest tribute of all times, specially for people like me who grown up playing this games.</fullReview>

I am not sure if people who did not grow up in the 80's will get it either, possibly? There were a lot of pop-culture references from that era and that made it all the more funny. The cameo's were great and the actors chose to play in the movie were great and great together. I love Adam Sandler, and Peter Dinklage was by far the funniest character in the whole movie.

		<fullReview>*there is a tiny amount of spoiling in this review*I thoroughly enjoyed this film. Like other Sandler films, this one is mostly over-the-top comedy. Nothing particular to note.However, I know it's not supposed to be serious, but there are some things that I wish would be more sensible. Trained soldiers can't even aim and hit a target properly, while a person untrained in the use of arms can just pick up a heavy weapon and nail everything because of "video game experience". Having "cheat codes" for an arcade game when it'd be impossible to even enter any on the console, and being able to even cheat without anyone spotting it when you have a mass audience. Just a few plot holes that you're just expected to go with because it's not a serious story. Otherwise, the film is perfect considering what kind of movie it is.What really made me gave this 10 points is the ending. The short scene after the black out and the animations in the credits were spectacular; very nicely wrapped up.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie isn't a 10, but it doesn't deserve a 5.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After watching the movie, I can understand why people have mixed feelings about it. You can certainly feel the Sandler moments, they were evident from the very beginning and all through the movie, some of them were great, some were kinda "meh" so I get why some people are blaming him. I will say however that I can't see this particular movie working the way it did without anyone other than him, for one very obvious reason; the writing. The movie tries hard to tell a story from a VERY lighthearted perspective and basically far out "would probably never happen" world, that being 2 kids who played video games at a young age, turned out to be the president of the united states, and a TV install guy. The flow of the movie seemed to take the situation of alien invaders VERY lightly, at one point they all went out to drink beers. If this movie was indeed written around the actors, then the whole scenario makes sense, since this is very Sander heavy, but I think considering the scope of the movie and what it could have brought to the table, it leaves audiences feeling a bit unsatisfied. Perhaps extending the movie a bit, and throwing in a few more realistic character developments would have greatly helped draw audiences into the story. I found myself not caring about many of the aspects of the movie, because of the cheesy writing, but I will applaud the CGI that went into this movie, it's absolutely amazing what we are able to do, and they certainly went the extra mile to bring pixels to life. The way of defeating them was certainly unbelievable, and the fact that they were able to figure it out so fast was unbelievable. I think since the aliens were presenting them with the game, they would have also presented them with a tool to defeat them, so the light gun should have came from them, not the military. I also think the girl should have been taken for donkey kong, as it makes more sense. I dunno, there just seems to be odd writing choices through, but much of it I did enjoy regardless, I mean it's still an Adam Sander movie and for some reason we just can't get enough. at LEAST a 7, certainly not a 5.3 the current ratings are giving. This movie is certainly a throwback to kids from that time, so anyone between the ages of 25-35 should appreciate it.</fullReview>

Yes because in cinema hall I found most of the people confused just because they don't know the rules of the games like pacman,etc. They were trying to figure out that why pacman died with a car. So the people who rated down this movie maybe didn't knew about gaming much. But if you are a gamer then must watch this because you can understand whats going. And the movie has lots of comedy parts too as most of the time i was laughing. So its a good movie specially for a gamer to watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Saw the 1:30 3D screening of this movie- don't believe the disrespectful critics who are hypocritical and have no heart for underrated movies like this!! I'll have you know, the audience I was with knew what they came for. They consistently laughed at the comedy, was dazzled by the visual effects, and clapped their hands at certain parts whether a joke or a visual effect was done well. The jokes are hilarious- whether it be visual or verbal. If you see this film, screen the 3D version- you won't be disappointed. A lot of the action and destruction scenes are wonderfully done- CGI or not. Not a lot of "bodily functions" or "raunchy" humor- and when it does crack a gross-out joke, it's actually funny!! Great callbacks to 80s pop culture. Stay for the credits also- it's a very cool pix-elated sequence that sums up the events of the picture. Don't believe the haters who probably don't have a good sense of humor or imagination- go with your friends and/or family, get a bucket of popcorn, relax and enjoy the show!! I have nothing to fault about this film, and I'm not going to feel sorry for that statement.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Future Cult Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was excited for this movie. I knew the critics were going to go hard on it. I knew that most of the so called professional critics weren't even going to see the movie and would trash it based solely on Adam Sandler and Kevin James. I don't blindly hate Adam Sandler like most of the drones nowadays. Sure he had horrible movies in the past few years like Jack and Jill, the Grown Ups movies, and Thats My Boy. But he's had more hit than miss. He's even proved he can be a dramatic actor in his masterful performance in Punch Drunk Love, which I wish he would try again. So seeing the trailers for this really intrigued me. I knew not to expect much substance. I just knew it was going to be a fun comedy action movie. When the movie was finally in theaters my predictions of the unwarranted hateful reviews were spot on. But did that stop me from going to see it? Heck no. I've learned long ago not to trust movie critics most of the time. Sometimes their right. This isn't one of those times. *Plot* I'm sure you already know the basics. The US sends a message containing cultural phenomena such as video games, movies and music out into space in the 80s. Years later the aliens come back having taken the message as an act of war and are attacking the Earth in various countries in the form of classic video games. It's up to the presidents life long best friend, a video game arcade champion from childhood and current home theater installer adult to save the day with help from other video game virtuosos. What unfolds is a series of battles in the form of 'stages' in video games to help save the earth from these aliens. Yes, it's ludicrous. Yes, Adam Sandler is a hero in this movie. Yes, Kevin James is the president. So what? This movie was very funny. I don't know what the critics were talking about this time especially. The jokes weren't flat. I haven't laughed this much at an Adam Sandler movie in years. It was also good. Sure there were some moments that made me roll my eyes, like the whole side plot of romance. Also, Adam Sandler had a few funny lines, but he's not even the real star of this movie. The real stars are the supporting cast and the video game representations which were spot on. Josh Gad was so funny it hurt. Peter Dinklage was painfully hilarious. And as far as Kevin James being president goes, he did a good job at being funny but restrained at the same time. I'm sure most people were assuming he would be the wacky character of Paul Blart in a presidents suit. Wrong. Even the kids who played the young versions of the characters in the beginning did a great job. The theater I was in was full of laughter throughout at least 90% of the movie. Oh and the soundtrack was superb in catching the style of the 80s. The action scenes were intense. The visual effects used to created the classic video game characters were done so perfectly. But again there were action parts that were so over the top that they were lame such as Adam Sandlers character driving in reverse off of a parking garage and shooting the enemy dead before safely landing on a lower buildings roof. But then I remembered 'Why shouldn't I believe that when I'm believing that these video game characters are out and about?'. Exactly, some critics who actually saw the movie took the unbelievable plot too seriously. The low score on many sites surely affected its Box Office. But mark my words, the reviews and comments from people who actually saw the movie and loved it, are in the majority and they will help this movie rebound into the cult classic it's destined to be. Here's an example. When the movie first came out, its score on this website was a meager 4.4/10. Less than two weeks, and the day I'm typing this review the score has risen to 5.5/10. Though not a high score, this does show that the reviews are quickly getting more positive. As the negative scalding reviews are starting to get lost in the crowd of love for this movie. I predict in the future it will reach the mid to high 6/10 territory. Don't let the Sandler haters crowd your judgement. This is meant to be seen on the big screen. Don't take it too seriously. Go take your kids or see it with friends. Especially if you were a kid during the 80s or know other people who were around during that time. This will be a huge blast of fun nostalgia for you and others if so. But even if you don't recognize all the throwbacks in this movie, you will still have a good time! This was probably the best Adam Sandler comedy since Anger Management. But I dare say it's his best and most fun movie altogether. I would love to see a sequel!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is great and definitely worth the trip to the theaters! The special effects are great, the comedians don't disappoint, and the relationships that develop between the characters feel natural and unforced. What's more, those who remember the older games (Donkey Kong, Pac Man, etc.) will love reminiscing on the older style of games, while those who are fans of the newer games will be glad to find the new games play a role, as well. I know that, so far, this movie is getting mixed to negative reviews, but I strongly recommend seeing it yourself before making up your mind about it. The whole theater was laughing and enjoying the movie. I'm glad I spent the money on the theater version.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Old School Nostalgic Fun!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wow, I can't believe so many people are hating this movie just because it has Adam Sandler in it. I think it has the potential to become a cult classic years down the road. The idea of video game aliens coming from outer space to attack us and the only hope to defend mankind are some video game nerds from the 80's who knew what gaming is all about. I'm a Sandler fan, and there were actually times where Josh Gad and Peter Dinklage had funnier lines. This review WILL contain spoilers!In 1982, Sam Brenner and Will Cooper count down the days to when the new video game arcade opens. They enter a video game competition and are up against Eddie Plant, who is a pro at playing Donkey Kong. Meanwhile, NASA sends up a time capsule to outer space with 1980's culture of video games and clips from TV shows as a sign of peace in hopes to make contact with alien life. (This is the Adam Sandler video game version of 'Battleship' 33 years later, Sam Brenner works for a tech company and his best friend, Will is now the President of the United States. The world is soon attacked by video game characters because the aliens took the message the wrong way. They send down Pac-Man, Donkey Kong, Centipede, Mario, Space Invaders, Arkanoid and Tetris. Sam, Will, Eddie, and conspiracy theorist Ludlow must team up and stop the video game aliens from destroying and pixelating the world. This is a cheesy fun ride. Don't take it too seriously and you might enjoy it. I would definitely recommend PIXELS!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Feeling the need to beef up the score on this movie. I enjoyed it! Yes, it was ridiculous and stupid but I enjoyed it. Paul Blart, The Mall Cop is President of the United States, and Happy Gilmore, the voice of Olaf the Snowman and the children's author that Will Ferrell calls "Elf" are going to attempt to save the world from alien invaders using 1980's video games. I was surprised that my ten and seven year old girls liked it too. However, they had many questions about the references to the '80's pop stars and icons and many of the arcade games meant nothing to them. If you spent any time in the arcades in the early eighties then I am pretty sure you will appreciate this movie!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I sort of knew when I read the first few reviews that this was going to be a good movie. My roommate and I decided to go see it and he was really not interested. Kept commenting that anything under 7.0 is pretty much a waste. After seeing Ant-Man (which is a 7+), I quickly told him to reconsider.We loved it. The story was predictable but really not as much as I thought. The games and action was great. I'm really tired of seeing blood and gore in films. This is family friendly! Adam has his expected humor and while it's nothing to cry about, it's funny. Definitely don't feel like I wasted my time with this. 10 out of 10 to balance things out, but definitely an 8.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Took my family to see this movie ages 6 to 14 and everyone had fun and loved it. I don't understand the hate coming from the critics about this movie. Did Adam Sandler steal their lollypop or something? I mean the movie is not the greatest film of all time but it was light and fun and had almost no negatives. Why such hatred. I don't get it, but remember that critics like these said that Star Wars would flop and the ET wouldn't make a dime. Someone brought up Siskel and Ebert and I laugh because they hated both ET and Star Wars. Ignore the critics who hate everything and have no fun in life. Go see this movie don't take it seriously and have some fun!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A 5.5 on IMDb. Really? This movie was not bad! It was funny, action packed, and just all out fun.The idea and the storyline of this movie was very good. It was very creative and it brought back memories of older games such as PAC-MAN, Galaga, and Donkey Kong. The CGI for all the animated game characters was awesome. The cartoony animation was absolutely great and made the characters fit in well with the real world.The comedy was hilarious! I found myself laughing very hard at times and it was just great, classic Happy Madison humor. Part of this was because of the acting which was great by the way. Everyone keeps saying that Adam Sandler is not funny anymore but I disagree. He still was funny at times to me and I thought he did good acting. Kevin James as the president was hysterical. Michelle Monaghan did great. But the two who were just hilarious and almost made you cry because they were so funny was Peter Dinklage and Josh Gad. They were so funny and the stuff they said and did was totally laugh out loud funny.Surprisingly, the action in this movie was really good. The PAC-MAN car chase, the Donkey Kong battle, and the video games attacking the city was great action and there were some cool new stunts I have never seen before and that was nice to see in a comedy film.If you love the old time video games, Happy Madison, good, laugh out loud comedy, and some cool and comical action then you will love this movie. Sit back, don't take it too seriously, and enjoy this fun film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I enjoyed it, Pixels is much better than people say. It has some really funny parts, and if you grew up in the 80's and played some old games you will like this I am betting. Of course there are some silly parts, but that's how all Adam Sandler movies are. It reminded me a bit of Billy Madison or Happy Gilmore. It was fun to watch.Ignore the reviews from critics, the SJW's these days will find anything to complain about and they did with this movie too. They want everything, whether it be a movie, video game, or comic book to cater to them. Anything they find offensive immediately they claim to be insulting and they will overlook anything good about the movie just so they can talk negatively about it. Never listen to an SJW when it comes to reviews, they are awful critics.Watch a movie, and judge it for yourself.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of those movies you have to expect the same old punch lines from Adam Sandler.If you can get past that the movie itself was cool. I loved the visual effects for the old school gamer out there. The constant pokes at the gun users that have no clue how to shoot was funny. This is what we call noobs or scrubs in our world.Pixel is a semi funny movie with great animations being displayed. I enjoyed it, but probably only watch once or twice. If you love eye candy from graphics or animation this is worth the viewing.I gave this movie 6 stars because the acting from Adam Sandler is pretty much the same as the water boy, bland.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Fun Movie That Does Not Deserve the Bad Reviews!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After seeing 'Pixels' several times now thanks to Starz, I can't help but wonder why the movie was panned so badly by critics and fans alike during its theatrical run? It's an enjoyable film with funny characters, tight direction by family film veteran Chris Columbus, a decent script, and good acting by everyone involved. My only guess is that the backlash is due to one factor and one factor only - Adam Sandler and his Happy Madison crew were involved in the project. Not that Sandler was bad in the film, he was as good as he ever was. I think it's more of a bias built on a foundation of bad/sub-par movies that Sandler has released in recent years (i.e. "Grown Up's 2", "Just Go With It", "Jack and Jill", "That's My Boy" etc.), but I think that people are letting their resentment of Sandler cloud their judgement on this film which is a delightful family film rooted in a ton of 80's arcade game nostalgia. The film and everyone involved don't deserve that and if people would just ease up on their biases a bit then they'd see that the movie is a fun fantasy romp with likable characters and an interesting premise developed from a French short film of the same name. Sure the story is far-fetched, but it was a fun ride and is a movie that is a great Saturday night flick with the kids. Not to go into too much detail, but the premise of the story is simple - It is 1982 and Sam Brenner (Sandler) is a teenage arcade game whiz who is talked into enter the World Video Game Championships by his friend Will Cooper (James). During the championships, Sam and Will meet another contestant, an eccentric young kid named Ludlow Lamansoff (Gad). In the finals Sam has to face-off with Eddie "Fireblaster" Plant (Dinklage), another teenage arcade game whiz. Sam eventually loses to Plant and it haunts him for the rest of his life. In the current day, Sam has grown up to become a Audio/Video installer and Will Cooper has become the President of the United States. After a mysterious attack it is discovered that a video of the 1982 World Championships was sent into outer space on a probe. The probe was intercepted by an alien civilization and the games on the video were misinterpreted as a threat by the aliens who proceed to develop weaponry similar tot he games to battle Earth in winner-take-all battle. Once it is discovered that the aliens are using old arcade games to fight us, President Cooper employs Sam, Ludlow, and Eddie to help use their old-school gamer skills to team up and stave off the attackers. Again, this a fun movie that really ignites old-school arcade/video game nostalgia and does a great job of interweaving old games into the modern time-line of the film. I highly recommend it to anyone.</fullReview>

But I loved the music of the eighties like Olivia Newton- John,Duran Duran,Spandau Ballet,Michael Jackson,Lionel Richie,Huey Lewis and the News,Robert Palmer,Debbie Gibson,George Michael and Rick Astley etc. And I loved my Atari 600XL computer. My personal favorite video games were of course Pac-Man,Q-Bert,Space Invaders,Donkey Kong,Frogger,Pole Position and my personal favorites were Star Raiders were you fly your ship across the galaxy and wipe out enemy ships in other sectors and Star Wars the Arcade Game. I really liked Adam Sandler as well as Kevin James and Josh Gad and Michelle Monaghan in this movie,and I loved the part where Pac-Man eats his creator's arm off.

If you don't like Adam sandler or his friends from happy Maddison don't watch the films, you all know what you are going to get. They are not here to claim Oscars, it's all just good fun. I don't like some actors so I don't watch their films and give an unfair rating of someone I have already pre judged. It's totally unfair to watch a film you already know you won't be into. I hate soaps on TV but don't slag them off to others who like them. Please be honest to IMDb and don't ruin it for others.

		<shortDescription>Silly Tribute to the Classic Arcade Games from the 80's</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1982, the boy Sam Brenner disputes the video game arcade championship and loses the title to Eddie "The Fire Blaster" Plant playing Donkey Kong. This defeat affects his life and in the present days, Brenner (Adam Sandler) is an installer of audio and video systems. His best friend Will Cooper (Kevin James) is the President of the United States. Brenner is installing a system at the house of Violet Van Patten (Michelle Monaghan), who has just divorced, for her son Matty (Matt Lintz). Out of the blue, he is summoned to the White House and he finds that Violet is a military that works there. Soon he learns that an American base was attacked by aliens. When he meets his friend Ludlow "The Wonder Kid" Lamansoff (Josh Gad), he discovers that the aliens have found a time capsule sent by the US Government to the space with a videocassette of video game and understood that it was a declaration of war. The aliens broadcast a challenge to Earth to play and win a video game against them; otherwise Earth will be destroyed. Now the last hope on Earth is Brenner, Cooper, Ludlow, Violet and Eddie (Peter Dinklage)."Pixels" is a silly tribute to the classic arcade games from the 80's. Despite the great cast and awesome special effects, but the story is too silly. My vote is four.Title (Brazil): "Pixels"</fullReview>

And this is coming from a 40 (ish!) year old woman who has never played a single video game! My children wanted to see it in the theatre, but I thought it was an animated film, I must have been confused with Pixar Studios. I missed the trailer as well for it.

I mean the whole premise of aliens seeing the games as a threat and sending them back to challenge Earth to a death match - LOL! Even the love interest in the story is a ham-up.This is a light comedy that gets the laughs and delivers good entertainment value, it does not take itself too seriously and neither should you.I have given this movie what it deserves - it is not a 10 but it certainly is not a 5 or lower that it's average would tell you</fullReview>

I rolled my eyes and sucked my teeth like ten times during the movie at some corny scenes, like when the Josh Gad character tried to kiss Brenner on the lips, or when Serena and Martha Stewart waved Eddie up at the end from the White House window. But it was an easily understandable comedy. Lots of reviews said there was no premise to the story, but there was. Lots of stories from the 80's and 90's were conjured from the idea that the capsule of human info sent from earth to space would be misinterpreted by aliens from space and they would decide to destroy earth. It has been used all the time as punchlines because back in the old days it was the biggest risk when the capsule was first sent to space. I think even a star trek movie was based on the same concept(look it up,not sure about that one). Anyway, it was a good movie.Wouldn't go up for an Oscar, but good for a lot of laughs, I liked it.</fullReview>

It was hilarious, it had great music, great effects and awesome battles if you loved the 80's and love action/comedy films you will love it if you hate Adam Sandler and you think the humor in this film is bad and more for Grown ups instead of young kids then i suggest you to skip it.</fullReview>

There were some funny lines at the beginning and some of the video game gags did go a little well. Adam Sandler, Kevin James, Josh Gad, Peter Dinklage, and Michelle Monaghan did well with their roles. When I saw the arcade and all those video games during the 1982 sequence, part of me felt some nostalgia for the times I spent with my brother and his friend playing those games at that kind of place. About the ending sequence taking place one year later: lame. Though really, this was pretty enjoyable so on that note, Pixels is worth a look.</fullReview>

I literally had to stop the movie playing on my seatback monitor, because I was laughing so hard I was crying. Twice. It was incredible.I mean, this is not an intellectual exercise -- it's an Adam Sandler comedy. But for what it is, it's a gem.This could also be a kids movie.

Adam Sandler was really amazing in this movie. He is somehow like a superhero. The movie is really entertaining with such great effects. There are some silly parts but it is pretty hilarious to me like a human falls in love with the video games' character. It keeps pushing me towards the end of the movie without disappointing me. The end of the movie was really what I expected. It was really cool but before that my heart was pounding like an alarm clock. Finally, I love how this film made my heart goes crazy about it.

		<fullReview>Pixels, based on the 80s arcade games, is an American movie that was just released this year 2015, and its protagonists Brenner (Adam Sandler) and Cooper (Kevin James) and also the presence of Peter Dinklage as Eddie, video game player. It is directed by Chris Columbus, who directed the first film in the Harry Potter saga. The story begins with Brenner missing out on one of the games, years later, he is a repairer of games that he spoke with his friend Cooper childhood, currently the US president, and when he went to work he met Violet who would soon have a relationship intimate. The such pixels, created by the aliens, invading the world and it created them did not like the message received by the US government and who knew it was Ludlow who gave the videotape to Brenner and Cooper and where with the help of own Violet, who is scientist, and her team, create weapons to destroy the pixels and it really is a game that has rules. This film hit the proposal that it was a comedy and was so well structured story, arrested me from beginning to end but Adam Sandler did not grace the film still was and all the cast world, my score is 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I'm an old school gamer and this was a perfect tribute</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a kid I was one of the gamers who made the local news. I got to the end of Pac-Man. I could play forever on Robotron: 2084. To this day I have MAME always loaded on a PC and I go through the old games. I do love Skyrim and Super Hexagon, so as a gamer, I'm complete. I read all the bad reviews on Pixels, but I just had to see it for myself. I was pleasantly surprised.I never cared for Adam Sandler's other films, having only sit through Happy Gilmore. I couldn't stomach much else of his. But maybe he gets better as he ages, or I get more tolerant as I do. Either way, I couldn't find a single bad thing about this film. If you're an old school gamer, this movie is a great treat.The footage of the old arcade games in the beginning - the games didn't have video screen artifacts. Basically, they weren't pixellated as they were supposed to be. I forgave that. I mean, who cares, really? That's about the only inconsistency I could find, and it was trivial.The film was entertaining from beginning to end. Especially nice was during the end credits. They replay the entire movie in 8-bit format. It was easy to see that Pixels was a labor of love, and I guess you have to be an old school gamer to appreciate it all. This is a classic, and I'm happy to be alive to have gotten to see this. I can imagine what it's like to be Stan Lee, and see all your superhero creations come to life as some of the most successful films of all time. To see the 80's arcade culture brought to life and memorialized in Pixels, it's a similar feeling, one that all gamers can share.I highly recommend this film. I give it a perfect score. Well deserved.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What's with this pompous need for character development when you've got Ghostbusters?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In perusing the reviews for this movie, the usual Adam Sandler haters seem to be out in force, demanding that he give them their full measure of character development.Well, in a word, they are wrong.The other big word in the reviews seems to be something called "FUN".This is a fun movie, with no pretenses and no pomposity, just a basic plot - our heroes save the world in THEIR way, and the hero gets the girl. Adam Sandler plays his usual humble character who starts out as a loser and ends up with impressing the girl and doing the seeming impossible. He came up with a novel scenario and meets the fun needs of the viewers. At least the ones who didn't start out the movie intending to hate it.MY OWN TAKE ON IT was that it was an update of Ghostbusters, and even included ghosts of a sort (PACMAN ghosts) in the process. It was pretty much Bill Murray and company battling surreal enemies, engaging in witty repartee with the heroine, and using similar pasted-together high-tech devices to battle the enemy with. I was half expecting "Don't cross the streams!" somewhere along the line. Or "...Cats and dogs living together".I thought it was a nice romp.I DO wonder if anyone panned Ghostbusters as much when it came out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I admit I thought this film would be corny. The only reason I went to watch it was because my son and his friends wanted to see it. I had low expectations.However, I was totally wrong. It's a very funny film! How the actors completed their scenes without giggling, I don't know.My group ranged from age 10 to age 65. All of us were laughing out loud. The banter between characters was brilliantly timed.The special effects were bright and cheerful. You do not have to know anything about arcade video games to enjoy them.It's well worth going to watch. A far better summer film than the much hyped Inside-Out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am by no means an Adam Sandler fan! But this movie was very, very good. I watched it with my kids and we had a BLAST!!! Maybe it's because I remember arcades, and they have played a few old school games... But we thought it was totally tubular XD. We were actually pleasantly surprised by this movie. I've even heard that people are blowing it off simply because of Adam. Look like I said, not a big fan. But the story line was promising, and he has had a few good ones... The one thing I will say about his movies is that I would love to have most of their soundtracks. So don't be so quick to judge.

		<fullReview>Now I don't get why people keep saying this movie is a load of crap. Just because it had Adam Sandler in it you guys hated it. Anyways, this movie was a fun movie. It has such an amazing plot and the special affects were the best I've ever seen. I just think Adam could've tried harder. He is obviously capable of amazing things its just that he needs to try more. Id say it was worth my time and money, its concept was freaking amazing! If everyone tried their complete hardest, this movie would have been a Smash Hit. In my opinion Adam is a very funny guy and I just love that he wont quit making movies. I just loved how pacman looked and the whole idea of the small cars as the ghosts, it was just straight genius</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>good movie and concept</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I grew up on 80s classic arcade games, and that was one of the main reasons I wanted to see this movie. That and the interesting concept. I enjoyed the idea of a movie where kids would win a video game tournament, and they would send those games and other stuff into space in hopes that aliens would find it;the aliens did and misinterpret as a declaration of war and retaliate with those games! Adam Sandler and Kevin James were the perfect choices for the leads. Especially Adam Sandler. I liked the choices of the "battle games" with Gallaga, Centipede, Pac Man, and Donkey Kong, and cameos by Frogger, QBert, and others. My favorite scenes include Kevin James in the school (reminiscent of George W Bush!), the battle scenes, and the scene in the prison. Anyone nostalgic about these games will enjoy this movie. It was hilarious! ** 1/2 out of ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I read some critics about the movie and hey it is Adam Sandler, that movie is not going to win an Oscar, and he makes that kind of movies only for entertainment. This movie makes fun for everything related to 80's and how we can miss that age and the idea to mix those feelings were really great. I grew up using Arcade Machines (I'm from 90's generation) but I played those video games. I laughed a lot, and the other people at the cinema did it as well. I gave it 9 because I had a good night laughing, and the last part (Spoiler): with Peter Dinklage looked at Serena and Martha Stewart was hilarious, that Look of degenerated he did was awesome.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is really really bad, but the movie studio is paying me to write positive reviews! It's a very popular scam, especially when the film is this bad. If there aren't any positive reviews on IMDb, then the movie will lose millions of dollars and no one wants that! So here's my positive review. All I have to do is select 9/10 stars and I get paid 40 cents. I'm going to create a new fake account so I can vote again! So in closing, do not watch this movie, it's absolutely terrible. If you want, you can become a positive review writer just like me! Sony Pictures has to pay lots of people to write positive reviews because the critics and actual movie goers sure aren't! They have a long history of making terrible movies, and this one is no exception.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The only reason why people gave this movie such a bad review is because they wanted it to be longer but they need to take a chill pill because this movie took me back to my childhood and brought me to tears. The only thing is it's rated PG so be aware when you take small children to see this movie but my brother enjoyed it so it might not be that bad to some kids. But this doesn't deserve 5/10 stars that is just ridiculous give the creators some credit for this would you I mean come on now you guys need a more happier life I am just saying you know. But you should go see this movie yourself and try prove me wrong and if you do well then that's your opinion but it will not change my opinion on what I really think about this movie. I know this movie isn't good enough to be a sequel though because this was just a one time thing to show old video games coming to life to take over the world.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun film with a lot of nostalgia</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Using the basic 'alien invasion' concept this film has it all, with a nostalgic twist for the arcade games generation. A bit simple, yes, but still a fist full of entertainment.The actors do a great job, the fact that Mr.Iwatani (creator of Puck Man) participates as a hardware tech in the arcade at the beginning, is thrilling. The CGI is very well made and representation of the game characters was flawless in spite of that several famous elements from the 80's were missing.An interesting detail that sadly put me off already at the beginning of the film as we're back in the 80's browsing an arcade, - the monitors in all game cabinets are of flat screen type!? This is painfully obvious given that flat screens weren't around till at least 15 years later. All games then used standard CRT displays. In later scenes there were some CRT televisions and old CRT computer monitors shown.Personally I would have liked more of the classic games involved in the invasion. Where was Gorf, Moon Patrol, Ghosts n Goblins and several other of the time's famous characters? Donkey Kong, which by the way was a tad too generously promoted, is and always will be a great game, but as the supreme ruling force of the alien invaders, the monkey is just out of its place. Why not have the Gorf mother ship pose as the ultimate threat?Even though the film manages to deliver plenty of game nostalgia, as well as hang on to its objective as 'pixels VS humans', I can only give it a mediocre score. Because of its lack of research in the area of video game history, where it should, and could do much better. "Pacman and Donkey Kong" are of course two of the most famous games ever created, but how about a 'giant kung-fu master' walking down the street, kicking and beating buildings and vehicles? Or the Moon Patrol rover shooting down airplanes? And what about Scramble? I noticed the Konami logo on a few occasions, but where were the games? So much I missed in this film, yet I still enjoyed it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film starts well with a fun look back to the 80s, and then immediately makes its first mistake. Hollywood never learns, using a cookie-cutter approach by implementing a coerced, annoying, unnecessary, implausible love story between Sandler and Monaghan, and later (Spoiler alert) an even more ridiculous one with "Ludlow" and "Lady Lisa", who (unfortunately even at the expense of QBert) miraculously falls in love with him and therefore opposes her makers ... downright laughable, unnecessary, coarse, boring, this is a movie about old video games, no romantic comedy!!!!!! The generous four points are merely for the battle against Centipede, the one against Pacman and for casting Sean Bean and Ashley Benson (albeit her unworthy role). In short, the film could have been great, if the makers had been concentrating on the core story, but when Sandler and James notwithstanding the premise do their usual BS, the bottom line is only disappointment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think that at some point in his career Adam Sandler lost sight of what his demographic is. Most can agree that his 90's work is pretty good if not great - Waterboy, Billy Madison, Wedding singer. But most of us were kids / teenagers at that point and even now in retrospect while we realize that those films are a tad idiotic, there was still fun to be had. But not anymore.Pixels does not know who it's trying to reach. It has all the retro gaming references that will appeal to the 20-30 year old, but the humor and overall acting that might amuse a 10 year old at best. The casting, oh god where do I even begin. First of all, stop casting beautiful women as Adam Sandlers love interest. I mean come on - Kate Beckinsale, Jessica Biel, Salma Hayek, and now Michelle Monaghan? But the worst part - Kevin James as the president. Have you seen Paul Blart Mall Cop? Exact same character. I lost it there.I won't even get into the stupidity of the plot because that would take ages to get through. In the end I'd say that aside from the retro gaming scenes that some might find amusing and spark a hint of nostalgia, there is nothing appealing in this movie. Quite the contrary.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Im giving this 5 out of 10. The reason is that the whole concept behind this idea is really kind of cool. Video games coming to life, now who doesn't think thats cool? But the film wasn't what i expected. the characters were believable but obvious. Some of the action like the pacman scene being watched on the computer was kind of cheesy. It just didn't give a wow factor and i think the movie really could have done that. But for a new style of movie, it was a good shot and thumbs up to everyone involved. Unfortunately this is not a film I will be seeing again though. Once is enough. I wouldn't say its a waste of your time to watch it, because some people would totally disagree. I recommend watching it and seeing for yourself. Its the only way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Everything works except the characters &amp; how they're written</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although video games have not been around as long as the car or other significant technological advances, it certainly has an equal amount of an impact in today's' society. Which only started as a couple lit up dots on a screen in the early 70s, has turned into a worldwide phenomenon of competitions of expanded universes with detailed landscapes as far as the eye can see. It's amazing looking at the transformation of video games. The time that was most nostalgic for much of the older generation was during the 1980s when video gaming was starting to become a big thing. Kids around the nation would line up in front of buildings filled with arcade machines looking to spend their 25 cents to see who would be the next gaming king. It was a time when things were much simpler but still just as fun. French director Patrick Jean had an interesting idea. What would it be like if the video games we used to play with began attacking our world? What would happen? For the two-minute short film that Jean provided, it was a unique idea. For this big screen production of Jean's idea, the concept remains the same but now it has things added to it that don't make it as fun. Adam Sandler plays Sam Brenner, a frustrated electronics repairman who longs for his gaming days back in the 80s. However he gets this opportunity after what appears to be old video games attacking the city. So he gathers up his associates, Cooper (Kevin James), Ludlow (Josh Gad) and Eddie (Peter Dinklage) to help fight back. With a screenplay penned by Tim Herlihy (a frequent Sandler collaborator) and Timothy Dowling (Role Models (2008)) knowing what might be included in the story ended up being predictable. A major element that wasn't necessary to include was the love interest subplots for multiple characters. Practically every main character has a struggling relationship with somebody and they all look to better themselves. Brenner ends up meeting a divorced mom, Violet (Michelle Monaghan) only through forced exposition of her son. What child talks to a stranger like that? There's also Ludlow's fantasy of being with Lady Lisa from a game he plays. Even Brenner's childhood rival Eddie wants to be with Martha Stewart and Serena Williams. All these threads tally up and just pad the film making the momentum slow down. Oh and don't forget the potty humor - a trademark of Happy Madison productions. There's also a series of plot contrivances that make no sense and a number of noticeable continuity errors that add to the confusion of how some video game characters are more developed than others are. A blatant example is Q*bert; how does he have a conscience but not Pac-Man? Even with these problems, this could've been tolerable if the characters were funny. Unfortunately very few are. Kevin James plays one of the goofiest presidents seen on screen and Josh Gad plays it mostly awkward the whole time. Sandler occasionally spews out a line worth of a chuckle because he's trying to sound like an old timer, but it's not often. The rest of the time he just sounds like he's saying whatever came to mind at the time. It doesn't even matter that Sandler is cast with his usual buddies but at least switch up the role. His female co-star is equally sporadic. Dinklage just being snobby stuck up gamer was the best part. There are other appearances from credible actors like Brian Cox, and Sean Bean but they end up being wasted. It's sad that all these issues are just as powerful as the positives. For direction at least, Chris Columbus headed this project instead of Sandler's regulars. The visuals are a nice too. The special effects that make up the video game characters and how they pixilated the surroundings is wonderfully colorful. The director of photography was Amir Mokri (Man of Steel (2013) &amp; Transformers: Age of Extinction (2014)), a guy who has plenty of work dealing with blockbuster scope films.The other bonus of to this movie is the nostalgic factor. For those who really enjoyed playing games like Asteroids, Q*bert, Frogger, Super Mario Bros., Space Invaders, Donkey Kong, Pac-Man, Centipede, Duck Hunt, Tetris, etc. - the fact that seeing these iconic games on the big screen is awesome looking. It does kind of go back to how video game movies don't work though because a gamer would rather play and be interactive than submissive and just watching a game happen. Lastly, the film score was decently made too. Composed by Henry Jackman (this would be his second video game score - his first being to Disney's Wreck-It Ralph (2012)), the score lacks a main theme but does keep the energy moving throughout the action scenes. Even for the slower scenes Jackman has tunes that sound okay. And of course, since this is a film that hearkens back to the 1980s, the soundtrack does include 80s bands like Loverboy and Queen. They even got Daryl Hall and John Oates to play a cameo. That's awesome. The good is equally countered by the bad. It has decent music, colorful special effects, clear cinematography and a large nostalgic factor based on its library of retro video games. Sadly all this is bogged down cliché casting and character development, hit and miss comedy and not enough focus on the video games.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Waste of time, not worth watching.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was hard to watch. The first 10 minutes of the movie were slightly fun, but the rest is unwatchable. When the pixel games came to life I liked the way they looked, but they did nothing important or cool. It was a boring movie and in my opinion a waste of time. There was little to none character development. The first 10 minutes of the movie just flashed through the story of a kid that's good at video games. There should have been more in the movie about that kid and his friend, it was just a combination of random shots and scenes that meant nothing. Things Just Happened for absolutely no reason, like when they met the little boy that was in love with the girl from the game - "you have no friends, do you ?" said the good gamer's friend - "just my grandmother" said the lonely boy - "well you can hang out with us" said the gamer kid. What the hell was that? There was no point, no meaning whatsoever, it just happened, that's the end of the conversation. We know nothing about either of the characters and the movie just continues like that's all we need to know. I'm very disappointed and feel like I've wasted my time and I hope not a lot of people feel like I do. That's why I'm giving this review, I'm trying to save most people from having to watch this movie. Just don't.</fullReview>

Adam Sandler does a great job, toning down his normal over reactive and colourful style, which is a nice thing as far as I'm concerned. When you get past that part of him, he's really a very capable actor.Overall the acting was well done, the writing was decent (with a lot of 80's references that were fun), it was cast well, and it was visually fun. What more do you expect in a movie of this genre and style? Was it a life changing, moving experience? Of course not, but if that's what you're hoping for, you're doing things wrong. Turn this one on for some fun, some humour, and a couple hours spent with the family that you won't regret.</fullReview>

It is very clear their target demographic was gamers and people with nostalgia for games like pac-man, and it works! I am a gamer and i really enjoyed this film. The special effects are some of the best I've seen in a film like for instance during the climax when the aliens are attacking new York they use the tetris blocks and when they line up by a building half of the bulding disappears.7/10: Decent</fullReview>

I found this movie a bit weird at first, but as the movie progressed it got better and better. A lot of kids would find this movie funny and hilarious not to mention the oldies too, but at some parts of the film I found it was a bit boring, however I do recommend this to a lot of families.

Very good to excellent game graphics and seeing everything cross the screen rolls back time to many fun hours playing these games. Seeing Lady Lisa come to life had to be the dream of many watching this story unfold. Good for Ludlow! And Eddie getting the phone call at the award presentation also great fun. So yes it was rough at times and fast and amazing the rest of the time.Good material for family talks after you see this story - old school games versus new.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I know Adam Sandler's movies aren't what they used to be, but reading the other reviews, it's as if this is the first slapstick comedy movie any of these people have ever seen. If you're a certain type of person, I guess you just can't get past your rigid thought processes in order to suspend disbelief long enough to watch a movie with a clearly absurd premise. Once you learn that about yourself, you should stop seeing films that are obviously meant to be stupid fun.For those who don't mind a fair bit of tom foolery, this movie is above average. It's not high art, but it has some very funny moments, and hits a lot of the same 1980s nostalgia buttons Adam Sandler movies often press. The film is comparable to Grown Ups, but for the crowd who played video games before they were cool.I liked it, my date (who is quite a bit younger and never played video games) liked it. It was a pretty inoffensive film with lots of stupid humor. Again, it's nothing special, but if you turn off your brain it makes for a fun time.It's certainly neither a 1-star movie nor a 10-star movie. In fact, I rarely trust people who rate films in absolute terms. I've seen very few perfect movies and even fewer that were total garbage, but I've seen thousands of films in that 3-8 range.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's rare for me to go see a movie; many of my options are limited because I just don't like dark, gritty movies. I miss the movies where you can sit down; laugh, have fun and not have to deal with violence, nudity and swearing.Safe to say; Pixels delivered just that. Adam Sandler plays an awkward, but likable nerd named Sam Brenner; who gets his shot at becoming a Hero by doing what he does best; playing arcade games. It's fun watching his clever know-how, outwit the alien invaders; as he uses all the old gaming techniques to take down their finest warriors. Making it this film jam-packed with; action, humour and most off all, sheer joy.The story is solid; it doesn't veer off, slow down or get clunky; it sticks to the objective till the end. it set's itself off right as being a silly movie by having Mr. President being played by comedic Kevin James, a wise move considering this movie is supposed to be a comedy; with that said, the movie's genre is well balanced to handle a subject such as pixels.Most likely, those who would enjoy this film would be one who are familiar with these games, back in 80's. So if you want to take your son or daughter to enjoy it with you, be warned; Peter Dinklage plays a foul-mouthed gamer, he says things like "I made your game my B****" or "S***Balls" and other rude phrases, so be warned.All in all; it's the perfect summer film to enjoy this week and one I think, I'll see again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Yes its ridiculous but funny and entertaining.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I want to start off by saying that, I have never reviewed a movie before. I felt compelled to do so due to the bad rep this movie appears to be receiving. The bottom line is it was comical and entertaining. The idea though ridiculous, was at least fresh to all the movies being produced today appearing to be recycled from other movies. It kind of reminds me of the original Hot Tub Machine movie that was unexpectedly a fresh idea and was entertaining. Like that movie , there were parts of this movie that were just plain funny and amusing. The movie theater I was in most people laughed multiple times, I can not remember another movie (recently) where the majority of the moviegoers were noticeably laughing. I enjoyed the movie for a new idea and found it to be entertaining. Isn't that what a movie is suppose to be?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Personally I loved this movie! It is def meant for people who grew up playing the games from the 80's. I'm a 90's baby but I grew up playing those games and this movie took me back. It's def a comedy and you have to watch it with an open mind. It was funny and really cute and brought back lots of memories. I would highly recommend going to see if for the nostalgia of the good ol days and for a good laugh. Oh and the graphics!! They were so good!! You got the retro 80's feel with the games but so much better quality! A++++ for the graphics! I liked the group of actors they used for this movie. They also grew up in the time period that these games were from so I know they enjoyed making it. It's just a really fun movie!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am really surprised by all these negative reviews and why people put all they're attention to details that really don't change a thing. Never the less, i found this movie quite hilarious and entertaining.This movie made me feel so happy that i was born in between the 20th and 21st century so that i can enjoy and understand this movie a tad more than some others.First of all i want to address the elephant in the room and by that i mean the "Adam Sandler is a terrible actor" bandwagon. Eh, i strongly disagree whit this, Adam is a great actor, the things that put him down are bad scripts, but in this movie he did an amazing job.Never in my life have i seen a movie about video games, and actually be good. I thought there was a good reason that this movie had such a low rating, so i set off to investigate and i came back whit pretty much nothing apart from the "bandwagon" i talked about earlier and the fact of people saying that this movie is not "realistic," its a movie with 80's video games for crying out loud.This movie has surpassed my expectations and also made me giggle like a school girl. It had an interesting story (as far as video games go).Also, hats off to the CGI department, simply amazing animations, it really felt as if the actors were actually where they seem to be.So, if you like 80's video games, like a nice comedy and have a spare 1 hour and 46 minutes on your hands i really recommend you watch this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was genuinely delighted about how good this film was. Honestly, I was expecting something humorless and stupid. However, it was a crazy, humorous film. It sort of reminded me of a live action version of Wreck it Ralph.Adam Sandler's acting could have been much better, but not his worst either (save that for 1989s Going Overboard). Kevin James wasn't bad as Cooper, the President of the United States. He was genuine.I did think it was great that Sandler included, literally his entire family in the film. But I wondered why his wife didn't play his love interest. Awkward!?The graphics of the film were great too, especially loved the way they used the CGI to make the old 8-bit computer characters. The Pac-man chase was the highlight of the film. And the ending was pretty good too, featuring an array of first generation characters, and Donkey Kong as the final boss battle. I think kids may like the film, but needless to say, watch with an adult as the film is rated PG-13. The younger kids may know a few of the game characters.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Written by a 12 year old</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This script must have been written by a 12 year old. Its every kid's fantasy come to life. The world is under attack of aliens and president Kevin James calls his best friend Adam Sandler. It turns out Adam is the hero video games always said he was and spending all that money at the arcades prepared him to be that hero. Meanwhile Josh Gad gets to yell at a bunch of soldiers who would just knock him out in real life, gets with a video game character and has Q-Bert kids with her. Its pure wish fulfillment.Adam Sandler shows that he can be funny when he wants to be and this is probably the best he's been in a long time. Josh Gad is great to watch for the reasons I mentioned above but Peter Dinklage is the best thing about it. They have also decent performances from Brian "Lets Blow Up Google" Cox and Sean "If I say Its A Beer Commercial, Its A Bloody Beer Commercial" Bean.The concept and effects were amazing, they have real life versions of Centipede, Tetris, Pac Man and Donkey Kong. They pay a lot of attention to detail, they not only get the mini-cooper ghosts the right colour (which would have been enough for me) but also use the right names on the license plates.There are some plot holes, it makes no sense Eddie Plant would have been able to get away with using a cheat code under the eye of thousands of people at a tournament, the movie does not even try to explain how an arcade game cheat code could be used in a real life car, Pac Man does not have cheat codes and it makes no sense for there to be cheat codes for the ghosts when Pac Man is normally the player character.I also think Lady Lisa should have been introduced before the finale (maybe she could have been the reward for defeating Pac Man) as there is not much development for her (I don't think she even had any lines) or her relationship with Ludlow and the subplot is sorta just scrammed into the last few minutes. However I would not go as far as calling Ludlow's obsession creepy, its probably just SJWs trying to find something wrong where there isn't. Its also a shame the dog from Duck Hunt didn't get shot (which people must been wanting for the past thirty years).The credits were cool, showing arcade games of the movie's events.In all, the movie is a fun ride.</fullReview>

They did not do the games right, and it's not that funny (typical Adam Sandler movie) but not horrible either. I am still wondering why Peter Dinklage agreed to this movie. Did he not read the script? Did he not know what Adam Sandler movies look like? Also Toru Iwatani, how did you accept a disgrace to your game? I mean OK, it's a passable movie, acceptable with Adam Sandler standards but still, if you are selling movie rights for IP should you not research what the buyers are planning to do with it?

I watched it in the theatre and it was way better than people said.Pixels is a good time and funny and it's better than people say. It has good jokes at times that. Are you laugh. It is a Adam Sandler film but it also is his best since the 90s. This film had great effects for games that 80s game will love to see. Peter Dinklage as the culling is great he is great in this film. And Kevin James as the president is random but still funny to see him fighting these pixels. The film has a lot of references adults will pays those games. If you love games from that time you will have a good tie. Like I did it is well made and funny and as I have said the best Adam Sandler movie is years!</fullReview>

Do all movies have to be the same basic story line in order for the critics to like them? This movie definitely brings back memories for those of us born in the 80's. Yes, there are a few ridiculous scenes in the movie, as is often the case in fun,comedy movies, but overall, the acting is fine, and watching the games come to life is exciting. In my opinion, it is definitely worth the watch. Sit back, relax and enjoy the imagination and fun put into the movie, while sipping a glass of wine. :D Sometimes it is better to see for yourself than to trust the critics. They are looking for something different than the average person wanting to simply see a fun film that takes you away from the reality of life for a few hours. :)</fullReview>

Adam Sandler plays an off-beat character (as usual) - but he really does a great job. But It's not just Adam Sandler that makes the movie good - It's funny story line brings a new meaning to the words "Video Games". When aliens reply to a capsule of video games sent into space when Sandler's character was a kid - Sandler must join forces with a "Few Good Men", to destroy the attack from the aliens. You know what's funny? The aliens send the same video game villains to destroy everything they come in contact with that was sent in the capsule. Now is the time for a battle of video game skills and great courageous tactics. You will see video game characters from your childhood - you will see a bunch of dopey guys trying to save the world - Don't take this movie too seriously and you will enjoy it - I find some comedies offensive - but the humor is clean and family friendly - You gotta see this movie - It's really funny and worth a watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't get the hate....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An alien invasion horde, taking the form of a bunch of the 80's video- game characters want to destroy the Hearth. That's the main premise for this movie. Simple as that. That being said, and browsing trough the reviews on this website, I've found out that most of the writers expected an intricate assay about Human existence and the very purpose of life. The movie title, "Pixels" somehow passed on to them the idea that all spiritual, human and metaphysical mysteries that plague Human beings throughout they're history, were going to be unraveled and demystified at the spot. To all of this viewers, this is "the worst movie ever"; "the type of movie that only stupid people enjoy". In my humble opinion, this is a entertaining film that is far from being perfect. It is a excellent choice for a Sunday afternoon, with your kids. You get action, laughs decent enough performances, over the top but ingenious plot (with some holes indeed, but hey video-game characters want to destroy the Earth...). Come on people... it's Adam Sandler! What could you expect? You can not eat candy expecting it to be caviar, but you can always eat one and enjoy it's sweetness... even if it isn't Belgian chocolate truffles...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A movie to enjoy at the weekends</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To be fair this was my second option to see at the local multiplex because I was interested to see Ant-Man. But in the end my best friend Sven went to see it with his friends instead. I only went to see this at first because I was curious to see Peter Dinklage's performance. By the end of the movie I really had a great time. Yes, it feels like a Happy Gilmore movie yet surprisingly there is little of that probably because of Chris Columbus' direction. Sandler wasn't that much of a hyperactive moron, Kevin James played it cool, Monaghan was hot, Josh Gad got all the embarrassing lines and Dinklage was to me the highlight of the movie. Eddie Plant is probably one of the most bad ass characters in comedy. The fights between the nerds and the video game characters were beautiful, there are some great shots. In the end, this movie just like BvS doesn't deserve the hate for no apparent reason (the reason for this one being just because it is a Happy Gilmore production) and you should consider watching this only when you are free on the weekend. Also that ending was so funny I almost fell down.</fullReview>

Classic arcade game icons attacking the Earth has enough silly charm in the premise and some of the jokes are worth a chuckle (despite the very "Wedding Singer" cut-n-paste jokes that constitute '80s nostalgic humor). But in the end, this is an Adam Sandler vehicle, and all of this is tailored to his indifferent personality. I have no problem with him; he can be a great actor. When he wants to be. But does anyone really buy him here as an uber-nerd? "Pixels" has the big Summer budget and colorful visuals to match, but it's all wasted on lazy execution.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ridiculous fun.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not an Adam Sandler lover or hater, though, sometimes I can't stand that affected voice he typically does. He's had only a couple of movies that I have liked, e.g. The Wedding Singer and Anger Management. After Pixels got panned by pretty much every professional critic out there, I was pretty sure I was never going to watch it...Then, I was going to spend time with my mother and she asked me if there were any decent movies to rent. So, I jokingly said Pixels. I thought she knew what it was, knew it was an Adam Sandler movie, would know I was kidding, and pass it over at the Red Box. To my surprise, she showed up with Pixels in hand. My mother hates "stupid" comedies and she hates Adam Sandler. I started laughing and apologizing for the confusion. She asked what the movie was about and I began to tell her what I knew from the trailer but I couldn't recite the premise without bursting out laughing - aliens, video games, death match - it's all ludicrous. I think the premise was so ridiculous, it actually intrigued her so much, she wanted to see how bad the movie actually is. Besides, she already rented it.Is the movie ridiculous? Yup. Is Kevin James as president outside of belief? Absolutely. Is designing and building guns from an arcade game in less than a week outside of any scientific possibility? Of course. Did I like the movie? Uh huh. Did my mother like the movie? Why, yes she did. Did she laugh out loud a few times? Amazingly, yes. If you care about the believability of the plot, you are going to hate the movie. It's about aliens sending Pacman, among others, to Earth - the believability is out the door before the movie even begins. Were there plenty of plot holes? I'm sure there were but I was too busy enjoying the inanity of the whole thing to notice. If you are watching an Adam Sandler movie to point out plot holes and what not, save yourself the time and don't watch it. And, Adam Sandler was far less whiny and annoying in this role.In conclusion, I thought the movie was adorable (and so did my mom). If you're looking for light-hearted silly fun movie to waste 2 hours on, you could do worse! Also, Peter Dinklage is so hilarious here, he steals the show.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a fun comedy movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's been so long since a movie has been so much fun and held my interest with quirky moments at the same time! Adam Sandler is his usual fun loving self in the movie and they have these big dreams when they're still kids, but we all know how you can dream big but don't reach the level you expected due to life that happens. Anyway, they are now adults and find out that their old habit and skills for playing video games comes in handy against an alien threat in the form of video game bosses that wants to fight humanity according to a time capsule containing video of them playing these games and defeating the end bosses, that NASA sent up during their childhood. Aliens have obviously misinterpreted the message and thinks they should do battle against Earth in the form of video game end bosses.Peter Dinklage really surprises with his very fun portrayal of one of the kids now grown up. He shows how diverse an actor he truly is and ends up being one of the most lovable characters in the movie. Don't listen to the bad reviews of this movie, as it might really surprise you just like it did me. I only really watched it because of Peter Dinklage whom I am a big fan of. Thank you for reading this review!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning As a young boy in the early '80s, Brenner (Adam Sandler) was a whizz-kid at arcade games, at a time when they had just come out and were all the rage. However, after a humiliating defeat to local rival Eddie (Peter Dinklage), he can't see his life going anywhere...and it doesn't, whilst years later his best friend Cooper (Kevin James) has gone and become the president. But Brenner's life might be about to change, after aliens in outer space misinterpret a signal sent from Earth as a declaration of war, and send an army in the shape of the arcade games he was once so good at playing to attack Earth. Brenner now must go from zero to hero, and save the world as only he can.Some films are harder to read than others. Sometimes, it can be difficult to work out whether something was meant to be taken seriously, as a piece of high art, or will end up leaving you to marvel at whether it was just a massive in-joke when you see the abysmal quality of the finished product. In a nutshell, some films were made to win Oscars, and some, while not being meant as bad, were simply made to switch your brain off and have some cheesy, shameless fun. It's safe to say a film about arcade game characters from the '80s being sent from space to attack Earth would fall slap bang in to the aforementioned category, and so anyone who approached Pixels with any sense of Citizen Kane expectations, and slammed it simply for what it is, would only have themselves to blame for not recognising the potential sort of entertainment factor it had. But somehow, it doesn't work even on this level.The revival of '80s nostalgia seems to be pretty high right now, and a lot of popular culture seems to be selling its premise simply on a concept that promotes that. So a film where a host of these former game icons, most notably a giant Pac Man, are among the main characters is a cat in the bag all of its own. Indeed, the film itself has a zany sort of Ghost Busters esque appeal about it, and the hope was that it could match the zany fun of those films. All the right ingredients are there, and it does manage some funny, enjoyable moments. But consistently, despite the affection for its source material, it fails to really be any fun and keep the tone going.Director Chris Colombus litters the most high profile thing he's done in years with a host of big name stars, including Brit actors Brian Cox and Sean Bean in comedic hard man military roles, whilst big name comedy star Sandler vies for comic affection from other established star James. Somehow, none of them can inject this missed opportunity with the spark it needs. **</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So I recently saw this film with my 13 year old brother and totally loved it. I am a little disappointed with the storyline though, but hey this made me laugh so it's okay. Josh Gad did an amazing job, VFX were great. Oh i really wish they included Super Mario somehow and I wanted them to include the childhood time more, it would have added more meat to the story, that is how we could have seen the character development. The film could have a had a greater value to it, if they just took the Idea of how when someone fails at the thing they think they excel at,they think they aren't worthy of anything. They could have not involved the cheat part as of then and made the protagonist realize it's okay to loose sometimes - because that's what you call being sporty- isn't it? I wish and hope the cheat part was revealed later when he got victory in Donkey Kong. Such cute alien invasion that I want them to attack us for real and leave us those cute alien things. ;) I got film to spend time on.</fullReview>

I was such a big fan of his back in the Happy Gilmore day, but lately (and by lately i mean the last ten years or so) he was only in awful movies. I almost got up and left for this one and i actually did that for Grown Ups 2. He may still be funny, but the movies he's in sure aren't. The only reason i gave Pixels 4/10 was because of the CGI which was on par and for the idea. Other than that, the acting is decent, but the scenes are just put together like it was a 10th grade school project. It has no logic. I think that the top positive comment on this movie says it all - being written by a twelve year old... Do yourself a favor and skip this one.

With just a bit more effort, and perhaps a more skillful director behind the camera, it could've been the kind of fun, agenda-free summer popcorn movie Hollywood doesn't - or perhaps can't - make anymore.If you like Adam Sandler and his trademark brand of humor (and for the record, I do more often than not) then you're still likely going to be able to mine 'Pixels' for a reasonable share of laughs and nostalgic rewards, but for everyone else your mileage will most certainly vary.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A dumb, fun comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pixels will perhaps best be remembered for being one of the biggest flops of 2015. While not as big a money-loser as something like Fantastic Four, it nonetheless didn't gross what it was expected to in the U.S., and therefore has a bit of a stigma attached to it. This is quite a shame, since Pixels is absolutely one of the better Happy Madison productions to be put out in the last decade. I'm not going to argue that Pixels is a masterpiece, or even anything close to being a great movie, but Pixels is, if nothing else, simply lots of fun.Pixels is a film that shouldn't even really appeal to me. I don't play video games, and I'm pretty much completely unaware of the history of any games past or present. As a result, I'm sure there are tons of video game references that I missed out on since I don't play video games, yet it never stopped me from enjoying the movie. Director Chris Columbus, who put together one of the best casts ever with Home Alone, fills the film with enough stars and solid actors that I was able to forgive the fact that the premise is beyond stupid. Columbus even manages to get what is probably a career best performance out of Kevin James as the president of the United States, who may or may not have been modeled after Chris Christie. Peter Dinklage, Josh Gad, and Michelle Monaghan are great in supporting roles that easily could have been nothing characters. Brian Cox and Sean Bean, known more for their dramatic work, have enjoyable small parts here. But, as expected, the real star of Pixels is Adam Sandler, which is the real reason this film has been dumped upon so heavily by critics.If Pixels had starred almost anyone else other than Sandler, it would have received more positive reviews. For whatever reason, Sandler attracts the worst kind of venom from critics, more so than any other modern day movie star. In Pixels, Sandler is Sandler, which for some people might seem torturous, but was great for me since I love him. As per usual, Sandler plays an underachiever who could do a lot more with his life, though he's not much of a man-child like he is in most of his other flicks. Being the star of the film, Sandler gets the very best lines and most amount of screen time, yet this doesn't feel like a vanity project. Everyone in the cast gets to have their moments. Even with everyone in the cast getting to have key moments, the movie never feels overstuffed. Chris Columbus keeps the comedy and rhythm moving at a smooth pace. Not every joke hits, though even if I wasn't laughing out loud at a scene, the movie was always pleasant to watch.I can't deny that Pixels is dumb. However, the movie is about as good as any movie about aliens disguised as video game characters attacking Earth could have been. This easily could have become an over-budget mess filled with just non-stop destruction and noise. The fact that it works at all is somewhat miraculous. Pixels may find more of an audience on DVD, and will perhaps be viewed more favorably in a few years. The film is certainly way better than its current reputation as a complete dud. Recommended to Sandler fans. 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoken about regularly as one of 2015's worst films, Pixels is a dire comedy made by and starring a bunch of people that should know better and a film that thinks some good old fashioned gaming nostalgia will be enough to win us over despite the fact this 'comedy' is scarily bereft of laughs, charm and features a cast that looks like they would rather be somewhere else, spending the money they earnt here on a not well earned break.I can't recall from recent memory a film that feels so tired, so bored with itself, almost resigned to the fact that it's not fun and it doesn't help at all that in a recent career full of bad roles and lethargic performances, Pixels features Adam Sandler at his very worst.The Oxford dictionary better update their recent editions as tired and uninterested needs to place a picture of Sandler under those definitions.Sandler's avid old school arcade gamer Sam Brenner is truly one of the worst leading characters of modern film. Possessing neither a comedic timing, an ounce of actual effort or any genuine hint of life, Sandler is but a zombie walking through this ugly looking cavalcade of ideas and uninteresting action scenes, scenes that are reminisce of someone playing a fun game but never sharing the controller as you sit back and watch. Sandler's career has once and for all slumped to a new low personnel low and the same can be said of director Chris Columbus.The man responsible for the first two Harry Potter films, Mrs. Doubtfire and Home Alone and also the writer of Gremlins and The Goonies, it's clear Columbus knows a thing or two about entertaining people through the medium of film but Pixels seems devoid of entertainment and Columbus must be blamed for so blandly directing this wannabe franchise starter. Wasting not only the chance to merge gaming lore with big screen thrills but support from the likes of an unbelievably bad Peter Dinklage (Tyrion would be sorely disappointed) and the sad supporting turns from actors like Sean Bean and Brian Cox.Any movie that casts Kevin James as the American President was going to have a hard time succeeding but really there is no excuse for Pixels to be so downright boring and lacking in joy. Getting a star purely around the fact it has some nice ideas that never eventuate into their potential, Pixels is such a sad state of affairs that many of its cast members will be wishing they had another life to spend on not signing up for this disaster in the first place. As for the idea of this becoming a franchise, game over man?.game over.1 episode of One Tree Hill out of 5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than expected, but my expectations were extremely modest</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Pixels" is exponentially better than expected, judging from the poster art and synopsis and having never seen the trailer. My expectations were so abysmally low that I felt compelled to watch a few minutes to satisfy my curiosity as to what they could possibly have been thinking. While it falls short of what I would consider a good movie that I would want to watch again to catch any subtle nuances, it has a few funny moments, the CGI animation is top-notch and it has a couple of amusing cameos. The film is infantile, schmaltzy and corny. Sandler's Brenner doesn't seem to grow, mature or develop much. Having risen to heroic stature to save humanity, he seems content to return to his life of mediocrity. We are left with a puerile fantasy fulfillment story with no moral that seems instead to pander to the self-indulgent mentality of adolescent video game addicts. As with many comedies, the romantic B stories also fail to rise above the level of adolescent wish fulfillment. The aliens seem contrived and inconsistent. They are smart enough to master intergalactic travel, but foolish enough to interpret a sort of travelogue film as a declaration of war. Q*bert indicates they were a happy planet until they received the message from earth, but they claim to have already destroyed many planets. When we do catch a glimpse of the aliens, in the guise of Q*bert, Max Headroom or Lady Lisa, they either join forces with the arcaders or inexplicably give them a second chance. "12 Rounds," "Predator," "Saw" and dozens of other films have antagonists who manage to engage the protagonist in twisted games much more convincingly. The movie goes to considerable lengths to make its characters unique, complex and multi-dimensional, but the aliens are generic 1950s B- movie aliens with twenty-first century weaponry. In the end, their departure is as unmotivated as their journey to our galaxy. We should also have seen Sinnamon. Her presence could have amped the stakes in the B story and provided fodder for jokes. The film is much better than I would have expected and has a few laugh-out-loud moments but never rises above the level of mindless entertainment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good film overall, but lots of upset for anyone with a passion for vintage gaming</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of very few films I made the effort to travel to a cinema to watch, was very excited for it because I'm a huge fan of vintage games and knew the title was wholly about them. It's a little above average, the special effects are good and the humour, on the whole, is quite good too, but as an aficionado of older games it doesn't do that aspect justice; there are a lot of incorrect references and it doesn't show the fantasy of that particular gaming age in it's full glory. The plot isn't too generic, but isn't exceptionally original. Overall, it isn't worth going to see at the cinema and, I feel, is likely to upset anyone who has a passion for gaming of the 80s.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Look, I get it...All Adam Sandler movies have actors from his other movies, like some ridiculous clique in Hollywood. That being said, this movie could have been much better with a few more believable characters. Dear Kevin James, Your humor and acting style is hilarious and never gets old. Or at least that's what I would have said in 2005. But it's 2015 now, and it HAS gotten old. You're the same old goofy Kevin James in EVERY SINGLE MOVIE you do. Haven't you learned any new tricks since becoming an actor? No? Looks like you're still coasting on the same old corny dancing you got so famous for in Hitch.Seriously though, if Adam Sandler movies always pull from the same pool of about 40 actors, why not cast Blake Clark as Brenner's dad who later becomes president? The president is ashamed of his son who is a simple Nerd Brigade employee. When Galaga, Pong, and Centipede attack, the president would have no choice but to listen to his gamer son. In just two sentences I've created a more plausible plot line than casting Kevin James as president. Pixels may have some serious flaws, but the movie would have been significantly more enjoyable if Kevin James had a smaller role, or perhaps none at all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A humorous movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pixels, based on the 80s arcade games, is an American movie that was just released this year 2015, and its protagonists Brenner (Adam Sandler) and Cooper (Kevin James) and also the presence of Peter Dinklage as Eddie, video game player. It is directed by Chris Columbus, who directed the first film in the Harry Potter saga. The story begins with Brenner missing out on one of the games, years later, he is a repairer of games that he spoke with his friend Cooper childhood, currently the US president, and when he went to work he met Violet who would soon have a relationship intimate. The such pixels, created by the aliens, invading the world and it created them did not like the message received by the US government and who knew it was Ludlow who gave the videotape to Brenner and Cooper and where with the help of own Violet, who is scientist, and her team, create weapons to destroy the pixels and it really is a game that has rules. This film hit the proposal that it was a comedy and was so well structured story, arrested me from beginning to end and Adam Sandler gave his comeback after movies bland as Jack and Jill, my score is 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sorely underrated, most honest fun since Ghostbusters.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Aliens in the guise of video game characters prepare to take over the world and a group of 80s arcade gamers re-team to stop the threat.From the director of Home Alone, Chris Columbus' Pixels plays as a mix of Wreck it Ralph, The Lego Movie and channels the likes of Independence Day and is reminiscent of Ghostbusters to name a few. This highly under-appreciated scifi comedy is a feature-length adaptation of Patrick Jean's video- game themed short. There's something for everyone but if you're a 30 something or more you'll find it hard not to like this retro game blast of a movie complete with arcade slot machine sounds. Opening in 1982 those with an appreciation of the late 70s and early 80s surely can't help but love the throwback gags. It then fast forwards to the present day with Adam Sandler, Kevin James and Peter Dinklage's characters all grown up. It's fast paced fun with aliens disguised as Hervé Villechaize, Madonna and President Reagan. The contemporary cheap quips about Gandalf and Harry Potter also hit the mark. As the grown up nerd gamers assist the President (James) to save the world it's good natured with a flood of one liners, fitting effects and a soundtrack emulating a bygone era. It's packed with references from StarWars to Tron, writers Tim Herlihy and Timothy Dowling induce nostalgia successfully.The supporting cast include the likes of Brian Cox, Sean Bean and Dan Ackroyd to name a few. There's also some celebrity cameos including Serena Williams and Martha Stewart. Characters from classic arcade games such as Paperboy, Space Invaders, Pac-Man and Donkey Kong among many others appear.Despite scattered anachronisms (who's checking) Columbus' Pixels is sorely underrated, it has great visuals and perfect comedy timing. It also has subtext about today's games. It's very entertaining, even if your 're not a retro gamer or and 8-bit lover, it still comes recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I enjoyed it because it reminded me my childhood.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are plenty of movies related to the video games. The 80s movie 'Tron' was one of those first I have seen, followed by many. But the recent one 'Wreck-it Ralph' was the game changer in the modern animation/CGI which led to another similar flick, 'The Lego Movie'. Lego and 'Toy Story' are the toys, not the video games, but very close to this theme and I'm very happy that Hollywood made this film for the guys like me who grew up playing them.The film had a very simple story with the great visuals. Sometimes simple is very good rather going for hi-tech. Especially those who played these games in their middle-age back in the 80s could be now very old and they might suffer to understand the film due to the technology/terms/phrase gap, if it matched to the todays hi-tech hi-resolution video games. But the youngsters of the present era didn't understand that who are the backbone of any movie's success and that's why this movie sunk in the ocean of criticism.My childhood and teenage was the late 90s and early 00s respectively, So 8bit games are on the edge of revolution. My favourites were the races and brick games, especially 'Duck Hunt', because I get a gun, not joystick. So this movie really brought me those sweet memories. A decade ago I used those unique sounds and music for message alerts in my 2G mobile phone(s).I know recently Sandler had hit the rock bottom in his acting career, but, he's kind of lifted after the decent film 'The Cobbler' and excellent multistarrer 'Men, Women &amp; Children'. This is not a massive comeback to what he's known for, comedies. But, sailing on average or above in better than falling downward in the career graph. To me this film was a better one, an above average, obviously not a masterpiece.Guest appearances were unexpected, but was not that effective, except Ashley Benson, who was so hot in her 2-3 odd minutes. This film is not for everyone. Youngsters and oldsters never understand it. If you were born in the 70s and 80s, then probably you will know what to expect. Even it does not deliver to your expectation, definitely gives satisfaction for bringing those lost memories of our childhood.7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Passable, but still disappointed...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was really looking forward to Pixels. The cast and plot were promising and I love retro video games. While this movie is 'watchable' it still fell short of my expectations. I can't seem to be able to put my finger on it but something just didn't feel right and I was getting bored toward the end. Some things are totally out of place though. For instance, Kevin James portraying the President of the United States was unfunny and didn't feel true at all. And I like Kevin James as an actor. I don't think they made good use of him in this movie. Then you have the most annoying character of the whole film; Q*Bert. Yes, they made this iconic video game character so irritating that I was almost wishing it would die in the movie so we could move along. All it does is whine and yell the whole time. Didn't they watch Wreck-It-Ralph? I don't remember Q*Bert being so annoying. And the last thing is when wonderkid is fighting lady lisa and then all of the sudden he throws out a bunch of pretty words and she just gives up trying to kill him AND on top of that Q*bert magically becomes her in the end just so we could have the ''happy ending'' gig. It just didn't work out at all. In the end, I just can't help but feel that this movie had the potential to be great but the plot and some of the writing is a hit- and-miss at some points. Overall, it's a nice time-waster when you feel like watching some stupid-fun flick that will get a few giggles out of you.</fullReview>

Kids will like it and I found it better than Wreck It Ralph. If you like The Big Bang Theory or Third Rock From The Sun this film was made for you. If there is one fault it offers nothing new and Sandler is still making nostalgic movie's but in saying that I hated Birdman, Whiplash and Child 44 which all got much higher ratings. At the end of the day it's an Adam Sandler movie, but there are a lot of nice touches in it like the registration plates on the Mini's,the Ghost Busters feel and Kevin James as the president which I find more believable than Donald Trump running!!

		<shortDescription>Ignore the haters, it isn't that bad. In fact, it's quite amusing.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So, yet again, I have put off watching a movie based on other people's reviews. As with Fantastic Four, I was expecting a horrible mess. You know what I discovered? That people are idiots, and they often write reviews.Pixels is a simple comedy about video game characters coming to life and attacking the world. It is a ridiculous premise and the movie doesn't take itself at all seriously whilst delivering on that premise.So why then, do I see people complaining about the plot, the characterisation, even the "unrealistic" characters? Simple answer is, they are "bandwagon" reviewers. The type of people to jump on the hate wagon "just because".Can you really be annoyed at the "unrealistic" portrayal of 8-bit video game characters? I guess, if you never experienced that era of gaming and expect everything to be photo-realistic.In a comedy where the world is threatened by video game characters, can you really be upset that there isn't more development of the individual characters or plot? I guess, if you were expecting some kind of serious alien invasion movie.So my advice to all and sundry is...take any review with the minimum effort of 10 lines with a pinch of salt. The person can't be bothered to make an effort to explain why they didn't like the movie. They just wanted to rant. Also, click on their name. See how many reviews they have done, and of what. Often you'll find that particular review is their only one. Or you'll see a pattern of bad reviews.This works just as well for glowing reviews, of course, which you should also treat with a huge pinch of salt.Likewise, automatically ignore any review that gives a 1 or a 10 unless you trust the reviewer.It is sad that most review sites these days seem prone to this kind of "ballot-stuffing" so you, the reader, must evaluate everything you read based on the motives of the reviewer, not the content of the review itself.So what is my motive for this review? Well, if I had to put it in words, just to think for yourselves. Whatever I say about Pixels, is my own opinion. I have no hidden agenda, unless it is to point out how you can't trust reviews.But enough shaking of the head at reviews...what about the movie? Pixels is harmless fun. That is all there is to it. It isn't the best written comedy, but I don't think they wanted to make a laugh-out-loud, snort-your-coke over the floor film. It is gentle comedy, with little if any swearing, and relying on the visuals and the actors' performances for the humour.Some have decried it as being sexist. But those people seem more intent on being offended for the sake of being offended. Any sexism on display is outright highlighted by the film for the purpose of being over the top. In other words, for comedic value. Yet some people seem to think that even this is too much. Personally, I'm tired of people being offended on my behalf. Apparently, there is a fine line between being offended at something, and being a preachy knob-end trying to ram your views down others' throats.If you remember the 80's, and remember video games, then there is nothing here that will shake your tree, offence-wise. If you didn't live through that era, and would prefer all movies removed anything that you might take exception to, then give it a miss.So, in the interests of balanced reviewing:SUMMARY FOR NORMAL PEOPLE: Entertaining light comedy based on 80's video games. Competent performances and a script that never takes itself seriously combine to make enjoyable viewing. Not something you'll watch twice, but fun for what it is.SUMMARY FOR... (WELL, FILL IN YOUR OWN SELF-IDENTITY HERE): Horrific mess of poorly written characters, script and with terrible CGI. Sexist and full of objectivism against women. Terrible! Avoid at all costs.PS: I just thought of something. Maybe we need an additional ratings system. Something along the lines of "Warning! This film contains scenes that are likely to be offensive to delicate butterflies and fluffy bunnies." Does that sound about right?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The rating here on IMDb for Pixels is too low. This should be in the high sixes. I mean, what is up with people? Is it because Adam Sandler is in it, and people expect it to be bad? Is it too unrealistic? What's the stupid reason for the low rating?The idea is pretty original. The effects are pretty much top notch. The acting is satisfactory. The humor is alright, nothing too advanced though.Pixels is actually of a pretty rare breed. It is a high budget, comedy/action/sci-fi disaster-movie. Maybe that's why people don't like it, it doesn't fit comfortably in one genre.Anyhow, I enjoyed it. It's not quite great, but good. I got a little bit of that late 90's - early 2000's feeling, which I love. The effects look really good. It has a couple of quite exciting scenes. I didn't find it super funny, but it has a light, nice atmosphere. The acting is pretty much like expected, but Kevin James stands out, and does a great job.It doesn't have a lot of tension, but it being a feel good disaster movie, it doesn't matter much.Don't take it so damn seriously, just let yourself be entertained, and you'll probably like it.</fullReview>

There will certainly be a generation gap with the audience in this film. Some will get it, some won't. My wife and I (both born in the early/mid 70's) took our kids (7, 9, 11) assuming they would probably enjoy it more than us. We were wrong. My wife and I were belly-laughing much of the time. And our kids laughed, too, but they didn't get most of it. (Our Singaporean audience didn't get a lot of the jokes, either.) Maybe we're just old enough to relate to these washed up gamers spending summers in front of REAL arcade games, where you had 3 lives before you had to cough up another quarter. When Max Headroom unexpectedly pops on the Silver Screen and starts to speak, how can you NOT laugh (if you even know who he is)?!?! Take a step back to your childhood (or a step in the childhood of your parents) and sit down to watch this one. It's predictable, and you may even roll your eyes a couple of times, but it WILL make you laugh. It could even become a cult classic...</fullReview>

I was quite happy with the gaming nostalgia and the best part about it was my 6 year son went nuts over it. Seeing my kids love a movie is worth admission for me, but I was captivated the whole time. You will not be disappointed by this movie, especially if you are looking to be entertained for 2hrs. I gave it a 9 because I would have liked more 80s game references.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's a good enough movie to waste some otherwise would be empty hours but the buck stops there. The delicious irony of it is that the protagonist of the movie is someone who feels they can only deliver worthy performances when they play video games that have predictable patterns, you know, just like movies with Adam Sandler starring in them. It's as if they throw darts at a rotating board filled with random words stickied on to it, just to see what it lands on so they can come up with these movies. Sandler throws first, dart lands on nerd, he plays the nerd. Sandler buddy number one throws second, dart lands on president, he plays the president. Sandler buddy number two throws last, dart lands on conspiracy theorist loner, he plays the conspiracy theorist loner.Just don't forget to throw in a delightfully cute piece of romantic interest in the mix (Monaghan) so that our nerdy hero gets his trophy at the end of the movie, since any flick that panders to nerds has to have some type of fan service add the chick with swords, long legs and cleavage and voila... you have one more forgettable movie on your Netflix catalogue.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The trailers looked crummier than the movie, but it did take me back to the 80s. it was doing well, but then Gad's character came in and the movie lost points with me. it continued to lose points with me every time Gad would speak. Sandler was good, Michelle Monaghan was good,but the movie could have done without Josh Gad and his stupid lines. Peter Dinklage's character could have been toned down and not be such a d-bag. He is a very good actor, but the character I could do without. I would rather have heard the music from the games than rap and not see baby Q-berts a year later. It does not get nerdier than a grown man pining for a video game woman. It would have been better to see Sandler a year later. The movie was decent, but could have been better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>not horrible but should have been brilliant</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sam Brenner and his chubby loser friend Will Cooper go to the 1982 Worldwide Video Arcade Championships. Ludlow Lamonsoff is a weird nerd with his grandmother. Sam loses to Eddie "The Fire Blaster" Plant in the final game. A tape of the event is sent into space as a message to aliens. In the present day, Cooper (Kevin James) is the ridiculed President of United States. Brenner (Adam Sandler) is still his best friend but he's in a dead-end job. He falls for Violet (Michelle Monaghan) who turns out to be a Lieutenant Colonel in weapons development. Aliens mistake the tape as a challenge and send light-based weapons in the form of the arcade game characters. Ludlow (Josh Gad) has turned into a conspiracy theorist and Eddie (Peter Dinklage) is in prison. The group has to use their gaming skills to defend the planet in a death match.There is a lot of hate for Adam Sandler. This is not that horrible but he wasted a great opportunity. I love this concept. The movie works great during the battle scenes. It's fun action with loads of 80s recalls. When the action stops, the movie gets really rocky. Sandler continues to have trouble being likable. He keeps playing an annoying douche although he's not as bad as some of his recent outings. He has lost his boyish fun charms of his early movies. His romance with Monaghan has its ups and downs. Kevin James starts out well with a bunch of girl scouts making fun of him. The problem is that he takes his cue from Sandler and overdoes it. Josh Gad needs to dial back the creepiness one level. Being obsessed with a pixel character is creepy although making her Ashley Benson helps a lot. Peter Dinklage is pushing too hard. In general, Chris Columbus has every character pushing too hard. They don't need to and it screws up an otherwise fun comedic action thriller.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Could Have Been a Good Family Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Overall, the movie was pretty good. The special effects were pretty cool, and it was neat to see so many classic arcade games that I remember from my youth. However, it was difficult to really enjoy this movie because of the excessive sexual references and bad language that really don't even contribute anything to the movie, in my opinion. My daughter wanted to see this, but I don't really want her to watch it because of the content. This is one thing I dislike about many Adam Sandler movies. I like a lot of them, but they just go too far with the sexual references and foul language, and since I have a family, I prefer to watch movies that we all can enjoy. This could have been one of them...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I didn't really expect much seeing as this had quite a low rating on IMDb and rotten tomatoes but in all honesty, the movie was quite good. Adam Sandler played his character well and definitely looked more alive than in Ridiculous Six. Kevin James and Peter Dinklage really nailed their roles as well. Music is pretty good and I personally think the CGI was really well made. I mean those pixelated smoke coming out of burned cars were really something.All in all I think this is a pretty good movie to watch with the family or if you just wanna relax.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was very hesitant about seeing this movie. From the trailer it looks good but having Adam Sandler and Kevin James in it was working against it, not to mention all the bad review I've heard since it's premiere overseas.I don't like Adam Sandler, I think him and his comedy is stuck in the '90s and I think 1 out of every 5 of his films, is even worth watching, let alone good!I like Kevin James and his characters even less!One thing to do if and when you see this movie is leave your expectations at the door. No, this isn't going to be cinematic brilliance but it did turn out to be a fun, enjoyable film.Adam Sandler and Kevin James were? dare I say? not that bad in this. Josh Gad on the other hand was actually very annoying and idiotic ? a role that usually is occupied by Sandler and James.There are a lot of funny moments through out the whole film but there are also some moments where they drag the joke on and on and on until it dies a horrible death. Also the way they portray the British in this film is pretty crap, with stupid, old jokes.As well as an awesome soundtrack, there is also the cast, aside from the above mentioned; Michelle Monaghan, Peter Dinklage, Brian Cox, Sean Bean, Jane Krakowski and Dan Aykroyd.An enjoyable, brightly colourful film that I would watch again, maybe even buy when it's in bargain bin or something.CHAPPY THINKS leave all expectations at the cinema doors and just chill out and watch an entertaining, fun movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Awful - No other words</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I very rarely take the time to review movies, but I had to put in my two cents' worth on this one. I should start by saying that I'm not a big Adam Sandler fan. I don't dislike him, I generally just don't like his movies. A few exceptions would be 50 First Dates, which I liked, and Click and The Wedding Singer, which weren't bad.But this movie . . . Wow! Did anyone read the script before they green-lighted it? I cannot imagine anything worse, even if they had intended to make a bad movie.More of the same garbage from Adam Sandler. This abomination has the same thing nearly all his other movies have had: humor that only eight, nine and maybe ten-year-old boys would (should) think was hilarious. So it's come to this: I honestly believe that if not for the normal bodily functions of humans (and animals of course) for Sandler to make fun of -- over and over and over again in this, and about all of his movies, he'd be a broke joke remembered mostly for his okay SNL skits from 25 years ago. From horrible dialogue to incredibly offensive stereotypes (and this is coming from someone who loathes being pc) this movie has just about everything you can think of to dislike in a movie.A truly awful movie that I couldn't get but about half-way through it was so bad.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pixels is the perfect family movie. the people who made its reviews mostly slammed it for Adam Sandler who has done bad work but not here. In fact Pixels just may be his best work since the Wedding Singer The plot is simple. In 1985 the US sends up into space a sample of its culture including video games. Now its 2015 and the Aliens believing they were challenged come to earth and attack us using video games characters. The only hope is to assemble a team of nerds who once ruled the video arcades in the 80s. To battle for the fate of the Earth. Intriguing story great execution. This movie lets the viewer use his or her imagination. And in the end it provides great entertainment. after all isn't that what a movie is supposed to do ? Entertain us ? Don't listen to the so called expert critics watch it yourself and make your own judgement. I'll bet you will be surprised at how much you like it and how much your kids will like it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pixels: Good, but Flawed - Mason Irving</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a good film, but it has its flaws.I saw this a few weeks after the film came out, and I was definitely hesitant, especially after I found the movie starred Adam Sandler. But, with direction by Chris Columbus, famous for the first two Harry Potter films and the first two Home Alone films, and not directed by Dennis Dugan, I was excited. And I really liked it! I should have expected the panning, but due to the previously mentioned factors, I was kind of shocked. I thought this film was good! Some of the jokes are spot on, like Q*Bert cussing, the creator of Pac-Man calling his creation a bitch (not knowing what that means, anyway), the scene where Josh Gad's character Ludlow is screaming at the soldiers that they are about to train, and Sam moon-walking into the Oval Office are some of the funniest moments in the movie. The visuals were awesome, and the plot was very well thought out. I really thought it hit the mark.Is it the greatest movie in the history of the world? No, that would be over praising it, definitely. This movie is funny, but not up there with the greats in comedy films like Monty Python (HECK NO). This movies without a doubt has it flaws. The character of Violet van Patten, played by Michelle Monaghan, is a boring and undeveloped character. I know she wasn't the main character in focus, but she is a MAIN character, and she NEEDS development. The romance is horrible. The scene in the beginning where Sandler's character goes in the closet and talks to Violet made me feel UNCLEAN. It felt like something a stalker would do. The two characters also have no development as a couple, taking the easy way out in that the girl is impressed by the heroic boy that she just met, and decides to get together with him. Some of the other relationships are bad, too. Q*Bert turns into Lady Lisa out of freaking nowhere, and she, a hot fictional character, marries this nerd who is in love with a hot FICTIONAL CHARACTER. Even if this sucked, the baby Q*Bert scene was hilarious. Some of the jokes were miss. The subtlety of the fact Sandler's character is a nerd is not subtle at all, unfortunately.I also hated the use of the cliché that all kids these days play modern FPSs like COD or Halo. It's not technically a cliché, because it is kind of true, but it made me cringe seeing it in a movie with 80s video game characters.Speaking of which, if you grew up in the 80s and 90s, you will CRY with nostalgia while seeing this movie. Everyone's here; Defender, Space Invader, Donkey Kong, Pac-Man, EVERYONE! And that is freaking COOL!Should you see this? Give it a try, you either love it or hate it. I think you should check it out. I can see why people dislike this film, and I respect that. But I just wanted to show you this movie in a whole new light. It's flawed, not the best, but I think you should try it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Like most Adam Sandler movies there is a lot of foolishness, but most of it is fun foolishness. I enjoyed it, my wife didn't see it, not her kind of entertainment.The story starts in 1982 when the main characters were boys who enjoyed the video games of the day, Pac-Man, Donkey Kong, those sorts that you would actually go to an arcade to play.Then in modern times as the boys are approaching 50 there is a crisis that threatens the very existence of Earth. Seems back in the 1980s a deep space probe contained a VHS recording of certain aspects of our society, in the hopes of someday reaching another civilized world. But these aliens mistook the video games for our form of battle and are invading Earth. Maybe the men who were video game champions back in the 1980s can save the world.Adam Sandler is the main gamer, Brenner, who in current times is an installer working for a business that sells TVs, sound systems, and the like. Kevin James is his good buddy Cooper who now happens to be president of the USA. When the crisis starts Cooper calls Brenner for help.One of the military leaders is Michelle Monaghan as Violet. Brenner's old gaming nemesis is Peter Dinklage as Eddie, currently in prison. The other friend is Josh Gad (way too young to be a kid from the 1980s) as Ludlow.The story includes its share of slapstick comedy. The aliens strike at such places as India, London, and New York City. The graphics are very impressive and overall a fun diversion for those of us who enjoy Sandler movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It had its moments</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Normally I can't stand Adam Sandler movies, but I decided to watch this particular one because of its nostalgic factor - 1980s video games, something I was a fan of all those decades ago. Still, I was kind of prepared for the worst. To my surprise, though I didn't think that the movie was successful overall, I had to admit to myself that the movie did have some strong positive attributes. One of them was a pleasant surprise, namely Adam Sandler. Though I have found him abrasive and annoying in other movies, here he is pretty palatable. And actually funny at times. There are a good amount of gags that actually work. It certainly helped that I was an old time gamer and could understand the amusing references to many classic arcade games. And the special effects used to bring these games to life are pretty good, colorful and innovative.But despite good things such as those, I didn't think the movie quite worked in the end. For starters, the opening credits state that the movie was based on a short film. While this story might have worked as a short, it doesn't work at 106 minutes long. The movie is too padded out and repeats itself a bit too much. Also disappointing is that we don't get to see the aliens as they really are, nor do we really get to hear enough from them to make them fleshed out and feel like a real threat. The movie also makes the big mistake of saying that the aliens saw video games from 1982 while showing a number of brought-to-life video games that came out several years later.Despite my feeling that the movie ultimately doesn't make it, my feelings towards it aren't really hostile. I can see some people would like it. I would advise you to read more IMDb user comments for this movie to determine whether in your case you may like it or not.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pixels: Not as bad as everybody says, but still far from great!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pixel was one of my most anticipated movies of 2015, Yes even with the other also great line up of this year. I mean arcade games used to be a threat to mankind, that is awesome, Chris Columbus as director for a child friendly (more or less) action comedy, that is fitting, Adam Sandler in a movie not directed by Dennis Dugan or Frank Coraci, that can be a career change in the good way. There is one thing which can make a movie like this don't work and that's laziness and you can bet on what happened, the movie becomes lazy. Still the movie isn't as bad as anybody says it to be, its average not more and not less. Let's dive into detail Visuals: If you know Chris Columbus you know that he can't fail on this point and he didn't, there are some weak spots in the visual department but overall the movie looks good and resembles the feeling of an 80's arcade game. The Action is shot well; the scenery is nothing special but still very convincing and gives just the right feeling. It is colorful it is crazy and chaotic and in such a movie it should be. If you don't like the style, this movie wouldn't be for you anyway. Story: Here we go into the territory where it begins to fail. The Story itself is alright, but for one it is nothing original yet the same concept as other movies at the likes of Independents Day or Pacific Rim and for two it consists of so much plot holes that you can't sometimes follow it or find some parts unnecessary or confusing. But in point of story I can get an eye closed because in a movie like this the story is secondary for the entertainment. Character: That is the part the movie fails! You did have one job to do in this movie, to entertain and while the movie did entertain visionary it seriously failed to entertain in the character. For a comedy it is hardly funny and the comedy is based on very superficial humor. The jokes are neither deep nor complex often they are the same one- liners and sentences over and over again. The acting performances aren't particularly weak, but very unbelievable, which isn't a smart thing to do in a movie where the action relies mostly on the reactions in the action scenes. With a namely exception of Peter Dinklage all characters play the same archetype they always are playing or fulfilling a movie cliché like the love interests and the needy boss. There was one funny scene in the beginning of the movie I really cracked up and even that scene was superficial, not well acted and filled with one-liners. Overall: Pixels should have been one of the greats of the year but failed in doing so. Is it a bad movie nonetheless, no but it isn't good either. Visually it is solid and hit the themes it used to hit. But the story is that bland that you can't really consider it being compelling or let it suck into the world. It is surely a fun flick to watch at a party or with someone special on a Sunday evening, but don't expect a masterpiece I give it an overall score of 5/10</fullReview>

Adam was awesome and was the perfect man for this role despite what some critics say. The author did a good job on the story lines and the music was wonderful. Kids from the 80s all remembered the arcades. Filled with games who's images were a blend of pixelated images which brought many fun hours to everyone's lives. These arcades were considered the coolest places to hang out, sadly these days with the ever fast pace moving technology video game arcades are fading out fast... this story reminds us of those fun days. Many harsh critics jumped to criticize this movie however they would soon understand they picked the wrong movie to pick on. All those gamers brought up in the arcade age will love this movie and back the film and Adam Sandler for years to come!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Grading on a Curve</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Adam Sandler's movies dropped off of a cliff close to ten years ago. I mean, the very plots haven't even been interesting enough to get me to watch. I gave a go at "Grown Ups" only to be disappointed (as such I didn't bother with "Grown Ups 2"). I gave "Pixels" a try for two reasons: 1.) I loved those 8 bit games the movie is based on and 2.) The trailers looked good.If we were to grade this movie on a curve (i.e. compare it to the Sandler movies of the last 10 years) then this would be at least a B+. If we were to grade it on its own merit, then I'm thinking more like a C. Acting was OK (he's long stop being funny), story was a bit flat and CGI/special effects were about what I expected. Nothing ground-breaking and nothing embarrassingly bad. If Sandler could just improve upon this movie; just build upon the successes of this movie and add more non-stale jokes, more range of actors than himself and his friends and something new then he may be able to recapture the success of old.</fullReview>

He's needlessly cruel to the "love interest" and is a terrible chore to sit through, enough said. Also, the addition of the White House and the military of all things is stupidly insulting because is renders the two as one big dumb,unfunny joke. One of the many, many dumb jokes that this movie pulls is 1980s references that are 100% witless and vapid. Bottom line, the movie is like Kylie and Kendall Jenner.

		<shortDescription>Where is Pac-Man</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>-Pixels is a 2015 American science fiction action-comedy film produced by Columbia Pictures, 1492 Pictures and Happy Madison Productions. The film was directed by Chris Columbus. Its screenplay was written by Tim Herlihy and Timothy Dowling, with a screen story penned by Tim Herlihy and based on French director Patrick Jean's 2010 short film of the same name. The film features computer animated video games characters, special effects, and stars Adam Sandler, Kevin James, Josh Gad, Peter Dinklage, Michelle Monaghan, Brian Cox, Ashley Benson, and Jane Krakowski. The film's plot has extraterrestrials misinterpreting video-feeds of classic arcade games as a declaration of war, and invading Earth using technology inspired by games such as Pac-Man and Space Invaders. To counter the alien assault, the United States hire former arcade champions to lead the planet's defense. -Principal photography on the film began in 2014 in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. It was released in 2D, 3D, and IMAX 3D in 2015. While Pixels received generally negative reviews from critics, it was a box office success, grossing over $243 million worldwide.--Critical response:-On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film received a 17% approval rating, based on 155 reviews, with an average rating of 3.8/10. The site's critical consensus reads, "Much like the worst arcade games from the era that inspired it, Pixels has little replay value and is hardly worth a quarter." On Metacritic, the film has a score of 27 out of 100, based on 37 critics, indicating "generally unfavorable reviews". In CinemaScore polls conducted during its opening weekend, cinema audiences gave the film an average grade of "B" on a A+ to F scale. -Peter Travers of Rolling Stone gave the film one star out of four, calling it "a 3D metaphor for Hollywood's digital assault on our eyes and brains" and deeming it "relentless and exhausting". In Salon.com, Andrew O'Hehir called the movie "another lazy Adam Sandler exercise in 80s nostalgia," as well as "an overwhelmingly sad experience" characterized by "soul-sucking emptiness." The Guardian called it "casually sexist, awkwardly structured, bro-centric" and warned, "Pity the poor souls who go into the comedy blockbuster thinking they've signed up to watch The Lego Movie by way of Independence Day. They'll be disappointed." Joe Neumaier of the New York Daily News gave the film no stars and wrote, "Someone please retire Adam Sandler. Pixels is the last straw for this has-been. . . . Every joke is forced, every special effect is un-special. . . . The dipstick Pixels is about as much fun as a joystick and not even half as smart." "It manages to achieve the weird effect of feeling overlong and choppy at the same time, like someone edited the film with a pair of garden shears," wrote Randy Cordova in The Arizona Republic. Kyle Smith wrote in the New York Post that Pixels is "as adolescent as a zit" with jokes "as fresh as the antique store." -"Everything is wrong here," wrote Megan Garber in The Atlantic Monthly, "cinematically, creatively, maybe even morally. Because Pixels is one of those bad movies that isn't just casually bad, or shoot-the-moon bad, or too-close-to-the-sun bad, or actually kind of delightfully bad. It is tediously bad. It is bafflingly bad. It is, in its $90 million budget and 104-minute run time, wastefully bad. Its badness seems to come not from failure in the classic sense?a goal set, and unachieved?but from something much worse: laziness. Ambivalence. A certain strain of cinematic nihilism." Peter Sobczynski, writing for rogerebert.com, called the premise promising but the execution "abysmal." -CinemaBlend film reviewer Mike Reyes, however, gave the film 4 stars out of 5, writing, "Pixels is one of those fun summer movies you've missed since you were a kid ... it's also extremely funny and vastly entertaining ... with thrilling action, stunning visuals, and some really well timed comedy."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"We're the only ones who can do this! I'm kidding, we're all gonna die." Sam Brenner (Sandler) is one of the greatest video gamers in 1982. After making the finals in the championships he is devastated when he comes in second. For prosperity purposes the video tape of the contest is shot into space. 33 years later he is working as an electronics installer when he gets a call from his childhood friend, President Cooper (James) telling him that the Earth is under attack...by video games. Now it is up to Sam along with other gamers from 1982 to save the world. This is a movie I was not sure what to expect. To me, Sandler is either very funny (Happy Gilmore) or unwatchable (Jack &amp; Jill), and I thought this one could go either way. I was actually leaning toward the latter but I have to admit I was pleasantly surprised and I laughed a lot throughout. The movie is really nothing amazing but what it is is very entertaining and a decent family movie. Growing up in the 80's I loved seeing all the old video game characters again and I have to admit that Q-Bert stole the movie. This is a very Sandler type movie and is not worth all the bad press it was getting. Overall, much much better than I was expecting and I surprisingly enjoyed this as did my family. I surprisingly give this a B+.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is a kids film OK. But it was a total disaster in terms of story, characters and logic. The story was really bad and in my opinion only a love story only. There were no difficulties to win at the whole time for "the good" earth people. Kevin James as president of the USA was embarrassing. He can be funny, but a president, really? just a bad idea to help the main character give him such a powerful help. The whole time the logic was not present, when i saw this guy...playing his first time an arcade game and hes getting under the best players of the world in the same year...kidding? It is really annoying seeing those films, because it is brainless one by one action with no background..."your an a**hole!"..help to save the world..."oh your such a nice guy!" for example. I really think most of the reviews are fake, because this film was NOT GOOD. Just another animated kids movie without nice characters to love and a flat pointless war story.A typical Adam Sandler movie is, when you know in the first 5 minutes how it will end and a dumb storyline will be shown.story 2/10 because it was flat,uninspired,predictable but got unused potentialactors 2/10 because they act unreal and changing mind every minutemusic 4/10 because we will rock you remix was terrible, but the rest was OKtechnique 10/10 because it was good animated and filmedi give it 2 stars, because technique was good, but does not count, because it is a must have in our times</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It had its pros and cons</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So, i skipped the theater, and thankfully so. This movie is not worth the cost (most movies arnt nowadays anyways), but this movie was really not that good. I love Adam, and some of his movies are my favourite all time (water boy, Bed Time stories, Little Nicky), but this movie is not high up on that list for me. The movie of course had its saving moments, and i did laugh quite a bit, and i enjoyed most of it, but overall, the movie was terrible.So the movie plot is: in the 80's, a group of friends loved arcade games, and one of the boys (Adam Sandler) became one of the best in the world, before loosing to Peter Dinklage. At this event, NASA had recorded the arcade games and sent it into space in hopes of communicating with aliens. Fast forward to present times, the friends have all moved on, one became a conspiracy nut, one became the president, and Adam became a software installation specialist. However one day, aliens land on Earth and challenge the humans to an arcade like game, using old arcade games, for the fate of the world and these friends must unit together once again to save Earth.So the pros: I liked the movie, it was very fun, had some good action, extremely good CGI when it came to the video game characters (i thought the centipede was awesome looking),the soundtrack was pretty awesome and combined with the action was very "pump up", the jokes were often on que, and the idea of Kevin James as President was beyond hilarious.Cons: The movie lacked any real depth, but it didn't aim to, the dialog between characters was often painful to watch and too corny, the forced love connection with the main characters, the massive amount of plot holesOverall: I liked this movie, it will surely become a cult classic, and it was fun to watch at home on a Sunday night on TV, but i wouldn't recommend buying it. I personally wouldn't reject it as a gift, but i wouldn't go out and buy it myself unless it was $5. From an actually technical movie perspective, it was lousy and deserves a 5. whatever it is, if not less. But don't let that fool you, because if you don't take it seriously, it was a fun movie. As an overall movie, it should be a 5.0, judging it based on what it was made to be, probably an 7.0...so i took the middle ground, and gave it a 6.0</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Made Me Nostalgic!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on French director Patrick Jean's 2010 short film of the same name, 'Pixels' is an exciting idea, that also made me nostalgic. It takes the cult arcade games of our time &amp; puts them in a story, that is often entertaining, despite some flaws. 'Pixels' Synopsis: When aliens misinterpret video feeds of classic arcade games as a declaration of war, they attack the Earth in the form of the video games.'Pixels' has some moments, that work on its advantage. The concept firstly is fun &amp; watching the legendary characters of the arcade games come to life, give us fan boys, pure guilty pleasure. However, the goings-on aren't always engaging &amp; the pace drops in the middle too. But, 'Pixels' needs to be watched with limited expectations, in order, to enjoy it!Tim Herlihy &amp; Timothy Dowling's Adapted Screenplay is mostly fun, but it could've been tighter. The second-hour, especially, lacks meat. Chris Columbus's Direction is passable. Graphics are pretty good. Cinematography &amp; Editing are okay. Art Design is accurate. Performance-Wise: Adam Sandler is as usual. Kevin James is superb as the goofy president. Michelle Monaghan is adequate. Josh Gad &amp; The Terrific Peter Dinklage are funny. Brian Cox is wasted. Ditto for Sean Bean. On the whole, 'Pixels' isn't an all-out entertainer, but yet its fun, especially for those, who've grown up on these games!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pixels was a cute movie with wonderful visuals. Independence Day this is not, so don't go looking for anything serious here... this is a COMEDY! If there's a moment they can interject 80's nostalgia... they're going to do it. And they did with style I have to say.The plot was simple... like an old arcade game... three tries and you're safe. Still not sure how the 'cheating' was done... but when you 'see' the codes... they are all various codes for home games- I think. Saw a glimpse of the Konami code in there too! Trying not to spoil too much. Will say the comedy had me laughing. My little girl got many of the jokes too. The action was pretty cool, and made you just want to jump in a join the silly antics. Now the bad... some of the adult jokes did seem a bit much for a mixed audience, and younger kids. Now, when Dinklage mentioned the 2 girl sandwich... I HAD to laugh when we see the women he wanted to see and... yes, they had a sandwich in hand! The best pun of the WHOLE movie. Yes, one guy "gets the girl." But I hate to say, she wasn't a 'girl' to begin with... and it was a lifetime fatuation... it was weird, and even Sandler's character made a funny comment about it too. Some may have object to it... but again, it just bad humor, which was actually funny and is the cause for the follow up scene in the credit. You can NOT take this movie too seriously.Now the REAL bad. Josh Gad... he should NOT have been in this film. When the trailers were shown months ago... my little girl was excited because she KNEW he voiced Olaf... well, Olaf he AIN'T and he makes Sandler's comedy seem classy. He was the wrong age, the wrong comedy, and just all around would have been a better film without the terrible, the lewd, and the wrong: Josh Gad. If he screamed one more time or showed his crack another time... I'd have left the theater.Overall the movie IS enjoyable and plenty of game CGI eye candy for all to see. And that's where the real gems in this movie are. The game characters! Q-Bert actually talks - which took some time to get used to. But Pac Man had some personality, so did Donkey Kong, and some of the others. Many details to take in all at once, is why I actually suggest a second viewing, just for the details alone. Yeah, the plot line is thin, but it's fun. Yeah, they could have blasted the ship out of the sky I guess... but where's the fun in that? It's silly, it's fun, it's a visual treat. Ignore Josh Bad, and enjoy the movie! I might have given it a higher rating had Gad not been in it. And people are complaining about Sandler!? It's better than you think... especially if you know these games, or born in the 1970's and remember all the fads of the 80's.</fullReview>

Critics these days gives very high ratings for movies that has no any entertaining sense just because it was shot with good camera technology or because the acting was very convincing like (Boyhood) they forgot that movies 1st mission is to make people feel happy when they see them even if it's a tragedy or painful story.

		<fullReview>If you're watching this for Adam Sandler then you already know what to expect and you won't be disappointed. It's not gonna change anyone's perception of Adam Sandler whether you're for or against. If you're watching for the Arcade Game nostalgia then there will be something there to entertain you but you may leave disappointed with some aspects. It is also surprising how hard it is to accept some characters in this film considering the premise and all but I just couldn't believe Kevin James character at all. That must say something considering I'm more willing to accept the Arcade Game Invasion this movie is about over his character and his portrayal of said character. Oh well, you don't watch Adam Sandler movies for the great acting anyway. Overall, for the hour and a half it was on, it entertained; though you won't get much replay value from it as I can see the jokes getting old fast. Not awful and not great... an Adam Sandler movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hello,so i was born in 1993 , so i pretty much grew up with these group , almost loved wasting every second of my childhood on them , golden moments that i will always remember before the consoles started coming out , i used to play on the sega console and dos games. anyways , i think the director did a pretty good job on the movie but he failed to address the 90's generation more specifically. when i heard this movie was coming out , i got super excited for it and not being arrogant but i felt like this movie was made for us(90's). everything was great , even in some moments i got goosebumps but was disappointed by some stuff, i think the director made the movie for kids and can't blame him actually based on the topic but he could've at least focused more on the games and on the story for our sake at least. also the jokes in the movie was just another Adam Sandler flick which was already said enough all over the internet that does not need addressing anymore which made me sad , i mean don't get me wrong , i even like adam and he was a good choice for this movie but i wanted the movie to focus more on the its epic story which could v made it into a fantastic memorable movie instead of another regular adam sandler something. i also expected couple more games to appear such as sonic but no pressure on that point as good enough games already appeared given the required running time of the movie. i gave it a 6 thanks to the CGI and graphics which perfectly portrayed pac man and all of the other games and because i really wanted to like the movie.</fullReview>

Yes, this movie is not expected to be like top seller for sure. It was a decent movie. The plot is still make no sense to me after I have watched it twice. The jokes in this movie is better than those in the "yellow-ish" movie. It is a pretty funny one. The games pick being put in movie, it was a pretty good choice, could had been better if it was a little bit longer. The "earth v. alien" battles were not satisfying, should had pick another one or two games to put into the movie. It is not a bad movie, it just underrated since the trailer, but cannot rate it higher due to the misery plot.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Totally unrealistic, completely unbelievable. You see Adam Sandler, you think this will be a rubbish film. And it isn't. It's actually a very good film, once you can get over Kevin James being the President of the US. The 3D is not very noticeable most of the time. For those, like my husband, who remember the early 80s games, it's nostalgia. For those, like me, who don't, it's initially a bit confusing. Ultimately, it's a fun film, though there's not much to it. The post-ending shot is cute, though. Adam Sandler isn't quite his annoying usual self - back to the "Bedtime Stories" Adam, thank heavens. It's OK for a bit of fun. If you're looking for a meaningful film, you wouldn't pick a Chris Columbus/Adam Sandler combo, would you?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A "Ghostbusters meets Wreck-it Ralph" Sandler film as fun as the best video game level</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pixels is all about aliens on 1982 who intercepts video feeds of classic arcade games and misinterpret them as a declaration of war, they attack Earth, using the games as models. Knowing that he must employ a similar strategy, President Will Cooper (Kevin James) recruits his childhood pal, former video-game champ and home-theater installer Sam Brenner (Adam Sandler), to lead a team of old-school arcade players and a military specialist (Michelle Monaghan) in an all-out battle to save the planet. Pixels is based on a Youtube short with the same title (Pixels) created by Patrcik Jean. Adam Sandler's movies always has these kind of good ideas but with something really wrong. The problem were some of the jokes. They fell flat, really flat. That's the first problem of the movie, flat jokes. The second problem is the acting of Sandler. To be honest, Kevin James acting was okay. Josh Gad's and Peter Dinklage's acting was very good, but the weakest is Michelle Monaghan's who doesn't look like she likes her role. Adam Sandler's acting is worse than Monaghan's. Sandler is not trying to give his best, and he ended up looking like he gave up in acting. He was better in Hotel Transylvania where he looked like he was happy with his role. But the biggest problem yet is its promotion. No, it's not the marketing and advertisements, it's what it wants others to do such as yell at their parents, be disrespectful to others, etc. It was advertised a lot to children but swearing and those what I listed? Those are very unacceptable to kids. And finally, the lack of story. All just for laughs. However, that should be part of your expectations for the movie. That's what is always part of a Sandler movie, no story and all for laughs. But there is one thing that is rare in Sandler films, the films being enjoyable. If Adam Sandler and Kevin James wasn't here, I'm very sure it would have a 6.7 - 7.5 score since it was directed by Chris Colombus, director of Harry Potter and Home Alone which had a 7.0+ score. Pixels is just like watching someone play a "Wreck-it Ralph meets Ghostbusters" level. Although charmless, it is as fun as the best video game level there is. I don't care if haters will bash me or hurt me with their words just because I enjoyed Pixels. It actually didn't deserve hatred.7/10P.s. Apologies for short and rushed review. I'm very busy and I chose to review this quickly.</fullReview>

It's an Adam Sandler movie about aliens sending video game monsters to destroy earth with Adam Sandler as the hero and Kevin James as the President. It's not going to be a brilliant study in complex plots and deep characters. It's not meant to be.It's made quite well. The special effects are fun. The jokes are well worn, but still made me (and most of the other people in the cinema) laugh. Yep, there are plot holes bigger than Sydney Harbour, but hey, I'm meant to be believing that aliens took some videos of old video games as a threat. I can overlook the holes.I thought it was fun.

		<fullReview>Aliens intercept a videotape containing recordings of old videogames and interpret it as a declaration of war. They invade Earth and attack with giant versions of classic video game characters. A small group of people who once played those games as kids are earth's only hope.If you remember Ghostbusters, Pixels will seem very familiar ? the same gang of weirdos are up against the enemy, only instead of ghosts we have computer game characters, with Donkey Kong taking centre stage during the final act rather than the Marshmallow Man. The blocky retro video game graphics are nicely realised, even though Wreck-it Ralph did the gag first two years ago.The plot is full of stuff which stretches credibility: Kevin James, playing the familiar Kevin James character, is President of the USA ? oh, really? Josh Gad's Ludlow is halfway between ludicrously gay and ludicrously hetero, with the contradiction never explained, and the way Adam Sandler and Michelle Monaghan are brought together is typical movie artifice.But Pixels is silly movie to start off with, so this doesn't really really matter. Sandler thankfully offers his affable cleverdick character rather than one of his odious "funny voice" characters, and his bickering with Monaghan is played nicely. Peter Dinklage is great, and Brian Cox and Sean Bean both have fun while chewing some scenery.The cinema was almost full, with many kids, and they all enjoyed it. As did I.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When aliens mistake images of 1980s arcade games as a sign of aggression, they attack Earth with evil versions of Pac-Man, Donkey Kong and other video-game characters. In response, the U.S. president asks his old gamer pals to battle the invaders.....I'm one of those rare people who actually like the work of Adam Sandler. Sure, he's made a few Mis-steps in the past couple of years, but despite the fact that he has garnered an unbelievable amount of haters, his films always have at least one bonkers moment.So it's no surprise that this movie would fail, because people would be embarrassed to like the movie, because all the hipsters hate them a bit Adam.Well I most not be hip, because this film gave me what I expected, a fun ninety or so minutes, some funny random moments, Kevin James playing the same role he always does, and Dinkledge stealing the film from everyone.Sandler knows what he's doing, he plays the everyday guy who always gets the girl and always saves the day. It's the predictability of his movies and the movies that Happy Madison produce. He's been doing it for twenty years, so why should he do it any different.The film is basically Ghostbusters, but with video game characters we all know and love as the bad guys. That's the film. We travel to Britain where the depiction of the British is I scenes, but so over the top it's hilarious (I'm British, and it's your stereotypical Hollywood depiction that's been done since the seventies).And then it's back and forth fighting the titular villains until the big finale. Apart from the PAC-MAN sequence, there is nothing new here, the jokes are almost a linear part of a Sandler vehicle, slightly sexist, very moronic, but, they still never fail to make me smile.All in all if you are a fan of Sandler, see it, its nowhere near as bad as what the critics and haters are saying, but then again, in some circles, it's not cool to like films that people disregard before even seeing.I'm glad I'm not in those circles, because I'd miss some brainless fun to make me forget about the stresses of the real world.Man up, and admit you liked it really.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not sure what people are expecting from this movie. It's getting a lot of bad reviews and people seem to be having fun trashing Sandler. I don't know why. He did a respectable job, here. He didn't use an annoying, funny voice, he isn't dressed like a female version of himself, and his character isn't a pathetic loser, like in many of his films.He does a good job portraying his character. Kevin James is likable, as well. They're pretty transparently shooting for a Ghostbusters vibe with this, but, it's forgivable, because it mostly works.This is far from a perfect movie. I can't say I laughed out loud, partially because of the weirdly hostile audience. The folks I was watching the movie with seemed unwilling to give the movie a chance, so I think very few of them enjoyed it. Too bad.Go see it expecting a fun movie, with a flawed plot, great special effects, and reasonably believable characters. Don't expect it to be "Gone With The Wind" and you might have yourself a nice time watching this. It helps if you were about 15 when Donkey Kong and Q-Bert hit the arcades. Or not. Lighten up and have fun with it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have never found any film of Sandler even mildly amusing before but I have to say that with Pixels I constantly laughed out loud, along with my 13 yr son and a cinema full of parents and children, all thoroughly enjoying themselves. yes it is an absurd concept for a film and full of stereotypical characters from the bombastic warmonger, geeks and conspiracy nuts to the usual American concept of British people, but the film knows that the characters are 2D and works to incorporate a huge amount of humour within those characters. The animation fully expresses the world of '80s video games wonderfully. As a previous reviewer stated this film is destined to become a cult classic. Yes it is stupid, pointless, totally unbelievable but at the same time if you aren't smiling inanely and wishing Q-Bert was your own trophy, then there s no hope in you saving the world with your humour or gaming skills.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is not the typical film I would go and watch, the plot didn't draw me in at all. The only reason I decided to view this film was because of the actors; Angela Demo, Barbara McCarthy, Jason Knight and John Buchan certainly done a great job on the casting. I have always been a big fan of Adam Sandler and Ashley Benson so although my opinions may be slightly biased, the film genuinely made me laugh and not many films can do that. The plot is entirely unrealistic but the visuals are interesting and different from anything that is already out there.I really liked the costume design in this movie, the clothing and style gave the characters personality and contributed well to the overall feel of the movie. I loved how the location of film changes, from different cities. The establishing shots helped to set the mood for each scene and kept the film flowing.Even if you are not a fan of this genre of movie and haven't particularly enjoyed Adam Sandler's work in the past then you should watch purely for the soundtrack alone, with music from Queen, even if you hate the film it makes the whole 106 minutes worth it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Chris Columbus and Adam Sandler are two people in the film industry whose movies I grew up with and still enjoy up to today. Columbus gave us Home Alone, Adventures in Babysitting, and Mrs. Doubtfire. Sandler gave us Happy Gilmore, Mr. Deeds, and Big Daddy. Now, they have combined their efforts to give us a new film that also took me back with Pixels.The film begins with adolescent versions of Sam Brenner and Will Cooper, who are checking out the new video game arcade that just opened. There, they also meet and befriend Ludlow Lamonsoff. They all get involved in a huge video game tournament where footage of all the kids playing video games will be sent into outer space. The finals come down to Sam and another kid named Eddie Plant. Eddie beats Sam in a game of Donkey Kong. Years later, they have all lived different lives. Will (Kevin James) has become President of the United States, while Sam (Adam Sandler) has become a tech installer. Ludlow (Josh Gad) has become a conspiracy theorist. Will has called in Sam to look at some footage he has of a military base in Guam, thinking it might have something to do with a video game they played when they were kids. It turns out that the attackers are an alien race who interpreted the video of kids playing video games as a declaration of war. When the military isn't trained for defending the world against video games, it is up to Sam and Ludlow to save the world before their three lives are up.While Adam Sandler is well know for his low brow, goofy characters, this time around he has toned down the goofiness a lot. There is still a little bit of a goofball, but compared to his fellow cast members, his role is a bit more straight. Kevin James as the adult Will Cooper is also in more of straight part. Josh Gad and Peter Dinklage, who plays the adult version of Eddie Plant, have the crazy goofball roles in this one. Both Gad and Dinklage are riots in their parts and you can tell they are having a lot of fun with their roles. Veteran character actor Brian Cox is also a lot of fun in his part as a crusty old admiral who is not particularly happy with how the President is handling the crisis at hand. Michelle Monaghan is also decent as Colonel Violet Van Patten, a single mother with a young son who is also called into action during the crisis.Chris Columbus delivers us a fun film with a lot of references to the old video games such as Donkey Kong, Pac Man, and Centipede. Columbus is having a lot of fun with this, mixing in the action and the comedy, and showing that he still has something for us. Now Columbus did have to go to the different companies who made each video game and get permission to use their characters. But with what he was able to get, he certainly shows respect for the characters and still gives the audience something entertaining.The visual effects are outstanding. I like how the visual effects team made all the video game characters look like they came right out of the machine rather than some new, and improved CGI. With this, it feels more in line with the games from the 80's.Pixels is a fun film for everyone. The kids will get some enjoyment and interest in the story and situations, while the adults will get to see some of their favorite video game characters come alive on screen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Naysayer's beware: If you don't like Adam Sandler and/or 80's cultural references, you are NOT going to like PIXELS. Is this movie masterpiece theater? Far from it. Will it win best picture at the Academy Awards? Highly unlikely. Will if enthrall 40 year olds who grew up with arcade games? Chances are, most will. I just stepped out of the theater and I must confess I enjoy PIXELS very, very much, despite reading the god awful reviews by "film critics" as well as pimp faced IMDb readers. I agree that Adam Sandler's fortunes at the box office have been on a down slide for some years now but then again, he was never that "big" of a draw, like say, Eddie Murphy in his prime. I guess if you try to over analyze any of Sandler's films you're going to wind up seriously depressed. PIXELS is big, dumb fun, full of 80's references (the arcade games, the music, hell, even MTV!). I won't describe the movie because other users have done eloquently so. I'll just stick with my very positive praises for this movie. My daughters, who have nothing to do with 80's culture, both enjoyed the movie a whole lot. True, my kids know most of the games that appear in the movie and see them come to life and interact with real characters was a roller-coaster ride. There's Pacman, Defender, Frogger, Q- Bert, Galaga, Asteroids, Space Invaders and of course, Donkey Kong. Certainly the over 40 crowd out there will enjoy it, but young kids will too.Plus, as a GAME OF THRONES fan, it was a rush seeing Sean Bean and Peter Dinklage in here, and having CHEAP TRICK kicking off the movie is always good in my book!I'm buying this on bluray as soon as it comes out!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Movie was good but ruined by Josh Gad and ending</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was very good. My son and I went to see it together and I identified some of the games. This movie brought back memories some good, some bad. The scene with the girl scouts was typical female in that they started screaming at the President when he corrected one of the girl scouts that was being a brat. The main problems arose with Josh Gad's character when he started screaming like a rabid homo and later at the end when the offspring looked like little Q-berts. Babies with some sort of special abilities (shape changing, etc. like in "Son of the mask") would have been fine but the two humans having baby Q-berts was a stupid. I had actually considered adding this movie to the collection for later viewing when it's released but with Josh Gad's one weird scene and the Q-bert babies I doubt I will get it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Note: I saw the film in standard format not 3D or IMAX. ***Potential spoiler for the ending of the film though I think most readers will already know what that ending is before seeing the movie if readers are in the correct frame of mind to view the film.***I enjoyed this movie! In fact, it surprised me with its depth of themes that I was not expecting from a jaunt down gaming memory lane.Brenner's honest portrayal of male self-respect and leadership and the effect his portrayal has on those around him is strength of character personified and is a robust genuine male role model for young boys and adult men.The arcade scene was a powerful positive statement to which all children of all ages can relate, and, if taken to heart, empowers and liberates children from one of the greatest fears of childhood. The scene was done in a most natural way. It was a showing without the telling which is what excellent story writing is meant to be.I found a richness of human connection in this film that didn't insult my intelligence and was humorous and believable against the backdrop of a fanciful circumstance. Predictable plot? Yes, but genuine enough to bring a smile to the face and enjoy the familiarity of that plot like a favorite amusement park ride that you want to ride over and over again. Some plot holes? Yes, but should one care? Not if one has taken the time to see the movie from the eyes of a child enjoying the fun of the ride over and over again.Should all movies be verbose in development, dark, and complicated with political social undertones to be excellent or good? This is a fun "feel good" kid's movie of pretend play where for once the good guys win, save the world, and get the girl without any shades of gray. It is a wonderful suspension of adult cynicism to return to the creative world of a child's imaginative mind.I don't know the history of Sandler's movies. It seems that most critics dislike his movies. This was the first movie of Sandler's that I saw and it was good wholesome fun on many levels. Maybe that cynicism of Hollywood and the critics is why the world is such a dark scary place for children.We need more men in the world like Sandler's character, Brenner.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Have you been playing Space Invaders a lot? ? Yes, why? ? Because you're invading my space.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After receiving(and misinterpreting it to be a declaration of war) a copy of an arcade game competition from 1982 in a NASA probe, aliens attack the Earth by sending copies of arcade game characters in a winner takes all battle for the planet. When a US military base is attacked, the President of the United States calls his old gamer buddy Brenner(who was at the competition in 1982) to confirm his suspicions that characters from Galaga destroyed the base. Soon enough, the 1982 champions are back together defending the Earth against the alien threat.Pixels is not Wreck it Ralph, but who wanted it to be? Instead it is a bunch of crazy alien invasion fun with a heavy helping of 1980's nostalgia. Peter Dinklage is surprisingly funny as a comic foil, and the rest of the cast are good in their roles. Good but not great direction from Chris Columbus and a funny script. As for the 3D, while it had proper depth, it didn't add too much, but the alien scenes(which account for about a third of the film) did benefit from it.Despite the fact the Adam Sandler is in this, it's one of Mr. Sandler's better films of late. Not one of the best comedies of 2015, but very far from the worst. Pixels is an entertaining silly comedy, and worth your time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I will admit that I was not sold by the trailer for this movie. It came off as one of those movies that was a crap shoot if it was going to be a good watch or a stinker.I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised when I found out how good it was. The story line was amusing and funny. The performances of the cast were spot on. The humor was tastefully done so that the parents will get some good laughs while the kids are laughing more at what is going on then what was being said.This is one movie that I would not mind going to see again while it is in the theaters should the chance come up. And I will certainly be adding it to my DVD library soon as it is released.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not bad at all</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being an old school gamer of the 80s myself, I did enjoy the movie and there were a few funny moments. My wife even cried a bit a couple of times, and my 5+ y.o. son was frightened a couple of times, too :) For modern kids some of the scenes would require a bit of explanation, but my son is familiar with the most big titles of the 80s, so the movie was entertaining for him as well. I'm not too demanding on the plot part, I'm happy that such "bitxploitation" movies are filmed at all. The beginning was especially promising and made me a bit sentimental. Overall, pretty good work. Not sure why it has got so many negative reviews.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I 1st heard about Pixels, I was pumped &amp; couldn't wait to see it.Now after finally watching it, Major, MAJOR disappointment.After seeing Kevin James was the president (Seriously?) the movie just went straight downhill from there.I just felt like as it went along, it just got more &amp; more &amp; more boring.The only good thing about Pixels was seeing all the old video game characters, remembering the old video games I use to play &amp; the 1's I didn't recognize, trying to figure out what games they were from.God, this movie stunk.I can't think of enough bad things to say about it.If somebody told me to come up with 1 funny moment from the movie, I'd say the scene where the lady is in her closet, crying over husband, drinking wine from a sippy cup &amp; Adam Sandler walks in.Other than that, nothing.If you're thinking of watching Pixels, I'd tell you to skip this movie &amp; find something better to do with your time</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The makers of this movie tried hard to be funny.. so they threw in a dwarf in the movie and hoped that the audience would laugh at the dwarf... so distasteful. Why is it always that these ass-holes think that making fun of dwarfs and other vulnerable people is so fun? Then they take this dwarf and use him throughout this movie - from the beginning to the end - in the hope of making the audience laugh, but all they did was to make a fool out of themselves. Disgusting! In short, this movie is offensive and filled with black humour.Beside the dwarf clown, all characters in this movie are highly likable. And the visual effects are also good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Vintage video games attack earth!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A video of vintage video games are sent into outer space in 1982. Aliens believe it is an act of war, so they challenge the earth to classic video games in 2015. If the earth doesn't win within 3 lives, the aliens will destroy the earth. It is up to the hero of the story to play the real life video games to save the planet. I liked this movie. It was light hearted and fun. I don't know that I'll go back for another viewing, but I could see where a family with young teens might. I used to play all of the video games that were presented in the movie, so it was very nostalgic for me. I'm not sure the teenage crowd, that should be the target for this movie, will get all the references? Although I laughed here and there, it isn't the level of comedy I've come to expect from Adam Sandler. With that said, it was worth renting and I hope it makes it to Netflix or Amazon Prime, but I think it will get pulled into the Cable channel lineup.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Loved the video game concept but the rest of the film was a let down. 4/10</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Review: Adam Sandler always seems to star in these mediocre movies which make millions of dollars at the box office. This movie had a really good concept, in terms of using the old video games, which I personally grew up with, but the rest of the plot is far fetched and quite silly. Having Kevin James as the president was a bad choice but there was a couple of funny moments, especially with the little orange character, Q'Bert. Anyway, the movie starts of with a young Brenner (Adam Sandler), Cooper (Kevin James) and Ludlow (Josh Gad), playing video games in a amusement park. Brenner then enters the 1982 Worldwide Video Arcade Championships which also has the Guinness Book of Records attending, along with Nasa who will be recording the nights events so they can send a probe into the solar system, hoping that it can connect to extraterrestrial life. REALLY! Anyway, Brenner has to beat Eddie "The Fire Blaster" (Peter Dinklage) to become champion but he fails to beat him at Donkey Kong so he has to make do with second place. The movie then switches to the present day, we're Brenner is a mobile electrician and Cooper is the president of the United States. When an army unit gets attacked by a mysterious spaceship, which turns out to be from the game Galaga, the president turns to his best friend Brenner to try and work out a method to sort out the problem, as he had a talent when it came to the old video games. There other close friend, Ludlow, works out that the Aliens took the video tape, that was sent to them from Nasa, as a declaration of war and as the tape was sent to them in video game format, they were sending video game characters to destroy earth. They also give earth 3 life's, like any ordinary video game at that time, so the first one with 3 wins would win there destructive game. Anyway, they turn to the Fire Blaster to help them save earth and the humans that they have taken as a reward. They also get help from Violet (Michelle Monaghan), who works for the president and Q'Bert who was a gift from the Aliens because they won a couple of there matches. This movie could have really worked if it was taken seriously. The film company was lucky to get the rights to use so many of the old video game classics but the director didn't take full advantage of the opportunity. The silly jokes throughout the movie, we're really poor and the corny ending really let the movie down. With that aside, I did stick with the movie because I didn't know what direction the director was going to take the whole video game element of the film. I liked the Pac-Man game with the cars and the Donkey Kong game looked pretty impressive but I just couldn't take the childish humour, which is in many of Adam Sandler movies nowadays. Watchable, because of the arcade game content!Round-Up: This movie was directed by Chris Columbus, 57, who brought you some all time classics like Home Alone I &amp; II, Mrs. Doubtfire, Nine Months, Stepmom, the great Bicentennial Man, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets and Percy Jackson &amp; the Lightning Thief. He's got quite an impressive portfolio, which is why he was given this hard project to direct. Visually, he did do a great job in terms of making it look real and as he didn't write the script, I can't blame him for the silly storyline. I'm slowly beginning to dislike Adam Sandler, 49, movies because his latest films have been pretty poor. I haven't seen the Cobbler yet but I wasn't impressed with Grown Ups 2, That's My Boy, Just Go With It or the awful Jack &amp; Jill. Blended was watchable, mainly because of the scenes with Terry Crews, who he teams up with again in the upcoming Ridiculous 6, which also stars some top class comedians. Anyway, there's no rumours about a sequel for this movie so I would like to see a serious director take on a fresh movie with this old video game concept.Budget: $88million Worldwide Gross: $244millionI recommend this movie to people who are into their action/sci-fi/comedies starring Adam Sandler, Kevin James, Michelle Monaghan, Peter Dinklage, Josh Gad, Brian Cox, Sean Bean and Dan Aykroyd. 4/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You know, I have always been a fan of Characters in movies rather than the story of one. I often feel that if a story is rather bland, that if it has some really strong, well developed characters the could still go far. Unfortunately with all of Sandlers movies of late, the characters are the same stereotype. They are either A: 40 year old trying to regain their youth while trying to live through their children, or they have unbelievable talents/careers.Its one thing to try and have me believe that Adam Sandler is on some type of nerd squad, but to have a movie where Kevin James character becomes the President? With no explanation? Its a shame because the pix elated video game characters do have a nice look to them unfortunately they have to be in an Happy Madison Production. While not being nearly as offensive as Jack and Jill was, Sandler manages to almost ruin all of these classic video game characters. Not to mention Q-Bert, poor, poor Q-Bert, What he did to deserve this I'll never know</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good comedy with Adam Sandler is possible</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the 80's Sam Brenner (Adam Sandler) is one of the best arcade gamer.Pac-Man,Donkey Kong,Centipede, have no secrets for him. He is the best but not for any longer... One day, he lost a contest against Eddie Plant (Peter Dinklage) and the game is over. A few years later,aliens looking like the arcade games declare the war against the USA...I think that this movie is very hilarious and it is the best recipe to have a good time with your family. The movie is a pearl for the passionate about retro gaming because it brings back many memories. The story is kind of absurd and totally assumed, it is not a complex or spiritual movie just a crazy movie about aliens and games. The cast is not perfect, Adam Sandler is the main character but, it is eventually the only good comedy with him. The special effects are funny and create an impress of reality through the virtual world.Personally, I recommend this comedy if you want two hours of laughing.</fullReview>

Adam Sandler has, in my view, the potential to be a great actor... ...That said, PIXELS is NOT him showing that he has that potential - Adam Sandler is Adam Sandler!!! If you have seen any Sandler movie before, you know exactly what you are going to get...And alongside him are all his old SNL Buddies which does not help people who review this movie as its all been done before.Kevin James as President Cooper should rightly get the WORST casting role... But actually he is not so bad.That Credit has to go to Peter Dinklage, Which is actually rather unfair - Dinklage acts brilliantly! Its just his character is so over the top and poorly written... And in all honesty, had ANYONE ELSE been given his role - They would have failed miserably...Much as his character is really poor... He manages to save it and you actually end up liking the piece of (Censored!)So, Yeah! The film is a typical Sandler-Fest... But honestly, its not as bad as many reviewers are making out.Yes there are some damn serious plot-holes... People like to argue about the Death Star Exhaust Port but trust me that has nothing on this film!!! (And if you still think that the Death Star Exhaust Port is a Plot Hole in Star Wars - Look for Dorkly on YouTube and see why its not!!!)Effects are great, the story is kind of fun, and it has some great elements of humour...But not a film for the kids... Sorry! It may look all harmless and fun but some of the content is pretty near the knuckle at times, so unless you are OK with your kids swearing - Give it a miss!Its not Sandlers greatest film ever... But more enjoyable than many give it credit for.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So, we decided to rent a film for our 11 year old sons birthday and it was this that he chose to watch. I decided to ignore the poor rating on IMDb and go for it anyway which proved to be a terrible mistake!! So we watched this film for around 1 hour and then all (Me, my girlfriend and our son) of us decided it was a complete waste of 1 hour of our lives (not to mention the ?4.50 rental charge!) so had to turn it off. None of the comedy was funny to either us or the child, as the obvious jokes were being cracked on screen we were all looking at each other in disbelief at how cheesy and how much of a lack of effort was put into the writing of this film! Needless to say i will not be recommending this film to anyone, EVER!! I read some reviews on here after watching the film for the 1 hour that we survived and was expecting to find endless 1 star reviews and was so amazed that there was loads of 10 star ratings!!! I can't believe all these people were watching the same films as myself! Usually I do like Adam Sandler films (mainly the older ones).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a waste</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Aliens attack the earth, but this time their weapons of choice are classic retro games characters.The movie stars Adam Sandler, Peter Dinklage and Kevin James along with tons of other known actors and some high profile cameos. But aside from maybe Peter Dinklage, none of them worked. Lazy acting or over the top. Also, I really don't get what was the point of adding the LAME ASS romance in this movie. It was so cringe worthy and waste of time. Michelle Monaghan was just there to look pretty.The special effects, all the retro characters brought to life, were pretty good. The pix-elation effects looked nice. Also, there were some, very few, scenes which actually were fun. Like defeating donkey Kong while 'We will rock you' is being played. Now this is the kinda stuff the movie should have focused on.Other than that, the movie was just filled with mediocrity. The jokes never worked, the situations never worked and had so much cringe worthy stuff, and the cheese level was through the roof.Man, I was so looking forward to watching this movie. It had the potential to be so much fun and be really successful. It could have easily tapped the nostalgic centers of millions of gamers who were around when games like Pac Man, Donkey Kong, Mario etc were the big thing. And it had a relatively high budget. I just can't believe how they f***** it up. SUCH A WASTE!!5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun Movie that will leave Kids and Adults Entertained,</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pixels is a good movie with a well written storyline and a terrific comedic cast. It's a very fun movie that does something that most films aimed at families fail to do, it's funny for both kids and adults, I watched this in the theatre and I couldn't help noticing that there was just as much laughter from the older audience as there was children, it has a ton of classic 80's video game characters, such as Pac-Man, Donkey Kong and Q*bert, and it's a delight for all ages to see all these classic characters in one movie whether you're familiar with them or not. It certainly has its flaws, my biggest issue is that the trailer spoiled too much of the movie, it shows every single battle (that being three) as well as basically every video game character that appears in this, it should have had much more, it was clearly given creative freedom by Sony to use as many as they could and I don't think they took advantage of that as much as they should have, there should have been more characters other than Q*bert to be used for cute comic relief, and I think there should have been a few more battles between the humans and the classic games as well. This film is receiving way too much criticism that I don't think it deserves, it isn't perfect and it dosen't make as much use of its creative and original plot as it could have, but the reviews for this are brutal and I don't understand why, I think critics just assume that an Adam Sandler film is always going to be terrible, and when that's your attitude and you're going in to all his films with extremely low expectations, then of course you won't like it, critics don't seem to look at Pixels for the fun and harmless adventure it is, and I actually found Sandler to be quite charming in it, the kind of comedic performance I like from him, subtle and realistic, and because of these reviews Pixels became the most underrated movie of the summer. Though it certainly has its imperfections, Piixels is a very fun movie that had me entertained and sucked in to this world of pure imagination from start to finish, I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good family film that children and adults will enjoy. A group of hardcore gamers must battle aliens who have come to attack Earth in the form of classic 80's video game characters. Best Performance: Josh Gad Worst Performance: Brian Cox</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's so much fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film tells the story of a arcade gaming enthusiast who has not achieve much in his life. His big break comes when he is recruited to help save the world against video game characters invading the Earth.I wish I watched "Pixels" earlier because I thoroughly enjoyed it! The story is really fun because it is something e that is extremely unlikely to happen, but we can all relate to it because we all played pacman before! The evil characters, meaning the video game characters, are all do cute and colourful, that I actually look forward to seeing more of. Seeing all the characters in full force in the end is fun. The jokes are funny, and made me laugh out loud on many occasions. The two female cameos are really funny too!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>PIXELS : This is a movie that will become too close to the souls of all those people who played the 80s and 90s games.... This indeed is a great movie for the classic game lovers...!!! Pixels is a visual treat to all the fans of Pac Man,,, Space Invaders,, Galaga,, Araknoid,, Centipede,, Donkey Kong and many other great games...!! Playing all those games during my childhood,, I always dreamed myself to be a part of them.. And Pixels brought that dream to the screen...!! I just spent 2 best hours of fun time...!!! About the movie : This is one of the best and very innovative plots I've seen in the recent times...!! Given such a great plot,, they ended up making a mediocre movie... But still the movie connects to you and tickles you if you are fan of those games...!! Adam Sandler is funny as usual...!! After a long time,, I'm happy that he's back..!! Peter Dinklage is awesome as usual...!! Visuals and background score too good...!! Overall : A must watch movie for all game lovers...!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Beware world, because your favorite video games are out to get you! Or at least in Adam Sandler's new film they are. Pixels begins with a throwback where we see teenagers Sam Brenner, Will Cooper, Ludlow Lamonsoff and Eddie 'The Fire Blaster' Plant (the adult versions are played by Adam Sandler, Kevin James, Josh Gad and Peter Dinklage respectively) saving the world umpteen times in video game arcades!The story then forwards to the present where Brenner works in a tech-support job while his best friend Cooper is now the President of the United States. The two are still best friends though. The twist in the tale arrives when intergalactic aliens receive feeds of classic video games and misconstrue them as an avowal of war, thus attacking Earth using classic video game characters as weapons! With the threat of war on their heads, Cooper rounds up the boys to save the world from Pacman, Centipede, Donkey Kong and more. The boys are also assisted by Lt. Col Violet Van Patten (Michelle Monaghan) in their quest to save the world and how they do it is what forms the rest of the story.Let me start by saying that Adam Sandler plays the lovable loser yet again; a role he has truly done to death. Everything from his outfits to his demeanor are exactly like they were in practically the last 20 movies he's done. So basically, you can just pick Adam Sandler out of 'Just Go With It' or 'Grown Ups', and put him in this one and you won't be able to tell the difference. It's been a while since Sandler's tried something different and it would be nice to see him in a different role for a change.This is Sandler's own production so you will see the usual suspects in supporting roles. Peter Dinklage was awesome as the cocky Eddie Plant while it was a pleasant change to see Kevin James in the role of the President! Josh Gad and Michelle Monaghan were good too. I quite liked the story and the film keeps you entertained throughout. The highlight for me though was seeing all those classic video games come to life and how! Everything from the CGI to the "acting" was top-notch when it came to the games.All in all, Pixels is a fun watch and you definitely won't be able to resist watching your favorite games come to life on the big screen! Go for it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun 80s nostalgia</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So many people seemed determined to hate this movie before it was even released. I think it was mostly those who dislike Adam Sandler. Both the hate towards this movie and towards Adam Sandler are undeserved. Sandler has made some flops (Little Nicky, Jack &amp; Jill), but he was also responsible for some comedy classics (Billy Madison, Happy Gilmore, The Wedding Singer) and has shown that he's capable of more serious roles as well (Spanglish, Funny People). As far as Adam Sandler in this movie goes, it falls somewhere in the middle. Far removed from either his worst or his best roles. He wasn't the primary reason I enjoyed the movie, but he took nothing away from my enjoyment either. And perhaps that's how it should be. I don't remember feeling like I was being reminded that I was watching an Adam Sandler flick.We all know this movie was not intended as fine art and it's almost cliché to point that out when reviewing light-hearted comedies. The point is, I had a good time watching. The short Internet clip that inspired this movie was incredible, and seeing the idea expanded on was good fun. It won't change your life, but it will transport you back to 80s and give you some fun eye candy. One thing of note: I usually get to bored by long, drawn-out CGI action sequences, especially during climaxes. This is the first movie in a long time that had such a sequence during the climax that actually entertained me, and I think that means a lot. For me the movie would have been better had it's intended audience been adults. Some of the attempts at "double entendre" humour (i.e: jokes intended to entertain the adults yet be "safe" for kids) fell flat for me. But I understand that they wanted to make a family friendly movie, and that's what they did. Peter Dinklage was comedy gold. If you like video games and Game of Thrones it's worth seeing just for those two things alone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Greetings from Lithuania."Pixels" (2015) is not the smartest movie around to say the least, but it is strangely fun film. The performances are OK for this material, while the story is ... you have to see it to believe it. The are some funny moments here, but to enjoy this movie you have to turn your brains off first and watch it with your friends and use some alcohol first - then it will definitely will be an enjoyable flick.Overall, "Pixels" is exactly how it sounds - ludicrous and mindless fun. You can enjoy this movie once, but there isn't anything to return for a second viewing. Ever.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>PIXELS review by Mike Smith When aliens misinterpret video feeds of classic arcade games as a declaration of war, they attack the Earth in the form of a video games.I could not wait to see this movie, but I liked PIXELS in a whole different way. The movie doesn't have a lot of hard laughs and every time there was an opportunity for one, it dropped the ball. That being said there are lots of chuckles.The cast works really well together but that's not a shock because most of them are part of the Happy Madison family. PIXELS doesn't really pick up until we see Josh Gad. Adam Sandler may be the star of the film but all the best lines and funny parts are given to Josh Gad and Peter Dinklage. Also, keep your eyes open for Dan Aykroyd and the product placement of his crystal head vodka.PIXELS has a nice blend of light laughs, romance, sci-fi, gun action and car action. The film moves at a nice pace and it goes by fast. This film is fun for the whole family, young and old; the music is a 80s greatest hits soundtrack and really ties the film together.The c.g is fun, cute and really well done... One thing that bugged me the first time I watched PIXELS was that Q-Burt could talk. But then after the 2nd viewing, I figured that he is an alien not the real game character and he is a big part of the movie so he has to speak. Another thing that PIXELS does is point out the generation gap, but as someone who plays a lot of classic arcade games, I'm shocked that some kids don't know about arcades. Hopefully this film will make younger kids want to find and play arcade classics.I'm so happy about this film, I was hoping for big laughs and even though there weren't any, it wasn't a let down. The story was good, the action was fun and it was awesome seeing my favorite classic arcade games come to life in the real world. Cheers and remember life won't suck as long as there is a good movie to watch 8 out of 10 edited by Samantha Locke twitter: @FatMikeTPK Facebook Page: https://www.facebook.com/FatMikesMovieReviews</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>On the off chance I see this movie... I'm glad I did!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off... I dislike Adam Sandler movies since the wedding singer. As an actor, he has a very negative and annoying screen presence. I read reviews of this film and it got slated.. I mean I think critics rated human centipede more and my god I was dreading seeing it but my boy wanted to see it and I thought 'why deny him because I think it's going to be dreadful!'.... apart from sandlers lazy acting and same personality as all films this movie was great! The effects even got completely dismissed by so called critics!! They were beautiful... the best you can do with graphics this day and age in regards to pixels! There was stereotyping... typical "America saves the world again!!" And some silly gags... bit it was enough to keep me entertained. There is simply a firing squad out for Sandler and I'm starting to feel a little sorry for him as I was one of them, this film was a gamble in my eyes and it should have paid off. CRITICS ARE NOT ALWAYS RIGHT!! I have learned that now so shame on me! Go and see it... for those that are saying this is the worst film EVER, have you not seen house of the dead??? Human centipede 1, 2 or 3????</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having been a teenager/20s person in the 80s, I was VERY familiar with all the games used in this film so I thought it was great fun. I suppose though, that if one has no history with these games, it may not be so for everyone - but the special effects were VERY well done and the acting was just fine. Yes, even Adam Sandler. Although it's true that some of the jokes fell flat that can be said of many, many films, so I won't hold that against it. I enjoyed it, and would watch it again so please don't believe all the anti-hype and go see it for yourself. Personally, I like and own several A.S. films. Not all of them but a fair amount, and I find them to be very funny.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Due to all the hating and criticism this film was getting I was so disappointed because I was so excited for the movie but when I watched tonight I was blown away. Igore what the criticizing idiots who think this is not comedy because I and all the crowd could not stop laughing and we all loved it. Great special effects, great comedy, great action and arguably most importantly great cast. Everyone saying this should be slowly beat to death or burned or whatever take a step back and realize what this is and who made it. It's a comedy by Adam Sandler so if you don't like his comedy don't watch the movies, simples. But those who do you will greatly enjoy the movie. A few things to point out however, there are some plot holes ie why the aliens want to attack the planet, I know it says about the probe but why though, and why do they give the humans chances instead of going full out. I mean if you are so advanced to create PAC-MAN, Centipede and Donkey Kong as well as personal favorite Charchter Qbert then why give us chances, but all that aside it is a great movie and would highly recommend it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The immense hate for "Pixels" has me asking a serious question for those who hate the film, did you hate the concept or did you simply find yourself refusing any inkling of positivity or humor whilst watching the film upon seeing Adam Sandler as the top-billed actor? I ask this question as somebody who finds myself at odds with Sandler on most of his projects, but also somebody willing to admit his achievements and provide him with credit when he deserves it.I ask this because it seems the good majority of the public, and critics for that matter, have given up on Adam Sandler, ostensibly just waiting to hate the next project he's working on before it's even released. The negative buzz around "Pixels," similar to "Blended," Sandler's last feature, started early and never let up. While Sandler has given himself plenty of reasons (and films, for that matter) to dislike him and his work, I feel under the work of any other actor besides Sandler and his production company, "Pixels" would've at least garnered a handful of defenders."Pixels" is a brazenly silly sound and lights show, one that works predominately because of its willingness to exhaust its premise and use many actors with differing personalities to carry the entire show. That, right there, is about all I can say for the film: it's cheeky, it's relentlessly goofy, but it's also just funny enough and adventurous enough to recommend to anyone searching for that piece of entertainment in the cool multiplexes during this hot summer.The film opens with Sam Brenner and Will Cooper, two best friends who spend their days at the arcade, where Sam discovers his incredible skill for video games. Will encourages him to compete in the first video game championship of 1982, which will be recorded and sent into space by NASA, along with other artifacts. At the tournament, however, Sam winds up losing to Eddie Plant (Peter Dinklage), a cocky, professional video gamer.Decades later, Sam (Adam Sandler) works as an installer of software and his pal Will (Kevin James) goes on to be The President of the United States, still both very close friends despite their difference in power. One day, Will calls Sam into the office to observe an attack on a military base in Guam by what looks to be the video game pixels and characters from the arcade game Galaga. Baffled by the insanity of this possibility, Sam reconnects with Ludlow Lamonsoff (Josh Gad), a pudgy conspiracy theorist whom he met at at the video game tournament back in the 1980's. Ludlow shows Sam a video claiming to be sent from aliens that the video tape of the tournament was seen as a declaration of war, prompting the aliens to send the video game characters from classic arcade games to attack the world. The world gets "three lives," so to speak, which are lost if one particular battle (video game) is lost. Three lost battles and the Earth is terminated.Desperate and out of options, Will orders Sam, Ludlow, Eddie, and his unique weapons specialist Lieutenant Colonel Violent van Patten (Michell Monaghan) to fight the pixelated monsters, which come in the form of Centipede, Pac-Man, and eventually Donkey Kong.It shouldn't take more than a minute of watching the trailer for "Pixels" to decide if you'd want to see something like this. Those who do, if they view the film as the basic summer entertainment that the film is trying to be, will find a perfectly acceptable and balanced dose of fun. "Pixels" also works as a showcase for a divisive array of talent. We have Sandler, who is surprisingly very relaxed and nonchalant throughout the whole film, James, who is toned down several notches from his usual self as well, Gad, who bears the same kind of energy Sandler did in his heyday, only with much more personality, and Dinklage, who's narcissism and brazen attitude effectively make his character.Finally, "Pixels" works because it doesn't take itself too seriously; it knows exactly what it needs to do to succeed and that is to be a nonstop display of action with a great visual scheme and characters that are at least somewhat fun to be around. This may not be a showstopper of a film, but it's something that definitely caters to a season of films where numerous other, lesser films find themselves being defended while "Pixels" sits and suffers in a "guilt by association" manner.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun for kids age 9, 15, and 51</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have a 9 year old daughter and a 15 year old son, and it's always difficult finding movies that I can take both of them to. My son, like most young teenage boys, likes the action thrillers. My daughter likes anything cartoony and cute. They both LOVED this movie! There was some humor that seemed aimed right at the 9 year old (...that the 15 year old didn't find funny), and there was other humor that seemed aimed right at the 15 year old (...that the 9 year old didn't understand). The violence was mild enough that it did not frighten my daughter at all. This old 51-year old even got a few grins out of it. Although it's no masterpiece, it's a fun summer movie that everyone in the family can enjoy. Nothing stupendously original, but a very pleasant way to spend a summer afternoon with the kids.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went to see this movie because it was a good show time, amidst a toss up of 4 movies, and in spite of the reviews. What a surprise! I laughed throughout.Yes, the writing could have been better, most of the characters were not believable (with the notable exception of the Wonder Kid who was very believable!), and some of the acting did appear somewhat stiff. I didn't think it detracted too much from the movie, as this is a silly movie. I think why I didn't mind the minor faults was that the movie was quick to point out some of them and make fun of itself. This is not a movie to take seriously, just like almost all of Sandler's previous ones. It is fun, the special effects are great, and it was entertaining.</fullReview>

Whoever hasn't see this should take this a look, it's a really fun action film!I never was disappointed or bothered that the video game characters were taking over earth because really, they added so much effect which is exciting even if it's meant to be scary.

It's different from most Adam Sandler movies as it have heavy CGI but still had some solid laughs. It had some real good 1980s moments as the aliens not only used arcade games but when sending messages had clips of various 80s icons providing their message which added some funny moments. Like most Adam Sandler movies there was some interesting casting. I loved seeing Brian Cox and Sean Bean in a few scenes together bringing back memories of "Sharpe's Eagle". There was also a nice cameo from Serena Williams. The CGI was great and it was pretty original, not a rehash of the aliens blowing things up. I will definitely see it again.</fullReview>

I let my children play all the old arcade games before they saw the movie (except centipede) and they were so excited to see all there heroes in a live action movie. I took my six year old to the movie and she's still talking about it. My three year old was good most of the movie where there were live-action sequences with Pac-man and stuff (which was about half the movie) and couldn't take his eyes off the scree but got bored during talking scenes. I went into the movie expecting an Adam Sandler Movie. I came out satisfied and laughing move of the movie. Don't go in with Super High Expectations that there will be this glamorous storyline and you won't leave disappointed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The 10 star review is a bit extreme, but with such hostility acting towards such a decent entertaining film it's all I got to hit back with.This film exceeds expectations and delivers on not only laughs but entertainment and some of the best 3D effects I've seen in a long while.A more honest star rating would be 7.5 out of 10. Not every joke hits, but most of them do.Sandler is great. Need I remind you, the original Sandler crew doesn't make an appearance other than Kevin James (who's hilarious). Instead we get a delightful Josh Gad? and Peter Dinklage who both deliver.Michelle Monasdhghananaa is terrific and is always a great choice if you want your female character to have more than looks to fill the role. (She even delivers some kick ass moves at the end).The soundtrack is awesome and the plot works because it is so frikkin simple. Avengers 2 put me to sleep this summer, PIXELS woke me up.Enjoy the show.</fullReview>

When the going gets tough, the nation has to turn to the nerds as an alien race attacks the Earth with warriors based on old arcade games. A ship was sent out to contact other races in the 1980's, and what was meant as a peace gesture was interpreted as a threat. I found some of Sandler's recent movies not as funny, but to me this one puts him right back in the comedy driver's seat. All the supporting characters are right, including Dinklage as Sandler's old arcade nemesis. Ignore the other reviews and go and enjoy enjoy enjoy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In 1982 in the hopes of establishing peaceful communication with extraterrestrial life, NASA launches a time capsule into outer space containing images and footage of Earth life and culture. However, the aliens misinterpret enclosed video-feeds of classic arcade games as a declaration of war. They attack the Earth using the games as models for their various assaults including Pac-Man, Donkey Kong, Centipede, Space Invaders, Arkanoid and Tetris. Their technology creates voxels that change form and are capable of turning any form of matter into more of itself. President Will Cooper (Kevin James) calls upon his best friend since childhood, former video game professional Sam Brenner (Adam Sandler), who is now a home theater installer and had a previous relationship with Cooper's wife (Jane Krakowski). To combat the video game characters, Brenner decides to lead a team of retrogamers Eddie Plant (Peter Dinklage) and Ludlow Lamonsoff (Josh Gad) to defeat the aliens with technology similar to those used in games.Pixels is a great 2015 American science fiction comedy film all people must see. Ignore the brainwashed haters who are reviewing this movie without even seeing it. See it on my own responsibility,satisfaction guaranteed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pixels (UGH!)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first heard about the movie Pixels, I was thrilled that I wanted to go see it. However, it turned out to be a big mistake. I was squirming and groaning in my seat as I was 20 minutes into the movie. The acting is terrible and it tries too hard to be funny. "Don't tell anybody I killed a Smurf." I'm confused! How is this a joke? Am I supposed to be laughing out loud at this dialogue? The premise is unoriginal and lazy. Why would video-game characters try to take over the Earth? (I wonder how Pinky and the Brain would react when they read the plot summary of this vile film...) Anyway, it is basically "Ghostbusters meets Wreck-It-Ralph". The writer(s)probably combined both of these films into a gooey, messed-up disaster. To add icing onto the cake, it is a film made by Happy Madison Productions, which is owned by Adam Sandler! I know that he has acted in some worse films, but none of them can surpass Pixels! In addition to the poor writing and horrible acting, it also has terrible morals. For example, the film teaches to its 8-12 year old demographic that it's acceptable to swear in public and drink alcohol. The movie also tells children that it is okay to look at pornographic images. Why would they add in some alcohol, explicit dialogue, and pornographic images into a children's film? I don't know about you, but I think the director might have gotten (clears throat) personal gratification from the content that was displayed.As you probably noticed, the pixels of the video game characters are positively vibrant and eye-catching. I don't know if it's the Computer-Generated Imagery or the lighting, but the video game characters are absolutely gorgeous! Q-Bert looks like he's ready for a spot on The Tyra Banks Show. If the acting wasn't so horrendous, the premise was original, and there were good morals, I would've given this film a pass. Personally, I would give Pixels a skip if you know what's good for you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was just simply bad. So much so that its just common knowledge. And yet, I'm rolling through IMDb reading funny reviews of bad movies and I realize that this one has a strange amount of just... Praise. It seems that a lot of people born in the 80's (the word for it is target audience) rank this really high because "Adam Sandler is funny and there's video game characters in it" Go see the movie, make your own assessment but really, I refuse to believe that anyone reviewing this as positive isn't underage or just plain stupid. Go into it knowing you're seeing a horrid film. Kevin James isn't funny, Adam Sandler isn't funny. again, this is common knowledge at this point even. If you were born in the 80's and you legitimately like this movie I have the sneaking suspicion that you're lying because at this point a lot of people born in the 80's are closing in on 40 years old, and you'd think adults would have more sense than to just get all giddy over something that has characters from other things they like in it.

However, after throwing down the toilet a whole 106 minutes of my life just to endure Pixels' exhaustingly diabolical 'acting', 'comedy wit', and story line (as well as the forewarned painful knowledge both Kevin James AND Adam Sandler are in this) I have came to conclusion that life is honestly just not worth living any more. Watching this has led me to forgive all the kids at primary school who bullied me for playing video games; the 'nerd' characters in this are abysmally written and will cause a spontaneous lobotomy. Be warned.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It was....merely OK</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was excited to hear about this movie, the premise seemed great and the BluRay was a certainty if it even barely met my expectations. Any nod to 80s arcade icons should have been a win for me, sadly, it failed to impress.I think my main problem with the movie was it so geared towards kids, which i kind of get, but it was done to the point were it was just annoying. I really wanted Qbert to die, which is a sad thing to say.It could have been a hilarious movie, but the humor was cheesy and contrived. Again I get make it funny for the kids, but I think the adults who remember these games and the era would have appreciated a few more amusing jokes that they can relate to more.Saying that, it did look fantastic, great CGI, the acting was fine, and generally it was an OK watch, it just could have been so much more, its sad it didn't quite get there.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dumb, dull at points, but a fun novelty that arcade gamers can enjoy!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pixels is the latest film that comedy bore Adam Sandler has stuck his nose into. This movie is a homage/cash in on arcade gamers sweet memories. When NASA send a message into space containing examples of 80's pop culture in hope of contacting alien life, the aliens that discover it mistake the message as a declaration of war. They retaliate by sending real life video game icons of old (Pac-Man, Centipede, Tetris, Pong, Galaga etc.) to destroy the world. When the military fail, the president has no choice but to call in his nerdy friends of old to use their gaming know how to defeat the alien forces.The premise of the movie is pretty unique, and actually pretty good. The plot however, leaves little to be desired. I won't spoil it here, but it is anything but impressive. The video game theme actually saves the movie, and the jokes, while dull and unoriginal for the most part, do make you laugh from time to time. The CGI, is just CGI but the visual style with the pixelated effect is very unique and makes the movie way more enjoyable to watch! The action sequences are well directed and better yet actually follow the arcade game rules! The biggest pro of the film is that it is true to its source material. When you fight the games, you fight by the rules. Video game cheat codes even play a pivotal role in the plot, which is pretty funOverall, Pixels is not an objectively good movie by any stretch of the imagination, with predictable comedy, sub-par plot and cliché characters. However, the premise saves the film from falling flat on its face. The video game sequences are what you are paying to see and when they happen, yeah, they're bloody great, and these scenes bring the funniest moments to the movie for the most part! Top it off with a few decent quips and Peter Dinklage playing the only fun character and you've got a film that isn't great, but is fun enough for arcade gamers to enjoy. You'll be awash in a sea of nostalgia!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Pixels" is the most fun I've had at the movies in a long time!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first read about the premise of the movie "Pixels" (PG-13, 1:45) ? early 1980s video arcade games coming "to life" and attacking the earth ? I thought that it was a really original and fun idea. The feature film is based on an award-winning 2010 French short film of the same name, which simply shows some of these 8-bit game images and characters emanating from an old television set and turning objects and buildings into pixelated versions of themselves. (The short film is only about 2 ? minutes long and is available on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aUnyUrA34bQ.) I felt that expanding this simple idea into a feature-length science fiction action comedy was brilliant and held a lot of potential. Then I learned that the movie starred Adam Sandler and Kevin James whose last few films haven't exactly been their best. Yet, I still hoped that this movie would signal a return to form for those two talented and accomplished comic actors and also that the filmmakers wouldn't screw up what could be a very cool movie. So, was my optimism justified? In my opinion, yes! That's right, folks. It is, of course, my opinion (although not "just" mine, as I'll explain later), but I really think that this is one of those times to ignore the professional critics and listen to a fellow Movie Fan. "Pixels" is terrific! Sandler is Sam Brenner, an erstwhile nationally-ranked arcade gamer who hasn't done much with his life since his success in the first National Arcade Game Championship in 1982. He now works for "Nerd Brigade" (a fictionalized version of companies like "Geek Squad") and he still hangs out with Will Cooper (James), his best friend from back in the day. (Although it's revealed very early in the film, I won't tell you what Will does for a living in the present because finding out is a real hoot!) When earth comes under alien attack (meaning alien, as in outer space ? don't be frightened, Mr. Trump), in order to save the world as only they can, Sam and Will reunite with other former "arcaders", Ludlow Lamonsoff (Josh Gad), who? "lacks the social skills" and is obsessed with conspiracy theories, along with Eddie Plant (Peter Dinklage), who is over-the-top arrogant and of questionable moral fiber.Video footage from that 1982 competition was put in a time capsule and sent into space where it was discovered by an alien race and? misinterpreted. The unnamed aliens took the tape as a challenge to do the galactic equivalent of "racing for pinks". This other planet sends giant versions of our classic arcade games to fight earthlings in a series of battles, with the first planet to get to "game over" three times taking the other's planet as a prize. With the support of the President (and to the dismay of military leaders played by Brian Cox and Sean Bean), Sam and company link up with weapons designer Lt. Colonel Violet van Patten (Michelle Monaghan) to fight? high energy light with high energy light.As the attacks unfold, the pixels (actually, voxels, because they're presented as three-dimensional cubes and the film is in 3-D) take the form of a different classic arcade game each time, announce their next attack via re-dubbed versions of early 1980s news and entertainment video clips, and commence to pixelate everything from ordinary objects to famous buildings to people, which is how they capture humans and transport them to their spaceship as war trophies."Pixels" both is and isn't your typical Adam Sandler movie. It's more high concept than most of his other Happy Madison Productions, but has typical Sandler-esque elements such as his character's friendship with a young boy and budding romance with a beautiful woman, plenty of 1980s music (including one of those songs amusingly sung on stage by one of the film's characters) and cultural references from that decade, some of his usual crew in the cast (although not as many as usual), a few well-done celebrity cameos and a moral of the story which includes underdogs making good and rising above their personal histories. There's some juvenile humor, but this script features better jokes than most of Sandler's recent comedies, while the sure hand of director Chris Columbus (director of two "Home Alone" movies, two "Harry Potter" movies and many others) maintains great pacing and keeps things very entertaining.The special effects are crude, but that's by design since the attackers take the form of decades old video game characters, which don't have nearly as many pixels as those in today's games. However, the filmmakers cleverly use the rules of those old games to drive the movie's plot. Those who remember the 80s will appreciate this film the most, but it also appeals to those born long after The Me Decade ended, as I observed in the reactions of my fellow theater patrons and as a young lady and young man (15 and 16-years-old, respectively) with whom I spoke after the movie confirmed. Better than previous 80s video game movie adaptations like "Tron", "Pixels" is the most fun I've had at the movies in a long time! And isn't that what going to the theater is all about? This is a movie that ISN'T supposed to be realistic and IS supposed to be silly and fun. Lighten up, critics. As this review ends, the pixels on my computer screen form the letter "A".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Every single moment of this movie embarrassed me, there only a few redeeming qualities in this filth and that was the admittedly eye popping visuals in terms of the arcade games and the charming performance of Peter Dinklage from Game of Thrones, that is where the positives end for this waste of film. This movie has no idea what it wants to be or who it's target audience is because it plays out like a typical Adam Sandler vehicle just with video games added in so he can cash in on gamer's nostalgia for arcade games. None of the jokes were funny and were underwhelming, Josh Gad annoyed the crap out of me, there is absolutely no love put into this movie and is the very definition of a missed opportunity, there is so much that could have been done with the concept yet the potential was disposed of just so that Sandler can continue to steal our money with predictable idiotic humor that isn't even witty, sarcastic, clever, or self-referential or even a shred of respect for the classic games put on display. I felt embarrassed for the talent that was wasted for this film such as director Chris Columbus, Michelle Monaghan, Sean Bean, and Peter Dinklage, they deserved better than this. In conclusion I hated this movie, it had massive potential but instead massively disappointed me. In short don't see it at all, you have much better choices in theatres right now.

		<shortDescription>Better alien invasion comedy then The Watch(2012)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I understand why critics come down on Adam Sandler, when it comes to his comedies they are pretty much hit or miss, but to some more miss then hit.Gamers from the 1980's are called upon by the government when an alien invasion comes in the form of old video game characters, and half to try to defeat them like the game. But will they save the day before it's too late?Like some of Adam Sandler comedies, this is not a great film, but it never tries to be, but it is entertaining, I did laugh a few, end enjoyed the effects. Adam Sandler is good, so was Michelle Monaghan, I won't forget Kevin James. But the real scene steelers that take the cake are Peter Dinklage and Josh Gad, they get the most funny lines, and never go too far over the top. I enjoyed this movie, it never tries to be anything more than what it is, just a fun time, sometimes that is all you need. The cast play off each other perfectly, but if you where not entertained by this, I'm sorry that you weren't.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was expecting this to be horrible, and I was actually surprised that I found this movie to be entertaining at all. There was some moments that weren't very funny and feel a bit awkward. I feel like the first bit of the movies was better because it was more comedic and didn't take itself too seriously. But after the first fight, I found the whole thing to just be a bit silly, with only occasional parts that I laughed at. It started throwing in subplots that you really don't care much about and continually trying to be "serious", when it really comes off as being melodramatic and stupid. With better direction, I feel like this movie could have been saved, and believe it or not, MIGHT have boosted Adam Sandlar's career, which clearly, hasn't been very good lately. I really can't recommend this, and It's a shame I have to say that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The video game characters are evil?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was a boring movie from the start. The only good things is some of the action helped liven it up and there were some witty moments. I liked the questions Adam Sandler asked but the tension of this film just falls apart. It was quite unrealistic, I mean, how would Adam escape Pac-man by jumping off a roof? He would've got hurt. And I also didn't like the ideas the characters came up with to avoid the video game characters. Like pretending to be the man who doesn't want to die? That's pretty obvious!But almost the whole movie is boring and made me want to fall asleep. There was sappy romance towards the end. The acting and dancing was weird. I thought that the man singing was good in that one scene.I think that there was too much talk about video games in this movie, I know this is a video game movie like Wreck-it Ralph but the special effects to this movie were also weird.This was quite a disappointment. I thought Wreck-it Ralph was better. Both movies are not so bad for children but I recommend to go watch Wreck-it Ralph instead. A lot of things were executed way better as well as the animation and acting and they were not painfully annoying.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fun 80s throwback!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'PIXELS': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five)Adam Sandler's big budget sci-fi comedy bomb; about an alien invasion, in the form of classic 80s 8-bit video game characters. Sandler stars in the movie, with his buddy Kevin James; along with Josh Gad, Peter Dinklage, Michelle Monaghan, Brian Cox, Sean Bean and Jane Krakowski. It was directed by Chris Columbus (who's famous for directing such popular hits as 'ADVENTURES IN BABYSITTING', 'MRS. DOUBTFIRE', the first two 'HOME ALONE' films and the first two 'HARRY POTTER' movies) and it was written by Tim Herlihy (Sandler's buddy, who also co- wrote 'BILLY MADISON', 'HAPPY GILMORE', 'THE WEDDING SINGER', 'THE WATERBOY' and other hit Sandler flicks) and Timothy Dowling (who also co-wrote the Sandler film 'JUST GO WITH IT'). It was based on the 2010 2- minute French animated short, of the same name, by Patrick Jean. It's not nearly as bad as the reviews make it out to be, or the film's Box Office; it's actually pretty entertaining (for an Adam Sandler movie, at least). The movie takes place sometime in the near future, when aliens have misinterpreted a video feed, from earth, featuring classic 80s 8-bit video games, as a declaration of war. So they attack our planet, in the form of characters from those games. Sandler, James, Dinklage and Gad all play former child video game whizzes, from the 80s, who now need to use their skills to combat the alien invasion. They're given three specific game challenges, in which, upon defeat, they'll lose a life (and someone is abducted). When they lose all three lives, earth will be destroyed. James's character is also the President of the United States (for some bizarre reason). The movie is a fun 80s throwback; if you grew up with these arcade games, you should get a kick out of it. The effects are just OK, and it's not especially funny, but it is entertaining; it's a fun summer popcorn flick, at least. It's much better than Sandler's usual slapstick garbage, especially the stuff he's been putting out lately, and it's nice to see him branching out, and trying different things. This is at least somewhat different; he's never done an action movie before. It's also a good kids' film, and it's not too dumbed-down; especially for an Adam Sandler movie!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sb0-wDtevNo</fullReview>

It's a break from reality, Kevin James as the president makes that argument. The visual effects are pretty impressive and the concept of video games used against us is at least something new. I'm getting tired of Hollywood remakes. There are scenes that could have been cut because they didn't bring anything worthwhile to the movie and in fact slowed the pace down.

		<shortDescription>My Thoughts Drift Back In Time To Another Film I Saw In The 80's Called The Wizard(1989).</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A formulaic hero saves the day film. The film pays homage to the 80's era of 2D pixel video games, notable Pacman and Centipede. Adam Sandler plays Brenner, a man who can see the "pattern" in these old arcade machines and beat them. He has a nemesis in Eddie Plant(Peter Dinklage) who beats him in the Arcade Game World Championship winning first prize.Plot: In the summer of 1982, Sam Brenner and Will Cooper are thirteen-year-olds who love playing in the local arcade. Brenner enters an arcade game world championships. At the event, the MC tells that a time capsule will be launched into space containing a videocassette that includes scenes from the championships.In the present, Brenner works for a company that installs home theater systems and Cooper is the President of the United States. In Guam, a U.S. military base is attacked. The soldiers try to fight back, but are easily defeated, and one soldier is abducted.Brenner is sent to work at the home of Violet Van Patten, a divorcée who lives with her son Matty. Brenner heads to the White House after receiving a call from Cooper. To his surprise, he finds out that Violet is a Lieutenant Colonel. Cooper brings Brenner into the Oval Office to show him the attack in the base. Brenner says that the way the attack was carried out was like in the classic version of the video game Galaga.Later, Brenner drives home when Ludlow suddenly appears inside his van. Ludlow takes Brenner to his home where he says that the aliens are sending creatures with classic video game designs to attack. Ludlow found a message using manipulated footage to explain their plans: The tape was found and seen as a threat; they are using the video games as a challenge. If they win three rounds, they will claim the Earth.Watch the film to find out what happens next...Verdict: An enjoyable time-pass film which has some great C.G.I. effects. The action sequences are the highlight of the film. There are some veteran actors in the film: Brian Cox who plays Admiral Porter, Sean Bean as British Corporal Hill and Japanese actor Denis Akiyama who plays Toru Iwatani, the creator of Pac-Man. Dan Ackroyd makes a cameo appearance as the Arcade Game World Championship M.C.Kevin James, star of sitcom The King of Queens plays William Cooper, the President of the United States. Josh Gad gives an excellent performance as Ludlow Lamonsoff, a conspiracy-theory-obsessed, genius with poor social skills.Directed by veteran director Chris Columbus who is known for directing such movies as Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone (2001), Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (2002), Mrs. Doubtfire (1993), Home Alone (1990) and Home Alone 2: Lost in New York (1992) and for writing movies such as Gremlins (1984) and The Goonies (1985).Adam Sandler is not a great favorite of mine, but his acting is bearable here. He sticks to the lines given to him and does not overdo the sarcasm he is known for. Complementing him is Kevin James who gives a reserved performance. In every Adam Sandler movie, there's a hot chick opposite him. In this one it's Michelle Monaghan who plays a divorcée single mom Violet van Patten. Violet also works for military as a weapons developer. Ashley Benson is cast as eye candy in the role of Lady Lisa, a beautiful warrior from the fictional 1982 video game Dojo Quest.Overall the film cannot be considered a work of serious film-making. It will appeal to casual film goers.More "Hero Saves The Day Films": Superman(1978), Commando(1985), Die Hard(1988), Army of Darkness(1992), Last Action Hero(1993).List of arcade video games: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_arcade_video_gamesThank you for taking the time to read my review.

		<shortDescription>An Unwanted Relic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pixels is getting a lot of gripe either because it's an Adam Sandler movie or it apparently rips off a Futurama episode. But putting those complains aside, this movie is designed to be nostalgic to the times when we admire these classic arcade games. But it's tough having that kind of magic since, as most people were right, Sandler's humor and clichés keep getting in the way. There is some fun ideas that the film could have explored more often than the standard tropes of its star, but for some reason, it's impossible. While Pacman and Donkey Kong are truly timeless, Sandler just keeps beating the dead horse of his glory days. The best part of the entire movie is the opening, where we see the childhood of the main characters spend their time at the arcade. It shows the culture where videogames impact the lives of these kids until they grow up. And then, the world has gotten weird at the present day. Aside the fact that one of the kids is now the President of the United States, the movie finally sticks to the collection of Adam Sandler movie clichés. Even though the aesthetics kind of established something larger-than-life here and there, the movie rather focuses on how Sam Brenner tries to hook up with the pretty girl he just met and his unexciting life as an adult. When the aliens invade, there is some colors to be appealed for, but again, the focus is subdued by a number of subplots from each of its main characters.And that's the serious problem of the film; of course it's a comedy that doesn't need to take itself seriously and prioritize more on the laughs, but the humor is clearly not as inspired as it wants to be. We're still being pushed to this romantic subplot that isn't really that interesting, also Brenner and his gang are being degraded for being nerds even though they act more like downright weirdos. These bits are hardly worth rooting for. When it comes to the main plot itself, it's often illogical, but it doesn't quite matter. But the best punchline through that nonsense is when one of the players used cheat codes in the aliens' game IN REAL LIFE. It indicates that even the screenwriters have no idea how these work and it's funny because they just throw it in idiotically without this "self-aware" reaction, like what they did to Q- Bert in the end.The action is quite impressive at least. The special effects bring a lot of energy and visual candy on screen. It's pretty cool seeing these games come to life with this scale and cause mayhem whatever place they stumble in. But again, the camera just can't move away from the characters. The acting isn't really that special, even when they're trying. Adam Sandler is still the lazy Sandler we see, no matter how many times he is claimed as a nerd. Michelle Monaghan is unable to shine due that her role is written as a cliché. Josh Gad and Peter Dinklage have the enthusiasm, even if the script is supposed to make them obnoxious, but they are the sole charm among these main characters.Pixels is far from Sandler's worst; we could spare it for the impressive craft, entertaining ideas and some rare jokes that work which are intentional and otherwise. But overall, nobody wants to see this type of movie anymore. It could have worked if it was made in the last decade or two, when the actor is still not getting much heat from the audience yet. This movie seeks for nostalgia, but the nostalgia we'd rather see is the classic games than Sandler's old tricks. And it's quite sad that the filmmakers did try to build something crazier in this world; there are aliens and a robot in this movie! But it keeps moving away to the least interesting parts. That side only gets interesting when the screenwriters got things wrong, like the fact that the heroes fight better than the military only because they grew up with the games or, again, the cheat codes. There's an opportunity of fun hinted along the sides, but again, Sandler's fingerprints are too inevitable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is about Video Arcade titles available in 1982 and kids now adults that were the kings of these games. Once you get that straight then the movie makes comedic sense.This was a much funner movie than I thought it would be. I like Adam Sandler (loved Happy Gilmore) but a couple of his recent movies have been admittedly bad "Jack &amp; Jill).The nostalgia it brought back along with the jokes and puns (most of which were intentionally nerd lame) were part of what made the movie more enjoyable. A lot of the jokes were NOT aimed at the children's age group.The movie was definitely written to appeal to those of us that played these games back in the 80's and definitely NOT written for people who only like Xbox/playstation/PC gaming.I left the movie laughing and joking and was generally surprised I liked it a lot more than the trailers made me think I would.After reading some of the online reviews it seems a lot of Adam Sandler trolls are busy bashing it.I liked it better than the new Mad Max, the new Terminator, and a few other big time movies I've seen lately so I say ignore the haters and go watch the movie if you have any fond memories of playing Pac-Man, Donkey Kong, Centipede, Defender, Galaga, Frogger, Qbert, and tons more..... the trip back on memory lane is worth the price of admission.</fullReview>

But ignore all the critics and the hate that goes along with them, and go see one of the funnest films of the summer. The acting isn't great, its a Sandler film, you shouldn't be expecting it to be. The visual effects on the other hand, were done very well, considering the film did have an 88 million dollar budget. This is a movie definitely worth your quarters.</fullReview>

I thought this movie would be fun, but then I saw it was an Adam Sandler movie and assumed it would be lazy, boring, unfunny and stupid. Unable to resist seeing giant Pac-Man and Centipedes, I purchased the official DVD anyway (or maybe I just downloaded it; you decide.) I kept my thumb on the fast-forward until a video game sequence. When the video game sequences ended, and it switched back to "plot" and "comedy", I fast forwarded again to the next video game sequence. In this way, I was able to enjoy the entire 5 minute movie.Two stars for five minutes of fun. -1 star for being a Sandler movie.Bottom line: Best enjoyed in fast forward.</fullReview>

For those of you who might be averse to the presence of Adam Sandler and/or Kevin James, note that both are quite subdued in this film, especially since the real stars are the video game characters who are invading Earth. The action sequences are all brightly colored and fast paced as well as fun to watch, and since everything the aliens destroy simply pixelates and disappears, the "violence" is more comical than anything. Peter Dinklage also takes a surprisingly comic turn in his role as the all-time video game champion; few, if any, jokes are related to his short stature. If you're not willing to spend the money to see "Pixels" in the theater, do yourself a favor and at least rent it when it's released on DVD. If you watch this movie without preconceived notions, you might be pleasantly surprised.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>After hiring A-listers and paying for CGI, no money left for script</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Disappointingly bad movie.The CGI is kind of cool, but the performances are flat, the comedic timing is off, and Sandler just doesn't seem to be making an effort at all(although this may just be his style). In fact, I'm sure that part of the dialogue was either a first-take or else ad lib. How do you get Sean Bean, Adam Sandler, and a few other well-known actors to participate in something so lazy? They could have used a studio audience or a laugh track.I think I know where this movie came from. Someone decided to market a nostalgia film (1980s arcade games) to fathers who have boys aged 12-14. The humor is not sophisticated enough for a normally developed adult intellect, but it also is not appropriate for small children with all the adult themes. It doesn't work. I felt icky watching it.There are a number of 10-star reviews on here. Could the studio have hired people to write them?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Career Saving Movie?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first saw the trailer for this movie I thought it looked absolutely amazing... then Adam Sandler showed up. This immediately tempered my expectations for this film, but it had a fantastic plot, and enough actors/actresses that I still was pretty excited for it. What I watched absolutely blew me away.The basic premise of the movie is this: an attempted communication with aliens is taken as a threat of war, and so they attack earth using the very games they were sent footage of. In order to defeat them and save earth, a group of people who were video game champions as kids are called upon to save the planet.As previously mentioned, I loved some of the acting choices for this movie. Ashley Benson is a personal favorite, and despite only having very limited screen time, and not actually saying a single word, she delivers a very strong performance as Lady Lisa. Peter Dinklage is most known for his role on Game of Thrones, but I personally know him from the horror comedy Knights of Badassdom. Previously I knew him as a vulgar, "out there" comedy actor, but in this film he manages to tone it down enough to make it a (mostly) family friendly performance, while still maintaining the edge that I love about him. This was actually my first time seeing Michelle Monaghan, and I didn't know Josh Gad too well, but both of them (in particular Gad) had more than noteworthy performances.Now finally for the biggest question mark of the film, Sandler. As the title I put to the review indicates, I believe this has the potential to be a career saving movie for him. I have previously only truly enjoyed him 3 times, the latest being The Longest Yard, and before that in Happy Gilmore and Billy Madison. More recently I have wasted money going to the theatres to see his films, and even seeing what I consider to be the 2 worst movies I've ever seen in theatre in Funny People, and Jack and Jill. But he delivers a great performance here, and has made a step in earning my trust back in movies.Overall, I'm not trying to say the film is without flaw, but then again not many films are. This is a very fun movie, and will keep you entertained the entire time. I give this movie a 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ignore the negativity, go see this movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I want to start off by saying that I think people are being unfairly critical of this movie. I went in with medium expectations, and I was blown away. Sure, it was silly, but it is a comedy, not an Oscar-winning drama. The visual effects were very intriguing, something I had not seen before in a movie. I think all of the actors gave fantastic performances, yes, even Adam Sandler, and the full theater I was in was laughing constantly. Most importantly, I left the theater feeling better than I did going in there. I left this movie with a warm feeling, and a smile that would not leave my face. This film is heartwarming fun for the whole family, and plenty of nostalgia for fans of the 80s. Don't listen to the critics! Go see this movie and form your own opinion! Definitely Adam Sandler's best movie in a long time. I cannot recommend this movie enough! If you want to have a great time on a hot summer day, go see it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pixels is easily one of the worst comedies I've seen in a long time. In fact, it's not even a comedy because comedies are funny movies and this doesn't have a single joke that was funny. The acting in this movie is also hilariously AWFUL! Another terrible thing about this mess is the filming. There was only about 4 scenes in this thing that were clear, but still weren't even that clear! There are tons of mistakes in this movie that are as clear as mud, but the biggest one is the fact this movie was made! Pixels is unfunny, TERRIBLY filmed, HORRIBLY acted, PACKED with mistakes and is just a huge mess! This movie is just so hilariously awful! On a scale from A+ to F, Pixels would get a F!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So bad it's offensive</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can only assume that the positive reviews for this tripe can only have been submitted by people involved with the studio. I appreciate that this is a film for children but you have to do more than just throw a load of money at the CGI and say that'll do. The script and dialogue appears like it was written on the back of a napkin on the day of the shoot, it's just awful and you can tell that the actors know this as the movie progresses. Make no mistake this was a paycheque to them and nothing more.just because it's a film aimed at children doesn't mean you shouldn't at least try. Positives? There aren't really any, I suppose the nostalgia effect was nice at times looking back at the games we used to play growing up, but that's about it. Fortunately I caught this film on one of the movie channels so I didn't have to part with any extra hard earned cash, it's almost as terrible as Battleship and that's saying something.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't like Adam Sandler. Never have. Don't find him funny at all. There.Having said that I saw some reviews for Pixels on here that suggested I should give this as a try, with superlatives such as 'hilarious', 'laugh out loud' and 'brilliant' used to describe the humour and entertainment to be had - flying in the face of the critics who described it as a dog.They were very, very wrong and, I hate to say it but the critics were spot on.Sandler is as unappealing as ever and the humour childish and unfunny throughout - though he isn't the only bad thing about this film by a long way. The performances are poor without exception, some of the actors (such as Kevin James as a bungling President) are woefully mis-cast and all are easily outperformed by their pixelated co-stars.The ending is just as moronic as the rest of the film. The special effects are okay in the action sequences. The storyline is confused and it feels as if the film lasts for 3 hours, though apparently the running time is 'only' 1 hr 45. Perhaps someone became aware of this as the final large setpiece feels rushed. The soundtrack is plastered over the top of the film as if in some grotesque afterthought.All in all, it left me puzzled. Who would this film appeal to ? The average teen would have outgrown the unsophisticated, in-your-face, clumsy humour...and would be too young to be aware of the so-called 'classic' games that the movie is presumably trying to evoke some feeling of nostalgia for.Next time - I will listen the critics (and my intuition) and give anything with Adam Sandler a wiiide berth.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Goofy Adam Sandler action comedy that does little to satisfy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Adam Sandler, Kevin James, Josh Gad, and Peter Dinklage take on the video game world in this goofy sci-action comedy that should have been funnier than it was. Sandler plays Sam Brenner who grew as an expert gamer on arcade games in the 80s. After facing a humiliating loss by Eddie, nicknamed the "Fireblaster" (Peter Dinklage) at an arcade competition, Brenner's life lands him in a job working for company selling flatscreen televisions. When the world becomes under attacked by aliens from the game Galaga as well as characters from other classic Atari games who are set destroying earth. Teaming up with his eccentric friend Ludlow (Josh Gas), President Will Cooper (Kevin James), and Eddie, Brenner puts his video game skills to the test in attempt to save the world before the video game villain onslaught madness. Directed by Chris Columbus, this film features some of the iconic figures of the classic Atari games from the 80s including Pac-Man (who is a bad guy this time around), Q'Bert, Arkanoid, Tetris, Donkey Kong, Asteroids, Space Invaders, and Centipede.I had rather low expectations for this movie. The idea of the characters fighting against pixelated video games characters who invade Earth does sound quite interesting on paper, but looks utterly silly on screen. The shots of Pac-Man attacking a downtown area and the aliens from Galaga destroying the buildings and major landmarks like the monuments does attract children's attention, but will very likely lose attention from adults when they see this being an Adam Sandler movie. Although this movie does manage to bring out a few laughs here and there, it does little satisfy. The action sequences and the bloated use of CGI pixelated characters are fun to watch for those who grew in the 80s during the age of Atari, but can't save this movie from the disappointment it is. Peter Dinklage and Josh Gad are the only ones manage to have anything remotely funny to say, while Adam Sandler and the rest of the cast are left sitting on the sidelines of humorous dialogue. Pac-Man creator Toru Iwatani makes a rather goofy appearance midpoint through the film before getting his hand chewed off by Pacman, leaving him with pixel dripping arm. The problem is the movie spends the majority of the time drenching the audience with non-stop CGI pixel galore, and neglects its effort on coming up with true laughter.Pixels is one of those comedies that will very likely appeal to kids, but feel like a chore to watch for adults. While this isn't one of Adam Sandler's worst comedies like Jack and Jill and That's My Boy, it certainty doesn't fit the bill and suffers from a weak script. Those who carry interest in retro gaming may find a little entertainment in this, others will be left with strong discontent.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, after i saw the trailer i thought - what an original idea - it had so much potential. Firstly, i'll admit that the visual effects were great and the plot wasn't that of a disaster. But, i was frowning the entire movie because of disappointment. It would probably appear somewhat stupid even to small children.If i had to describe it in one sentence, it would be: It was the most stupid, obnoxious, full of plot holes and more than full of clichés movie. The entertainment value is to the minimum, there are some comedic points, but i have never seen such an atrocity that even dares to call itself a movie.In conclusion, would i recommend watching it? Probably not, though it would be somewhat entertaining to small kids or total morons.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>PixelsIf modern video game characters ever came to life much cooler avatars of everyone you know would overpopulate the world.Fortunately, the sentient screen villains in this comedy are only 8-bit characters.When Earth is attacked by an advanced race of aliens based on archaic arcade games like, Centipede, Pac-Man and Donkey Kong, the U.S. President (Kevin James) recruits his old school gamer friends Sam (Adam Sandler) and Ludlow (Josh Gad) to train the Marines.But when the noobs fail epically, the Commander and Chief must strike a deal with the imprisoned player (Peter Dinklage) who beat Sam in the 1982 World Championships.While in the right hands this high-concept throwback to the joystick days could have been a nostalgic romp, but instead it has been curtailed by the brainless brand of bad 80s' humour its producer Adam Sandler embodies.Incidentally, to defeat gamers simply stop their supply of ADHA medication.

		<shortDescription>Its called "Pixels"!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Reading some reviews about acting and style of direction and things like goofs and mistakes I have to say that the movie is called " Pixels",,,it features Adam Sandler and it is about aliens from outer space watching us playing 80's style video games and thinking we are challenging them to war which makes them come to our planet to fight it out.....every person seeing this would have seen the trailer so therefore EVERYBODY would have known before watching this exactly what was going on and the style of the movie ....so why all the comments about not liking it?As far as I can see it's exactly what you see on the tin! There may be one or two little mistakes and yes,,it may not be the acting to receive any Oscars but I watched it in 3D with my 12 year old daughter and we both thoroughly enjoyed it. As soon as we got home she started researching old video games to play. i have to say Sean Bean hammed himself up big time and everybody seemed to have such fun here...the use of 3D is very very good and definitely sequel material.Catch it with the kids for a great summer day out. Forget the bad reviews...I think they expected Shakespeare...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Personally I'm probably about the right age to appreciate the retro humour in Pixels and certainly the wide range of recognisable faces give their best for a fun movie. It's very colorful and I'm sure kids would love it. For me it just didn't gel. It's quite innocent kid friendly stuff but for adults it just wasn't smart enough humour. There's lots of childish jokes, nothing wrong with that, then Sandler weighs in with some dead pan stuff that just doesn't seem to sit right. I guess pulling off this kind of movie is difficult, in comparison Wreck it Ralph I loved. All in all fun enough, plenty of colourful action, rather silly characters, but not a classic.</fullReview>

There was no proper story,the dialogues were childish, the acting was terrible and it felt similar to Sandler's recent movies. There were some good actors in this movie and all should review their film selection policy/agent. I really feel for Sandler because with proper director he can really bring a lot on screen but currently it feels like a son of a rich dad, who is paying to be on the screen. Time, money and IQ points lost. I hope people will not review movies like this in positive manner. This repetition of Adam Sandler movies is killing me and I just keep waiting for the one that will be at least a decent movie. Even Night Shyamlan performs better than Sandler.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the type of film that you see the trailer for and think "It will either be amazing or terrible" In this case, its pretty much terrible. I love the concept for this film with it being inspired by old arcade games but I don't think they pulled it off very well. It was kind of like 'oh no they are being attacked by space invaders who are going to destroy the world but its OK because in the final battle something will happen which makes them more determined to save the world and then they kill the big boss and then everything is fine' Its just so predictable. I was really interested in this film because I love video games and as soon as I hear the title and saw the cover I immediately wanted to see it but now i'm just a bit disappointed. It could have been such a good film but instead turned out to be a disaster. I decided to give a 5/10 because, for me, the concept of the film was amazing but they just didn't pull it off right.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun video-game scenes but seriously, Adam Sandler, why?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pixels, a film that when i first heard of it i thought had a really great premise, seriously, classic video-games coming down to attack earth and the only way to defeat them is by playing by the rules of the game. On paper that sounds like a very fun and entertaining time, but then you add Adam Sandler, Kevin James, and a boring story and you get this barely watchable garbage with very few redeemable qualities. My main hope for this film was that Adam Sandler would not be playing a dumb character who speaks with stupid voices, yells, tells shitty jokes and that he would just play a more laid back character who can still be funny on occasion. But although he isn't as bad as he has been in recent years he is still the low point of this film and drags it down, like, a lot. I don't think i need to spell it out for you that Sandler has had a serious problem finding a good film since 2006's 'Click'. So i really shouldn't be surprised at the fact that this isn't a return to form, but Sandler at his best is hilarious so i will keep hoping that one day we will get a good Sandler comedy, unfortunately, this is far from it.Now, the story in this film is just so dumb and cheesy and really doesn't have much substance to it at all. The film is literally a few video-game battles scattered throughout with a whole bunch of side-plots and jokes in-between. But when literally 95% of those side-plots are crap and you don't care about them it makes those scenes drag on and on. You have the obligatory romance that totally does not fit into the film at all and is a bunch of forced, completely out of place pile of crap that offers nothing more that cheap running jokes and filler to add to that run-time. Seriously, not a major plot spoiler here but be warned, (all in the first 20 minutes or so) a kid calls Sandler to install a T.V then he meets the kids mother, recently divorced, they talk, and then she happens to be a DARPA agent going to the same place as Sandler and then happens to for some reason be the person assigned to work closely with Sandler for the remainder of the movie. Did they even try? Some of the characters/performances were OK at best, Peter Dinklage wasn't great but he was kinda bearable, Josh Gad was probably the best in the film and that isn't saying much. But the scenes with them at least kept me awake, if i had to sit there watching Sandler and Kevin James the whole time i'd have zoned out really quickly. Sorry, did i say Kevin James? I meant PRESIDENT Kevin James...... whose dumb-ass idea was that, imagine a world where Paul Blart is the president, yeh, i know it's dumb. When was the last time Kevin James was actually funny, i can't watch this guy anymore and he is heading down the same track as Sandler, if he isn't there already. His character served no purpose other than crappy jokes and an excuse to have Sandler's character at every place at the right time. And they even dragged Brian Cox and Sean Bean into this film, why they agreed i will never know. So, what did i like? I actually found the video-game battles to be somewhat enjoyable, some more than others. Just seeing these old arcade games come to life in a 3D world actually was quite cool it looked good visually and were the highlights of the film. Sandler didn't bother me much in those scenes because the focus was taken off him for a moment, of course, if you took him out of the scene it still would have been better. Especially the last 10-15 minutes i enjoyed quite a bit, i won't spoil it but it was just fun to watch and got me to laugh for the first and only time. So, in the end, i guess this is a good film for kids who will laugh at anything, and for those people who find Sandler still funny, whoever who are. But if you are looking for a good video- game based film, just watch Wreck-It-Ralph and you won't be disappointed. I would have maybe pushed this film to nearly a 5 but they had to keep that goddamn piece of **** absolutely ******* dumb scene in there with Toru Iwatani so it loses a point. - 4/10</fullReview>

For adult audience story is just too lame even with it's try of nostalgic memories. Of course if you choose to go to watch this movie you perhaps wont even expect much of it. It is worth to think to watch this movie at your own home theatre. Script is lame and humor won't make you even laugh a bit. Characters are lame and uninteresting even they try to tell you something about blended families. It makes me wonder if Hollywood studios are so stupid to think that they can release this kind of crap and even make some money out of it. How stupid they think that movie audience is today? This could be perfect family entertainment as straight to DVD format and digital release, but it is not worth of movie release.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The magic of arcade games is lost</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The start of the movie was very nostalgic. The viewers who grew up in the 80s and 90s would most likely agree. Pac-Man, Donkey Kong, Space invaders. All these arcade games just flash by you. The arcade too is named "Electric Games". The promise the movie showed during the starting few minutes is immediately lost. We see President Cooper (played by Kevin James) and Brenner (by Adam Sandler) involved in silly discussions. It may have been done to show the president as a very friendly person but what it does is shows him as a silly guy you would meet on the streets. President Cooper has turned the White House into more like a public picnic area.Violet (by Michelle Monahagan) is simply splendid in her opening scene. The makers of the movie could have given Violet more importance and more screen time. She is good in bits and pieces when she appears. The same with Eddy (by Peter Dinklage). Eddy just doesn't stand out. His flamboyance and flair are neither goofy nor stupid.Parts of the movie still do make you sit up and enjoy. For instance when Matty asks Brenner if classic games mean Counter Strike, a surprised Brenner replies 'no'. And when the Admiral was trying to blame Iran and Moscow, it does put a smile on your face. I believe aliens were brilliantly done. You get to see them communicate directly with the earthlings, but never see a green or double headed creature with tentacles.With all the war against the aliens you fail to understand what the director wants to deliver. If it was to make the current generation kids understand the simplicity of the arcade games or make the adults feel nostalgic about their childhood. The movie fails on both accounts.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So far this decade, Adam Sandler has churned out one awful movie after another. From "Jack &amp; Jill" to "That's My Boy", his efforts at entertainment have been atrocious. Then along comes "Pixels", which shows possible signs of redemption for Mr. Sandler."Pixels" is simply an enjoyable and fun day at the cinema, and it does not try to be anything more. Adam Sandler, Kevin James, Josh Gad, and Peter Dinklage team up as four video game experts who come from different walks of life. Sandler is a TV installer, James is the president of the United States, Gad is a conspiracy theorist, and Dinklage is a criminal. They are called to order when an alien race sends down attack squadrons in the form of classic video game characters. From Pac-Man to Donkey Kong, it appears that the world is headed for a disaster of pixelated proportions. Can Sandler and his gang save the world, or is it game over?Director Chris Columbus, who wrote classic 80s films like "Gremlins" and "The Goonies" and directed classics like "Home Alone" and the first two Harry Potter films, did a great job at bringing all these characters to life. The effects look pretty impressive, and the chemistry among the actors is certainly believable. Bottom line, I enjoyed the film as both a gamer and a sucker for 80s pop-culture, which there is plenty of referenced. In the end, I would recommend it to those with these similar taste. It is certainly not a movie for everyone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Sandler flop</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Adam Sandler once again delivers a lazy "comedy" that cements the fact that he will just show up in a movie, make some jokes, and then cash a paycheck. Pixels I thought could have been the one decent movie in the pool of movies like Grown Ups because it has Chris Columbus directing and the premise based on the short film. The result, however, is just as clichéd and lazy as Sandler's other movies only with a shinier look to it.Good: I liked the effects used to bring these games to life. They are colorful and are rendered well. The Pac Man scene was pretty fun and I like the concept. In terms of laughs, Dinklage gets the best laugh in the entire movie. Kevin James doesn't trip and fall in every scene which is a plus.Bad: The movie is beyond lazy. It follows the typical Sandler formula with Sandler just making fun of people and sleepwalking through the movie. He just makes fun of people and gets worshiped by everybody even though he's a jerk most of the time. The rest of the cast don't fair much better. Josh Gad just screams his lines and his subplot involving his crush on a video game character is plain stupid. Dinklage gets some moments, but the material is too weak for him to make something of it. The scenes involving the video games lack any true flair despite having many possibilities to make something out of it.Overall, this is more of Sandler's laziness with a bigger budget. It is painfully unfunny, clichéd, sexist, annoying, and frankly dull.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hilarious, possibly the funniest movie of the year!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From Donkey Kong to Pac-man, from Adam Sandler to Josh Gad, this film really has anything you could imagine. Pixels is the funniest film of the year so far!This is, of course, a comedy. However, along with that, there is a lot of drama and a hint of romance all packed into one huge adventure made for the entire family to enjoy.The story features Brenner (Adam Sandler) who installs electronic equipment for a living. However, when an alien species attacks in the form of 1980s classic video games, Benner and his friends are the only ones capable of stopping them. And, to do so, they must beat the aliens, as if they were in the game.This film is fantastic! The special effects are absolutely mind blowing. There are no boring scenes and some special effects are simply mind-blowing fantastic. I still can't figure out how they did it some of them. The acting is spot on. One scene I really liked is where two kids are competing on classic arcade machines with Donkey Kong loaded on them. The director makes it so you see them playing, their points and the screen as well as the reflection of the games in their eyes. It looks amazingzing!My favorite scene is when they are facing Pac-Man in mini coopers that are designed to be the ghosts who chase and destroy Pac-Man. When Brenner is the only one left and Pac-Man just gets a power up which allows him to eat the ghosts, Brenner pulls of an awesome and insane stunts to run away and it is action packed and just stupendous to watch!This film is good for kids, adults and gamers of course. I do believe people in their 30s and 40s would like this the most because they can understand a lot of the older game references. I don't think younger kids should watch this due to the adult language and mature references. I recommend it for ages 9 through 18 and older and give it 5 out of 5 pixelated stars.

		<fullReview>Possibly 1 of the worst all-time movies ever made. I know it's mainly aimed at the pre-teen group, but still... characters have no identity, jokes - if you can call them that - fall flat, over-acting is put in place of anything remotely funny. Also, the editing seems like it was done by 4 different people on 4 different substances. Scenes start and end abruptly, there's never a flow to anything. Just absolutely dreadful. I feel my IQ was just halved. This will undoubtedly be shown in film school one day as "how NOT to make a movie." Kudos all around for contributing to the dumbing down of a nation. Save the children, take them to the park instead of this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another awful Adam Sandler movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Honestly, I am so sick of seeing the same recycled movie over and over again. It's Adam Sandler playing the character he always plays, same thing goes for Kevin James and they have the same dynamic they've had in any other movie they've ever done. The jokes are flat, you could see every one of them coming and you've heard them time and time again. Then, there's of course the love interest that really doesn't serve any other purpose than being that one woman who needs to be convinced that Adam Sandler's character really isn't that much of a loser - you know - like in every other Adam Sandler movie. And it is of course full of clichés. (What did you expect?)What also really bugged me, is that the main storyline of aliens attacking as arcade games is completely stolen from Futurama. So not only is the movie bad, it's also totally unoriginal.2/10 for amazing CGI, but complete waste of time and brain cells otherwise.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The least convincing aspect of Pixels is Kevin James as President of the United States. Did someone vote for Paul Blart, who thought this was a good idea? Sandler's his dorky friend whose stuck in his old, gaming hay-days. In the late 80's he was a gaming phenomenon, but was out- championed by a cocky kid (later played by the almighty Peter Dinklage). Nowadays, he's a wash out, with no real aim in life. Lucky for him then, that aliens start attacking earth in the form of video games. Video feeds of retro arcade games were sent in to outer space as a peace offering, not a admission of war. Sandler, his geeky friend Josh Gad and nemesis Peter Dinklage are the ones leading the defense. Just as unconvincing is the world relying on three gaming wizards. The acting hits all sorts of levels from mediocre (Sandler), to good (Dinklage, Monaghan), to over the top (Gad). Pixels is a lavish, easy to look at yet underwhelming comedy that's only appealing to gamers. At least we get to see Pac-Man and Donkey Kong on the big screen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Could have been a LOT worse.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now I am going to just say that I am not a fan of Adam Sandler. While, I'm sure, a nice guy I just can not get behind his comedy style of poop and pee jokes with some sexual references. So when I heard that good ol' Adam and his regular crew of Kevin James (Paul Blart), Peter Dinklige (of Game of Thrones fame) and Josh Gad (Olaf from 'Frozen') were creating a Video Game based film I was suckered in to checking it out. The plot is Video Games take over, not going to make the 'Futurama' comparison. Of course though, unless you saw the trailer you probably wouldn't know WHY the aliens take over. Sadly they only have a few lines in the script that explain why they attack. Now this isn't really a problem if you saw the trailers, but if you are going into this blind viewers may be confused. As it goes on it just becomes a big pile of clichés that does make way for some interesting battles and references but really doesn't stick. I was surprised when I started laughing a bit. Not often (yes there is the obligatory Happy Madison touch with a few pee, poo and sex jokes) but enough to make myself happy. Something about Adam's cocky personality in this that really makes most of his character jabs something to laugh at. Good enough but could have been better. Now facts. They got a few video game facts wrong. Firstly, I won't spoil it here, but once you see it you will realize the problem especially since these are arcade games. Additionally according to the plot they sent the space thing in 1983 or so. Mario (8-bit NES sprite) didn't exist and in the background during one of the battles he is there. Also, Donkey Kong didn't have set stages like shown in the intro so that's wrong. And there are many other little errors but I won't waste your time here. And the Sony product placements? Don't get me started on that! Overall I am shocked at the rating. Even me, the Happy Madison Production hating self enjoyed this movie more then I thought. Will I watch it again? Maybe. Will I buy it on DVD? No. Do I regret watching it? No. You done good Adam Sandler. Just next time don't make Kevin James president and make yourself a hip gamer. Please.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nostalgic, Ridiculous, Trip to the 80's</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Everyone says video games are bad for you as they are too violent or rot your mind. In Adam Sandler's latest comedy, those comments have been magnified as a race of alien beings misinterpret a deep space satellite transmission as a declaration of war and have chosen classic arcade games as their soldiers. Yes my friends, my next review is on none other than Pixels, a movie that may be one of the most ridiculous adventures to grace the theater. Hi I'm Robbie K and you're just in time for another review on the latest "comedy" release. When you think of Adam Sandler, as well as the plot summary above, you might tag the comedian with words like ridiculous, stupid, immature, etc. Well that might be true, but let's focus on some good qualities of his unique imagiantion. Pixels jumps back into the 80's to bring nostalgic memories of the endangered arcades to nerds like me and amplifies to monstrous proportions. After a fun trip back in time, we jump to the modern day world where Sandler and his typical crew are again the oddballs in popular culture. This is where one of the positives comes in, and that is Sandler's poking at the trends, stereotypes, and culture. I chuckled at the writer's jabs at our government system, mocking their obsession with war, country strives, and glorification of the military. In a manner along the lines of Revenge of the Nerds, nerds are shown to be powerful, using predictability and practice as the mighty tools of defense. This tired and true story line has a nice refreshing twist using games as the medium, but the story is lacking in so many ways. Most stories running tangent to the main plot are very shallow, nothing more than predictable moments that center on wishes shared by our beloved arcaders. How the aliens saw this as a threat, what they looked like, heck even the reasoning of their choices were cut short to be dumped into the flood of jokes this movie is filled with. Speaking of jokes, Pixels is more of Adam Sandler's tactics of being kiddy, geeky, and somehow sweet at the same time. Pixels has loads of his overdramatic, throaty yelling, often partnered with a drawn out with someone rambling on and making a fool of themselves. Other characters were drawn in to the awkward vortex as well, Peter Dinkelage especially dropping into the ludicrous 80's punk with a heavy accent that is more annoying than funny for me. However, I did enjoy some of the humor in this movie, especially witty quips at modern culture. Being a gamer myself I also laughed at a few of the gaming scenarios as well, despite many of them being ruined in the trailers. And yet? Pixels humor gets lost in the teams inability to realize enough is enough. Sandler and his crew take their jokes too far, and don't let up until it is too late and the jokes are super stale that only kids will be cracking up at them. Because of this lack of balance, the movie's humor really only stays consistently funny to kids, who we know can't get enough of the things they love. Let's turn our attention to the game scenes now. Pixels art directors took an interesting path for this film, as they brought the pixelated warriors to life. Most of the soldiers look like high definition renditions of minecraft sprites, obviously designed to pop out of the screen in the 3-D viewings. The arcade games are colorful though, sporting the flashy vibrant hues and shades that caught our attentions all those years ago. Life is further imbued with the sound editing, the 8-bit bings, bongs, and other digital noises filling the high definition speakers and bringing you into the moment. The designers even translated the games 2-D movements into fluid 3-D excitement as the monsters and ships battle our real life defenders. As for the adventure itself, it's okay. The battles with the light guns start out exciting, but it doesn't take long before you realize it's just repeated movements of our heroes shooting left and right with the enemies barely adapting their strategy. As the journey continues, the actions gets better as the situations get a dab of cleverness added them all with an arcade twist. But?they take the scenes too far, and cross into the overdramatic zone and losing its majesty. Exaggerated moves and simple comedy can't beef up the sequences, or improve the movie for that matter. The only thing that might have helped was the kicking 80's soundtrack that played throughout the movie, another fine moment of nostalgia. Okay so Pixels isn't the greatest movie ever, and it may be more of the same Sandler movie magic we've come to know. However, the movie is a fun trip back to a colorful time, and retro gamers will appreciate the references they make throughout the film. There isn't much of a story and things do go stale from time to time, but I think younger audience members will enjoy the adventure to be had. Word of warning, this movie has some fair bit of cursing. My recommendations are to hold off on this movie, as despite the cool special effects, it is not worth the high price of a ticket. The scores are:Comedy/Action/Sci-Fi: 6.0 Movie Overall: 5.0</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie poisoned my lifeblood</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'd say I felt personally victimized by 'Pixels' (and by Sandler's presence in the film industry in general) but Adam Sandler's incessant need to portray nerdy men as victims is far stronger than any discomfort I had watching this embarrassing excuse of a film where women are literally trophies &amp; men that play video games and act like children are paraded as underdogs. At one point Adam Sandler says "For the record, I'm an amazing kisser. All us nerds are. We appreciate it more." and if that doesn't clue you in to how absolutely terrible this movie is then you're probably the target audience. If you need more convincing, the visibly upset woman he just met &amp; tried to kiss (and is also providing a service for, but to hell with professionalism!) calls him "a 210 pound dork who installs flat screens for a living." He retorts with some "What if I was a billionaire and we were on my yacht and I wasn't 30 going on 13" line, basically imploring her to admit she was being shallow. If you listen really, really carefully, you can collectively hear men around the world yelling "OWNED!" only to be hushed by their parents, because no respectable adult would watch this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The most family friendly action movie this year</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I read the same horrible reviews as everyone else going in and was pleasantly surprised. Pixels delivered exactly what it promised in the trailer: total misfits save the world from a wacky invasion by nostalgic aggressors. Oddly, they spent a lot of time making the premise seem logical. I hadn't planned on analyzing the plot that closely, but meh, okay. The only conceit I had trouble swallowing was someone as young as Michelle Monaghan being in her character's position. It was easier buying Kevin James in his role; seems almost believable we'd elect an doufus everyman, if only out of some kind of Clinton/Bush hangover. Next, Being a Happy Madison production, I was concerned about language, but it was nowhere near as cringe-worthy as Ant-Man, and was delivered like a bunch of twelve year-olds, which seemed to take the sting out a bit. Thank you Chris Columbus for not teaching my sixth grader any new phrases. I guess Adam Sandler filling small roles with family made a difference, and it did. I'm getting tired of "family movies" dropping f-bombs and angry, profanity-laden exchanges (I'm looking at you Marvel and Michael Bay).Diversity plus: no little people jokes in dialogue or set up. Diversity minus: Yet again, the world is in danger and only white Americans can save the day. And this is coming from a white American.All in all, worth the 3D premium, my kid enjoyed it, and I'll probably buy the blu-ray, which is more than I've been able to say about an Adam Sandler movie in ten years.</fullReview>

I wondered what the kids who did not experience the games of the 80's thought? Don't know if they get it. But oh well, I did and enjoyed it thoroughly.Loved seeing Peter D. (Game of Thrones little guy). He is crazy and cute in this character. Adam Sandler does well because of those around him. :-)All in all, I liked it and suggest you see it esp. if you remember gaming in the 80's! And remember, it's for fun.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went to see this film today, and thought it wouldn't be that bad.Sure, Adam Sandler movies have been awful in the last couple of years but, I thought I would give this movie a shot.It was truly awful, it has the same quality of the past couple of Adam Sandler movies, which as I said is not a good thing.The movie is bad and not in a "so bad it's good" type of way.The acting is bad, and it felt like the actors didn't really care at all for the movie, and just wanted their money.Adam Sandler gives another Razzie-worthy performance, and the supporting actors are not great either.The direction is bad too,Chris Columbus was good in the early 2000s and 90s but for the past 5 years he has been awful.It feels like he's not even trying because he was successful with Harry Potter and Home Alone.The writing and humor was awful too,something I kinda expected.I didn't expect this movie to be hilarious, but with the fun video games storyline, I thought the humor wouldn't be that bad, oh so wrong I was.This is a terrible film and disgraces the video games image, don't go see this film until DVD or On Demand it's not worth seeing in the theater.1/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a complete disaster.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Since its U.S. release a few months ago, critics have universally panned this kid-friendly action blockbuster as a shallow, by-the-numbers adventure with very little entertainment value. Well, it is shallow and it is by the numbers, but it's hardly the steaming pile of digital poop the tepid critical (and commercial) reception would have you believe. Despite a great central concept ? 80s computer games attack Earth! ? and competent CGI, it doesn't quite reach the level of action excitement it's aiming for with a handful of pedestrian sequences culminating in a cluttered and underwhelming finale. Where it scores power-up points is in the comedy department; the dialogue unexpectedly funny at times with a mix of on-the-nose jokes for the younger audience members and more subtle gags for the adults. There's also the small matter of Peter Dinklage (rocking the greatest mullet you'll witness in 2015), who provides a spark of humorous arrogance every time he's on screen as conceited gamer Eddie 'Fireblaster' Plant. The rest of the cast can't keep up with the little master, although Josh Gad lands a few laughs as conspiracy nut Ludlow Lamonsoff and Michelle Monaghan is reliable as ever as the sane member of the ragtag group. Adam Sandler and Kevin James are, well, Adam Sandler and Kevin James, for better and mostly for worse; the former offering a lazy but mercifully toned-down lead turn, the latter dishing up a frighteningly weird take on the U.S. President. It won't be up for any awards (except maybe a Razzie or two) and is undoubtedly a missed opportunity considering the awesome premise, but Pixels isn't a complete disaster thanks to its comedic successes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a review but a complete walk-through if you really want to watch it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is tough to watch but if you really want to give it a try I'll help you.First, choose your mode.Easy mode: Renting this movie. You can always pause and take a break.Normal mode: Recommended if you are skilled in watching shitty movies. Buying it will cost you 15 bucks, but you can still pause.Hardcore mode: Go, see this movie in a theater, but remember, you can't pause. If you leave, you have to start from the beginning. Choose this if you are a veteran shitty movie-goer and you think you can deal with Adam Sandler, Kevin James and Josh Gad at the same time.Ready? Here we go. The first level is pretty easy. It's just bunch of kids playing arcade games and entering a video game tournament in 1982. With the sweet feeling of nostalgia and the help of your first NPC, (Dan Aykroyd) you will clear this stage with ease.Kids grow up, Kevin James becomes the US President, Adam Sandler becomes a nerd who installs hardware. He meets Michelle Monaghan while installing game consoles for her son. They instantly start telling everything to each other for no reason and they almost make out. (because they're both getting divorced or the screenwriter decided to lift this part of the script from the last porn movie he has seen) BTW Adam Sandler doesn't play a complete moron in this movie for a change so his scenes are a bit easier to watch than normal. He is not funny and he doesn't even try to be. He just bores you to death in each of his scenes so be prepared.In a cut-scene, aliens attack Guam. They are in retro video game forms and everything they attack turns into pixels (Actually voxels, since they are 3D, but who cares) So the president does the most logical thing and calls his childhood arcade buddy.You will find your second NPC (Brian Cox) where the government officials try to figure out what's going on. His lines are not funny, but he is a great actor. You will need his talent if you wanna finish this movie. Here is a good trick. In some scenes, he doesn't even talk but there is always a surprised or angry look on his face. Just imagine him saying "WTF am I doing in this movie?" This will perfectly match his facial expression all the time and amuse you more than the movie itself.Save your progress and get ready for the first boss battle. Josh Gad will do a sneak attack but don't worry. He is annoying as hell but not in his true form yet. Just try to ignore him when he is simply narrating the plot of the movie (twice) Right after that, get ready for your first tough battle and prepare your ears to be molested by him. He will use his "yelling for no reason" attack for over 2 mins. He will insult/compliment to soldiers in a never ending, unfunny, uninteresting, unnecessary scene. This is the first time where I lost a life. (or paused the movie and think about what the hell I am doing with my life) If I was watching this movie in hardcore mode, this scene would be my "game over, man! game over!" moment.Sean Bean will show up soon enough and instantly prove that he is a valuable NPC by telling Josh Gad to shut up. Special effects in the Centipede attack scene is quite good and shiny objects always make me forget about all the clichés I see. If you are like me, you can take a breath and prepare yourself for the next level. Still 55 mins to go, so don't let your guard down.When you see the great Peter Dinklage, you may think he can save your ass at first, but just give him a few mins and he will prove that he is actually a boss monster too. He does his best with the given material, but his character is boring and super predictable.The movie wants us to believe that scientists already predicted that Pac-man may be a bad guy and our nerds get ghost cars already prepared for them. Don't worry, there is more shiny stuff so just stare at the screen and try not to think much. It will be over soon.During a boring party scene, we find out that Peter Dinklage pulled a Joffrey Baratheon on us and cheated during the Pac-man battle. Now, the world is under attack and by the world I mean Washington DC, obviously. Get ready for the final battle.One of the aliens takes the form of Lady Lisa and gets close to killing Josh Gad, but she blows it and robs us from the chance of getting rid of him. More shiny stuff gets blown up and our nerds get an invite to the mothership for a final showdown. Adam Sandler beats Donkey Kong as the most anticlimactic way as possible and saves the world.The defeated aliens leave us a world where Adam Sandler boinks Michelle Monaghan; Kevin James is married to Jane Krakowski, Peter Dinklage gets a threesome with Serena Williams and Martha Stewart; Josh Gad makes 4 kids with Ashley Benson. Yeah, let that sink in.And just when you think it is all over, the credits make you watch the whole thing again in 8-bit style.Congratulations, you beat the movie and wasted 106 mins of your life without smiling one time. A winner is you!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, what can I say. Kids wanted to see it and as I played all the original games when I was a kid, I thought why not, might be good for a laugh or two and Wreck it Ralph was great.In the cinema you could hear every cough and groan and maybe a couple of giggles, but that was about it. Luckily my kids thought it was just as crappy as I did, so walked out about half way through with a bunch of other people at the same time. I guess some of the cgi was OK, but none of the characters worked, especially Kevin James and Adam Sandler that looked like they really couldn't be bothered.To sum up - avoid it, unless it's free and you really, really, really have done everything else in the world, but even if you have, just watch some paint dry.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A One Trick Pony and a Lazy One at That</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pixels has to be Adam Sandler's best movie in years. But please hold your horses because this still pretty much sucks. The trailer more or less tells you what this is about - When aliens misinterpret video feeds of classic arcade games as a declaration of war, they attack the Earth in the form of the video games.That's not a bad idea, actually it sounds like great idea, but Pixels is a one trick pony. The story never tries to take the simple premise one step further and it expects to coast along with the nostalgia generated by these larger than life arcade 'monsters'. I think they have forgotten that everybody who was into these games have grown a lot older. There are some hilarious bits but I just couldn't laugh (likewise with the rest of the pitiful number of heads in the cinema on a Thursday afternoon). One of the reasons is the insipid and lazy script that basically broad-strokes every character into just one identifiable trait, and for the umpteenth time Sandler is the gentle man-child who will win the day and get the girl. It is the same old lazy talking pattern and acting screaming at the world that losers will be winners and shite on the world who thinks otherwise. Do something else man! The script also didn't do the film any favors. Tell me if this makes any sense - "you smell like the Book of Genesis".The only sequence I like is the Pacman one and the only character I dug is Dinklage in a mullet hamming it up, but he couldn't save the movie for me. The only way this movie would work is for the studios to put the film in a time capsule, place it in a time machine and make it go back to the 1980s. The audience then will definitely lap it up. That's where it deserves to be, but that would mean they have to delete that Obama joke.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film was fun, funny, and just plain cool. Its strong suits relied on humor, and fun video game references, two things of which I am a personal fan of. Was this the best work for Chris Columbas or Adam Sandler? No, and this is coming from a die-hard fan of both. But the characters were fun and the cast did a great job of performing them. All that being said, it did have some issues that keep it from being a "quality flick" in my opinion. It seemed as though the stories cheated around all the characters were good, but not well managed. It seemed as though they rushed through all the personal plot lines. So while this movie really hit a good vibe for a fun-loving movie-goer like myself, it seemed as though they didn't make enough time for characters development to be well displayed. All in all, everything wrong with this movie could've been fixed with pacing. None of this is the fault of the hilarious cast or great director. POTENTIAL SPOILERS:The highlights: 2Josh Gads character plays a conspiracy theorist who is extremely socially awkward and does a great job. Josh Gad had an excellent performance and watching his chemistry with Sandler was really a treat. Josh Gad was funny. The Pac-Man scene in NYC is a good thrill that can also cause you to laugh out loud. This scene was best described as "AWESOME" because it was a well put together fun scene that everyone who loves movies can appreciate. Thanks for reading.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A decent action-comedy that's entertaining enough to outshine previous Sandler movies.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first saw the trailers for Pixels, I thought this would be a step forward of Adam Sandler's career since his only film that EVERYONE likes is "Happy Gilmore" (I enjoyed that movie too). But when it came out, critics tore this film apart for how cringe-worthy and unfunny it is. The critical reviews made me nervous that this is going to flaw badly. But gladly, I wasn't disappointed. Well... maybe a little. What I mean is that, I think Pixels isn't bad at all. Of course, it has some problems, but take my advice, it's better than Grown-Ups and Jack and Jill (I haven't seen those movies but I'm sure they'll be terrible).So, what are the things I like about Pixels? First off, is of course, the concept. The concept is so original and inventive. There are many alien invading movies out there but this movie does the unusual way, using video-game characters to "pixelate" everything in their path. The visuals and the action in this movie are quite well-done. It is a bit funny at some parts of the movie. This might be a rare and special praise here but I think it's fast paced.What about the problems? The first problem is that the characters in this movie are kind of weak and forgettable. Before I get to criticism about the story, I want to say like how the plot suggests. Anyway, the problem with the story is that it has some confusing points like there's a Smurf in the movie. Why is the their a Smurf if the invaders only used video-game characters? The biggest problem about the story though is that it's overwhelmingly predictable thanks to the footage of the trailers. Lastly, there are some jokes I didn't really get.Despite having plot confusions and weak characters, Pixels, in my opinion, is an okay summer experience with great visuals, good action and some humour. One thing for certain, you'll probably find this movie better than Grown-Ups and Jack and Jill but don't enjoy this movie too much if you're suffering Sandler's potential.Film Score: 6/10 - Okay</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Sandler bomb?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After forcing myself through Paul Blart 2, i was frustrated. The reason why, was that the folks over at Happy Madison Productions had another attempt at a blockbuster for cinema audiences this year. With an estimated budget of a whopping 88 million dollars, Pixels, directed by seasoned director Chris Columbus, was about alien life forms using retro video game characters to destroy our planet. The synopsis sounded fun, like Independence Day with a slight comedic edge. But this is an Adam Sandler movie we're talking about and comedy hasn't been his strong suit for over a decade, so all we could do was hope for the best out of Pixels.When the movie started, i was pretty optimistic about it. Old rock music, Chopper bikes and Arcade games, this was one for the 80s kids right, no it wasn't. As nostalgic as the opening montage will make you, the movie inevitably slips on it's own bad script. The references are so badly done, just check the goofs section of Pixels' page. The cameos are mostly meaningless with appearances from Dan Akroyd and Serena Williams. There's an appearance by Pacman creator Toru Iwatani as an arcade machine repairman but you'll barely see him unless you really try. Instead, they choose to have an actor play him in the movie, which is just a waste of the budget.It's when the movie goes into present day that it suffers the most, the main cast are wooden, which is down to the fact they are playing a bunch of walking stereotypes. The romance between Sandler and Monaghan is just awkward. But probably the worst part of the cast is the irritating Josh Gad. He screams his way through the entire movie and only hinders the movie rather than helping it. The supporting cast is disappointing to look at. Celebrated actors like Brian Cox, Peter Dinklage and Sean Bean are relegated to playing awfully written characters. Dinklage in particular, puts on this annoying accent and wears an outfit that makes him look like a camp biker.The movie does have some saving graces though. It's visuals are a testament to effects work and at least it had a big enough roster of video game characters to keep you slightly interested. The bad reviews that are posted on the IMDb boards are mostly exaggerated but the movie is never gonna win an Oscar either. I'll be honest, Pixels isn't the worst movie you'll see all year, that honour will probably go to Paul Blart 2. This movie will win some Razzies and it deserves them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nowhere near as bad as people say</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pixels was supposed to be the worst movie of the summer (that trailer for Bill Murray's Rock the Kasbah looks colossally worse). It was supposed to be ridiculous, boyish, puerile, lame, stupid, hackish, dumb-dumb-dumb-fooly-foolish.Surprise! It's all of that! And it's awesome. How else can you make such an outlandish plot work unless you totally sell it. Kevin James becomes the President of the United States?! Doesn't Mark Cuban have something to say about that?Maybe it was the opening scenes that drew me in, giving me a strong sense of nostalgia for those ancient days when quarters seemed like gold doubloons because you could put them into a machine at an arcade and shoot down invaders from outer space. I immediately remembered the infamous Sluggo's arcade where 14-year-old kids chain smoked, tugging on joysticks and slapping buttons while their mothers went shopping at the mall. I remembered that time when I was four and all the kids at the bowling alley were watching me set the record on Spy Hunter and I peed my pants because I didn't want to stop chasing fame.It was worth it, of course.What is a pixel? It's a cube of energy. And it's a weapon. We don't understand it, but we can harness its entirety and make nerds pew- pew it. "Let the nerds take over."Adam Sandler is just fine in the movie. I normally despise his hammy overacting, but he reels himself in when he could clearly be a joker daddy with some of the scenes. And Kevin James isn't annoying, either!The movie is actually filled with some pretty biting satire of modern politics, modern video games, social media, mass media, and conspiracy theorists. As a young man watches the alien invaders destroy the Taj Mahal, he quickly films it with his cell phone and just as quickly decides it would be better if he could be in it so he turns to get a selfie video. Who wouldn't?There's plenty of good cameos, campy references to the pop culture of the 1980s, and a pretty sick burn of One Tree Hill. And we get a nice break from the action at a cocktail party that has a lot of funny moments.I thought Peter Dinklage would be cringe-worthy as a mulleted dork, but he actually garners some sympathy by the end. Brian Cox and Sean Bean give nice over-the-top performances along the way, too.I liked Pixels.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was unclear about the intended audience. Was it for kids, who have never seen arcade games and would find them dull and antiquated? Was it for nostalgic adults, who find modern games hyper-violent and gory? I can't imagine either of those groups finding much of value in this movie. Since there was no effort at plot development, endearing or believable characters, or passable dialogue, I would have to vote for this as a "kids" movie. But, would if have been difficult to have at least *one* plot element consistent or plausible. Whether for kids or not, the acting was almost horrible beyond measure. The support acting crew does well, but Sandler can barely be bothered with the effort. He literally could have phoned in his lines via cell phone and saved himself or the studio the limousine fees.Why not a single star rating? I give it one above minimum for the graphics. Whether intentional or not, I believe they captured the old graphics' style in the 3-D modernization.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let me say the good things in the movie first. And admittedly there were several things I enjoyed in it (hence the 2/10 instead of 1/10). For a start the visual effects were very good, and made for some very fun action sequences. I enjoyed the scenes with Peter Dinklage very much. He was definitely the stand-out performance. Also the opening sequence was very well shot and captured the spirit of classic 80's arcades perfectly.Now onto the problems with the movie. For a start, the movie doesn't seem to know who its audience is. It appears to be a kids movie, with lots of childish humor and a PG rating. But there are so many references to 80's pop-culture icons and games that most of the movie makes little sense to anyone born after 1982. Also there is a fair amount of low-level swearing and some very sexual references so I wouldn't really feel comfortable showing it to a child.The cinema I watched Pixels in was nearly full, yet literally no one laughed at all during the entire movie. That made for an extremely awkward 100 or so minutes. Now how about the cast? Well:Josh Gads character spends much of his screen time yelling obnoxiously in attempted humor (I think) but it is just uncomfortable.Michelle Monaghan is too good for this movie. That's all. Kevin James is unfunny in this as POTUS. His humor consists of him knocking over things and generally being an idiot. I already covered Peter Dinklage. His performance was excellent and helped earn that extra star from me.Adam Sandler was doing his usual lazy, unfunny acting style. The story of him winning over Michelle Monaghan is completely unbelievable to the point where literally no one cares whether he gets the girl or not. Just a very stupid movie which should not be watched, ever.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>These guys not only saved the world; they saved my summer!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all; I will make a startling confession. This is the first live-action Adam Sandler film I've gone to see since 1996's BULLETPROOF. It's true! I thought he completely ruined that movie for Damon Wayans! Which is why I've never seen HAPPY GILMORE, BILLY MADISON (the obvious inspirations for the name of his own production company), or any other flick he's been in, this side of HOTEL TRANSYLVANIA.But, just as Will Farrell did for me with ELF, so Sandler has done for me with this salute to the classic video arcade games of the 1980's. And, part of that is due to Sandler et al. recruiting Peter Dinklage as Eddie. The latter, whom I first saw on the shamefully underrated 2005 s.f. series THRESHOLD, co-starred in ELF as a bad-tempered author of children's stories. And, I absolutely loved how he kicked Farrell's elfin butt in that Xmas flick!Well, Mr. Dinklage does the same thing here. Only, in this case, he plays Eddie Plant, the video game equivalent of a pool shark who is shamelessly egotistical. He does whatever it takes to win the game. And, in a way, Sam Brenner (Sandler's character) winds up doing the same thing. More specifcally; having to undergo a show-down with the title character of the one arcade game he could never win as a kid. Donkey Kong!Of course, most of his inspiration comes from the lovely divorced army colonel (played by Michelle Monaghan, whom I've admittedly never heard of before; although I, too, would brush my teeth four times a day for her!) who works for the Defense Department. And, as expected in a somewhat romantic comedy, they get their own personal happy ending. As do Josh Gad ("Ludlow") and Alice Benson ("Lady Lisa," a XENA: WARRIOR PRINCESS-type video game).Now, don't get me wrong. Some of the jokes I heard were utter failures at making me laugh. But, the mental picture I got of Mr. Dinklage, Martha Stewart, and Serena Williams made me all but roll on the floor of the theater laughing!Which, alone, is why I find this movie four stars funnier than TRAINWRECK. A film so bitterly disillusioning, as romantic comedies with supposedly sympathetic characters go, that I feared I might not see anything worthy of being called truly comedic, on the silver screen, this summer. But, I was ultimately proved wrong. And, as Brian Cox-- playing Admiral Porter--might say: "This film blows TRAINWRECK out of the water!"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Game Over.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pixels (2015): Dir: Chris Columbia / Cast: Adam Sandler, Kevin James, Josh Gad, Michelle Monaghan, Peter Dinklage: Nostalgia flushed down the toilet with this passionless reflection on classic video games. Apparently Pac-Man, Donkey Kong, etc are taking over earth and the military is automatically deemed useless. Only a group of childhood friends now adults can stop this mess because they apparently know the methods of the game. Chris Columbus has been a director of entertaining films whether it be within the Harry Potter films or his work with Robin Williams. Here the game is over before it starts for Columbus. Kevin James as the United States President is a comedic accident all its own. He apparently cannot read and becomes the public laughing stalk. There can be a grain of truth to this when it comes to reading scripts this bad. Adam Sandler leads the group as a sort of repairman because he was great at the arcades as a youngster. Michelle Monaghan plays a mother who is working for the president. Her first impressions of Sandler involves her spilling her guts about her cheating husband. This becomes predictable opposites attract situation that grows stale quickly. Josh Gad plays the grown version of the classic nerd kid. The one sound performance comes from Peter Dinklage as Sandler's childhood competition turned criminal as an adult. He finds redemption but unfortunately that doesn't save the horrid special effects. There was so much potential given the premise but the screenplay is lazy with actors whose game is getting closer to ending when they are unable to counter the bad arcade visions. Score: 3 ? / 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An absurd story ,but Pixels is still very enjoyable just leave your brains at home.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now when one walks into a Adam Sandler movie if your are excepting a comedy classic especially after seeing his last couple of films, then you are done right crazy. Pixels however isn't as bad as his last couple, but its far from his best work.Pixels when it comes to story, or screenplay its down right absurd.The film is full of loopholes at every corner. Please throw your sensibilities out of the window when watching the film. For example Kevin James is playing the president of America, if you feel my drift.While the script did need some work on, Pixels at the end of the day is still pretty enjoyable. Its full of good comedy, the VFX is great, and if you grew up in the 90s or 80s seeing characters of Donkey Kong, Pacman on screen bring back sweet some nostalgia.Story wise the film is pretty much about 3 nerd gamers saving the world from alien invaders, who are sending video game characters to destroy the world..... Yeah like i mentioned earlier the story is ABSURD.Acting wise Adam Sandler, Kevin James,Peter Dinklage, and Josh Gad act well in there comic avatar.Overall this is the perfect leave your brains at home and just enjoy type of film. If your looking even for a outa of sensibilities in this film don't watch it!!! If you don't like video games, do not watch also. For the rest enjoy.Dir Chris Columbus has had better films but this one is definitely not as bad as some critic made it out to be.3/5* or 6/10</fullReview>

I mean look at Paul Blart. Did anyone even bother to watch that terrible piece of (LOL)...cinema. I loved these games as a kid, but this film is appalling. I don't understand what anyone found interesting on this subject enough for it to be made into a film? The subject should have been alone and your money would have been saved.

It has both good acting and good actors involved in lead roles.To be honest with you, the reason this gets a higher rating from me is because of the art involved. I was an artist as a child, you might say, and I am just so amazed and tickled at what I find in children's/family movies today!To be honest with you, the reason this gets a higher rating from me is because of the little orange creature that got left behind. I realize it's just a film but was still a little sad the creature got turned into a woman because someone missed his childhood heroine, the obsession of his life.Every film has some catch or tool that makes you like it, like I spoke of in Minions.

In all honesty the game scenarios when they face Pac-Man and Donkey Kong were cool, however everything else in this movie was dreadful. The script was terrible, the women characters are just there to stand and look pretty, Sandler was unfunny and looked like he just wanted a paycheck, everyone else seemed to be phoning it in, but Peter Dinklage was the only person who was funny the whole time and even that isn't saying much, as he only made me laugh twice. Kids might enjoy this movie, but kids will enjoy anything.Pixels had a great idea, but the dialogue was not good at all, the acting was awful, and the characters had zero chemistry.

		<fullReview>I guess I am in the right age group for Pixels. I played the games featured in this movie in the arcades in my youth. Pixels should had been a lot of nostalgic fun but the Sandler formula is getting old now and I am amazed that there are some 1980s songs still left that have never featured in Sandler's previous films.Adam Sandler plays a whizz-kid arcade games player who in his younger days came second in the world arcade championship, footage of which was sent to space.Now years later an alien planet interpret the footage as an aggressive act and sent sprite like arcade characters to earth to attack it. So you have Pacman on the rampage, Centipede all over London, Donkey Kong is still on the lookout for a plumber.It is up to grown up arcade aces from the old days such as Sandler, his best friend Kevin James, incidentally also the President of the USA, Josh Gad and Peter Dinklage to battle these space invaders. Michelle Monaghan plays the love interest. Sean Bean and Brian Cox are the military types who never mastered Commando.Once the film has the big arcade showdown during the climax of the film, its a lot of fun. Q*Bert pops up to give Minion type of support to keep the smaller kids happy.The problem is the film takes too long to get going, the romance angle between Monaghan and Sandler is predictable. The film is actually not funny and there are a lot of problems with it. Why does the Japanese creator of Pacman gets his arm taken off for showing love to his creation but Gad gets to get his Lady Lisa to drop her swords? It looks like they dig dug themselves in a hole.There are a few star cameos which tends to be par to the course in Sandler films but he is a star whose creativity has been on the wane for some time now. It certainly is no can Mr Do.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a person who "lived" the life of those young boys, pumping handfuls of coins into arcade machines for hours at a time, I really was excited to see this movie with my kids. As a relatively relaxed guy I thought this would be a fun ride, with great graphics, probably a terrible story line and a few funny (but no doubt lame) dad jokes. The movie certainly delivered on those things - but what I wasn't prepared for was the constant referencing to alcohol in the movie - think about it if you have seen this movie - drinking in the closet, he drinks (and then drives), shots of Jack at the Whitehouse, Chugging a jug and a woman skulling a bottle of beer. It seems we have moved from every movie having some ridiculous requirement to have someone smoking (think Avatar) to making it so it is really cool to drink in a closet to overcome your sadness for a marriage break up. What the hell is going on here? I also had an issue with the overt sexualisation of some of the scenes, when the singer in the band starts humping the ground was definitely one scene too far... I love funny, dirty, rude and crude films (my fav comedy is This is the End) - but to sit there and watch this with an 8 and 10 year old made things extremely uncomfortable and required a long discussion at the end of the movie about why people drink alcohol. Just for the record we have a wine cellar in the house and a full bar fridge - we just don't "skull" beer or drink purely to overcome sadness or emotions.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Before I saw this film I saw some reviews from film critics, so I generally thought it'll be awful. When I was reading through the reviews in this site, I generally thought it maybe won't be so bad. Well I finally watched the movie and... Well the title says it all basically. Honestly, this movie was goddamn terrible. Half of the movie didn't make any sense, you couldn't feel any emotions for any character (not sure if that was the purpose), and one thing only drunk and complete morons could do: Kevin James as the US President ?!?!?! Who was stupid enough to think it'll make sense ?!?! Also this film is generally pretty idiotic and at times cheesy as hell. One last thing out all the dumb stuff that happened throughout this film, is that when Lady Lisa suddenly shows up, and after she have a little ''battle'' (pretty much she just shows Ludlow her moves), Ludlow suddenly says a kinda stupid line, then she begins to smile, and kiss him....? I put a question mark because when I saw this my jaw dropped from the level of stupidity of this scene. OK now look, the reason I gave it 2/10 is because the opening scene was the least awful scene in the entire movie, and because the way they created the classic video game characters were kinda nice. Overall, terrible movie, you can't have emotions for no character because almost 90% of the movie was utter non-sense, and if you let your kids watch this- you basically say ''Screw You Childhood !''</fullReview>

No idea of who they were marketing for and thus it was just cringeworthy. Grow up Adam et al or be a kid again but right now you are neither and this stunk.

So the production company comes with another one, with Chris Columbus in the vanguard ? Pixels. But even Columbus fails to elevate the trodden.This movie is another big fiasco in the long list of fiascos by Happy Madison. Not only Pixels isn't funny, but it is also dumb on so many levels. There are maximum 4-5 places in the entire movie where you might actually laugh. There you go! Counted them on fingers.So they tried putting some melodrama to it, and it looked so unnatural and stupid that you wish why bother? The concept was pretty stupid for a sci-fi flick. The plot had nothing to offer. Don't even get me started on the screenplay.It does light you up with reminiscence if you have lived the Arcade gaming era. All those games did bring a smile of nostalgia to my face. But that was it.Oh and Peter Dinklage could have lived without this.Just remember the bottomline ? If you are feeling a little bit down or without a brain, and wish to watch something light, Madison movies go amazingly well with popcorn.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Combine "Independence Day" with "Ghostbusters" and then insert Adam Sandler in another of his immature man-child roles as the hero, and you've got the premise of "Mrs. Doubtfire" director Chris Columbus' predictable, but palatable "Pixels," a nostalgic sci-fi fantasy about the bygone video game arcade era. Initially, you might think Columbus and "Mr. Deeds" writer Tim Herlihy and "Just Go with It" scribe Timothy Dowling have done little more than synthesize elements of "Independence Day" and "Ghostbusters" for the "Saturday Night Live" alumnus. Actually, the filmmakers have adapted French director Patrick Jean's ephemeral, two-minute short "Pixels" (2010) about space invaders masquerading as vintage video game characters. Sadly, everything about Columbus' "Pixels" adaptation is wholesome and lukewarm rather than imaginative and mischievous. Since he slipped into middle-age, the 48-year old Sandler hasn't made anything as audacious as his early, lowest-common-denominator farces: "Billy Madison" (1995), "Happy Gilmore" (1996), "The Waterboy" (1998), "Big Daddy" (1999), and "Little Nicky" (2000). Later, Sandler appeared in comedies with a slightly higher IQ such as his critically acclaimed "Punch Drunk Love" (2002), "Anger Management" (2003) with Jack Nicholson, "50 First Dates" (2004) with Drew Barrymore, "Click" (2006) with Christopher Walken, and "I Now Pronounce You Chuck &amp; Larry" (2007) with Kevin James. Just as he explored new facets with his image in "Punch Drunk Love," Sandler ventured even further afield with Judd Apatow's heavyweight "Funny People" (2009) as a comedian stricken with cancer.Sandler's recent big screen efforts have overshadowed neither "Punch Drunk Love" nor "Funny Business." Indeed, "Pixels" is just as routine as "Just Go for It" (2011), "Grown-Ups" (2010), its sequel "Grown-Ups 2" as well as "Jack and Jill" (2011) and "That's My Boy" (2012). Although nothing about "Pixels" is likely to affront or alienate anybody like "Jack and Jill" or "That's My Boy," Sandler's shenanigans as a video gamer wronged in his youth comes off as severely superficial. Nevertheless, Columbus has fashioned a coherent but humorless escapade with some amusing characters that are eclipsed by impressive CGI renderings of several 8-bit video characters, including "PAC-MAN," "Donkey Kong," "Galaga," "Centipede," and "Space Invaders." Children of the 1980s who grew up in places around the Friendly City, like Two-Bits behind the old McDonalds on Highway 45 North, The Back Porch in the old McRae's Mall, and Diamond Jim's in the Leigh Mall may cherish fond memories of those days. "Pixels" unfolds in 1982 as 13-year old Sam Brenner (Anthony Ippolito) and his best friend Will Cooper (Jared Riley) leap astride their banana-seat bikes and ride off to the first video game arcade to open in their town. Not only does Sam discover he has a knack for defeating Pac-Man and Centipede, but Cooper and he make friends with forlorn 8-year-old Ludlow Lamonsoff (Jacob Shinder) whose only friend is his grandmother. Eventually, Sam takes his gift for winning video games to a Donkey Kong Championship. Unfortunately, he lands in second place behind his chief adversary, snotty, self-centered, 13-year-old Eddie (Andrew Bambridge), who christens himself 'The Fire Blaster.' Interestingly enough, NASA loads up footage of their video game competition in a time capsule and launches it into deep space. Optimistically, NASA hopes to establish peaceful contact with an alien civilization. Meantime, after Eddie trounced him, Sam has turned into a perennial slacker. Basically, Sam lives a low-profile life. Although he got married, his wife cheated on him with their pediatrician. Now, he installs home entertainment systems for a living. Actually, Sandler looks clownish in his bright orange Nerds company outfit that resembles a UPS drivers' uniform. Meantime, Sam's obese buddy Will has plunged into politics and now serves as President. Nevertheless, Will has an appalling habit of putting his foot in his mouth whenever he ventures out into the public eye. Recently, during a reading initiative at a kindergarten, Cooper reprimanded a little girl for correcting his pronunciation. Their friend Ludlow (Josh Gad of "The Wedding Ringer") has turned into a conspiracy theorist.Without warning, a mysterious interplanetary force destroys a U.S. military base in Guam. Not only does it convert the base into hundreds of cubes, but it also abducts a security guard. President Cooper assembles his advisers and summons Sam. One of the President's advisers is Lieutenant Colonel Violet Van Patten (Michelle Monaghan of "Source Code") who has just separated from her philandering husband. Violet's hubby cheated on her with his 19-year old Pilates instructor. Before they race each other to the White House, Sam and Violet meet at her house after he arrived to install a home entertainment system. Violet and Sam sit in her closet and swap sentimental stories so Violet's teenage son Matty (Matt Lintz of "The Crazies") won't see her grieve. Anyway, an enigmatic alien race has acquired the NASA footage, but they have misconstrued it as an invitation to war. Miraculously, Sam's superb video skills make him a highly sought-after individual, and President Cooper assigns Sam and Ludlow to teach Navy SEALS for combat against the aliens. Lieutenant Colonel Van Patten has analyzed the cube debris from Guam, and she has created light-blasting ray guns that smash the aliens to smithereens. President Cooper refuses to act quickly enough to prevent another attack and the aliens destroy the Taj Mahal. Naturally, our heroes whip the aliens with relative nonchalance in one confrontation after another in this PG-13 rated hokum. The showdowns with Pac-Man and Donkey Kong yield the most suspense, and the special effects look fabulous. The funniest scene occurs when the fictional father of Pac-Man, Professor Iwatani (Denis Akiyama of "Johnny Mnemonic"), tries to reason with a gargantuan replica of his computer-generated son and it munches his forearm. Columbus appropriated this scene from Howard Hawks' 1951 chiller "The Thing from Another World." Not even villainous Peter Dinklage as the diminutive adult version of Eddie can generate any spontaneity in this attractive but anemic laffer. Altogether, "Pixels" qualifies as one of Sandler's least memorable movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Call me a Nintendo cartridge, because this movie can blow me. I didn't like the film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the film, NASA launches a time capsule into outer space in the hope of making peaceful First Contact with alien life in 1982. Included in the capsule is a representative cross-section of Earthly delights from the era, including a number of classic arcade games. Unfortunately, the aliens interpret the arcade games as a declaration of war, and decide to attack earth, using various video game characters as weapons. While, its sounds like a cool concept, sadly, this movie is not worth your quarters. This brainless video game movie killed me. Good thing, I have two more lives, left. Don't get me wrong, the movie directed by Chris Columbus, had some entertaining moments, but unfortunately, the negatives about the film, outlive the positives. Based on the 2010 short film of the same name by Patrick Jean. Pixels has an story that sounds suspiciously like a rip-off of a sequence from Futurama's 2002's Season 4, Episode 3 "Anthology of Interest II" in which the Earth was invade by aliens, cloak as old school classic video game characters. I wonder if the writers of Futurama, ever sued them for plagiarism claims. Anyways, the visual effects are by far, the best thing in the film, but part of the reason the movie is off-putting to some video games fans, is because the movie barely did any research on the games, in which the character came from. A good example of this, was Pac-Man &amp; Donkey Kong. Not only did, they screw up the gameplay, by not having a kill screen. They also establish a major plot point that wasn't in the original games, which is cheat codes. It's made worse by the fact that the film never explains, how these cheat codes were able to be use, during the real live battles. Plus, I really doubt, four color-coded Mini Coopers offered as ghost analogues could defeat a giant Pac-Man. Technically; they still wasn't ghosts, but I was willing to suspension my disbelief to try to enjoy the film. One thing, that really bug me, was Q*bert. Why in the earth, did the writers allow Q*bert to talk? Wouldn't he, be cursing, if he did? Gees?it's like they didn't do any research!? They made it, worst, by turning Q*bert into a female love interest, during the film. I didn't think, that the movie would go so low, to make a 1980s retro-gamer's wet dream, into reality. That's pretty mess up. With that say, some of the 1980s references, don't make any sense, within its timeline. If the time capsule was sent in 1982, how were the aliens, able to make video games characters from later games, like 1985's Tetris or 1984's Duck Hunt or gain access to later video clips of 1980's celebrities. While, this might seem like nitpicking, the movie is so full of anachronisms like these! It's too jarring, not to ignored. Honestly, the movie would had, been more enjoyable, if the acting was a little better. The presence of Adam Sandler as the lead, former arcade champion Sam Brenner was not good. He looks tired and out of it. Sandler in particular comes off downright bored, even during the film's action scenes. He didn't have any heart. His character was very generic for Sandler. Per usual, Sandler plays an immature man/boy who treat women like crap. He was very unlikable. Kevin James as US President William Cooper was a little better. While, he's totally unbelievable as the president, it's nice to see him, not in annoying role. Sadly, that role was given to Josh Gad as Ludlow Lamonsoff, an anti-social conspiracy theorist nut. Every time, he was on screen, his character kill any enjoyment. His character, has garnered so much hate, due to his constant screaming. His creepy sexual tendencies toward everybody, just make it even worse. Peter Dinklage's character, Eddie Plant is usually considered the highlight of the movie, thanks to his actor putting effort into his performance. I love how Peter Dinklage's character looks very similar to Donkey Kong high score record holder Billy Mitchell from 2007's The King of Kong: A Fistful of Quarters, documentary. I wonder if Billy Mitchell, ever sued them for his likeness. Anyways, I really hate the film, for the nerd stereotypes. It's very insulting, for a film to make fun of their target audience. If you're a female. You probably hate this movie, more for their tiresome female stereotypes. Characters like Col. Violet van Patten (Michelle Monaghan) &amp; First Lady Jane Cooper (Jane Krakowski) are high ranking, successful women, but they're often portray as a train-wreck, codependent, women whom only purpose in the film, to fall in love with the male main characters. Violet, alone, often get degraded by names by Sam, to the point, that I really didn't see, much chemistry between them. Even Ludlow's childhood crush, the kick-ass, but silent, Lady Lisa (played by Ashley Benson), is just there to be, literal "trophy" wife. It's really sucks to be female in this movie. The film is full of a lot of unsubtly unfunny raunchy sex jokes that wasn't well-receive. The movie has some toilet humor, but thank goodness, nothing too gross. Still, the family-Unfriendly Death scenes, mild swearing and various other inappropriate stuff, didn't stop, this film getting a PG-13 rated. The movie got a lot of publicity with child, but I doubt they will get any of the 1980's references. I did like all the 1980's pop culture references, including the wicked 1980's style, soundtrack that played, throughout the film. Another thing that I love, is the celebrity cameos. It's cool to see them, here. The ending is pretty predictable. I'm surprised, they didn't go with the dark gritty ending of the short film. That would have been interesting. Anyways, the post-credits scene is disturbing, enough. Overall: I'm sorry, but I'll not insert any more coins to rewatch this lazy, creatively-bankrupt movie. That's it! It's Game Over, man! Game Over! Watch Disney 2012's Wreck it Ralph, instead!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stupid, sexist and basically unfunny but the graphics are GREAT</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>NASA, in 1982, sends a bunch of video games into outer space. Years later aliens discover it and see it as a declaration of war (???). They send outsize versions of the video games to Earth to attack. It's up to the president (Kevin James) to get help. He hires his old friend (Adam Sandler) who used to be a whiz a video games to help battle the aliens. Along with some fellow gamers (Josh Gad and Peter Dinklage) they do battle. There's also the obligatory love interest (Michelle Monaghan).Like all Sandler films this is full of sexist smutty humor--not one bit of it was funny. I think I chuckled once or twice but that was it. Also Sandler gives a terrible lifeless performance. The plot is full of HUGE loopholes that make little sense. And Josh Gad is fat, loud, ugly and as annoying as hell. Still there are good things here. It does move quickly; guest stars Sean Bean, Serena Williams and Jane Krakowski are amusing; James and Monaghan are great in their roles and there are some great 80s songs on the soundtrack. But the main reason to see the film is the video games graphics. They look GREAT and the battle scenes are lots of fun. Best of all is an all out attack at the end by the aliens where virtually every 80s video game character makes an appearance. It's worth seeing just once for that alone. Otherwise it's pretty stupid and pointless.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When a race of aliens intercept a videotape containing footage of classic video games and misinterpret them as a declaration of war, they decide to attack Earth using those games as weapons. In order to combat them, President Will Cooper (Kevin James) recruits his old childhood friend and former classic video game champion and current "nerd installer" Sam Brenner (Adam Sandler), to lead a team of classic video game players Ludlow Lamonsoff (Josh Gad) and Eddie Plant (Peter Dinklage) and also a colonel and weapons developer Violet van Patten (Michelle Monaghan) to try to save the planet.After reading some of the other reviews for this film, I found that most people did not like this film. I understood some of their points but I didn't think it is as bad as they made it out to be. I just want to say that despite the fact that the trailer makes it look like the film is for kids, it is not. This film is recommended for at least teens. Adam Sandler's films this last decade have been rather hit or miss but mostly misses and this one is not a miss but is not quite a hit either. Just like his films, the jokes in this one are hit or miss but in this case, they are mostly hits with some misses. The acting in this film wasn't remarkable either. Adam Sandler plays the same character he has played in numerous other films. The role could have probably been played by another actor and be just as good if not better. Kevin James is serviceable as President Cooper. Josh Gad was good as the clumsy, fat guy Ludlow and got to recite some of the film's funniest one-liners. Peter Dinklage's Eddie was arguably trying too hard. Michelle Monaghan's Violet was OK but had no chemistry with Sam which made their romantic scenes a little cringe-worthy and unbelievable. Sure the story doesn't make too much sense either but the film wasn't meant to be taken seriously and does a decent job of not taking itself too seriously either. For me, the best part of the film has to be the special effects. The way in which they bring all the classic video games to life was rather good. All of the classic video games of the 80s were well represented which was appreciated. The way in which people go in and out of pixelation and how environments got destroyed via pixelation was nice to see. I was also curious as to how they were able to alter old 80s video footage as well (I won't spoil why this happens). This film is nowhere near the best film of the year and will probably not be on any best of thew year lists but I was entertained. If you just turn off your brain and suspend belief and except what you are given, I think you'd all enjoy it too.keithlovesmovies.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Simply awful!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My favorite part of this movie was the product placement shot of Dan Akyrod's vodka. Other than that, I can't say anything good about this film. The visual effects were ho-hum. Sandler phoned this one in (and this is a guy who can act as seen in "Punch Drunk Love") and that's being nice. The best performance was by the kid who played the young Adam Sandler. The only way I was able to sit through this film was to phony laugh at all the "jokes." With so many good sci-fi choices in theaters right now, stay away from Pixels. I wanted to like this film as I enjoyed the games featured when I was a kid, but I couldn't. This one should sweep the Razzies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Nostalgic, but not how you think. I really wanted to like this movie. I actually want to like all Adam Sandler movies. But lately he is making that almost impossible. Even with a decent buzz I couldn't get into this movie. Action scenes just were okay, but the jokes were so bad and forced they didn't land. I'm getting tired of Sandlers ultimate cool guy complex he seems to play in every move lately. Even as a nerd he comes off super cocky. The only nostalgia that this movie gave me wasn't for the 1980's rather it was for the 1990's when Adam Sandler movies were still good. I hope his next movie he uses the reset button and goes back to his roots.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Adam Sandler and crew don't even try to pretend to try anymore. This film is so bad, that I don't even know if Rifftrax/MST3K would be able to do anything with it. I believe the reviews on the first two pages of reviews are either fake, or paid for by the studio to desperately try to compensate for how bad this film was trashed by critics and users alike. Notice that almost all of them follow the same pattern of saying things like "don't believe the reviews / don't trust the critics / etc." I'd be very suspicious of all those reviews. Think about it, how would a film get so universally trashed by critics and fans alike, and then suddenly there are a bunch of recent 10 star reviews--very suspicious. I don't always care for critics either, but in this case, they are absolutely right . . . this film stinks big-time.The scene where Sandler's love interest is introduced is so flat and predictable, it literally would have been better if Sandler just looked right into the camera and said to the audience: "is it cool if you all just accept that this is gonna be my love interest in the film, that just happens to also be an adviser to the president? Yes? O.K. so we can skip this scene? Good. Moving on . . ." The scene where Kevin James is introduced as Sandler's . . . 80's buddy who's now a business man? nope . . . 80's buddy who's now a video game executive? nope . . . 80's buddy who's now THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES?!?! yep . . . you read that right . . . Kevin James just gets casually introduced as PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES! This scene is so pathetically unbelievable that I couldn't even fathom how awful it was.Keep in mind that I was a fan of Sandler's earlier work, especially Wedding Singer, SNL, and even up to 50 First Dates, when he actually still tried and made an effort. He literally didn't even lift a finger's worth of effort in this atrocity. He doesn't even pretend to try anymore. Also keep in mind that I did like the initial concept of the 80's time capsule being found and the games brought to life as weapons.I believe that Sandler and crew (i.e. James, et al) simply just decide where they want their next group paid vacation / party to be: New York, London, African Safari (i.e. Blended), etc. etc., have someone write a really cheap, undeveloped excuse for a plot/script, plug in actors from their crew and or friends/relatives of theirs they want to give a shot at stardom, and go on their group vacation / party while kinda/sorta making a movie at the same time.Dinklage makes an effort, but the writers make his character so stupid and one dimensional that it is almost a miracle that he was able to do anything with it.The only other actor who makes an effort in this film is Josh Gad, and he has the only genuinely funny scene in the movie where he gets to give a bunch of Navy Seals the "Drill Sergeant" treatment.Other than that 45 seconds, this film is pathetic. Probably in my top 10 worst movies I've ever seen list.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Big Budget Wasted On A Dumbed Down Comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When aliens misinterpret video feeds of classic arcade games as a declaration of war, they attack the Earth in the form of the video games. Director Chris Columbus latest feature aims for the nostalgic vibe to spark audience interest, however the target market of this film is mainly children much of which have not played these classic arcade games that are so heavily focused on.Comedy is of course subjective and some people may find the jokes hilarious but they seem to be dumbed down to hit a lower aged audience, much of the films gags are simply pointing out something and laughing about it, which seems to be a common trait in much of Adam Sandler's work these days.One of the biggest problems in this film is the fact that Adam Sandler looks like he doesn't want to be there, he has shown his dramatic ability in the past in films such as Funny People and one of my favorites Punch Drunk Love which showcases his undeniable acting talent. It is a shame that he continuously goes back to making typical comedy films when he is capable of so much more.Kevin James plays the President of the United States which really tells you all you need to know and Josh Gad's comedic style becomes frustrating despite some good moments. One of the best parts of this film is Peter Dinklage who really shines whenever he is on screen, he has some great line delivery and is generally funny throughout. The special effect look OK with some sequences looking better than others but the visuals never really dazzled me as a viewer.Overall this film is another big budget wasted on a poor script, dumbed down jokes and uninteresting characters which culminate in an action comedy that simply falls flat for me. I am going to give Pixels a 5/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>980's video games are back and they want to destroy the world. Walking into the cinema... I am trying to think of something that makes me want to see this film. Nope, I cannot seem to find anything.Overall Rating: 1 starIn 1982, the world was was enjoying the new arcade games of Pac-Man, Galaga, Centipede and Donkey Kong. Sam Brenner (Adam Sandler) and Will "Chewy" Cooper (Kevin James) lived for playing the latest arcade game and finding opportunities to show off their gaming skills. They decide to show off their talents at the World Video Game Championships where they come in contact with Ludlow Lamonsoff (Josh Gad) and Eddie "The Fire Blaster" Plant (Peter Dinklage). During the competition they show their knack for seeing patterns in the games and their joy stick dexterity. At the same time in human history, NASA sent off a probe into space to attempt to connect with intelligent life in outer space. In this probe they sent glimpses into the 80's culture of our world which included components of these iconic video games. Fast forward to 2015, the lives of this band of nerdy brothers have gone down different paths. Sam is an installation technician and Will has become the President of the United States. Even though they are still close friends, their life responsibilities carry different levels of significance, until they are drawn back together when aliens attack the earth. The explanation for the attack is that the extra-terrestrials received the 1982 message from NASA and saw it as declaration of war on their planet. Their response to this unintentional call to arms is to send the classic video games to attack earth as pixelated weapons. Sam and Will have to re-connect with their former video game competitors and work with the world armed forces to fight off the nostalgic alien invasion. Similar to the life cycle in the video games, the team is given three attempts by the space invaders to apply their former gaming skills and to discover the answers to saving the world from an Atari- inspired annihilation. Pixels, as a concept, is refreshingly original and has the potential to serve as a digital bridge between multiple generations. The other potential hope for this film is director Chris Columbus at the helm, he has produced some great family films throughout his career. This hope was for Columbus to take this convoluted storyline, which has the potential to go the way of fun and nostalgic hilarity or he could produce a mess of a film with catastrophic proportions, and make a great family comedy. Unfortunately, Pixels falls into the latter category as a mess. Columbus attempts to deliver a 1980's retro style film with ridiculous characters and situations with a modern computer-generated spin, but fails to deliver. This failure has to do with the inclusion of Adam Sandler and Kevin James as the lead characters. At this stage in their acting careers, they seem unable to deliver original comedic performances. Their roles are as predictable as the patterns in the old video games. They walk through their performances in this film with little enthusiasm and with a reliance on dated comedic styles that have worn out their welcome. Josh Gad provides the potential for originality, but he falls into the trap of overacting which attempts to compensate for Sandler and James' weak performances. Also, the only reasonable explanation for Peter Dinklage and Michelle Monaghan being part of this project was to potentially procure a comedy on their resume. Unfortunately, they are poorly cast in parts that any credible actor should have given a miss. If all of these components were not bad enough, the truly frustrating thing about Pixels is not in the weak story line or the poor performances, but the fact that this is promoted as a family film. The humour and innuendo is not funny and is not appropriate for children. The marketing conveys that this film should be accessible for any generation to enjoy on a Saturday afternoon, but what happens is the potential for embarrassing conversations with small children on a multitude of levels. For example, why Eddie Plant is going to the White House's Lincoln bedroom with Martha Stewart and Serena Williams or the stalker-type mentality of the Ludlow character. So much of the film was creepy to experience as an adult, much less trying to explain it to children. This review should not be misconstrued as prudish, but more of holding the marketing team to account for the disservice to families. In the concept stages, Pixels may have had the potential to be a fun adventure for people who grew up in the 80's and potentially for a new generation, too. In the end, it proves to be an embarrassment for those linked to this production and for anyone who might go to see it. Leaving the cinema... Avoid the potential awkward conversations with your children and give Pixels a miss. It is one of the rare films that I would not recommend for any audience. Do not be fooled, it is not funny or a family film. Game Over. Bigger questions: 1. Do we all have a role in this life? (Proverbs 16:9, Romans 8:28) 2. What is the Bible's view on war? (Ecclesiastes 3:8, Matthew 26:52) 3. Why do people still go to Adam Sandler and Kevin James films?

		<shortDescription>Just a mindless pop-corn movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Despite all the negative reception I've heard from every type of movie critics, I still went to see Pixels, prepared to face the possible amount of awfulness I would give.So I bought my ticket, pick some snacks and entered the theater room to see the movie. AND IT WAS...Okay.Just, okay.Far to be great but far to be terrible either.Have you seen Independence Day? Well, that's the same thing but with video games. The character interactions are awkward and kinda bland, the characters themselves are just stereotypes, but it's compensated with great action scenes and special effects.Really, the action scenes are the highlight of the whole film ! Taking those simple arcade games like Pac-Man, Donkey Kong and Centipede and turn them into some epic and exciting scenes, you really can't go wrong !It's actually the very first time I ever see Adam Sandler (starring as Sam Brenner) in a live-action movie. I didn't see any of his movies, but I knew I won't be dealing with a performance that's Academy Award-worthy. Not very expressive but not totally uninterested by the situation. It's the typical "funny jerk" guy. Keep in mind I said it in quote.Speaking of the comedy, I certainly won't recall it the funniest of cinema's history but it's surprisingly decent compared from what I heard about the other productions of Happy Madison. Not a single trace of toilet humor. And I will admit that I found few of the lines kinda clever. Oh, and Peter Dinklage's character (Eddie Plant) is a lot of fun to watch, you can't go wrong with them. The only thing I found embarrassing to watch are the moments with Josh Gad's character (never catch his name through the whole movie), proving that screaming your lines out loud doesn't make them funny. But still, nothing unwatchable.Also, I want to notice that even through there's a lot of references of 80's video games, that's MOST of the references that you will see. The rest of the references is from 80's culture in general. So if you're like me, born in the late 90's, you'll probably won't get them.I also want to notice that because it's distributed by Sony Pictures, there's a LOT of product placements for Sony products. They even mention the PlayStation 4 and show The Last of Us in one scene.Bottom line, from my opinion, it's not the giant pile of unwatchable awfulness that everybody is making up to be. It's just a mindless pop-corn movie. Exactly like I predicted it.6/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Adam Sandler Movie...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the 2nd worst film I've seen from 2015 so far. the first being "Paul Blart: Mall Cop",both Happy Madison Productions. Oh boy.Adam Sandler is certainly no Clark Gable when it comes to being a leading man. He is just a tired 48 year old man, he's better off playing a single father in his late 40s. That's what he looks like. HE DOESN"T LOOK LIKE HE'S GOING TO SAVE THE WORLD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Oh yeah, and Kevin James is the president. Yup. That is "Pixels" for you. A WASTE OF MY TIME!!!!!!!!!!The film is disturbingly clichéd. Oh is it clichéd. How is it that Adam Sandler gets Michelle Monaghan's character as his lover! That just doesn't make sense! Of course, in the beginning, they hate each other, but you know what happens. You know. It is so predictable, but that's what you're going to get.The first 3 minutes were kind of cool. But that's because I liked the song. That Cheap Trick song was the best part of the whole movie. The WHOLE MOVIE! But, hey, there were a few positive things about the movie. The first 20 minutes had a few brief funny moments, and the special effects were pretty neat. The concept and action sequences were pretty clever, but the battle scenes, overall, become boring. That's the thing about these modern big-budget movies, the action sequences just become boring after a while. They also try to fill these action sequences with "jokes". Of course, jokes has to be in quotes, because these "jokes" are basically Josh Gad falling down and yelling.Overall, this movie is an embarrassment, but Adam Sandler doesn't care, he just wants your money.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a kid, Sam was great at video games, only coming second to "Fire Blaster" Eddie at a world arcade championship which was video-taped by NASA as footage to be sent to outer space. Sam was friends with "Chewy" Cooper, the Crane game expert, and Ludlow, the loner kid who was obsessed to a game character named Lady Lisa. Now thirty years later Cooper and Sam still meet frequently although Cooper is now the president and Sam works as an electronics installer. One day The USAF base at Guam is attacked by alien entity. The next day Sam serves a house call where he meets Violet and her son Matty. He thought she's into him but he was wrong. They both eventually meet again at the White House as the president calls them to address the Guam problem. Sam gets kicked out of the meeting due to interrupting a general. That night Sam meets Ludlow who reveals that he knows about the aliens and that they're using the old arcade game footage to create the attackers. Sam and Ludlow advises the president about the next attack on India, but they're ignored and Taj Mahal gets pixelated. The government asks Sam and Ludlow to train Navy SEALS to win on old arcade games, but they eventually have to handle the situation themselves as the aliens attack London with Centipede game.Successful in London, the president equips them and adds "Fire Blaster" Eddie to their ranks and forms The Arcaders. They prepare for the next attack on New York City against Pac-Man. As Pac-Man glides along the streets of New York, The Arcaders use cars as ghosts to catch Pac-Man, Eddie manages to kill Pac-Man but it respawns, spending 1UP. Ludlow manages to distract it and Eddie again manages to hit it, seemingly able to move very fast to track the Pac-Man. But the last Pac-Man tricks Eddie's car into the river, and Sam manages to trick it to spend enough time to expire its power pill. They then celebrate with the president, but then another message comes from the aliens claiming the humans have violated the war rules and thus they will attack to claim earth. Matty figures out that Eddie cheated in Pac-Man, just before he gets kidnapped by the aliens. The aliens attack with their mother-ship hovering above the city.More video game characters come out from the mother-ship including Lady Lisa. Ludlow manages to tame her and they kiss. Eddie and even president Cooper joins the Arcaders to fight the aliens. Sam, Violet and Cooper sneak into the mother-ship and faces a live-sized Donkey Kong game with Matty and two other captives at the top. Sam gets reduced self esteem over the game but Matty opens the truth about Eddie cheating. This convinces Sam and he then overkills the Donkey Kong with the hammer. This freezes the aliens and they get called back into the mother-ship. The Arcaders gets awarded for their efforts and Eddie admits Sam as the best gamer in the world.The story as a whole is very lame. It's so predictable and didn't incite any more curiosity past the level that the trailer incited. The opening feels very nice with all those nostalgic elements, although then again, those nostalgia will only appeal to those people over thirty who ever experienced those oldies-but goodies arcade games. Yet they will look weird, if not stupid, to the eyes of younger audiences who never had the experience of facing pixelated characters.Furthermore the story unfolds very strangely at times. Ludlow's appearance, how Lady Lisa fit into the story, Cooper as a president; all those feels under developed at best. The characters also feel very much under developed. They only rely on the opening sequence to establish the character backgrounds. Yet they don't really incorporate the changes that those characters gone through over the years. This also happens to the characters that appear later when the main characters are adults like Violet and Matty.The comedy is just at an okay level if we see it as an ordinary comedy movie. But then there's the level of the cast like Adam Sandler and Josh Gad. The comedy feels very much lacking if we compare this movie to other Sandler movies. Adam Sandler did well on comedies based on simpler basic premises and romantic comedies. But he didn't handle this type of movie very well, I suppose. For me, I enjoy his previous The Cobbler better than this one.The SFX looks quite convincing but it doesn't rally help the movie as a whole since the script didn't really hold itself solidly. The acting overall feels very much at a standard level. Adam Sandler did his usual level of comedy movie, with grins all over the place. Josh Gad provides a nice performance for his angle but his role is only that significant. Peter Dinklage surprisingly acted his parts below his usual level. Maybe he's not really fit for comedies.My final say for Pixels (2015) is just a 5 out of 10 score, and not recommendation for this one. It's just that much of an entertainment due to lacking in many levels.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Adam Sandler: Another Masterpiece! Oh,no... Wait</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Where should I start? The movie has so many negative features and so little redeeming features that I find it difficult to think of any time I actually laughed while watching this poorly-produced, horribly written garbage fest. Can studios seriously produce such bad content and expect people not to retaliate? Peter Dinklage, a star actor in the Game Of Thrones universe is probably the best actor of the film, however, the 7 year old who wrote his character has done an awful job. Dinklage is a very talented actor given such a bad role. Moreover, I frankly cannot believe that Adam Sandler still gets away in acting in such terrible movies. Was he even acting in this movie? I don't know. It seems as though he was forced to act in this movie against his will. The ending. What.A.Terrible.Ending. It had me glad the movie was over so I wouldn't have to continue watching this terrible movie.The CGI was average, nothing special. However, we see so little actual CGI in the movie, the second half of the movie is just a useless time-filler with no real content or purpose. This is the same problem I faced while watching the Godzilla reboot. Good idea, horrible execution. I expected better from such actors, and the trailers straight up fooled me into wasting my money. STOP making such bad movies and saturating the market with over advertised garbage. 2/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not many decent reviews on this one. It is a lazy money grab by all major parties involved. I watch movies for a living and work on many commercially viable productions. This one had promise but fails to entertain due to flawed casting and writing. I would be saddened to see this lame excuse of a feature make break even. Save your dollars and stay clear of Pixels. Most of us saw the trailers and were intrigued by using 21st century cgi to bring back to life our old arcade favorites from the 80s. Yet, it takes more to entertain. You need a plausible story and good casting choices. Besides, you need decent chemistry among lead actors. Everything about this film felt disconnected and awkward. I wanted to like Sam Brenner and his side kicks, but could not help myself but feel indifferent. Could someone please write a decent script for the next Adam Sander comedy? This man is talented and deserves better, if he still has the hunger to be out there and pursue his craft. Good night and good luck from Vancouver.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Probably the worst movie that has been released in 2015. It is beyond my knowledge how Adam Sandler still has a career after this movie, but back to the review. The acting at points is terrible, could be intentional but i don't know. Every single joke in this movie can make a 7 year old chuckle but every one else in the cinema will just sigh.Pixels is definitely not worth the money, i wouldn't even accept payment to watch this movie, because its a complete waste of time and money, its a movie you will forget about the week after.TL;DR Horrible movie, at points bad acting, cringey jokes. If you have a 8-11 year old child he will probably love it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love video games. Always loved them since the 80s. Adam Sandler was great in "Happy Guilmore". This film has a great idea. I mean for someone who loves playing video games. The beginning was OK, i was hoping that the idea of being able to play games well in order to save the world would be developed well. Too bad it wasn't. The film is awful. Honestly, it is somewhere around T-5, I mean you watch it and somewhere after the middle you start thinking-my god, how much more nonsense will come up? And yes, there is a lot. I mean , come on, couldn't it be just a little bit more detailed? I mean the gaming-it's just standing in front of the arcade cabinet, pushing some buttons-it's saving the world now!!! Give it some creativity our dear filmmakers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worst film of 2015</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Quite possibly the worst film of this year... Pixels is nothing but another cheesy, lazy and awful attempt by Adam Sandler. Pixels plot doesn't even make sense, the film doesn't add up. Just watching Pixels I felt completely unimpressed and unrelaxed with the amount of lazy humour given by the cast, I remember feeling exhausted with the thought when is this perpetual film going to end. Pixels is also a disgrace to the gaming society, especially for those who are fans of arcade games because the film is unimaginative and unfond with the arcade characters, though this is the producers fault for not exploring with the characters. In my overall judgement the film has a lot of potential to offer; but unfortunately that is wasted by lazy directing, a poor storyline and the wrong film cast to create this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Underrated Sandler and Friends Battle 80s Video Game Icons</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Among the many scathing reviews critics have written regarding Adam Sandler films over the years, I'd say it's best to ignore them for once as this movie one-ups the dullness left behind by recent duds Grown Ups 2 and Mall Cop 2 combined. Speaking of the latter, seeing Paul Blart become President felt more like a barrel of laughs that I could never take my mind off of. Back to my review, the film starring Sandler, Kevin James, Josh Gad, Peter Dinklage, and Michelle Monaghan was certainly impressive with its visuals though with a story that looked too simple to write. Director Chris Columbus himself has had a string of hits (Home Alone, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone) and misses (Rent), but I'd say this one in particular has some significance and is more like a teeter-totter between thrills and monotony.Adam Sandler portrays washed-up 80s avid gamer Sam Brenner who now works as a software installer, but when he's summoned by his old friend-turned-President Will Cooper, he and fellow former 80s gamers must ally together to stop an alien threat taking on the form of familiar video game characters or it's GAME OVER for all.Usually these days, I avoid Sandler-starring/produced films in movie theaters and wait for its DVD release (my last one seeing in theaters was 2008's Don't Mess with the Zohan), but when I first heard of him being thrown into a battle against classic 80s video game characters, they already had me at "video games." After witnessing Wreck-It Ralph back in 2012, I was entranced and drooling in 80s/90s arcade nostalgia. Those same elements were used again for an Adam Sandler comedy, so I rushed immediately to the theater to see if it can actually work. In the end, it had a few misogynistic moments, predictable outcomes, interesting celeb cameos, and typical dysfunctional humor used in many Happy Madison Production films. But when you throw in Olaf and Tyrion Lannister into the mix, its brand of humor now feels very much like Wreck-It Ralph crossed with Ghostbusters. One scene, for example, that was pretty clever was luring Pac-Man into chasing the lead guys in their appropriately color-coded vehicles, thus making the city look like a giant maze for him to roam around like in his original arcade game. Though the characters may not have had the best one-liners in some scenes or lacking true chemistry, it's a visual joyride for new, young generation gamers. Whereas old-school gamers of the 80s-90s will appreciate the nods and tributes, but will notice the lack in depth to see it as a good movie. Nevertheless, I liked seeing these four main guys (armed with proton pack-like weapons) getting themselves caught in harsh predicaments when lives are on the line, albeit with humorous results. Shouldn't be overlooked for a summer flick. Try a few quarters and there might be something good out of this. Game on!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A waste of time.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To all of you who say this movie is good, it's not. This movie is a money maker, Adam Sandler picked something that is loved by almost every parent, teenagers and some children, Arcade games, to squeeze your wallets and beg for money. The characters are nothing new, Adam Sandler plays himself in this movie, just like every other actor, Peter Dinklage is the only that tries to make a new character but still fails.Yes, the awesome arcade characters are here, and that's the only thing this movie's good for, but they are in the movie for 25 minutes! I went to see Pixels waiting for a good story with some decent jokes or just some time to watch what they did with these legendary characters, and they fail.The jokes are awful, i only laughed once or twice and it was because of the plot holes of this story, did they watch this when they were done shooting? This is a summer blockbuster that will be forgotten very soon without any cool or memorable scenes. And basically the directors just waste our time with an Adam Sandler's horrible romance when we could have had awesome action, boss battles, Space invaders sky battle or something! this movie should be called "Adam Sandler and some games". And don't try to understand some parts of the movie, you wont get answers of what the hell just happened, maybe they though a "comedy" shouldn't have a story at all and they put this excuse to make some money.Nintendo tried to redeem itself from the horrible "Super Mario Bros." but now they have 2 movies not worth watching or even remembering. This movie is a straight 3/10 not recommended, don't waste your money on it, you should watch it later when it's free just to see how bad it is and why Adam Sandler can't make good movies like he used to.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>And there you thought playing video games is about getting high scores ... well you thought right, but this misses the goal - badly! You can take what I wrote and spin it of course (like I would do with one guy who wrote he doesn't understand the overall vote this has - yeah me too! Because anything above 5 is ridiculous), but you cannot take anything in the movie and spin it.The best thing in this is Peter Dinklage. And even he has to suffer through a lot of scenes that are just dreadful And not in a good sense either. Unless you're watching this as "50 Shades of Pac-Man" I suggest to stay as far away from it as possible. Maybe kids, who don't get the misogynistic and unfunny tone of the movie, might like some of it, but how they were able to turn a more than decent idea into a pile of ... well you know what - I can't really understand or fathom. I almost felt dirty (again not in a good way, just disgusting) after watching this, it's hard to express it with any other words.Predictable, unfunny (throwing insults into peoples faces, being racist or generally discriminating can be funny - if you're able to pull that off - obviously not the case here, unless intoxicated) and just generally bad, making good actors looking weak (Michelle, Peter Dinklage) is quite a feat ... not one I actually enjoy watching though</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Weak Sandler Film, Just With a Bigger Effects Budget</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Video games really don't have a good reputation when it comes to having film adaptations. Sure we have a few good one's like Wreck it Wralph or Scott Pilgrim, but for the most part they seem to go down the same route as the Super Mario Bros movie where the film loses all the charm that made the game enjoyable to begin with. Part of the reason for this is they always seem to be put into dreadful hands. This time those dreadful hands are Happy Madison Productions, Sandler's film studio that have been producing his cinematic turds for 15 years now. And once again they have produced another insulting comedy, lacking any real charm and being light on laughs.The plot unfolds because back in the 80's NASA sent several video games in to space to communicate to extraterrestrials. But their message of peace was misinterpreted as a declaration of war and the aliens send several video game characters to attack the earth. Thus President Cooper (Kevin James) recruits his childhood friend and gaming champion Brenner (Adam Sandler) to fight off the alien invasion.Right away we've really got to suspend disbelief to accept the plot. Not just because of having to accept the poorly explained justification of why the aliens are attacking as video games, but also buying Kevin James as president of the USA. It's never explained how he became President, but unless Donald Trump was the only other candidate there's no way he could've gotten voted into the position. Especially considering he plays the same annoying character he always does of the dumb guy who does nothing but hang out with Adam Sandlers character. None of the other characters are much better. Sandler has as much charisma as a plank of wood. Josh Gad's performance as the nerdy friend is annoying from the start. The only one who gets even a chuckle is Dinklage as the over the top douchey rival, but even that gets worn out quickly. Also just like all Sandler productions we get a lot of offensive stereotypes. This time the focus is on geek stereotypes, like gamers are antisocial weirdo's who have no lives and live in their mothers basement. Albeit this isn't the most offensive stereotype, but it's still insulting one of the film's biggest audiences. Besides this there are other typical offensive representations we see in all Sandler movies, like women being nothing more than eye candy. In fact there are only two female characters in lead roles. The first is Michelle Monaghan who's in the film only to give Sandlers character somebody to flirt with. The other is Ashley Benson who plays one of the video game characters who comes to life, who not only doesn't get a single line of dialogue in the film but also ends up being a literal trophy for one of the characters. Having some of gaming's most recognisable icons, you'd really think the film would actually do something good with them. But it doesn't. The gaming characters will just attack Sandler and co. only for the humans to fight back and that's it. It never tries to actually make any jokes with these characters, but instead does the same thing as a film like Disaster Movie where it will try to get a laugh by just naming something popular. The only video game icon they do anything else with is Q*bert, who is one of their trophies to help them. But all they have him do is typical annoying Sandler humour like watching Q*bert wet himself with pixels and some weak slapstick.Although at least the gaming icons they use actually look good. It's not like the Mario Bro's Movie where Goomba's looked like a pear on the body of Frankenstein and instead the 3d CGI models maintain the charm of the original designs. But to me this makes the film even worse than typical Sandler comedies because it ends up feeling like such wasted potential. Had a better production been given the chance to use these characters, we might have got a charming homage to video games. But instead we got a typical Sandler comedy, just as unfunny as always but with a bigger effects budget.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is just an incredibly lazy film. No-one involved with it seems to care about it, so why should I?The script is based on a short film ( although the animated series Futurama came up with this idea many years earlier) but the attempt to turn the short into a feature failed as soon as Adam Sandler was involved.Sandler appears to make zero effort in this flick. He looks bored, almost sedated. When scenes require complex visual effects Sandler merely goes through the motions, with a " they'll fix this in post" expression on his face. It just feels like he wants to get back to his trailer and go back to sleep.kevin James is in this, playing the US President! If that piece of casting alone doesn't tell you what a lazy, lowest common denominator money grab this is, then I don't know what will.The use of 80s video games is a cynical attempt to cash in on nostalgia. Sad to see Peter Dinklage and Sean Bean in this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This review is simple, because the movie didn't know what to be: (1) A COMEDY - not really. There were far too many minutes of mindless dialogue, lack of inventive gags, absence of appropriate wit; (2) A SCIENCE FICTION - absolutely not. There was no science, reasonable explanations, or context; (3) A ROMANCE - Not at all. Whatever human contact the characters had was superficial, boring, and trivial. The opportunity was there but promptly discarded. (4) TRAGEDY - Not in the least, except for perhaps a few minutes toward the end. (5) SPECTACLE - Yes.In effect these elements were touched on, but not one was fully embraced, and by no means explored (except the COLOR-SPECTACLE). There were perhaps 3-4 laughs to be had, one about every 30 minutes. I honestly can't say when it came off the rails, but it was very early on, I would guess when the two arrive at the White House. I was bored a multitude of times and sporadically entertained.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun, if hollow, entry to the summer line-up</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've learned to take in movies in context. It has made my movie-going experience more enjoyable and has made me a more appealing companion with whom to watch movies. Likewise, I adjust my rating scale based on a number of factors including genre, intended audience and self awareness.Pixels is a thoroughly enjoyable movie if you take it for what it is: a light-hearted sci- fi comedy that aims to please without being too self-conscious. At times funny, at times sweet, and always entertaining, Pixels manages to take viewers through a nostalgic ride that is well-paced and doesn't suffer from the seemingly never-ending (and often less funny) third act that is characteristic of this kind of movie.Most of the laughs come from Josh Gad and Peter Dinklage, who look very comfortable in their portrayals as quirky conspiracy theorist Ludlow and former video game master Eddie, respectively. Adam Sandler's character seems all too familiar considering the actor's recent string of movies so I won't expand on that, and Kevin James plays Cooper as you'd come to expect from Kevin James. Rounding out our cast of heroes is Michelle Monaghan as Lt. Col. Violet Van Patten, a great addition who may feel out of place in a scene or two, like when her very believable concern for the situation at hand stands in stark contrast with the farcical dialogue.The special effects in Pixels are top-notch, creating a world where you can't help but suspend your disbelief and become engrossed in the action. The references to popular arcade video games are sure to remind audience members who grew up playing them of a simpler time.In all honesty, I didn't expect much coming into this movie, so suffice it to say that I was pleasantly surprised. I wouldn't pay to see it twice, but I'd be sure to tune in if I ever come across it on Netflix or TV; heck I will probably spare the $2.00 at Red Box when it's released on BlueRay.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dull, boring, stupid, unfunny and worst of all offensive. This movie made me angry at how bad it was and it is incredible to think it was given to us by the same director of the first two Potter movies, which are by all means, in my opinion, two gems.Pixels is the nail in the coffin for any redemption Adam Sandler could have possibly had at this point in his career. I mean, I get it when you're not caring with your stupid hang out movies like Grown Ups, where the whole point is for you to have a paid vacation with your friends, but this? You manage to screw up a film that has this potential? How the hell do you do that?! Characters that are boring, underdeveloped, uninteresting thrown into situations that are clichéd to the point of exhaustion. The whole set up was probably directed by a machine. The further it goes on the further the characters get boring and so does everything around them. There were clue moments in this movie of action that should have been the climax moment were I was close to falling asleep. I cannot stress it enough: this film is BORING! Yet it gets worse: it isn't even funny! I laughed exactly zero times, maybe, maybe I smiled twice. The lengths to which the jokes are stupid, unremarkable, disgustingly delivered is baffling. I am not stupid Adam you know mother effer! I want to be treated nicely and respected when I go to the theater, instead you serve me with insults to my intelligence and a performance that is the pinnacle of you cashing it in. The script is a lazy mess probably put together in a weekend and is more misogynistic than some 40s movies, wow you truly found a way for people to hate you guys! Fortunately, for the love of god, the film has Peter Dinklage in a few scenes where he shows great comedic timing. Moreover Cubert steals any show that there ever was to steal and is legitimately a good part of the film. Finally, as much as I was about to collapse sleeping once every five minutes, the visual effects kept coming back and keeping me awake, because even if they weren't interesting in the story, they did stand out as truly amazing special effects, some of the best I've seen recently and there wasn't a single time I could make them out to be CGI.That isn't enough to save a disaster of a film, if you were on the edge of deciding whether to see this or not I'l tell you: don't go give your money to Sandler he doesn't deserve it, nor does Sony and their recent line of work of which everything wrong with shines here.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a kid from the 80s who remembers playing Pac-Man and Donkey Kong on a coin-up, I thought it was a fantastic concept for a movie, but it was put together so horribly.Adam Sandler gets to live out a fantasy of most gamers. In a similar plot to the Last Star Fighter, the main character Sam, after being nothing else but good at video games all his miserable life, somehow becomes the only man on Earth with the skill to defeat an alien invasion in the form of arcade classics (If the alien invasion was in the form of Sonic the Hedgehog, best believe I'm your guy).That sounds like a good idea, but let's face it, it's been a long time since Sandler's Joe Schmo routine has been that appealing. I'm sure he had fun on the set playing out a full scale level of Donkey Kong, but it was not fun to watch at all. I will say the best video game reenactment in the film was when they went up against Pac Man, that was cool, but all the other pixel battles just looked lame.Sandler's good at surrounding himself with friends he likes to work with, like the charming Kevin James who I loved as the U.S President and best friend to Sam. Peter Dinklage was also hilarious as Billy Mitchell another middle age man who reached his peak after becoming Donkey Kong champ.I think I feel most sorry for Chris Columbus, he's a pretty good director but he could not turn the short film this is based on (and I'm sure is far better) into something worth sitting through.The movie was good for a few chuckles and it was cool seeing some of my favorite old school game ions back in 8-bit form, but the movie falls to the rock bottom of being anything at all. Game over.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just got back from Pixels. What I can tell you is this: It's not good, but I didn't hate it like everyone else did. From what I've heard from every review I've read, they were pretty harsh on harsh on it.I'd say the positives are visual effects and when the video games are attacking. Everyone in their reviews have immaturely disregard the action sequences and the visual effects due to them being in an Adam Sandler movie. Plus there are cool cameos by a lot of 80's property.But the negatives are it's still an Adam Sandler movie with jokes that don't work and it doesn't know what it want to be. There are times where it's tries to have kid friend moment, but then it turns into a adult joke.I'd say your better off renting it at RedBox and skip to the action scenes.So yeah, it's a rental.It wasn't good, I wasn't mad like everyone else did.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic Arcade Video Gamers Should Enjoy It</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw "Pixels", starring Adam Sandler-Blended, The Longest Yard_2005; Kevin James-The Paul Blart movies, 50 First Dates; Michelle Monaghan- Mission:Impossible 3, Mr. &amp; Mrs. Smith; Josh Gad-The Wedding Ringer, The Rocker and Peter Dinklage-Game of Thrones_tv, X-Men:Days of Future Past.I like some of Adam Sandlers' movies and some, I don't. This one was pretty good. It starts in 1982 with Adam, Kevin, Josh &amp; Peter-portrayed as kids, of course-and they are doing what most kids did during that time period, play arcade video games. For those not old enough to know, back then you had stores-or arcades-that had lots of video games that you played by inserting a quarter in to a slot. Adam and Peter were in a championship arcade game contest and the video of their match is put into a time capsule-along with other stuff, too-and sent into space, in search of intelligent life on other planets. Switch to the present and it seems that the intelligent life that found the space capsule misunderstood the intentions of us fun loving earthlings and thought it was a declaration of war. They developed attacking squads made of energy that are based on the arcade games-such as Pacman, Donkey Kong, Centipede and Space Invaders-and they use videos of 1980's celebrities with their voices dubbed to convey their demands. One of the funniest ones is Hall &amp; Oates. Adam now works for an electronics store-think Best Buy-and he makes home installations or repairs. Kevin is now the President of the U.S.-think Chris Christie-but he is still friends with Adam. Josh still lives at home with his grandmother and believes in lots of conspiracy theories. Peter is in prison, fantasizing about a three way with Serena Williams &amp; Martha Stewart. When the aliens start attacking, guess who Kevin calls on? His old arcade gaming buddies because, who else would know how to fight giant centipedes? Michelle is in the military and helps develop the weapons Adam and company use. There are several cameos; I remember seeing Dan Aykroyd, Sean Bean, Brian Cox and Jane Krakowski. It's rated "PG-13" for language and video game violence and has a running time of 1 hour &amp; 45 minutes. I enjoyed it and would buy it on DVD.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pixels is directed by Chris Columbus and is painfully written by Tim Herlihy and Timothy Dowling. It stars Adam Sandler, Peter Dinklage, Josh Gad, Michelle Monaghan and Kevin James.When aliens intercept video feeds of classic arcade games and misinterpret them as a declaration of war, they attack Earth, using the games as models. Knowing that he must employ a similar strategy, President Will Cooper (Kevin James) recruits his childhood pal, former video-game champ and home-theater installer Sam Brenner (Adam Sandler), to lead a team of old-school arcade players (Peter Dinklage, Josh Gad) and a military specialist (Michelle Monaghan) to save the planet.No, just no. I usually start my reviews with the positives. Okay. The visuals looked crisp and virtual like the old arcade games. That's a major plus this movie has going for it. It also has some moderately funny performances from Gad and Dinklage. Done! Now this is the worst movie of the year. I don't like to give out F's it seems too harsh. This movie doesn't get one. I don't like to write reviews on movie that I didn't enjoy very much. This is the exception. I refused to write a review on Hot Pursuit and Soaked in Bleach because I didn't hate those movies. I hate this one!This movie has nothing funny or interesting to say. It spews out so much garbage that it's almost painful to watch. Adam Sandler kills. What? The role? NO! The movie. His performance is as wooden as Woody from Toy Story(great movie, I am in no way comparing the two) and much more bland. Kevin James' comedy is dry and stale. He's basically the clumsy guy who breaks a ton of stuff. Who thought that that would be entertaining or funny? The direction is fine but could've been better. I didn't expect much from the men that wrote This Means War and Grown Ups 2, at least they didn't disappoint.Overall this movie was bad and borderline unwatchable. If you want to see a movie this week watch Southpaw or Paper Towns, not this. Pixels gets a 3/10 or a D+ just because of Dinklage and Gad's performances and the visuals. Nothing else.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie was enjoyable on a fantasy stand point. I thought the movie would have been so much more awesome, but the fact that one of the characters fell in love with a video game character and she fell back in love with him with a few words was a cliché. That doesn't make too much sense since she is a digital program and should not be able to develop feelings. I feel that the movie gave me more of a fantasy of wishing video game characters did come to life, not to attack us but to definitely go against them for regular fun. I did dislike the fact that they didn't even include super Mario as an enemy or a boss to go against that would have maybe enjoy this movie a lot more. I also, didn't appreciate the fact that this movie totally made a punk out of Qbert and made him basically a damsel in distress. The best part of the movie was obviously the Pac Man part. The finale with Donkey Kong was good also, but in total the movie had some funny parts and could have used a better pulling story to actually have the crowd more into the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Adam Sandler and crew waste a potentially funny idea for Pixels that's not worth playing for</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Video games have come a long way since it's mainstream debut in the 1980s. Being born in 1987, I wasn't around long enough to see the classic arcade where games like Pac-Man, Q*bert, and Donkey Kong all created a new form of escapism for the youth. Most people weren't too sure what direction these games would go in. No one knew whether they would evolve into something bigger or if they were a fifteen-minute fad. When companies like Nintendo and Sega brought the games home, it was set that these games were here to stay. When Sony and Microsoft connected these games to the Internet, it seemed that the whole world was playing!In a way, most modern games have become like major motion pictures. I say this as a negative as while many games have long cut scenes that establish a full story, much of the action is with how well you can react and push a button rather then a true challenge. Exceptions include Minecraft and World of Warcraft as your poised to create a character and evolve him like most role-playing games or Modern Warfare and Mario Kart, which relies on playability between other players. A blast from the past puts the world on edge in the latest comedy, Pixels. In 1982, young Sam and Will go to a video game championship where Sam does well as a Pac-Man champion, but looses on Donkey Kong from the egocentric Eddie Plant. The event was recorded and placed in a time capsule that was sent into space, hoping that I would reach intelligent life.Cut to 2015 where Sam (played by Adam Sandler) is working as a home theater installer and Will (played by Kevin James) is now the president of the United States. Both seem board with their lives and hope for more.Aliens attack an army base in Guam that seem to turn everything they touch into pixelated forms. The White House examines the creatures to see that they resemble the characters from Galaga. It seems that the aliens misinterpreted the video games as a declaration of war and are attacking the Earth using those games. Will calls Sam to discuss how to defeat these aliens with his arcade skill. They get Eddie (played by Peter Dinklage) out of jail to join the team to fight They go to London to fight Centipede and New York to fight Pac-Man, yet these aliens seem bent on destroying the world.The idea of Pixels is a good one; a great one that could have been the blockbuster comedy that might have reached Ghostbusters levels. But the big problem starts right at the beginning; you see the Happy Madison Productions logo. This company seems to exist to only give comedian Adam Sandler as much work as possible while putting in as little effort for the comedy as possible. I was hoping that director Chris Columbus (Home Alone, Mrs. Doubtfire, Harry Potter) might spark Sandler into stepping up his comedy. IT DOESN'T!Adam Sandler not only plays the same obnoxious man-child he's been playing for the past ten years, but looks depressed through out the entirety of Pixels. Kevin James adds little to nothing, Peter Dinklage is insultingly wasted (though he gets a few laughs), and the rest of the cast serves to buffer Sandler. Story wise, the pixelated characters attack various cities, but I don't recall one person being hurt. With that, Pixels doesn't seem to care if the humans lived or died. Nothing is at stake and what's gained are women which I find sexist. Worst of all, this is a family movie that is speaking to a kid audience who have no idea who Pac-man or Q*bert are. Why even go after the children when they could have gotten an easy adult audience?I'll give this two "Game Over" screens out of ten. I'm declaring Game Over for Adam Sandler who doesn't seem to care about genuine comedy or the usage of a funny idea for a movie. This is a game that's not worth anyone's quarters!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Recycled Sandler humor with some action adventure in the mix</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"I believe that some alien life-force, has sent real life video games, to attack us."Chris Columbus, the man who directed the first two Harry Potter films as well as Home Alone, Mrs. Doubtfire, Adventures of Babysitting, and many more family friendly films that I actually enjoyed, now directs Adam Sandler in Pixels, a film that aims to appeal to those adults that grew up in the early 80's playing classic arcade games, but unfortunately it only ends up being entertaining for younger audiences due to its cliché jokes and formulaic structure. I must confess that I once was a huge Adam Sandler fan and watched everything he did from his Billy Madison days up to Jack and Jill in 2011 (with Chuck and Larry being the only exception, which somehow I miraculously missed). As a young teen I found his movies hilarious, but as I grew older his schtick got repetitive and I somehow decided to give up on him. I hadn't seen another film starring Sandler since Jack and Jill, but decided to give this one a try for nostalgic sake and because Columbus's films usually appealed to me despite his films being overly sentimental at times. It didn't hurt that Peter Dinklage was also starring in this film since I love what he does (his short scene in Elf is one of my favorites and he is awesome in Game of Thrones). All these factors managed to convince me to watch Pixels despite my low expectations and I honestly got what I was expecting. It's as if Adam Sandler directs all his comedies because they are so similar in tone despite never having directed, but I guess the directors always let him improvise and he ends up making the same jokes in every movie. The only positive feedback I'll give Pixels is that it did manage to engage with the younger audiences; my ten year old brother had a blast, so it might make some money at the box office. Based on Patrick Jean's own screenplay for a short film he made in 2010 (which seems far more appealing to me), this feature film opens in the 80's with a group of kids who grew up loving arcade games. Brenner (Anthony Ippolito) is so good at predicting these game patterns that he signs up to compete in an arcade national championship. His closest friend, Cooper (Jared Riley), is there cheering for him and he truly believes Brenner is destined for great things in life. During the tournament they also befriend a young boy named Ludlow (Jacob Shinder) who is obsessed with a cyber game character named Lady Lisa (Ashley Benson). Unfortunately, Brenner is defeated by Eddie (Andrew Bambridge), a loud mouthed arcade lover who goes by the nickname of fire blaster. The film then jumps to the present where we discover Brenner (Adam Sandler) hasn't really accomplished anything in life. He installs technical equipment for a company called Nerd. Cooper (Kevin James) however has become the President of the nation. Nerd sends Brenner to Violet's (Michelle Monaghan) home to install the latest gadgets for her young son Matty (Matt Lintz). Brenner and Violet have a small moment, but when he tries to lean in and kiss her things get ugly between them. Right after that awkward moment Brenner receives a call from Cooper about an alien attack on Earth (and so does Violet who is then revealed to be a Lieutenant). Apparently these aliens have attacked using the arcade game format created through pixels, and the only way to defeat them is similar to the way they played the game. Brenner enlists the help of Ludlow (Josh Gad) and his archenemy Eddie (Peter Dinklage) to try to defeat these alien invaders and save the Earth.As ridiculous or appealing as the premise sounds (depending on whether or not you're nostalgic over these classic arcade games) the greatest problem with Pixels is that its incredibly hard to believe some of the relationships between these characters. The first time Adam Sandler and Michelle Monaghan's characters meet, the dialogue between them is so phony and forced that it makes it impossible to relate to. That scene was probably one of the worst I've seen all year. Kevin James, Josh Gad, and Brian Cox can be funny people, but they play the same characters they've been playing in recent years. Dinklage's Fire Blaster seems to be either hit or miss for some people, and I actually found his character to be the funniest in the movie. No one here is actually trying hard and the film is proof of that, but audiences that are simply looking to escape for a couple of hours might find it amusing. I still don't know what Jane Krakowski was doing in this film since her character isn't given anything to do despite her comedic talents. She should've been used more. Pixels is recycled Sandler material that will only appeal to hardcore 80's nostalgic gamers and young kids who enjoy pretty much any adventure. http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was horrifying. A truly, god awful, cinematic release. Adam Sandler aside (though, yeah, he sucks in this too), the movie seems to take pride on this idea that the very demographic it's banking on seeing this movie, are a bunch of losers who live with their mothers, replaying games while covered in a cloud of Cheeto dust. Any sense of logical consistency (Which, yes, does matter even in a movie like this) is thrown out the window for arbitrary reasons. Are the aliens answering our call to war, via the video games we sent up with that probe? Or are they a confused, peaceful species? Is Q-bert a positive trophy for us? Or is he a traitor to their cause? The movie goes back and forth, and doesn't care because it's too busy trying to find some other ham fisted, bad joke about Pac man to make. Hell, the whole movie seems to just want to get you to give them money to be reminded that Centipede existed. Donkey Kong existed. If I tell you Galaga existed, can I get $24 million dollars in a weekend too? AND DON'T EVEN GET ME STARTED ON THE FACT THEY MADE A FEMALE CHARACTER INTO A LITERAL TROPHY, BECAUSE EVERYTHING IS TERRIBLE.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Please don't feed the ego or family of Adam Sandler. Look, I genuinely like Sandler. I am a fan of many of his movies, but this one is not a good movie. He plays a video game nerd that had a chance of making it big as a child, only to come in second place, and thus be regulated to a life of drudgery. Having your best friend become president and still want to hang out with you doesn't seem to qualify as "cool" or "awesome." Just tedious. Now, as an adult, he works as a NERD, a computer guy based on the Geek squad, and installs electronics in homes (when not hanging with the leader of the free world). Aliens attack our planet, using our old video games as the basis of their attacks, and it is up to Sandler, Dinklage, and Lamansoff, all three contenders from a video game competition from 30 years ago, to save the world. There are so many problems with this movie. It's clunky. It's stupid. It can only appeal to small children, and even they must have had some traumatic brain injury to be able to enjoy this movie. Given the premise, of video game superstars fending off video game monsters, you have to know that children are going to be attending in droves. Make it kid friendly. This movie doesn't try to cater to them--a question of what to call a male maggot was answered with, "Mangina?" a cross between maggot and vagina. Funny? No. Not at all. Did the children laugh? They didn't understand. Now...am I supposed to explain to my 8 year old what a "mangina" is? The rest of the cast just phoned in their parts. I paid 17 dollars for popcorn and soda, and the the tickets were free. I could have stayed at home and watched it for free in a couple of months, and would have saved 17 bucks. Please, don't make the same mistake I did.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>NASA sends a message containing video games, footage from old T.V. shows, and interviews from celebrities like Madonna into space, to communicate with intelligent life forms, who misinterpret them as a declaration of war. The aliens thereafter attack Earth as pixelized versions of characters from popular 80's arcade games.Adam Sandler along with Kevin James, Josh Gad and Peter Dinklage star in the sci-fi comedy Pixels, portraying former arcade game champs, called upon to save the planet from the attacking video game characters of the 80's. The film utilizes nostalgia and video games to its advantage to develop an emotional connection with the audience wholived during that era, as well as connecting with the current generation.The comic timing from Adam Sandler, Kevin James and Josh Gad were spot on. The actors were right in their comfort zone and honestly attempting exactly what was expected of them. Peter Dinklage was also good but there were times where his loud egoistic character was just plain annoying. Michelle Monaghan rounds up the loud ensemble group playing the strong single mother and White House military adviser. The special effects were wonderful and the video game characters with their vibrant colors looked fantastic. The gamer within was particularly overjoyed to see characters from popular games like Pac-Man, Donkey Kong and Centipede. Other lesser known games like Tetris and Asteroids are also portrayed and will take audience members back to the memorable time they spent playing arcade games. A blink and miss shot of Toru Iwatani (creator of Pac- Man) during the opening sequence, will have fanatics ecstatic. Later in the movie a lovely tribute is bestowed upon Iwatani, thanking him for giving the world one of the most popular games of all time.Pixels overall is a fun ride if you just sit back and try not to analyze the film for what it really is ? light-hearted entertainment that does not go over the top. It may seem nonsensical, but it is enjoyable and a cool blast from the past.</fullReview>

Bad puns, stupid sometimes incorrect references. One of Ben Stillers (and that says a lot) worst movies as an actor. The plot is terrible, the ending is predictable and poor.

Not being an arcade gamer didn't leave much lost in translation. The 1982 Arcade Games Championship was filmed and for some reason later became part of a payload shot into space. Decades later the video clips are intercepted and misunderstood to be a declaration of war. The same competing gamer geeks and nerds of long ago are called on to protect the earth from invading aliens conducting war in the form of ancient arcade games.Special effects are more interesting than most of the stars directed by Chris Columbus: Adam Sandler, Kevin James, Peter Dinklage, Brian Cox and Dan Aykroyd.

It's a tragedy of a movie. Well, that's Sandler mostly. Actually, I liked the Cobbler but this was one Sandler's usual flicks. The characters actually give up, yet still somehow win through cheats. That's fine except that hmm... I don't know. Cheats don't work in real life. You can't hack real life. There's the usual stereotypes in this movie like the undeveloped hot chick and the one dimensional bully. I DON'T KNOW about YOU but PLEASE DON'T watch it if you hate bad films. BTW a lot of people are payed to give good reviews. I was offered money to give a good review, but I didn't accept it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Probably the worst film of the year.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is not an exaggeration this film is complete garbage. Sandler and James have this reverse king Midas effect where everything they act in seems to be absolutely terrible and Pixels follow suit. This movie is completely unfunny and every character is completely annoying. Sandler sticks to his trialled and failed form of comedy where he always has to explain his jokes and leaves nothing to the viewers imagination. Kevin James playing Kevin James as the president is completely ridiculous and unlikable( like every other role of his), however both these characters aren't the most annoying that the film has to offer. That goes to Josh Gad, he's is constantly shouting in this dreadful, high pitched voice. Monaghan is there to be another beautiful women who Sandler gets with. Peter Dinklage's character is probably the funniest character in the film, thats not too hard, and has a total of two funny things to say.I feel this film could have been a lot better as a homage to retro games but instead falls flat. If there's one simple reason not to watch this film is that Kevin James is president, enough said.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Attention !! This review is as choppy as Adam Sandler's acting.The pixel villains look stupid and unreal. I've seen much better work in hand drawn cartoons. Really.The story could win the Nobel prize for the most unimaginative writing about imaginative characters.Great idea, horrible casting. Don't pay to see this, or have someone else pay for it. Someone you don't really like.While watching the movie you start remembering some stuff from the 80's and start forgetting this terrible film altogether.I'd rather tape my face to a Donkey Kong arcade for 3 weeks than watching this movie twice.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pixels</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At least, I can say this: the main problem of Pixels isn't Adam Sandler. It seems impossible, but this time, Sandler's "comic" routines feel almost subtle... at least comparing them with all the irritating "performances" he brought in the past. It's like he's maturing. I'm not saying he's very funny in here, or that he has redeemed himself for the many years he tortured audiences from all around the world, but I didn't find him hateful, and he didn't inspire me wishes to leave the cinema. The horrible screenplay of Pixels dealt with that. This movie is based on a 2-minute short film made in 2010. On a short format, it's quite an amusing idea: the enemies of '80s video games threaten humanity with an excellent combination of 2D aesthetic and 3D technology, and the result is an attractive "retro" style which doesn't feel out of place in the "real" world. Unfortunately, co- screenwriters Tim Herlihy and Timothy Dowling were unable to extend the concept to a full- length film, and they couldn't tell an interesting or entertaining (let's not say logical anymore) story. I know, I know... Who is seeking for logic in a film in which Pac-man and Donkey Kong attack Washington and New York? I guess that's the excuse taken by Herlihy and Dowling to write a shamefully stupid screenplay, which doesn't work as a comedy, as science fiction, and even less, as a childish adventure. Thinking about it well, I don't know what target audience this film was made for. There are absolutely childish moments, like the Q*bert which becomes a pet/comic relief of the heroes. At the same time, there are humor attempts which are a bit more "juvenile" (like the character who wants to make a sexual "sandwich" with two female celebrities). And there's also a wide dose of '80s nostalgia. And I think that that's the main problem of Pixels: not having defined its specific purpose. Or maybe I lost contact with the "zeitgeist", and the kids from nowadays truly appreciate the archaic references to Ronald Reagan, Hall &amp; Oates and Fantasy Island. As I previously said, I unexpectedly didn't hate Sandler's performance, and as for the rest of the cast, they do whatever they can with their roles. I particularly felt pity for Peter Dinklage (imitating Billy Mitchell, the video games champion portrayed in the brilliant documentary The King of Kong) and Michelle Monaghan, who has the "romantic interest" function; both are excellent actors who deserve much better material than this, but well... I guess they have to pay the rent sometimes. I don't know whether it was possible to make a good science fiction comedy based only on the visual gag of the 8- bit characters co-existing in the real world; but I'm sure that Herlihy and Dowling didn't make attempt it in the least, and the result is an insipid and tremendously boring film which is an absolute waste of time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This film makes me hate the movie industry</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie feels as though Sandler walked on set straight from his trailer, read his lines off a cue-card, then went back to sleep. At every turn, his indifference to the material is palpable. If I could give negative stars to this 106-minute insult to gaming, I would. It's sexist, boring, lazy, bafflingly inconsistent, and just plain badly written. Spend the time you would have been watching this movie instead walking barefoot over LEGOs, and you will have fewer regrets.Adam Sandler is a money hog and his movies are as funny as the holocaust. If I had to choose between getting waterboarded and watching an Adam Sandler movie, I would be waterboarded while bamboo sticks inside my fingernails. Overall not a good movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty awful movie with pretty CGI</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>l came into watching this movie hearing from others that this was another bad Adam Sandler movie, others saying it was a great movie and thoroughly enjoyed it and that they grew up with video games seen in the movie. First off l would like to say that nostalgia &#x2260; good movie. And l must say, Adam Sandler was just being Adam Sandler, however he was not the only factor of the movie that made this absolutely awful, it was also the absolute crap writing, the stupid premises, the lazy sequences, just everything you could name in a bad movie, here it is. The only reason l am giving this film a 2 star, is because 1 star is the lowest you can go, and 1 extra star for the CGI. The CGI and compositing in this movie is spot on, and it looks great, that at least l can appreciate. The movie starts out to introduce the premise of the story and our protagonist, and than hard cuts you into the 'current time' where our world starts suddenly being attacked by various classic video games. Each of those video game sequences are done so well in CGI, but resolved so HORRIBLY lazy. lt's hard to explain, but basically l had to force myself to finish this film, l couldn't stand watching it and l wanted it to be over so badly, and even the end wasn't satisfying for the viewers. The credits were cute, but that still plays more on CG. Don't waste your time unless you want cheap (AND I MEAN EXTREMELY CHEAP) laughs and want to stare at some cool CGI. Most of other people that will say this was a good movie, are blinded by nostalgia and CGI. What lies beneath is an extremely lazily written piece of garbage movie script that has wasted a genuinely good movie concept. (and no, the rating has nothing to do with Sandler, l came into watching this movie with low expectations)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you are into pretty colors and not having a brain this may be for you. If you have any amount of appreciation for your hard earned money you will skip this pile of garbage. Adam Swindler and his crew have figured out that the general American audience will stare at a wall for the sake of staring at a wall. That's what this movie makes you feel like you are doing, just staring at a big empty wall and you are paying to do so. Don't be fooled by these big budget productions of nothing but fart and pee jokes. Be better than this people. Boycott this type of garbage and keep Sandler out of the theater. Chris Columbus is such a great director and his talent was wasted here.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This... film ... sucks. The animation is lifeless, the jokes are in no way funny at all, the pooh-pooh innuendos are just terrible, the script is so awful that I'd rather read Twilight, and last and certainly least, the Nazi and racist remarks in this film just makes me sick, who's idea was it to do all this crap? If Roger Ebert were alive, not only would he give his trademarked thumbs down, but he'd give this film a middle finger and that will have to be trademarked. If anyone buys this, take the movie, put it in the microwave, turn it on, watch it spark to death, take it out, get a shovel, dig a hole, throw the movie in there, and bury it and send it back to the fires of the underworld. Although Steven King might have given it a decent score if they slipped him a small fee while nobody was looking; after all, he did recommend The Hunger Games.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pixels is packed with vibrant visuals and nostalgic charm that offsets slouchy Sandler and his awkward humor.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nostalgia is a powerful emotion but also the only word that can entirely describe Pixels - a sci-fi adventure masquerading as a comedy. While this film has every reason to fail as a comedy, it can still appeal to a specific audience - kids of the 80s, and the current generation of pre-teens yet to discover the trappings of social media.That's a generation gap of 30 years, but the defining moment that bridges this gap is the mutual love for video games. Back in the day, the social norm was to get out of the house, walk to the arcade, spend a few hours with real friends, and vie for social standing as a champion gamer. It felt real with moments that bring back joyous memories that not even a thousand friends on Facebook can match today. On the flip side, gamers are still typecast as nerds, and this is what the film attempts to say. It's 1982 and gaming prodigy Sam has a shot at the Guinness Book championship title. Backed by his gaming chums Will and Ludlow, Sam reaches the finals in a faceoff against narcissist nemesis Eddie 'The Fire Blaster'. Also present is NASA who records the competition and sends it into space to contact alien life. Wrong move. Cut to present day and Will (Kevin James) is the President of the USA (there's hope for gamers?) while Sam (Adam Sandler) and Ludlow (Josh Gad) are everyday losers. Turns out, those aliens did get the message but misinterpreted it as a hostile invitation. Who do you call? Ghostbusters zapping aliens pretty much sums up the rest of the film. While the story gets dumber by the minute (inclusive of the clichéd romance between Sandler's Mr. Fixit and Michelle Monaghan's White House official), director Chris Columbus alternates flat gags with solid visuals and iconic characters that wreak havoc on screen. Add to that some madcap moments from Peter Dinklage as the aforementioned narcissist, Gad let loose ala Jonah Hill style from the Jump Street films, and a list of clever cameos, and there's enough reason for Pixels to generate some offbeat excitement.The fact that Sandler is still pigeonholed as a sad-sack from his Happy Madison Productions (from Happy Gilmore to last year's The Cobbler) can be a typical letdown for many viewers and fans alike. It's the same reason why most of the amusement comes from the supporting cast. Even as they deliver with acceptable comic timing, the real fun is in racing back to the days of Atari or annihilating monsters at the gaming arcade. And speaking of nostalgia, look no further than Columbus, the writing genius behind all time classics like The Goonies and Gremlins - films that are as iconic as the Pac-Man and Donkey Kong games. Kids who watched those films or played those games are grownups today but for the most part, Pixels made me feel as invincible as a kid in an arcade. Game on dude!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Awesomely fun movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The premise of this movie is sure to please anyone who was alive in the 80s with a love of games, nostalgia, and even 80s cameo appearances. It's a fairly clean movie too with some nice surprises. I haven't laughed so hard in a long time as when Ludlow tries to give a pep talk to soldiers. A refreshing point is also that we aren't treated with the typical feminazi nonsense you would expect to see in an exchange between male and female lead characters. To see a male fire some stinging one-liners right back at a woman, sniping both the class divide and hypergamy as well, is not the trend Hollywood usually pushes. It was a nice change. There is also a tiny jab at Obama near the end of the movie, you have to listen to catch it, as some of the political jokes will fly over peoples heads. The nerd jokes will also fly over peoples heads who are not familiar with the culture. It is definitely a good time movie, ignore the politically correct out-of-touch haters. If you are easily offended at Sandler-esque insults, slight crude humor, or if you are expecting a 'serious' movie, this is not for you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pixels Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Was at the premiere Saturday 7/18. I am an Sanders, James, Dinklage, Gadd and Monaghan fan. Being a child of the 80's didn't hurt either. Historically accurate spin on the entertainment of gaming in the 80's, which then translates into the invasion of earth. I thought the writing was done for Sandler, James and Gadd. The comedy element was purely for them. Monaghan can adapt to any role and is truly an under appreciated talent, she rocks it here. If you love 80's music, you will love the music in this movie! Nice to see Dinklage in something other than Game of Thrones. He is a gifted actor. This will be the Family Movie of the summer! You will laugh and rock-n-roll in your seat!</fullReview>
