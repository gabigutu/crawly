		<shortDescription>This was a refreshing return to horror/thriller for me</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I only gave it a 9 because I don't believe in perfect scores... There's so much that I love about this movie! and I think the thing that helped is that I knew nothing about it going into it. In these days trailers will often spoil things and change your expectations going into it. If the trailer is cut properly it will really raise your expectations and you could be in for a disappointment.. in my situation I never saw a trailer and only knew the title.Suffice to say I was VERY engaged in the movie because I had no idea what to expect.. there were many amazing elements, I've always loved the implementation of dreams into horror movies because I myself have nightmares often.. it resonates with me.. this movie pulls that off so perfectly in my mind. I also love the amazing performance the kid who plays Cody gave.I encourage you to give this one a chance, and try to avoid ANY kind of spoilers you can avoid.. don't watch the trailer, just check it out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Creative movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie isn't a typical and predictable "happy ending movie", however it has many twist plots and is amazingly creative. I loved the idea at the end and how the ending was a bit open, making the audience think a bit for themselves. Frankly speaking, this story throws a bomb at the end as you struggle throughout the whole movie of sudden terrifying scenes, it's all worth it. Jacob Tremblay is an amazingly talented kid and his acting skills slay in this movie, especially in certain scenes. However, I think in some specific scenes, Kate Bosworth's character and her "husband", lacked showing emotions. I feel that if a bit more emotions were portrayed from the characters, it would've been much more powerful. Overall, great movie, worth the watch! :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good film, that is more fantasy than horror.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before I Wake tells the story of Cody(Jacob Tremblay). Cody has been moving from place to place because, different foster parents have been adopting him from time to time. Now, he is in the care of, Jessie(Kate Bosworth) &amp; Mark(Thomas Jane). Jessie &amp; Mark soon realize, that Cody's dreams physically appear before them, as he sleeps. The deadly fact is, the same thing happens during his nightmares. Before I Wake is an impressive film. However, it is not that scary. The jump scares are minimal. The suspense is superbly maintained throughout the movie, by director Mike Flanagan. However, the ending of the film, is disappointing &amp; frankly, slightly silly. The biggest flaw with this movie is that it is not properly categorized. It is supposed to be a horror movie but, it feels more like a fantasy thriller. The script by Mike Flanagan &amp; Jeff Howard is original &amp; unique. However, I liked Flanagan &amp; Howard's previous collaboration, Oculus(2013) better. Jacob Tremblay's performance as Cody, is the highlight of the film. Tremblay continues to impress us with his supreme acting ability, after being lauded for his performance in Room(2015). Kate Bosworth is great as Jessie. Thomas Jane is effective as Mark. Annabeth Gish is good as Natalie. Dash Mihok is awesome as Whelan. Antonio Evan Romero, Kyla Deaver &amp; Hunter Wenzel are amazing as Sean, Annie &amp; Tate, respectively. Before I Wake is not a must watch. Still, it is worth a watch if you have some time to spare.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>scary and sentimental</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Imaginative and sad, the movie pulls you in with compassion for the parental figures and the child in the movie. (Which is sometimes underachieved in this genre). Though there are some points of child horror in the movie, I can happily say that for the most part it steers clear of making the child the focal point of fear, we all know how kids are basically living spawn of Satan in horror films. And if you're like me, it's a very tiring trope. Cody's dreams are beautiful but turn very dark very quickly, the amount of stress the boy feels is understandable and makes him an extremely sympathetic character for the audience. This is one of the first horror films that has successfully made me fear for the safety of a child (Cody) during the story. The movie plays on the loss the parents feel for their first child and the temptation to use Cody as a way to be with him again. This causes tension between the parents and leads to an interesting conflict between the two. Though I feel the conflict was not focused on enough before continuing with the story.I feel that the fantasy horror element for the movie is a fine approach. It reminds me a great deal of Guillero del Toro's films. (Think Pan's Labyrinth but with no blood and a few jump scares.) I feel that if you enjoy Guillero del Toro's films, this movie will be an enjoyable experience for you as it beautifully combines fantasy with horror and builds up to a bittersweet ending that leaves you with a bit of an inspired feeling about where the characters may go from where the story leaves off.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Absolutely a fantastic fantasy/horror film !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just saw it at the cinema and I really loved it. It's an amazingly beautiful horror film! Something type like "A Nightmare on Elm Street", "The Amityville Horror", "Mama" and "The Possession"..The story was really interesting! The kid Cody (Jacob Tremblay) has unusual nightmares, but he can't live without nightmares until he finds one thing to realize something..The acting were good, but Jacob Tremblay (the kid who played in "Room") was absolutely a fantastic and very cute kid in it.Don't expect a scary movie that is actually scary, but it has some scary parts and good jump scares. The special makeup is amazing! The ending was beautiful and just sad, but also happy! I gave "Before I Wake" a 9.5 out of 10. I recommend this movie if you want to watch it, it will give you an enjoyable time!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Refreshing and Thoughtful... Makes You Jump But Makes You Think</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The biggest strength of Before I Wake is in my opinion the writing. I was impressed with the story and background of characters from the beginning. Horror films these days, with the exception of a few, don't seem to have plot development beyond a vague explanation. But I appreciate a horror movie that has a strong story element. Flashbacks were used throughout to show reasons behind certain character actions. The story itself is something you'd think is from Stephen King. So if you like that kind of thing this movie is for you. A foster child has the power to make dreams (and nightmares) real. His new foster parents are unsure what's happening when their home starts to become a wonderland of dream creatures..including monsters. The fantasy element colors the movie a much different shade than something like the Conjuring. As it develops, the mysterious circumstances keep you guessing which is fun if you're watching with someone. My girlfriend and I were both trying to figure it out before things were revealed. By the end I was left wanting more and while that may bother some moviegoers, at least it leaves room for a sequel. See this movie if you can and keep an open mind!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Do not expect a "regular" horror movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie somewhat reminded me of "A.I. Artificial Intelligence", a movie that started out like a drama and in the end felt like a fairy tale story. "Before I Wake" has the feel of a horror movie at times, but turns into, albeit a scary one, a fairy tale. The good: The actors did a fine job, especially the two leads. A well written story and the fantasy effects looks good. The bad: The monster did not look very scary, but I guess there is a reason for that in the story. The movie is promoted as a horror, I guess that will leave some viewers disappointed. This is not The Conjuring or Saw. This is a fantasy with some scary elements.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Horror. An odd mix of genres.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a film about death--its meaning and how we cope with it. I'm not sure for me that the mix of genres worked. I was mildly disturbed by the horror, occasionally caught up in the wonder, and yet ultimately put off by the cloying sentimentality. It is quite a good movie in many ways: it's superbly acted, and some of the scenes are very original. I just don't think the blend worked for me. For once there was an American child actor who wasn't intensely irritating. He was rather sweet and I wanted him and his little butterfly book to survive. I guess a movie can't be all bad when it makes an impression. I won't ever see Christmas tree baubles in quite the same light again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's fairly standard, but it's a horror movie that the whole family can watch.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a horror movie that just about anyone can sit through without it giving them nightmares. So if you wants a very scary and suspenseful scary movie than this movie is probably not for you. When it comes to the story, it's pretty standard. About a haunted boy or girl's past and supernatural stuff going on. Again this isn't a scary horror movie, this one seemed more like a fantasy movie with creepy ghosts. It sort of reminded me of the movie "The Lovely Bones" mixed with "MAMA" except with a lower budget . Where it leads to it having more heart and touching moments with supernatural elements thrown in. If you have seen horror movies before, there really isn't anything new when it comes to this. I personally found it boring since I have seen everything in this movie done before, except scarier. But if you are looking for a horror movie that the whole family can probably watch without it going overboard with blood and gore, this one might be it.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Decent movie, it has a couple flaws in the script (which I can't really point out without spoiling stuff so I won't bother doing that) but the resolution was brilliant and Kate Bosworth pulled one of her better performances as of late so it's well worth seeing.If you are looking for a horror movie to have you by the edge of the seat the whole time, this is probably the wrong movie to pick but if you want to see something original (as far as horror's goes at least) then this is not that bad of a pick.So yeah a solid effort with an emotional punch and it also looks very neat visually.If you liked HALF LIGHT (2006) with Demi Moore and DRAGON FLY (2002) with Kevin Costner then I think this should be right up your alley.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay here we go... I am so sick of all the people writing reviews where they pick apart the Genre classification, like that some how makes the content of the movie bad because of their "say-so". Get a damn life and quit being a anal retentive Armchair sycophant. Couldn't you just say they got the sub categories wrong and be done with it. No one really gives a crap. If you think it really matters, Then write to the Studio that produced the film and complain to them. (guaranteed your letter will wind up in the round file") Instead, write a fair review about the actual "Movie" and move on. NOW... I liked this movie, it was done well, great acting ( the kid stole the show in my opinion). Filming was great, suspense slow and grinding, Music was good and the special effects were actual good for this type of movie. It reminded me of the 1984 movie Dreamscape with Dennis Quaid and David Patrick Kelly where he helps the kid with the same kind of problem. Done well and It was great entertainment. Enjoy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Twilight Zone Ripoff</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can't help but feel this is a ripoff (artistic license?) of the Twilight Zone: The Movie segment, "It's a wonderful life" where the little boy whose mind can create anything is rescued by the woman traveling cross country, becoming his surrogate mother.. same premise, slightly different take. If the director didn't see the original and write this movie from that, I'll eat my shoes. I got the conceptual vibe from the very beginning. Not horror, really, more a fantasy movie. Put it this way, my girlfriend cried at the end; I was just glad it was over. Don't consider this a spoiler, but this movie is very formulaic, I knew what was going to happen next throughout the film, right up to the ending..</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What I've Come to Expect of Flanagan</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on my thoughts on Occulus and Hush, I've come to expect a great plot and questionable execution from Flanagan's productions and he did not disappoint in this. The heavy reliance on butterflies and a woman coming to appreciate and love a child that's not her own (among other things) reminded me of a better horror movie; Mama. All this did was make me wish I was watching that instead of Before I Wake. But then again, Before I Wake isn't a horror movie and it shouldn't have been marketed as one. The film is one part fantasy, one part drama and one part horror/thriller (whatever you want to call it) but it has a difficult time balancing this out. The script and screenplay is too half-baked to advance the film to the heights it wanted to reach.While the characters are not totally flat, it's hard to grasp their motivations exactly. The mother (Kate Bosworth) seems to be driven more by a sense of obligation to her son and later as some sort of moral obligation to herself and her husband instead of an emotional drive toward her adopted son. (This is something which was smoothed over in the last scene of the movie though.) Throughout the film, I had no idea how it was going to end. I was confused about where the film would go but unfortunately, so were the filmmakers. Not being able to develop a screenplay which could support the aspirations of the movie as a drama/thriller/horror/fantasy film, the ending was vague and the movie itself was full of ineffective jump scares and loud noises. Cody's affliction never manifests beyond the typical horror genre clichés that Flanagan relies so heavily upon. Despite this, the story is undoubtedly interesting and would have fared well as a stand alone fantasy film in the hands of the right director/ writer. The dream sequences are often beautiful, the closing act has a bittersweet melancholic note to it and Before I Wake does have moments that inspire some emotion in the heart of the watcher. But so many things are skimmed over and left unexplained, even in the real world the movie tries to depict (how can one bring hidden confidential files home or break into a foster home) While it is not totally incompetently directed, it is a messy film which can't find focus. Before I Wake is entertaining enough and fairly enjoyable, but one can't deny that it is filled with clichés and certain sequences which often become flat out boring or worse, laughable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Flanagan's aiming at PG13</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After seeing Absentia, i had high hopes for Flanagan's work. Then, i saw Oculus, mainstream horror attempt, which was average.Now i thing the director is aiming at mass entertainment movies, which isn't always bad. But it's not the case here since Before I Wake is full of predictable moments and Hollywood clichés.First of all, the characters, secondly the jump scares and CGI.The characters are a bit two dimensional, not fully developed, the acting is average though. It fails at being a good grief and loss drama and it kinda fails at being a fantasy horror movie.The jump scares are nothing that we haven't seen before in tons of mainstream productions. Build up is not always effective and the script not always coherent.Mild spoiler: Same recipe used: child has a gift, something went bad, the woman investigates the past and brings closure.It's not all bad, cinematography and acting are good from time to time, hence the vote, a 6-7 out of 10. And also i think the child did his part very good, a very talented kid. I've seen him in ROOM (2015) which was a great movie...Let's hope Flanagan's HUSH is be better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quite good!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before I Wake is not really a horror film. It is labeled as supernatural thriller and I can agree with that, but also it can be labeled as supernatural fairytale as - from what I understood - the film has a very happy ending.Must say that the kid who was playing Cody is great. He is really believable and his expressions throughout the film were really convincing ( either in school or in bed/home). His parents also did a great job.The story itself is interesting and keeps you guessing. The revealing truth at the end of the film is good as it gives totally different look on the kid's dreams/nightmares. If we did believe he is responsible for the ( unknown) death of his mother, now we see it isn't so.The only fault with the film for me is how suddenly and at once the ( new) mother is getting into the rescue of Cody and how she is not afraid ( how come?) of nightmares get to her because she has figured out the cause of all. Seems she overnight or less got into the story and everything - medical records, the diary, Cody's previous parents and so on... All in all, quite a good film. Not boring for a moment. Eight from me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film based on flawed humans makes for a much better viewing than actual slash/gore</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was surprised to see a trailer of 'Before I wake' on YouTube so late in the year. Weird to see a movie releasing so late in the US when it was released in India a few months back and even made it to flights - yeah I saw it on one of my long journeys as I couldn't go to the theater in time. I dug around a bit and turns out that the production company went bust; it was actually supposed to hit screens as early as mid of last year. So they kept pushing the dates and when they got some money, they released the film in a few countries. I guess they were smart, knowing that the movie wouldn't really be able to make much money. So I am surprised to see now they are releasing in the US.Even though I saw it in a flight, I can tell you that it was pretty clear to watch and sounded good, so all you purists, don't go judging me :) and take my word when I say that even if you saw it in a theater, your experience would be the same. Now I really like Kate Bosworth and Jacob Tremblay, they are great actors and they do a great job in this movie as well but the story just isn't there.It is a supernatural thriller about this child whose dreams and nightmares become real, physically alive. He has been through a few foster homes and there are a lot of dead and missing people, all because of his nightmares, one of which is Canker-man, an alien/deformed monster who eats people. When he makes it into Jessie and Mark's home, he fills them with hope as they see a beautiful butterfly on the first night he is there. They lost their son when he accidentally drowned in the tub and they have been grieving since then. They love each other but the strains in the relationship are beginning to show and with Cody's introduction into their lives, they look for a new beginning. But alas, that is not to be. Cody's moods start to change and his beautiful dreams become nightmares that take on an ugly turn. The climax is not what I expected but without giving away too much, I think that could be the only ending.I have seen Mike Flanagan's Oculus, which is one of my top recent horror movies and I have heard he did a good job with Hush as well but Before I Wake fails in the story department. Where it succeeds is the acting and the visuals. I think the visuals were really good, even when you see it on a small screen. Tremblay gives another solid performance and the true horror of possessing such a gift/curse was emoted really well by him. I still think it is a one time watch because of all the rubbish movies out there; this one is based on flawed human beings and that makes for a much better watch compared to slash/gore teen flicks. But make sure to watch Room after just to reinforce how good Jacob Tremblay is for a 10 year old actor.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Somewhat original and quite enjoyable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I liked it. It was a little bit creepy, a little bit fantastic and a little bit lump in the throat(y).You can kind of guess how it will resolve and what the different dream elements are before the story get's there but it still managed to be engrossing and feel fresh along the way.As other reviews mention, the story is about how the mind deals with loss via death. The seemingly odd combination elements in the film do fit together when you consider the perspective they are revealed to represent at the end.The kid in the film is pretty cute and manages to make you feel protective of and sympathetic towards him without saying that much, which is an achievement in itself. The effects are OK - sometimes they look really good and sometimes a bit quirky but that kind of makes sense by the end also.All in all, quite enjoyable if you are in the mood for slightly scary film with a warm heart.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a very "nice" suspense/horror movie - with a satisfyingly good ending that explains and ties things together neatly. As with most horror movies - i went in without too great an expectation and was pleasantly surprised that i really liked it.This movie may be a little bit too soppy or "nice" to be classified a real horror movie.It does not rely much on jump scares. Actually it uses scares only sparsely - and instead goes with story and mystery. The roles of the foster parents are actually nicely done and acted. They are a lot less clichéd than countless other "typical foster parents in suspense/horror movies".Special effects were alright but not too great - i would have loved to see more practical effects, because the CGI kind of made it look like a rather cheap computer cut-scene sometimes.All in all - recommended - but not if you are looking for a real scare. Personally i d rather classify that movie as a fantasy story with scare elements.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More like a dark fantasy movie for young teens with a few elements of horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie didn't really do it for me, at least in terms of horror. It had great potential and some creepy elements, but all in all I found it to be a bit too rushed, linear and the expected plot twist not intriguing enough to save the story.The characters never really developed, and in the end I didn't really care for any of them. The body of the movie was the idea of "dreams that inflict on reality", which is a pretty cool thought in itself, but there are already other movies (Nightmare on Elm street, Insidious for example) that had a far better and scarier interpretation on that idea. I felt like the concept art had a childish style, and a lot of the horror elements in the movie became not as frightening because of that. I do realise that the childish style probably is intentional, but if you want to see a true horror movie with good dramaturgy and manuscript, I wouldn't recommend this one.</fullReview>

Not here. Before I Wake wraps up its little story very nicely.The reveal of the big bad's origins was touching. Well done, thumbs up.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Human Heart to Go with the Scares</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is infinitely better to center horror films around flawed, adult human beings, rather than seeing another vapid pretty face slashed by a faceless mook. Filmmakers like Guillermo del Toro (The Devil's Backbone) and William Friedkin (The Exorcist) understood that notion, where human flaws and regrets coil up subconscious fears into horrifying supernatural manifestations. Greenhorn filmmaker Mike Flanagan, who scared audiences with his surprisingly clever Oculus years ago, returns to follow these veterans' footsteps with his flawed but nonetheless human sophomore effort.Here, Flanagan whips up another spooky tale that effectively doubles as a drama about loss and coping, centering around troubled adult couple Jessie (Kate Bosworth) and Mark (Thomas Jane) coping with the loss of their child Sean. They adopt gifted kid Cody (Jacob Tremblay) whose dreams - and nightmares - come physically alive. Jessie sees this as an opportunity to relive her memories of her dead child, while Mark becomes rightfully concerned. Bosworth and Jane play their roles straight without the slightest hint of genre awareness, instantly grounding the film in tragic plausibility throughout.Despite some shortcomings - including a half-baked coda that feels like a blatant Nikon ad, Flanagan's clever and wisely understated direction - including a refreshing lack of jumpy moments and music in the favor of slow burn chills - overcomes them and brings out the best in atmosphere and performances ? specifically that of young Jacob Tremblay, who subverts the evil kid trope by convincingly looking remorseful about his 'gifts', unfortunately to little avail.</fullReview>

She carried the movie well as this paranoid mother. Thomas Jane was also great as my favorite character from the movie. The theater we watched in was completely empty so we yelled out lots of crap and the movie turned out to be an enjoyable time for us. THe story was interesting.

The story line is fair, but then came the butterflies who looks more than fireflies than anything else, the weak direction and that little boy who looks like a girl, I hate this little effeminate kids with long hair, big eyes and a lot of LIP GLOSS. Is really disgusting, not mention the visual effects remind me the movie "Boogiemen", and where all the "Canker men " victims go? Well the worst part of this attempt to film was the AWFUL END, that it looks exactly like a Coca-Cola commercial. That's it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>horror not scary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jessie (Kate Bosworth) and Mark Hobson (Thomas Jane) are recovering from the death of their son. They adopt Cody (Jacob Tremblay) who is obsessed with butterflies. Natalie (Annabeth Gish) is his case worker. Strange things happen and it's soon discovered that Cody's nightmare can become deadly real.Mike Flanagan delivers a well-shot film. As a horror, it's not scary. Jacob Tremblay has a charisma about him. Kate Bosworth is fine. I don't think butterflies are scary and the nightmares are not nightmarish enough. There is nice reveal of the origins of his nightmares and there is a poetry to the story. Although it's just not scary.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mix of Horror &amp; Fantasy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the director of Oculus - a creepy and nerve cracking horror movie, Mike Flanagan decided to become creative and it resulted in Before I Wake. More of a fantasy than a horror, the movie had its few jump scares, but with no strong storyline and mediocre acting, it disappointed where it could have been a good film. Before I Wake has its moments, but it never quite gels into something coherent or greater than the sum of its disparate parts. Rrgardless of the disappointing result, Mike Flanagan should be credited for making a new style of horror gimmick though it didn't match to his grade. I would go with 2.5/5 for 'Before I Wake'.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Taking The Meaning of Horror Further</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have found many films in this genre to love, all because that which is yet undiscovered, that in the darkness which has yet to be illuminated, has always fascinated me. I also enjoy very much the suspense of not knowing what powers are just beyond the veil, and possibly learning something about the nature of it. Most horror films are bigger on scares and weaker on meaning, but this film balances both better than I dare to expect.Unlike a number of other reviewers, I did not find this film lacking horror. It is not The Descent, nor is it The Devil's Backbone (I personally did not find Devil frightening at all). If you have high standards with dialogue and plausible character choices, there is no doubt you will at the very least appreciate how carefully and well- executed this film is. The acting and the plot are excellent, and I was shocked to find by the end of the film that it had managed to address the nature of horror in a way few films are able to do, as well as give one of the most satisfying horror endings I have ever experienced. If you enjoy supernatural horror, there is no doubt you will find much to appreciate in Before I Wake.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Truly Flanagan, but not his best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mike Flanagan grabbed my attention with Oculus, which not only was an exciting watch but actually kept me up at night after seeing it. Since then I've kept an eye on his other films. While I thought Hush was excellent, I found Absentia to be an interesting concept with a low quality execution. Before I Wake was similar to Absentia in that way.Before I wake was the least "horror" of Flanagan's horror film, in that the story mainly focuses on a sad mom of a dead child and how a foster child helps her heal (or makes it worse?) Even the scary parts are more thriller overall, and so I can see how people going in expecting something classically horrifying like Oculus or Hush could be disappointed. However, the strength of the film lies in the interesting story, even if it was not particularly frightening. If it was executed in a more interesting way, this movie would have been taken from okay to excellent.Overall, I'm happy I watched Before I Wake, but I would not care to re-watch it like I would with some of Flanagan's other films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie has what it takes to be a beautiful story. At first I want to say that the characters did a very awesome jobs! Jacob and Kate really revived their characters. So, little boy Cody has his own secret that is purely awesome. But as every other secret, it has it's own dark side. Brilliant part of the movie is that you can't see what is going to happen. It's totally new, and totally different. You all have my strong recommendations to watch this great artwork. So, as for the brilliant acting, they have choose a really good ones. But one thing goes wrong. This isn't horror, even if it has a horror elements. It's more psychological movie, that constantly playing your mind. Also, quite interesting is that butterfly story, because, you can never guess what's hiding inside of it. I'll use one of my old sentence to describe the movie: "Amazing things comes to those who wish hard enough".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film tells the story of a couple who takes in a foster son, after the death their own child. They slowly discover sinister happenings, and then realise that the foster sons dreams become reality.The synopsis makes the film sound very scary, but in fact it is more a thriller than a horror film. I think the foster son is very cute and likable, as he is so polite and well behaved. Kate Bosworth as a grieving mother is good, she portrays the role convincingly. I also notice the very good lighting effects throughout the film, enhancing the mood and suspense effectively. I enjoyed the last part of the story where mystery is being solved.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mike Flanagan is a genius. Thankfully, he has managed to make alternative horror movies despite the cliché industry. Before I Wake respects its audience: people who like supernatural stuff, with brains.The main conflict is a monster versus a mother. The monster has been created by a child's mind, who lives in Cody (the boy)'s nightmares. The mother is in grief by the accidental death of her son. Her husband wants to move on and has managed to push her to move on a little. That's when the adoptive child comes to their lives. But not an ordinary boy. He's got a gift: his dreams physically come to life while he is sleeping, and they can interact with reality.His dreams may be beautiful or scary, depending on his feelings. When is feeling safe, the movie becomes touchy, sad, emotional, total poetry. When Cody is afraid, even afraid of his own fear, it's a horror movie.And when Cody and the mother are coping with the problem in a very stupid way, increasing gaps and making things worse, a wide gap opens as a HUGE STORYTELING MASTER. So, we expect - oh no, it's coming that same BS again - but there comes logic, verisimilitude, every POV makes sense and the crisis/climax is a victory over fear.Jacob Trembling performance brings empathy. There is guilty, ignorance, he is heart driven...There are lessons to learn and a VERY SPECIAL END.</fullReview>

Kate Bosworth really gives her all in what may be her best performance yet.'Before I wake' is a dramatic fantasy/thriller with a bit of horror. It's clever, imaginative and sophisticated yet should please a general audience. Those who've experienced a great human loss will find resonance and maybe some solace in this film and ask themselves many questions. They may enjoy it even more, Rightly so. This film successfully manages to be both beautiful and horrifying. How? Watch and see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It starts off as hundreds of others of the genre do, it has predictable turns and stock screenplay, but Bosworth is pretty to look at and Jane is a honest role-player. If it weren't for the musical 'oohs' and 'aahs' of the soundtrack and the conventionally set atmosphere, the story would have a better grip as the main theme takes shape. But that would be too much to ask for, of course; they have to resort to the usual, trite audio dips and scream scares, flash obvious digital puppetry and so on. I stuck with it for a while to see if it'd shed the banality and become more grotesque, or actually creepy, or even interesting: it didn't, I so stopped halfway.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Before I Wake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In chronological order, Before I Wake is the third film from director Mike Flanagan, but it was "shelved" for 2 years due to the bankruptcy of its original distributor (Relativity Media). Ironically, his fourth film, Hush, was released on Netflix some weeks ago. But, well, independently from its turbulent past, I could finally watch Before I Wake, whose premise adds an interesting alternative to the tiring vindictive ghosts and generic demons clichés which accompany many "haunted house" films. I prefer not to reveal the nature of the phenomena tormenting the characters, so I will just say I found an interesting mystery with a big potential which, unfortunately, wasn't completely exploited. The central concept of Before I Wake seems more appropriate for a fantasy film... in fact, it reminded me of some tales written by Neil Gaiman. But encasing that idea into the horror genre sacrificed big part of its potential, and the result were the same terrifying "symptoms" as always, only differenced by their unusual origin. In other words, the phenomena faced by the characters have the same shape we have seen too many times in other films: strident noises, distorted faces, threatening shadows, etc. Having said that, the ending of Before I Wake appropriately ties the disparate elements of the screenplay, while placing the horrors the characters experienced on an unusually affective context. As for the cast, the solid performances from Kate Bosworth, Thomas Jane and the kid Jacob Tremblay (unforgettable since his monumental work in Room) help to balance the fantastic elements and attenuate some inconsistencies of the screenplay (such as certain questionable decisions from the parents and the main spectrum's confusing methodology). In conclusion, I found Before I Wake a competent horror film, even if that was the wrong genre to tell this story. And even though this is Flanagan's movie I have liked the least so far, I think it offers enough pros to deserve a moderate recommendation.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Now as far as I'm concerned when a movie makes me a little disgruntled about the actions of one or more of the characters then it's safe to say the movie has done what it was created to do. Jacob Tremblay is amazing and his perfect little boy with a secret side to him was pulled off incredibly without a hitch "I'm Sorry". Now Gorgeous Kate Bosworth was the character who made us cringe to no fault of her own the acting and dialogue from the writers was concise yet riveting. a lot of horror movies talk too much or not enough,a lot of them are non educational or don't offer enough clues to what's happening in their creepy minds as a director, Not the case with Mike Flanagan &amp; Jeff Howard directing answer writing the story is original perfectly Paced with explanation that are surprisingly believable and not following the same lane for ending the movie as 90% of doom &amp; gloom horror movies do. Thomas Jane also should be mentioned for becoming a horror actor with a cult following always amazing his latest role that blew everyone away in "The Veil" although this role was less demanding it was good but to him it was a cinch I'm sure of that. All in All the movie got 8/10 from me definitely recommend it. It wasn't the scariest but it was definitely very creepy and it was enough of it through out the whole movie with a good ending. Definitely worth a watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I read about this film I was stunned, this is the same guy that made oculus and hush both movies that I found very clever and enjoyable, as soon as I watched the trailer it look like a straight forward horror movie, I didn't mind that Kate Bosworth was in it the effects looked great and i saw it was the kid from Room. So everything pointed it was a great movie.I can honestly say it was good...but the trailer was very misguiding, to me this movie was a dream project that Guillermo del Toro or Tim Burton...in his prime would have made the this such an intense movie, I mean in more experience hands this could have been much better. This movie had horror elements but it felt more like dark fantasy than straight forward horror. And yes Kate Bosworth can actually make a believable performance from time to time, I was glad Thomas Jane was in most of it to make this movie more likable, but it felt flat as soon as Kate took the lead. The kid was good I can see him having a good career ahead of him. If you see the trailer trust me it's nothing like the movie it's way different still it's pretty watchable if you can excuse the C monster.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fantastical whimsy!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before I Wake carries a beautiful concept that could have moulded it into a better flick if it were not for its flaws.Jacob Tremblay is everywhere. His cuteness is a delight to watch. He walks in with a confident mien to deliver extraordinary cutesy bits that are both enthralling and adorable just like he is in person. At the end of the day he is delivering, who's complaining? Mike Flanagan's yet another horror venture packs in a fantastical story that has been well thought of when you give an eye to its concept. Dreams coming alive! A fancy world something only a beautiful mind could create. But the big question is how does it all pack in its capsule? Starting with the direction, Before I Wake takes off beautifully. But there are elements that gnaw at it gradually stopping it from reaching a charming gleam. The first one being Kate Bosworth's character Jessie. We could have used a better cast here. Even though a tad distant, which was needed for her character, for parts where it mattered the most, she appeared kind of absent emotionally. Thomas Jane, au contraire, fit the bill just fine.The second crucial part of the flick was its tangibility. Even though we were wading deep in an imaginary world, it is the natural things that surround it that help the flick to get carved in a realistic feel. Something which the movie lacked profusely. You often wonder, "Why is she not calling the police?" or "Why is she going there?" or "Where is everybody?" The latter one seems to be a factor that every horror movie overlooks.When you look at the scary quotient of the movie, it amasses plenty to scare you. There are great horror bits that are downright chilling to experience. However, there is nothing that will continue to haunt you for days owing to the great concept it tags along with its slow thoughtful pace.Screenplay has nothing to offer. Good scary movies consider this factor well, so it was a big downer there. Music is just meh, considering the chills it was supposed to furnish.SPOILERS: It is only after Before I wake reaches midway that it actually starts to dwindle. You find Jessie actually reaching out for shriveled dark enclaves fearlessly which makes you question how fearless she really is. You would have wimped out from that dreary situation or maybe called the police first, and made it a universal thing. But then you realize maybe she was carved with balls, and that the role wasn't really cut out for Kate Bosworth actually. Any other sentient cast that wore her expressions better would have made it relatable.When things reach its climax, you get a better glimpse into the story, as you understand who the "Canker Man" really was and how Cody's head projected it. The revelation doesn't tingle you much as you wonder how an imaginative nightmarish creation could be stopped by a memory glimpse. Throws you in a thoughtful territory for a second, which is actually very good for your head.Eventuality becomes dope-high on fancy, as it endeavours to show what the child could do with just his thoughts, as the mother tries to let the child embrace his powers. She creates a happy ending for everybody to bring them back to life. But till that point of time you have really gone aloof trying to figure out how could his thoughts bring back the dead like Sean into reality for good.A great concept that steers in a clouded zone owing to its shoddy direction, and the questions it leave you with.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A potentially amazing story crammed into a bit too familiar cliché form</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Before i wake" stars Jacob Tremblay as Cody, a child that believes to be haunted by some sort of supernatural force, and Kate Bosworth and Thomas Jane as his new foster parents. It is directed by Mike Flanagan, who became well known amongst horror fans for previously directing a highly underrated ghost possession movie "Oculus" and "Hush", a classic home invasion movie with a fresh twist.The film sets off with a great first act in which you get a glimpse of the true potential this premise really has. It gets you highly involved in the story which becomes increasingly emotional. But the movie doesn't build on that. It dilutes its very engaging story with a restricted and unimaginative approach off its makers, who succumb to using every horror cliché in the book. The horror elements are the weakest part, as they are poorly done and feel weirdly out of place when compared to the dramatic and far more mature content of the core story. The film loses its focus and somehow crawls to a very predictable "finale" of the second act. The third act found me unimpressed and almost given up. Im glad that i decided to give it the benefit of the doubt because with just a few very intelligent scenes, it pulled me right back into an emotional roller-coaster of an ending which makes up for the previously lazy storytelling.All of the actors do a fine job, although at some moments Kate Bosworth gives off a vibe of just going through the motion. Jacob Tremblay on the other hand gives a very convincing and mature performance."Before i wake" shouldn't be viewed as a horror flick, but rather as a very deep and touching story of love and loss of those closest to us. As Drama/Fantasy, this movie would have been amazing. As a Horror, it cant escape the feeling of a wasted potential. My rating : 7.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Then a butterfly led me to Jacob</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So, is Sunday at night, nothing on TV and I found myself looking for something to watch online, because I have a flu and cannot leave my place. Very disheartening to have a flu and nothing to do... just to see a movie. Then I saw the poster, and a butterfly led me to Jacob Tremblay. I don't know why. I just love Thomas Jane, but I didn't care, just wanted to see why people talk a lot about Tremblay. This was my opportunity to see what he can do. And, yes... thank you freaking flu for make me do this search! I just met a child who I will admire from now on. I loved the movie, it was a new point in dreams come true, not in the Freddy Krueger way but something original. We have the mind of a child working here, a very powerful mind working, and not kidding. Truth to be told: I have friends of mine, that lost a child (for cancer, incredibly) and Thomas did it great, he convinced me (as always) and reminded me that dad I knew in real life. Damn! Was exactly like him. Kate did it just fine, a good work. She is beautiful and stunning, a great actress, but didn't reminded me to that mother I met, I couldn't fine the pain I saw once there, or close to it. But, she acted well, her performance was very good. Just didn't reach me. Again, she is really stunning. The children in the movie did great also. Sometimes kids are distracting with bad acting (they are kids, is understandable) but wasn't the case here, they played their part very cool, fair to say. But Jacob is a huge spectacle! This kid is awesome, seriously. I haven't see that talent since young age of Dakota Fanning. I just loved him. He just have won a new fan here for life. Back to the movie, the script is very good, but it could have been better, specially with "Jessie" and "Mark" conversations. And they should do a deep work in the school. The photography is beautiful, and the images are so clear and "dreamful", the fantasy part is a work of art... and the creepy parts are creepy, totally awesome. Just a few jump-scares, enough and no more. It wasn't really necessary, because the very point in the movie are not the dreams or nightmares, but the loss (I don't have kids, but I cannot imagine worst pain than that loosing a son or daughter, and for what I saw in real life friends, it must been horrible) of a loved one, letting go, deal with pain, and what someone are capable of for getting back the one who loved. This movie is not horror or terror at all, but a psychological supernatural drama, or a psychological fantasy drama. Anyways, the end is just (no spoiling here) a bittersweet road, I liked it, and it touched me... is not the typical ending in this kind of movies, is not predictable. You have to understand it to like it, really. So: I jut loved it, and recommend it. 10/10 (it was 9/10 because I wanted more, but Jacob was so awesome that I can't help myself to give that point up) Watch it, and judge yourself.

		<fullReview>I just wish their could of been a novel as well to be able to hold onto the those precious moments longer, really delve fully into the thoughts and feelings of the protagonist, you almost wish it was a show and you could watch this protagonist grow up before your eyes for there is so much one can do with this gift/curse, whatever it is, it is doubtless an extraordinary experience for the viewer to be there whilst he goes through it all himself; learns to master his craft; learns how to attain wisdom; appropriate his needs dutifully; garnish art; adorn the dull; and perhaps even annihilate the "evil". There is so much material by which one can form moral dispositions bolstered by really rich undercurrents. For the material will always be teeming with creative scientific modes of life and all its vast ontological aspects and possibilities. He is playing God in a real life setting with an omni-omniscient voice you get only in novels. With his extraordinary gift every single scene has the potential to circumscribe philosophical ideologies, political and social doctrines; dogmas; social conditioning and god know what else whereon all of which can be expatiated to deliver the answers to burning questions which have plagued the learned, erudite minds with its all encompassing web which make up the warp and woof of our human condition, our human enigma since the dawning of the intellectual era. Hell you could do this show all over the world and it would yet sustain its unique and special value in all sorts of sociological paradigms. But I digress...This flix to me, seemed to have a immanent course on adoption twined with the undercurrent which raised questions about the common theme of filial bonds unto itself. Our fears as a father, as a mother, as a family, as an adopted family to which the spurious genetic bloody imprint which makes for an always narrow-minded, pathetic, intolerant puritanism to pervade and preside over tattling provinces with the rest of the captious and petty scandal-mongers. Growing up with these heretical social mores and corollary factions implanted over our formative years set the frame for an offing manifesting spectral tales disseminating from the propaganda machine whereupon we lick it up in nice obsequious dollops. We as potential parents tend to go through every other route before even beginning to consider this wonderful option. And as you can see in this super cool flix, the characters let us know through their own personal discourse how they were able to overcome these fallacious obstacles to by-pass the terrible filial crux scrawled in blood on stone whence the darkest most vile millenniums were borne. Whereby truly turning an absurd situation into something wonderful and completely natural for the parents and the poor lost tyke. Really truly a wonderful flix, you can put whatever tag, label, whereto file it away in a cozy lil' cubbyhole in which you feel most comfortable trying to gird another creative essence; but I would much rather simply call it a really fun super cool flix!</fullReview>
