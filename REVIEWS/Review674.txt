		<shortDescription>~Selena Quintanilla-Perez~</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Selena is the true-story of Selena Quintanilla-Perez, a talented young Mexican singer, who was discovered by her own father at the age of 10. Selena had everything going for her, a good family, whom she was very close with, a great husband, loads of fans and of course her music career that kept getting stronger. Selena had even won a prestigious Grammy award for Best Mexican/American Singer and was the most popular Latin singer at that time. Until, all that was taken away from her, when at the age of 23 in 1995, Selena's 'friend' and fan club manager, Yolanda Saldivar murdered her, after Selena had confronted Yolanda about money, she had stolen.I'm one of the many people out there who only heard about Selena in the last couple of years. I can't remember where I first heard of her. The internet, maybe, but the things I did hear were all good and she sounded like a very talented and popular young singer and of course I was really shocked to hear about how she died. I was really interested to watch the movie Selena and when I finally got to watch it, I thought it was really great. It tells you the whole story of Selena's life, from when she was just a young girl, to her meeting guitarist Chis Perez and secretly getting married to him, we see her singing at sold-out concerts, all the wonderful fans she had and not only that but we find out that Selena was planning to have kids and she was just about to release her first English language album, all until she was she was terribly murdered. I thought the end of the movie, where there was real footage of the real Selena, was beautifully done and it was great to see clips of the real Selena singing at her concerts, meeting her fans and just having fun with her family, friends and husband.I thought the whole cast in the movie were great, Jennifer Lopez played Selena really well and deserved any award she received or got nominated for. The rest of the cast including, Edward James Olmos, who played Selena's father and Jon Seda, who played Selena's husband Chris Perez did really well too.After watching the movie and hearing Selena, (Jennifer Lopez was lip-synching to Selena's voice. I thought that was good too.) I am going to get hold of some of Selena's music. I hope her memory will live on forever. Selena, the movie is highly recommended. Whether you're fan or not, see it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Superb job done - 10 out of 10</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>IMDb's 1,000 words max. limit seemed quite generous until I was faced with reviewing this one. For how could a mere thousand words adequately express the thoughts and feelings generated by sitting through two hours of watching a Lennon or McCartney, a Dion or a Jackson gradually taking hold of her God-given talents and rising to super-stardom only to have it cut short by what must be one of the most vile acts of murder the planet has ever witnessed. What if the first few hit singles or the first couple of albums of ABBA were all we ever got to hear because Agnetha or Frida was murdered at that point? It even goes so far as to make you wonder about the Beatles, even Bach, Mozart, or Beethoven.I admit I was a bit nervous when I rented the movie because I was worried that a sub-standard job may have been done to capture the short life of this young woman. Her music was really just the outcome of her virtuous self and the incredible qualities of courage, a genuine love for humanity, and a deep-seated patience that she obviously clung to. For, as the film points out, a Mexican-American singer is not easily accepted by Americans nor by the Mexicans. Selena also had to work at brining about unity among her family such as with her father's acceptance of her marriage. Needless to say, the film did not disappoint me in the least, for it portrayed this truth with class.Fortunately, the film did not "sugar-coat" the characters, as many biographical movies do - it confidently revealed the mistakes and some undesirable traits in the people it portrayed. In fact, the characters were so real, I forgot several times that I was watching a movie and thought I was sitting with these people laughing with them and sharing in their joy and in their pain. Jennifer Lopez was absolutely outstanding. There was so much depth, richness, and naturalness in her acting.I recognise also that it must have been very difficult for the actress who played Yolanda (manager of Selena's fan club and her murderer). To play the villain in order to help raise awareness of the life of a fabulous soul would be very difficult indeed.The beautiful candle-light vigils shown at the end of the film made me regret very much having not lived in Texas and been part of them at the time. I especially appreciated the fact that the film did not make Selena's death its focal point. It was much more of a celebration of the contribution she made in brining joy to the hearts of an unhappy world. This was its focus, even though Selena's death gave me a very sharp sting and made me cry. It is so sad but it cheers me that this film was made and that such a superb job was done on it. Thank you to all who worked on making this excellent film. (10 out of 10).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a lovely biopic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What a lovely biopic. I had barely heard of Selena when she was killed, and I'm no fan of Tejano music. But this picture was a wonderful tribute to the young talent. The movie is a celebration of her life, rather than fixating on her death, as one would expect with her family so involved (controlling) with the film. This approach also just felt right. I'm sure that Hollywood, if it had had its way, would have sensationalized this aspect to the max. I don't know how much of the film is factual, and how much is apocryphal. A local reviewer wrote that a true biography of Selena would have to wait a few years, and be done without a Quintanilla looking over both shoulders.All I can do is rave about Jennifer Lopez. Her beauty, her talent, her sheer magnetism flows right out of the screen. She was amazing. Since her biography subject died so young, she was able to avoid the problems, inherent in the genre, of trying to age the actress to match the aging of the subject. Constance Marie, who I'm not familiar with, was quite good as Selena's mother, although she did have to deal with the question of appearing to age 15 years. Every cast member seemed right for their part, and everyone did very well. The film seemed well-directed, in that I never thought about the director at any time during the film.Overall, the movie was very sweet, with obvious tragic overtones. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Moving Tribute</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jennifer Lopez proved that she was a high-class actress with this true story of the Tejano Superstar whose life was cut short by a disgruntled employee. Lopez shines and Edward James Olmos is super (as usual) as her tough-nosed father. The rest of the cast is adequate, but the show is shared between Lopez and Olmos. The screenplay is a little sappy, but fine overall. Director Gregory Nava is always focused and this keeps the film interesting throughout. A fine film all the way. 4 stars out of 5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Live Life To The Fullest Like Selena Did</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Selena' tells the fascinating story of the late Selena Quintanilla, the first famous female tejano singer. In her short life, with the support of her parents and husband, the vivacious young Selena lived the dream of every girl. Nava does a fine job of telling the story. He shows us how happy Selena was with her life (even though there were ups and downs) and she lived it to the fullest. In her short 23 years she achieved what would take a lifetime for some. This was a life that wasn't a waste because Selena knew hot to live life.But the best thing about 'Selena' is Jennifer Lopez. Those were the days when Lopez acted her heart out on screen as has also been apparent in 'Out of Sight' and 'Blood and Wine'. Not only that, but Lopez looks stunning. Many prefer the way she looks today but in 'Selena' there's an innocence and honesty about her beauty and this coupled with her natural and spirited performance is a delight to watch. The supporting cast that includes Edward James Olmos, Jon Seda and Constance Marie are all very good too.I loved the way the soundtrack was used in the film and it brings a lot of energy to the story. The cinematography is quite good but I did not like the 3 split screen.Even though we know the tragic fate of Selena, this film reminds us that it's more important to live a big life than a long life. Make full use of what you have and take your chance. That's what Selena did. She was loved by her friends and family and won the hearts of millions. Strongly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great movie and so so sad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't know much about the real Selena, so I don't know how much of the movie was fact and what was fiction. But even if this movie wasn't based on a real singing superstar, it would have been great to watch anyway.Jennifer Lopez is stunning in every way as Selena. She hits all the right chords as a teenager, a woman in love, a dutiful daughter and sister, and a singer adored by legions of fans. And she loved everyone of them right back. The actors playing her family are all great, too (especially her father). Ms. Lopez also has a sweet, natural chemistry with Jon Seda as Chris. Their relationship is so real because they were friends first...friends who fell in love.Ms. Lopez also does a great job lip-synching Selena's songs, and the ending will bring tears to your eyes. A must see!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I only sat down to watch this movie because I smelled sex appeal. Probably before the movie started I could not tell you which was Jennifer and which was Selena. But by the end of the movie I was an emotional basket case.The movie itself is simple and basic. It is innocent and honest and you kind of think to yourself that SELENA feels like a TV movie although the acting is solid. But unlike any TV movie something happens -- the movie jells -- and the end hits you as sudden and hard as a lightning strike.SELENA and MAN IN THE MOON are the only two movies that make my eyes water just by thinking of them.Powerful.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not expecting to enjoy this movie, I was very pleasantly surprised. Jennifer Lopez, Edward Olmos and the rest of the ensemble cast do a marvelous job in bringing the close-knit Quintanilla family to life. The screenwriters and director skillfully lead the viewer from the father's failed attempts at rock 'n roll in the early 60s through Selena's childhood and her eventual rocket to the top of the Tejano music charts as a young woman. Thankfully her murder is not addressed as a major plot item, its almost irrelevant. And the concert scenes are fantastic. Its Selena's voice and Lopez does an incredible job. Definitely worth a rental regardless of your musical tastes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie "Selena" was really good. The drama and humor was all good. I liked how the movie started off with her being little and showing how she started off in the industry. Her parents were very supportive of her. Her father was really hard on them when they had to practice. They never liked to rehearse. Her brother and sister were both good people to be around. I liked all of the songs that were played in the movie. Her and her husband Chris were a very cute couple. The way she wanted to grow up and have a farm with lots of kids was really cute. All of her music was great. I think that Selena was a very beautiful and talented women. The way she died was very sad and horrible. She will be truly missed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>watchable, but not memorable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first saw "Selena" a year ago when I showed it as a video to middle school Spanish students. While many of them expressed disappointment the first time I turned on the classroom lights and stopped the VCR 1-2 minutes before the bell sounded, I knew that for me the movie was lacking something.That "Selena" the movie failed to greatly impress me did not mean that Selena the entertainer did not appeal to me or that the tragic end to her life had no affect on me. I had hoped, however, to learn more. Since Selena's music and career interested me little before this film, I could not judge her story as to its accuracy and assumed that the different scenes -- Abraham Quintanilla's rallying and pushing his young children to rehearse, the group's playing for both enthusiastic and disillusioned audiences -- occurred in reality much as I observed them. I did not, in other words, have a basis on which to doubt the story's veracity.I also had little reason to degrade the performances. Edward Olmos Jr. did his usual dynamic work, this time as Selena's protective and volatile father, and Jennifer Lopez did a credible job making me feel as if I were watching Selena, not JLo. For the most part, in fact, each cast member spoke his/her lines naturally.What the filmmakers presented, how the characters behaved, and how they spoke, then, concerned me less than what they had to say. Hearing another aspiring musician or singer talk about achieving her dreams, assert her desire to marry because "I love him and he loves me," describe the details of the quaint country home she envisions for herself once she has had enough of concerts and tours, enjoy a rare exclusive conversation with her father in which he tells her, "you have always been my little girl," made me cringe. After so many other similar stories about entertainers, such as "La Bamba," "The Buddy Holly Story," and "Sweet Dreams," "Selena" often seemed formulaic. While remaining faithful to what truly transpired in Selena's life, the writers could have, I thought, put together an original script.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>oh my gosh. i watched this movie in Spanish class last week, and before this, i had never heard of selena. after watching the film, i have now downloaded about 26 songs of selena's and bought the movie for myself.i absolutely loved this movie from beginning to end. jennifer lopez did an amazing job. i couldn't tell which parts were the real selena and which ones were lopez. all of the actors/actress in this film were wonderful. i fell in love with the family from the moment i saw them. they're all so believable and i actually forgot i was watching a movie. i felt every bit of happiness and joy and pain that they experienced. i fell in love with selena. if lopez portrayed her accurately (i wouldn't know because i had no idea who she was before i watched the film) then she must have been one incredible person. its just so sad her life was cut so short.at the very end of the film, when they threw the white rose on the stage i thought.. oh no! something's gonna happen. the next thing you see is her on a stretcher and a radio announcer's voice saying that she had been shot. that moment killed me. i started bawling right in the middle of class! i loved her from beging to end and to see her die that way at such a young age is heartbreaking. i was only 5 when she died, so i didn't know about it, but her fans at that time must have been mortified. if jennifer portrayed her correctly, the real selena must have been..(besides and outstanding singer) a truly wonderful human being.the tribute at the end is amazing. i loved the candlelit vigil for her at the end with the real pictures and clips of her. i love how the movie was focused of the celebration of her life and how much she accomplished in a short amount of time and not her tragic death. for that many people to be so affeccted by her death.. well that must mean that she was really truly and incredible human being, and she is missed by many and will never be forgotten.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You're not human if you don't shed tears for her</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Back in 1993 or thereabouts, I was watching Univision one weekend night (for variety and to learn some Spanish), and they were airing a special: a live Selena concert. I remember thinking how beautiful and talented she was, but also how BIG. Madonna had nothing on her level of popularity, which seemed almost to exceed it. Barely twenty years old, Selena's meteoric rise seemed inevitable. I had become a fan of hers after watching the Univision concert, and knew of her name and her work, but never thought that it would be the last time I would ever see her. Only James Dean's premature death in 1956 rivals this tragedy for the loss of talent at such a young age. It is scary to think of what Selena would have become had she simply not been killed.The movie focuses on Selena's rise to fame as a crossover Tejano music star, more popular south of the border than in the United States, but becoming famous in both lands nonetheless. Other than Selena (Jennifer Lopez), the movie centers around her family, her husband Chris Perez (a very competent Jon Seda), and her strong-but-loving father, Abraham (Edward James Olmos in what is easily the best performance of his career).Lopez checked her attitude at the door for this film, and plays Selena with reverence. Her resemblance to Selena and singing ability made her perfect for this role, and Olmos made an excellent second-fiddle. The scenes between father and daughter transcended fame and showed the normalcy of Quintanilla family life as the backdrop for the spiraling fame that threw them into chaos, such as when Selena had planned to tell her father about her sudden marriage but the radio had beaten her to it.As we all know, Selena was tragically murdered by her fan club president, a woman I will not name so as not to give her any more fame (I urge others to do this as well). How someone with such a precious access to a precious individual could snuff out a life so young, so talented, and destined to be one of our greatest superstars is beyond comprehension. This crime was senseless even among other senseless crimes.This is a loss that in some ways has still never been recovered from. Women like Selena come around once in a lifetime, and she was it for us. Sadly.My heart goes out to her family for having to endure such a horrifying experience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jennifer Lopez is beautiful as Selena. ***1/2 out of ****</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SELENA (1997) ***1/2Starring: Jennifer Lopez, Edward James Olmos, Jon Seda, Constance Marie, and Jacob Vargas Written and directed by Gregory Nava 127 minutes Rated PG (for mild language and sensuality) By Blake French: I am not a fan of Selena Quintanilla, and I still loved Gregory Nava's "Selena." It was a respectable movie on its own level; the film would have worked even if there never was a professional celebrity singer of the same name. It's filled with inspiring style and lovely glamour. This is one of the better biography movies to come down the road in some time.The film stars the talented Jennifer Lopez as the famous singer in the title roll. The development of her character is what makes the production so effective. In biographies, we need as much information as possible about the person in focus as possible, and "Selena" starts at her childhood. She is one of the many in the Quintanilla family: the father, Abraham, the mother, Marcela, and the siblings, Abie, Suzette, and of course Selena. Abraham involves the kids with music very early in their lives. After hearing his daughter's voice talents, how could he resist. Some days, the kids did not want to practice their instruments and music abilities, but discipline is what makes things work.The film begins an emotional journey into the life of the Quintanilla's. Abraham's long awaited dream of opening his independent Spanish restaurant has come true. His children are the entertainment. Although much to his wife's dismay, he soon quits his current occupation to manage his new restaurant full time. Again, a big success, for the first few months, anyway. Before long, however, the restaurant is bankrupt and his family is forced to close it down--leaving them no where to go, except to sell their happy little house and buy a motor home for the family to live in.Selena's father becomes the antagonist--being forceful, controlling and difficult. He is the one who objects to the family's ideas. Abraham is the man who will never allow his daughter to get married. He is the person who cares so much about his family, that sometimes he thinks that they can't do anything right. The development of the Quintanilla family is perfect. Selena, although the centerpiece of the plot, is jumbled in the family atmosphere with little significance above the rest of the members in her household. This concept makes the biography believable and heartfelt. The only problem I had with these folks is the old, reused idea of having the strict father as the villain for most of the movie. We have seen this concept so many times before, and while it does, as always, add some tension in the story line, the film never gets anywhere with the theme, and throughout the picture, Abraham has varied in character mood--lacking consistency. Jennifer Lopez is so much better playing a character like Selena Quintanilla than some of the varied characters she has been in the past. In particular, the dreadful "U-Turn" and "Anaconda" characters did not fit her personality in the least. Selena is the character who she was born to star as, and what a wonderful, inspiring job she does. I cared about these characters, and if not for the performances it may have been another story.  The movie offers a touching romantic subplot--that also happens to be bull-headed and stubborn. The audience doesn't mind this flawed story, however simply because it is propelled by the performances and enchanting romantic chemistry. There are lots of emotions flying around in the film, but even that doesn't hold it back from becoming a clear, accurate-looking piece of work."Selena" is a biography worth seeing and then some. Featured are adorable characters, exquisite performances, a believable and historical plot line, and a lot of irresistible idyllic chemistry. However, at the same time, suffers from too many emotional distractions and conventional clichés. The film could have been better...but it didn't necessarily need at be.Brought to you by Warner Bros.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I never really knew of Selena until I first watched the Selena movie. I must say I was very young when she died so I didn't know much of what happened until I saw the movie. From the first time I saw Selena I fell in love with this movie. Selena is one of my all time favorite movies. The movie Selena starts with her at a young age and ends with the day she dies. I really like how the movie incorporated her childhood and how her music business started because it is an important key part of her life. In the movie they also incorporated the use of the real Selena's voice when they show her making her music and in her concerts--I thought that was a brilliant idea. Since I have seen the movie Selena, I now enjoy listening to Selena's Tejano music. Overall the movie is very well put together and shows the most significant parts of her life to show her success. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who has not seen it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A biopic of an exceptional talent.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the heart-felt story of 23-year-old Selena Quintanilla-Perez,played flawlessly by Jennifer Lopez. Selena was a Texas born singer of Tejano music and going from a cult attraction to breaking into an international phenomenon. How factual this film is can be questionable; but very interesting nonetheless.As the rising star was showing brilliance, she was gunned down by the very president of her own fan club in 1995. Shown through flashbacks her father Abraham(Edward James Olmos), a typical stage father/manager, finally realizes how enormously talented and loved his daughter is. There is the extreme closeness of her family, the marriage to guitarist Chris Perez(Jon Seda)and the snowballing success being ended by tragedy(only dealt with via taped news reports). Actual Selena concert footage is used; and this film overflows with music. Enough can't be said of Lopez in her portrayal...she is so enjoyable, lovable and s-e-x-y! Others featured in the cast: Jackie Guerra, Constance Marle, Jacob Vargas, Rebecca Lee Mezza, Alex Meneses and Sal Lopez.</fullReview>

Selena is encouraged to sing by her father and is a natural super star because everyone in her family was musically inclined and her our mother was able to teach her some great dancing steps. There is romance in the film between Selena and a guitar player in the musical group, who her father is not too happy about, because he really does not want to lose his girl in marriage. There is plenty of laughter and great musical numbers and very sexy outfits and some very comical scenes and at the same time plenty of drama and you will definitely need a box of tissues.

		<shortDescription>A must see for Selena fans...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>...and for those who have not yet discovered the talent of Selena, the young Tejano singer whose life and career were cut drastically short.I was one of many people who remembered Selena in 1995, unfortunately I did not know of her until she was murdered. I remembered going to see the film in the theater, which is an experience to remember. This was the film that made Jennifer Lopez a star. I am not a fan of "J-Lo", but this is the only film of hers that I felt she did a decent acting job in. This is a well-intentioned, sentimental film that the Quintanilla family released to show the world what a charismatic and talented singer Selena was.The movie has funny scenes like when Selena and her band's bus, "Big Bertha" gets stuck in the middle of the desert and two cholos in a Low Rider stop by to help pull them out of the ditch, but unfortunately, they take the bumper right off the bus! ("This bumper's goin' on the wall of my garage, carnal!"). The scene where Selena and her friend are snubbed by the snotty saleslady at the upscale boutique at the mall is remiscent of "Pretty Woman" - a great scene - one of the best in the whole movie. It also has sad scenes that will make you cry. Of course, they took creative license with a few scenes in the movie, but the whole essence of the film is captured very well. And of course, the soundtrack is full of Selena's wonderful songs.Selena is in a long line of stars whose lives were devastated by tragedy: Janis Joplin, James Dean, Jimi Hendrix, Elvis, Jim Morrison, Karen Carpenter, Marilyn, etc. Selena was the last person I have seen with that kind of unique charisma and talent, a real star, someone who had paid her dues playing gigs on the road with her family when she was very young. If she had lived she would have been very famous. Another theme in this movie is about the American Dream, if you work hard and don't quit, you will make your dreams into reality.It's a movie mainly for Selena fans, and not for cynics. I have read many reviews about "cornball", "cheese", "awful acting and script", and so forth, and yes, some people are going to hate it, but go ahead and give it a try. It might surprise you.P.S. Before the movie came out, a casting call was made all over the country for unknowns to try out for the role of Selena. When I was 15, I was one of those who had auditioned. Unfortunately, it was a publicity campaign for the movie since they had already cast Jennifer Lopez shortly after.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great movie, minor things.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was great, with some minor details taken not into consideration. An example is when she got her Grammy, I got footage, she doesn't say what the movie says she says. She says something different. Other than minor details like that, it was an amazing movie and I think that if Selena was able to see it, she would be very proud of the job J.Lo and the other talented actors did to portray her life.

		<fullReview>I never thought that this would turn out to being one of the most alively portrayed movies I've ever seen. Jennifer Lopez really portrayed Selena as if she were still alive. It's hard to believe that such a young singer has gone through so much to succeed. What hurt me most was when her life was suddenly taken mercilessly and cold-heartedly from her. I had a great deal of respect for her. I give this flick a 10/10 ***** for outstanding portrayal.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Selena was the Spanish answer to Celine Dion. Unlike Celine, she was not a native Spanish speaker. The film is actually touching at times. There is a feeling of great sadness to what might have become of Selena. This film is a great tribute to somebody who died too young. Her father played by Edward James Olmos is superb. Lupe who plays Yolanda is also excellent. Constance Marie who plays Selena's mother is actually wonderful. I thought it was Olmos' real life wife, Lorraine Bracco. They look so similar. Jackie Guerra is wonderful too as her sister. I wished that Hollywood would look at the fact that this is a Texas' story. Selena was a Texas girl who also happened to be Spanish American. She loved and treated her fans with respect. My favorite scene is at the Los Angeles mall, the snobby salesperson almost refuses to try a dress "It's $800.00." Rather than make a fuss, Selena acts very classy about it. Then one Mexican sees her and the word spreads like a California wildfire around the mall, the store is mobbed with shoppers and store workers. The snobby saleswoman can't believe her eyes. "Who's Selena?" she asked. She's surprised to know that the Spanish customer is a huge star in Mexico but not in Los Angeles. She's overcome with embarrassment. After all Selena is only in Los Angeles for the Grammys.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>We had to watch this in Spanish class and review it as part of our unit about movies, so it's actually my second review for this. I wasn't expecting that much, and my expectations were pretty much met. I understand that people loved Selena and that she was an icon that defined a lot of people's culture, but that doesn't help me appreciate this adaptation of her life. I've always found that I learn a lot more about life from fiction than from stories about actual events. Plus, I always feel like movies about real people and events are pushing you to take them seriously because they "actually happened", which is annoying because a lot of times those movies are a bit lame. This biopic had a lot of the usual negative symptoms, and there's nothing terribly praiseworthy about it.The story doesn't have a whole lot of structure to it, which is not surprising since most people's lives do not follow dramatic patterns. There are some attempts at cohesive plot threads, but these don't come out great. Part of this is due to the nature of the events they are based off of, and part of it is because of insufficient screen writing. The most prominent of these is Selena's strained relationship with Chris, which I think may have been over- dramatized but I'm ignorant as to how it actually panned out. The final conflict with Yolanda would not have worked at all in a fiction story, but I think they did a decent job introducing Yolanda and her friendship with Selena through the limited time that they were afforded with her character. In some ways, it seems like it would have been a better decision to not end the movie with Selena's death, but I think it was necessary since it was geared toward mourning fans that took Selena's passing as personally as that of a family member.Selena is given personality, but I didn't buy in to all of it. She is shown as having a carefree joy that many female protagonists of the past have had, but I'm not sure I believe this to be accurate given her lifestyle. Abraham was easily the best all around character and probably had the best acting performance from Edward Olmos. Chris felt like a pretty flat character that never really got the right kind of attention on screen, as in maybe getting his own scene.The execution is satisfactory at many points and even a bit noteworthy during the concert montages, but there are a number of problems with it as well. Jennifer Lopez does not exactly give a bad performance, but it definitely could have been better. Selena's younger actress was unimpressive at a few points, particularly in her generic portrayals of different emotions. Yolanda's actress probably gave the worst performance out of anyone, followed by Chris. However, Chris might have been poorly written rather than poorly acted. Some of the dialogue flowed nicely, and I didn't notice any problems with it at most points, but whenever the characters' words discussed some event that had been skipped over, it came off as really forced.If you're a Selena fan, you've probably already seen this and you might like it if you haven't. If you aren't a fan of biopics, this is not one of the stronger products of the genre. There isn't much of a cohesive story, which may be worth knowing for some. I wouldn't say that it's worth spending money on, but it's bound to be pretty cheap anyways. Overall Rating: 6.4/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jennifer Lopez Shines As Selena</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Selena is a biographical drama about the life and career of the late Tejano music star Selena, a recording artist who was well known in the United States and Mexico before she was shot to death.It stars Jennifer Lopez as Selena.Edward James Olmos and Constance Marie co-stars.It was written and directed by Gregory Nava.This film concentrates on Selena's relationship with her family and her rise to fame, dealing only briefly with her tragic death. Abraham Quintanilla is a veteran musician who leads a family-based singing group, The Dinos. At a young age, he notices that his daughter Selena has a strong singing voice, and he works her into the act. However, as she grows older, Selena wants to establish her own musical identity; while her heritage is Mexican-American, her primary language is English, and her favorite artists are American pop acts like Donna Summer. While Selena and Abraham sometimes argue about the musical direction of the group, he always respects and supports her talent, and her blend of Tejano roots music and danceable pop rhythms soon sparks a revolution in Latin music. Selena later earns the wrath of her father when she becomes romantically involved with Chris Perez, a rebellious and long-haired guitarist hired to play with the group, but when they elope and Selena convinces Abraham that their love is sincere, Chris is welcomed into the family. After a long string of successes on the Latin charts and playing to a sellout crowd at the Houston Astrodome and a crowd of 100,000 at a stadium in Monterey, Mexico, Selena begins recording her first album in English, which is expected to make her a mainstream star. However, the fates decreed it was an album she would never complete.The movie surmounts its connect-the-dots approach to its heroine's life to create an appealing, energetic look at a too-briefly soaring musical star.Also,it is a simple story of hope and triumph, of one girl with the drive to succeed defying the odds and following her dream that could truly inspire the viewer to achieve their goals.Finally,Jennifer Lopez truly shines in her performance in the title role as she elevates the film immensely with her radiant and energetic performance.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't know bow many people in India has seen this movie. I did not about Selena at all before this movie. I had not seen any movie of Jenifer Lopez as well before this. One thing I can say the world definitely lost a great singer very early and Ms.Lopez is definitely an under rated actress. She is better off going good cinema than her pop singing career. Over all a great movie with excellent songs. The star cast was good and deserves a credit for the casting director. The director also goes a good job. But not to ignore that the storyline was true so that added to the whole effect of the movie. Deserves a all 10 star rating.</fullReview>

Because prior to that, my only memory is of the song 'Dreaming of You'. One of the beautiful songs I had ever heard.Really recommended. This movie, that is.</fullReview>

This movie showed me that you should follow your heart even when others don't agree with it.This movie was a great example of gender discrimination. Even though Selena knew that the world might not accept her she still worked hard at what she loved. This movie was even more moving because it was a true story. To think that she worked all her life to do something she loved and when she finally got it , it was taken from her. I give the movie a 10++++++++++++++++++++ because it showed the struggles that Mexican-Americans went through. they have to be more Mexican than the Mexicans and more American than the Americans</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Every time I watch this movie, it is as if I am seeing it for the first time. I am so entertained by the magnificent performance of Jennifer Lopez and all the cast members, and I cry each time as I have to witness the death of Selena. I don't think I will ever be able to hear Selena's music without crying. She was beautiful, brilliant, and so very talented. This movie is tastefully done and I recommend it to anyone who loves Selena, good music, and those who have tender hearts. I have to admit that until I saw the movie, I did not know of Selena or her music. She was born four years before my son and somehow her music eluded me when she was alive. But, after seeing the movie, I became a great fan of her music, her voice, her talent in every respect, and her dignity and grace as a human being. Selena seems to be as natural and real as she is said to be and that is a rare quality today in so many entertainers. May her spirit live on forever and her music fill the hearts of generations to come.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SELENA, in my opinion, is an excellent biopic of one of the greatest Tejano singers of all time. The performances were smashing, the soundtrack was great, and the casting was just right. Ever since the first time I saw it, I've been wondering if Jennifer Lopez actually sang the vocals or lip-synched them. Since she has released some albums, I'm going to assume that she actually sang them. Anyway, I thought that Selena (Jennifer Lopez) gave a smashing performance every time she was performing. If you ask me, Mr. Quintanilla (Edward James Olmos) was a little too strict about Selena dating Chris (Jon Seda). In conclusion, if you are a die-hard fan of Jennifer Lopez or like Selena's music, I highly recommend this excellent biopic of one of the greatest Tejano singers of all time. You're in for a real treat and a good time, so don't miss this one.</fullReview>

Plus this is probably the only good performance from Jennifer Lopez I have ever seen, all of the rest of the movies just seem to make fun of her. The music was all performed well, but it's also really interesting to listen to Selena's actual albums (they're pretty good if you ask me). So in the end, this film does Selena justice, and also proves to me that Jennifer Lopez can act if she really wants to.</fullReview>

Because acting is not something done over night the producers decided on using an experienced actress in Jennifer Lopez. The movie was too campy. Being a Selena fan, myself I really didn't appreciate the many stereotypes in the film. For one thing, I don't say something in Spanish then translate myself in English. "Queremos bailar... We wanna dance!" The music montage during "Bidi Bidi Bom Bom" was good. Still on and on the story still managed to get across. It would be nice to possibly see a Director's cut of the film.

		<shortDescription>Selena: Forever a Star</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie Selena is "A story of a girl who had the spirit to believe in a dream and the courage to make it come true." Selena Quintanilla was a singer, songwriter, actress, and fashion designer. Her talents touched so many people around the world. Yet all of it ended with one tragic event: one of her dear friends had killed her. Jennifer Lopez, who plays Selena in this film, reminded the world of the loss of a loved hero, friend, and role model, who never forgot her roots. When Selena was young, her father saw a great talent in her. He knew that one day she could make it to the top. And that is just what she did! They started a family band called Selena Y Los Dinos, where Selena was the singer, her brother Abie (Jacob Vargas) was on bass guitar, and her sister Suzette (Jackie Guerra) was on drums. Her father managed and produced for the band. All through their endeavors, he still saw that talent in Selena. He made Selena learn how to sing in Spanish so that she could sing to the Latino communities. Through singing, she learned to speak Spanish fluently. In my opinion, Edward James Olmos portrayed Selena's father perfectly in this film. He portrayed the emotions that a real father might have during a similar situation, really well.Selena was very close to her family, and they supported her through her journey. With her new fame and fortune, she lifted them out of poverty. She never forgot where she came from! This movie captured the essence of family in a way that I have never seen before. It focused not so much on her death, but more on celebrating her life, and how far she came. Since the movie was released soon after Selena died, they decided to honor her music by using the original recordings in this movie. Jennifer Lopez was coached to lip sync the Selena songs. Yolanda Saldivar (Lupe Ontiveros) was a close friend to Selena, and was her fan club president. As time went on, she became more obsessive and close to Selena, Selena was at the peak of her career when she figured out that Yolanda was taking money from her. They portrayed this event really well in the movie, yet there was a lack of detail. Since the movie was focused on celebrating Selena's life, they thinly skimmed over her death. I would've enjoyed the movie even more if they would've added a bit more detail to the event of her death. Selena called Yolanda in and asked her about the situation. Selena knew Yolanda was lying and was going to fire her, when a few days later, Yolanda shot and killed Selena. Latino's and Americans all around the world mourned the loss of Selena. In the end of this movie, they showed actual archived pictures of Selena fans. In these pictures, the fans were holding candles and pictures of Selena. The end of this movie is so special and emotional. It shows how meaningful Selena was to people all around the world. She was an amazing person and a great performer. I hope her charm and talent is ever forgotten! This movie is truly an inspiration to all!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worthy bio-pic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I enjoyed this excursion into Tex-Mex culture via the tragically short life story of Tejano star Selena.I didn't know much about this singer, murdered at age 23, before stumbling upon this film on cable TV. And while the movie is full of Selena's hip-twisting performances, I found much of her singing to be forgettable. However, I did find the storyline quite moving. Rebecca Lee Meza and Jennifer Lopez both shine as younger and older versions of the singer. The film shows how her ex-musician father, Abraham (played movingly by Edward James Olmos), created a family band using second-hand instruments, and discovered his youngest child's talent for the stage practically by accident.Also excellent here are Jon Seda as Chris Perez, the band guitarist initially mistrusted by Abraham, and Lupe Oliveros as Yolanda Saldivar, the matronly fan-club president who was suspected of misappropriating funds.Like many bio-pics, this one has problems in its pacing, placing too much emphasis on early family dynamics and too little on the clan's relationship with Saldivar. Wikipedia tells us that Selena had remained loyal to the woman, despite others' misgivings. Why doesn't the movie elucidate all this? The viewer is left in the dark as to why Selena went by herself to meet with Salvidar once things had become tense. The film's final segments, showing a panicked Saldivar barricaded in her car, holding the murder weapon to her head -- "I don't deserve to live!" -- juxtaposed with a crowd of mourning fans holding candles - - is very powerful.This story provides an excellent blueprint for a very old-fashioned path to success: Work hard and don't give up!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Selena's story... or Abraham's?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, I am a Selena Quintanilla Perez fan. I consider her as a performer to be one of the most exciting, vibrant, spirited and sensuous artists who ever captured public imagination. However, two things unsettled me about this biopic: the first was that it seems to have been made for less than sincere reasons and more in order to 'sell' the Selena brand to consumers posthumously, even though the subject matter was deceased and had no input as to how her story would be portrayed. That leaves a bad taste in my mouth, for starters.Secondly, the movie - which has a ridiculously long running time for a biopic - seemed to be more about Abraham's life than his daughter's, like he was the true protagonist and his daughter was merely the vessel through which he lived his dreams (making her seem like a prisoner). It was not flattering at all: in fact, watching the film and trying to put myself in Selena's shoes, I got an overbearing sense of claustrophobia on her behalf, and rooted for her to emancipate herself from Abraham's patriachal value system. For obvious reasons, this never happens and by movie's end, the murder of Selena by her obsessive assistant Yolanda seems like an incidental, random event that is not even connected to the actual narrative being told: that of a daughter who feels obligated to make her father's dreams come true.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to say, well done to Jennifer Lopez for playing a music star whom I never heard of before. Selena reminds me of Michael Jackson as both father's became their managers at a very young age. The father seemed to be very pushy and was concentrating more on Selena then himself. I think Selena should've been a worldwide superstar since I have never heard of the Latin American genre 'Tejano' or Selena herself before. However she didn't live long, it was so sad that she was shot by someone who used her money and her reputation. I feel so sorry for her family that they had to go through it for the rest of their lives! She was so young at 23, she could've been touring all over the world if she had the chance! The movie was very good, I'm glad they picked JLO for the movie because she looks so much like Selena. Selena would be so grateful that this film is based on her. RIP Selena &#x1f49f;</fullReview>

The local news stations had footage of countless thousands of young Hispanic girls waiting in line to audition. Truly dishonest! As for the actors and actresses, hard to say who was more annoying, Jennifer Lopez and her silly giggle and over-acting or Jackie Guerra, the overweight sister and drummer of the band who never missed a scene where you didn't want to slap her for her annoying portrayal of sister Susie.Jon Seda and Constance Marie are the only redeeming characters, playing their roles without the annoyance factor.You can save time and just buy Selena's Greatest hits CD since the only reason to watch this film is for the music.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Simple biopic with Lopez and the great Edward James Olmos</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a biopic of Selena Quintanilla-Perez (Jennifer Lopez). Back in 1961 Corpus Christi, Texas, Abraham Quintanilla faced racism from the whites on the one hand, and rejection from the Mexican community of their 'white' music on the other hand. He (Edward James Olmos) settles down in Lake Jackson, Texas raising a family. He starts a family band despite objections from wife Marcela (Constance Marie). Then he starts a restaurant and quits his job again against Marcela's wishes. He keeps pushing the kids especially young Selena even when the restaurant goes under. He's a true stage dad. She falls for hired guitarist Chris Perez (Jon Seda) and gets married in secret.Jennifer Lopez comes in after 30 minutes. It's fine because the childhood story is actually good, and they've got the great Edward James Olmos holding it together. EJO is truly amazing. Jennifer Lopez shows that she has the acting chops. Writer/director Gregory Nava has made the standard biopic. It's sweet. The family drama is good. They don't push anything outrageous. The killing is relegated to the back and Yolanda Saldivar isn't explored that deeply.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>disclaimer: my movie rating scale is not based on technicalities but based on how it made me feel. really good movie. i would have to say this is probably the only good movie jennifer lopez has ever done, and while that isn't saying much, this is still worth the watch. you get to see selena grow up and start performing (even though when the child actress "sings", it's sorta unrealistic and can take away from the experience), and you also get to see her rise to fame, which is more hinted at rather than shown since all the major events of her performing just seem to sorta happen. and then you see it all end way too early.the love story between the two characters is really sweet. selena was portrayed as really sweet and likable (as i'm sure she was due to the interviews that can be seen on youtube), and the ending will definitely make you cry if you're able to really get into the film.kinda fast paced, still enjoyable. feel-good movie, even though the ending is really sad. has a lot of rewatch-ability to it, 10/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was afraid of this movie when I was a kid, but when I grew up, I realized that "hay mas a esta historia que el ojo" (Translation: "There's more to this story than meets the eye".) The biopic Selena is one of my favorite movies. The reason why is because in the 90's, Jennifer Lopez was a Fly Girl in the sketch comedy show "In Living Color", was co-starring in "Money Train" and "Blood and Wine" and made her biggest starring role yet, even before her music career went big. There was a few controversies involving the movie, where Lopez was a Puerto Rican from New York, and the real Selena was a Mexican-American from Texas. But then again, all of us accepted Lopez playing Selena and we enjoyed the way she made Selena a real star. In Gregory Nava's film, it begins and ends at the big concert for Selena to become a very huge crossover star at the Houston Astrodome in 1995. Then it really ends with the death of Selena being done by her insane employer (Lupe Ontiveros). (No name spoiler here, but you already know.) In the good ol' days in Corpus Christi, young Selena (Rebecca Lee Meza) was raised well by her father, Abraham (Edward James Olmos) who was in a failed band called the Dinos with two other friends back in the 50's. After hearing Selena sing "We Belong Together" with him, this sparks Abraham to bring The Dinos back to life. Who knew that years later, we get to meet Selena, all grown up and living "la vida dulce" (Translation: "The sweet life") as a Tejano star who would be the biggest Tejano star ever. During the movie, we get to see everything in a condensed, but fast, pace of 127 minutes, the relationship involving her family including mama Marcela (George Lopez's Constance Marie), her romantic relationship between the rock-and-roll guitar player, Chris Perez (Jon Seda), her music (done by the real Selena, not Lopez) and yes, we do get to meet Yolanda herself, with a lot of character developing. Lopez gave a really great performance as Selena, and with the help of Miranda Garrison's choreography, captures the essence of Selena, the way she talks, the way she moves and the way she delivers the energy. The same can be said for Olmos, who can be both funny and dramatic at the same time. (Please pay attention to the argument between Selena, Abraham and Chris.) He also delivers what should've been a washed-down speech about Mexican-Americans into a very smart and charismatic speech. Selena is "muy, muy entretenido" (Translation: "Very, very entertaining.") However, when you do get to the end of the film, there are hankies to be of good use when the candlelight vigils and the archival footage shows and the mourning of a fabulous star comes on-screen. It's very heartbreaking and very emotional in the way that has been done and the final image will make you cry in a good way to prove that she was still there with us after all.</fullReview>

She died at the tender age of 24. She loved to sing and dance. she would love to have children but never gave birth to any. She left behind a husband, mother,father,brother, and sister and many, many, many, fans.Her father always believed that she had what it took to become big and she did and she broke many, many,grounds in the Latino industry</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In my personal opinion Selena was a good movie, but it wasn't the best movie in the world. Although it wasn't the best movie I've seen, it had a very good message behind it. It taught me that if you have a dream follow it and don't let anyone stop you from pursuing that dream.Selena, to me, was the type of person that was independent and liked to do things on her own and without anyone telling her. When Selena stood up to her father I thought was her first step to standing up for herself and becoming a woman. Selena had me on edge towards the end. For those who have not seen the movie,the end will shock you. Overall, I thought that Selena was a very good movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Selena, one of the most talked about Latinas, is almost flawlessly portray by Jennifer Lopez. The movie is documentary of the success of the singer from how she started as little girl to when she blew up when she was in her 20's. Selena was killed at 23 by her president of her fan club and the movie fills all of her greatest moments. From some of her best concerts like her concert at the Houston dome to when the crowd almost collapsed a stage with her and her band. The movie also shows her relationship times with her family. At first she didn't want to pursue music, but her dad convices and wonders if he might start regretting it. The acing is great and music is awesome and can be loved by everyone. In closing, this movie won't disappoint and who doesn't love J. Lo.'s luster booty. 5 out of 5.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think that Selena was a good movie. It was sad how she died at the end, but the movie showed a good portrayal of her music career. It showed how she first started out playing with her brothers and sisters at their home, to her growing up and touring across California and Texas. I think this movie was also educational, because until the movie, I had never heard of Selena. I guess I wouldn't have because she was mainly known to Latinos on the west coast. Many Latino Americans and her family still mourn to this day about her tragic death. Selena was a talented young woman and was too young to die. Although it was sad, I enjoyed it and would recommend this to anyone that hasn't seen it yet.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie started as she walked out to the stadium in front of millions of fans cheering her on. That left me in confusion at first. As the movie moved on to show her as a little girl and how she became who she was, it, in a way, explained the beginning of the movie. Her life was sad because she worked so hard as a little girl to become one of the nations biggest stars. It benefited her in the last years of her life. Unfortunately as a soon as she was a big star she was murdered by someone close to her. I gave the movie a seven because the movie surprised me at the end and the movie was a good movie.

She could sing great and I think that one of the main reasons that she was able to be as great as she was had to be because her father pushed her no matter how hard he thought it would be. He really thought that Selena could grow up to be a beautiful and powerful young lady. I think that Selena made a great impression on the world while she was here. Everyone loved Selenas music.

		<fullReview>Dazzling, is one word that can describe a great biopic. The first body of the movie, which was Selena's child hood really showed how she grew up, and how she really started the music business. The second and third body of the movie surprisingly kept me interested. With an exceptional conclusion, there's no doubt that Selena deserves two thumbs up. Jennifer Lopez, with her aptitude, her beauty, and her sheer charisma, which flows right out of the screen, there was no dilemma when she was chose to play the part. She was astonishing. Since her biography subject died at a young age, she was able to avoid the problems, inherent in the genre, of trying to age the actress to match the aging of the subject. Every cast member seemed right for their part, and everyone did amazing. The film was well-directed. Overall, the movie was charming, with obvious catastrophic overtones. Highly recommended for all ages.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Selena is a great movie. I liked how the film could relate to people of all ages and races. It showed the life of a woman with passion, heartaches, and success. Being of a multi-racial family, I understand the hard struggle a person must take to be accepted of one race and not the other. Just as Selena's father Abraham, who didn't want to play in Mexico, because of Selena's Mexican Amercian heritage. Selena is fantastic film, but unfortunately, I didn't like the ending. Not to sound too graphic, but I would have wanted to see the conversations and how Yolanda went about killing her. I honestly didn't know who Selena was until I saw the movie. Now that I have seen the movie, I have embarked on passion for the Mexican culture, heritage, and their people, along with their language. I would recommend this movie to everyone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What can i say about 'Selena'? The first time i heard of Selena Quintanilla-Pérez, i was holidaying in America. Living in England I had never heard of the cross over artist named Selena. I decided to watch the movie anyway not expecting too much to be honest but within the first five minutes i was captivated.The movie begins with a young boy band trying to make it in the industry but they are faced with prejudice because they are Mexicans in America. As the movie develops we establish that one of the young boys in the band is Selenas father Abraham, played brilliantly by Edward James Olmos.Although Abraham still yearns for his musical past he now has other priorities such as a wife, three young children and a number of jobs. Abraham is very head strong and determined in any thing he sets out to do and we understand this as we see how he was treated as a young boy.One day Abraham begins strumming on his guitar playing a tune which captivates a young Selena's attention (Rebecca Lee Meza). As she sings along with her father, Abraham realises just how good Selena is, which gives him yet another idea...he will start a band involving all his family.As the story develops we see Selena, her brother and sister being ordered to practice which they do not want to do because they want to play like the other kids but Abraham persists. Along with his band, Abraham also opens his own Mexican restaurant and asks Selena to provide the entertainment.Being Mexican in America and a female, a young Selena was finding it very hard to establish herself as a serious artist. The charts were dominated by male country singers but Abraham never gave up hope. As he tells Selena, he only wants the best for her and finally Selenas mother agrees to give her full support to Abraham. On the beach front, Selenas mother teaches Selena to dance...a dance Selena would later perform on stage to thousands!!! The movie quickly jumps from this point in to Selena as an adult played superbly by Jennifer Lopez who has a remarkable resemblance to Selena. We see Jennifer perform on stage in identical clothing worn by Selena, doing the same dance moves and simply giving it her all in the style of Selena.We also get to see Selena the person, her relationships with her mother, father, brother and sister and most importantly her husband. Chris Perez (Jon Seda) was hired by Abraham to play guitar for Selena on tour and soon a romance began against her fathers wishes. He sacked Chris and this hurt Selena so much she used to sneak off to see Chris alone. They decided in a heat of the moment to get married. Selena knew this would upset her father but she decided to see him and explain but a radio announcement of the shock wedding changes her mind. She does explain to her father the next day who apologises for not letting her make her own choices and accepts Chris in to the family. He also allows Chris back on the Selena tour which begins the next day.Along side this storyline we see Selena branch out in to other projects such as her fashion and beauty business in which she hires Yolanda Saldivar (Lupe Ontiveros) as her financial manager of her fan club. This proves to be a fatal mistake for Selena. As the movie develops, Selena and Chris decide once the tour is over they will start a family and have a farm which has always been a dream for Selena. On top of this Selena has just won a Grammy for her album. Yolando gives Selena a present of a ring she claims she payed for herself but we know she has stolen the money. We realise now that Yolanda is not all she seems and we discover she has been floundering money from Selenas fans. Abraham and Selena confront her and she denies it. She asks Selena to give her time to prove it. Selena allows this and a few days later meets up with Yolando at a motel and the rest they say is history! This meeting proved to be the last for Selena as Yolanda shot the singer in a motel room. Suddenly the movie changes to actual news footage of the reporting of the shooting. Then we follow Selena to the hospital and in a pointant moment, the camera only focuses on Selenas hand and we see shes clutching something...the ring given to her by Yolanda...she drops it to the floor. We see the doctor deliver the news of Selenas death to her family and Chris and as a viewer you get a lump in your throat. The director cleverly mutes the sound so you can not hear the doctor or the crys of Selenas family but you just simply see the emotion and pain in their face and body language.Then the song 'Dreaming Of You' by Selena begins with its dreamy melody and pure lyrics. We see her on stage in a white dress looking like an angel with footage of her fans in a memorial for her, holding pictures and lighting candles in tribute to a wonderful woman.This is a real tear-jerker and Jennifer Lopez gives an excellent portrayal of Selena. I had not heard of Selena but now i do and i can honestly say i will never forget her!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I grew up in Texas and in the early 1990's I was commuting monthly between Austin, Texas and Acapulco, Guerrero, where I now live. I had plenty of road time to listen to Selena, whose "Tex-Mex" music was exactly what I liked best. I looked forward eagerly to this movie, and to the chance to listen to her again.I was very disappointed to hear so little of her music. Most of what is there is partially obscured by crowd noise and covered by costume changes. That, for a woman whose fame was based on her music, is a real shame. Nevertheless, it's a good show and a decent representation of the life of a very talented young woman whose tragic death came far too soon.</fullReview>

I loved Jennifer Lopez playing Selena i thought she portrayed her extremely well.Selena is the true story of Selena the singer and her life until the moment where she dies.Not many people actually realize how good this movie is. It is all so happy because she has everything going for her and her career is just starting to take shape she gets married when her dreams are cut short. Why is it good? My answer:It sends a message to all people to live live the way you want to live it. Also it will show kids in the future just who Selena was and all about her music.I loved the fact that her singing was in the movie and it wasn't Jennifer Lopez because then we can feel the atmosphere that Selena set.If you are to watch this movie all i am going to say is that a box of tissues is a must!</fullReview>

The lip-syncing is perfect, great job Jennifer. The movie's true tale and posture is perfectly done, it's a shame we don't hear much of Nava(film Director). More movies like this should be done. Selena has taught me to never give up on my dreams. I want to become a movie director and my big dream, with the Quintanilla's permission, is that when I grow up and hopefully become a director, I want to redo this great story.I have some great ideas. I believe Selena deserves more than one movie and a whole lot more promotion and DVD extras if and when, hopefully, I redo this wonderful movie. I totally recommend this movie to everyone!

		<fullReview>I just watched this movie in my Spanish class, and I have to say it was an OK movie. Our teacher told us that the movie was so accurate that Selena's dad cried because it was so accurate. I also noticed that Astrodome spoof, because I've been there. It also reminded me of "Raging Bull", because of the montages used during her singing parts and chronicles 35 years, from 1960-1995; except Raging chronicles 20 years, 1940-1960. And plus there were absolutely no boxing scenes in Selena (unfortunetly). Also you could easily tell when young Selena was 'singing', it wasn't her, because you can easily spot where she misses a couple of words while lip synching and her singing voice sounds more like a 25 year old's voice. Also the same song is sung over and over and it gets a little annoying after a while. Overall I give it a 7/10, it sure beats whats on TV tonight.</fullReview>

At times it feels almost epic, at other times like a very good movie-of-the-week (with a large scale budget).It's greatest asset is without a doubt the earnest performance of Edward James Olmos as Selena's father, Abraham Quintanilla, and Jennifer Lopez' who does an impressive re-creation of a much-loved (and sadly missed) legend. A superstar in the US and Mexico many North Americans might find it hard to believe that her tragic death only gained small notices in news-papers here in Europe. Many people hadn't even heard of the great talent! Hopefully this movie will help turn that around as it is one of the best musical biopics to come out of Hollywood in several years.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>what a story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1995, I was 27 and I remember hearing the song 'I could fall in love' by Selena on the radio and I remember someone telling me (an english united states male) that she was a singer, who just starting to make it big and was murdered. I remembered deeply loving the that song, and thinking 'wow' what a voice she had.Well, it's 2003, and since my wife loved J-Lo in the 'Wedding Planner' and the move 'Maid in Manhattan', I picked up this move on sale for 8 bucks at Walmart. I had know nothing about the life of Selena. I had only thought she had made a couple of songs...boy what a surprise. I found a goldmine in her music. Now, I am the proud owner of the Selena DVD of her Last Concert, and a handful of Selena audio CDs.After seeing the movie, I now know Selena had already made it big. I also now wish I would have known about her when she was alive, and experienced the excitement that was happening in Texas in that time.This movie is such a wonderful story, full of wonderful music. J-lo's acting is superb, but most of all the acting of the dad is best. The movie uses Selena's own music/voice, which provides for a 'real' experience.The concert scenes with the large crowds are so moving. It's like being there for real. And Jennifer does a great job of lip synching in the movie(and we all know she's got a lot of practice at that! sorry couldn't resist)And what a beautiful story it is....I am glad to now know the legend Selena.Selena is the Legend and this movie is going to excite people for generations to come.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Incredible Tribute To An Incredible Singer....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was never a big fan of Selena's music, not that I thought it wasn't good, I just don't have any spanish backround or know any spanish, listening to her music seemed odd to me because I did not understand what she was saying. However....when her crossover album came out, I became a huge fan. I enjoyed her music a lot and found it catchy and easy to listen to. It also stayed with you as you were stuck singing it in your head for a while, I believe that was the point. Selena was an amazing and beautiful girl,singer and person. Her life was well lived although it was very short. All the acting was done very well and I don't think anyone else was better to play the role of her than Jennifer Lopez. Jennifer even had some of the same manerismns as Selena, and most probably didn't have to be rehearsed. I loved this movie and thought it was an excellent tribute to her. Unlike some biography movies that aren't done that well, this definitely turns that around. To anyone who loved Selena or just would like to learn about her, go rent or buy this movie. I saw it in one of my classes one day and bought it the following month. I definitley recommend this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A heartfelt movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Selena Quintinella, a Mexican superstar met with an untimely death at the hands of a devious person whom she trusted. This was one of the sad story about a performer that ignited my curiosity to watch the movie. This is poignant movie and I fell in love with it so much so it is part of my VHS collection. Selena played by J-lo a sexy vibrant actress-better than recent crop of Hollywood actresses who are painfully thin and emaciated to the point they are unwatchable. It is amazing how someone can simulate a performer so well like Lopez does in this movie-no wonder she has gone to fame and fortune after this movie. Olmos as Abraham-his interactions with his daughter-in the scene where he confides to her about loosing her, a great piece of acting and direction (Gregory Nava). This is one of the best movies I have seen and God bless the kindred who discount this movie for reasons that are plainly prejudicial.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First, I was skeptical about Jennifer Lopez's big-screen debut as the slain Mexican-American singer Selena Quintanilla. The movie was heartfelt, realistic (Selena did come to life!) and I loved all the characters, especially Abraham Quintanilla (Edward James Olmos), Marcela (Constance Marie) and Chris (Jon Seda), who all contributed to bringing Selena's spirit and music to life. I also give huge props to the Young Selena (Rebecca Lee Meza). The film had me in tears at the end and the storyline was sentimental and sweet, not trashy. A very well-produced, great movie! I don't care if people though that because Jennifer Lopez was Puerto Rican, she shouldn't have been playing a person of Mexican lineage, but she did a wonderful job to bring Selena's music and spirit back to life. I like the fact that Selena's father Abraham was the executive producer of the movie so he could be positive to sustain the dignity and memory of Selena. Viviras Selena!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was so impressed by Jennifer Lopezs Performance in this movie she was really outstanding, she played the role with real heart and it really moved me. She has not done anything like it since or prior to Selena. (I think an Unfinshed life is her oscar bid) Being in the UK i was not really aware of Selena or what happend to her but the film gave me all i needed to know. It gave really good insights into how they lived and what happended i am sure the gritty parts were taken out but that does affect the film As for all those saying that the film showed every Prejudice against Mexican is was only a couple of things at the begining and in the middle at the dress shop the only reason it was shown was because its true and did happen, and people weren't so sad as to only look at people ethnic origins and make judgement about them and whether or not they can or can't afford a dress then it would not have been in the movie. The entire cast did a great job it is sad that her life was ended so soon perhaps she would be bigger then J.lo is now had she still been around. I would highly recomend this as it is a super film and will chnage peoples views on Jennifer Lopez.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had seen this movie a while back. I had never heard of Selena either at the time. But after watching it I was stunned. Jennifer Lopez (played Selena) wasn't as popular as she is now, and I believe this movie helped *in part* to launch her career. I now own the movie and have seen it several times. Its a sweet, serious drama/love story that hits home. Most of us are not a musician and dont have the same things (musically) going on in our lives. But we still can all relate to how she feels and how her family feels throughout the movie. I really liked it and it will remain one of my fav.'s for a very, very long time. -Khrissy</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Since this film was made based on a real-life incident in 1995, I was disappointed that the tragic ending was not dramatized which could have given this film a powerful and meaningful ending and probably an Academy Award nomination for Jennifer Lopez. Instead they chose a two-minute quickie on how Selena died, which you would have missed if you did not hear the mock reporters, since they did not film any scenes of how she actually died. The song "Dreaming Of You" is a beautiful song and it is a shame Selena never got to enjoy the rewards from recording this song nor ever know of her possible success. This song really became a hit after she was killed. Despite the confusing ending, I did shed a few tears.</fullReview>

Edward James Olmos displays his tremendous acting talent as Selena's strong willed father Abraham.And the supporting characters fit together quite nicely. The soundtrack will make you want to go out and get hold of more of Selena's music- she is just that magnetic a performer.

		<fullReview>I notice hardly any real fans of Selena or folks from South Texasweighed in on these reviews. I saw her perform in person, whenshe was just getting famous among Tejanos, and was living inMexico when she died. I didn't follow her career very closely, but Iread enough and enjoyed her music from the moment I heard it.I can testify about the affect Selena had on her true fans in Mexico ylos estados unidos - the movie captures that, which is the point A.Point B is being honest about how she achieved this, and theroles that various family members played, and the movie fleshesout the relationships well. IMO, if that doesn't make it a great movie, it says more about thecultural baggage of the viewer than anything else. It may not beAcademy Award stuff, but its a terrific movie and well worth seeing.And Jennifer Lopez rocks, almost as well as Rebecca...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So many if only's</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am one of those people who hadn't heard of Selena until after her death; and I didn't know too much about Jenifer Lopez until this movie was released. So, I should thank the film makers for introducing me to two spectacular women. I remember seeing interviews with Lopez promoting the movie, and thinking "this woman's going to be HUGE." She's certainly proven her star quality, but unfortunately her talent has not lived up to her work in this film, nor to the talent of Selena. If only Lopez would put the care and heart into her current work that she put into this film.The biggest "if only," of course, is, if only Selena had not been murdered, where would she be now? Probably on the top of the charts. I'd take her brand of pop over Shakira's banal writhing any day. But, let's not forget, Selena was headed for pop music. And those pop music sensibilities cheese up (or down) this movie. It is full of cliches and silly video camera work, and it is really a shame. If only these elements had been properly handled, Lopez really might have been Oscar nominated, a la Sissy Spacek in Coal Miner's Daughter- a film that plays on some stereotypes of a culture, but manages to keep itself out of the cheese tray.But there are stand out scenes that make this movie worth seeing. I get chills everytime I see the opening scene at the Astrodome. I believe that scene alone is enough to establish Lopez as a star and Selena as a (bigger) legend. The choice to downplay murderer Yolanda Saldivar was right on target. Saldivar is given just what she deserves by being shown as a pathetic, crooked, hanger-on, not Selena's "special friend" with whom she would share secrets. To give her any kind of central role in Selena's life would be to justify (in her mind) and glorify her. That's what this kind of crime is about- being remembered as important and connected to a star. Let her rot and be forgotten, and let Selena be remembered for her life, not her death.Also, the fact that Selena's family was so integral in the making of this movie should put to rest all the whining about Lopez's casting, accent, and looks (it isn't about who "looks" like Selena, but who could become Selena); as well as the film's portrayal of Mexican-Americans. And, BTW, this is considered Lopez's breakout role, and it was NOT a TV movie, though it plays endlessly. Also, ignore the reviewer who implied there was "nasty" dialogue in the film. This is as squeaky clean as they come. Definitely worth watching to catch these two stars, and think of your own "if onlys.'"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really didn't know anything about Selena's life, I just barely heard of it on the TV, it said that she was a great singer and that she was murdered by somebody who worked with her. I think this is a very interesting movie, because it tells about her life and unfortunately about her tragic death. I could see it through this movie and thought that it was very sad since she got killed. Selena was a wonderful singer, and I think her dreams came true, she dreamed of being a wonderful singer when she was a little girl. She really achieved it, and I think she should have been proud of herself for being an excellent singer who enjoyed a little of our lives with her music. Great movie, it's worthwhile. Jennifer López was tremendous, what a tremendous actress!, she was perfect as Selena, she should have been an academy award nominee for best actress in leading role for this movie, at least she got the ALMA award for her performance in it. It's worth watching. Enjoy the movie, but I think you will NOT enjoy it at the ending at all because she got killed in a very bad way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Every movie has their Harlingen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gregory Nava is a director who has established himself as being a "Mexican American" writer/director. Therefore some corporate entity thought it would be a good idea to hire him to tell the tragic story of Selena. The movie based on her life is easily one of the most ridiculous and cliched Mexican American films ever made. When I was watching it I couldn't figure out if Gregory Nava was a worst director or writer. The dialogue is absolutely laughable and is nothing that we haven't seen in other movies. The only reason I thought that somebody felt that this movie needed to be made was to cash in on her death before she stops being "bankable". I, as a Mexican American, found the casting of Jennifer Lopez as one of the worst decisions ever made by anyone. I found it very hard to get past her thick New York accent. Gregory Nava is not a Mexican American director and will never be one. He is one of many so called "Mexican American" directors who is guilty of depicting Mexican Americans as flat, one-dimensional character. He stereotypes his characters and tries to make them "cool", but in reality there is nothing that is cool about them. I have no doubt that some of the events in the film really happened, but do they have to be so corny and cliched and unoriginal? But, I guess that's why Gregory Nava is as "popular" as he is. He is making movies that make people feel "good" about things that aren't real. He is guilty of not portraying Mexican Americans as real people and he is trying to manipulate that reality. The one I truly feel sorry for is Selena. I feel sorry about the fact that the last image that people will get to see of her would be of Jennifer Lopez playing her with a thick-ass New York accent. Ridiculous.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A talent lost.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tonight for the first time I learned of Selena Quintanilla Perez. She was the subject of our feature movie. May I say that she was truly a great talent and those with negative comments don't realize how fortunate they really are.Here in Australia, despite immigration, Mexican or Spanish culture doesn't feature greatly in our day to day life. Sure we have citizens of Spanish or Portuguese languages living here but their influence is small. Foreign languages are usually elective and it is almost impossible to find a Spanish restaurant.However, music is an universal language and whether you can speak the language or not does not matter a jot. What matters is if you enjoy good music. I am 56 and like all genre. My only criteria is that it be good music. Unfortunately in Australia we are saddled with mainstream pop and that is it. If we want world music we have to search long and hard for it and still not find it. This is why I had never heard of Tejano music until tonight. You Americans are lucky. You have great talent representing all genres and still you criticize.It does not matter who portrayed this talented young lady. The important message is that her talent was depicted to those ( like myself ) who had never heard of her. It is now my intent to find out as much as I can about this wonderful young woman and purchase some of her music. It seems strange to me but all the truly great artistes' all seem to die young. Its quite ironic.In summation, I can only say I enjoyed the movie without reservation. I accept it for what it was. A story of a beautiful life cut tragically short. If not for this movie I would never have known this lady had existed and for me that would truly have been tragic.10/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Don't get me wrong I have been a HUGE Selena fan since her album Dreaming of You came out shortly after her tragic death, but I think the casting of Jennifer Lopez as Selena was wrong, I had seen soooo many Selena look alikes on a tv special that aired on UNAVISION that looked more like Selena that Jennifer could ever dream of, I don't think it's fair that she got the part and I felt sorry for all the woman who tried out, the fact is Jennifer got the part because she's an experienced actress. Also I think that the murder should have been part of the movie, I know and understand that it wasn't, for respect to her family but I had to sit through this movie in spanish class and most of them had no clue about how Selena died. They knew she had been shot but they didn't know all the details that lead up to her murder, they also had no idea what happened to Yolanda Saldivar after that day. The verdict should have been part of the movie as well instead of wasting a few minutes on flashbacks of when Selena's father was younger and part of a band. I did enjoy the movie but like I said it could have been better. RIP Selena</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Buddy Holly, Janis Joplin, and Selena Quintanilla Perez</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>WARNING: Contains spoilers.Selena's fate continues the sad tradition of Texas music legends meeting tragedy. There have been others. Hank Williams and the Big Bopper for example. But Hank made his own fate and the Big Bopper wasn't quite as big as Buddy, Janis, or Selena. To be sure, this movie didn't dwell on Selena as a tragic figure, it was more of a celebration of her life. But, those who know her story, sense the horror coming. It kind of heightens the sadness.A lot of reviewers have complained that the movie was overly positive and didn't show the dark side of Selena. Well, Selena was an enigma. While she was not the Virgin de Guadalupe, she wasn't a wild child either. She was a goody goody. Her family life was strict and regimented. This was probably the reason for her y los Dinos' ultimate success.The film itself has some laughs and quite a few tears. The audience sees a family that works and plays together. Think about it. The father is the manager, booking agent, bus driver, etc. The mother makes the clothes, supports her kids and is their surrogate teacher. A.B. is the lead musician and peacemaker, while his sister is drummer and best friend to Selena. My point is that this was no easy life. Especially considering how far these gigs are from the family's Corpus Christi home. For example, driving from Corpus to El Paso is like driving from Richmond, Virginia to Canada.This brings up another point. While most of the USA and Canada was inundated solely with pop music a large part of the southwest was taken with an altogether different form of music called Tejano. Tejano is a bit like norteno mixed with polka and germanic rhythms. In real life, even at her young age, Selena appreciated music history and knew her style of music was a type of time capsule waiting to be rediscovered.Rediscovered it was, too. When Tejano and Selena became mainstream here in Texas and North Mexico, the genre enjoyed critical praise. Her grammys and crossover album proved the greatness of Selena. Sadly, even her murder evidences her greatness. In the years since she has been gone, Tejano has regressed in popularity. Where Buddy Holly had proteges to form the Beatles, none has assumed Selena's mantle of authority.The bottom line is that this film does a fine job at portraying a good girl gone good, and tragically cut down by a nut. Jennifer Lopez does so well as Selena that she is almost indistinguishable from the real McCoy. Her father, Abraham Quintanilla is well played by actor Edward James Olmos. The rest of the cast is commendable and no one seems out place. I give this film a strong 8 out of 10 rating.</fullReview>

Selena is no longer here with us but in our hearts she is still alive.Great movie from a great fan of Jennifer Lopez,and Selena I would if I could give this movie 20 stars but I have to live with 10 Stars</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderful But Sad Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I must admit, I was not a fan of Selena or Jennifer Lopez before seeing this movie. After viewing this movie, however, I gained a large bit of respect for them both, especially Selena. This film is as entertaining as it is informative, however the end put me in a real downer. I realize that this is the true story, but I feel the murder could have been downplayed a bit, focusing more on the happiness she did have in her short life. Adding to my grief was real footage of her final concert shown after. Sadness aside, Olmos and Lopez's performances were simply wonderful, and made you really feel as if you had viewed Selena's life first hand. Wonderful movie, but brace yourself for a little depression afterwards.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Oh, she is Selena</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I heard Selena got killed couple years ago, I said to myself that another no name (to me) teen idol signer got into drug or alchoholic problem and got herself killed. I've never heard of her music. I also heard a movie was prepared to give a bio for her, I said to myself "Not again, a crappy movie is gonna shot for this no name singer? Who the hell will watch this movie?!"Recently, I listened to a radio station and heard two songs that I like very much, but just didn't know who the singer was. I thought it was Madonna.Today, TNT is playing this movie and I am busying doing something and just don't have extra hands to tune the TV to other "better" programs. This turns out to be not a mistake. I found the movie is better than I thought. Yes, it tells the life of a singer and it could be boring, but I found it is fun to watch the movie and paying couple of bucks to rent the movie won't be a waste if you haven't seen this movie. Especially when I heard the song "Dream of you" and "Fall in love" then I said to myself "Oh, She is Selena".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a very good answer to the question, "who's Selena?"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When the news reported that Selena Quintanilla was murdered, I wondered, "who was Selena?" The obituary mini-biographies told me almost nothing about her, except that she was fantastically popular as a Tejano singer.The movie was made with the Quintanilla family's backing, so it's no surprise that it portrays Selena very favorably. But there's no hint of scandal in anything I've read about her, and the movie is fairly hard on Abraham, her father, manager, and the movie's executive producer. Maybe she fully deserved the movie's praise.The movie was centered on her childhood and rise to fame. Her murder was just the conclusion to her story. That was a good choice: Told as the story of a musician rising from obscure child star to Grammy winner, but staying close to her family and grateful to her fans, the movie is unusual and interesting. Had it been told as the story of a star betrayed by a trusted associate, or the story of a person shot dead by an estranged friend, it would have been unfortunately ordinary, and less interesting.Jennifer Lopez was amazing. She always seems right as the dutiful daughter who also pays the family's bills with her talent. Even when she's willful, awareness of likely consequences shows in her face. She does a fine job lip-synching the musical pieces too. Finally, her physical resemblance to the real Selena is amazing.The other Selena actress, Rebecca Lee Meza as young Selena, was also very impressive, except for occasional lip-synch lapses. She looks a lot like I'd expect Jennifer Lopez as Selena to look like at a younger age.The movie worked as entertainment, and it worked as a sympathetic biography. I liked the Spanish language music a lot too.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is great for people of all ages. It has sad parts it has happy parts. I liked this movie a lot because I am a fan of Selena's but even if you aren't you would definately like this movie. And maybe even consider of becoming a fan. This movie tells about a young singer who's life is just starting up, when it is cut short by her publicist murdering her. You can really feel the families pain and sorrow for their tragic loss. The father of Selena who I believe co-wrote this film, didn't make the movie all about their hate for Selena's murderer and their pain. But mostly just how much her fans and family cared about her. You could relate to almost everything in this movie, from the family to Selena herself. You will definately remember this film for years to come.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although I enjoy music a great deal, I must admit that prior to seeing the movie 'Selena', I knew almost nothing of her life or death. Allowing for Hollywood's tendency to exaggerate, the story told in this movie is exceptional. If I had to use one word to describe this movie it would be "inspirational."I believe that deep inside we all want the same things for ourselves, but we often lose sight of what it is. Sometimes a person comes along who reminds us of the beauty of the human dream. Selena did that for so many.Gregory Nava's film is simple yet effective. Like the character of Selena herself, there is no subplot or ulterior motives to figure out. Led by their passionate and loving father, the family's ability to find the best in everything takes them to the top. I was convinced by the sincerity of each actor. They did a great job.I see no message in Selena's death. Some lives just last longer than others. And some lives touch us like no others.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So true</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was a wonderful display about this wonderful person's dream and success. I felt as though she was someone I knew, someone I loved. You hear so many stories of these singers and stars that don't care about anybody but themselves, and think that nothing bad can happen to THEM, and then there's someone who is living their dream, not just trying to be rich and famous. You also hear stories about people being murdered, but don't believe it can happen to you or someone you know even though it can. It hurts me to think that a real person who was loved by all, could have such a short life. Nobody, not the richest or poorest person on the planet needs to die like that. We need to all realize that you can never be completely safe, anything bad can happen like that, when you least expect it. This movie helped me realize that. It also helped me to see that Selena was not just a person on TV, or a self-centered celebrity, she was a real human being who cared about everyone and everything, and she accomplished her dream, she became what she dreamed of. She loved all, and was loved by all. To think that someone that you love could even think just for a moment to do something like that to you shatters my heart. Selena, you will always be loved by us, and I mean YOU, not your voice. You have been heard by millions, remembering you fills our heart with joy. We love you, and we always think about you smiling down from heaven with your friends; your brothers and sisters in paradise. Great movie</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tragic story of a singer on the verge of superstardom</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Thought to be the next Gloria Estefan, Selena was a beautiful and gifted young singer who, with the support of her ambitious father and the rest of her family, rose to the top in Latino music. She was about to make the big "crossover" into the mainstream when, at the age of 23, she was shot and killed by the President of her fan club.Jennifer Lopez is Selena, and the story starts before Selena was even born, when her father, Abraham Quintanilla (Edward James Olmos) was in a singing group doing mainstream music at a time when nobody wanted Mexicans unless they were singing Mexican music. Entrepreneurial and always looking to make a better life for his family, Abraham's family put up with him through several ventures, including the formation of a singing group when he realizes that Selena is special. Selena was a family enterprise - they were in her band, her father was her booking agent, and they traveled together in a bus.Selena's voice, performing style, charisma and enthusiasm put her at the top of the Latin charts. She had one other thing going for her - like Elvis, like Jerry Lee Lewis, she was one of the very people she sang to. Their connection to her was very strong.All of this is a build-up to the final few minutes of the film, which are heartbreaking - the real Selena is shown performing and on video with her family, and a candlelight vigil held by her fans is shown as well. What isn't shown is how she died, the assumption being that everyone knows the story. I would have liked a little more background, even just three minutes. All we see is Selena in one scene introducing the President of her fan club. Then later on, there are quick scenes showing the motel where she died, police cars, hospital scenes, and a news report voice-over saying that she went to the motel to obtain financial records and was killed.Even though the viewer knows Selena didn't live, the ending is shocking and sad, as we feel we have gotten to know this young woman, her family, and her dreams. Jennifer Lopez does an excellent job as Selena; Selena's actual singing voice is dubbed. Before Ben Affleck and the paparazzi, which seems to have all calmed down now, there was, and still is, a beautiful, talented actress and performer. Edward James Olmos and the rest of the cast give wonderful performances.This was not a young woman who drank and drove, who did drugs, who was sitting in a parked car in a marginal neighborhood at 5 a.m. and was the victim of a drive-by shooting or a drug deal gone bad. This was a great singer with her whole life ahead of her, a family, a husband and dreams of a baby. That she was struck down so cruelly is sickening.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The movie that put Jennifer on the map!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>And it was a great performance by Miss Lopez. Jennifer once said that following the shooting of this film, she became overwhelmed with the need to fulfill all her own dreams before she died. You can say that she was inspired by the life of Selena, whose life and death story is told within the context of this film. A few years later, Jennifer Lopez was starring with the likes of Jack Nicholson and George Clooney, dating the likes of Sean Combs and Ben Affleck, marrying the likes of Mark Anthony and one of her back up dancers, juggling a singing career with an acting career, hawking her perfumes and clothing line and I guess you can say the rest is history. Mission accomplished, she was plagued by Selena and she has lived out Selena's legacy. Okay, enough about J-lo. This film is about a young and upcoming Tejano singer named Selena who at the peak of her breakthrough stardom was gunned down by the very woman who claimed to be her best friend and president of her fan-club. The story is told in several sequences, showing you the life of Selena as a child, the life of Selena as a teenager and the life of Selena as a 20-something nearing the end of her life. It's hard not to cry when you watch this film. Selena was snatched from us too soon! May her soul rest in perfect peace and may the person who took her from us be haunted by her memory forever. Te Amo Selena!</fullReview>

The reason why was because when I was little I was just like her. I sang not in a band or anything, I played outside all the time with my brother, and how she was always trying to have fun. My favorite part was when they were in corpus on the stairs dancing. About 2 years ago I went to the same spot and visited her grave and memorial.

		<fullReview>Even this movie came out 12 years ago, It could have been better. I believe this movie was low budge ,the special effects were stupid, I mean, they practically use a adult voice whenever the girl (who played Selena as a child) sang or whenever her siblings were playing instruments someone else was really doing it. Also the acting sucked especially the man who played the father of Selena he to me showed no emotion whatsoever and Selena through most of the movie was too ful of herself and was always happy and not showing much emotion like the father. But, of course,I have to give it credit, It was too bad it was pretty funny and it was exciting too. But unfortunately my view overall is that its just too overrated.</fullReview>

Edward Olmos gives an intense performance as Selena's driven dad, although he gets to do some very funny pratfalls early in the film.However, if you're not into Tejana (spelling?) music, this may put you to sleep.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is my first introduction to the music of Selena and, if I wasalready a fan, I think I would be very pleased with the movie. As an"outsider" though I found it somewhat less than gripping.The problem is in the screenplay, which is episodic in the extreme.It's rather like someone flicked through Selena's diary. As a resultthere is no thematic connection between scenes apart fromSelena's career. People and problems just come and go withoutleaving a mark. The biggest example of this is Selena's killer, whopretty much only crops up just in time to do the deed. This kind ofstructure might be okay for a documentary but it doesn't work wellfor a drama. On the other hand, there are some excellent performances fromthe cast, most noticably from Jennifer Lopez who really seems toget into the skin of the character and does some fine lip-syncing toSelena's vocals. In many ways this reminds me of the TV movie "The KarenCarpenter Story", just a little too reverential and sticking closely tothe "official" (i.e. the family) version of the facts. Then again,musical bio-pics have a tendency to be flawed and this is probablyas good as most of them.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I always like days in Spanish class when my teacher is out, because she gives us some movie to watch. It's invariably no good, but it's a good opportunity to do homework for other classes or study. However, when she told us we were going to be watching SELENA the next day, all the girls who'd seen it seemed excited. I know enough not to trust their judgement (these are people who's favorite movies include Napolean Dynamite and Cinderella Story).I was right. I was interested in Selena, the person, when our teacher told us about her. The movie, however, was extremely clichéd. Jennifer Lopez's acting was terribly overdone. The movie held every clichéd scene from movies ever, which I realized from the moment we had a shot of Jennifer staring sadly at a couple kissing, with that look 'oh poor me, I have no one.' What follows is a corny string of scenes such as the "I'm sick of everyone telling me what I want" and the forbidden love with the line "But I love him, Daddy!" J.LO shouted a lot. When rewinding it to find the right place, we played in four times to check; she was crying in three of them.The writing even stooped as low as "We got married and it's okay with everybody!" followed by "I feel like I could fly! I feel like I AM flying".The guy who played Selan's father gave the best performance. The best I can say about J.Lo is she looked gorgeous...so much better then the slutty look she has today. I enjoyed the music in the movie (Which i understand was J.Lo lip-synching to the real Selena) and the end footage of the real Selana was nice. Half the people in my class loved it...that would be the other teenage girls. Not the worst way to spend a day in class, but I wouldn't watch it outside of the classroom.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Back in 1993, I had a roommate who was a devoted Selena fan. I'd never heard of her, but over the next couple of years I heard enough of her (and about her) to get a pretty good idea of what she was about. I even went (with said roommate) to a couple of her shows (she performed often in the area) and had a good time even though I generally can't stand Tejano music and I'm not Hispanic (as most of her audience at that time was). In 1995, like a lot of people who knew who she was, I was saddened by her murder. The story of her life is extraordinarily interesting even if you don't care for her music -- unfortunately, this movie doesn't tell it particularly well. It's too formulaic (rags to riches) and is filled with some unbelievably corny dialogue. The relationship between Selena and Chris Perez (her eventual husband) doesn't come across particularly well since there's very little chemistry between Lopez and Jon Seda, who played Perez in the movie. To her credit, Jennifer Lopez does an incredible job of portraying Selena -- her resemblence (in appearance and in style) to the real Selena is eerie. But other than that, I don't think someone who watches the film without knowing anything about Selena will come away with any real understanding of why so many people were so devastated when she was murdered.</fullReview>

All the other cast members are also superb. My only criticism is why they changed the way she was actually shot?

The movie gives us a generous helping of the Selena songbook, and shows how it developed from her father Abraham's (Edward James Olmos) dreams when he was a young Dion and the Belmonts wannabe in Corpus Christi of the early '60s. Olmos role turns the story into a touching and enchanting family flick.The issue of perceived identity?between Mexican culture and American culture?is a constant throughout the movie and something Selena comes to flow between naturally....For my complete review of this movie and for other movie and book reviews, please visit my site TheCoffeeCoaster.com.Brian Wright Copyright 2007</fullReview>

		<fullReview>No spoilers-just only about a sound. I'd admit when I first saw the movie, I fell asleep near the last quarter of the movie (b/c I had worked all day). I woke near the end due to the sounds of sirens and then rewound it and re-watched. A few months later I watched it again and was hooked. I went out and started buying her CDs. Now I am a big fan! This is an excellent movie to those who want to know about Selena. Some fiction added but that happens in all true movies to "fill in" areas. Shot entirely in the great state of Texas you get a feel of Selena and her life. WATCH THIS!!!! Jennifer Lopez did great portraying Selena and she really looked like her in this! Chris was played by Jon Seda. There are a couple of the Dinos that are in the movie as themselves. I can name a bunch of bloopers and/or changes but I am not here. I would recommend getting the re-released 10 year anny. special of the movie. It is a two disc with the original Selena release and also the movie with some of the deleted scenes. Also on the discs are interviews and other scenes deleted. You will love this and it is a must for all Selena fans!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I Love this movie and I think it is an appropriate portrait of who Selena really was. I grew up in the poor side of Corpus Christi, TX, where the movie was filmed. Selena brought a bright face to the neighborhood of struggling and lower incomed families. She was always there to provide an uplifting word to people. When I was 6 years old she came running out of her house looking for help to find her two dogs. I was one of 6 children that were more than glad to help her with whatever she needed. She was an inspiration because though she made her money she never left the neighborhood from which she came. She was always true to herself and the fans that loved her. I will always and forever miss her. She passed this world when I was only in the 3rd grade but I can remember every second of the day when her life was taken. I was only 8 years old, I lived my life listening to her music and I only felt it was right to leave flowers at her gate because of the wonderful impact she made on this world. So for those people who say they were truly touched by this movie, they will never know how much this entertainer, a true blessing from heaven, had an impact on the lives of the ones who truly loved her.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good flick on Selena's life.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm going to keep my comments short and sweet just like this film on Selena! Kudos to everyone involved. I just watched it and i think it is a feel good film despite the tragic ending, it is extremely girlie...and it is comprised of all little girl fantasies...e.g getting married, being a fashion designer, meeting your 'prince', having your own place! So if you are into chick flicks and just want a laugh then this is definitely a film for you!!! Its light hearted, sweet and musical! Oh and another v v important point... Jennifer Lopez is beyond gorgeous...she is the bomb.</fullReview>

Rest In Peace Selena cause your the angel in the sky looking over us and telling us how to be more like you.The world was blessed when you came into this world and cursed when you left it. If only everyone could be like her.But if everyone was she wouldn't be the special angel she is today and always will be. Now God has our special angel with him probably laughing and having a good time. It will never be the same without her but God knows when he wants his SPECIAL ANGEL back from this horrible world. It just sad how she had to leave.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quite entertaining if you are interested in musical-biography films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film was pretty good. I originally saw it in my second-year Spanish class and thought that it would be bad, but it wasnt. Jennifer Lopez is fantastic at portraying Selena (they both look surprisingly alike) and this film is generally a musical biography. It details Selena's life, how she grew up and became more involved with singing and music under her father's encouragement. They faced hardships at times, such as when they had to move because her father's restaurant went out of business and Selena's popularity was low at first. This was a good story of Selena's life, who was tragically murdered by her fan-club president in 1995 because of a financial dispute.

		<fullReview>Before I watched 'Selena' I knew nothing about the real Selena. After I watched I felt like I knew her a little. That can only mean the movie succeeds in what it was trying to do.I didn't like the first half hour but after Jennifer Lopez kicks in I started to like it more and more. Lopez as Selena does a great job. In the end of the movie we see the real Selena and Jennifer Lopez looks surprisingly much like her. Her performance is very important and the movie works so well mainly because of her. Every other actor does a pretty good job too.In the end the movie is a little slow and a bit too long but it doesn't really matter. The great music, the strong performance from Lopez and the rest of the cast make the beginning and parts from the end easy to forget. 8/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To be honest, I had never even heard of Selena Quintanilla until I saw the VH1 Behind the Music special on her. I was completely blown away - here we have a beautiful Mexican woman with a voice of pure gold, being brutally murdered by one of her 'friends'. After seeing this, I fell in love with the story of Selena. I searched the Net for MP3's and Selena CD's... and found that the story had been made into a movie. But not just any movie. An inspiring, breathtaking look at the life of a Hispanic girl with hopes of becoming a world-famous singer.So, naturally, I ran to the video store and rented it. Another plus - the undeniably sexy Jennifer Lopez as the title role. I couldn't wait to see it once I got home, and that 5 minute wait in the car was more than just worth it.The movie is nothing short of amazing. One of Lopez's greatest performances to date (if not the very best), as she is so much like Selena, and the actress playing Yolanda (the woman who shot Selena) looked identical to the real-life lady she was playing.The music - outstanding, the sets and costumes were fantastic, and the final minute of real Selena footage was great. I've never been the emotional type (I certainly didn't cry during Titanic), but I have to admit that I almost found myself on the verge of tears by the film's end.The cast and crew should feel so proud of the work, and quality of the work that each of them put into this truly wonderful film.Selena's memory will live on forever. - Fantastic, 9/10</fullReview>

Not many people knew who the real life singer was until her tragic death. It is sad to see/hear/read about that but the family of Selena had the courage of bringing her life in film. I am proud of the people who were involved in the film credits. I now know the life of Selena, who I really did not know much of before.

Her tragic ending stuck in my mind for week's. I didn't want that kind of last impression, so I rented the movie to give myself a broader sense of who she was, and what she stood for. Enough of that. This movie portrays her as a person who deserved to make it in the music business. Selena (played by Jennifer Lopez) was excellent and very believable.This movie was definately something that Selena would of been proud of.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sentimental, yet "lightweight"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Selena is just one of those movies that Hispanics want to gain national attention. Not that I'm against it, but I just feel that sometimes they would do anything to gain it... anything.The movie Selena is no exception. I'm Hispanic, first of all, and I never heard about Selena until her tragic demise. I then began listening to her music and I enjoyed it. Too bad I can't see her in anymore new live performances again. As I was saying, the filmmakers did have good intentions of making a potentially good biography of the late Tejana star, but while the movie was sentimental (I almost cried at the end), it didn't have the take-your-breath-away drama like Malcolm X or Dragon: The Bruce Lee Story.This movie, I believe, was intended to insure the American audience that Hispanics aren't lazy or a bunch of gang-bangers that are seen in the movies and elsewhere. Of course Hispanics aren't lazy, but in the movie Selena, the amount of work she put into her music and her success made it look too easy.SPOILER AHEAD!(?) When I saw Selena (Jennifer Lopez) perform in all her tours, it was a sheer joy, a lot to smile about; but behind the scenes, there was not enough emphasis on her struggles nor sufferings that involved her music thus made many critics feel like it was "lightweight". Had it done so, it would have been a smash. But no. There was too much emphasis on the forbidden romance between Chris Perez (now her widower) and Selena, which still makes the stereotype of Latinas-only-wanting-to-marry-their-boyfriends-have-a-family-and-live-happil y-ever-after exist. In fact, Selena and Chris eloped against her father's wishes; some message!!!... for young Latinas.I would give this a 6 or 7 rating because of the mentioned above: Sentimental yet "lightweight". I truly want Hispanics to have a positive image in the media but next time, make it more believable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was in Dallas visiting my son, daughter-in-law and grandchildren when I saw cars down there in the city with messages to Selena written all over them and my daughter-in-law explained to me who she was and what had happened to her. It made me very sad to see all of these young people in mourning and losing someone who had meant so much to them. So needless to say when I heard they were making a movie of her life, I wanted to learn more about her and I feel that the movie told a very realistic story of her life, her family and her music and also what type of person she was. I thank Gregory Nava for doing such a superb job with this movie and letting me get to know her. I grieve for the fans who have lost someone they came to love.</fullReview>

As a fan of mostly classic rock &amp; punk, I never listened to TEJANO music, that was a joke. But now here I am, I have a selena key chain, shirt, the movie, books, CDs,everything. This movie is extraordinary. Even those who never heard of selena, or at least not until she died, will love it. It's touching and most of all, REALISTIC. You feel like you know these people, Selena isn't a "rock star", she's down-to-earth and she works hard to get everything that she does. The movie is true to life and the actors (especially Jennifer Lopez and Abraham) did an exceptional job. Watch this movie! Watch this movie! Watch this movie!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The lives of pop musicians starting in poverty and ending in tragedy have been filmed before; La Bamba and The Buddy Holly Story come to mind. Gregory Nava's script for Selena cleverly tries to tell a bigger tale. It begins with her father's failed music career. The movie quickly shows us the problem for any Hispanic-Latino performer in the United States. White audiences will not accept you because of your race but, Latino audiences expect your songs to be in Spanish. This is the background for the quest of Selena's family to succeed in the music business. Selena's father well played by Edward James Olmos cannot solve this riddle himself but wonders if his children can.Gradually Selena becomes the star and the focus of the film but she is always part of the family business. You wonder is this Selena's or her father's dream that is being fulfilled. This creates great tension but also ends in a bigger payoff in that every success is truly shared.The movie changes to a sweet love story that is nicely done. The concert scenes have plenty of energy. The pace of the film picks up when Lopez as Selena performs with sharp editing and a divided screen giving the film a Woodstock feel. While the acting is fine, Lopez's performance is outstanding. The only weak part was Selena's efforts as a fashion designer which briefly broke the pace of the story. Overall though Selena is a very good film.The tragic ending shifts the movie's style to more of a murder mystery. Why do some celebrities attract people whose worship can turn to lethal anger? That is the final question the film Selena leaves us to ponder.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Melodramatic Bio-Pictures: Selena.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Selena (1997) was just another cheesy, sappy and very melodramatic bio-picture about the short life of Tejano pop star Selena. The director (Gregory Nava who's far from his classic EL NORTE) is just the driver whilst executive producer Abraham Quinetella is clearly the man who's over seeing the entire operation and his heavy handed influence can been found EVERYWHERE!! Selena is granted an unearthly deity status in this film. The film makers wisely choose not to rock the boat and just portray Selena as a virginal goddess like figure who's presence was close to that of a saint.Jennifer Lopez a.k.a. "J-Lo" doesn't even look like Selena and all the heavy make-up and mugging for the camera doesn't help one bit. Ms. Lopez is a mediocre actor at best and she drops the ball when given the chance to shine. If it wasn't for her supporting cast and the younger actress playing Selena so over-the-top, this movie would have been pretty bad. Maybe the producers could have looked a little harder to find an actress who resembles Selena. Selena's husband (Jon Seda) could only mope and act hound dogged into front of the lens. He's part is pretty bad as well. I hope some day they'll be a better film made about the life of Selena. Edward James Olmos was good as the father and Constance Marie was adequate as the mother. Harmless fun for all ages.Recommended for a good time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a young man born and raised in Corpus Christi, Texas; I can relate all to well to Edward James Olmos' comments in the scene in the van where he shouts "We have to be more American than Americans and more Mexican than the Mexicans!" It is all too true in today's society. I joined the Marine Corps and served my country in Iraq and Afgahnistan. Yet, still with the increase of illegal immigration in our country I would constantly receive sneers in certain places. On the other hand, even though me and my girlfriend speak perfect Spanish; we are always teased when we go to Mexico for speaking our "CD ROM learned perfect Castillian".The movie sheds to light so many of the hardships their family faced in trying to make it to the top. The movie doesn't glamorize any of the supporting characters. It shows their flaws and imperfections as we all possess. The scenes showing Selena's budding courtship with Chris Perez are done tastefully and cute. All in all a good flick!</fullReview>

Not that it is a bad depiction of the late pop singer Selena Perez. Far from it. Jennifer Lopez embodies her character very well and makes this film nearly viewable. But there is a problem- the drama is not well thought out so stuff that was made for the screen can be depicted good (a good example of good made up drama is Man on the Moon). So what comes out is a story with no real vital core, just a sad ending (and most people know the ending before the thing ends). Still, it might be worth watching (mainly if you are stuck watching it in Spanish class) if you are a fan or just want to see Lopez embody a character. Edward James Olmos appears as Selena's over-controlling and over-dramatic father. B-</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie did NOT portray the real Selena nor her family. They are very inconsiderate people. Very money hungry. They will literally "hurt" someone for it as well. Being in the tejano business, you know every band (since it is such a small market). I know bands that were involved with the Q Productions, and every band has been burned in one way or another. They did not get any royalties what so ever, contracts were breached, and the list goes on. At a show in Amarillo, Selena refused to sign autographs and her 1 1/2 hour concert turned into 25 mins because the concert hall was only half full. She was not dedicated to her fans, (it was even written in the Amarillo Globe News the day after). The movie really makes her and her family out to be generous and tight-knit. In actuality, A.B and his father do not get along. Lots of curse words thrown at each other(I witnessed it first hand). Poorly made. Made only for the money that would generate.</fullReview>
