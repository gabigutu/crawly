		<shortDescription>Taught, suspenseful thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film has been knocked by many people saying that Orson Welles was forced to work within the strict confines of the Hollywood system. I have absolutely no problem with this. Welles is a master craftsman. He made great films, period. In an interview he said that the studio cut out " a couple of reels" that take place in South America at the beginning of the story that he felt was the best part of the movie. As a viewer I feel that the film is compact and taut. Adding more to it would not help(in my opinion). On the contrary, I think adding more might make the film sluggish. As it stands the film remains dark. You feel that evil is present. You are just not sure what is going to happen next.The performances in this film are for the most part excellent. Edward G. Robinson is amazing. This could have been a cardboard thin good-guy part. Instead he turns the character of Wilson into a smart, cunning hero. He is self-assured not obsessed. He understands what most people in the town don't: Kindler is a monster who is capable of anything. To catch such a man you have to be several steps ahead of him. Also excellent is Konstantin Shayne as Meinike. You can see the fear and madness in his eyes as he repeats "I am travelling for my health, I am travelling for my health..." before going through customs. Make no mistake, this man is "an obscenity that must be destroyed" to quote Wilson. Just look at his scene with the photographer in South America. He is used to people following his orders. Welles is also very good as Kindler/Rankin. There are moments that you actually feel sympathy for him. His obsession with fixing the town clock is very significant. Here is a man who needs things to be precise and structured. He wants total control of his environment(a good example is how he treats his wife). Welles hints at this man's mania but keeps him human. Even though you want him to be caught, you can't help wondering if he'll get away. Loretta Young is unfortunately just average in this film. She has some good moments (especially in the final scene when she confronts Rankin/Kindler)but her hysterics are just too much. The scene where Wilson is showing her the Nazi atrocities is well played. She keeps a certain composure that works well.Overall, a very well made thriller with top notch performances and solid direction by one of cinema's masters. I give it 8 clock towers out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fascinating Thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Stranger was directed by Orson Welles but he did not adapt it to the screen. Although this is seen as a detraction from the whole by some who have seen it, I believe that Welles' deft directing and penetrating acting is what makes this a Welles film for my taste. He was never a facile actor - but he uses his usual wooden countenance here to the advantage of this role.Another thing that fascinates me is the underrated status of this engrossing thriller. The action and suspense builds and builds to a peak of excitement that few movies can reach without lots of special effects and Foley work these days. This movie fascinates at every turn without ever seeming as if we are watching art. But art it was in Welles' direction and gentle handling of the unravelling.Edward G. Robinson is the subtle but welcome prize we receive from this outing. The undercurrents of the horrors that have just come before this movie was made and its actions can be seen seething within his duty to find hidden Nazis. He is methodical and intelligent, it so difficult to see the difference between Robinson the man and Robinson the actor here. He is such a talent that we often mistake his ease for something else but acting -- and of acting he was a master. Plainly seen here as a gift to all of us.What I like about this and many other good films is how facts are revealed slowly, layer by layer. Loretta Young was good as the innocent young girl who believes that marriage is a sacred institution, that life has a course to follow which will not be derailed and finds it hard to accept the truth of the horrors behind her marriage.It was mildly amusing to see a very young Richard Long as the open-minded young man with whom Robinson's character confides certain facts.I recommend it to fans of psychological thrillers, mysteries and of course, of Mr. Orson Welles. So sad that the studio heads were such disingenuous towards this utter genius of a man who deserved more earnest accolades in his life.THE STRANGER is not glittering masterpiece but it's a hell of great story that I do not tire of watching...and seeing each piece of the puzzle fall into place.What MORE could an intelligent person want from a movie?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Vastly underrated Welles - one of his best films, one of the best thrillers ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Stranger is a little slow to start. Edward G. Robinson, playing a war crimes detective named Wilson, lets loose one of the right-hand men of an important Nazi war criminal named Franz Kindler (Orson Welles) who escaped prison and managed to erase his identity. He was the mastermind behind the concentration camps. No photographs exist of him, and only this goon might know where he is. Wilson tracks the goon to a small town in Connecticut, where Franz Kindler is posing as a history professor about to marry the daughter of an important politician. Immediately the goon disappears, but the professor arouses Wilson's suspicion.After the setup is over, The Stranger bolts ahead at a breathless pace. All the clues point to the professor, though there is nothing definitive. When his wife, Mary, finds out (played by Loretta Young), she refuses to believe it. Kindler feeds her a nice lie explaining everything, and she's desperate to believe it. He's not sure that he can trust her.Welles pulls a ton of suspense out of the situation. He's so good at creating points of tension out of both the simplest means, like a group of college boys on a paper chase, a dog who won't stop digging in the leaves, or something much more gothic, like the ancient, broken-down clock in the church tower. Kindler was an expert on clocks (which is one of the biggest clues), and when he revives this old monster, an iron angel with a sword chases away the devil and then rings the bell to the hour. To get to the top of the tower, an extraordinarily tall ladder must be climbed. This leads to as much or more suspense as existed in the cognate scenes in Hitchcock's Vertigo. In fact, I'm sure Hitchcock watched and liked this film. Everyone knows he admired Welles' later Touch of Evil, which he mimicked in his own Psycho, so why not this film?The acting is quite brilliant as well. We would expect it from Orson Welles, of course. This is actually one of his very best roles. He is amazing at telling believable lies to his wife and friends, but with the dramatic irony in which the audience is in possession, we see the depth and the nervousness and the evil. Edward G. Robinson has a pretty thankless role for a long time, but nearer the end he begins to expand. We cringe when he coldly suggests that Mary is in mortal danger. He is simply great in the climactic scene (which I won't mention except to say that it is one of the best in film history, although some might find it a bit silly). Loretta Young is also great as a naive wife who so desperately wants to be the perfect wife and believe everything her husband says. If this movie were to be remade today, her character would have been developed further psychologically, but what is here is good. She is also great in the climactic sequence.Welles' films often have thriller elements, but this is his most thrilling. It's also probably his least philosophical, and almost certainly his most conventional. He made the film as a concession. I think he was allowed to make The Lady of Shanghai in return, which is an even better film than this. That is no matter, though. It's a masterpiece anyway. 10/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I picked up this movie, mostly because of the cover and the price ($4). I was happily surprised as to the quality of the movie.The story takes place after the end of World War II. Edward G. Robinson plays a government official named Mr. Wilson. He is in charge of the Allied War Crime commission. He is looking for an elusive war criminal. His name is Franz Kindler (Orson Welles). He is suppose to be the one who came up with the Nazi plan of mass annihilation. There is no evidence, nor any photographs of Kindler. To find Franz, Wilson releases Kindler's assistant (Konrad). Konrad inadvertently leads Wilson to Harper, Connecticut. Kindler is hiding out at an all boys school as a professor named Charles Rankin. Konrad arrives on Charles' wedding day. He is getting married to the daughter of a liberal Supreme Court justice.This movie is definitely film noir, in the lighting and the grittiness of the events. It is also quite evident that this movie was directed by Welles himself. If you have seen any one of his movies, you can see how he functions. The story is enjoyable, if not slightly predictable (especially if you have seen other film noir films or have listened to any golden age radio programs). Overall, it is nice to see Edward G. Robinson playing the good guy for a change. I also thought Billy House had a standout performance as Mr. Potter (the owner of the local general store). He provides most of the comedy relief. I highly recommend this movie for fans of Edward G. Robinson, Welles or the film noir genre.-Celluloid Rehab</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Thriller With Welles, Robinson, &amp; More</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's quite interesting to see two acting legends like Orson Welles and Edward G. Robinson working together, and with a cast that includes those two plus Loretta Young, along with an interesting story, "The Stranger" is a pretty good thriller.Welles and Robinson play an interesting cat-and-mouse game in the search for a former Nazi who is hiding out in a peaceful Connecticut town. It's fair to point out, as others have done, that the dialogue at times leaves a little to be desired, but Welles and Robinson have more than enough ability to carry it off anyway.Loretta Young has a difficult role as the wife of Welles's character. The script does her no favors, either, but she gives a creditable performance as a character who is important to the story. Among the supporting cast, Billy House particularly stands out, getting surprisingly good mileage out of his role as the store-keeper.Perhaps the most creative aspect of the movie is the effective use of the clock tower, both as a plot device and as an idea, along with the related themes of clocks and time. The tense climax makes good use of all of these elements.Welles and Robinson were both parts of so many outstanding movies that sometimes their merely good movies can seem to suffer by comparison. As long as you don't try to compare "The Stranger" with some other film, but just watch it for itself, it's a good thriller and an entertaining movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>On the dangers of Clock Towers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Peter Cowie's THE CINEMA OF ORSON WELLES does not say much in favor of this film. He felt it was a minor work, and in a sense it is. Welles, having failed in Hollywood terms to produce a blockbuster box office success with KANE, AMBERSONS, and IT'S ALL TRUE, had demonstrated more success as a film actor (JANE EYRE in the 1940s) than as a director. He wanted to show he was able to create a successful film at the box office, and so he agreed to direct this small thriller. But it lacks the depth of the major films of his career, and so Cowie is correct to label it minor. That does not mean it isn't interesting. Welles was the one of the first directors to tackle the issue of missing Nazi war criminals. The same year as THE STRANGER Hitchcock was filming NOTORIOUS and Charles Vidor did GILDA. All three tackled the plight of fleeing Nazis. NOTORIOUS is about Nazi and Nazi sympathizers led by Claude Rains (as Alex Sebastian) in Rio De Janairo, who are plotting some deviltry involving uranium (Hitch's "MacGuffin"). GILDA's complicated plot deals with George Macready (as Balin Munsen) double crossing German industrialists who trusted him with contracts and papers giving the owner title to their tungsten interests in Argentina. THE STRANGER deals with the search by Wilson, a government agent, for one Franz Kindler, a leading Nazi, who has fled first to Latin America, and then to the United States. It turns out that the devious and clever Kindler has wormed his way into a marriage to the daughter of U.S. Supreme Court Justice Longstreet. In each case, as you see, the fact that the Reich has fallen does not mean the danger is over - the Nazis are planning a come-back.It has been noted that Welles based Kindler on the character of Martin Bormann, the missing deputy to Hitler and leading adviser in his inner circle. Bormann had back stabbed his way to power at the expense of his predecessor Rudolf Hess. Hess had been showing signs of cracking up by 1941(that Bormann fully took advantage of) and then flew to England in a mad attempt to settle the war there before the invasion of Russia. However, Bormann (unlike Kindler) was not the creator of the "final solution" in the movie - that was Bormann's rival Reinhard Heydrich. Heydrich had been assassinated in 1942, so he was dead and buried years before the war's end and the Nuremburg Trials (where Bormann was found guilty and condemned to death in absentia). I might add another missing Nazi leader is in everyone's mind - Welles has Konrad Meinike (Kindler's assistant) tell people he is on a mission from "the all highest". The deranged Meinike means God, but everyone (including Kindler) thinks he means the seemingly indestructible and missing Adolf Hitler. Details from Soviet archives proving Hitler's suicide were not published until the 1980s.The film follows the efforts of Wilson in tracking down the missing Kindler. He allows Meinike to get out of prison (he was facing a death sentence) to follow him. Meinike does lead Wilson through Latin America to a town in Connecticut where Kindler is hiding as Charles Rankin, a history teacher in a prep school (where the sons of the nation's elite are groomed for their paths to leadership). Although it is barely commented on in the movie, Kindler/Rankin is in a lovely position to influence the future leaders of the country - to indoctrinate them into neo-Nazis theories. He is laying a groundwork to protect himself, but to continue the Nazi theories. In one scene he mentions the need to destroy the Germans because of their habitual warlike natures. But he retains a dislike of Jews (in the scene mentioned above, he insists Karl Marx is a Jew not a German).The film has been cut by nearly half an hour. This was the start of the film which dealt with Meinike's "escape" and his journey (followed by Wilson) to and through Latin America. We see the conclusion, when he confronts a photographer who knows where Kindler is hiding. But the missing footage would have been very good to watch - it was a double build up to revealing that the evil Kindler was still alive, but also to lead to the irony of the insane Meinike's seeking out his missing boss to convert him to Christianity, only to be murdered by him. The sequence of the killing of Meinike is a great set piece, and one wishes the missing footage were still available because it would be a fine, ironic conclusion. One can here, as in the slashed up AMBERSONS, see what Welles' concept was meant to be, and what the audience was left with.The individual portions of the film are quite good, in particular the bits with Billy House as Mr. Potter, and the paper chase sequence. The finale is good too. Kindler is a fanatic about clocks, repairing them whenever he needs recreation. The town's Gothic church has a broken medieval clock with figures. Kindler manages to repair it so the figures move. In the end of the film he is hiding in the tower, and comments on watching the townspeople searching for him - they look like ants to him, as he feels like God (his conversation here sounds very like that of Welles' signature bad guy role, Harry Lime in THE THIRD MAN made four years later - Lime also looks at the "ants" from the ferris wheel in Vienna). When confronted by Mary Longstreet Rankin (Charles bewildered and angry wife played by Loretta Young) and Wilson, Rankin gets killed by the clock figures. It was to be expected, and it is one bang - up conclusion to the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Orson welles directs and stars in vivid postwar Nazi hunt.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A little much in parts, particularly the use of headlight direction that Welles loves to employ, nevertheless, this is a film that rates three stars in the Wellesian collection.Edward G. Robinson is superb as the laid-back, all-knowing, in-your-face detective and Loretta Young scores as Orson's wife but it's big Billy House who is the real scene-stealer. House plays the man who owns the self-service store in town who likes playing checkers with his customers.Welles, who looks a little strange--no doubt to match up with the title-provides a commanding performance throughout in a film that reflects the era's revulsion with the Nazi dream.</fullReview>

Could he be in this perfect American town?. Welles is undercover as a local professor. He marries Mary Longstreet (Loretta Young) but soon some terrible things start occurring in Harper. Mary's dog, Red is missing. Then the body of a mysterious foreigner is found in the woods.The clock plays a backdrop; Franz Kindler is an amateur clock collector. There are several intriguing scenes, such as when Welles is discussing Nazis and warfare, in the context of history. This is a brilliant suspense film. 10/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Start with an inviting, wish-I-were-there small town setting. Then, toss in the most horrendous and heinous kind of evil, creating ripples in the placid pond. Watch as the ripples and their reflections move across the waters. Add the acting talents of three of the truly great performers of the 20th century, Loretta Young, Edward G. Robinson, and Orson Welles, and direction worthy of Hitchcock at his peak. Top it all off with a supporting cast that never misses a beat. That is what you have here. The Stranger may not be the perfect film, but if you like the sense of films like Hitchcock's "Shadow of a Doubt," you'll probably enjoy this. Personally, I have found it more engrossing every time I view it. Even though the mystery is gone, the great performances and pacing really are amazing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The clock tower</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Any Orson Welles film is worth taking a look. It will surprise the viewer in many ways because of Mr Wells' keen sense of cinematic eye. The only thing bad with this movie is the fact that Orson Welles didn't adapt it for the screen. As a result, it suffers in many logical aspects, but doesn't detract from the over all enjoyment of the movie. Mr. Welles' legacy is a treasure for the movie loving public. He was indeed a man ahead of his time. "The Stranger" wasn't one of his best films, but it has its rewards in the great cinematography, the acting by the magnificent cast assembled for this picture. From the beginning we get to know who the real bad guy is. The story builds suspense as it goes along. The film is never boring and doesn't feel outdated at all. The last scenes at the clock tower are pure Welles. The interior of the clock tower scenes couldn't have been conceived by no other than Mr. Welles himself. The ending is amazing, to say the least.Loretta Young, as Mary, the young bride is perfect for the part. Edward G. Robinson plays the war criminal hunter, Mr. Wilson. He is always effective, no matter what film he is in. Mr. Welles, is very intense as Dr. Rankin. Even the minor roles played by Billy House, Richard Long and Martha Wentworth are perfectly conceived and acted.For fans of Orson Welles to enjoy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As Dark as Noir Gets</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No question about it, "The Stranger" is film noir. This oppressive narrative is shrouded in what must surely be among the darkest visual styles ever. Outdoor, sunlit scenes are few and far between. Most of the picture takes place inside the shadowy mansion of Loretta Young's guardian, inside the town's general store, or within the nearly pitch-black church steeple, where the film climaxes in a highly dramatic manner. This movie is noir, without a doubt.Orson Welles, Edward G. Robinson and Loretta Young--are all beyond criticism as well, giving finely tuned, subtle performance. Also standing out is a very young, understated Richard Long--proving he had acting chops way back then. Bronislau Kaper contributes a score to rival other, more highly-regarded composers. There are moments in it of ethereal beauty as well as intense drama.Yet, apart from its visual style, how is "The Stranger" noir? The answer may lie in another question: who is the hero? If it's the Welles character, then he is an anti-hero and it fits pretty well. However, his new wife, played by Loretta Young, finds herself in a situation most noir, when Welles confesses the murder to her (and later plots her death as well). But Young does not seem like the main character in this tale, nor does Robinson, who is clearly a heroic figure. Perhaps what makes this one noir is the visual style in combination with character situations that complement each other."The Stranger" is only a few short steps below "Touch of Evil" in the Welles pantheon.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Orson Welles although he had to give in to studio demands in terms of casting still managed to direct himself and the rest of his players into a pretty good man hunt thriller in The Stranger. The cast change was to put Edward G. Robinson in the role of the hunter of fugitive Nazi Franz Kindler played by Welles. Originally Welles wanted one of his Mercury Theater players Agnes Moorehead in the part. At that time it would have been quite a blow for feminism and probably would have made The Stranger a feminist landmark. As it is Edward G. Robinson brings his own truth and conviction to the role.Orson Welles is the fugitive Kindler who is modeled upon the then at large Martin Bormann. We never learned that Bormann had in fact been killed by the Russians who just never bothered to tell us until the early seventies. Bormann in his time was the most wanted man at least in the capitalist world. Bormann did not originate the 'final solution' mass extermination policy for Jews and other undesirables, but like Kindler in the film and unlike some of the others of Hitler's gang, he did have a passion for anonymity. It made hunting for him that much the harder.Another one of the Nazi small fry Konstantin Shayne is allowed to escape jail and the hangman in the hopes that he'll lead the authorities to Welles. Shayne performs on schedule and Welles is forced to kill him in order to keep his his new identity as a teacher at an exclusive prep school for America's WASP elite. Welles has also married Loretta Young, the daughter of a U.S. Supreme Court Justice to make his entry into the elite complete. Robinson had lost Shayne's trail before he was killed, but knows his man is in that small New England town. Robinson settles down in the town posing as an antique dealer and fishes for information as to who his prey is posing as.Welles got a very good performance out of Loretta Young in the same year she won her Oscar for The Farmer's Daughter. It does slowly dawn on her, but she refuses to believe the man she married only married her for a respectable identity. Her slow realization is what makes her performance a good one.Others noteworthy in the cast are a young Richard Long as Young's brother who Robinson takes into his confidence early and Billy House as the storekeeper/checkers hustler. You can see traces of Welles's technique from such earlier work like Citizen Kane. One of my favorite shots, reminiscent of the deep focus cinematography of Citizen Kane is when Welles is in House's store playing checkers. He's got a hobby, clocks, that is one key to his identity. He is fixing a clock tower in the town square and loosens the peg on a ladder needed to get to the clock. It was meant for Young who was supposed fall and break her neck, but Robinson discovers it. As Welles is playing checkers with House, you can see the tower between the two men through the window of House's store. Then the camera moves in closer as Welles's voice keeps talking at about the time he figured Young would be falling from the ladder. It was setting a careful alibi for a crime that had been foiled, but of course Welles doesn't know that yet. Pure Citizen Kane.The Stranger doesn't compare either to Citizen Kane, but it's still a much better than average noir thriller. And the ending is really outstanding. The sword of justice does indeed find its mark.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hard to believe Welles directed this awful movie...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm finding that I'm quite at odds with many reviewers concerning "The Stranger." They and I obviously live in different worlds."The Stranger" is one of the clumsiest, most obvious, most absurd movies I have ever seen -- which is made even worse by the fact that Orson Welles not only starred in it but directed it, too. This movie demands that the viewer suspend all disbelief and swallow the supposition that an extremely prominent Nazi war criminal -- who hasn't a trace of a German accent -- can somehow escape Germany, obliterate practically all evidence of his past, and get hired as a Connecticut prep school instructor, mere months after the end of the war.There are no surprises in this movie whatsoever; we learn almost at the beginning who the bad guys and the good guys are, and we can see every plot development coming a mile away. You will marvel at the lax investigating and policing procedures, the overwrought scenery chewing of Loretta Young, and the gullibility of many of the characters, not to mention Welles's condescending portrayal of the excessively stereotypical "village folk" who populate the background of this movie.In 1946, Bosley Crowther hit the nail on the head in his review in the New York Times: "He is just Mr. Welles, a young actor, doing a boyishly bad acting job in a role which is highly incredible?another weak feature of the film."I give this movie a 3 out of 10 because of its entertainment value -- that is, like "Plan Nine From Outer Space," it's so bad, it's fun to watch. The noir cinematography is tricky, although quite extreme and self-conscious, and the film has value as a period piece with lots of local color that makes it a travelogue into the past.Otherwise -- hold your noses!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Stylish Noir Thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having recently watched (finally!) this noir classic, I'm compelled to encourage others to do the same. It's a pleasure to see a work of art like this film which displays skillful attention to detail in every frame. I know there are those who would argue that this is a hack piece for the great Welles, but the stylish look of it is beautiful, and while there may be a few plot flaws, who cares? There's murder, political intrigue, suspense, a little gore and a wronged woman not to mention a few cutesy down-home characters to boot. What more d'ya want from a thriller?Mr. Welles functions impressively in his dual capacity as director while acting the title role (a character who is also playing a dual role come to think of it), giving a nuanced performance as escaped Nazi-in-hiding, Franz Kindler, mastermind of the genocidal Final Solution, all the while applying his directorial genius to the piece. Edward G. Robinson is wonderfully restrained as the infinitely patient and unflappable Mr. Wilson, a G-man devoted to his job of hunting down and delivering WWII criminals to justice. Viewers are led along with Mr. Wilson to find the evil Herr Kindler living incognito in a small town in New England, having insinuated himself into the lives of the unsuspecting townsfolk, most notably, the beautiful and sweet but none too bright, Mary, played by Loretta Young. Imagine this fiend lurking in an idyllic Connecticut hamlet, waiting for the day when the Reich will rise again, while in the meantime having the brass to enhance his cover by marrying the innocent young daughter of a Supreme Court Justice! The centerpiece of the town and the film is the clock tower at the Harper School for Boys, where Kindler has assumed the guise of Professor Charles Rankin. The clock tower offers a thrilling cinematic focus as we often find ourselves in and around it, never venturing far from it, beginning with the first moment when we see it on a picture postcard, right up to the exciting conclusion when the clock itself takes on an integral anthropomorphic role in the administration of justice. Of course the image of the clock tower and its dizzying visual and symbolic possibilities has since been employed in different ways by many a filmmaker, from Hitchcock on down, though not often on a par with Welles' diabolical vision. OK, maybe not Citizen Kane, maybe not Orson Welles' proudest moment, but GREAT STUFF.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gripping, engrossing piece of film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first watched "The Stranger" on a cold Saturday night. It was pitch black outside, a fitting setting in which to watch this chilling film.The story unfolds like an onion, with the facts slowly revealed as the skin is peeled away. We learn that a Nazi criminal,Meinike,will be allowed to escape from prison. It is only when he visits fellow comrade Kindler that we understand why. Kindler was the worst of the Nazi war criminals, as he was the creator of the death camps and all of their savage technology. He kills his friend to escape suspicion, but ironically, the discovery of Meinike's body only furthers the tarnishing of his reputation. Each act of violence Kindler commits drives him farther to the edge of his sanity...or insanity, depending on your point of view. He can only find solace in tinkering with the town clock. It's as though through fixing the clock, he can fix parts of his life as well. He needs order. When he realizes he cannot have it, he attacks the grandfather clock. It's as though the one stable thing in his life is gone. Also, remember how the clock is whirling at the beginning of the movie? It whirls at the end as well. It gives the film closure, and also shows how the entire situation in the town was broken while Kindler was there. A fascinating film, "The Stranger" will be on your mind long after the credits have scrolled down the screen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another great day at the office for Orson Welles.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Stranger is one of Welles' lesser known works but it is right up there with the best, which means pretty much all of 'em! What is a fairly simple story is given the full treatment.The cinematography is wonderful-why can't directors use black and white these days?, they just don't have the eye for it anymore.It is sometimes said that Welles' started at the top and then everything went downhill.I don't agree.The Stranger, Journey Into Fear, Lady From Shanghai,The Trial,Touch Of Evil etc,etc every one a great film. Given that this was made cheaply as a B movie,it blows so many 'great' movies out of the water.Welles never got within sniffing distance of an Oscar for any of his work, the Hollywood mafia saw to that, but when you think that Titanic scooped the pool it fair makes you weep. Still, some of us know and some of us don't.You don't need to be a movie buff to watch The Stranger, you just need to be unindoctrinated by the Hollywood factory.Watch and enjoy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Strange</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers herein.Orson Welles was a visionary mystic who was often coerced into blunt activity by dull men. This is such a case: Orson toeing the line in order to build cash for projects he cared about (at this time, it would have been the amazing `Othello'). Earlier in his theater career, he did similar slumming in the radio world. He was effective as, say, The Shadow, but not inspired. And when anyone who is so blessed with talent is forced to hide it the project can be called a disaster no matter how apparently palatable it is.So I can say that this is a crying disaster. I watched it several times looking for the master's subversion. After all, Welles was a stranger in Hollywood, at this point trying to blend in -- literally by marrying a `local' beauty. He was extremely bright, and all that brilliance was tuned to its own suppression. So one would expected some secret signs distributed throughout that conflate him as actor with his character. Alas, there is not even a spark of that.The 2 part DVD (with `The Trial') has a particularly useless commentary.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 4: Has some interesting elements.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Atmospheric, but surprisingly superficial post-war Wellesian melodrama that simply lacks a convincing story line.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A particular disappointment for those who recognize Orson Welles as a film innovator and genius. Despite many critic's belief that "The Stranger" is a minor masterpiece, the truth is that it's little more than a convoluted piece of propaganda intended to assuage the feelings of post-war audiences. On the plus side, director Welles does manage to show a stylish touch here and there, and the stark black-and-white photography evokes a somber and appropriately eerie pall over the proceedings. But nothing can overcome the banal, increasingly preposterous story line which, by some miracle, received an Oscar nomination.Top-billed Edward G. Robinson plays a federal agent who has assigned himself the task of finding a heinous, sought-after Nazi war criminal who played a principal role in the operation of concentration camps. By cleverly allowing the "escape" of a minor Nazi figure, Robinson hopes that Nazi minor will lead him to the whereabouts of Nazi major. As the action unfolds, the trail quickly leads to a quaint, quiet, seemingly unaffected Connecticut town.Welles' batting average at this point of his film career was poor. He had struck out profitably with his prior three movies, but producer Sam Spiegel gave Welles this final opportunity to prove he COULD churn out a movie on time and within the budget. For Welles the result was remunerative and commercially successful. But at such a cost! While the studio was appreciative, Welles himself called it the worst film of his career and I couldn't agree more. It probably succeeded because the film's content struck a politically correct chord with its 1946 post-war audiences. I can think of no other reason.Accenting this suspense melodrama with shadowy camera angles and wonderful "portrait-like" close-ups of his stars, Welles shows surprisingly little of the inventiveness he is known for. Everything seems rehashed, including a strikingly reminiscent clock tower finale a la Alfred Hitchcock. Moreover, Welles dilutes most of the film's suspense with stale, ineptly drawn, poorly motivated characters -- most of them sacked with implausible dialogue and situations. Even the musical score is obtrusive and obvious.Wisely understated, Robinson comes off best here as the dogged agent whose instincts do not fail him as he ferrets out his suspect. His character's tone seems balanced, direct, and realistic, which is truly welcomed for he is surrounded by a cast of over-emoters.Welles the director comes off marginally better than Welles the actor. He plays the small-town professor-turned-suspect as if he were Macbeth in a production of "Our Town." His classical demeanor just doesn't jell. At least his Nazi isn't a caricature, but his intense, incessant brooding here quickly turns mechanical, registering every sinister act and intention with a wide, fixated, stony gaze. One of his few good moments occurs at a dinner table sequence when he is allowed to expound on everything from Marxism to the mental restoration of post-war Germans. Loretta Young is the chief violator of most of the film's acting problems. As the unsuspecting wife of Welles' character who refuses to see the obvious, she is simply unconvincing in her many scenes, unleashing a plethora of emotions, none of them coming from anywhere real. Her reactions are over-baked and, at times, unintentionally amusing as she feigns shock, disbelief, false bravado, and everything else under the sun. The dialogue served on her certainly doesn't help either. But the most frustrating aspect of this film is that Welles, in order to advance the plot, allows his characters to do such silly, unsubtle, nimble-minded things. Neither Robinson's methods of tracking down his man nor Welles' ability to elude the ever tightening dragnet are done with much intelligence. One wonders how they ever achieved their stations in life. And poor Loretta! She is practically offered up as a sacrificial lamb just to expose her husband's true identity, when other methods could have utilized just as well! While "The Stranger" cannot seriously damage Orson Welles' reputation as a masterful but frustrated filmmaker, it certainly does nothing to enhance it. </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Disappointing Considering The Three Leads</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Since the three stars of this movie are three of my favorites - Orson Welles, Edward G. Robinson and Loretta Young - this was a major disappointment. This is one of the few movies I didn't care for but watched THREE times. I guess I really, really wanted to like this film, although the final time I only watched it because it was part of a film noir DVD package set. At least the print was better than the lousy VHS copies that were available on this movie. That's important because, being a film noir, there a number of good night-time shots with sharp contrasts.I might have thought better of this film had it had a more realistic ending, instead of hokey Hollywood-type finish that has a major credibility problem, which I can't go into with spoiling it. It also had too many lulls in the story. They weren't long lulls, but they added up.Despite the story problems, it's always a pleasure to see Robinson - in his prime, too, a thin Wells also in his good years and attractive Young. Too bad their characters are on the dumb side, as is the story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Overwrought and melodramatic ending for an uneven film...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THE STRANGER offers an interesting story, but it takes its time in involving the viewer in it after a slow start. ORSON WELLES is an ex-Nazi hiding in a small Connecticut town and EDWARD G. ROBINSON is the man hunting him down. Loretta Young is his attractive wife who knows nothing about her husband's past.These elements are combined to make a fairly suspenseful story under Orson Welle's rather theatrical direction. He gives one of his robust over-the-top performances in the peak melodramatic moments, such as the final scenes where he follows his distraught wife to the clock tower, an ending foreshadowed by his fascination with clocks.Seen in a pristine print, it's a very watchable movie. Unfortunately, there are many Public Domain prints that make the film look like a low-budget production. Avoid them if you can, and you should get some suspenseful entertainment from a good print.Performances by Loretta Young and Edward G. Robinson are excellent.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Welles's least favorite and least personal film is one of his most enjoyable; an exciting film noir with an excellent performance from Edward G. Robinson</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The IMDb trivia page says this is Orson Welles's least favorite and least personal film. Aside from "Citizen Kane" and "The Magnificent Ambersons," I think this potent film noir is his most enjoyable?certainly more so than the ugly "Lady from Shanghai" or the overbaked and convoluted "Touch of Evil."Charles Rankin (Orson Welles) is a professor in a respectable Connecticut town about to marry the daughter of a U.S. Supreme Court justice. But his name is fake and his past is filthy. An earnest convert to Christianity (Konstantin Shayne), who once ran a Nazi concentration camp, is capable of exposing him. "Rankin" kills this little old man and buries his body in the forest. But he isn't safe because an investigator (Edward G. Robinson) from the War Crimes Commission is on his tail. Rankin needs his own wife (Loretta Young) to help him elude capture. But his fascination with the local clock tower may prove his undoing.As a director, Welles strains a bit too hard for effect in this film?and much too hard in everything but "Kane" and "Ambersons." In those two films all of his technical effects, striking as they are, seem effortless and exactly the right choices. Here, he has imperfect moments?such as the scene where his character is frantically, and inexplicably, trying to pick up pieces of paper?but everything else is splendid, especially the climax.As an actor he's always compelling, but I think he makes one bad choice here. He's too guilty-looking in the early scenes. It makes us wonder why no one suspects him; and it robs us of a dramatic contrast when he begins to realize he's in imminent danger.Loretta Young is generally a dull actress. She doesn't have enough skill to make an impression in the early scenes; but once the part requires histrionics she performs her duties well enough. Certainly her character is morally dubious and therefore fascinating in itself.The best performance by far is Edward G. Robinson's. One of the great actors of his time, this ugly man has enough talent and star quality to underplay his role to great effect.Orson Welles fans might find this exciting, well-plotted thriller too un-Wellesian to suit them. Otherwise, this is highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As intelligent as one would expect from Welles</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Independently produced by Sam Spiegel, "The Stranger" is a fascinating work by Orson Welles, only flawed by its anti-Nazi preaching, though I guess this judgmental posture was common in movies released after World War II. Even a more praised movie as Roberto Rossellini's "Rome: Open City" contains such discourses. Welles' visuals are something else. Under the influence of Expressionism (a very appropriate treatment for a story about German "legacy"), his images are elegant, and his mise-en-caméra is as intelligent as one would expect from him. From the first time we see the investigator (from his nape), to the following sequence as a Nazi arrives in Mexico and is followed through eerie streets full of shadows, the peculiar tone is set, even if most of the action takes place in a sunny Connecticut town and the story is told directly. Though the movie follows the dictates of so-called zero-degree style, there are indications in Welles' direction to the strangeness of the subject: slightly out of focus shots; bizarre positions of characters' faces in a frame, suggesting dislocation, or a very unconvincing "I will" said by the wife in her wedding ceremony. In one of the most upsetting scenes, Welles keeps the suspect's face out of frame during most of the dialogue, first as his long shadow approaches his wife in bed, and she describes a nightmare, until his hand offers her a lit cigarette. Welles also constructs long takes with few camera movements (as opposed to his famous opening shot in "Touch of Evil"): the conversation between the Nazi comrades in the forest and the subsequent killing in broad daylight, while birds sing and young athletes run around; and a checkers game with the investigator sitting with his back to the camera, creating expectation as he constantly turns to watch the clock in the church. On the other hand, the energetic final confrontation is fragmented in shots from all the main characters' point of view. After this movie, Welles worked again for a major studio, when the following year he did "The Lady from Shanghai" for Columbia, another great movie with a memorable final sequence. Again he was misunderstood (especially for his handling of his star and wife Rita Hayworth) and had to wait ten years until he made "Touch of Evil" for Universal. In my opinion, Welles was most of the time on target, and he did not make only one masterpiece. He did quite a few. "The Stranger" may not be in that category, but it's pretty close.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great film for Welles' "least ambitious"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I discovered this film as a bargain DVD for $4.95 from an outlet store. It was a "Catcom" DVD that was packaged with "The North Star," and also featured a Superman cartoon and bloopers from 1940. The films do not appear as though they're from the original film stock, but for the cost, it was MORE than worth it. I've read other reviews suggesting that Welles didn't put the same effort in this flick as other films he directed. But as I watched the film, I felt a little sad that other filmmakers couldn't have their better films as good as Welles' "least ambitious" film (from another user comment). If other directors could come through with such films, we wouldn't have so many raspberries. Being a photographer, I really enjoyed the lighting, which is much better and effective, like with the love scene between Welles and Loretta Young at the door, with Welles turning to the light after she parted. As far as Young's performance? Maybe she might have been a bit over the top at times, but my eyes widened when I saw her with the gun! Please take a moment to look for this flick. It's well worth watching, especially on a rainy/snowy day. For filmlovers and directors (aspiring AND accomplished), take some tips from the lighting and camera angles. We should have more films out there today that rely on mood instead of technology. After seeing a film by Orson Welles, one can't help but shake one's head that the studios keep relying on special effects these days. I know, it's all about the money.</fullReview>

If you like mystery thrillers then this is for you, the climax is excellent and (as against the likes of Frightened City,) totally unpredicted.There is also some witty subtle comedy with the "self service" cafe and the chequers games.Watch and enjoy - great actors - excellent direction.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You'd expect an Orson Welles movie to be better. Heck, you'd expect that the subject matter, a major Nazi on the run, might inspire a good script. But it's the laughably improbable script that sucks The Stranger into the black hole of turkeydom. (How does the villain fit as quickly and smoothly into American society as we're supposed to believe? Isn't it a bit odd, at his own wedding, that none of his family or friends show up as guests? After a certain point in the plot, why not just arrest him, rather than face screaming headlines, ESCAPED NAZI MASTERMIND RUNS AMOK IN SUPREME COURT JUSTICE'S HOME TOWN?) Plus, the final scene is foreshadowed in such a thuddingly obvious way that you'll likely bust out laughing. Welles' own acting is bad, confined to raising his left eyebrow and staring distractedly away from whomever is talking to him. Skip it and watch The Third Man or A Touch of Evil again instead.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Orson Welles' third picture about a Nazi war criminal hidden as a prep school teacher and newly married to an innocent woman</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Infamous Nazi war criminal called Franz Kindler (Orson Welles) assumes a new respectable identity in a Midwestern little town following WWII , unaware that a government agent (Edward G. Robinson) from the Allied War Crimes commission patiently stalks him . But his name is fake and his past is tenebrous . The escaped Nazi sedately living and is about to marry a beautiful as well as unsuspecting young woman (Loretta Young) , daughter of a prestigious judge (Philip Merivale) . But later on , Kindler feels his past closing in and he will need his own spouse to help him elude capture . Interesting Welles movie with plenty of thrills , fine character studio , terrific interpretations and suspense from start to finish . It holds the viewer's interest but admittedly has some flaws , naive moments and wobbles . But it is studded with splendid scenes like the furtive flight across the dockyards at the beginning , the killing in the forests and the final confrontation on the clock tower including the sword wielded mechanical figures that move when the hour begins to strike . The vast New England town exterior sets, including the church with its 124-foot clock tower, were constructed in Hollywood on the back lot of the United Artists studio located on Santa Monica Blvd . Shocking scenes when are shown images about Nazi crimes , in fact it was the first mainstream American movie to feature footage of Nazi concentration camps following World War II . Nice acting by Orson Welles as a Nazi criminal who feels fascination with antique clocks and sedately esconsced in a small Connecticut town when an investigator is tailing him . Edward G. Robinson is perfect as a Federal agent out to get him . However , Orson Welles originally wanted Agnes Moorehead to play the FBI part , then the studio said no and instead gave him Edward G. Robinson . Furthermore , Loretta Young as attractive wife and Richard Long as brother give nicely understated interpretations . Suspenseful and thrilling musical score by Bronislau Kaper . Extremely well made camera-work throughout ; being shot in black and white filled with lights and darks by excellent cameraman Russell Metty . It is also available in horrible computer-colored version . ¨The stranger¨ was efficiently produced by Sam Spiegel and well directed by Orson Welles in 95 minutes runtime , being the only film directed by him to show a profit in its original release . However , Orson has stated that this is his least favorite of his films . Welles was a genius who had a large as well as problematic career . In 1938 he produced "The Mercury Theatre on the Air", famous for its broadcast version of "The War of the Worlds" . His first film to be seen by the public was ¨Ciudadano Kane¨ (1941), a commercial failure , but regarded by many as the best film ever made , along with his following movie , ¨The magnificent Ambersons¨ . After that , he directed this ¨The stranger¨ with an over-pitched acting by the same Welles and often described as his worst . He subsequently directed Shakespeare adaptation such as ¨Macbeth¨ , ¨Othelo¨ and his highly enjoyable ¨Chimes at Midnight¨ or ¨Falstaff¨ . He also performed a lot of films , Orson Welles interpreted for getting financing to shoot his pictures , as he played several exotic characters such as ¨The Tartari¨ , ¨Saul¨ , ¨Cagliostro¨ , ¨Cesare Borgia¨ and ¨Black rose¨ . Many of his next films were commercial flops and he exiled himself to Europe in 1948 . In 1956 he directed ¨Touch of evil¨ (1958) ; it failed in the U.S. but won a prize at the 1958 Brussels World's Fair . In 1975, in spite of all his box-office failures , he received the American Film Institute's Lifetime Achievement Award , and in 1984 the Directors Guild of America awarded him its highest honor, the D.W. Griffith Award . His reputation as a film maker has climbed steadily ever since .</fullReview>

		<fullReview>No, it's not Albert Camus. It's better -- more dramatic, more visual, more bombastic -- it's Orson Welles. Welles at the time was having trouble with his reputation. He couldn't finish a movie, it dragged on forever, it cost a fortune, and so on. So he ran into difficulties raising money, as he would for the rest of his life. This was his shot at proving he could turn in a commercial success as well as anyone else. Don't know if it convinced the venture capitalists but it's an above-average tale of Edward G. Robinson uncovering the identity of Franz Kindler (Welles), one of the more atrocious of the Nazi criminals, who has hidden himself as a teacher at the elite Harper School. (The name of the prep school Welles himself attended as a child.) Welles is a respectable figure in this small New England town. When a deliberately released ex-Nazi tracks him there, with Robinson in his wake, Welles kills his old friend without a qualm and buries him in "a densely wooded area." Welles, as Kindler, even kills his wife's dog that threatens to dig up the body.It's not a sinister/comic masterpiece like "The Third Man," though the plot conforms to a similar template. And it's certainly not "Citizen Kane." It's Welles bringing it all home. But, the thing is, he does a good job of it too. Commercial it may be, but it's unmistakably Welles. It's as if Copley had painted a portrait of Paul Revere and had added at the bottom a slogan -- "Buy Revere Copper." Welles simply can't keep himself out of the picture. There are all sorts of quirky camera angles and strange shadows and overlapping dialog. Best scene: Welles is enclosed in a phone booth. He's calling his wife and inviting her to a meeting that will result in her death without his being there. Welles whistles tunelessly, waiting for the call to go through, and on a notepad with a pencil tied to it, he sketches a clumsy swastika, then turns it into a box and crosses it out. And all the time he projects placidity, even boredom.There are a couple of the unusual character actors that Welles liked to include in his films. Nobody is the equivalent of Dennis Weaver in "Touch of Evil." (This is a commercial effort, right?) But Mr. Potter, who runs the general store comes close. Nobody else comes close. Edward G. Robinson is fun as the war crimes investigator. Loretta Young was a name but adds nothing special. Richard Long is a disaster.Welles gives his real identity away at dinner when he carries on about how the Germans are all into racial superiority and Siegried's sword and whatnot and, when somebody objects that Marx wasn't dictatorial, he replies that Marx wasn't a German, he was a Jew. (Why couldn't Robinson simply have vetted Welles' curriculum vitae?)Somebody quotes Emerson's famous statement that, to someone who has committed a crime, the earth is made of glass. Emerson was into "immanent justice," meaning that even if men didn't catch you at it, God would give it to you in the neck in the form of bad luck. (That's New England for you.) Welles doesn't get it in the neck. He gets it in the abdominal cavity in a very dramatic (and commercial) climax.The movie was made to satisfy all tastes and it gets the job done. Really worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Everything comes together in this crime drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The thing is, there really is no mystery in this film as far as plot is concerned. From the beginning you know who and what the players represent and you pretty much know what outcome the production code of this era - 1946 - demands. The thrilling part is seeing how everything works out. It is after the war, and Nazi Konrad Meineke has been imprisoned awaiting execution for war crimes. However, the real target of the Allied task force is Franz Kindler (Orson Welles), who is supposedly the mastermind behind the concentration camps and the genocide practiced there. The only problem is, nobody knows what he looks like - there are no photographs. Wilson (Edward G. Robinson), a member of the Allied task force, decides to let Meineke escape, knowing that as Kindler's right-hand man during the war he will lead the Allies right to Kindler. Meineke does just that and Wilson follows close behind, all the way to the small New England town where Kindler is living under the identity of Professor of History Charles Rankin. Unfortunately for Wilson, before Meineke can contact Kindler, Meineke spots him as someone who is tailing him and gives him a huge headache - knocking him unconscious. However, Meineke believes he has killed the man.Meineke and Kindler represent the two types of evil. Meineke is the type that tries to fool himself - he believes that if he confesses his past sins to God he can escape consequences, and even continue on doing evil - such as his decision to kill Wilson - as long as he keeps confessing those sins once they are past. No real change has occurred. Kindler is the kind of evil that is content to fool others. When such men meet, the type that levels with himself always has the upper hand over the one that fools himself, and thus it is with Meineke and Kindler. Kindler decides - with him believing that the only person tailing Meineke is dead - that killing Meineke will cut the last link between himself and the past, and that is what he does.The last step in Kindler's plan to elevate himself above suspicion is to marry the daughter of a Supreme Court Judge (Loretta Young), and so he does, only hours after he wipes Meineke's blood from his hands. The fly in the ointment is that Wilson is not actually dead, and knows that Kindler is in the town somewhere under an assumed name. Wilson soon narrows his focus to Rankin/Kindler, and the rest of the film is the odd dance that these two do as each of these people know who the other is but cannot prove it and cannot tip their respective hands before the time is right.Robinson is very effective as Wilson, whose precision in his hunt matches Kindler's and as such he is left a rather unpersonalized and objective character - he isn't even given a first name here. He only shows passion in the opening and closing scenes. Welles' Franz Kindler is a ticking time bomb whose smooth facade gradually cracks under the tension of Wilson's methodical pursuit, as he is accustomed to being the cat, not the mouse. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Marvelous work by the "would-be genius."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Stranger is Welles' first film as a director under a new studio with new rules. After the incredible works of Citizen Kane and The Magnificent Ambersons, Welles directs and stars in this tight, intense film noir that plays as well as any other great film from the 1940s. Edward G. Robinson is very well cast as the lead agent trying to hunt down the dangerous Nazi spy played by Welles. Loretta Young is also very good as the naive woman who marries Welles not knowing who he really is. The direction is flawless, especially the final scene with the clock tower. Overall, this is yet another masterpiece to add to Orson Welles' matchless resume. It is films like these that convince me he is the greatest director of all time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An under-rated Welles'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of those studio films Welles' made in order to finance more cherished projects but, despite that, it still stands as a superior product of its time. No film before this, as far as I'm aware, had explored the subject of ex-Nazis hiding themselves amidst normal everyday people (the war, after all, was only a year in the past), and surprisingly few have done so since.Welles cast himself as Franz Kindler, overseer of the extermination of countless Jews during the Nazi regime, now masquerading as college professor Charles Rankin in Connecticut and about to marry all-American beauty Loretta Young. Canny Edward G. Robinson, however, an investigator for the War Crimes Commission, has released a lesser war criminal (Konstantin Shayne) rightly believing that he will lead him to Kindler.The writing credit goes to Victor Trivas, but the film is peppered with dialogue that suggest he perhaps had more than a little help from Welles. The speech Rankin gives at dinner, for instance, in which he describes the nature of the German character to his fellow guests and inadvertently (although a little glaringly, it has to be said) gives himself away, smacks of Welles' eloquent pen.While, for the most part, the chain of events that leads to the inevitable climax, is believable, Loretta Young's character, as others have mentioned here, is something of a problem. Not only does she grate, she comes across as too stupid at times. Nervous breakdown or not (and you don't get more symbolic of that than a snapped pearl necklace) even she would have been smart enough not to send her brother to meet her 'loving' husband in that clock tower. Despite this, Welles manages to engineer some nicely suspenseful moments, and it's fascinating to watch his character very slowly fall apart as the net grows ever tighter around him.Definitely worth a look.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent, timeless and improbable noir thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To view The Stranger in its proper context, the audience must recall that the film was released a little over a year after the end of World War II - a time when most Americans were preoccupied with three major fears - nuclear war, Nazis and the spread of communism. The Stranger exploits the second of these. Orson Welles plays Franz Kindler/Charles Rankin - a Nazi who has settled in small town America and recently wedded the lovely Mary Longstreet (Loretta Young). Kindler's past begins to catch up with him as a trap is set involving one of his Nazi colleagues, and it quickly becomes clear that Kindler is an obsessive, ruthless, sociopath. Edward G. Robinson's Mr. Wilson is a smart, likable, War Crimes Commission Inspector who is sent out to discover what the trap has ensnared.Welles and Robinsom engage in a subtly vicious cat and mouse game, with Young and her brother (played by Richard Long) somewhere in the middle. The acting is superb, the directing great, the cinematography is wonderful and the script is excellent. Despite the somewhat unlikely plot, the whole story feels very believable because of Welles' extraordinary directing, the solid script, and the effusive talent of the principal cast. Although some have commented negatively on Welles' performance, I believe that he nailed the characterization of Kindler/Rankin in this film, and acted (though more subtly) right at the very high standards set by Young and Robinson. Young's role was probably the most challenging of the lot, and, as usual, she gets it very right and manages to evoke all of the sympathy the role demands. I will also briefly mention the one little performance surprise this film offered me - Richard Long. Long plays a college-aged brother of Young, and gives a very strong supporting performance in this highly uncharacteristic role.Although widely regarded as a minor success in Welles' vast repertoire of good films, I believe The Stranger should be reconsidered for a better rank in the Welles canon. Although elements of the story are dated, the themes are timeless, and this film would make a fine remake with minor plot modifications.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"The Stranger" and a Postwar World of Disillusion</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'That scrapbook of expressionsim.' --Fritz Lang on Citizen KaneIt's still hard for us to comprehend the chaos and disillusion immediately following WWII. Any number of illusions about Western civilization were shattered, and the world as they say, has never been the same since. Our present-day cynicism was unthinkable to most Americans prior to the Second World War, and something like the Holocaust was impossible to even imagine. 'The Stranger' enters-into that twilight-moment between the realizations and the resulting-cynicism of a new-age, and has an unintended-link to Welles's theme of "lost-edens", and of lost-innocence. Lost innocence is the main-theme of The Stranger, and Orson Welles does it in a larger-than-life style that marks all great cinema. Those wonderful low-shots from 'Citizen Kane' are there, and much-much more! Welles's use of wide-angle shots comes into its own here, though it is nearly invisible as technique. The film was popular in its day, and it kept Welles in the Hollywood game a little-longer (as it was designed-to), but not at RKO. This would be his final film for the studio. It's funny that people underrate this film, and I ascribe this to baggage--and how could anyone dare say Welles's acting is 'wooden'?! He is unconvincing if you don't know the historical-background of the era. The Stranger is a very 'Langian' film in the Welles-canon, and it makes us feel complicit with a Nazi-character. For 1946, this is an impressive lesson-learned by Welles and co-writer John Huston on the subject of collective-guilt. The bulk of the screenplay was executed by Anthony Veiller, from a story by Victor Trivas, but rest-assured the anti-fascist message is all Huston and Welles. It should be noted that The Stranger is possibly the very-first commerical motion-picture to show the horrors of the Holocaust in Europe. Many Americans got their first-glimpse in this film, since the military was forbidding the dissemination of footage at this time. Perhaps this was Welles's other sin--the first being Kane-- against the establishment of 1946?Many Americans had fought-against Nazi Germany (and industrial-employers in the labor-struggle, since many unionists equated Big Business with Fascism, and National Socialism was supported by certain industrialists like Henry Ford) to end European-fascism. There was an idea of a 'United Front' against fascism within the Old Left that had carried-over from the Spanish Civil War (1936-1939). Edward G. Robinson's Nazi-hunting character (possibly the first in an American film) represents a continuation of this Old Left trend that arose during the Great Depression. Surprisingly, it even survived the war. But this inertia would be squashed by the anti-Communist backlash, and the creation of the Cold War witchhunts by people like Richard Nixon, Thomas Dies and many others in Congress and the State Department/Executive Branch. In 1946, Germany was central to EVERYTHING, and The Stranger represents a specific-moment in our culture--an incredibly-important one. Sometimes, a movie is smarter than the audience (and more mature), and yet can still be entertaining.The exchange-between the Robinson-character and the Welles-character (Franz Kindler) on whether Karl Marx could be German because he was a Jew was echoed in most anti-Communist literature of the era. It was not simply Nazis who believed this, but radical anti-Communists like Gerald L.K. Smith and his ilk in the American Bund. It also existed in the halls of Congress in 1946. And while this film is certainly to be viewed as a stab at European and American fascism, it is really a great thriller, too. There are so many shots in this film whose composition can only be called dead-on; it is a riveting crime-drama that equals Hitchcock's work in the same period, sometimes outdoing-it. An on-the-run Nazi was VERY exciting in 1946, and for many, it wasn't so difficult to imagine. A number of reviewers have noted that Welles's dialect is 'too-good', but one should remember that there were German-Americans who returned to Germany to join National Socialism's ranks. Many of these individuals had been born in the United States, and so, a prominent-Nazi speaking perfect-English is not really far-fetched. A 20-minute South American prologue of Kindler on-the-run was cut (and lost?) by RKO-executives, possibly due to political-pressure from the State Department, who were busy hiding 'useful' Nazis ('Good Germans') in 'Operation-Paperclip'. Welles and Huston (like Chaplin) can be seen as a members of the 'Old Left', which is a fine-distinction over being a Nazi/anti-Communist (and I hate Communists, too!). This film has everything you want from Orson Welles, from the small-town checkers games at the Pharmacy shot in intense close-ups, to the incredible clocktower finale, it's simply time for a reassessment of such a great film noir! Buy the Roan group DVD, it's got an additional 10-minutes over the standard 85-minute cut, and the quality is excellent. How often does a thriller REALLY put you so close to the killer? Underrated, a gross-sin.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Above Average Orson Welles</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>POSSIBLE SPOILERSBeing a huge Orson Welles fan, I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. Being his third film after his masterpiece - Citizen Kane, he still shows that he can produce films of a high caliber without breaking any new ground. Despite receiving an academy award for Best Story, it is, in my opinion, a pretty straightforward movie: Nazi hides out in America under the guise of a prep school teacher and is pursued by the wonderful Edward G. Robinson. Great atmosphere, clever editing and Welles' trademark long takes without cutting make this movie more than just an average film noir. The tension builds up and the scenes with Welles and Robinson are brilliantly played. Despite all these positive facts, the film, as stated earlier, fails to break any new ground. But, after the huge hype he received after Citizen Kane and the brilliant "The Magnicificent Ambersons",it is nice to see him remaining within the budget and pulling of a successfully satisfying film. My one main criticism about this film is that when i bought the DVD, I hadn't seen the film, and on the blurb on the back of the case it gives details of how "the Nazi gets impaled on the sword on the clock"!. Needless to say i was not impressed. But, other than that, a hugely enjoyable film from a master film-maker far ahead of his time.(****/*****)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I remember seeing Edward G. Robinson in some old movies on late night TV when I was a kid and finding him interesting. When I saw 3 Edward G. Robinson Movies on one DVD for $9.99, how could I, a movie buff, say no?***********************MILD SPOILERS AHEAD*****************************Of the three Edward G. Robinson movies on the DVD, this one, The Stranger, was my favorite. Scarlett Street was a close second with The Red House being a curiosity piece but not as good.In The Stranger, Edward G. Robinson plays some type of government or federal agent searching for a notoriously brutal Nazi who somehow kept his identity hidden during WWII and is now hiding in the U.S. Edward G. Robinson's character is quite clever and releases another Nazi gentleman from prison and follows him to Connecticut in search of the notorious Nazi. Got all that?The plot thickens when the released Nazi disappears and Edward G. Robinson's character begins to suspect that a recently married college professor in Connecticut is the brutal Nazi killer he is looking for. It's a cat and mouse game that ensues and the unsuspecting wife of the notorious Nazi also begins to realize that she has married a monster and it may cost her her life.Engrossing! It's skillfully directed by Orson Wells. Edward G. Robinson, Orson Wells and Loretta Young are dynamite in this movie. Loretta Young has the trickiest role in this film and she pulls it off masterfully. If she hadn't played her character just right, the movie would have fallen apart. Edward G. Robinson is terrific too. Orson Wells is generally very good in this movie with only a minor glitch or two in his performance where you can tell he is acting. A young Richard Long is interesting along with Martha Wentworth in a fabulous turn as the housekeeper and the great acting in a scene stealing performance by the gentleman who played the store keeper.This film is a pleasure to discover. I'd rate it a 90/100. Don't miss it if you like 1940's movies. To be honest, I enjoyed this move more than the highly acclaimed Citizen Kane which I believe was also directed by Orson Welles.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Did Orson ever do anything in moderation? Like Touch of Evil, this one has overheated writing, acting and direction, all due no doubt to the larger-than-life aspirations of Mr. Welles.The story here is painfully simple - find the Nazi and bring him to justice. Thanks to IMDb, I now know that there was more of a prologue before Welles is discovered, because the way it is now, one minute the guy's south of the border somewhere, the next he's getting off the bus in Connecticut. With Edward G. not even trying to hide, he's right next to the guy the whole time, puffing smoke in his face! OK, so they found Nazi Welles. Everyone knows it's him, there's no need for the trapping and plotting, why not just arrest and try him, if it's the wrong man he will go free? Oh well, that wouldn't be much of a movie would it? Better to keep putting poor loving wife Loretta in constant peril. And give Orson a chance to over-emote all over town. At least they didn't try to poison her, I guess they felt that was too cliché even for them. Edward G. is awfully blasé about Loretta's situation too, he seems to think that if she needs to die, well that's a small price to pay.Disappointing film on all counts. It does feel like low-rent Hitch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What is all the fuss about?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'The Stranger': a film made very shortly after the end of the war, and concerning a Nazi war criminal (Welles) leading a new life as a teacher in a town in Connecticut. Incidentally, the video jacket on my copy states that Welles' character settles down 'in a small mid-west town'. Connecticut is in the mid-west? I've given up trying to work out where the mid-west is supposed to be. I've decided it must comprise everywhere in America except California and Florida.What is good about the movie? Edward G. Robinson is adequate as the cop who is chasing Welles. The photography is usually good, sometimes very good, with some very nice composition and use of light and shadow, but not much of it is exactly jaw-dropping. A few scenes contain nice little writer/director touches, and if you wanted to, you could probably pick the film apart, finding symbolism in the repeated motifs of clocks, checkerboards and so on, but again, I didn't find that any of this particularly bowled me over.What was bad about it? Welles is completely unconvincing as the Nazi, and just looks overly dramatic and silly most of the time. Most of the rest of the cast are similarly unimpressive. The storyline is disappointingly predictable, and what are, I suppose, meant to be plot twists usually fall flat. * Minor Spoilers *For instance, Robinson suddenly wakes up in the middle of the night after a dinner party, because he's realised that Welles' comment about Jews not being Germans is the sort of thing a Nazi would say. You mean, up till then he'd been _suckered_ by that lame speech, after formerly being convinced he had his man? Good God! I thought he'd just been playing along. And what about the scene where Robinson decides that Welles might try to kill his wife, but this might be the only way to catch him, so we'll have to just see what happens, but he does tell the aged maid to keep an eye on her! Did the police actually work like that in the USA in 1946?Not a bad film, but a long way from being a great one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Make no mistake, this is by far the best movie Orson Welles ever directed or played in. This unheralded classic is what the overrated Citizen Kane aspired to be. If you are disappointed by the hyped up Welles movies, give this one a try. Welles plays a Nazi war criminal who is engaged to the beautiful daughter of a supreme court justice. This is the only real flaw in the movie, since any war criminal would want to keep a lower profile, even though few, if any, people alive could identify the war criminal (as is the case in this movie.) E.G. Robinson plays the hero, a Columbo type chaser of Nazi war criminals. Welles was always at his best portraying the bad guy, and Robinson, known more for gangster roles, was at his best portraying the prototype for what Peter Falk later turned into Columbo. The mood is spectacular. It contrasts the evil and danger that can even infiltrate a scene that would seem to be the safest. Of course it is the performances of screen giants that give this movie an edge, particularly Robinson.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Everyone knows "Citizen Kane," not so many remember "The Stranger" from 1946, a quiet, low-key thriller that is unrelentlessly paced and flawlessly acted. It stars Orson Welles as a Nazi war criminal who has escaped to middle-America and claimed a new life for himself; when a stranger comes looking for him, his entire life is tossed upside down and he even becomes suspicious of his wife's intentions. (Resulting in a darkly gripping scene.) This movie is one of Welles' finest and probably one of the greatest of all time. His direction is top-notch and although it may not be quite as showy or glossed-over as "Citizen Kane," and the film's scale is not as epic, it doesn't need to be.This works very successfully as a simple low-key thriller and the fact that it doesn't try to achieve anything more is one of its better traits. If this were made nowadays no doubt it would be overblown, lacking intelligence and totally predictable -- this is none of the above. It's a must-see film and, as a thriller, certainly should be classified as one of the all-time best.</fullReview>

Perhaps she was directed to do this and it is the character and not Young I have the problem with... but I just did not find her believable in the second half of the film.That being said, this is a great story with wonderful characters. The writing is top-notch, the male leads are powerhouses of their generation. This was allegedly the only Welles film that turned a profit at the time of its release, and deserved to.

		<fullReview>Though I saw this as a grimy, grey and poor transfer in a 'Thrillers Collection' DVD box-set, the direction, story and the characters held it together.Lesser Orson is still premium film-noir and Edward G Robinson is steadfastly reliable as the War Commissions investigator, eschewing a mixture of wisdom and downtrodden-ness. The Nazi he follows, played by Konstantin Shayne, looks and sounds the part as a guilty and scared man. Able to identify Welles' settled schoolmaster Nazi character, he is soon bumped off by Welles.From here-on in, it's about Welles trying, with ever decreasing success to conceal his crime and his identity, especially from the prying eyes of the investigator, who uses the schoolteacher's new American bride to get close to him. This all culminates in a pre-Hitchcockian clock-tower scramble-to-the-death, that's akin to Vertigo.I rather liked the store-keeper Mr Potter (Billy House, who's also the town clerk) and his chequers-playing tactics of getting 25c from each and every competitor and who provides a nice, central link to all the characters. His easy laid back and friendly style balanced that of the arrogant Welles and inquisitive Robinson.While it could be argued that a Nazi living in the U.S would not have an American accent as Welles obviously has, all the rest are fine, including Loretta Young as the bride who radiates vulnerability and naivety. But for me, it's Edward G Robinson's picture as like all great detectives, he just munches on his pipe and scans the view for wrongdoers and wrongdoings. And those looking for an array of camera tricks and directorial cleverness often associated with Welles will be disappointed. There are a few flourishes but generally it's tight and concise and workmanlike.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stylish Cat and Mouse</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stylish noir trading on public's concern with escaped Nazis following WWII. First part is especially intriguing since we can't be sure what's happening or who Franz Kindler is. The atmosphere is typically Wellesian? shadows galore, imaginative camera set-ups, along with dramatic use of sound. Two features, however, standout for me.Once the plot comes into focus, we know Kindler (Welles) must do away with Meinicke (Shayne), but how. The forest scene is inspired, more menacing I think than the finale. The two men are on bended knee, in apparent communion with the forces of good, except one of them is not.Second is Welles' depiction of small town America through druggist Potter (House, in a splendid performance). Grossly over-weight, he sits all day in front of his checkerboard, hoping to entice some sucker into a game, so he can cheat them out of a quarter. Worse, he makes customers serve themselves, apparently so he won't have to move his bulk. Not exactly the neighborly small town of Shadow of a Doubt (1943), for example.Given the movie's many arresting features, I'm not sure why its profile isn't higher among both noirs and the Welles canon. My best guess concerns a general absence of ambiguity among both characters and situations. Instead, the screenplay is a straight pursuit film of good vs. evil that makes good use of cat and mouse, and of atmosphere, but is unexceptional in storyline. So if you're looking for stylish suspense without tricky moral complications, this is a movie to catch.</fullReview>

Orson Welles (on "The Stranger") "I started at the top and have been working my way down ever since." ? Orson Welles Edward G Robinson plays a dogged Nazi Hunter hot on the trail of a murderous Nazi bad guy played by Orson Welles. It turns out that Welles is hiding in a small American town, has married a local girl and is working as a school teacher. Can Robinson apprehend Welles? Will Welles escape? What will Welles' wife make of the news that her husband is a Nazi? Such are the questions this film asks.Thankfully Welles jazzes this hokey plot up with his customary visual pizazz. Welles' aesthetic has always felt like a day out at a circus fun-house, the director liberally pulling crane shots, long takes, quirky compositions and bravura tracking shots out of his bag of cinematic tricks. After battering us with technique, the film then ends with an action sequence in a clock-tower, appropriately tense, but derivative when compared to the Hitchcockian set pieces it seeks to emulate (most notably the windmill sequence in "Foreign Correspondent").Thematically the film hopes to shake the complacency out of its postwar audience, Welles even going so far as to insert horrific Holocaust footage into his picture. The idea here is to juxtapose small town America, with its beautiful clock-towers, Norman Rockwell storefronts, saintly marriages and white picket fences, with the infiltrative rot of fascism. As such, "clocks" and "clock-towers" are a repeated motif in the film. Everyone's running out of time. Do something before it's too late.On another level ? and this is the only reason Welles made the film ? "The Stranger" is implicitly about Welles' own career. A stranger in Hollywood and in need of money after the failures of "The Magnificent Ambersons" and "It's All True", this film is about Welles playing a movie director who infiltrates Hollywood, works for the bad guys, proves himself adept at fixing clockwork plots and sells his soul in the process. That's why Welles' character is so charming and why a gangster (Robinson = Little Caesar) is cast as our good guy. Welles knows his time is up in Hollywood. Best to take the money and run.7.5/10 ?

Yet the plot is extremely uneven, with ridiculous holes and an ending you could have predicted with an hour to go that detract substantially from the end product.The introduction is tedious; the first 10-15 minutes could easily have been chopped from the film so that it starts where it ends; in a small college town in Connecticut.There are plot holes galore in this film. If the former Nazi Robinson is following got religion while in Allied custody, why is it that he feels no compunction about clocking Edward G? And is it at all credible that after being presented evidence that Welles is a former Nazi responsible for the Holocaust, Loretta Young's brother and father would not insist that she be kept away from this monster? Instead they meekly agree not to disclose what they have learned lest Welles get away. And at the end, nobody can think of where Welles might possibly be hiding out until of course the plot calls for each of them to remember the town clock where Welles has been spending all of his spare time.Terrific performance by Young as she slowly realizes that her new husband is evil incarnate. Billy House amuses as a checkers-crazy shopkeeper. The film made waves due to the use of graphic Holocaust photos in a crucial scene. Although the climax at the tower is telegraphed early, Welles' obsession with fixing the clock is a terrific metaphor.But the ending is clunky and the absurd last line, "Pleasant dreams," should draw a horse-laugh, jolting you right out of the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I'm sorry to say, but I found this movie weak...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I happen to stumbled upon a copy of this film in a DVD 2 pack called 'Citizen Welles' with Welles' adaptation of Franz Kafka's The Trial at a store that sells DVDs at the mall not far from where I lived. Being a fan of Welles' work that I had seen, and having wanted to see both of these films but believing that they would be difficult to find, I didn't think twice about buying the 2 pack. Being a little bit more interested in seeing The Trial I decided to watch that one first, and I loved it. I then watched The Stranger, which, after just seeing what Welles had done with the Trial, and having already owned Kane and The Lady from Shanghai, I was somewhat underwhelmed with this film. Watching it right after the Trial was probably no the best was to bring out the strengths of the picture, it just felt ho-hum to me. Comparing it to Welles' other noir films like Lady from Shanghai, the Stranger has nothing that stands out in it, and even compared to non-Welles noirs like Postman Always Rings Twice (a film and Novel I love) it still doesn't stand out.Oh yeah, the Jeffery Lyons commentaries on both of the Citizen Kane disks are terrible, especially for a retrospective commentary. Lyons doesn't seem like he knows what he's talking about other than when he's giving the life story of one of the attractive supporting female cast members. He gives absolutely no insight into either of the films. I personally got the impression, in the case of the Trial specifically, not only that did he had not prepare prior to recording the commentary tracks, but also that he hadn't even watched them in a quite a long time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An epic cat and mouse game</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It has been said time and time again that Orson Welles was never a fan of this film. I feel he may have been too harsh a critic of it.The film wraps you in the story, and moves at an amazing pace, never seeming to slow down and let you catch your breath, something that today's film directors should learn.Mr. Wilson, an agent who hunts down escaped Nazi's, is played to amazing tour De force effect by Edward G. Robinson, perhaps one of the greatest screen actors of all time. He's allowed a Nazi war criminal (played by Konstantain Shayne) to escape in order to catch the mastermind, Franz Kindler (Orson Welles). In a gripping scene, you know that Wilson doesn't like aspects of his own plan, and shows his disgust by breaking his own tobacco pipe.What ensues next is a cat and mouse game. Kindler, seeing his old Nazi mastermind in town, kills him in order to keep his past a secret. His wife, played by Loretta Young, is unaware of Kindler's past, and simply can not see any evil in her husband.The pace is picked up in the final act. In a cinematic first, actual footage from Nazi concentration camps is shown. Nora (Young) is forced to watch the horrors and dead bodies on film, as Wilson speaks of the mastermind behind it all. The showers, to allow the poison to soak into the bodies, was the product of one mind, Wilson says, the mind of Franz Kindler.This is too much for Nora to grasp, as she runs from the house, on the verge of a mental collapse. The stage is set, as Kindler tries to kill all those who know about his past, even his own devoted wife.The only one to meet their demise is Kindler, killed by the very town clock tower that he strives to bring back to life.I feel that this film does not get the credit it deserves as one of the greatest of all time. I encourage anyone who reads this review to watch the Stranger. Neither I, or anyone who follows, can write a review that serves this film justice. This film, even after 100 viewings, and knowledge of the outcome, can still grip you into the story as if you were watching for the first time all over again. Now that's great film making.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting but with flaws</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw "The Stranger" (1946, B&amp;W, 95 min) starring Orson Welles (also director), Edgar G. Robinson, Loretta Young, yesterday at the monthly showing of classic films at the KU faculty alums society (I'm an associate member). Genre: film noir, mystery, etc.This is immediately after WW-II both in setting and time of film production. The plot has the Nazi war criminal, Kindler (Welles), responsible for many of the atrocities of the Nazi death camps, destroying any evidence that would identify him, constructing a new identity and fleeing to the US. At Wilson's (Robinson) urging, the war crimes commission releases one of Kindler's most trusted lieutenants, Meineke, hoping that he will reunite with Kindler so Kindler can be identified, captured and brought to trial. Wilson tails Meineke to a small New England town where Kindler, using forged documents, has a job as a professor of history in a small college.The ploy partially works: Meineke establishes VERY brief contact with Kindler, who -- correctly fearing Meineke had been deliberately released in order to follow him -- quickly kills him and buries his body in the woods before Wilson can make positive identification of Kindler.Kindler has successfully courted Mary (Loretta Young), the daughter of a US Supreme Court justice, figuring their relationship will add to his cover.The rest of the movie deals with the cat and mouse game being played by Kindler and Wilson. IMO, the script does no favors to Loretta Young who first appears as a bright, attractive young woman but she gradually gets dumber and less psychologically realistic as the movie draws to its climactic end.I found Welle's Kindler character quite realistic in most of his psychopathic traits and actions but not his perfect American English without the slightest trace of German accent nor in Kindler's idealization of the Nazi movement and his faith it would rise again; to my knowledge, while psychopaths/sociopaths would profess any ideal they think will serve their momentary purpose, functionally they are without any longterm ideal or faith except satisfying themselves.The acting by Welles and Robinson was good; Loretta Young did very well with the material she was given. I'm sure I'm not the only person with a correct hunch of the exact ending by 2/3rds of the way through this film. While entertaining, it's many levels below Welles' "Citizen Kane" or "The Third Man" so I'll give it half of however many total stars your top is -- 4, 5, or 10. The 1946 NYTimes review liked it even less but many reviewers value it higher than I do.Judge for yourself and see the movie at: http://www.imdb.com/video/hulu/vi2903506969/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Welles' Third Film Is A Corker!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pipe-smoking Edward G. Robinson pursues an elusive Nazi war criminal Orson Welles in his third movie. "The Stranger" is a tightly-knit, black &amp; white, film noir thriller co-starring Loretta Young, Richard Long, and Billy House as Mr. Potter. The technical credits are beyond reproach, especially Russell Metty's first-rate cinematography, Ernest Nims' evocative editing, and top-flight performances by a uniformly superb cast. No, "The Stranger" isn't half as good as "Touch of Evil," but "The Stranger" ranks as one of Welles' more palatable melodramas with intrigue and atmosphere galore. Anybody that enjoys a gripping cat &amp; mouse nail-biter should find themselves wrapped up in this edgy yarn. It helps considerably that the hero is a rather ordinary fellow blessed with superior intuition that a cunning, cold-blooded villain challenges right up to his comeuppance. Robinson's mousy detective, Orson Welles' cornered Nazi war fugitive, and Loretta Young's deceived wife who stands poised between them make this movie worth watching several times. According to the Internet Movie Database, "The Stranger" represented the first Hollywood to show American audiences the infamous Nazi concentration camps. Furthermore, "The Stranger" remains Welles' only film to return a profit, and the lean, mean, no-nonsense pacing underline the brilliant simplicity of this film. Welles appears at his least pretentious here, creating not only solid, three-dimensional characters with his hero, heroine, and villain, but also conjuring up the conservative mind-set in an entire community in a remote corner of Connecticut, far removed from the outside world. You feel like you're watching a white-knuckled thriller in the setting of "It's A Wonderful Life." Ironically, for all its virtues, Welles had little complimentary to say about "The Stranger." A tireless investigator, Mr. Wilson (Edward G. Robinson of "Little Caesar"), with the Allied War Crimes Commission, Department 12, finds himself at the end of his tether. Wilson has been hot on the trail of a notorious Nazi officer, Franz Kindler, who--in Wilson's words--evinced "the most brilliant of the Nazi minds" and conceived the theory of genocide, mass depopulation of conquered countries so that regardless of who won the war, Germany would emerge the strongest in Europe, biologically speaking." Kindler disappeared after the war and destroyed all clues to his identity from Poland and Germany, and nobody has been able to find him. Wilson convinces his reluctant colleagues to release from prison convicted Nazi war criminal Konrad Meinike (Konstantin Shayne of "Vertigo") in hopes that the latter will lead Wilson to Kindler. Wilson is prepared to shoulder the burden of the blame if his plan backfires. Indeed, he is so committed that he smashes his pipe on a table to emphasize his tenacity.Meinike believes that God performed a miracle so that he could escape from his captors and he sets out to find fellow Nazi Franz Kindler. Studio executives cut about 30 minutes of the film as Meinike searches for Kindler in South American. Welles took issue with their decision to eliminate this part. In all fairness, however, they have accelerated the pace and brought the film to its setting in Harper, Connecticut where most of the action occurs. Sources say producer Sam Siegel authorized the deletion because that half-hour slowed down the action. Nevertheless, Meinike learns of Kindler's whereabouts when he obtains a picture postcard with the image of a church steeple. Presto, Welles dissolves to the church in Connecticut, and Meinike looks for History Professor Charles Rankin. Anyway, Meinike arrives in Harper and stashes his suitcase at Mr. Potter's store. Although only a peripheral character, Billy House's Mr. Potter makes quite an impression. Largely, it is the way that Potter runs his store. Potter remains seated while his customers serve themselves and then pay him. Occasionally, he lures Wilson and Rankin separately in games of checkers, dons his visor, and beats them for a quarter a game. Meinike visits Mary Longstreet (Loretta Young of "Ladies Courageous") in his search for Rankin. The meeting between Meinike and Mary turns out to be crucial and Mary discovers later on that not only her life but the life of her husband hangs by the string of that encounter. She directs him to Rankin and the two ex-Nazis meet his deep in the woods so that nobody can see them. Rankin strangles Meinike and conceals the corpse. Not long afterward, the cold-blooded Rankin marries Mary Longstreet. Meanwhile, Wilson noses around Harper and poses as an antiques dealer. He meets Mary's father, U.S. Supreme Court Justice Adam Longstreet (Philip Merivale of "Adventure") and receives an invitation to dinner one evening. During the conversation, Rankin makes a comment that incriminates him in Wilson's eyes. Rankin makes a disparaging observation about Karl Marx that Wilson initially dismisses. Later, Rankin drives Mary's dog Red away from digging up the corpse. When Rankin kicks Red, the film cuts to Wilson waking up to the realization that Rankin is Kindler. "Who but a Nazi would deny that Karl Marx was a German because he was a Jew? Earlier, Wilson was prepared to leave Harper, deciding that Rankin was "above suspicion." Eventually, Meinike's body is found and Mary stands between her husband and justice. The biggest flaw in "The Stranger" is how did Rankin arrive in America and acquire a job as a college teacher. Sometime John Huston collaborator Anthony Veiller penned the screenplay that leaves out some important information that occurred during the missing South America scenes. For the most part, however, Veiller and other writers on "The Stranger" supply us with most of what we need to know. Veiller wrote "The Night of the Iguana," "The List of Adrien Messenger," "Moulin Rouge" and "Beat the Devil" for Huston. Previously, Veiller had contributed his writing skills to Frank Capra's "Why We Fight" series. Veiller's collaborator on "The Stranger" was German born Victor Trivas who received an Oscar nomination for penning the original story that Veiller rewrote as the screenplay.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Modestly enjoyable thriller bears few of Welles' stylistic hallmarks</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1946, Orson Welles' career was in a tailspin. His battle to get "Citizen Kane" released branded him a troublemaker in Hollywood. RKO heavily cut Welles' follow-up to Kane, "The Magnificent Ambersons," while Welles himself was in South America, directing the ill-fated documentary "It's All True" (which wouldn't see the light of day until after Welles' death). To jump-start his directorial career, Welles agreed to direct "The Stranger," a modestly enjoyable thriller that bears few of Welles' stylistic hallmarks.Edward G. Robinson pursues the title character (Welles), who may or may not be an escaped Nazi, through a sleepy Connecticut town. Complicating matters is that Welles has charmed the town's residents, including Loretta Young, whom he marries. "The Stranger" illustrates Welles' concerns that World War II did not spell the end of fascism, and is significant for being the first Hollywood film to include actual footage from Nazi concentration camps. But by Welles' own admission, "The Stranger" was more of an attempt at profitable Hollywood product than an artistic statement. The trademark Welles style does surface in the South American prologue and the drugstore scenes, and the film achieves genuine suspense during the paper chase scene and the grand finale atop the town's clock tower."The Stranger" did not re-establish Welles as a force in Hollywood; he directed two more American films ("The Lady From Shanghai" and "Macbeth") before departing for Europe, where his genius was better appreciated. But "The Stranger" remains a well-paced thriller, more enjoyable when considered apart from Welles' more distinctive work.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Harper, Connecticut, is a safe heaven in the midst of a world war. Here nobody locks their doors, the weather is nothing if not picturesque at all times, heartland US. The most unlikely place in the world to go Nazi-hunting, right? Guess again.Orson Welles' charismatic New England professor is escaped Nazi Franz Kindler, orchestrator of the Endlösung, the genocide on the Jews. On his tracks is Edward G. Robinson of the Allied War Crimes Commission, intent on bringing Kindler to justice. Caught in the middle is Loretta Young as Welles' naive young bride.'The Stranger' is not vintage Welles by a long shot, Welles the director that is. Its ambitions are not exactly towering, but on the other hand the movie actually made money, something Welles never tried before or after, and it's a fluent entertainment piece in a visually impressive expressionistic style with a very volatile camera.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>All well and good, but Welles is marking time here.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a reasonably effective thriller; certainly of a slightly Hitchcockian hue. Not the film expected of Welles, the cinema's talisman for all time after making 'Citizen Kane' and then the even more majestic 'The Magnificent Ambersons' (a masterpiece only blighted by cuts and studio additions), but judged simply on its own merits, it passes inspection.There is comparitively little of the cinematic beauty and invention of his previous films; the plot is rendered carefully, methodically, in a filming relatively orthodox of nature. One feels many avenues are not explored, but then this is a genre film, quite unlike the tapestries of 'Kane' and 'Ambersons'. The acting helps; Edward G. Robinson (first film of his I have seen) redoubtable and considered as the hard-nosed, gently investigative detective, Welles possibly one-note as the war criminal at-large but still reasonable, and Loretta Young imbuing her character with just enough suppressed neurosis. Young is a seasoned enough actress to draw some life into a potentially thankless role. Welles at times displays a masterly vocal delivery of his lines, but often seems visually ill-at-ease in his role; it's not a great performance, and slightly lessens the film's impact at times.A decidedly unspectacular effort in comparison to past (and indeed future) triumphs on Welles' part, but a well-made, pretty enjoyable confection.Rating: - *** 1/2/*****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This Orson Welles film was a great disappointment to me. I think the film was way below his standard. The plot is good and interesting, and must have been perfect back in 1946. However, the script is made in such a hurry, that the film is so full of inconsistencies that the whole film is made into a stupid laugh.There's so little sense in what's said and what's happening that is simply plain ridiculous to watch. You could argue thus is intertwining, and it sure is. But then again, this was never meant as a comedy, though it almost is.The tension which is built up nicely in the beginning just falls over in the ridiculous second part of the movie. It's almost like today's lame Hollywood block busters, which really doesn't care about the script and if it works and is credible.The film is nicely shot in black and white, and has some great angles and nice stylistic work, which give away this is Welles' work, but this film is by no means a masterpiece. A classic, OK, but not worth much as to compare with e.g. Alfred Hitchcock's work from the same period. Simply, don't expect to much of this!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>We are in the college town of Harper, Connecticut, one day a man known only as Wilson arrives, he's a member of the War Crimes Commission, in short he's a Nazi Hunter. On his radar is the man thought to have invented the Nazi Death Camps, Franz Kindler, surely such a despicable and low human being is not residing in this lovely little place?The Stranger finds director (and star) Orson Welles fusing two rather interesting facts, fact one is that this picture, coming at a time when Welles was really struggling as a viable artist, is one of his most conventional pictures, fact two is that it's also one of his finest achievements. All Welles' traits are here, the expert use of shadows and lights, tricksy camera angles, buildings carrying auras. A clock tower at the centre of the piece is a foreboding character all by itself, listen out for the clock tower dongs and I swear to you they sound like a death knell beckoning us in to its belly, this is Welles crafting wonderful atmospherics to enhance the mood in this small and picturesque town. Yet it's probably with his acting performance that he achieves the best rewards, it's made clear to the viewers from the off that Welles is the villain of the piece, it's not in question, the issue is if he can avoid and escape the clutches of Edward G Robinson's determined Wilson? Here Welles excels because this is no cartoon cut out Nazi portrayal, this is cold and calculating stuff, cynical with devilment seeping from his pores, he arrogantly believes that he is just and correct at every turn. Loretta Young (Mary Longstreet) plays off of Welles very well, on the surface it looked like she wasn't being asked to be anything more than a foolish love interest, but as the last quarter arrives she gets some meat to chew on and aided by Robinson in perfectly restrained form, gives us a finale that in true Welles tradition is as memorable as it is unfeasibly gorgeous. It's a fitting end to a truly great picture, highly recommended viewing, tight, tense and terrific. 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a very good film--especially since it is very different and features some excellent performances. In particular, I enjoyed seeing an older Edward G. Robinson in the role of the Nazi hunter. Plus, while Hollywood did a lot of anti-Nazi propaganda films during the war, as soon as it ended, it was almost like the 3rd Reich hadn't existed except in war films. Other than a sensationalistic and generally dopey films like MARATHON MAN and BOYS FROM BRAZIL, I can't think of that many movies that dealt with post-war Nazis. And I really appreciated this type of film following the war.About the only thing about the movie that just didn't ring true was the character played by Loretta Young. I doubt if the problem is her fault, but more the way her character was written. She seemed genuinely stupid and hyper-emotional and how she dealt with her husband at the end of the film just seemed ridiculous. Too bad, as otherwise this was an excellent film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>one of Welles's most audience-accessible films is also one of his most entertaining</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sure, the Stranger is one of the 'studio' projects for filmmaker Orson Welles, and in the story one might think from the story description on this site it might not be his kind of territory (Welles himself said this was his least favorite of his directed films). But it is in the directorial style, and in the performances (Welles and Robinson most particularly) that the film is given his 'stamp' of sorts. And at the core the film is really just a solid thriller, and because of that it has immediate appeal for its story turns, the scenes where the truth and lies are bounced around, and in the exquisitely done climax on the clock tower (maybe second only to Back to the Future in using a clock tower in a film). It is through such typically audience-powerful elements, as well as with a bit of immediately post WW2 espionage, that Welles is able to flow into it his own personality, with little bits of very dark humor and theatrical drama that is, above all else, compelling.In terms of looking at the acting, it's right here that right away Welles breaks from what could've been a good but fairly typical style with the script. Keeping in mind that from the moment he appears on screen the character of Dr. Rankin (aka Frankz Kindler), there's quite an amount of guilt and suspicion he's trying to avoid, from himself less so from him wife and the Detective (Edward G. Robinson). So, Welles is able to really play this for all it's worth; the smallest glance and minute eye gesture is meant for dramatic effect, and as much as one might be tempted to chuckle how obvious it might be, it works. I did believe, at the least, the pure theatricality of Welles in the film, and he photographs himself and others in this similar way, however much with the film-noir style as well. And with sturdy character actors like Robinson- who is actually fairly more subtle and in a different way of interest than in, say, Key Largo- and Loretta Young, Welles is able to have his players in place.It's no doubt the material could be done by other filmmakers (it's one of the few of Welles's films that was barely written by him). In this filmmaker's hands and eyes, however, it does get some different twists here and there. Through his cinematographer Russel Metty (later responsible for the Oscar winning cinematography of Spartacus), Welles gets some angles and shots, sometimes really sweeping and telling of it being quite the movie-movie (if one could say it that), that other filmmakers wouldn't think of. And I loved the musical score, by Bronislaw Kaper , adding the kind of tone that is often replicated, more or less, by composers of lesser musical scores of today's thrillers, with a nice touch of European in it for the subject matter. So, if you're looking for an Orson Welles/Edward G. Robinson fix and haven't come across the Stranger yet, you may come in for a really pleasant surprise.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nazis In The Belfry</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The reason people talk about "The Stranger" 60 years later is because it was Orson Welles' first directorial effort after he was evicted from the Mercury Theater cocoon which gave us "Citizen Kane" as well as its worthy follow-ups "The Magnificent Ambersons" and "It's All True." The reason "The Stranger" is worth talking about is because it features one of the greatest performances by that criminally-ignored actor, Edward G. Robinson.Robinson plays Mr. Wilson, an anti-Nazi hot on the trail of a war-crimes-tribunal escapee Wilson hopes will lead him to Franz Kindler, architect of the Final Solution. Kindler, we quickly discover, has set himself up as a history teacher, Mr. Rankin, at a Connecticut prep school. There he is about to marry Mary Longstreet, the daughter of a U.S. Supreme Court justice, "a liberal," Kindler relates with chilling amusement.As Kindler, Welles gives a weak performance. There's a scene where he chews on more than his dinner as he gives himself away, by saying Marx was not a German because he was a Jew. Actually, I'd say the jig was up when he revealed his novel notions of reconstruction. The scenes between him and Loretta Young, who plays his too-trusting bride, are uncomfortably clichéd.But Robinson is a marvel throughout the film. Of course, he is best remembered for playing a gangster, but he shone playing good guys, too. "Double Indemnity" is the best of them, though "Confessions Of A Nazi Spy" is good, too, and somewhat to the point here as it features Robinson playing a role similar to "The Stranger," though at the beginning of World War II rather than the end.Robinson's character here, Mr. Wilson, might in fact be "the stranger" of the title, though it seems to refer to Kindler. Frankly, Kindler may be a Nazi bent on killing innocents, but Wilson is about as coldblooded a character. From the beginning, he seems to be half-playing a game with the Nazi he is chasing, smoking his pipe and staring directly into the eyes of his fearful prey. Perhaps the war crimes he has immersed himself in investigating have stripped him of any human kindness. The way he works on Mary's brother Noah and his father the judge is remarkable for Wilson's lack of humane concern, perhaps necessary, but still bone-chilling. He's like that all the way to the end. Just think for a moment about that final line he says to Mary, after all she's just been through. He's on the side of the angels, but Robinson turns in one of his most devilish performances.There are nice scenes in and around the town of Harper, and I agree with those viewers who see shades of "Shadow Of A Doubt" in its depiction of small-town life, even though that took place in California and this is happening in Connecticut. Billy House as Mr. Potter dominates the scenes he is in with his amiable whimsy and the eyeshade he dons when he's in the middle of a serious checkers game (quarter stakes).But "The Stranger" never really gels as a movie. Welles as director is strangely ill at ease with Wells as star. Too many cow-eyed portentous stares, not enough subtle moments like that low-key moment with Mr. Potter when he pays for a soda after finding out Mr. Wilson's hot on his trail. Young may have been a fine actress, but she doesn't get much help from a script that serves up every frail female stereotype in the book. Her every reaction seems more suited to soap opera.Yet there's more to like here than dislike. Take the satisfying conclusion, where Kindler/Rankin has his moment of truth in the church tower where he has been working on the clock. It's the one effective scene between him and Mary, and very gripping. Welles was a gifted artist, but a superb craftsman, too, and if "The Stranger" offers more evidence of the latter, who are we to quibble? Pleasant dreams?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was disappointed with this Orson Welles effort. The story revolves around the capture of a well known war criminal ???. I thought the performances from the cast were a little wooden and the script was unbelievable. A good overall to the entire film would have benefited both audience and cast, it definitely lacked something. It wasn't one of Welles better films in my opinion, he could have added a touch of suspense and intrigue. As it is, we have a film that goes through the motions of telling the story, which (to me) was tiresome. When you consider the talents of Welles, Young and Robinson together you would think you would have a chance to watch a pretty good film. Unfortunately this isn't the case. 5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not up to par</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After just having viewed Welles' classic "Kane" from 1941 (for the umpteenth time), I am definitely disappointed with this 1946 "thriller" (and, NO, it is NOT an example of "film noir"). Yes, it contains the usual Orson flourishes, but it is also ludicrous, with overwrought performances by Young and Robinson. It is a shame that Welles was not allowed to utilize his original choice for the Robinson role - old co-hort Agnes Moorehead! THAT would have been special. Young merely acts like an airhead, particularly being that the script does not supply any emotional bond between her and Orson's character. What makes her feel such loyalty toward a person she hardly knows?? However, I did enjoy Richard Long's subdued performance. And, the location filming is nice - I wish I knew the town (the setting doesn't appear to be a back lot, as the church construction would have been too expensive on the limited budget).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not to be confused for an Orson Welles film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are, of course, many curious ironies in life. Orson Welles, one of cinema's great auteurs, suffered from more than his fair share of these in his career. Most people know the story about how his first film is possible the greatest American film ever made, and almost as many know that despite this fact, he rarely worked in the mainstream of American movie-making again. Relieved of his hitherto unprecedented deal with RKO picture after just two completed films, Welles found himself by 1946 already struggling to find work in Hollywood (a misfortune that would plague him for the rest of his career, and one that he eventually gave up on to make his later films elsewhere), performing a magic show and, in these circumstances, agreeing to star in and direct what was by his standards a run-of-the-mill thriller, The Stranger. His last 'studio' picture, The Stranger was also the most successful film Welles made in his lifetime, and, almost inevitably it is also the worst film he made.The first thing that distinguishes The Stranger from almost all of the rest of Welles' creative output (and quite literally the first - the credits tell us so) is that, although taking the leading role and directing, Welles had no part in writing this film. Now Welles could not ever be classed as one of cinema's great writers, but he was certainly - like Kubrick who followed him - a great adapter. And like Kubrick, Welles was only truly happy and effective when he complete control over the creative drive of a production (this was equally true of his hugely successful time in the theatre). As a result, The Stranger, both in terms of his acting and directing feels like Welles on autopilot. Indeed, where it does raise itself above similar films of the period (and it does so on many occasions - this maybe his least accomplished work, but it is still much more than the work of other comparative cinematic mortals), the effects and camera trickery feel like a tired retread of the techniques pioneered to such dazzling effect in Kane. The use of dissolves (most notably in a playful opening sequence), overlapping dialogue and shadow are undoubtedly a cut above the standard thrillers of the time, but often serve to remind you that you could be watching Kane or The Magnificent Ambersons instead.The plot centres around escaped Nazi war criminal Franz Kindler (Welles), who has managed to pass himself off unnoticed in the small town of Harper, Connecticut as university professor Charles Rankin. His coup de grace is to marry local dame (and daughter of a Supreme Court judge no less) Mary Longstreet, thus putting himself above suspicion. However, the arrival in the town of a fellow Nazi, who himself had been released by Allied forces with the express intention of leading them to Kindler, sets off a chain of events that leads to the unmasking of Kindler, and the inevitable nail-biting finale. Although written without a great deal of flair, the plot is suitably taut, and allowing the audience to know the precise identity of 'the stranger' from the outset is a refreshing change from other genre pieces.The acting alternates between servicable and even enjoyable (in the case of Edward G. Robinson's tenacious and supremely-confident-of getting-his-man government agent), to the down-right lousy (Loretta Young as Rankin/Kindler's loyal bride). Welles himself is not immune, as his performance strays from delightfully sinister at times - the meeting with his fellow Nazi Meinike is a joy of silliness - to the just plain silly, and even wooden at times (not something you'll see written very often about Welles's acting). Stories from Welles's formative years in theatre recall how he often devoted so much of his time to the direction and every other aspect of a performance that he neglected to rehearse his own role at all (invariably the lead), rarely to positive effect. His performance here reminded me of these tales, as one can imagine Welles walking onto set just minutes before a scene, learning his lines on the spot, and delivering a performance that reflected the amount of preparation that went into the scene. One of the film's more memorable scenes (and as such serves to act a summary of the film's shortcomings as a whole) sees Rankin/Kindler deliver a damning indictment of the German race's tendency towards fascism in order to maintain his persona in the presence of Robinson's ever-watchful Wilson. The speech has resonance with Welles's famous speech from The Third Man (made three years later) on the ethics of his 'business', ending with it's mocking of the Swiss, with their five hundred years of democracy producing naught but the cuckoo clock. However, while that scene memorable takes place in the ferris wheel high above Vienna, this scene is confined entirely to the dinner table, with Welles allowing the words quite literally to do all the talking.As it stands, The Stranger is something of an enjoyable curate's egg of a movie, dealing as it does with the immediate post-war period, as people's lives returned to normal (although how much they changed in Connecticut from war to post-war is probably negligible anyway), and stories still abounded of Nazi plots to start another war and whether democracy would be possible in Europe. As said previously, the plot is suitably taut, and holds the attention until the - rather obvious and cliched - finale. However, if this run-of-the-mill in thriller terms, it is the cinematic equivalent of film-making whilst blindfolded, with both hands tied behind the back and standing on one leg for Welles. While it is a crying shame that he was prevented from making more films, particularly in his own country, we can only be thankful that Welles never sold his soul to the studios to make a career on this standard.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Because of a naive script and some plot implausabilities, THE STRANGER is far from one of Orson Welles's best works. However, Welles's worst is still better than most director's best.THE STRANGER is a highly entertaining and enjoyable suspense-filled thriller. The directing is outstanding. As is the master Edward G. Robinson's acting.Definitely worth a rent, and even a purchase for some.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Nazi architect of the Shoah, known only by name, is pursued by a Nazi hunter in post-war New England.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Stranger is a remarkable film for several reasons. One is that it demonstrates Orson Welles' considerable talent for designing interesting lighting effects, for wonderful visual composition, and for creating an atmosphere pregnant with menacing possibilities. Second, is that it contains film footage (however brief and sanitized) of corpses "manufactured" in the Shoah (more widely known as the Nazi Holocaust). In this connection, it also plainly presents Nazism as essentially anti-Semitic, and even contains mention of concentration camps and gas chambers.The latter of these two reasons may seem unremarkable now, but as a student of the Shoah and the history of its handling in popular culture, I was stunned to find this issue addressed in such a direct manner in a Hollywood movie from 1946. After all, even documentaries concerning the Shoah, a decade or more removed from those events, barely mentioned that the principle victims of the Shoah were Jews (see "Night and Fog", Alain Resnais' otherwise excellent 1956 effort). Fears of post-war indifference due to anti-Semitism even led Simon Wiesenthal to spread the untruth that as many as six million non-Jewish people perished in the Holocaust (of the 6-7 million estimated killed, the vast majority were Jews).Perhaps it is this treatment of the Shoah, and the chance to play a Nazi-hunter, that explains the presence of Edward G. Robinson in this picture (he was born a Romanian Jew named Emanuel Goldenberg). The presence of this immensely talented actor begs for an explanation, sadly, because aside from the reasons noted above, the film is simply terrible.The writing, acting (even from Robinson), and direction are about as subtle as a poke in the eye. Every predictable emotion and obvious motive by every character is announced in ridiculously overplayed gestures and movements, accompanied by tedious, wooden dialog, and then explained outright to the audience in yet still more tedious dialog. Imagine Citizen Kane remade using a version of the script that was designed to make the plot and all the characters easily and fully understood by dull-witted eight year olds who suffer from attention deficit disorder. (No offense to such people, I just don't want to see movies made with them as the target audience.) In the mini biography of the screenwriter Victor Trivas here at IMDb, it suggests that he was nominated for an Oscar for his work on this film. If that is true, the Academy Awards very narrowly missed its own Milli Vanilli scandal (the popular music group that won a Grammy only to have it revealed that the "artists" so awarded did not actually do their own singing). Either Trivas regarded movie goers as complete idiots, was himself a complete idiot, or had his work ruined by complete idiots. This screenplay is simply terrible, and even great acting and direction (neither in evidence here) could have saved this movie from being lousy because of it.If you are a fan of the film noir cycle for its visual style only, an Orson Welles completist, or interested in popular culture treatments of the Shoah, check it out. Otherwise, I would recommend two hours of random television viewing first.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing for a Welles</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yes, here's Karahde Khan stabbing another overrated so-called classic. Sorry to all the fans of "The Stranger".First of all, this is NOT a bad movie. Not at all, It's very well-acted and has an important entertainment value. But it's far, real far from being the masterpiece many people sees in it: it's actually a run-of-the-mill propaganda flick, 1940s style, not much better than many studio potboilers that are totally (and sometimes justly) forgotten today.People seem to be praising this movie only because the credits read "Directed by Orson Welles". I adore Welles, but I don't think this is a true Orson Welles film at all. It's clear that Welles had really little or no interest at all in doing it, and therefore his directing seems tiresome, almost like if he wanted to end the damn shooting and direct a more personal project. Of course, "The Stranger" was not a Welles project, he did it because the studio told him to, and he only accepted to demonstrate that he could do any kind of movie (and to get some money for better films).As I've said, the strong point is the acting. Specially from Edward G. Robinson, one of the most gifted actors of classic Hollywood, and sadly overlooked today, as he seems to be remembered only for his gangster roles (where he shined, but he was able of many more registers). Here he plays the good guy, and he's very likeable, althought a little too "knows-it-all". Loretta Young is good too, given that her role's the typical "terrified wife". Welles, as the villain, is not bad but quite inexpressive (specially when compared to his greatest performance as a villain, Hank Quinlan in the far superior "Touch of Evil") and doesn't transmit the falseness that his character would need to hide his true personality: it's more like if he didn't believe in his role - and, once discovered, he's not cold enough... Then there's Billy House, so funny as Mr. Potter, the best-developed supporting character in a movie that suffers from little character development (Hitchcock's masterpiece "Shadow of a Doubt", which has a similar premise, is a funny and credible portrait of a small town, while we never really get into the people of the town in "The Stranger". I think Hitch would have been a better choice for "The Stranger" than Welles. At least he liked this kind of stuff).The script is quite weak. Apart from the lack of character development, it suffers from implausible situations. Would an ex-Nazi commander hit his chaser (Robinson) in the head and run away without being really sure that his victim is dead? Would a brilliant criminal brain, no matter how racist, really make the "Karl Marx was not German, he was Jewish" lapsus in front of the person that is trying to unmask him? Maybe, and maybe not. But how's that the local priest is never in the church and everybody seems to have a key and go in and out of it at any time of the day or night? Too many rhetoric questions, I know, but the mechanism of "The Stranger" just doesn't work like a clock (no pun intended). And I think that it would be more interesting not to make the public inmediately know that Welles is a Nazi: it would be more suspenseful to discover it at the same time the characters do. Probably Hitch (again!) would have chosen this latter option.Overall, an entertaining movie, worth renting (specially if you like classic film), but don't expect a Wellesian masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the more 'efficient' camps</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The thing is, Orson Welles doesn't play a particularly good Nazi, never mind a German, much like he didn't play a particularly good Irishman in The Lady from Shanghai. But that was just a peculiarity with the accent; here we are asked to believe that Welles is none other than the grand mastermind behind the Nazi concentration camps, the bringing of death and destruction of millions of lives and then some. Somehow, his odd little lapses of manner and guise (including a hilarious rant about the 'final solution' at the dinner table, where he is clearly addressing himself) don't really sell this unrepentant evil - and neither does he repeated blank, stony gaze. No doubt the intention here was for a more menacing, brooding look, boiling over under the surface...but his character becomes such a caricature that you almost expect him to burst out with a 'Heil Hitler!' ala Peter Sellers. This film was known for being the first to show footage from the Holocaust on the big screen. Maybe then it might have been a big fuss only a year after the war's end; but it does not really earn the right to use this, because Welles' simply isn't believable. So instead of having a dramatic impact it feels more like a narrative cheat designed to get us to abhor Mr Wilson...and since it doesn't really show much anyway, it falls flat. The supporting characters too, are similarly flat. Perhaps this is where Welles intended to make one of those conventional Hollywood pictures. In any case, he succeeds - the cast is given nothing to work with, and all signs point apparently to the only real conclusion that could be made from this plot. The editing is full of these obtrusive reaction shots of Welles glaring whenever he is required to do so, and the script littered with arbitrary references to the stranger in town that has a mastery for crafting clocks - a point that seems less a character trait and more just a set-up for the final climatic action sequence. This has all the hallmarks of Hitchcock, but none of the thrill. For all the dramatic flourishes of the soundtrack and oversized ominous shadows looming against the wall, there's nothing really scary about Wilson at all. In fact the best scene of the movie almost has us convinced that Mary could possess the capacity to fall as low as her husband; she ecstatically pronounces to him that she has outfoxed those who seek to tear them apart with false accusations, and the key light makes her face very white indeed, almost a ghostly terror blinded by love. But for every one of these there's three of the same when Welles clumsily draws a swastika whilst orchestrating a murder. Yes, this is hilarious. No, it isn't supposed to be.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Taut, Fast-Moving Noir Thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Stranger" was Orson Welles' third completed feature film as director after "Citizen Kane" and "The Magnificent Ambersons". It is a film noir about the hunt for a Nazi war criminal, who has taken refuge in a small Connecticut town where he is posing as a teacher at the local school. The film was made in 1946, and in one respect I felt it might have been better had it been made a few years later. The Nazi, whose real name is Franz Kindler but who goes by the name of "Charles Rankin", seems so convincing in his false American persona that I found it difficult to accept that he had only been living in the country for a year at most. In other respects, however, it was very timely. It was one of the first Hollywood films to deal with the question of the Holocaust and even included documentary footage, thus helping to educate the American public about the true nature of Nazism.The film is clearly influenced by the work of Alfred Hitchcock, who in 1946 also made a film, "Notorious", about Nazi fugitives. That film is mostly set in Brazil, and "The Stranger" also originally included scenes set in Latin America, but which were cut before it was released. The Hitchcock film to which this one bears the closest resemblance, however, is "Shadow of a Doubt" from three years earlier. Both films deal with a stranger who arrives in a small American town, in Hitchcock's case in California rather than New England. Both men initially fit in well to the life of the town, but both are in reality fugitives from justice. In both cases the character most affected by the arrival of the newcomer is a young woman. (The villain in "Shadow of a Doubt", Uncle Charlie, is played by Joseph Cotten, a frequent collaborator with Welles, although he does not appear in this film). "The Stranger" also features a cliff- hanging finale on a prominent building, in this case the local church tower, which seems very Hitchcockian. The town's 300-year-old clock atop the tower plays an important part in this film; Kindler, an obsessive clock enthusiast, is helping to restore it.One difference between "The Stranger" and "Shadow of a Doubt" is that in Hitchcock's film the young woman, Charlotte, is one of the first to realise that her Uncle Charlie is not all he seems. Here the woman involved is "Rankin's new wife Mary, the daughter of a Supreme Court Justice, and she is one of the last to realise, continuing to believe in her husband's innocence when everyone else has been convinced of his guilt. I felt that Loretta Young, 33 when the film was made, was miscast and that a younger actress could have presented Mary's obvious naivety more convincingly. Teresa Wright was much better as Charlotte.Welles' original idea was for the investigator charged with tracking Kindler down to be a woman, and suggested Agnes Moorehead for the role. His idea was not accepted by the studio and the investigator, Mr. Wilson, was eventually played by Edward G. Robinson. Although Robinson gives a decent performance I felt that the story might have seemed fresher and more original had Welles' suggestion been accepted; women were less likely to be cast in this sort of active role in the forties than they would be today. Welles himself is very good as Kindler/Rankin, always hinting at the war criminal underlying his affable schoolmaster persona. There is one particularly effective scene when Rankin gives himself away during a political argument, although he is nominally advocating an anti-Nazi position. What alerts Wilson is when Rankin states that because Karl Marx was Jewish he therefore was not German, but in fact the whole tenor of his speech is essentially fascistic. It is little more than a mirror- image of Nazi ideology, substituting a bigoted Germanophobia for the Nazis' own anti-Semitism. (In fact, it is little different from the sort of thing right-wing British, French and American nationalists were spouting to justify their countries' participation in World War I).Trying to evaluate the film is difficult, because I am aware that it is not the film which Welles intended to make. He did not have full artistic control over the project, and he and the studio did not see eye to eye about what the film should look like. What we see today essentially represents the studio's vision, a taut, fast-moving, relatively short thriller. Welles seems to have wanted to make a longer, more-character-driven disquisition on the nature of evil, including a lot more material. As far as I am aware no "Director's Cut" exists, and indeed some of the extra scenes which Welles wanted to include were excised from the script before they could even be shot. (Others were indeed shot but not used in the final version).Welles's direction, making much use of long takes, oblique angles and deep shadows, gives a distinctive feel to the film; its look reminded me of a later film from the late forties, "The Third Man". Welles, of course, acted in that film, although he did not direct it; possibly its director, Carol Reed, may have been influenced by his work. His direction also brings a sense of urgency and tension to the film. We do not know what Welles' version would have looked like had it been realised, but seen simply as a thriller "The Stranger" is a reasonably good one. 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun 'hunt the Nazi' thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THE STRANGER is a fine little film noir from 1946, directed by and starring Orson Welles. The narrative tells the timely story of the hunt for a chief Nazi official who's fled Germany at the end of the Second World War and is now hiding out in the USA. Can an investigator track down his foe before he disappears for good? It's an intriguing story and one that benefits from a strong sense of time and place; the plotting is just about plausible after all. Welles relishes the villainous role he has a chance to play and the film as a whole is very well directed with lots of atmosphere and suspense. The tough Edward G. Robinson always makes for a dependable protagonist as well. Things slow down quite a fair bit for a slightly stodgy middle section, which is more about a doomed romance than real thrills, but it certainly picks up for an unforgettable high rise climax.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a general rule, anything connected to Orson Welles is going to be good. Also as a general rule, if he appears in one of his movies, he'll play the villain. Case in point, The Stranger, which is top notch, and features Welles as a Nazi war criminal. And no, I didn't just give away the ending, only the beginning.Nazi bigwig Franz Kindler has destroyed all ties to his past, created a new identity for himself as New England college professor Charles Rankin, and found himself a beautiful bride. But all this is threatened when a former colleague comes to find him, with government detective Mr. Wilson (Edward Robinson) on his heels. Soon Wilson begins to suspect Rankin's true identity, and it becomes a tense cat and mouse game as Wilson looks for proof while Kindler/Rankin takes ever greater steps to destroy any connection, no matter what the cost.The plot is pretty straightforward, with only a few unexpected twists, but where it really gets you is the tension. You know what the good guy and the bad guy are planning, but you don't know who's going to act first, or who's gonna get hurt when they do. And knowing all the clues, you can't wait for the detective to find them. The chills really pick up towards the end, as Wilson plays an extremely dangerous game in hopes of flushing out his quarry.Just as important to the movie's success is the quality of the acting, which is first rate. In all his roles, Robinson is mild-mannered, soft-spoken, sympathetic, and knows a lot more than he lets on. As Detective Wilson he easily convinces the town that he's merely a kindly antiques dealer, even as he bluntly tells a man that he intends to put his daughter in harm's way. Equally brilliant is Loretta Young as Rankin's wife. The shock and disbelief when she discovers she married a monster and the breakdown as she struggles to come to terms with the truth are masterfully conveyed. And boy does she know how to get angry! Still, it probably goes without saying that the best work in The Stranger is done by Welles. He is the epitome of a man with two lives. To the public he appears calm and friendly. But in private, and in the presence of Wilson, you can sense his fear and desperation. The tone of his voice and the halting in his words give him away. And his eyes; nobody has ever had eyes that say as much as Welles's do. And his ruthlessness when the facade drops is something to behold. His best scene comes in the first half, when he gives a speech regarding his opinion of the German people, given delicious double meaning because we know he's describing himself.In closing I will admit that The Stranger isn't quite perfect. It could have been a bit more complex, and I thought that the judge would have been more taken aback by a certain piece of information. And there's also a visit from our old friend the climbing villain. But these are minor complaints. It may not be Citizen Caine or The Third Man, but the Stranger is still a solid thriller, well worth looking up.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why do the pretty gals always fall for . . .</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>. . . psychotic Nazi Holocaust architects who poison their girlhood pets? That's the question Orson Welles explores in his 1946 character study, THE STRANGER. Loretta Young as a Supreme Court Justice's daughter "Mary Longstreet" is the chick on the hot seat here. Welles contends that a man capable of master-minding the brutal slaughter of a six million member ethnic group must be quite charming to the ladies. When a tough decade for the Third Reich ends in total surrender, such a guy would have no trouble slipping into America to teach history at a tony New England prep school, Welles suggests. Romancing the most eligible Junior Miss in town would be a breeze for such a gent. Why not conduct genocide one year, and spend the next beating a small-town gossip at checkers? If this sounds implausible, don't forget that the bloke behind CITIZEN KANE also fronts THE STRANGER. Surely THAT'S a bigger gulf than the contrast between Welles' characters here. THE STRANGER may be Orson's most Hitchcockian flick, but it features all of his signature camera angles and monochromatic shadow shots. Don't be a stranger to this film.</fullReview>

Wilson must use all his detective skills to smoke out the Nazi within this idyllic America.Directed by Orson Welles, this has his great b/w style playing with shadows and imaginative camera angles early on. Then it's about the acting battle between Robinson and Welles. The story is simplistic. It allows the two leads to shine without distractions. The main deficit is that there isn't any mystery. It would be better to keep Kindler's identity a secret.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a unique film in the career of a master. Never before, and never after this one, would Welles accept to direct a movie without at least the promise/illusion of full creative control over it. Here he is merely the action/cut guy, and he knew it first hand. He accepted this commission after the logistic disaster of 'It's all true', when his image was, for the first time, hitting a low in Hollywood. I imagine he wanted to keep a foot in the industry, in the resources that had gave him so many possibilities in Kane. So he accepted doing as a director, what he would do the rest of his life as an actor: to act in pedestrian projects, to pay the rent and his real work as a master filmmaker. That stuff about him being a crazy who worked to pay for his own work.So any serious Welles student, and for that matter any serious film-goer, will come to this film trying to see the master magician perform his magic. But he will be eluded. There's no mastery here, mere above the level competence. The script is pretty good according to the context and current standards in its day. The nazi stuff may have given it an edge in its moment, the war had been over for only a year or so when this came out.But my life as a film goer overlaps Welles life as a filmmaker to a very important extent. I'm working myself on a personal project related to the unseen masterpiece The other side of the wind. So this is sort of a saltless meal for me. A waste of time, of resources. A complete stupidity to put Welles in front of a camera, but not in front of the whole game.We do have some interesting sequences, or rather shots, though. The very first opening shot is quiet wellesian in the plain visual sense that was valid then: the shot begins in the back of Robinson's head, and than opens without cuts, with a back dolly shot, to a room full of people. We have the initial sequence with the religious nazi surrogate deliberately escaping. Those are atmospheric shots, interesting sequences. We have the clock tower, powerful as a metaphor and as a space (check the stairs and how Welles frames it).But mostly we have a total lack of twists, of master touches. We have an absent master, nothing that would hint us that we are actually watching a film by an inventor, someone who deeply changed how we dream, feel, live. What a waste, what a tragedy.My opinion: 3/5http://www.7eyes.wordpress.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Remarkable Director, once again, swims upstream with this supposedly and often mislabeled "mainstream" film that is as offbeat as it gets in the Hollywood of the 1940's. The film has a production that is pure Wellesian even though he virtually disowned it. It is not complex in story, it is rather pedestrian, but that's where the capitulation ceases. It is shot with a darkness that befits the subject matter and includes many touches you just won't find in a typical movie of its time. It has an ominous tone and a relentless residue of the post-war angst and anger directed at the evil wanna be empire. There is a shroud of the sinister draping the drama and it has quick pacing and a cynicism only found in the best Film-Noirs. The Director could do so much with so little and often times, left alone, could be counted on to aspire to greatness. Sometimes achieving, sometimes not. So many of his films are so different and have an air of over accentuation that one is left with admiration and vexation . An uneasiness that says...that's too much...but give me more. An artist's dream.Beware of Public Domain prints that are awful transfers. This film demands clear viewing to appreciate in full.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Welles's Most Traditional Film: Easy to Devour, But Not Filling Enough for a Full Meal</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The rare Orson Welles film to turn a profit during its theatrical run, this is also his least favorite work due to constant studio meddling. The Stranger is more mainstream and digestible than most of his films, with a short running time and direct, hand-holding plot that leaves nothing for interpretation. In many ways that's refreshing, as Welles was often a candidate for getting caught up in himself and indulging in long, dry elaborations on non-central themes. Here we get just a taste of that, in one fantastic dinner table diatribe on the mentality of a Nazi, which benefits from both its brevity and special status as the flick's only real soapbox moment. The plot would have been greatly improved with a bit more ambiguity, though, as it spells everything out in the first act and sits back to watch the pieces fall naturally into place. That left me with a bland taste in my mouth and a starved imagination, dancing with visions of blown potential. Orson never shot an ugly picture, and this is no exception: it's a gorgeous example of extreme noir contrast and creative cinematography. A pity the base, predictable plot doesn't live up to the expectations.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Sprat To Catch A Mackerel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Stranger" is a fast moving and intriguing thriller about an operation to hunt down a Nazi war criminal who takes on a new identity and relocates to the United States. It was made at a time in Orson Welles' career when he needed to prove that he was capable of completing a project on time and within a set budget. A disciplined approach ensured that he achieved what he set out to do and this movie became his biggest box office success.Welles was widely quoted as saying that he regarded this as his worst movie and maybe this contributed to it being as under appreciated as it has been over the years since its initial release. Whilst it's not in the same class as "Citizen Kane" or "Touch Of Evil", there is still a great deal to commend it, as it has a good story, some fine performances and plenty of suspense. The often tense atmosphere is enhanced by the use of some disconcerting camera angles, close-ups and expressionistic cinematography and the movie's overall visual style is recognisably Wellesian.Shortly after World War 11, an American agent named Wilson (Edward G Robinson) persuades the Allied War Crimes Commission to allow a Nazi prisoner to escape in the hope that he'll lead them to a notorious war criminal called Franz Kindler (Orson Welles). The plan works perfectly and the escapee, Konrad Meinike (Konstantine Shayne) soon leads Wilson to a small Connecticut town called Harper.Meinike contacts Kindler who works as a teacher at the local school on the same day that he's due to marry Mary Longstreet (Loretta Young) who's the daughter of a Supreme Court Justice. Kindler's now known as Professor Charles Rankin and becomes visibly anxious about Meinike's presence in the town. After Meinike tells him that he's certain he was followed to Harper, Kindler chokes him to death and buries his body in a nearby wood.Wilson is aware that Kindler is a clock enthusiast and immediately after his arrival in town reduces his list of suspects to one when he learns that Professor Rankin has been carrying out some repair work on the town's old church clock. Rankin's anxiety increases steadily as he becomes aware that Wilson is closing in on him and in his desperation to avoid Meinike's body from being discovered, kills Mary's dog.When Wilson becomes certain that Rankin is actually Kindler, he shows Mary some films of the Nazi concentration camps and informs her that Kindler was one of the architects of the Holocaust. She goes into a state of denial but later, Rankin tries to kill her and she comes to terms with the truth before a sequence of dramatic events at the church clock tower brings the story to its very dramatic and violent climax."The Stranger" develops from being a story about a routine investigation into a dual between a determined investigator and a cunning fugitive who still believed that Germany was awaiting the arrival of another Hitler. For this reason the quality of the performances by Robinson and Welles were vital to the movie's success and both actors are excellent in their roles.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Review for History of Cinema</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>as this was the first orson welles movie i was unsure what to expect, i was amazed. first off i think the actors played their roles superbly, especially Orson Welles as Prof. Rankin, his eyes are always so creepy and suspicious. I also think that he combines a dramatic and suspenseful feeling throughout the film. He likes to leave the audience guessing. Not giving much backstory early on and then slipping it in later on thus connecting some confusing aspects to the plot that have already passed. In fact, you don't really find out what Rankin did as a Nazi soldier until at least half way through the film. I think the film was meant to be a reassurance to Americans that any Nazis who had disguised themselves and gotten into the states was being searched for and punished for war crimes. With this message laying guidelines for the film a great, drama was created.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Stranger</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In Harper, Connecticut, a notorious Nazi lives, masquerading as an American history professor, Charles Rankin(Orson Welles)recently marrying a prominent Supreme Court Justice's daughter, Mary Longstreet(Loretta Young). His life, as perfectly established as it may seem, falls off the tracks when an old comrade from the Third Reich returns to preach the word to him, Konrad Meinike(Konstantin Shayne) having converted to Christianity after a stint in prison, released reluctantly by a commission out to find and punish Nazi war criminals who have escaped into America. A Nazi Hunter, Mr. Wilson(Edward G Robinson) follows Meineke to Harper, and, in turn, is led to Rankin, preparing to set up a trap to, once and for all, seize upon a slippery, elusive murderer, using his wife as unfortunate bait.Considered by film buffs and cineasts as Orson Welles most "Hollywood" film(..it's more straightforward and less mythic in it's presentation), "The Stranger" is more or less a cat and mouse thriller, a battle of strategic wits, set amongst the backdrop of a quaint, quiet, continental town where all the locals know each other.Actually, "The Stranger" feels more like a Hitchcockian suspensor than an Orson Welles melodrama, the setting and scenario very familiar in regards to villains ably hiding underneath their masks, shielding who they really are from those around them. Orson Welles successfully presents a man whose cunning is manipulating his pretty wife into believing one lie after another, who Meinike is to him and why he had to kill the man, creating an elaborate back story that couldn't be further from the truth. Eddie G is perfectly cast as a dogged pursuer, very skilled in the job of catching the enemies who have grafted themselves into American society, a determined "detective" who has made a living at hunting and finding evil wherever it may be. Young is the film's dramatic arc, a woman who loves a man that could be an infamous psychopath, responsible for the slaughter of countless lives, having a difficult time accepting that her husband could be such a fiend. She's Wilson's chess piece, the only means to secure a long sought after war criminal, and her life is at stake..Wilson needs Mary in order to corner a desperate Rankin who would rather kill her than have his wife implicate him.The film's iconic image is the clock tower which plays a heavy part in how the story unfolds..it is used in many ways, such as how it ties Rankin to his past(..Rankin destroyed all things that tied him to the German Nazi), is used as a refuge from stress, a means for hiding, and possibly as a weapon(..a dangerous ladder that leads to the top of the tower).The finale is quite impressive as Rankin awaits Mary and Wilson, at the top of the clock tower, and his true benevolence emerges as he's a cornered animal with limited options left at his disposal. I think the film's best moments show the dark side of Rankin, how that Nazi still remains lurking, and the way Welles allows us to see him(..the dialogue also establishes this such as Rankin's dinner table conversation regarding how the German will not change with the times, the scribbling of the swastika on a notepad in a phone booth, his talk with Meinike about how the Nazi's would rise again, etc)when others aren't around him where his guard is down.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A pretty good movie with some definite flaws</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Overall, I enjoyed this movie. I thought it started out a bit slow, but by the end of the movie I was riveted to the screen.I thought Orson Welles gave a wonderful performance. He was just chilling and conveyed so much with just his eyes. He was terrifying.My problems with the movie are a bit nit picky.First, the musical score was awful. It was obviously trying to build suspense, but I found it horribly distracting because it was so loud. A softer score of the same music would have done a much better job of building suspense.My nit pick with the story is why a man plotting the murder of his wife would write down such a detailed time line. Maybe I've watched too much Law and Order here in the modern world, but that just made no sense to me. They could easily have gotten his time line from the pad of paper he used. Then again, maybe law enforcement didn't think that way back in the 40's so he wouldn't have been found out.Loretta Young was, as always, simply stunning. I thought her performance was also wonderful and I think my problems with the character of Mary have to do with the story and not with Young's performance. At the party, Mary had a breakdown and became overly emotional. Yet, at the end of the movie (after witnessing the violent death of her husband after he expressed desire to kill her), she was absolutely calm. That seemed inconsistent to me.All in all, I enjoyed the picture. Especially Welles' performance.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>***SPOILERS** One of the few motion pictures, directed and stared in, by Orson Wells that actually made money for the studio that financed it. "The Stranger" was also the most disliked film that Orson Wells ever directed In him feeling that he had to make it in order to prove his bank-ability to the studios. Where at the same time compromise his great artistic talents in order to make the film successful and acceptable to the movie going public; who for years felt that Wells' films were way over their heads for them to both grasps and understand.Having escaped Justice by slipping into the sleepy little Connecticut town of Harper fugitive Nazi war criminal Franz Kindler, Orson Wells, has in less then a year become a pillar of the community. Taking the name of Charles Rankin and becoming a full-fledged history professor at the Harper School for Boys things couldn't look better for the on the lamb Nazi war criminal. With him now about to marry Mary Longstreet, Loretta Young, who's father Adam, Philip Merivale, just happens to be a United States Supreme Court justice.Nazi hunter Mr. Wilson, Edward G. Robinson, working for the Allies War Crimes Commission decides to allow one of Kindler's cohorts and fellow Nazi war criminal Konrad Meinike, Konstantin Shayne, to escape from allied custody in Germany. Mr Wilson hopes that he'll eventually lead him to Kindler.Meinike a reformed Nazi and now replacing his fanaticism for the Hitler Regime with Christianity is a loose cannon as well as paranoid and dangerous psycho! In him feeling that Mr. Wilson is an agent of the Devil not of the US State Department. Getting to the town of Harper Meinike noticing Mr. Wilson stalking him ends up bopping Wilson over the head, from behind, in the high school gymnasium almost cracking his skull.This act of desperation on Meinike's part not only enrages Wilson but alerts him that the elusive Franz Kindler is somewhere holed up in town! Melinlke later finds his comrade in arms, and war crimes, Franz Kindler now being the respectable Prof. Charles Rankin! Meinike gets on Kindler's nerves by not only being able to identify him but his annoying sermonizing in trying to convince him about saving his soul and accepting Jesus as his Lord &amp; Saviour! Kindler sick of Meinike trying to convert him to Christianity shuts the gabby old nut up by strangling him. Kindler, in hiding the evidence of his crime, then buries Meinike in the woods where, he hoped, nobody would find him.As luck would have it Kindler's new bride's, Mary Longstreet, dog Red found where Melinike was buried leading Kindler to poison the mutt to both keep him quite and from sniffing up evidence. Which can very well lead him to ending up dancing at the end of a rope! All these efforts to keep the law from finally catching up with Kindler fell apart a few days later when he was having dinner with his wife Mary and company. One of the dinner guests just happened to be Mr. Wilson who's been masquerading around town as a clock expert. It's here that Kindler/Rankin showed his Nazi tendencies by innocently mentioning that the father of modern Communism Karl Marks was not German but in fact Jewish! This had an attentive Mr. Wilson suspect that Rankin was the man, Franz Kindler, he's been looking for all these months. The fact is that Marks, an atheist, didn't consider himself either German or Jewish but an Internationalist as well as champion of the working class!As Wilson starts to tie all the loose ends together in proving that Prof.Rankin is indeed Nazi fugitive Franz Kindler his life as well as those of Mary and her brother Noah, Richard Long, become endangered. In Kindler sinister attempting to shut them up, if they ever suspect who he is, and keep them from exposing him to the proper, the Allies War Crime Commission, authorities! And thus end up getting everything that he so rightfully deserves!As the noose tightens around Kindler's neck he make a final effort to escape justice in of all places the town's church bell-tower. It was there the he earlier tried to murder his wife Mary and almost ended up killing both Mr. Wilson and Noah! But this time around his long and unbroken string of luck just happened to ran out. ****SPOILER ALERT**** The spectacular final has Kindler's in a life and death struggle with Mr.Wilson in the church bell-tower that's some 100 feet up in the air. The fight finally comes to an end with Kindler not being done in by Mr. Wilson but the church's cuckoo clock that he so loved and nurtured, spending all his free time with it, so much.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No stranger to outside interference</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm half way through a recent biography of Orson Welles, "Despite the System" and felt it long overdue I view for the first time this overlooked and from this evidence underrated thriller from just after the war. All of what you'd hope and expect of Welles is present and correct, unusual camera angles, dolly shots from on-high, tracking shots, atmospheric settings, intriguing dialogue, all revolving around a credible, in fact award-winning story line about a brutal Nazi officer's migration and absorption into Smalltown America, who takes extreme steps to protect the revealing of his identity from a former underling, freed by the authorities just for that purpose. Of course, being a Welles' Hollywood film, the film appears hacked about with more than a few unusual juxtapositions and anachronisms in the narrative, but the story is strong enough and the telling good enough to pull it through. There are more than a few directorial flourishes to savour, aside from the usual visual treats, I was particularly taken with the means with which Welles gives away the true nature and background of the central character which he himself portrays, for instance the casual remark at dinner table that "Marx wasn't a German, he was a Jew" and the subliminal doodling of a swastika whilst making a phone call. The set-pieces (the "paper-chase" murder of his one-time confederate in the grounds of the church, the death scene atop the clock tower) are still great to behold and easily bear comparison with thriller-masters Hitchcock and Lang, both of whom had more budget as well as artistic control over their films. Consider this, along with "The Lady From Shanghai" and "A Touch of Evil" and it's obvious Welles could have joined their pantheon if he'd concentrated solely in this genre. Of the actors on show here, Edward G is as solid and credible as usual as the pursuing G-Man, Loretta Young's part, whilst well-played, seems worst affected by the enforced cuts and it was interesting to see a young Richard Long in an early part. Central though to the casting is Welles' own commanding performance of masquerading malevolence. The more one reads of Welles' butchery at the hands of the studio system, the more frustrated one gets at the sheer waste of what was obviously a towering talent, nay, genius, of the cinema.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Welles' weakest is still very good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is regarded as Welles' worst. Well, that's fantastic. Because it really is a very good movie. The way Welles uses the lights and the expressional lighting. His camera angles, and even the overall acting simply work.In the end, the lack of close ups are not missed, because it's as if it were up to the audience to choose whether they would take the good guys for good guys and the bad guys for bad guys. It's undoubtable that Welles wanted to portray Nazism as evil, but in the end it's up to the audience.It's the theatrical ways of Welles which reappear in this movie that give a not-so-original plot. And still it's one to see if you like Welles.The strongest element - Welles and everything he had to do in it.The weakest element - The storyline and plot WATCH FOR THE MOMENT - When Kimmler lies to his wife about the man he murdered. She believes him. She hugs him. Both are covered by a black shadow. Both are partners in crime.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Who Says Fear of Terrorism Is a Contemporary Problem</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Who says that fear of terrorism is a new development, post 9/11. Imagine the fears and exposed nerve endings of the average towns person living in the shadow of World War II. There was the fear of infiltration by the Nazis with their secret agents, blending in with our everyday citizens. Orson Welles plays just such a guy. He is kind, pleasant, quiet, and very dangerous. He even sets about marrying a woman as part of his secret plot. Edward G. Robinson, who normally would have been the heavy, plays a tired, hard working investigator who is leaving no stone unturned. The plot is intricate, though predictable, and the whole thing is hard to take your eyes off. Welles was a great director, but perhaps an even better actor. He keeps this thing going, raising it above the common fair of the time. The writing keeps the good guys at bay, but the clues continue to sit there, ripe for discovery. The clock tower is a great symbol, continuing to remind us of the urgency of everything. The dramatic irony presented makes us continually uncomfortable. We are treated to the movements and activities of the villain, and being let in, it makes everything more enjoyable. See this if you can.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Orson Welles-Edward G. Robinson-Loretta Young in an artful thriller directed by Welles</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie must of made more than one actual former Nazi on the lamb a little nervous that people might actually start tracking them down. And in the 60th anniversary year of this film's release there still are a few on the loose out there. This one of my favorite Edward G. Robinson performances as Mr. Wison the federal agent tracking the Nazi war criminal. Orson Welles directs himself as Professor Rankin, the Nazi who has assimilated himself into quaint New England society. Loretta Young rounds out the principal cast as Mary Longstreet as Rankin's unsuspecting fiancé. It must have been tough being Orson Welles especially in the immediate years following Citizen Kane where as he would come out with a quality film like this people would still use Kane as a benchmark and say well, it's not Kane. This film is adapted from a story by Victor Trivas who himself was forced to flee first Germany and then France to the USA from the Nazi regime. I've seen this several times over the years and have enjoyed this film and would give it a 8.0 of a possible 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unheralded thriller from Orson Welles</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While "The Stranger" isn't Welles' finest film, there are certainlymany elements within to make it memorable.The story revolves around a War Crimes agent (Edward G.Robinson) searching out the identity of a former Nazi responsiblefor many of the atrocities committed during the holocaust (OrsonWelles). His investigation leads to a small town in Connecticut,where he discovers a suspicious newlywed school teacher withone identifying characteristic: An obsession with clocks. Much ofthe movie is Robinson's struggle to uncover and prove Welles' trueidentity, leading to an epic finale atop a clocktower."The Stranger" is based on previously published material, butWelles goes a long way to make the movie his own. As a director,Welles knew how to compose a shot, and "The Stranger" featuressome great camera work. Particularly interesting to me was theuse of mirrors to convey Welles' dual role as respected teacher,mentor and husband ... and as a Nazi executioner, and torturer.Also in the plot there's an on-going checkers game betweenRobinson and the owner of a local general store. During the finalact, Welles plays checkers all afternoon with this fellow to use asan alibi. Though I can't say for sure, I'm going to assume that thecheckers games are symbolic of Robinson's pursuit of Welles.Most consider Welles' first movie, "Citizen Kane" to be not only hisgreatest achievement, but also one of the greatest Americanmovies ever to be made. I'll say nothing to refute that, but "CitizenKane" also led to Welles' undoing. Could he possibly ever top thescale and brilliance of Kane?It's hard to say. Personally, I enjoyed his adaptation of Kafka's "TheTrial," starring Anthony Perkins. In it, Welles attempts to fit in thatepic scale of "Citizen Kane" with Kafka's subversive plot and storyof a man standing accused for a crime he cannot comprehend. It'sWelles at his audacious best.But I digress.All in all, "The Stranger" is a great movie for a quiet evening spentat home. As a double feature, try this movie along with "The LadyFrom Shanghi," starring Welles and his ex-wife Rita Hayworth.Another great film noir, though it suffers from extreme studioediting.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Stranger" is not by any means Orson Welles' worst film. "F is for Fake" would probably earn that title. It is one of his least ambitious--there's very little of the wild technical inventiveness featured in "Citizen Kane"--but taken on its own terms it's an engrossing thriller. The acting is superb, the action moves briskly, and there are many wonderful moments. Welles' monologue at the dinner table on "the German" is remarkable. My favorite Welles touch is a moment of black humor. SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER Franz Kindler (Welles) is using a public phone booth. He picks up a pencil meant for notetaking in the phone booth and, while talking, idly doodles a swastika on the wall. Realizing what he's done, he obscures it. END SPOILER END SPOILER END SPOILER It's too bad that people knock "The Stranger" by comparing it to masterpieces like "Kane" or "Touch of Evil" instead of taking it for what it is: a crackling suspense film that is well worth a look.</fullReview>

How seared his conscience has become is evident in how easily he strangles someone he has known from Germany, so that he himself is not discovered. The most interesting development of the story is how (Loretta Young) the new wife of the imposter is changed from sweetness to willingness to incriminate herself to finally having her own morale character resurface at the end...it seems to be more about her dilemma than just whether the imposter will be found out and exposed by the investigator, played by Edward G.

		<shortDescription>A Very Well Executed Spy Thriller From Orson Welles.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Orson Welles's The Stranger (1946) has no "hidden message" or great "symbolism". It's just a damn good "yarn" of the Spy Thriller genre. This film is very well crafted in all aspects. The acting, particularly by Orson Welles, Edward G Robinson, and Loretta Young, was really great. In fact, the whole supporting cast gave the whole story a very convincing "small town" feel. Every role in this film, big and small, was cast and performed perfectly. Very believable and "tight" storyline with no fantastic coincidences, and no unexplainable "holes" in the storyline , and the story had just the right amount of plot twists. Robinson plays a very convincing "G-man", going undercover to catch a Nazi war criminal hiding incognito in a small Connecticut town. Being released in 1946, it was very topical to the post WWII era, before "Soviet aggression" reared its ugly head. This film is still a very exciting, compelling, and engaging film today, being a true spy thriller for the ages. The Stranger (1946) is Orson Welles at his best.{{This review is also posted at "Forum For Film Reviews And Discussions" at groups.google.com)}}</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worth the slow start</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Despite a slow warm-up, this film is worth the watch for quite a few reasons, the first being that it provides an interesting example of a really substantial female hero. Loretta Young's Mary is told by various characters that she's having a breakdown, but she never does, which is hilarious - instead she shows remarkable initiative and bravery for a mid-1940s female character and tracks down her evil husband, in the middle of the night, climbs a very long precarious ladder she knows to be suspect, and ends up shooting her husband several times. While Welles has other characters play with their own preconceptions of what a stereotypical female character should be, he's directed Young to hold her nerve in every scene - check out the scene where Rankin/Kindler tells her she should've climbed the ladder, instead of Noah (a wonderful turn from Richard Long).Edward G. Robinson is a joy to watch in anything, and in this he is delightful, compelling and has one of the best wisecracking final scenes of any postwar film.Welles hams it up deliciously, but I wonder if he later watched Hitchcock's Vertigo and saw a few reverberations from this film. Some of the significant suspense-laden shots of hands on the untrustworthy ladder rungs and many of the scenes in the church clocktower were obviously inspiration for Hitch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Nazi hunter Edward G. Robinson is hot on the trail of Nazi war criminal Orson Welles. He follows another Nazi to Connecticut, where he discovers Welles is living under an assumed name, working as a teacher, and newly-married to Loretta Young.Fascinating film noir thriller with a smart script, beautiful cinematography, and stylish direction from Orson Welles. The cast is first-rate. Welles' performance is positively hypnotic. I just couldn't tear my eyes away from him when he was on screen. Edward G. Robinson knocks his part out of the park, which should surprise no one familiar with this phenomenal actor's work. Loretta Young is fine, though slightly more melodramatic than her two big costars. The supporting players are all good but Konstantin Shayne is a scene stealer. It's historically interesting as it's the first mainstream American film to deal with the Holocaust and the idea that the Nazis still living should be tried for their crimes. After the war, most Americans were understandably ready to move on with their lives and put all the sordidness of the past several years behind them. But this movie highlighted that there were still Nazis out there, some even living in the US, never held accountable for their atrocities and capable of posing a threat to us in the future.It's a great film. A classic in every sense. The script is full of juicy dialogue. Welles and Robinson both have memorable speeches. The climactic clock tower scene is unforgettable. Any fan of Welles will no doubt love it. But really anyone who appreciates good film noir and suspense thrillers should find a lot to like about it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was one of the ones Welles made after Citizen Kane. And while made with a much smaller budget and none of the grand scope, it delivered a tautly delivered story.It begins with an investigator of war crimes after World War II letting a convicted Nazi out of his cell on the hope he will lead him to a higher ranking Nazi who has escaped justice. The chase leads to a town in New England, where said Nazi has blended in as a teacher and married the daughter of a Supreme Court Justice.The movie takes on an air of cat and mouse as the investigator and the Nazi try to outwit each other, putting the new bride in the middle of it. There is also this theme around clocks and a clock tower the Nazi is trying to restore because he is obsessed with clocks.It includes some great cinematography, Welles was way ahead of his time on that score. Robinson hands in a great performance here, a departure from his caricature of a gangster.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Review for The Stranger</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The stranger was an alright film, nothing to spectacular, but I did enjoy it. It was my first Orson Wells film so I was expecting something very impressive, however that could be my own fault because I did pick one of his less popular films. Despite other opinions I have heard about this film I thought it illustrated an intriguing story supported by great acting which was mostly demonstrated by Orson Wells himself. The story took a historical issue and combined it with action and mystery keeping the audience's attention while creating suspense and interest. The story only had a few moments where I felt it was a little dragged out and over dramatized, but overall it was very strong; until the ending. I feel as if Orson Wells got tired of filming so he quickly killed of the antagonist and the day was saved at once so he decided it was time to cut the film. I supposed this was a resolution to the problem and a conclusion to the story, but I feel it was undeveloped and could have had some more detail and closure included.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>In Harper There Is Nothing To Be Afraid Of.....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Orson Welles' dark and atmospheric thriller set in the picturesque town of Harper not only provides intense viewing but plays on a deeper fear of the world not being so black and white.The Stranger's plot consists of an investigation headed by Mr Wilson looking for former Nazi Charles Rankin which leads him to the town of Harper. We soon learn Rankin's real name is Franz Kindler and he will go to great lengths to hide his true identity. From strangling a former friend to poisoning the family dog, Orson Welles gives a performance of a man who is equally cunning and callous making him a sinister antagonist. His rival Mr Wilson, conveyed with such determination and intellect by Edward G. Robinson battles Rankin in a game of wits, each attempting to figure out the other's move in order to survive. Placed into the mix is Rankin's new Wife Mary, a character not only used to enhance the drama by having conflicting feelings and loyalties but personifies the innocence of picturesque towns and the new hope of everyone following the war.Setting The Stranger in Harper was an ideal choice by Welles in shattering the mindset of this small communal town which is emblematic for the global community as well. Openly and frankly during a dinner conversation Rankin discusses with Mr Wilson the possibility of the German's raising up once more to take on the world. "Mankind is waiting for another Messiah, but for the German, the Messiah is not a Prince of Peace. He's another Barbarossa, another Hitler". No one but Mr Wilson, an outsider of the Harper community's innocence reflects upon Rankin's words after the dinner. It begins the recurrence of highlighting the blindness the Harper community has, in particular Mary have in not seeing Rankin's true intentions and even further the evilness which was thought to have perished with the Third Reich. Even after Rankin admits to Mary the murders he has committed she does not deter from him. She stays loyal almost to the bitter end after contemplating the facts in a versatile performance from Loretta Young, switching from loving devotion of her Husband to embittered by the truth, breaking down her small town innocence.The micro and symbolic aspects to The Stranger are handled with great results. The motif of low key lighting and shadows in the film's most atmospheric moments along with the musical score which is equally suspenseful and high in emotional tempo gives the narrative a dark feel. A clever touch by Welles which some may have missed is making Rankin an expert on clocks. This aspect relates to the narrative as Rankin fixes the town clock which the dongs begin to irritate Harper's citizens. "Harper was a nice, quiet place till it started banging" states a Harper resident. This has both a literal and figurative meaning, the latter being a metaphor of the evilness Rankin has brought to Harper whose citizens personified through Mary either are unaware of or at first chose to ignore.The Stranger is a film filled with dark overtones which can be rooted anywhere not matter how the place looks on the outside. This would have been a disturbing prospect back in 1946 for those who felt they had been freed from the horrors of a world war and a prospect which is still relevant today.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So predictably not what happened</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of those films that tried to show Nazi criminals being chased and hunted down after the war. Unluckily that was grandly nothing but propaganda. A great number of them did escape and survived decades before dying in their beds. Some were even recuperated by the allies, western or eastern allies, to become the spearheads of their armament industry during the Cold War. In this case Orson Welles does a nice job because he shows the Nazi as a hateful man, both full of hate and inspiring hate, from the very start, so that we wonder why a good family daughter could have fallen in love with him. Then Orson Welles builds a nice machine that is nearly as precise as a clock, the clock in the church tower. And in fact it so happens that it is the clock that is the main character that actually erase the criminal off the surface of the living. An unthankful ungrateful clock that kills the one who had repaired it. And there we are. We don't have to do anything with that criminal. I guess God took care of him. A little bit naive but a film that works rather well even if the suspense is limited to just enough for us to forget that the film has to have a good ending. It is a shame in a way that Orson Welles had to do such films that were nothing but cheap propaganda to accumulate the good points and the money he needed to do the very few real good ones we will remember him for. Orson Welles was never trusted enough to be able to use his genius and genial inspiration in films that could have changed the face of the cinema. But did any one want to change the face of the cinema? That is THE question.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne &amp; University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It struck me while watching "The Stranger" that this could have been an Alfred Hitchcock film, what with the clock tower motif and the stairs/ladder plot element, not to mention the Nazi connection with Hitch's "Notorious". Considering all that, there are a number of counterbalancing effects that prevent the film from being as great as it could have been. Orson Welles is believable up to a point as escaped Nazi war criminal Franz Kindler, masquerading as college professor Charles Rankin in a small Connecticut town. Yet his performance is uneven, with the cold calculating former Nazi virtually falling apart as he brings his new wife Mary (Loretta Young) up to speed regarding his criminal past. It's difficult to believe that the mastermind of the Nazi death camps would have so easily given himself away to face capture and punishment, let alone hang around for War Crime Commission czar Wilson (Edward G. Robinson) to put him away.At least Rankin had the good sense to avoid being seen after crawling around in the dirt following his dispatch of Meinike (Konstantin Shayne). But really, his absence from the entire wedding reception was never adequately dealt with, and Mary's reaction never got hostile the way a real newlywed would have. That was a neat touch with the preoccupied Rankin scribbling away at a Nazi swastika while setting up his wife for a quick exit.If you suspend critical judgment while watching, "The Stranger" winds up as a fair enough thriller, owing primarily to Robinson's character methodically working the town's citizens to help expose his victim. However it was with an unintended chuckle that I came away from the story, considering the way Rankin deliberately murdered his former associate; here in fact was the basis for the original Meinike muffler.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Weak Welles</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Robinson is a government agent out to nab Nazi war criminal Welles, who's been living in a small Connecticut town using a false identity. Robinson is terrific as usual whereas Welles is rather wooden as the villain. This was the second film for young Richard Long (The Big Valley). Director Welles makes the most of it but the script is weak, lacking focus. The relationship between Welles and Young is never believable; this can be blamed on the script as well as the two actors. Based on what we are shown about their relationship and given his dour character, it is hard to believe that she would stick with him after he confesses to being a killer. Welles has done better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The story is very intelligent for its time...a Nazi war criminal (Welles) lives incognito as a college professor in a small, peaceful Connecticut town, and a detective is hunting him down.Welles acting is, of course, superb, and a tense scene at a dinner table in which he rants intelligently about the possibility of Germans embracing democracy is reason enough to pick up this movie. The fact that we know he's a Nazi makes his monologue intricately suspenseful--will the detective pick up the hints that we, as an omniscient audience, are able to detect with relative ease? There's a little drugstore/coffee shop that the detective frequents throughout the movie in an attempt to gather information about the mysterious professor, and these scenes are charming and offer some slight comic relief that doesn't seem as dated as it should be.The finale is one that has been paid homage to numerous times in film history, and rightfully so. That said, the fact that we've seen so many references to it softens the effect of what was surely, at one time, a shocking scene.I recommend this, especially if you have little faith in the ability of older films to captivate. It's kind of short for this type of film (95 minutes), so excitement and intrigue are rarely absent.This movie made me want to watch Citizen Kane again--along with Touch of Evil and The Third Man.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's interesting that both Hitchcock and Welles, two of our most innovative and creative directors, chose films with such similar styles. While not as good as "Shadow of a Doubt" (and few thrillers are), "The Stranger" treads well on many of the same themes, specifically how small-town America of the 40s could be taken in so easily by evil in disguise. As many of the other reviewers have said, this is certainly not Welles' best work, but the performances by him, Loretta Young and especially Edward G. Robinson lift a pretty standard story to a quite entertaining level. And there are flashes of Welles' unique visual style throughout, from the paper chase in the beginning to the clocktower at the end. All in all, a fun film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While not Welles best, "The Stranger" is entertaining and has a great look. What is most interesting is the crossover between Welles and Hitchcock as much of both story and style are borrowed from "Sabotage". Hitchcock would later borrow original elements from "The Stranger" for use in "Vertigo" - so apparently the two directors came out even.The nontechnical highlights of this film are the performances of Edward G. Robinson and Loretta Young. Young is especially amazing, she plays Sylvia Sidney's role from "Sabotage" and is literally and figuratively the star-with more lines and screen time than Welles. Also entertaining is drug store owner "Mr. Potter" played by Billy House; who is always ready for a game of checkers which he plays wearing an eye shade while shamelessly cheating.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's hard to review an Orson Wells film that does not carry the cinematic weight and notoriety of classics such as "The Third Man" and "Citizen Kane". Nevertheless, this movie is good. Very good. I wondered while viewing it if Welles had taken a page from early Hitchcock ("The 39 Steps").Welles plays a former Nazi trying to escape war crime trials by changing his identity and hiding out in an unassuming small Connecticut town. His marriage to the unaware and naive Loretta Young is the meat of the film, with great support from FBI investigator Edward G. Robinson and some humorous and entertaining scenes with general store owner "Mr. Potter" played by Billy House. Welles uses some interesting camera shots and film sequences (no surprise there). The ending is both suspenseful (again, in a sort of "Hitchcock-ian" way) but at the same time unconvincing and almost amusing. Welles apparently hated this film, but I recommend it.</fullReview>

The people here can't begin to imagine the evil that occurred a world away ("I've never seen a Nazi"), making it that much easier for Kindler to escape suspicion. Only Wilson (Edward G Robinson) knows what Kindler is capable of; and Kindler's evil appears that much more profound when contrasted with the simpleminded good-naturedness of the townfolk.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Stranger Within Orson Welles</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You can never be too sure of the person you're sharing your life with. This is something Mary Longstreet (Loretta Young) comes to realize in Orson Welles' tight but not groundbreaking noir thriller THE STRANGER. The story of an Overall Mysterious Guy Who Looks Too Good To Be True when he moves into a small town has the novelty of an dated drama, but under Welles' hand the material looks and feels quite dark and moody where it should even when it overreaches its own weight at other points. Even so, there are many good moments in it, the story has tight editing, tight pacing, and clocks in at a little over 90 minutes while delivering the goods. That it was also a commercial success restored some of the lustre into Welles' career as a film director who could bring in a film on time and under budget as accounts go. It would have been an interesting thing though, for the time, if Agnes Moorehead would have performed the part that went to Edward G. Robinson -- to have a woman play a part that was so physically demanding would have raised its relevance up a notch with the eventual rise of feminism. As it is, Robinson is left with a part that is a repeat of his role in DOUBLE INDEMNITY but one that gave him one more brownie point in his portrayal of sympathetic supporting roles which distanced himself even more from his earlier roles as gangsters. For the most part, the acting is on target -- Welles plays one of his many forays into dark characters who look placid on the surface. Young is the damsel in distress who has to utter one of the most ridiculous lines in movie history: "Kill me. Kill me, I want you to. I couldn't face life knowing what I've been to you and what I've done to Noah. But when you kill me, don't put your hands on me!" And does one better by picking none other than a fireplace poker, handing it to Welles, and screaming: "Here, use this!" I could almost picture Welles, who always had this enigmatic, casual smirk on his face, saying, "Okie-dokie!" One interesting bit is how Young manages to look like a dead ringer for Joan Crawford did at the time (and made me wonder if she'd do better than Young does here), but that's an observation not related to this movie. Other than that, the climax is quite a nail-biter atop a clock tower, and proof that Welles still had it as a visual director able to deliver a solid 90 minutes of entertainment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"dry noir"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While it contains some inventive visual flourishes and a brooding atmosphere bathed in shadow, "The Stranger" comes off as a rather dry exercise in film noir aesthetics. Orson Welles plays a Nazi war criminal living in America, teaching at a prestigious college, and arranged to marry Loretta Young, daughter of a prominent politician. In a great performance, Edward G. Robinson is the DC detective out to rein in Welles and his ilk. While the subject matter is rather daring for its time (the film was released in 1946), it is dated by today's standards, and the machinations of the plot putter along rigidly. Save for some striking imagery, it's difficult to get worked up over "The Stranger"'s final outcome.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An underrated film; interesting historical look</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A lot of this film is misunderstood due to the day and age in which we live at. When it was released there was NO television and newspapers simply would not print, for reasons of 1940s taste, the photos taken of the concentration camps and the victims of that terror. This film, released shortly after WWII, was the first time most Americans saw actual film footage of the concentration camp horrors. These scenes are certainly old news today but back then the scenes were very disturbing. And, could therefore led to Americans wondering if there were, indeed, former Nazis hidden in the United States. This film shows the ultimate paranoia- a highly placed member of the Third Reich hidden in a tranquil, semi-paradise, town in New England- even married to a daughter of an esteemed local jurist. People in 1946 seriously thought this was possible. Hence the reason why it is an interesting historical look at the times.Wells does not play the villain convincingly. He has not a hint of a German accent, yet the movie explains him coming from a German speaking country by having him mention that he is from Swizterland. The war has ended only shortly before; how could he have gotten a teaching job and integrated himself so well in the community in such a short time? How did he romance the daughter of such a respected jurist? Loretta Young is beautiful; she is obviously not desperate for any man- she can take her pick. The plot holes are obvious, but in 1946 the United States was paranoid about Nazi infiltrators; much like the United States is ultra paranoid about Islamic infiltrators.So, Orson was not a convincing villain. He was much better the next year as "Harry Lime" in the movie, "The Third Man". There he stunningly played a real life secret villain, Kim Philby. I think that in 1946 it was simply very hard to find a Grade A actor to play a Nazi; considering the sentiment at that time. Wells did the best he could with what he had to work with. Yes, Agnes Moorehead would have been great for the role that Edward Robinson plays, but Wells was too far ahead of his time. Having a woman portray a lead investigator in 1946 was simply something the audience would not accept nor believe. And, a middle aged Robinson was still very good even if he was not first choice. Lastly, I referred to Orson Welles being ahead of his time with the desire to use Agnes Moorehead as the lead investigator; actually he was ahead of his time in everything else in the movie industry. In a way, it is VERY frustrating to look at his films; knowing they were done in the film media. His techniques were actually best done in the digital media; which, unfortunately, was not available during his lifetime.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mixed feelings about this film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are things I like about this film...very much. And there are things I dislike about this film. Well, one thing I dislike about this film...and let's start with that.I think Orson Welles was a good actor. But not a great actor. I think Welles was a good director. But not a great director...or at least not consistently a great director. Lest you think it's just me, Bosley Crowthers said, "Mr. Welles, a young actor, doing a boyishly bad acting job..." I would go so far as to say he overacts a great deal here. Rating Orson Welles here -- as both actor and director -- I'd have to rate him only a C.On the other hand, two actors I admire I think do fine jobs here. I always liked Edward G. Robinson, but I rarely like a gangster film. So it's always a treat to see him in a different type of role. Now, some people blame Robinson for some of the odd things his character does here (like making an innocent woman the bait for a murder). But Robinson didn't write the script, nor did he direct the film. So I'll place that responsibility on Welles. Similar, I love seeing Loretta Young in a good film. She great here. Again, her character does some inane things, but that's the fault of the screenwriter and the director.Similarly, Richard Long turns in a good performance, although it seems highly unlikely that a detective would so confide in a young man as Robinson does Long. But again, Long is only responsible for his acting, not the script and direction.The story could have been handled much better. The plot suffers from some real issues that make parts of it seem incredible (and I mean that in the worst sense of the word). Nevertheless, it is entertaining. So I'll give it a weak "7".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The stranger is a very disappointing movie. It is necessary to recognize that it is an interesting movie, especially thanks to the originality of its scenario. This movie also has the merit to dare to approach the theme of the Nazism on a production intended for a wide public and it on only one year after the end of the Second World War. And to end with the positive points, Welles' knowledge of the cinematic techniques as well as his acting abilities make a very entertaining work. However, The stranger don't convince as much as Citizen Kane or The Trial. First, the print of the director is not very present and the movie thus seems very standardized. Orson Welles he even told to have had no freedom which he likes having for his movies. Welles was even until assert that it was his worst movie. Then, the character of Welles, an old Nazi, appears to me as more nice than Robinson', a policeman. I do not know if it ensues from acting abilities of each or from an egocentric will of direction but Welles seems to embody the hero of the movie while it is the "miserable". On the contrary, inspector Wilson more annoyed me than convinced in this movie. In conclusion, it is necessary to greet the scenario of the movie which offers a pleasant moment but the sensation of standardization spoils a little the story. The setting is rather commonplace with a miserable, a "hero", a woman in the center and the happy end. It is in any case not Orson Welles's best movie. 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Stranger" is Orson Welles lite, but it's still a blast! Nowhere nearly as formally or narratively complex as "Citizen Kane" or "The Magnificent Ambersons," "The Stranger" plays more like the kind of B noir films that flooded movie screens in the late 1940s. Welles plays a Nazi hiding under a false identity in a New England town, biding his time before the Reich will rise again. Loretta Young plays his fooled but not foolish wife, who discovers his dark secret and contributes to bringing him to justice. And Edward G. Robinson (was there ever a more delightful actor?) plays the investigator on the villain's trail.The film could serve as the poster child for a sub-genre of film noir, the innocent small town being corrupted by invidious forces from without. Much of the action, literally and thematically, is centered around the town's clocktower, which serves ably as a nifty setting for the film's nailbiting (and surprisingly gruesome) climax.The film takes on serious topics, but it manages to do so in that blackly comedic way that Welles, both as a director and actor, could pull off so well. You feel that he's taking the film seriously even as he's winking at you the whole time.Grade: A</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Superbly paced, well-plotted and directed Welles pic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film has it all - good acting, great direction, a great plot, and Welles' technical wizardry. It's not one of Welle's more famous movies like Ambersons or Kane or Touch of Evil but it's a great movie all the same. It might have been a "B-movie" but there's nothing lower quality about this film. The only thing lower about it might have been the budget because it was not made under the aegis of a studio. It is a Welles' film well-worth checking out.The film is about an escaped Nazi war criminal named Kindler (Welles) who is pursued by a War Crimes investigator named Wilson (Edward G. Robinson). Kindler was one of the planners of the Final Solution and eluded capture thanks to his aversion to publicity. He establishes a great cover for himself by securing a professorship in a leafy northeastern college town but Wilson allows another Nazi, Meinike (Konstantin Shayn) to be released, believing that he will attempt to find Kindler and will thereby bring Wilson to him. His hunch, not for the first time, proves correct. Kindler's cover as a college professor is so convincing, however, that the town has no idea about his true identity until strange things start happening in Harper.The audience becomes aware of Kindler's true nature from the beginning however, and so the suspense comes in the form of the pace at which the rest of the cast realizes it. The denouement is easily visible from the beginning but it doesn't make its fulfillment any less rewarding because Welles allows the tension to build steadily. Wilson becomes suspicious of Kindler quite early and finally share's his suspicions about the danger in which Kindler's wife (Loretta Young as Mary) is in to her brother, Noah (Richard Long). As Wilson becomes surer, he lets more people close to Mary in on the secret but won't tell her until he is absolutely sure Kindler's capture is imminent in order that she not be spooked. Welles slowly turns up the heat in this potboiler until finally the lid can't stay on anymore and it pops off. Such is the build-up and release of tension in this film.Edward Robinson is fantastic in his role as the determined, low-key detective. He is so low-key Kindler never sees him coming and is so dogged that once he gets a hint, he won't stop pursuing it until it proves a dead-end or correct. Robinson makes him very easy to root for. Also excellent is Billy House as Mr. Potter, the local drug-store clerk who is the clearinghouse for everything that happens in the small town. House makes him a little simple but charming enough that you might just spill enough beans that he can share with someone else and learn something important. Richard Long is very good as Noah, the innocent but caring younger brother of Kindler's imperiled wife. Once Robinson lets him in on his suspicions about Kindler, he responds compassionately and judiciously. Welles is great as a truly dastardly character whose evil Welles is able to convey with a serious demeanor and intensity. I found Loretta Young's performance overly melodramatic until she sinks her teeth into the final scene.Welles must get a lot of credit though for pacing the film just right and allowing the tension to build to its zenith until the balloon bursts and the chips fall. His use of symbolism and his technical virtuosity are all over the film via cinematographic choices which only increase the knuckle-clenching. I really highly recommend this film for its very good acting, direction, and plot.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>now this review wont be the greatest i have ever written... ill attribute that to the fact that i was writing out a shot by shot map of it as i was watching so frequent pauses and scribbling really took me out of the experience... however i still managed to get to gist of the film and understood the plot very well. a war criminal living incognito in small town middle America is being tracked by our pipe smoking hero... the photography was well done in my opinion the angles were never boring frequent use of crane shots and dramatic lighting really weighed on my opinion in the matter... i cant remember the music... probably a good thing if i don't notice it it probably fit really well.. thats how i approach music in general... the acting was good nobody seemed like they were acting... Orson Welles i wish did something towards the end as he was exposed used more of a German accent.. the picture quality was pretty good until about 2/3 of the way through the movie where the picture looked awful for one scene... it looked like it was shot in super 8 as opposed to cinema-scope.... its a well done movie a little slow moving in places but for the most part its always moving</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More Than Just the Middle-of-the-Road Compromise Between Shadow of a Doubt and The Third Man</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As an entire bracket of critics and scholars will tell you, when Orson Welles is behind the camera, it invariably appears to be in just the precise position to extract the apt power in the composition. As in preceding triumphs those scholars would much more readily mention, he uses shadow for especially ominous sequences, like near the end of this arguably minor effort, when the character he plays in front of his camera, awash in blackness, glimpses down a ladder. Or to augment a more delicate threat, like when his confused and scared wife pulls the shades to establish privacy. The Stranger was closer to the model of "a standard Hollywood picture" than the audacious, iconoclastic head trips that Welles surged into his preceding Kane and Ambersons. It replicates his idiosyncratic ideas of self-examination and self-destruction merely in framework.And that's where the film's status conflicts: Too many Welles academics see the film as run-of-the-mill. Though Welles himself, embittered by the grueling production experience, called the film unimportant, this still seems elitist and narrow-minded, because his helming of The Stranger is anything but commonplace. Unlike so many filmmakers who made great films, this man never slouched, and even his second-class works distinctly merit discovery by younger generations of film buffs. This was the first and only time that the intractably personal filmmaker directed a screenplay that was not his own, but this creative, very pleasing thriller is abounding with the many idiosyncratic strokes that set Welles aside from other filmmakers: his arresting deep-focus camera techniques, a dexterous multi-layered use of sound, handsomely suggestive performances, sly editing and baroque little details and minutiae in the decorous periphery of every scene and character, large and small, that clearly associated the film with its director. For instance, the tremendously long take through the woods capturing a suspenseful meeting between Kindler and an old colleague sits in immediate contrast with the town's archaic tower clock resurrecting mysteriously as the hour strikes.The Stranger doesn't quite function at the supreme altitude of Citizen Kane or Touch of Evil, and it's not quite as rich a work as the incomplete-in-principle Magnificent Ambersons. Some fantastic justification is often necessary to swallow the choices made by Charles, the mysterious figure at the center of this story. However, it builds suspense in a parallel way to Hitchcock's Shadow of a Doubt, using a woman's defenselessness and profound adoration as influence, to challenge fears and elude discovery, except in Welles' rendition, we see the truth from the start, while Shadow of a Doubt remains ambiguous till very late. Welles' film candidly tackles the Nazi regime's vicious hatred of Jews and their heritage, both in the fine gaffes of the tongue that in due course pinpoints Charles, and in the stark presentation of footage from the liberated camps, used to reveal him to his wife's family, which indicated the first time that Nazi carnage was included in a dramatic film. Though I feel Hitchcock's film is the superior one, The Stranger nevertheless similarly peels back picturesque Americana, complete with canny town clerks who pass the time by playing checkers and the thick air of idealized contentment in the face of such unaccustomed repulsions as concentration camps. It's not the least bit random that, as the fugitive's American wife in denial, the daughter of a Supreme Court justice interestingly enough, Loretta Young is ceaselessly drawing blinds.The performances, though the cast is entirely comprised of likable and even cherished stars and character actors, are nevertheless somewhat over pitched. But the tension in The Stranger is exceedingly assisted by Welles' technical sorcery. He flaunts all his visual rumbling for the chase finale, but the film's most striking scenes may be those that portray everyday living in the Connecticut township where lectures at a prep school. Swathed in snow, the surroundings have the charmed quiet of The Magnificent Ambersons. He also delivers a savory performance as Charles, as does the great Edward G. Robinson as the gutsy, pipe-smoking inspector fixed on exposing Charles' secret identity as a Nazi war criminal to Young and the rest of their peaceful little Connecticut town. In a sense, The Stranger is Welles' own inverted precursor to The Third Man, where he would play a sly fox stripped into a desperate rat much like here. It's certainly nowhere near the film that The Third Man is, and perhaps being stuck in public domain hell has prevented The Stranger from the exalted status of Welles' other works, but I suspect the younger generations of cinephiles will be partial to it as most of its exposure nowadays is through online streaming.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Harper, Connecticut is a quiet, peaceful neighborhood, where nothing bad ever happens.But then we find out a man who goes by the name Charles Rankin, a professor at the local university, is actually a Nazi.His real name is Franz Kindler, and he ran a concentration camp.Now he marries a local beauty, a gal named Mary Longstreet.Mr. Wilson of the United Nations War Crimes Commission comes looking for him, even though very few know what the man looks like.One who does know, is a man named Konrad Meinike, Kindler's former associate.Those two Nazis meet and Kindler strangles Meinike.How much longer can he keep his identity hidden? The Stranger (1946) is very fine work by Orson Welles.And he also does exquisite job as an actor.Edward G. Robinson is brilliant as Mr. Wilson.Loretta Young is wonderful as Mary.Philip Merivale is great as her father, Judge Adam Longstreet.Richard Long does superb job as her brother, Noah.Konstantin Shayne does very good job as Meinike.Billy House makes the most fun character as Mr. Potter, the druggist who likes to play checkers.House happened to be Welles' favorite actor and his screen time grew as the movie went ahead.This is a fantastic thriller with Film-Noir elements.It does excellent job playing with the shadows.There are many terrific scenes this film has to offer.When we see Meinike arriving repeating "I'm travelling for my health" is pretty haunting.And his death scene, and seeing Mary's dog Red dead.The ending at the clock tower is most memorable.In the film we see some footage from the concentration camps and Mary sees these horrors happening on the screen thinking; Not my husband.This film brings the horrors of what was happening there in your neighborhood stating you can't really trust anyone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Horror at Trumpton</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nazi-hunter Edward G Robinson (Wilson) tracks former Nazi bad guy Orson Welles (Franz Kindler) to a small town called 'Harper' where he is living under an assumed name of Charles Rankin. Welles is a teacher with a passion for clocks and Robinson arrives on the day of Welles's marriage to Loretta Young (Mary). Robinson sets about trying to prove Welles's true identity to those around him. Does he succeed or can Welles outwit him.....?..The film plays out at a good pace with a good cast. A special mention must go to Edward G Robinson as the likable Nazi-hunter and Billy House as Mr Potter, the general store manager whose main obsession is beating his customers at checkers. These two have some amusing scenes together as they pit their wits against one another although we know that Robinson isn't at all interested in winning the game of checkers. The scene is repeated again with House and Orson Welles to good dramatic effect as we know that Welles also isn't bothered about winning.There are a couple of stupid moments. The first being a scene at the beginning of the film where a group of grown-up schoolboys run around littering the woods with paper. It seems slightly strange for young men of this age to get so excited by playing paperchase. It's a bit gay and the comment to a woman who walks past is utterly unconvincing as these young men dressed in their gym outfits begin to run around the park chasing each other. They are NOT heterosexual males so don't try to fool us that they are. The second stupid moment is when Robinson sets up Loretta Young to be murdered by Welles. He does this and then tells Philip Merivale, who plays her father, and who also doesn't seem to mind! What!!! OK - set up my daughter to be killed....thank you. Unbelievable. Still, it progresses the storyline.However, there are some good, tense scenes, including the murder at the beginning of the film and especially towards the end with the dialogues between Loretta Young and Orson Welles. The film is worth keeping and watching again. Check out the Tower Clock. My summary line refers to a UK children's programme from the 1970s called Trumpton that always began with the figures on the Trumpton Tower Clock taking centre stage.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This small town hides a dark secret</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Orson Wells takes a back seat on the acting side of things to direct this fascinating film about a small towns peace being shattered after it is made known a Nazi is living among them.Made a year after the end of the Second World War,The Stranger tells the story of the tough,pipe smoking and determined detective Mr Wilson(Edward G.Robinson)who is deployed to find the notorious Nazi,Franz Kindler who invented the concentration camp.After releasing known war criminal Konrad Meinike(Konstantin Shaye)Wilson follows him knowing he will lead him to Kindler.He follows him to the small town of Harper Connecticut and shoves him into a mystery after Meinike vanishes.His body is later discovered buried Wilson's suspicion falls on high school teacher Charles Rankin(Orson Wells)who is married to Mary Longstreet(Loretta Young)the daughter of prominent Judge Adam Longstreet(Phillip Merivale).After posing as an antique dealer Wilson manages to befriend the family and observe Rankin.He knows he has his man when he learns of his obsession with repairing clocks,in particular the towns clock tower.Kindler was similarly obsessed and after a remark about Marx not being German because he was Jewish,Wilson knows he has struck gold.With themes very similar to those found in Hitchcocks films about do we really ever know for sure who our neighbours are?and that behind the perfect facade of suburbia the reality is very different.A good thriller with a strong lead performance from Edward G.Robinson and a chilling turn from Wells who's only saving grace is his sincere love for the fragile Mary.Comic support from Billy House as storekeeper Mr Potter is fantastic and Wells proves once again why he is one of the greatest film directors of all time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A superior made movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie once more shows that Orson Welles was really one of the best directors of all time. His movies are always something special and original to watch, due to his directing approach and use of new techniques.This movie is as well filled with some real great camera-work and some shots obviously required lots of expensive preparations and early effects, due to its complex handling. The camera in this movie is almost constantly moving and unlike many other movies from the same time period it doesn't have many fixed steady shots in it. The more and the better you pay attention to its details, the more you'll notice. Technically it's simply greatly made movie from Welles, who himself had never been too fond or proud of this production though.But the movie also had the luck that it had a great story to work around. It's an intriguing thriller story that is set right after WW II, the same time period that this movie got actually made in. It's about the search for a former Nazi who has fled to the United States and who tries to cover up his evil secret past. It's up to the War Crimes Commission investigator played by Edward G. Robinson to find out who this man.It was great and refreshing to see Edward G. Robinson playing the good guy for a change in an '40's movie. He is a person who is of course best known for playing though gangster roles, mostly in the '30's and '40's. With this movie he shows that he could just as well pull of the role as good guy. He was simply great in this movie, as can be said as well about the other actors of the movie. Orson Welles himself also plays significant role again and he of course also was no small time actor at the time. The movie has some real great characters and actors portraying them.This really isn't among Welles' best known movies but it is truly among his best in my opinion. Its thriller and suspense aspects have a sort of Hitchcock feeling to it, which is perhaps the greatest compliment you can ever give a thriller.10/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>'Thriller' that's really a subtle reflection on Nazism</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sometimes a quiet message is more powerful than a shout. For instance, "Command Decision," which is all talk, is a better war movie than many films packed with combat. Likewise, "The Stranger," which is set in America and has only one (fairly minor) character with a Teutonic accent, is one of the most effective movies I have seen about the evils of Nazism. There are no swastikas or scenes of Hitler's crimes on display here, and there's no more overt violence than in the average detective film. De-emphasizing the German trappings may have been deliberate: We have to look directly at what's in people's souls.The plot, admittedly rather improbable, has a top leader of the Third Reich blending stealthily into a peaceful New England college town just after World War II. He seems to be a genial fellow and even sounds just like an American. The only person who suspects him is a federal agent who can initially prove nothing. In a series of events that unfold almost totally at night, the hunt comes to a climax.Words are vital to this story, and one particular dinner-table conversation is often cited as pivotal to the plot. But the chat is more than just a clever device. It's a chilling illustration of how ordinary people, talking off the tops of their heads, can rationalize at least the idea of genocide.To oversimplify, the moral of this eerie tale is that there is evil in every one of us. That doesn't mean that Hitler and his millions of victims were morally equivalent, or that the Nazi fugitive and his pursuer are just two sides of the same coin. Not at all. But the point is that inhumanity is all too human. All of us must guard against the worst in ourselves. Otherwise, in some times and some places, the very worst can happen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My least favorite film of Welles'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pére Robinson and Cagney are my favorites from the between?the?wars generation ; The Red House is the film that spontaneously and wholly convinced me of Robinson's merits and gifts; this took place long ago, in my adolescence. Yet even for a '40s angry pamphlet and propaganda exploitation, THE STRANGER must have seemed pretty cynical and tough?the Nazi is caught in a no less hideous web of treachery, lies, spying, cheating and conspiracy. Pére Robinson was quite miscast in this one?his violent bad gloomy tough persona but enhances the feeling that all the action against the incognito Nazi is, morally, completely wrong?that this is a manhunt, not a trial.Even for a prototypical Nazi bashing, the ugliness of manhunt is too obvious.The film is interesting, disjointed, execrably written. The atmosphere of treason and deceit works against Welles' intentions (I guess).It explicitly teaches that, before a political imperative, nothing, no sense of honor, etc., is left. THE STRANGER acts as a big blow against the anti?Nazi propaganda; not that it rehabilitates the Nazis?it does not?but because it exposes the Nazi?hunters as amoral cynical villains, unafraid to resort to the basest means. It does a big disservice to the cause it pretends to promote. THE STRANGER shows the Nazi?hunters as empty beings deprived of any humanity whatsoever, apt only to resort to means of a shocking monstrosity. The amorality of the conspiracy here is violently ugly. With his reptilian air and cunning persuasion, Robinson portrays one more villain. I have no idea whether THE STRANGER was a success or not, how it was received by the general audiences (not the critics who have their agendas, etc.);it would be an interesting chapter of movie history?the public, popular reception of THE STRANGER.Produced by Spiegel and released in '46,with a script rewrote by Welles and his pal Huston, THE STRANGER seems to have passed rather unnoticed by the general audiences. Was there any hype? Any success? It would be interesting to know. I believe that the crass cynicism and aggressiveness prevented it achieving any real popularity with the public. It's awfully, horrendously written, _disqualifyingly written; Welles' sure craft lifts the film above the hellish infamy of this script.</fullReview>

He almost got away with his ruse, but he got to ranting so much that he slipped and a Government investigator (Edward G. Robinson) caught it.The rest of the film was a cat and mouse adventure as Robinson tried to convince Welles' new wife (Loretta Young) that she married a war criminal, and enlist her help in his capture.Excitement throughout featuring murder and attempted murder, ending with with a twist that could only occur as a result of the Nazi's efforts.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"It's a game you've got to keep your mind on"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you look over the career of Orson Welles, in many ways each film he made was a reaction to the last one, at least in terms of the problems he had with the producers and distributors who acted against him. After the butchering of what could have been his greatest film, The Magnificent Ambersons, Welles decided he would play ball with the studios, accepting minimal control over a project he neither wrote nor chose. The result, The Stranger, was to be his weakest film.The Stranger has in the first place a fairly absurd storyline. There were quite a few of these nazi-on-the-run thrillers made around this time (Fred Zinnemann made several) and they were usually a little far fetched, but the best of them were at least good suspenseful thrillers. Welles was to make some great thrillers after this, but so far his strengths had been in powerful drama and a semi-documentary approach. Welles tries to make something out of the dramatic moments, but it either needs more drama or more suspense. As it is it is neither one thing or the other.The biggest problem for Welles, and the reason why he was never a great collaborator, is that his style relied upon a wholeness of approach. His best films seem totally orchestrated, with images flowing rhythmically into one another, and a sense of balance to the whole project. To achieve this he would either need to have collaborators who were totally on the same wavelength as him, or to be in total control himself ? from first treatment to final cut. There is a little of that flowing style on evidence here, with images dovetailing into each other, and recurring themes like the clock and the game of checkers being given prominence, but ultimately this is someone else's movie, and not a very good one at that.What remains of Welles is his technical style, which was in fact becoming more polished even as the overall quality of his films diminished. He has a very distinctive actor-centred approach to shot composition. For Welles the question seems to be not "How do I shoot this scene?" but "How do I film this character?" He doesn't shoot a set with actors in it, he shoots the actors that happen to be on the set. He even uses actors as aesthetic framing devices, like another director might use a tree branch or the side of a building. This probably stems from Welles' deep respect for the actors above all else, and the desire to purely photograph a performance.Speaking of actors, there are three great leads here and in a way it is a shame to see them sold short by a poor script. Welles directs himself as he often did, getting his teeth into his first really villainous role, and just about managing to make the war criminal convincing. I like Edward G. Robinson as the detective, but it was of course in Robinson's comfort zone, and I wish Welles had got his way and been allowed to cast Agnes Moorehead in the role ? that would at least have given The Stranger something unique and interesting. The best performance comes from Loretta Young, who has what must be the most difficult role, her character having to slowly come to terms with having married a monster. It would have been easy for her to slip into hysterical melodrama, but she manages superbly to keep it realistic. In fact, Young's performance is probably the best thing about this picture.Orson Welles may be seen as a something of a crusader for the cause of independent directors, but his inability to be a team player was in itself a weakness, and in this case may have distracted him from really trying to make the most of the material he was given. Still, the screenplay is pure pulp and I don't think there's much anyone could have done with it without some major rewrites. Compare this to Welles' much later Touch of Evil, in which he took a trashy novel and totally turned it round into a masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A real buried treasure directed by Orson Welles during his Hollywood heyday. Welles plays a small-town teacher engaged to local girl Loretta Young while carrying around a very grave secret. He's a fugitive Nazi! Edward G. Robinson is the government man closing in. THE STRANGER, with a script by John Huston is must see entertainment, not only for Welles completists but for noir buffs as well. Welles' typically dizzying camera-work is on display and he creates one of his most vile characters, one who will kill at even the possibility of exposure. It's a great performance. Welles is matched by Robinson and the two make terrific adversaries. The usually hard to take Young is just OK...she is a bit too glamorous for her role. A very young Richard Long is in it too. The film's climax is extremely exciting. Sadly, the film is in the public domain so finding a decent copy can be a chore!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very well directed film with a relatively weak story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first saw this movie in the theater quite a while ago and found it to be a well made film but with a forgettable plot. Second viewing doesn't really change my opinion. It's a suspense movie, not a mystery, so you can't really complain about the fact that we know who the killer is from the very beginning. But even so, a good suspense movie should have a better plot than this one.That complaint aside, it's a fine film from the great director. The opening sequences are especially interesting with Welles' famous roving camera technique used right away as we see the release of a prisoner who is going to lead the investigator, Mr. Wilson (Edward G. Robinson) to an escaped Nazi war criminal (Welles), Professor Rankin. What's interesting in the basic set-up is that Rankin has managed to ensconce himself in a small upper crust heartland community and is engaged to be married to a federal judge's daughter, Mary (Loretta Young). The film's textual message, such as it is, focuses on the concept that danger and evil can exist even in the most apparently wholesome and positive circumstances or environments.Probably the film's most interesting scene is the dinner scene where Mr. Wilson attempts to interrogate Rankin in a very casual manner. Rankin would almost have escaped if it weren't for his momentary slip up in saying that Karl Marx "wasn't a German, he was a Jew".Perhaps in a way the film is saying that evil is able to hide so successfully in the midst of innocent and good people because as long as someone is well educated and has mastered social customs, as Professor Rankin has; and not just that, but the fact that his evil could only be revealed by a casual slip of the tongue implies that our ordinary social customs do not encompass or do not reveal the true nature of our selves.Personally I didn't think much of Loretta Young in the role. Not sure how much was her fault, because the role is pretty thin in my opinion. The film never really comes to grips with the idea that this "good" woman was able to be fooled by a bigot into marriage. It would have been a more interesting film to me if the portrayal of the townsfolk hadn't been so clearly intended to show them as essentially "good" and Welles' character as totally different from them.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It may well be one of Welles' lesser films but there is some really good stuff in here. I loved the length of some of the shots, not as spectacularly long or as complicated as the opening of A Touch of Evil but still long enough. There's one in particular when Edward G Robinson and the boy walk out of the doctor's office and cross the road. There's no dialogue between them and nothing happens. They just cross the road and think about what they have just been told - and we the audience get to think about it too. When was the last time you saw a mainstream Hollywood movie that gave you time to think about what was going on? Or what about the long tracking shot when Rankin and Meinike meet in the woods? It's wonderful. We get to see the actors really act. From the moment two old comrades meet till the moment one of them murders the other. It's hypnotising. There isn't a cut between one of seventeen different angles every other word as so often happens these days. And there is some lovely acting from here from Welles. Smart and creepy. The way his hands twist and crawl on the back of the pew as he lies to his wife in the church.As with all Welles' movies we can only wish the Director's Cut was still in existence but what remains is an interesting little film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although this is not one of Orson Welles' masterpieces, it's a very well made film that holds up well. It's an espionage thriller concerning the hunting of Nazi war criminals in the quiet New England town of Harper, Connecticut. It's not a thriller of the modern type with lots of gunfire, explosions, and car chases to hold one's interest. Instead, it depends for tension on drawing us into the various characters' (justified) paranoia. It includes terrific performances by Orson Welles, Loretta Young, and Edward G. Robinson that justify the time spent on their own. In addition it has many of the Welles signature touches like strange camera angles and bright faces emerging from deep black shadows. There is a small detail in the beginning of the movie which had me anticipating an entirely different ending than what was supplied. Without that one detail, the ending would have been fairly predictable, but because that detail was highlighted the way it was, the movie managed to surprise me with the ending. This was another of Welles favorite tricks, to give us something insignificant in the beginning of a movie to influence our expectations of the rest of the movie.</fullReview>

It is one of his least ambitious--there's very little of the wild technical inventiveness featured in "Citizen Kane"--but taken on its own terms it's an engrossing thriller. The acting is superb, the action moves briskly, and there are many wonderful moments. Welles' monologue at the dinner table on "the German" is remarkable. My favorite Welles touch is a moment of black humor. SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER Franz Kindler (Welles) is using a public phone booth. He picks up a pencil meant for notetaking in the phone booth and, while talking, idly doodles a swastika on the wall. Realizing what he's done, he obscures it. END SPOILER END SPOILER END SPOILER It's too bad that people knock "The Stranger" by comparing it to masterpieces like "Kane" or "Touch of Evil" instead of taking it for what it is: a crackling suspense film that is well worth a look.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Directed by and starring Orson Welles, he apparently fell off the Hollywood maps following a couple of box office failures, it is odd to think that when this film came only two years after Citizen Kane. Basically from the United Nations War Crimes Commission comes Mr. Wilson (Little Caesar's Edward G. Robinson) who is hunting for Nazi fugitive and war criminal Franz Kindler (Orson Welles), who has assumed new identity of prep school teacher Professor Charles Rankin in a small town in the United States. Rankin has also married the daughter of Supreme Court Justice Adam Longstreet (Philip Merivale), Mary Longstreet (Loretta Young), but Wilson is hoping Kindler's former associate Konrad Meinike (Konstantin Shayne) will lead him to the man, but following him to the town of Harper, Connecticut he loses him before any meeting. When Rankin does meet Meinike and has him begging to confess, he strangles the associate to avoid him exposing his location or any other details, but Wilson, without any proof, does find out Rankin is formerly Kindler, only Rankin's wife knows that there was a meeting between him and his associate. So he has to convince Mrs. Rankin that her husband is a criminal and that he is likely to kill her to eliminate any threat of exposure, and Rankin also finds the family dog Red discovering the body of Meinike, so he poisons the dog. Mary does start to suspect wrong doing, but love has blinded her judgement of him, she is torn between telling the truth to the authorities and helping him make a good new life for himself, but she is then shown Nazi concentration camp footage and Wilson explains Rankin developed the idea of genocide. She finally breaks down when she discovers Rankin's plot to kill her, in a tense moment she dares him to do it, but he is prevented by Wilson and Mary's brother Noah Longstreet (Richard Long), so Kindler flees, and finally falls to his death from a church belfry. Also starring Philip Merivale as Judge Adam Longstreet, Byron Keith as Dr. Jeffrey Lawrence, Billy House as Mr. Potter and Martha Wentworth as Sara. Even though I may have admittedly not being the fullest attention to everything going on, Welles does make an interesting dark minded character, Robinson is certainly different this time playing a good guy, and Young does well as the wife caught in the middle, the nearly simple enough, and I agree with critics are there are some distinguishing touches, it should remain in black and white and not be colourised like it was apparently, a reasonably good thriller. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Writing, Original Story. Worth watching!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bad Boy Welles Told The Truth</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Orson Welles' "THE STRANGER" is the farthest thing from a Hollywood 'sell-out'. This is not Welles' making a stereotypical thriller for a major studio, and just trying to get into the good graces of film executives. Welles decided that he would take this story and run with it. He delivers a touchdown, challenging the preconceptions of his audience, daring to be the first to show heretofore unreleased military footage of concentration camps, and in his own masterful performance presenting a leading man who is totally corrupt, totally evil, without a single redeeming quality.Post-WWII America was enthralled coast-to-coast by the famous traveling Christian tent revivalists, of whom Oral Roberts was one of over a hundred very young and charismatic 'miracle workers'. And in a decade which saw wildly successful major film productions of Christian classics like "The Bells of St. Mary's," "The Keys of the Kingdom," and "The Song of Bernadette," here is Welles actually having the gall to have his own character strangle a man on his knees who is praying for his own salvation and asking God to forgive his sins. Incredible! Do you realize how many people must have sat there in the theater in complete shock?'Let's remember also that two of Loretta Young's best pictures from this era were the Christian-themed "Come To The Stable" and "The Bishop's Wife." Welles never ran away from taking a risk. The story concept of Nazi war criminals' hiding out in America, by the way, was definitely based on fact. This scenario was hardly the propaganda other writers here have decried. As pointed out in one other review, "Operation Paperclip" was a full-fledged, well-financed, and historically documented recruitment campaign conducted by American and British intelligence to facilitate the move of Nazi scientists, doctors, psychiatrists, advertising geniuses, and economists into teaching posts in major U.S. universities. None other than Henry Kissinger himself was involved, and he cut his teeth on this kind of dirty work.Welles broke a taboo of silence. His movie's Nazi war criminal goes to teach at a boys' New England prep school, instead of Yale, where the Bush family, and other American political figures, had so many interesting contacts through the "Skull &amp; Bones" society. It was the grandfather of "W," Prescott Bush, whose financing of the Axis military brought him up on charges before a court of law. Welles' little monologue at the dinner table is noteworthy not only because he mentions Karl Marx was a Jew, but because he makes reference to the occult religious beliefs of the The Third Reich. Who would have thought Welles was a 'conspiracy theorist'?It is a mistake to assume that Welles did not have creative control over this project. Please note that both Welles and John Huston were 'uncredited'. In actual terms, this means they did a major overhaul together of the script. Accordingly, consider the line delivered by Robinson while screening the shocking war footage for Loretta Young. "The prisoners were given showers first to open up the pores of their skin to receive the gas." Then a shot of the famous long white room appears, with rows of shower fixtures which apparently emitted both water and Zyklon B lethal gas. Hollywood doesn't like outspoken men, not then, not now. It was Welles' picture so it was his career that took the fall, not Huston's.Welles certainly had his self-indulgent side, and pushing the envelope on controversial issues satisfied his ego, I think. As for his acting, it was always dangerously on the verge of going over-the-top, and what a magnificent ham he sometimes allowed himself to be!In "THE STRANGER", however, Welles keeps himself under control, and so is able to keep his audience guessing. Almost to the very end, here is one viewer who wondered if the loyal devotion of the agonized Loretta Young would finally get through to him, and if he could grow to love her in spite of himself. To his credit, Welles used those 'blank stare' close-ups of his to feed into this possible emotional ambivalence.The love scenes between Welles and Young are brief, but intense. It is clear that Loretta Young's character is under the sheer physical spell of this man. Welles, on or off camera, was magnetic to women, and this handsome "stranger" would have been completely unlike anyone else she had ever known. Compare Welles to the other men at the social gatherings in the film, her father's friends, young lawyers, members of her social set. She had fallen in love, all right. Oh, regarding Welles' later disfiguring weight gain? I believe it was deliberate, the same way De Niro put on the poundage for "RAGING BULL" years ago. Welles had been a sex addict, and this was his way of breaking the cycle, channeling his robust appetites towards gourmet food instead. Brando did the same thing. As these men grew older, they wearied of the chase. The glowing performance of Loretta Young in this film seems to divide reviewers radically. Perhaps it is because she is so unique as a 'lady,' even when her feelings were passionate ones (compare the younger Loretta Young paired with Gable in "CALL OF THE WILD"). She is so 'different' that she makes people uncomfortable. Young was not a seductress or a vamp. I remember well the story that she forbade any profanity on her sets. She has an indefinable quality which evidently can be misinterpreted, making her a 'bad actress' in the eyes of some.I take with a grain of salt the rumor that Agnes Moorehead was Welles' first choice for the Nazi-hunter role played with such relish by Robinson. I can only say: 'Thank God' she didn't get the part. It seems reverse sexism is politically correct these days, looking ahead to November 2008,regardless if someone is right for a role or not.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I watched them, here like God, looking at little ants?The Stranger</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With a plot that contains a Nazi war criminal hiding out in New England with his past erased, playing the role of school teacher and marrying the judge's daughter, all while being on the hunt by an Allied Commission man, you'd think some good things could happen. Then you see that it stars and is directed by Orson Welles?you can't lose. Unfortunately, absolutes are too misleading because Welles proves here that he is not infallible. In a heavy-handed story, complete with over-the-top performances, caricatures of past roles, multitudes of close-ups to show raised eyebrows and bulging eyes, The Stranger becomes more of a joke on itself than a serious thriller. If it has anything going for it, it is the fact that the unintentional humor is so pronounced and comical that it kind of works.Welles himself is a lot of fun and plays the part well, completely without any trace of a German accent?tough to do, I would think, if you were an ex-Nazi general that came up with the concept of mass genocide. At least his friend, released from jail to trail him, had a thick gait to his voice giving some of the story authenticity. Welles plays the charmer impeccably, almost just riffing on himself; who could resist the guy? I really just like the fact that he casts himself as the villain oftentimes over the hero, not many vanity chasing leading men today would do that. They all direct just so they can secure themselves more screen time. To those means, it is his directing that has some flashes of brilliance mixed in with bouts of laziness. To show so many lingering reaction shots on himself whenever he gleans the news around town that his cover is slowly being blown is so blatant that it makes the subtle scenes just fade into the background. Scenes like when Welles is telling his wife a tale about who the little man was that came calling, shot in a way to only show her face looking at him while his hands wring around the back of a church pew are so gorgeous that you feel sorry they are apart of such a mixed bag whole. One moment also shows the couple going in for a kiss, so up close that their faces are silhouetted against the back wall?stunning to view.The rest of the acting isn't half bad either. Loretta Young, as the bride, is adequate and shows some nice moments when denying what she knows as the truth deep inside her. Edward G. Robinson is quite good as the government man on the case. With his gangster demeanor and looks, he plays the intelligence card right and his cajoling of the truth from people is impressive and believable. Even Billy House as the shopkeeper?and town clerk of course?is a riot. His name, Mr. Potter, isn't the only thing resembling the role of same name in It's a Wonderful Life though, he looks very much like Lionel Barrymore too. The characters couldn't be farther apart, however, and each time he puts on his betting hat for a game of checkers was priceless. Along with them came a turn from Richard Long as Noah Longstreet, Welles' brother-in-law. This was the one role that stuck with me as truly good. His na?veté and fear for what he learned about the man he barely knew as well as for his sister in that man's clutches was portrayed to perfection. Holding his own opposite bigger names, Long was probably the best thing coming out of the film for me.Welles might have been able to hone things in a bit more and made a tenser film. Instead, it appears he is enjoying the broader approach, allowing his actors to play up the camp, maybe to diffuse the serious subject matter of Nazi war criminals, who knows? As my friend said upon the film's completion, you know there must have been trouble when one person created the story, two others adapted it, and yet another wrote the screenplay. One would think Welles would have put his own hat into the mix and steered everything down a tighter path, but maybe he felt the need to just go out and have fun. After the production troubles and release debacles for his two previous films, Citizen Kane and The Magnificent Ambersons, you can't blame him for just taking the paycheck to ready another trip into the warzones.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly Good!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wow, I was pleasantly surprised by Welles' direction and performance in The Stranger. Some of my favorite moments were: when Rankin gathered up the newspaper in the woods, the first scene with Meineke and Potter in the drugstore (very naturally acted), Rankin doodling the swastika in the phone booth (wicked!) and Edward G. Robinson's tumble down the stairs. The musical score was unbelievably tense in a few scenes as well, especially in the paper chase/murder. Two bones to pick about the film, though. One is a plot point - why didn't they look for him in the clock tower in the first place (very Frankenstein-ish at that point, though. Quite nice). The other is Loretta Young's acting. EXTREMELY overwrought. I kept expecting her to jam her fist into her mouth in that "terrified" pose that actresses used back then. No matter, though. This was a first-rate thriller--no use comparing it with Kane or Ambersons, it's apples and oranges really. Watch this and, say, Vertigo or The Man Who Knew Too Much and you'll be convinced that Welles could have given Hitchcock a run for his money in the thriller department.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why Isn't This Film More Well Known?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In "The Stranger," Orson Welles once again demonstrates a level of depth and sophistication that so far exceeds the Hollywood that ostracized him. How many films or film makers were tackling the Final Solution in 1946?The film owes much to the influence of Alfred Hitchcock. It reminded me quite a bit of "Shadow of a Doubt." It has a lot of the same elements of that Hitchcock film: the small town suddenly confronted by a criminal masquerading as something he is not as the authorities close in. The scene in which Welles' Professor Rankin frantically picks up the pieces of paper in the woods is right out of Hitchcock 101.Sadly, "The Stranger" is overshadowed by Welles' other films like "Citizen Kane" and "The Lady from Shanghai." That's a real shame because this really is one of his best.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mystery lies within Welles's motivations</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While watching this '46 homage to gender role-reversals within noir, (Welles is the femme-fatale)I was struck by the second act, at how little interest Welles has in the plot and particularly creating intriguing protagonists. Obviously, it's called the 'The Stranger' for a reason...but Welles puts little thought into creating memorable scenes and psychological insight into both Loretta's long-suffering wife and Robinson's driven detective. It's been said this is Welles's least favorite of his own films and that may be considering he did nothing for and with a legend like Robinson and Young is made to look like a girlish fool for buying into this imposter. Although Welles does a keen job of weaving us into the story, their are few memorable innovations save for the final clock tower sequence that has been ripped off countless times from "Batman" to "Back to the Future." The real interest lays into your own interpretation as to the intersection of beliefs between Welles and the character he wrote. To sentimentalize on Nazi horrors would have been beneath Welles, so instead he creates an amoral character who believes the ends surely justify the means. Pay close attention to the scenes where Welles is allowed to expound, his storytelling techniques throughout the first twenty minutes, and a few set pieces...it's what makes the film still intriguing to watch some sixty plus years later.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is not a well-known film, but it is a gem with a great cast. Welles has a field-day as the mysterious stranger who comes to an all-American town and integrates himself. Then Robinson arrives looking for an escaped Nazi war criminal, and strange things begin to happen. The setting, atmosphere, music, and perfomances add up to a chilling thriller. The symbolism of the final sequence in the clock tower is wonderful: the Nazis believed their's was an idea whose time had come, and finally time catches up with their idea.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting for Its Time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stranger, The (1946) *** (out of 4) Interesting but flawed thriller about a war crimes commissioner (Edward G. Robinson) who travels to a small town to find a Nazi who is hiding among the citizens. He eventually comes to suspect a Professor Rankin (Orson Welles) who recently married a woman (Loretta Young) who has no idea about his past. Coming after CITIZEN KANE and THE MAGNIFICENT AMBERSONS, it's easy to see why this film has pretty much been forgotten over the years. It certainly can't stand next to the two previous movies but when viewed on its own the thing is pretty impressive. I think there are a few major issues with the screenplay that keeps this from being a masterpiece but it is a very interesting piece for its time. Considering the war had just ended, a lot of movies were playing it safe as they looked forward to a peaceful world without any need for fear. That's certainly not the goal of this movie, which really appears to have Welles wanting to warn everyone not to turn their back because evil can be anywhere and it might just happen to be the man you go to church with or the man teaching your kids. There's a certain level of paranoia running throughout this film and that's what makes the film so interesting to watch today. It should go without saying but we get some excellent performances with Robinson leading the way as the kind Mr. Wilson. Robinson made a career out of playing tough characters and this here is certainly one but of a different sort. This is more of a thinking man's role and Robinson does a nice job with it. Young is also good in the role of the wife but I think the screenplay does her no favors as a lot of the film's issues can be seen in her weak character. Then we have Welles who is cold as ice and turns in a great performance. He's certainly easy to see in the role and is so cold and intelligent that you can easily believe he did all the things he's accused of. Philip Merivale, Richard Long and Konstantin Shayne all add nice support. There are some major flaws here including a few little plot holes that seem to get overlooked by the Robinson character but what really kept the film from being better is Young's character. At the start of the film we're made to believe that she's a very intelligent woman but as the movie goes along she just gets dumber and dumber. I know the film tries to make you think she's in love but to me her character just does one stupid thing after another and in many ways comes off way too over=emotional. I think Welles could have done a re-write on her character and everything would have played out better. With that said, this is still a very interesting movie for its era and one that contains plenty of suspense.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Edward G. Robinson, as the suspicious inspector, turns in a solid performance in an otherwise mediocre film.Orson Welles, who directed this, showed himself to be a master of evil. The problem here was that the plot was too obvious. Even a sweet, vulnerable Loretta Young can't do very much here.That ending scene with the clock was memorable but certainly not exactly a joy to watch.A far better 1946 Welles film is "Tomorrow Is Forever." In that one, also dealing with the Nazis, you had some sympathy for the Welles character.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It may have been thrilling for an audience in 1946, but the movie is now a bit boring. I had a hard time sitting through the whole thing, and it was very predictable: I mean, we know from the beginning of the movie that Welles is the nazi war criminal, and I'll give you one guess as to whether he is caught and appropriately punished in the end.Not worth watching. It's sad that Welles only made three movies worth seeing in his long career: Kane, Ambersons, and A Touch of Evil.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I agree with Orson Welles! Agnes Moorehead would have been a WONDERFUL Nazi hunter!Edgar G. Robinson does well, but the Moorehead casting would have been more subtle. It would have been fun seeing the Hidden Nazi get tackled by the wit and shrewdness Moorehead could project!With her great catlike wit, She would have been dissed by the presumably woman-despising Nazi! But Moorehead ...could have better awakened Loretta Young's trusting young wife character...to awaken from her too blind innocence to see who her husband really is!Not many women of that era can carry off strength and intelligence (mostly I suspect because those roles were not so common). But suspecting that Welles knew a strong and great female actor when he saw one!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Your subtext is showing, Mr. Welles</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To get ready for Orson Welles' THE STRANGER on TCM-- airing as part of the Projected Image series on Tuesday September 9th-- I began reading comments about the film here on the IMDb. I inadvertently stumbled across an array of comments that the story has a gay subtext running throughout. I hadn't looked at it that way before, but the more I think about it-- I am inclined to agree it's there.One poster laid out very specific reasons that such a subtext exists within the film and that it can be interpreted thusly. I messaged him and said I felt his comments were on target.I think Welles was conscious of the gay subtext, because for the reasons the poster so clearly outlined, it seems obvious Welles is using religion and small-town secrecy as a means of addressing a community's so-called great hidden evils-- and I think the likelihood that men were having sex with each other on the down-low in 1946 and entering into sham marriages with women as camouflage may be greater than actual Nazi war criminals taking up residence in America's towns.And any man hiding his homosexuality from his wife would certainly be a stranger to her. If this is a correct reading of the subtext, then Welles has done a masterful job of telling a powerful story and subverting the production code.According to information here at the IMDb, five different people are listed as having contributed to the writing of the screenplay for THE STRANGER-- including John Huston and Welles himself. Of course, since Welles directed, he had the most influence over the shaping of the story (and what wound up on screen). Obviously, any one of these five men could have been adding extra layers or subtext into the narrative.Getting back to the gay subtext-- the scene with the boys playing and the two men having intense physical contact in the bushes is very odd, to say the least-- it is like what one often sees with Hitchcock, that murders and sex are symbolically linked. This is a very perverse death in THE STRANGER, and the way it is juxtaposed with a parade of adolescent boys in the woods underscores the idea that unnatural activities are occurring in this sleepy hamlet. Later, the dog's determination to dig up the body and the killing of the dog re-emphasizes such unnaturalness. And then there's the dinner table scene where Mary (Loretta Young) tells Mr. Wilson (Edward G. Robinson) that she doesn't want the town clock to work, even after her honeymoon-- a knowing nod to the strangely dysfunctional dynamic between her and Kindler and their brand of intimacy. In the end, their intimacy is exposed for the fraud it is--she reasons that her reputation and her love have been ruined, to the extreme lengths that it is now her turn to die and to take Kinder with her in the fall-- borrowing imagery from the myth of Orpheus in the Underworld.Of course, people can easily relate something in their personal lives to the events, situations and characters in a movie like THE STRANGER that were not intentionally added (or even consciously placed there) by the screenwriters or director. But I think that is what makes us enjoy certain films more than others-- because there are deeper stranger truths we may be responding to within the narrative. Nothing wrong with that at all.</fullReview>
