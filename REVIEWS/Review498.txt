		<shortDescription>Magnificent absurdist fantasy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One would have expected Hitchcock's return to major studio filmmaking to err on the side of chastened caution. Surely few expected his most riotous, unrestrained film, a gleeful melange of vicious black comedy, exciting suspense, mocking manipulation, and astonishing flights of fancy. But that is precisely what they got: STRANGERS ON A TRAIN.What is remarkable is how much Bruno's transgression disrupts the world of the film. Much has been made of the masterly crosscutting motif, but its immediate effect is to completely obstruct the straight line of progress Guy is making of his life, and hence the society he represents or is eager to join. Guy is the archetypal American, the working-class boy made good, moving in influential circles, athletic, successful, handsome. Bruno is his destructive opposite, gay, decadent, 'European' (he lives off his father, in a Big House, and just lounges about dreaming of murder). Bruno's life is one of repetition, circularity, whereas Guy moves straight ahead. It is Bruno's achievement to move Guy into his realm (represented by the merry-go-round) and force HIM to transgress (break the law, hope for murder (Bruno's)).Bruno is quite literally fighting patriarchy. All the authority figures in the film are criticised - Bruno's father, a man whose brutality we get a glimpse of, but the true horror of which is constantly alluded to in the film (especially in Aunt Clara's paintings - that incredibly intense negative energy must come from somewhere); Anna's incredibly Machiavellian, self-serving father; the insensitive judge who thinks nothing of lunching after an execution; the tennis commentator whose smugly authorative comments are always mistaken. Far from being the mother-hater of legend, Hitch, as Robin Wood perceived, is deeply hostile to fathers and patriarchy.Bruno's transgression turns the world topsy-turvy. This is Hitch's most surreal film. Whenever Guy is in his plot, he is filmed straight, with conventionally romantic music. But whenever Bruno intrudes, the atmosphere becomes carnivalesque, bizarre, much more fun. This is Hitch's first truly American film, revelling in the primitive detritus of Americana. Grown men puncture little boys' balloons, or try to throw them off merry-go-rounds. Distinguished professors of mathematics sing about goats on trains. Elderly society matrons are strangled at elegant soirees. Washington is filmed like a series of spare lines in a vast desert under a huge sky, like a haunting Dali painting. There is one of the greatest, and funniest, scenes in all cinema when we see a motionless, smiling Bruno in a sea of turning heads at a tennis match, an image worthy of Magritte. Just look at any scene with Bruno in it, and watch it derail into the bizarre.Phalluses abound in the most ridiculous permutations - check all those balloons (Hitch had obviously just seen THE THIRD MAN) - as well as in more staid environs: Washington will never look the same again. STRANGERS is also, VERTIGO notwithstanding, Hitch's most overtly sexual film - as well as the phalluses, there is the sustained homoeroticism, the remarkable play with 'riding' horses; the gobsmacking fellatio joke when Hitch's daughter spills powder over the policeman.And yet Hitch doesn't stint on good old suspense. In the very proper endeavour to show what a great artist he was, critics tend to overlook what made him famous in the first place. Much has been made of Bruno as a prototype of Norman Bates, and Hitch plays merry havoc on audience identification, willing Bruno into murder. There is a hilariously painful sequence where Bruno loses the lighter with which he intends to frame Guy down a drain. The gasps of tension and sighs of relief on the part of the audience I was a part of in support of an insane murderer is inherently funny, slightly disturbing, and highly revealing about our true reactions to conformity and success. And Hitch milks it with callous glee - listen to the mocking music and exagerrated compositions, and kick yourself for taking it all so seriously.STRANGERS is one of Hitch's five best films, and therefore one of the greatest things in cinema. The dialogue is so strange and brilliant, I can't believe it wasn't written by Chandler. Patricia Hitchcock is a wonderful imp, standing in for her cheeky father as she taunts Guy. The fairground finale is a remarkable, dizzying fusion of exciting, tense set-piece, black comedy and symbolic site. If Bruno's final words condemn him to hell (according to the Catholic precepts Hitch is supposed to embody: compare with a similar ending in THE KILLERS), we applaud his integrity, infinitely preferable to Guy's debased serving of self.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A stunning thriller from the master of suspense</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alfred Hitchcock has made many brilliant thrillers, and many of them have gone on to be hailed as some of the greatest films of all time. One film that tends to get somewhat lost under the Vertigo's and the Psycho's is this film; Strangers on a Train, the most compelling film that Hitchcock ever made. The story follows Guy Haines, a tennis player and a man soon to be wed to the Senator's daughter, if he can get a divorce from his current wife. One day, on the way to see his wife, he meets the mentally unstable Bruno Anthony aboard a train and soon gets drawn into a murder plot that he can neither stop nor stall; and one that could ultimately cost him his life.The conversation aboard the train between Bruno and Guy is one of the cinema's most intriguing and thought provoking of all time. What if two people "swapped" murders, thus resolving themselves of all suspicion of the crime, and rendering their motive irrelevant? Could this truly be the perfect murder? What makes this film all the more frightening is that the events that Guy is lead into could happen to any, normal everyday person. Everyone has someone they'd like to get rid of, so what if you met an insane man aboard a train that does your murder for you and then forces you to do his? The chances of it happening are unlikely, but it's the idea that anyone could be a murderer that is central to the message of Strangers on a Train; and in this situation, anyone could. Is there any actor on earth that could have portrayed the character of Bruno Anthony any better than Robert Walker? The man was simply born for the part. He manages to capture just the right mood for his character and absolutely commands every scene he is in. The character of Bruno is a madman, but he's not a lunatic; he's a calculating, conniving human being and Robert Walker makes the character believable. His performance is extremely malevolent, and yet understated enough to keep the character firmly within the realms of reality. Unfortunately, Robert Walker died just one year after the release of Strangers on a Train, and I believe that is a great loss to cinema. Nobody in the cast shines as much as Walker does, but worth mentioning is his co-star Farley Granger. Granger never really impresses that much, but his performance is good enough and he holds his own against Walker. Also notable about his performance is that he portrays his character as a very normal person; and that is how it should be. Ruth Roman is Guy's wife to be. She isn't really in the film enough to make a lasting impression, but she makes the best of what she has. Alfred Hitchcock's daughter, Patricia, takes the final role of the four central roles as Barbara, the sister of Guy's fiancé. She is suitably lovely in this role, and she tends to steal a lot of the scenes that she is in.Alfred Hitchcock's direction is always sublime, and it is very much so in this film. There is one shot in particular, that sees the murder of the film being committed in the reflection of a pair of sunglasses. This is an absolutely brilliant shot, and one that creates a great atmosphere for the scene. Hitchcock's direction is moody throughout, and very much complies with the film noir style. The climax to the film is both spectacular and exciting, and I don't think that anyone but Hitchcock could have pulled it off to the great effect that it was shown in this film. It's truly overblown, and out of turn from the rest of the movie; but it works. There is a reason that Hitchcock is often cited as the greatest director of all time, and the reason for that is that he doesn't only use the script to tell the film's story, but he also uses to camera to do so as well. Strangers on a Train is one of the greatest thrillers ever made. Its story is both intriguing and thought provoking, and is sure to delight any fan of cinema. A masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of his best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a little known Hitchcock movie but I think it is one of his best. I like how he inserts humor into this crime drama. For example the small boy pointing a gun at the Bruno character at the carnival and the Bruno character popping his balloon with a lit cigarette. And there is the comic scene at the tennis courts where the audience in unison moves there heads back and forth following the ball except for Bruno who glances straight away at the tennis player. Hitchcock plays suspense masterfully as in the tunnel of love sequence early in the film. We know that Bruno plans to murder the woman and we 'see' that is why he is following her into the tunnel. We hear a scream and think the deed is done when voila! the girl comes sailing out with her two admirers. Then there is one of the finest scenes in all movie history: the final scene on the carousel. Hitchcock manages suspense on many non-stop levels: the two protagonists fighting each other, a small boy who nearly falls from the ride as it whirls at tremendous speed, and the elderly man who crawls beneath the carousel to try and get at the brakes. Although I think the end of the scene was a bit over the top it was masterful to that point and I will never forget it.I was surprised to see Ruth Roman in the lead. Usually Hitchcock has blondes for his leads, but the commentator on the TMC channel told us Hitch had to use her because she was under contract to the studio where he filmed it.I highly recommend this obscure Hitchcock masterpiece and give 9.99 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of Hitchcock's finest achievements</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Strangers on a Train" is a brilliant example of what Hitchcock could do best, continually develop his plot and characters in an atmosphere both creepy and humorous. The film has great dialogue, superb characters, good acting, and naturally superb direction from the master of suspense who is truly at his best here. Robert Walker's Bruno Anthony is a character few will forget; he is creepy, psychopathic, and as M. Night Shyamalan says on one of the DVD's special features it is the fact that he has moral standards, however unconventional and disturbed they may be, that makes him such a dangerous man. Strangers is a truly involving film, one that takes you on a ride you won't forget anytime soon, it has one of the best examples of buildup you could find on film, and as soon as it ends the film takes you on a journey that entertains and terrifies and even makes you laugh. This is a truly brilliant example of film-making, every shot is drenched in suspense, every cut is masterful, every detail important, every second exciting, it never lets go till the very end, and what an ending that is, a delicious bit of humor that is perfectly in tone with the rest of this delightful masterpiece.Some have criticized Farley Granger's performance as Guy Haines, but it really is quite perfect; he delivered all his lines well and makes us feel honestly sympathetic towards him. Robert Walker is simply genius as Bruno Anthony, a great character that wouldn't have been nearly as memorable without Robert Walker's devilishly evil portrayal of him. The supporting cast are good, Ruth Roman, Leo G. Carroll, Kasey Rogers, Howard St. John and Patricia Hitchcock all deliver good performances that enhance what was already a good film and make it a great film. Alfred Hitchcock's direction is, as always, sublime.What makes "Strangers" so good is the simple plot. It isn't a complicated story, two strangers meet on a train, and one comes up with a crazy plot: "You do my murder, I do yours." One takes it as a joke and shrugs it off, but the other takes himself seriously and goes on to commit the murder he offered to, getting the 'good guy' into huge trouble. The script is adapted superbly well by Whitfield Cook from a novel by Patricia Highsmith.This is really one of Hitchcock's most interesting films from a technical perspective while also providing more than enough laughs, suspense, and thrills to keep just about anybody engaged.10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing performance by Robert Walker</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Strangers on a Train" was one of those film classics I had always heard about but somehow never gotten around to actually seeing. I finally watched it a few weeks ago and, as always with any Hitchcock movie, it not only stood up to the test of time, it far surpassed most thrillers being made today. You can see the inspiration for future action movies here - the climactic ending with the out-of-control merry-go-round and the two villains dueling each other reminded me of the big action sequence at the end of Jan de Bont's "Speed." Of course, "Strangers" is over forty years older than "Speed" and contains no modern special effects, but the visceral thrill is there - Hitchcock was a true genius.The not-so-subtle gay side of Bruno (Robert Walker in an amazing performance) has taken form in many other psycho-stalker-figures in future movies. Consider him a male version of Jennifer Jason Leigh in "Single White Female." He knows about Guy before he even meets him on the train - we almost get the feeling their contact isn't incidental - and is soon entirely obsessed with him.Hitchcock loved the Oedipial elements in his movies (also see "Psycho" for more blatant undertones) and there's a lot of that here. Bruno hates his father and wants him to die so he can be with his mother. His effeminate ways and obvious homosexuality must have just slipped by the censors in 1951, when gays were not "allowed" to be portrayed on the screen - yet Hitchcock gets the message through effectively when we see Bruno in the lounge on the telephone wearing a very non-masculine robe, flirting with Guy and responding to his mother.The deep layers of this movie make it a fast-paced thriller than you can return to again and again - unfortunately it's being remade as a big-budget Hollywood production, but after seeing the original I honestly can't imagine anything surpassing the sheer white-knuckle thrills of this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Movie Is A Major Improvement Over The Book</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Usually, it is the other way around, but in this case, the movie is a major improvement over the original book.I had seen this wonderful movie at least a dozen times, before I managed to find a copy of the book it was taken from....the book has the same title and was written by Patricia Highsmith.I scoured the used bookstores for years, before I finally found a copy, and because the movie was SO good, I could not wait to begin reading the story in its original version.I was never so disappointed!Not because the book is unreadable...but because Hitchcock made such vast improvements over the book that the book simply does not come close to measuring up to the movie version.That said, let me now comment on Robert Walker's amazing performance as Bruno Antony.This was Robert Walker's last completed performance...he died while shooting his final film, "My Son John," in August, 1951.This role as Bruno was the performance of his career!Perfect in every way.The movie has been around now for nearly half a century. I see it every time it is shown on television, and I also watch the tape I have of it occasionally.Robert Walker's performance only seems to improve with each new viewing.I can not recommend this movie highly enough.If Hitchcock and Robert Walker can read me, up there in heaven, let me congratulate them both on an absolutely superlative job! </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still A Memorable Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Even though some unrealistic things happen at the end (i.e. a cop shooting a gun into a crowded merry-go-round where any number of innocent could be killed), this still was an intense, enjoyable thriller, one of Alfred Hitchcock's better films. Robert Walker is excellent as the chilling nutcase, really convincing giving a fascinating performance that is almost too creepy at times. His co-star in here, Farley Granger, is okay but is no match for Walker, either in acting or in the characters they play. It's the typical Hitchcock film with some strange camera angles, immoral themes, innocent man gets in trouble, etc. Unlike a lot of his other films, I thought this one was a fast-moving story with a very few dull spots. Being an ex-tennis player, I enjoyed his footage of some excellent old net matches that featured some good rallies. Hitchcock's real-life daughter Patricia has an interesting and unique minor character role in here. She didn't just get the job because of her dad; she can act. Also of note: the DVD has both the British and American versions and there were some differences in the story. This is a classic film that is still referred to in modern-day films, even comedies such as "Throw Momma Off The Train."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hitchcock's compelling and original suspense masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Looking back at the career of Alfred Hitchcock, it never fails to be surprising how such a brilliant and visionary man could be denied sufficient recognition for how revolutionary he was for the film industry. It is likely a sign of how ahead of his time Hitchcock was, always attempting to push the envelope, and never coasting along with a film made simply for the purpose of being entertaining, but always with a deeper, more poignant motive on his mind. Strangers on a Train, one of Hitchcock's first and more underrated hits, is a perfect example of these traits - an entertaining and suspenseful story, even when viewed over 50 years later, yes, but so carefully and intelligently constructed it stands today as a masterpiece in film technique. Arguably one of the pioneering "suspense thrillers", Strangers on a Train may come across as slightly dated in certain aspects, but it retains every bit of superbly crafted tension as it did back in 1951 (if perhaps slightly less shocking). The brilliant use of cinematography and lighting as well as quick, careful editing are what really make the film stand out, drawing out every possible iota of tension and retaining the audience's focus even in slower scenes. If there was ever any doubt of what a simply masterful filmmaker Hitchcock was, simply watching five minutes of Strangers on a Train should be enough to disavow such sentiments; every shot is so carefully chosen and constructed, all serving to drive the storyline ahead in a particularly innovative fashion. Sadly enough, there are certain moments in the story which are screechingly out of place enough to jar our focus away from the superb cinematography and editing - Bruno being able to reach down to the bottom of a sewer grate is simply unbelievable, and the figure of a stereotypical old man crawling under a wildly out of control carousel provides unintentional comedic relief in what is meant to be the film's most tense and engaging scene. These are only brief moments, but they are enough to stand out as painfully weak in an otherwise stellar film.But what really makes Strangers on a Train stand out is the story premise. As Hollywood films of late run the risk of descending inescapably further and further into the vat of turgid clichée after clichée, it's wonderfully refreshing to see a 50 year old film with a premise which actually comes across as smart and original. Sure it's fairly straightforward, but the concept of "swapping murders" is simply one that would not fly in films of today's day and age, which makes it all the more entertaining to watch; the film's brilliant screenplay keeps the action flowing at a swift pace while providing us with some wonderfully memorable lines all the while. One can't help but notice the deeper themes Hitchcock is alluding to throughout as well, especially the concept of "darkness in humanity's heart", demonstrated by elderly ladies being fascinated and exhilarated by the prospect of murder, as well as Bruno's own cavalier attitude towards death. Hitch also works in many moments of dark humour (Bruno popping a child's balloon with his cigarette is priceless), and irony, shooting suspenseful scenes in happy, easy-going environments, such as the iconic carnival scenes, to create an even more eerie atmosphere. This may be a suspense thriller, yes, but to overlook the brain concealed beneath it would be simply inexcusable. The antagonistic figure of Bruno (essayed to perverse perfection by Robert Walker, sadly in his last film role, but easily stealing the film from his admittably very talented fellow cast members) is without a doubt what makes Strangers on a Train so memorable, as the character is a marvel to behold. Here we have a simply superbly crafted villainous figure, all the more intriguing by how ordinary and unassuming he seems. Rather than cackling madly and thwarting the hero at every possible moment, Bruno is a calm, controlled, psychotic mess. He speaks of murder in such an offhand tone, yet retains a passionate glint in his eye when discussing different fashions of killing people. Bruno could seem to represent the "Id", as Freud would put it, the inner, darker and uninhibited aspects of mankind. It makes an interesting contrast to the hero figure, Guy Haines, and how bland and uninteresting he seems, almost as if to drive home the prospect of evil being much more interesting and appealing than constantly striving to do the right thing. Yet despite this implied message, Hitch still twists our emotions enough that we root for Guy at every turn, and cheer at each new obstacle he is forced to overcome. It's a testament to actor Farley Granger's talent that despite Robert Walker's villain easily stealing the show, Granger's hero still comes across as sympathetic, still commanding our support even when falling prey to being a far less compelling character. Superb support is given by Ruth Roman, who manages to overcome the clichée and be a more innovative and complex romantic interest figure, Kasey Rogers giving a stunning performance as Guy's horrifyingly manipulative and hedonistic first wife, and Patricia Hitchcock, proving that she is far more talented than being simply "the director's daughter" would imply. The superb cast (headed by a simply wonderful Walker) really bring the film to life, adding so much more merit to the film than simply Hitchcock's breathtaking stylistics. All in all, Strangers on a Train may still come across as slightly too dated for certain viewers, but it's still a shock how modern and appealing to contemporary audiences seems, considering it was released half a century ago. Once again, Hitchcock proves his unparalleled mastery of tension and film technique, and the film's surprisingly original and enjoyable premise is alone worth a viewing. Highly recommended to anyone wishing to undertake a brilliantly made but superbly entertaining film experience! -9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An interesting but largely forgotten Hitchcock entry</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Robert Walker is a rich, soft spoken (and possibly homosexual) psychopath who meets his apparent idol, a tennis player played by Farley Granger (who looks like Bernardo from "West Side Story"), and strikes up a conversation with him on a train. After managing lunch with him, Walker strikes up a conversation about "criss cross" murders: two men kill people who are enemies of the other man. Granger is dating a politician's daughter with hope of becoming a politician himself and is divorcing his prettier but unfaithful wife who got herself pregnant by another man. Walker proposes the possibility of killing the unfaithful wife, which Granger shrugs off as "crazy talk".Later, Granger tries to get his wife to sign some papers, but she reveals her evil plan to make it look like HE was cheating on HER and will try to pass off her illegitimate child as Granger's; odds are the other man left her. Granger is NOT happy. Later, the wife goes running around having a good time at a carnival with two younger men and she is stalked by Walker. After a lot of build up, black humor and creepy imagery, Walker sneaks up on the wife and strangles her to death.Walker then goes to Granger and tells him he killed his wife. Granger wasn't exactly fond of his wife, but he's appalled to learn that she's been murdered and that Walker ow expects Granger to murder his father (who suspects Walker of his devious doings, whereas his unsuspecting mother does not) in return for the favor. Thus begins a battle of wills wherein Walker torments Granger, his girlfriend and the others in his life, while concealing that he has Granger's cigarette lighter, which could incriminate Granger in his wife's murder if he places it back at the murder scene.Like many of Hitchcock's films, this features the usual assortment of distorted relationships between men and their mothers, badly portrayed authority figures, creepy imagery, black humor, flawed but essentially innocent men, and lots of observations about the darker side of human nature. An interesting film, but there are some lulls. Not that Hitchcock was perfect, but this one has more lulls than some of his other films, which, when combined with the lack of star power/big name actors that this film had starring in it, may attribute to why it is largely forgotten in light of films like "Rear Window", "To Catch A Thief", "North By Northwest", "Notorious", "The Man Who Knew Too Much", "Vertigo", "Psycho" and what not.Still, Walker is memorable as the film's killer, with his fey voice and intense gaze. At the time, he actually had the potential for a big career (he turned in some other less threatening performances in other films), but alas, fate was not on his side. One memorable image includes the murder being reflected in the wife's glasses. The climax on the merry go round is overkill though.One of my favorite quotes from the film comes between the girlfriend's sister and their father. Upon hearing of the wife's murder, the sister (played by Hitchcock's real life daughter) calls the wife "a tramp" (which may have been true) and the father reprimands her with "She was a human being. Even the lowest of us are entitled to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness." The daughter retorts "She pursued it in five different directions."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hitchcock suspense drama has great style but lots of dross...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Robert Walker admirably goes all out as a psychotic daddy-hater who befriends tennis pro Farley Granger and discovers the rather naive young man hates his estranged wife; Walker suggests swapping murders. Lots of intricate plotting in the set-up, but this Alfred Hitchcock thriller is relieved of tension by its banalities, such as the vapid dialogue, an overlong tennis sequence near the finale, and silly situations like the one where Walker "cleverly" winds up in his father's bed when Granger arrives. The frenzied finale plays well, but with some afterthought you may notice how emotionally hollow it is, what with an innocent, elderly carnival worker getting shot dead by the police (!) and nobody seems to care. Flamboyant, if over-the-top, performances, a great deal of style in the usual Alfred Hitchcock fashion, but not much substance. **1/2 from ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rich and entertaining premium Hitchcock</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A wonderful, rich and entertaining film. It manages to be just about all things to all men: a noirish thriller, but with plenty of humour; a matinée feature with iconic set pieces (the tennis match and the final fairground showdown) and a handsome cast led by an unspeakably beautiful Ruth Roman. The acting is good and to some depth. Robert Walker's schemer Bruno Anthony sets the standard the others follow. Farley's tennis chump (sic) Guy Haines (a character he's recycled from the earlier Rope) is likable but bubbleheaded enough to maintain the suspense; I also liked Patricia Hitchcock's Bobbie soxer sister to Roman, a good foil for Farley's character (and reminiscent of Barbara Bel Geddes' homely Midge opposite James Stewart's Scottie in Vertigo).What I hadn't expected is the homoerotic character, not only explicit in Walker's Bruno, but also throughout the action as a strong concurrent subtext. Once I had the idea in my head that Hitchcock intended the film as a homosexual tragedy, I found it difficult to shift. Of course, it's no more than subtext, albeit a pervasive one (it's 1951 after all) but the psychosis of the queer character moves fluidly between the surface action and the implication of his relationship with Haines. It also serves as a way of explaining Haines' perplexing procrastination in involving the authorities ? perhaps Bruno's behaviour is that of the sexual blackmailer. As I say, such readings breed themselves. Anyway, any sympathy that Hitchcock might have been seen to be harbouring towards the orientation of Bruno, if not the character himself gets tied up neatly at the end with Haines decisively removed from the 'danger' and getting the girl.Hitchcock seems imperiously in control of his ideas and technique in this film. I was particularly taken with a sequence at a party. He successfully shows five different, well-developed characters all benighted to different degrees and coming to their own conclusions without any need for dialogue, both racking up tension and pushing the drama forward. There's very little to take issue with here. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Strangers on a Train - a Review by Jo Henshaw</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Lets swap Murders- your wife, my father"- seemingly innocent conversation between two strangers - Bruno Anthony and Guy Haines when they meet over lunch on a train journey. Guy, a solid, respectable tennis player, whose problem is that his wife, the flirtatious Miriam, won't divorce him so he can marry senators daughter Anne, laughs the whole conversation off as a joke. The following week he isn't laughing any more. In a scene of classic Hitchcock suspense, Bruno stalks Miriam through a carnival and strangles her. As he does, her glasses fall off and we see the murder eerily reflected twice through her lenses. Cold hearted and amoral Bruno, his part of the deal completed, approaches an appalled Guy expecting, even pressuring him into 'doing his bit.' Matters are not helped when Anne's precocious and outspoken younger sister turns up suspecting Guy of Miriam's murder. So accused of a murder he didn't commit and expected to commit another, what is Guy going to do? The power of this film is in the presentation of human beings as having a murderous side to their nature - and this Hitchcock does to perfection.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the most critical work of Alfred Hitchcock!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Once Alfred Hitchcock said that good movie requires three things, good script, good script and good script. Surely this thing is very much depicted in this movie. The movie is about a tennis player (Fraley Granger) who has an unfaithful wife and a beautiful girlfriend. In the train he meets with a stranger (Robert Walker) who is infatuated to kill his father. Farley tells him about his chronics and casually stranger offers a very compelling proposal that I kill yours and you kill mine. And that the point where Hitchcock captivates his audience. Hitchcock had handled the neurotic sense of the movie immaculately and it mesmerizes you till the end of the movie. All the cast performed very well and the plot was very persuasive. No doubt its one of the best works of Hitchcock and for Hitchcock fans it's very much indulging.</fullReview>

Granger's a semi-public figure, he's a tennis pro, but not an especially high one. High enough however for him to know that Granger is trapped in a loveless marriage and would like to be free to marry Ruth Roman.So when they meet as complete Strangers On A Train one afternoon, Walker knows enough that Granger will at least be intrigued enough with the possibility that if the two of them, complete strangers, did commit homicide on parties that the other would be convenienced by their demise. Though Granger is repulsed by the idea, one of the beautiful things about this film, is that you can see in the performance he gives that Granger just might submit to temptation.In fact when Walker kills Laura Elliot, Granger's wife whose been two timing him and even gotten pregnant by another man, he expects that Granger will in turn murder Walker's father so that Walker can inherit his estate. Today Walker would be called a trust fund baby and a pretty malevolent one at that.Alfred Hitchcock directed Walker to his career role, ironically in his last complete film. Walker died the following year with most of My Son John finished. Hitchcock does not do too bad by Farley Granger either. Of course when Granger does balk at committing homicide on people who never did anything to him, the tension. Strangers On A Train is also characterized by great editing, first in the tennis match in which Granger has to finish the match and waylay Walker before he plants evidence convicting Granger at the crime scene. And also in that final climax with a fight on a runaway carousel between Walker and Granger.Strangers On A Train is Hitchcock at his best, it should not be missed and ought to be required viewing when film classes study editing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's 'all change' for the final act.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Strangers on a Train boasts a neat central idea (the 'swapping' of murders), several classic Hitchcockian moments, and a fine performance from Robert Walker as psychotic socialite Bruno; but despite these admirable qualities the film fails to qualify as a complete success thanks to a severely flawed final act that makes one wonder what the hell Hitch was thinking.Farley Granger's tennis-pro Guy Haines being coerced into discussing murder by charismatic lunatic Bruno?all well and good. The nutter carrying out his side of the plan as discussed?great stuff. Haines afraid to go to the police for fear of being implicated in a murderous pact with a clearly deranged Bruno?hey, why not? People don't always make the wisest of decisions when under pressure.The whole ridiculous fairground finale, however, cannot be so easily brushed aside. Bruno develops telescopic arms, the police act like bumbling trigger-happy fools, and a merry-go-round achieves warp-speed before a toothless old guy confuses a self-destruct lever for the brake. It's like something out of a fever-dream?illogical, perplexing and utterly deranged?a dreadful way to end what was proving to be a very enjoyable thriller.6.5 out of 10, rounded up to 7 for IMDb.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mediocre thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Once again, Strangers On A Train is symptomatic of Hitchcock's cinema, along with movies like Vertigo or North By Northwest: it has an interesting potential but ultimately it doesn't live up to the expectation.To begin with, the premise is a bit far-fetched. Even if one puts aside this aspect, the script still doesn't hold up: after a good start, the movie struggles and goes in circles after barely 45 minutes. Yet, there were a lot of possibilities, and one would have liked, for example, to get to know Bruno's character more, who is ultimately quite superficial despite being central to the plot.Moreover, while in other Hitchcock movies the form compensates for the content, here even the direction, editing or soundtrack struggle to make up for the lack of a solid script. Some scenes, such as the sewer scene or the final carousel scene, are ridiculous. The music is also badly used as a joyful melody sometimes plays during a suspenseful scene like the confrontation between Anne and Bruno.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's not a good movie, at least by my standards</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is my first review, and I'm 34 years old. Often I don't agree with the high ratings young moviegoers shower the latest vapid blockbusters, but I understand they love it and they have the right to their opinion. Conversely, I really disliked Strangers on a Train and I feel my opinion is similarly valid. Being in the IMDb's top 250 with a rating of 8+ I approached this movie expecting a masterpiece, but in the end felt feed a bunch of crap.It started off decently enough, suspense building slowly like I would expect from the genre's master director. But after the first part of movie's unusual premise is completed, things fall apart. The characters' actions don't feel realistic and several scenes made me "wake up" from the movie's universe as they didn't feel real. Also I felt the movie dragged on forever. I was bored, and I can usually endure some pretty non-eventful developments before I get bored.The end felt fake, phony and completely forced. I felt like I was watching a B horror movie and (almost?) started laughing at how ridiculously bad it all looked. Maybe at the time the movie was a masterpiece, I don't know. But my rating is made today and I utterly don't recommend it. 4/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Strangely, quite lame</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Robert Walker's performance as Bruno Anthony is marvelous and makes the movie worth watching - but that is the only thing positive about this mess of movie.Some details are just plain forced - such as anything to do with the ornate cigarette lighter that the tennis star originally has with him (even though he "doesn't smoke much".) This lighter plays a pivotal role throughout the movie.Much of the dialog is bad, particulary the various police detectives and the police chief - and most people have English accents (it takes place in America).The announcer at the tennis game is so bad he is funny, as is the exaggerated way the crowd watches the game - although I appreciate the effect.Finally, although I could forgive some of the silliness, the final scene at the amusement park was so ludicrous as to make this movie an unintentional laugher.Nice thing about the DVD is it has both the US version and UK version. Not a lot of difference, although the absolute final scene that is in the American version makes it a bit better. Sorry, Hitch, although there were minor moments and a few great shots, to have this movie as #85 or whatever in IMDB's top movies is unrealist.3/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I know its a little weird that I broke into your house in the middle of the night, but I am only here to tell you that your own son is an absolute lunatic. And I have a gun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Overall Strangers on a train is a good movie, with amazing cinematography, suspense and a good plot. Obviously it is a classic, which might be the reason why reviews here are so overly positive. Brunos character is well thought and acted out. The rest of the characters are a little flat and react as you would expect them to for most of the film. Yes, the tennis scene might be a little long, but then again the film was made a long time ago. By then films had longer shots and scene, a slower pace, no cgi and in general less graphic detail. So for its time, I believe the tennis scene is brilliant at building suspense.But what really is the big big flaw of strangers on a train, is that there continue to be scenes that don't seem to make any sense whatsoever and are quite disturbing to watch. Most people here didn't seem to notice that, though:-It already starts off a bit shaky(but still relatively OK compared to what is still to come) when Bruno kills the wife. For some reason he chooses a carnival as the crime scene. Lots of people, light and not exactly great for an escape. He doesn't seem to mind following her the whole time, by which point her company must have noticed him and would be great witnesses. Although his escape by boat may seem a little inconvenient, he is lucky and nobody seems to mind that he just boats back from the island where people are yelling for help and he can just walk away from the crime scene.-So then Bruno(being a crazy sob) nearly strangles another woman to death at a party. However, in a social group where just days a ago a woman was strangled to death, again nobody really seems to mind this coincidence and Bruno is not a suspect.-Then Bruno pushes Guy to kill his father, so Guy breaks into the house. But then as sort of the twist, Guy is not there to actually kill him, but just to talk to him. At this point it really stops to make any sense. Why would he break into his house in the middle of the night and sneak around just to tell him that, instead of calling him first like a normal person? Why on earth would he bring a gun?!-But... the father is not there and instead its one of Brunos traps. So, what is Guys first reaction? He puts the gun right next to the crazy person and actually tells him that he is crazy and will probably go to jail. Luckily Bruno is very concerned about mother, so Guy doesn't get shot.-However, the showdown really takes the cake! The (trained) police men decide to open fire on the merry-go-round(you know, the fast moving thing with all the kids(!) on it) and kill the operator. So, naturally the merry-go-round turns into a killer machine and the little kids ride starts operating at highway speeds. Next a crazy old dude crawls under the merry-go-round as the only hope of stopping this monster machine, because there simply seems to be no other way to turn it off. By this point we are already in far too deep and returning to sanity would be a little confusing. So the next logical step is ... of course... an exploding merry-go-round!! The villain dies tragically and Guy is again the good straight-up guy. Not exactly much of an ending.Overall, a good film with a lot of very big flaws. I was a little disappointed at times.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very good Hitch film about a tennis champion who becomes involved with psychopath in exchange killings</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Top-notch Hitch film dealing with a girl in love with young America's idol , a Tennis star named Guy Haines who becomes involved with a good-looking stranger , Bruno Anthony, in search of sensation that's how it all began..! Warner Bros bring a pounding new tempo to motion picture entertainment. A psychotic socialite (Robert Walker as unforgettable psycho) confronts a pro tennis star (Farley Granger) with a theory on how two complete strangers can get away with murder...a theory that he plans to implement . Guy Haines meets a stranger on the Washington-to-New York train who offers to exchange murders. The stranger will kill Guy's estranged wife if Guy will murder Bruno's hated father. Guy doesn't take Bruno seriously until his spouse , Miriam (Laura Elliott), is found killed in an amusement park . Guy becomes the chief suspect, which threatens his tennis career and his romantic involvement with a U.S. senator (Leo G. Carroll)'s daughter (Ruth Roman) .Hitchcock first visited Hollywood in 1940, but was turned down by virtually all major motion picture studios because they thought he could not make a "Hollywood" picture. He was finally offered a seven-year directing contract by producer David O. Selznick. His first project was supposed to be a film about the Titanic, but Selznick scrapped the project because he "couldn't find a boat to sink." Selznick assigned Hitch to direct Rebeca (1940) instead, which later won the Best Picture Oscar . Later on , Hitchcock shot ¨Strangers on a train¨.Tense/suspense/mystery abounds in this thriller from Hithcock who combines the elements of intrigue with romance, drama and action . Thrilling and interesting screenplay based on a Patricia Highsmith novel and co-scripted by novelist Raymond Chandler and uncredited the prestigious Ben Hecht . Robert Walker and Farley Granger give their finest acting as psychopath and tennis star respectively . Hitchock married Alma Reville , usually screenwriter ,and had one daughter, Patricia Hitchcock, who appeared in several of his movies: Stage fright (1950), and Psicosis (1960) and Strangers on the train where she plays splendidly the distrusted sister .Frequent collaborator the director of photography Robert Burks creates a stunning cinematography . Suspenseful and atmospheric original music by the classic Dimitri Tiomkin.Hitchcock often used the ¨false guilty¨ or "wrong man" or "mistaken identity" theme in his movies Sabotage (1942), I confess (1953), Wrong man (1956), North by Northwest (1959), Frenesí (1972) and of course Stranger on a train . In a lot of his films -more noticeably in the early black and white American films-, he used to create more shadows on the walls to create suspense and tension . Hitch hated to shoot on location , he preferred to shoot at the studio where he could have full control of lighting and other factors. Rating : Above average , well worth watching . This good thriller by the master himself, who preys on the senses and keeps the suspense at feverish pitch . Worthwhile seeing thanks some Hitch's touches .</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Guy and Ann are beautiful but dull. Far more interesting are the weird Bruno, his wacko mother, Ann's unusual sister Barbara (played brilliantly by PatHitchcock), the lovely Mrs Cunningham, and Miriam, Guy's first wife. Miriam is irritating and dim as well as amoral, but she's also rather sexy and seems to be having a much better time slouching around a run-down carnival in dead-endMetcalf than the Mortons ever have sipping drinks with the elite in theirmansion. Guy has used tennis as a ticket out of Metcalf, and used his goodlooks to climb the social ladder, so now he can marry the boss's daughter and go into politics. What a comfortably tedious life spreads out before him! Let's hope bizarre Barbara at least escapes. Perhaps she'll find happiness with the policeman, Hennessy? xxxxxxxx</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film could have been shot without a word of dialogue - it may have been better had it been. What's good about the film? There are some nice camera set-ups and locations or simulated locations, and some nice black and white photography. That's about it. The plot is completely artificial, with gaps as wide as a barn door.The scriptwriting is totally uninspired; an implausible story might have been raised to some interesting artistic or imaginative plain by strong dialogue and characterisation, but there is next to none. In the superfluous features accompanying this set it is interesting to note how much the commentators have to say about the character of Bruno the murderer's mother. The character makes two fairly brief appearances in film, so why so much interest? Because the excellent actor invests this small part with something human: she IS almost the only character in the film worth talking about. The rest are puppets.Hitchcock did a number of films that are extremely dehumanised, i.e. bereft of sympathy for or interest in human complexity (as opposed to human frailty and absurdity). In these films - and this is a prime example - people are manipulated by plot contrivances, camera angles and location/set dynamics and have little or no motive force. Some will say this is the Hitchcockian perspective. Harnessed to better stories and better actors (e.g. I Confess, The Wrong Man, Sabotage, Suspicion, Marnie), the perspective can deliver genuine suspense and human interest. Indulged for its own sake, with something approaching contempt for plot coherence and characterisation, it is dreary. I have seen this film several times, always looking for something I might have missed, but it delivers less, not more, with repeated viewings.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Game,Set,Match to Robert Walker</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I always thought that Robert Walker was a lightweight and happened to be Jennifer Jones' husband and that was about the extent of it. Then I saw "Strangers On A Train" and his performance in that film changed my mind and how!! His dark, perverse character is the epitome of evil with a smiling face. He oozes through this film like a bad dream and is your worst nightmare. The story, from the book by Patricia Highsmith, is well adapted from the original and may even be better. I read the book after seeing the movie and I was biased by the images from the film that kept popping before my eyes. Farley Granger, who never was one of my favorites is all wrong for the part of Guy Haines. Hitchcock insisted on using him (see "Rope")....he obviously saw something in him. His personality is so unattractive that it makes you wonder how Ruth Roman could ever be in love with him. He is the perfect victim for Walker, and is a weakling who won't even go to the police when the murder swapping scenario begins. Some of the images in this film are quite striking.....the reflection in the victim's glasses, the tennis match where everyone is watching the ball except Walker, and the fingers groping in the drain for the lighter. Pure Hitchcock. Poor Robert Walker never got the chance to follow up this wonderful performance due to his untimely death and the promise he showed here as a villain may have taken him to greater characterizations. This may not be one of Hitchcock's best films but it certainly should be on everyone's list as a must-see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprises You the Second Time, in the Details</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is such a revered and studied film, a classic among Hitchcock's many, it takes no cajoling to want to watch it again. Yet you think: can it hold up even when the huge (and clever, and amazing) trick of the plot is no surprise?Yes.And for starters there is the start, a profoundly beautiful and slick telling of the really the whole story, the gist of it. Two taxis, two men shown with their shoes, each walking onto the train, sitting then across from each other, and, oops, a mistake, a little nudge, and the conversation begins, and we see the men themselves. They are interchangeable. The tone here is characteristic of Hitchcock, as it is in many horror and suspense films-- cheery and light. We know entering the film, however, that this won't be the case, so already we are worried. What, after all, is about to go wrong?A lot. In truly Hitchcock fashion, it is a purely innocent man (nearly always a man) who faces injustice, who is trapped by circumstance threatening what is most valuable to him. The innocent in this case, tennis player Guy Haynes, is played with an innocence that is believable--his collegiate politeness in that first scene, for example, as he realizes the other man is a little cuckoo, is just what you or I might do. The not-so-innocent man is the self- absorbed and scarily intelligent spoiled child, Bruno Anthony, played with utter brilliance by Robert Walker. (This uncanny performance is equivalent to that of another Hitchcock wacko, played by Anthony Perkins in Psycho.) So from scene one, on the train (and the train, really gorgeous!), we have the two leads and we have the mind-blowing and utterly simple and ultimately devastating plot, from the first novel by Patricia Highsmith, who also wrote the books behind the two Mr. Ripley movies. And it doesn't hurt that the screenplay was co- written by Raymond Chandler himself, who knows something about economy and clever dialog. And crime.And of course there is more than just the first scene. What to note? Well, that smarty of a senator's daughter (I thought she was terrific) is Hitchcock's daughter, Patricia, who is still with us (as of 2009; she also had a role in Psycho). And there is a characteristic landmark location for a key scene in the film--the tennis courts in the Hamptons, known to us as the site of the U.S. Open. The fantastic last full scene with the carousel is the only place where Hitchcock moves into a kind of slow and steady montage, building up the suspense by making it surreal. The fear gets positively fattening with the laughing children and the old man crawling underneath it all. And when it collapses in a crash--that's all backprojected on a set, one of the more naturalistic uses by a director known for not worrying about the realism of his back projections.The photography is that perfect Hollywood stunning without becoming so stylized (as in some noir films) that it is an object in its own right. Look again at the first scene, or the shooting (and editing) of Haynes entering the house for what the audience thinks is a murder. This is sophisticated construction. When we are not completely surprised that it's Bruno in the bed, that only proves that the director has us on our toes. Something unexpected is always expected.Are there glitches? Who knows? It depends on what kind of falseness you can accept (or embrace) as beautiful style. The scene where Bruno is choking the old woman at a party is both brilliant (the woman, played by Norma Varden, is a caricature so believable it takes your breath away) and marred by his looking at the senator's daughter and being triggered into a deadly trance by her glasses, and her resemblance to his earlier victim. This is a mid-20th Century idea of psychology that intrudes on many of Hitchcock's efforts. (The end of Psycho, for starters.)The Wikipedia article on the film smartly emphasizes the consistent doubling of things in the movie, from the main characters to the murder victim and the senator's daughter. This echoes in lots of little ways--two men trail him to the tennis court, two men accompany the victim to the amusement park, and so on. There can be too much made of this, but it does supply an aesthetic consistency above and below our consciousness. Don't forget, there are meant to be two murders--it is the lack of the second murder, the inability to create a doubling in that case, that causes Bruno to unravel.Walker the actor had emotional problems and was institutionalized in the year before this movie was shot, and just afterwards, he died from a reaction to a drug used to calm one of his outbursts. Though he appeared in other films, Strangers on a Train is easily his tour-de- force. Farley Granger had a long career that never quite saw him break into true stardom, though his style can have a peculiar nervous sweetness that really works, especially in They Live by Night. And if you watch this one for the first or third time, do look for the chilling and hilarious scene at the tennis match where the crowd's heads all move back and forth in unison-- except for Bruno's. He is staring out without moving his head straight at us. As the trailer for the movie says, after this movie, you won't be talking to "strangers on a train."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Morality Play/Study in Ethics</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have used this movie in my college Ethics courses for over 10 years (also Woody Allen's "Crimes and Misdemeanors"--another terrific, multi-leveled ethical study). It's fiction. I don't focus too much on the unrealistic features of "Strangers" because all fictional films are obviously false on many levels. I love the film as gallows comedy, tautly told, with many ironic twists and visual pleasures--even if it's "unbelievable." The story is told so well that I don't even think of criticizing its plausibility (although I must confess that the tennis match seems the weakest part to me--too much Hollywood fluff and not enough real tennis competition).Some problems presented in the film that hold promise for realistic moral education and ethical discussion:1. Ethical Passivity: some weaknesses of the Guy character are intended by Hitchcock. A primary ethical insight of the film is the danger of inability to articulate one's moral positions. Guy is unable to effectively block Bruno's crazy proposals at the start. An interesting question is why and how does Guy behave so passively, ineffectively? A possible answer is his depression because of his intense and complicated divorce process. 2. Miscommunication: Guy commits another failure at the start: on the train, to get away quickly, he agrees that Bruno's ideas are all good. But Guy's literal meaning is opposite to his inflected, sarcastic meaning. Bruno takes the literal meaning as an agreement for the criss-cross murders. Guy takes the sarcastic meaning as an escape from any murder agreement. To some extent, near the beginning, Bruno may be partially pretending that an agreement has been struck, to draw Guy further into a web of complicity. Bruno is manipulating Guy; Guy's linguistic ambiguity on the train gives Bruno a chance to put an ethical "stranglehold" on Guy. Bruno manipulating Guy may also take on other meanings . . . .3. Secrecy: Some have speculated about a sexual relationship between Guy and Bruno. It seems at first ridiculous, especially since Guy appears obviously heterosexual in his relationships with Miriam and Anne. However, remember that Guy is also ineffective with both women. Guy appears (stereotypically--it's 1951 remember) effeminate, especially in relationship to Bruno. Guy, the strong athlete, is weak on the inside. Bruno is also conflicted (playing "against himself"), appearing facially and physically strong at first but then displaying some "effeminate" traits (Bruno's fashion and footwork; his gushing emotionally to Guy in different situations; his receiving a manicure from his doting mother; Bruno kissing and desperately fondling his mother's hand; other more subtle gay stereotypes that hold cryptic meaning from Hitchcock's point of view). I wish I could hear Hitchcock clarify his intended meanings here.4. Dishonesty and Distrust: Guy makes some colossal blunders in hiding truths about Bruno from family and from police. Guy fails to fully comprehend that admitting fault quickly may be better than a cover-up or a delay in confession. Again Guy is driven by passivity, insecurity, fear--and perhaps a self-hate that is closer to Bruno's own self-loathing than we care to see or to admit. Both Guy and Bruno act out their own parables of impotence.5. Lack of Evidence: Guy feels a problem mustering the evidence to acquit himself. While quickly going to the police would solve a huge problem, Guy traps himself with his own doubts and insecurities: the absence of desired alibis; the inability of the alcoholic professor to testify on Guy's behalf; the obsessive need to appear politically pristine; and other personality factors that cause Guy to feel defenseless. He is as dysfunctional as Bruno--just not as dangerous (yet one could partially blame Guy for Miriam's murder).6. Disease and Mental Disorder: an interesting question is how legally responsible is Bruno for the murders? The more ethically incompetent Bruno is as a sick sociopath, the more guilty Guy may be as someone healthy who failed to stand up and morally act to prevent the crimes. Guy's failure is like a man who fails to call the police when a sick friend threatens suicide, and death ensues. One could argue that more than one crime is committed and that Guy is an emotionally hobbled accomplice.These and many other features of the film make "Strangers on a Train" a gem of a morality play, a diamond for philosophical and cinematic reflections.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I know it's Hitchcock, I know it's considered a classic, and I know it's near 100 on the IMDb Top 250.But that doesn't mean it's a good movie.The setup is perfect; the psychotic Bruno Anthony follows a local sports hero (Guy Haines) onto a train, and strikes up a one-sided conversation about trading murders. The tennis pro wants nothing to do with it, but dismisses the conversation out of hand.The murder of Guy's wife is also done well, although it is here where things get murky...how did he follow them for an hour without the other two men noticing him? After that, the premise falls apart completely. How could Guy not go to the police immediately? Why didn't he go after Bruno sent the evidence to his house? Why didn't the cops ask the man running the Tunnel Of Love about Guy, or anyone else for that matter? Why did the whole expected frame of Guy depend on his lighter being taken to the exact place? And finally, why the hell would a police officer SHOOT DIRECTLY INTO A CHILDREN'S RIDE AND KILL THE OPERATOR! Which led to the inevitable deus ex machina with Bruno being killed as the calliope fell to the ground, holding the incriminating cigarette lighter...As I said, the setup was perfect, and I will admit Bruno is one of the most disturbing characters I've seen on film (as Guy is perhaps the stupidest), but the second and third acts were so bad, it couldn't make up for a great beginning.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Implausible and Boring; Catnip for Misanthropes and Misogynists</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Strangers on a Train" has style to burn but negligible brain or heart. It is a black and white classic chock full of vintage cars, clothing, mixed drinks, and scenes so calculated you can hear the clockwork go "tick tock tick tock." Its implausible premise: an obnoxious heir, Bruno Antony, (Robert Walker) meets Guy Haines, (Farley Granger) a tennis pro, on a train, and without so much as a how-do-you-do, tells Guy that he wants Guy to murder his, Bruno's, father. In exchange, Bruno will murder Guy's wife so that Guy can marry his hot girlfriend, the senator's daughter, Anne Morton (Ruth Roman). Guy's personal life is known to Bruno because Guy is a sports celebrity.In real life, of course, anyone with a three digit IQ would simply say to Bruno the madman, "Excuse me," stand up, and walk away. Guy does not, and the movie never offers any interesting reason why Guy loyally sticks by Bruno, as if they were old army buddies and Bruno had once saved Guy's life. This total lack of any plausibility makes the movie boring for the viewer seeking insight into human behavior.Hitchcock's films are always implausible. No one believes that Cary Grant and Eva Marie Saint could really walk across the faces on Mount Rushmore, as they did in "North by Northwest." As Hitchcock liked to point out, "North by Northwest" isn't even a real compass point. The whole point of that movie was not to tell a real story, but to put a very handsome and charismatic star, Cary Grant, in tension-inducing settings, none of which you can ever really believe, but all of which you can enjoy.With "Strangers on a Train," though, Hitchcock's signature implausibility and style are there, but there's nothing enjoyable to watch on screen ? unless ? and it is a big unless ? you are a misanthrope and a misogynist who harbors murderous tendencies and finds people too stupid to be endured. If you can identify with Bruno, and if you like to fantasize about killing people, and if you think that other people are so stupid that they deserve to be murdered by you, and that they aren't smart enough to realize what you are up to, I think this might be your favorite movie. Guy's complete idiocy would strike you as convincing. That Bruno can all but strangle to death an idiotically smiling and nodding society matron at a black-tie party just a short while after he strangled Guy's wife in an amusement park, a murder that has not yet been solved, and that no police would arrest, or even interrogate Bruno after he strangled this matron, in full view of the important people in town, would strike you as completely believable.The fun for "Strangers on a Train"'s fans is watching Bad Boy Bruno do bad things and in watching the rest of the population let Bruno get away with doing bad things, because they are too stupid or too passive or too lazy or too bewitched to intervene. You have to have a very dim view of humanity to find that convincing, or even a good time.An unexpected pleasure in the film: Ruth Roman. Ruth Roman's celebrity has not outlasted her career; even fans of Golden Age movies are unlikely to worship at her shrine, selecting more obvious goddesses like Bette, Joan, Katharine, Greta, or Marilyn. Roman starred mostly in B pictures and no one movie is all hers. She is very beautiful and also quite fascinating here, though, as if visiting from a far better movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A setup gone so wrong</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In short, here is how I feel about watching this movie due to it's "tempting" synopsis: I was conned, and I wish I had seen the negative reviews on this movie before I actually watched it.The setup of the movie was perfect; exactly what I was anticipating, two people on a train who are completely random strangers are talking; one of them being a society's typical norm of a "menace" (Bruno) approaches the society's typical norm of a "law abiding citizen" (Guy), sort of speak. The menace goes on to tell the guy that he would kill the other guy's wife, in exchange of the other guy killing his father. And the story goes on, based on that idea.Guy's wife was being "accompanied" by two men in an amusement park, they then lose her in a dark place for - at most - two minutes, in which Bruno kills her by strangling her. Thing is, the two guys have noticed Bruno following them a few times, yet, after knowing she was murdered they had given no statements of Bruno whatsoever? This point was not even reviewed in this so called "mystery" genre movie, these two guy's statements literally never existed in the movie, just completely ignored by the plot writer. And this is what I hate about this movie: "OH DID YOU THINK THIS WOULD WORK? HAHA NO BECAUSE IM GOING TO NOT MAKE IT WORK.", I think that 's exactly what was in the mind of the plot writer as he went through with it, he kept making so much points and then invalidating them, that the movie was a practical bore and annoying, how can you enjoy a movie when every important point becomes suddenly disdained because of a "coincidencial" event? Too much "coincidences" occur that at one point of the movie I thought "I f**king hate this movie" and I went for a smoke, here is a list off the top of my head of points that were made, then disdained because the writer simply wanted to:1. The murder: Two guys were watching Bruno follow Guy's wife in the park, yet somehow did not give their statements (this was previously explained hence I won't go into details.)2. The alibi: Guy's alibi was that he was speaking to a professor at a train during the time of the murder. He was able to recall the name of the professor and the professor was actually called to the station, yet somehow had forgotten the man that he had JUST MET yesterday. Also, the fuss over him not having a proper alibi was because "He might have seen the man and then caught a later train, hence having enough time to murder his wife.". Question is, how did he know the man's name through his face? Does the tennis player know a list of professors who live in different cities/towns?3. The lighter: Goodness gracious! Really? This? First let me explain why this was so important: Bruno says, he would take the lighter to the police station and say that this lighter he was asked by Guy to pick up from the murder scene so that his name would be clear, which would work because Guy has been seen talking to Bruno after the murder. However, a simple "This guy is a menace, he said he would kill my wife in exchange of me killing his father. He read about me in magazines and actually killed my wife and is now pushing me to kill his father. I did give him the lighter in the train. I can even prove that he's the killer, I'm sure someone must've seen him in the amusement park.". I mean, anyone with one digit IQ would have been able to say that, right? Now the heart-breaker, the whole movie revolves around this. I had to watch around 100 minutes with this point being the main point in the plot, it is incredibly annoying and sad to watch such a weak motive become the main point.4. The mother of all clichés, the tennis match and the lighter falling in the sewers: Guy's plan was to finish the tennis match by winning 3 sets in a row, to get to the park just in time to meet Bruno there and confront him, then take his lighter from him. Seriously, this was the mastermind, Guy's, plan to overtake Bruno. Guy loses his third set and starts losing time, BUT WAIT, Bruno somehow drops the lighter into the sewers and attempts to grab hold of it (sub-cliche 1). Guy keeps losing and time keeps passing, BUT WAIT, Bruno pushes the lighter deeper unintentionally (sub-cliche 2). Guy then wins the match, and Bruno retrieves the lighter.5. The final fight in the amusement park: Many many things are wrong here. Police shooting in a carousel with children in it, and killing an innocent man? Bruno trying to kill Guy, yet after when the fight is over, they do not even try to guess why, they literally don't even ask "Why were you fighting him?" or "Who is he?". Or when the lighter drops from Bruno's hand and then suddenly everyone believes Guy; their opinion changes so fast I could swear the only reason why that happened was because they didn't have enough tape to shoot.And another very important thing that I hate most: How on earth does someone who wishes murder for someone else get the happy ending, like Guy was for his wife's murder? And if anyone would think he wasn't happy for her death I'd ask you this: What was Guy's reaction to know his wife was killed?It's a waste of time, people. Unless if you're willing to know how a plot shouldn't be made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Strangers on a Train is good, but not Hitchcock's finest</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Strangers on a Train is yet another great psychological thriller from director legend Alfred Hitchcock. The film might not be among Hitchcock's most famous and recognized thrillers but it contains all of the director legend's trademarks; excellent directing far ahead of its time and a story filled with mystery, intensity and suspense.Strangers on a Train tells about a chance encounter on a train which entangles two vastly different character's and their destinies' together. Guy Heines (Farley Granger) is a promising young tennis player in love crisis with his blackmailing ex-wife unwilling to allow him to pursue happiness with another woman. On a train ride Guy encouters a seemingly harmless gentleman, Bruno Anthony (Robert Walker) who has a morbid solution for Guy's problem. As Guy shrugs off Bruno and his crazy plan to commit a perfect murder, little does Guy know that Bruno in his delusional mind is fully committed in going through with his homicidal plan.I liked Strangers on a Train especially Robert Walker's portrayal of mentally unstable Bruno made a permanent impression and would go as far as to say that he is the highlight of Strangers on a Train leaving other actors completely in his shadow. Story wise the Strangers on a Train is quite typical Hitchcock film as the director has always been master in creating suspense out of ordinary characters who find them in most unordinary situations. This is especially true with Strangers on a Train as it begans slowly with seemingly unengaging story and characters but in no time the viewer is fully immersed and engaged in Hitchcock's mystery. There was a phase around middle of the running time where I felt that the story made no real progress and the intensity dropped somewhat, but thankfully the film managed to pick up the intensity towards the end climax.In the end Strangers on a Train in my books is not among Hitchcock's best thrillers, but it is still a very good film and I doubt anybody who enjoys a good psychological thriller would say otherwise.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bravura performance by tragic villain</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I hadn't been aware of Robert Walker before catching this classic on TCM this summer. He stole every scene in this incredible movie -- how 'bout that face in the crowd during the tennis match? -- and he made murder itself entertaining! I looked Walker up on Wikipedia and was sad to see that he had suffered nervous breakdowns; in fact, his nervous condition proved the death of him at age 33 in 1951, the year this movie came out. (Is this a twist worthy of Hitchcock?) The Walker character was supremely thought-provoking. Had he somehow set up the initial encounter on the train, perhaps because he was attracted to the tennis player? His criss-cross scheme was ingenious but he was a very clever (though psychopathic) guy; surely he didn't think this preppy guy had the makings of a murderer. Was the criss-cross simply a means for stalking a guy he desired? Was Bruno Anthony suicidal as well as seductive? It seemed so when he greeted Farley from his absent father's bed.Anyway...A couple things in this movie raised questions, though less intriguingly. What was the fixation with women wearing glasses? Could their look have been so unusual back then? Also, no judgment in the least was passed concerning the senator's daughter being involved with pretty boy Farley. Everyone from the Senator to his nerdy younger daughter were completely OK with it. I can see that in a modern movie but back in the Fifties?? Also, what appears to be a major disaster occurs at the end of the film, in a crowded, wrecked merry-go-round. Are we to presume that kids were killed as a plot device? The fact that the scene is dropped with no followup at all was jarring to me.RIP, Mr. Walker?.and Bravo!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Thrilling Hitchcock Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alfred Hitchcock is a genius of a filmmaker whose every film has a daring vision to it even if they are not all as satisfying or as complete as another. This is one of his best about obsession and chance meetings. The title pretty much sums up the plot, which goes that two men meet on a train, by chance, and one of them hatches a plan for murder. It would solve both their problems and be the perfect murder since there would be no motive. Problem is that one is not as obsessed with killing as the other and is in his "right mind" although in a Hitchcock film that is kind of an iffy term as everyone is not quite in their right mind at all times. But it more evident in the man who sets things in motion, Bruno Anthony. Bruno is played with great precision by Robert Walker as a man almost completely unstable, but yet with a great mind about him which makes him highly dangerous as he can mask his insanity very well. Point of most Hitchcock films is what murder is perfect. Everyone gets their just desserts this film has a thrilling way of getting to its conclusion. The triumph of this film, which sets it apart from other fun or intriguing Hitchcock films for me is the everyman aspect of having these near no names star in this film aptly named Strangers on a Train. There is also the fascinating cinematography job done by Robert Burkes, that catches chilling angles of murder and other scenes, which heighten the tension of the film perfectly. It's the logicalness of it all that is intrigues me the most though as Bruno's reasoning seems so sound, quite a twisted character in a Hitchcock masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Hyde Within</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>On the surface there was little in Robert Walker's film roles to suggest a demented killer.The actor normally portrayed innocent boy-next-door types, or light-hearted comedic characters throughout his career.Every now and then, though, one glimpsed a quite serious look that, if exploited, might make for a nifty double-faced villain. Leave it to Alfred Hitchcock to perceive this potential (just as he'd done earlier with Joseph Cotton in "Shadow of a Doubt").So when it came to casting Bruno Anthony in "Strangers on a Train," Hitch shrewdly pegged Walker for the part. In Robert, Hitchcock apparently saw just the right degree of love/hate power/vulnerability to make Bruno fascinating.As a result, Walker turns in one of his most memorable performances. This, even with the suspicion that something serious within the actor's own makeup was being dangerously aroused. And judging from the circumstances surrounding his untimely death, such suspicions do not seem unfounded.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Questionable premise (and ending)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The premise itself is not what's questionable, but how Bruno Anthony handles it. The idea was that he and Guy to commit each other's murders. There would be no link and each would have alibis. However, Bruno creates a link by frequently pestering Guy and crashing the parties that Guy attends; there are several potential eye witnesses. At this point, if Guy does indeed intend to kill Bruno's father, how is it possible that either would get away with it? Bruno would have an alibi, but he would be linked to Guy and police would start inquiring into how/why the two knew each other; it would look awfully suspicious and, no matter how outrageous the idea, that they would enter into a contract to mutually kill each other's nemseses, the police would look into it.As for the ending, it isn't necessarily the idea that a cop would recklessy fire in the direction of a merry-go-round and killing the operator that undermines credibility, but that's he's not reprimanded for it. I guess this part is left to the audience?Despite these questions and flaws, the film is still very entertaining and manages to lay on the tension nicely. Robert Walker is excellent as Bruno Anthony.One last note: this film is given hilarious tribute in Throw Momma from the Train.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Walker's Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When it comes to Cinema's hall of fame of screen villains Robert Walker's Bruno Anthony has to rank up there with the best of them. Outwardly harmless, he possesses the twisted psyche of a spoiled mummy's boy who is all too willing to resort to murder to get his own way (sounds a little like Norman Bates, doesn't it?).Walker graces the role with sly hints of effeminacy that hint at his character's sexual orientation, something that in 1951 would have contributed to the overall impression of louche decadence. And what a loathsome creature he truly is, almost toadying towards tennis player Guy Haines as he ingratiates his way into the hapless athlete's life only to turn it upside down with his diabolical 'criss-cross' plan. To be fair, Haines is a tailor-made victim, and the passive indecision of his character is perhaps the film's biggest flaw. As others have no doubt noted, Haines would only need have gone to the police to sort everything out because Bruno's suave mask is clearly as fragile as an eggshell, and even a novice interrogator would quickly determine that something's not right about him.As murder plots go, it's not a bad idea ? apart from the unlikelihood of two like-minded strangers meeting, discussing and then agreeing to such a plot in the first place. Bruno takes the vaguest of affirmations ? distractedly delivered by Haines to shake him off ? as confirmation that his plan is a goer and promptly murders Haine's estranged wife in a justifiably famous fairground murder scene.The psychological subtext is laid on pretty thick for an early fifties film, making it a piece of work that rewards repeated viewings. Walker's character grows increasingly menacing as the film progresses, not through any changes of attitude or manner on his part, but because of what the audience learns about him as the story unfolds. For the most part, however, his role in the film is simply as a villainous foil for the clear-cut Haines, which is a shame as it would have been interesting to see just how Bruno became as twisted as he was. Nevertheless, Strangers on a Train deserves the classic status it enjoys, and is worth a couple of hours of anybody's time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Ingenious Premise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In this revered Hitchcock classic, two men meet accidentally on a train; neither knows the other. Guy Haines (Farley Granger) and Bruno Anthony (Robert Walker) chitchat about people in their lives who are bothersome. The treacherous Bruno then proposes a scheme whereby the two men swap murders. Each fellow does the other fellow's murder. Alibis would be assured; and if either were caught, the police would not have a case because of the lack of motive. It's an ingenious story premise.As the obvious villain, Bruno is smart but psychopathic; he is jobless, and lives with his wealthy mom and dad. Guy is likable, good-looking, smart, and an ace tennis player. The two men make an odd pair.Although the premise is clever, the film's plot is disappointing. It starts out okay. But the action quickly becomes ludicrous. Guy's cigarette lighter is used as a major plot point, one that reeks of story contrivance. The tennis match in the second half goes on for ten painful minutes; it stops the film's plot, dead in its track. I don't know what Hitchcock was thinking to have such an extraneous event consume so much screen time. The film ends rather messily in a sequence that is both ridiculous and laughable.On the other hand, the film's high-contrast B&amp;W lighting is wonderfully noir; and the visual frames are composed with exquisite care. Performances overall are good, but Patricia Hitchcock is really, really good. And I liked Marion Lorne, as Bruno's eccentric mother, dithering in her ways with that little laugh of hers. The film's original score was annoying; but I liked the song "The Band Played On".Despite an implausible plot that gradually descends into silliness, "Strangers On A Train" is worth at least a one-time viewing, mostly because it's such a well-known classic, but also for the fine performances and that great B&amp;W cinematography.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Definitely one of Hitchcocks best!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've never read the original book so on that point i can't really comment but what I can say is that this film is surely in Hitchcocks top 5 of his best. Some may not agree with me shouting "Vertigo!" or "Rear window!" as Hitchcocks best but if you did and think about the film, you mind might change.First, i'll comment on the performances. Farley Granger and Robert Walker both stun as the two lead parts, the latter really showing off his talent by presenting Bruno Anthony's dark maniac-esquire persona.He was so good in the shots where all he did was stand still, watching, gave me the creeps!! Next, i'll briefly mention the music. Like all Hitchcock films, the music is a huge part (apart from rear window) and this film is now different. I find it just incredible that in this film, the music can make the viewer go through so many emotions. it manages to make anything seem scary-even a picture. It's just magnificent.Overall, Strangers on a train is a masterpiece in every field. In my view, it shows up modern thriller/crime/drama/romantic films with its tense edgy feel and kept me and i'm sure it will keep many other people on the edge of their seats and the film reaches its climactic final quarter of an hour. Highly, highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This deserves respect for what it was -- clearly it demonstrated it was well above par for its day and age in cinematic terms. It still engages today.The central feature is not the plot, which is preposterous. What matters is how the camera tells its story. Note how we see this through reflections in eyeglasses. Note the 'Citizen Kane' studying-the-ceiling camera position. The camera's placement and movement denotes that it acts, rather than observes.And...the construction that involves layers of watchers. We (the movie audience) watching an audience watching a tennis match - another 'reflection'. Or the reflected 'race against the clock' jump cuts between Granger on the one hand and Walker with his retrieval of the lighter on the other, both surrounded by 'watchers'. And the titillatingly clever finale on the Merry Go Round which nicely heightens the tension in us by forcing a separation between the antagonists and their 'watchers'</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Criss Cross Murder, Striking Visual Moments &amp; Doubles Galore</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In Alfred Hitchcock's adaptation of Patricia Highsmith's "Strangers On A Train", Guy Haines (Farley Granger)and Bruno Anthony (Robert Walker)meet for the first time on a train journey and discuss the idea of carrying out two murders. The rather pushy Anthony suggests that he could murder Haines' unfaithful wife and Haines could murder Anthony's domineering father. The lack of any connection between the murderer and the victim in each case should ensure that both crimes would remain unsolved. The tenor of the conversation leaves the more easy going Haines with the impression that the proposal is not entirely serious. Complications arise later when Anthony murders Haines' wife in an amusement park and then pursues Haines to keep his side of the bargain.The differences between the two men are clear from the start. Haines is a professional tennis player, respectable and rather modest about his achievements whereas Anthony's life is going nowhere and he admits to having been thrown out of three colleges for drinking and gambling. Haines is in a relationship with a Senator's daughter who he wants to marry. Anthony characteristically interprets this as a cynical manoeuvre on Haines' part to provide himself with a shortcut to a career. The character differences are also reinforced visually. Anthony often inhabits shadowed areas and travels in a boat called "Pluto" whereas Haines is frequently seen from the more heroic perspective provided by low camera angles.There are some striking visual sequences such as:- (1) The murder of Haines' wife which is shown through the reflection of her glasses which fall to the ground as she struggles to free herself from Anthony.(2) The depiction of Anthony alone, dressed in black and looking very small against the enormous white Jefferson Memorial building.(3) The occasion where all the spectators at a tennis match are moving their heads in unison, following the action, whilst one head (Anthony's) chillingly remains fixed in a position looking at Haines.(4)The scene where the roundabout goes wildly out of control and eventually crashes spectacularly.Frequent use is made of "doubles" throughout the story, for example, Haines and Anthony are originally introduced as 2 pairs of feet getting out of their taxis and going to the train. As the train pulls out of the station, there are 2 sets of tracks each providing a choice of 2 ways forward. The 2 men discuss the murders of 2 potential victims and order 2 double whiskies. The Hitchcock cameo sees him struggling on board the train carrying a double bass. Haines feels double crossed when his wife reneges on an agreement they had for her to see a lawyer to arrange a divorce. Haines' wife goes to the amusement park with 2 boyfriends. When Anthony confronts her before the murder he lights his cigarette lighter and produces 2 reflections in her glasses. Anthony later becomes very disconcerted when he meets the Senator's younger daughter who he sees as a double for Haines' wife. Anthony also feels double crossed when Haines refuses to go ahead with the second murder. When Haines is travelling alone in a train going to Metcalf, he sees 2 men in the same carriage accidentally kicking their feet together in the same way that he and Anthony had.The action throughout the movie proceeds at a great pace and the performances of Robert Walker and Patricia Hitchcock (as the Senator's younger daughter) are particularly powerful.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You scratch my itch, I'll scratch yours.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hitchcock had a few clunkers along the way (and even those usually appeal to someone as Hitch put so much of himself into his work), but this one certainly belongs towards the top ranking of his films for its sheer cohesive design and compelling storyline. Granger stars as a hot tennis pro, in love with socialite Roman, but married to cheating harridan Rogers. One day his toe hits that of Walker's and it kicks off a conversation that winds up with Walker suggesting that he bump off Rogers in exchange for Granger killing Walker's oppressive father! Granger laughs it off and politely excuses himself until a short time later when his shrew of a wife is found strangled to death. Walker then begins to wonder when Granger is going to hold up his end of the "bargain" and is not very pleased when he seems to resist the idea. Meanwhile, Roman, thanks to some of Granger's comments, isn't altogether sure her lover is innocent and her little sister Hitchcock (the director's daughter) keeps mouthing in jest reasons why he's a prime suspect! The pressure between the men builds until they face each other down in a vivid, whirling climax. Granger is appealing enough in his part, though he can't help but be overshadowed by Walker's showier role. He's likable, especially after seeing what he's up against in Rogers, yet can't help coming off as a bit of a sap. Roman is a monument of artifice and overacting, though occasionally some true emotion breaks through. Her already deep voice and heavy makeup and severe hairstyling serve to separate her from the romantic and delicate feelings she ought to be conveying. It's almost amusing to watch her eyes dart everywhere in mechanical fretfulness. Walker is a revelation. Having been cast many times as kindly young men, his leering, reckless, dangerous, sophisticated and unhinged, spoiled brat character is a big stretch for him and one he nails completely. (His son would later play a similarly indulged and homicidal role, Charlie X, on a classic episode of "Star Trek".) Rogers is a startling piece of work herself, unabashedly flaunting two boyfriends and looking for a third and nastily informing Granger that she's going to stay with him whether he likes it or not. Speech-impeded Hitchcock zealously overacts her character, too, flouncing around in a chiffon coverlet and spouting witticisms, but provides a level of amusement with it. She also gets to display some range when her spirited character begins to become frightened. Rounding out the cast are Hitchcock fave Carroll as Roman's father, befuddled delight Lorne as Walker's in-denial mother and Varden as a ritzy matron who lets Walker go a bit to far with a murderous demonstration. It's a film in which no detail was left to chance. One that film students can spend (and have spent) hours poring over for its symbolism and subtext. Walker, who could not have overtly portrayed a homosexual in 1951, finds ways though eye contact and body language to get his intentions across. Note how, as he's beginning to clamp down on Granger, his tie has lobsters on it or the way he sticks his feet out as far as he can, knowing that they'll be in the way when Granger sits down and attempts to cross his own. When he and Granger fight on the carousel, they lie prone on the floor as shafts from the horses pump up and down, in and out. Style abounds in every frame and creativity is used throughout making this a film that can be enjoyed many times over and examined for underlying visual symbols. The finale is a knockout even today. The American release print has a few minor cuts that soften Walker's flamboyance, but adds a corny tag at the end to ensure a happy ending. Ironically, both Rogers and Lorne would land recurring roles on the TV series "Bewitched".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Always Be Wary Of Strangers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of Alfred Hitchcock's best films, and one of his most underrated. I believe it certainly exceeds a 'Psycho' or 'The Birds' for technical artistry and brilliance. It is a macabre, tense, darkly humorous product that will leave you in awe for quite some time.Robert Walker creates one of Hitchcock's most memorable villains as the father-hating, mother-fixated (but aren't most of Hitchcock's villains mummy's boys?) Bruno. It is a disturbing, stunning performance that illuminates the whole film. His character is obsessive, apparently homosexual (look at those deliberately effeminate ties and hear how he is described as 'European'), strangely charming and dangerous to cross. Farley Granger certainly knows this as he becomes entangled in Bruno's sordid web after the pair meet on a train. Bruno, knowing some inside information on Guy's affairs, proposes the two 'swap' murders for each other's benefit. Walker will kill Granger's slutty, conniving wife who is inhibiting his marriage to beautiful Anne, whilst Granger will murder Bruno's father, who he so intensely hates. Everyone's happy, right? A win-win, as Bruno asserts? Wrong. Granger forgets about the indecent proposal, but an obsessed Walker doesn't. He commits his murder and is determined to hound Granger until he completes his side of the bargain too. 'Strangers' becomes a riveting, suspenseful game of cat-and-mouse in Hitch's capable hands.Hitchcock was absolutely amazing at creating intriguing minor characters and building scenes. We have the whore Miriam, Granger's estranged wife pregnant to another man. She lasciviously slurps a phallic ice-cream cone whilst openly eating up Bruno with her eyes. Barbara Morton, Anne's sister, is a deceptively sweet yet smart and cunning young girl who comes out with the most crude remarks you'll hear from a bespectacled girl in the pictures in the 50's. Senator Morton is authoritative and self-absorbed. This is one of the most daring films Hitchcock ever made, and it is, typical to a Hitch film, subtly sexual in detail.This fits into the film-noir category with it's focus on murder, lies and deceit and shadowy cinematography. Walker's nut is one for the ages, and Granger makes a convincing troubled protagonist. Roman is perhaps weaker than the other two, and I never believed her relationship with Granger. Still, the overwhelming positives cancel out the slight negatives and it can be safely said that this is one of the BEST American films ever made.Just look at what Hitch does here- the originality, the technical skill. We see the murder of Miriam reflected in her shattered glasses. A game of tennis turns into one of the most thrilling, intense scenes you'll ever see. A innocent fairground turns into a place of murder and foul occurrences. A young boy's balloon is popped callously by Walker (Hitch obviously liked what he saw in 'The Third Man!').Children's delight at riding the carousel turns into screaming, fast-paced terror. Hitch subverts normal, everyday events like no other.The camera-work here is among the best ever seen in a Hitchcock film, and the premise is to-die-for. It's slick, oozes sophistication and devilish charm. The cross-cutting between Walker and Granger's characters is magnificent- Granger's do-or-die tennis match is just as vital as villain Walker's rescue of an incriminating piece of evidence lost down a drain. Hitch again build his villain into a nasty, repulsive yet sympathetic and oddly charming (Did anyone else find him strangely attractive, more so than Granger?) piece of work- we are just as tense as Walker in our hope that he can get the lighter out of the drain. We need him to, anyway. He holds the key to the story.You'll never view an approach from a stranger in the same way again after seeing this film.Amazing.10/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, this is about as good as they come. There are arguments about whether Hitchcock was only a "master of commercial suspense" or maybe a "compulsive technician" -- or was he really "deep." Nobody knows precisely what terms like that mean, but it's legitimate to ask if, at his best, he could not have been all three things at once. In this one he seems to be about at his peak. Hardly anything in it is accidental. It abounds with doubt, ambiguity, and wit. And the story is engrossing, Patricia Highsmith apparently having complexes similar to Hitchcock's own. I'm sure the plot has been thoroughly outlined elsewhere so I won't bother going into it. I'll just point out five on screen incidents that Hitchcock is undoubtedly responsible for. Bruno Antony (Walker) has followed Miriam (Laura Miller) and her two boyfriends to a carnival at night with the intent of murdering her. She's noticed his attention and is innocently flattered by it. 1. Laura and her two friends rent an electric boat to go through The Tunnel of Love and then to an island in the center of the lake. Walker is right behind them, smiling, in his boat -- Pluto. "Pluto." It's not an allusion to the Walt Disney cartoon character. It's a reference to Pluto, also called Hades, a god of the underworld in Greek and Roman mythology. This tiny touch can't be an accident. And the "underworld" that Walker represents is not just a literal hell, but the underworld of the human mind. I hate to say he's a Jungian "shadow" but that's what he is. (Did Carl Jung see this movie? He was alive at the time of its release -- but probably not.) 2. Now, this is a deadly serious sequence, right? Walker is a lunatic who is about to murder a woman he doesn't even know. Imagine the way this would have been laid out by most directors. A night-time stalking through a crowded carnival, stealing from shadow to shadow, the killer peering from behind the canvas walls, and so forth. What does Hitchcock show us? When Walker first comes through the gates, concentrating on his victim, a little boy in a cowboy suit, holding a balloon, runs up and shouts, "Bang! Bang! You're dead!" Walker jerks his head back in surprise and glares down indignantly at the kid. And when the kid starts to walk away, Walker darts his cigarette at the balloon and pops it, then continues his pursuit without another glance. That's one way Hitchcock treats impending doom. 3. The famous strangling reflected in the fallen eyeglasses, which has been aped innumerable times. 4. Miriam and her friends stop at one of those devices that you pound with a big mallet, sending a kind of hockey puck up the shaft to measure the strength of your blow. One of her boyfriend whams it and the puck doesn't reach the bell at the top. Under Miriam's delighted and admiring gaze, Walker smiles and rubs his hands together, then picks up the mallet, slams it down, and the puck bangs against the bell. She's thrilled. He puts the mallet down, looks at her, grins, and WAGGLES HIS EYEBROWS at her like a ten-year-old showoff! 5. After the discovery of Miriam's body, while whistles blow and people shout, Walker leaves the carnival and encounters a blind man waiting at the curb. Walker takes the old fellow by the arm and leads him across the intersection, gravely holding up his hand to stop the traffic. A macabre joke. These incidents and others all take place during the ten or fifteen-minutes of the carnival visit. (Robert Walker's performance is exceptional throughout.) It's essentially a kind of invitation to be noirish. (Cf: "Ride the Pink Horse") But the menace of the scene is undercut by Hitchcock's insistence on irony and distance. None of the familiar noir techniques are employed. There's nothing really "creepy" about it. And the murder itself is hardly a savage one. I don't think that any director other than Hitchcock would have handled it the way he did. It would have been all menace and shadows, hiding places, abortive attempts, scowls instead of grins. Not that it's an entirely flawless movie. A flawless movie is not yet with us. Some of the middle section is a bit slow going and Farley Granger, although a nice guy, is stolid, dull, and rather stupid. His new girl friend is just dull. Hitchcock was to treat the misattribution of guilt with deadly seriousness in "The Wrong Man." I'm not sure Hitchcock ever thought about the difference between legal guilt and moral guilt. The latter was imposed on him at an early age by his Catholic education. "Original sin" -- you're BORN with it -- and all that. In filmed interviews, he always glibly explained away his fear of the police and of authorities generally by telling a story about his father taking him to the police station to put a scare into him after some peccadillo. We're justified in asking if that was only what psychoanalysis calls a "screen memory." I hope you get the pun. I know, I know. It's strained and inept but I spent a good deal of valuable time thinking it up.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of Hitchcock's best "wrongly-accused" movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In Truffaut book-length interview with Hitchcock, it's apparent that Big Al's fear from the police dates back to his childhood. His father sent him to the police station carrying a note. The note said: "He's been naughty, imprison him for an hour." The policemen obliged and ever since Hitchcock has had a deep fear of being wrongly accused and taken by the police."Strangers on a Train" is probably one of the best in his "wrongly-accused" series. The movie is based on a Patricia Highsmith novel. That's the same author who wrote the Ripley series. She was always fascinated by smart criminals.Hitchcock's opening is very strong and takes you immediately to the protagonists: Guy Haines, a famous tennis player, and Bruno Anthony, the aspiring criminal. The two guys share a chemistry which in that day and age was probably a lot more than what the audience could chew. Bruno tries to persuade Guy that they could commit the perfect murder (leaving no clues), if they switch victims. Bruno will kill Guy's wife who wouldn't give him a divorce, and Guy would kill Bruno's father. The motives are respectively love and money.Bruno's performance is meant to be seductive and homoerotic. This is not something that was done by accident. In fact, Hitchcock edited two versions of the movie: one US, one UK. In the US version the volume of Bruno's seductiveness was turned down quite a bit."Strangers on a Train" is a very deep movie but more importantly this is another excellent Hitchcock thriller. An excellent example of a thrilling scene is when Guy is climbing the steps up to Bruno's father room. Hitchcock reasoned that the audience's attention needed to be distracted at this point so that they don't figure out what Guy will find in the room. Hitch treats us to a HUGE, menacing dog at the top of the stairs which provided the needed distraction.The most famous shot in the movie occurs during a tennis match. Bruno has been continuously stalking Guy so that Guy will fulfil his end of the bargain (kill his father). When Guy looks at the audience, all the heads are swiveling back and forth. All except one - Bruno's. He's looking straight at Guy with an "i'll-get-you" smile.The ending is another example of suspense. Both men fight for one key piece of evidence on a merry-go-round that's rotating at mad speed. A worker is crawling under it so he could get to the controls. When we finally get off this ride and the movie ends with Guy proving his innocence, we are left exhausted and nail-less (for those of us still biting our nails!)."Strangers on a Train" is easily one of Hitchcock's best "wrongly accused" movies. Some credit him with one of the best villains (Bruno) as well. All in all, the movie might appear somewhat dated but that's a lesson in thriller-making from the master himself. I won't turn down Leonardo, if he came to teach me Renaissance painting, so neither should you.&lt;&lt; Review posted at FilmDailies.com&gt;&gt;</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Never talk to a stranger</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In Alfred Hitchcock's "Strangers on a train" (1951), Robert Walker gave a remarkable and disturbing performance as Bruno, a spoiled playboy - psychopath who came up with a brilliant idea of committing a perfect murder - find a stranger who hates someone strong enough to wish them dead and swap murders with him - he kills yours, you kill his. While on a train, Bruno introduces himself to a handsome rising tennis star, Guy (Farley Granger) who is going through a rather nasty public divorce with his unfaithful wife Miriam in order to marry the woman he loves, Anne Morton. Guy hates his wife but would he kill Bruno's dominating father if Bruno murders his wife? One of the most discussed and analyzed Hitchcock's films, "Strangers on a train" is considered one of the most satisfying thrillers ever. It is based on the early novel by the master of the psychological crime thrillers, Patricia Highsmith and it is a great artistic achievement in the thriller genre due to the masterful and creating Hitchcock's directing. Many scenes stand out and some are simply carved in the viewer's memory like the head turning tennis match with only one head never turned and the eyes fixed on Guy's's face and these are Bruno's eyes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Robert Walker plays one of the truly frightening characters in cinema. Because I have always seen him play the good guy (e.gs., "One Touch of Venus," "Since You Went Away" -- a Tom Hanks kind of good guy), his Bruno is all the more harrowing. Mr. Walker played a true sociopath long before it became a lexicon in pop psychology. In this film he is charming when that is what is required and brutal when that is what is required, and everything else that is required, all in the service of his own needs. Many later movies claim to contain or hope to portray menacing figures. Nothing I have seen approaches Robert Walker in this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wow</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is not one of the most known films made by the master, but it delivers. Big time. My personal Hitchcock favorite.As the film starts we see a conversation between two men. One a tennis player, other a man who clearly knows much about the first guy. After the talk the other guy invites the tennis player for a dinner. There he revels his true intentions. He wants to do a perfect murder. He would kill whoever is in the other guy's way, while he would kill his father. The criss-cross murder is simply the way to do it if u want to get away with the murder. Of course they never met before so there is no motive. But it gets complicated when Guy, the tennis player, refuses the offer.Hitchcock creates suspense like no one and here he is at his best. There are numerous scenes where his genius is shown. Like the scene where Guy is looking in the crowd searching for Bruno, and all of the heads are moving except Brunos. Then there is the murder scene where a murder is seen in the reflection of the glasses. But the scene that simply impressed me was the final scene. It's simply amazing and it shows a different Alfred.As far as acting is concerned it's really great. The characters are very unique and u can connect to at least one. The most entertaining person was Bruno who keeps on surprising us with his tricks and intelligence.Hitch knows hot to make an unbelievable film from a great script ( see Psycho or North by Northwest )and his directing combined with a great story and acting makes this a great experience. 4/4</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Any major differences between USA and UK versions?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've just recently been given a copy of SoaT that has both the UK and US versions. It's one of my favourite Hitchcock films (I don't know if I've been seeing the UK or USA version....I'm in Canada), and I look forward to watching it again. But time is rather tight right now, and I wonder if anyone out there can tell me: are there significant differences between the two films? Or is it a matter of "if you've seen one, you've pretty much seen both." I would think it wouldn't much matter, but recently I had a look at the film "Prequel to the Exorcist" - the one they had advertised in the theatres. Compared to "Dominion" (which I have and quite enjoy), it was awful (see the "Dominion" page on IMDb for info, they cover it quite well there).Many thanks, Ms. Verdi</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Strangers on a Train: One of Hitchcock's Best Thrillers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alfred Hitchcock is a genius. When I first saw Psycho, I thought that it had to be his best film. After viewing Strangers on a Train, I know that Alfred had many more great films than just Psycho. Starngers on a Train blew me away. When it got tense, it never let up.Tennis star Guy Haines, traveling on a train from Washington to New York, meets Bruno Anthony, a clever but extremely twisted tennis fan. Bruno introduces a number of "theories" to Guy, including one in which Guy would kill Bruno's father, who Bruno hated, and Bruno would kill Guy's wife, who Guy hated. After leaving the train and Bruno, Guy didn't think about the odd plot again. Until his wife is found dead. And then Bruno gives him a call . . .The film is paced perfectly. Hitchcock deftly creates suspense, sometimes suspense enough to make you a little uncomfortable. Even though in the back of my mind, I knew how the movie was going to turn out, I was on the edge of my seat.Hitchcock uses music very well here also. During the tennis match, he cuts from the match to Bruno trying to reach an object, which is crucial to his plans. (For those of you who haven't seen the film, I'm not going to tell you what this "object" was.) The music in these two locations is different, and captures the two moods perfectly.The characters are strong, and this helps the film immensely. Robert Walker, playing the role of Bruno, creates a very believable maniac. Farley Granger does a fine job in is role as Guy, also. Ruth Roman, who is Anne Morton, Guy's girlfriend in the film, is a very beautiful woman, and is also a believable actress.This film does have it's stupid moments, however. For example, at the end, a police officer accidentally shoots a carousel conductor, and no one seems to notice or care. And he was shooting at Guy, when he had no reason whatsoever to actually fire at him. But this moment does not take away from the film as a whole, because the film is so entertaining that you do not care if something a little stupid happens.I recommend this film to anyone who loves thrillers or Alfred Hitchcock films. I also recommend it to any movie lover in general. Strangers on a Train should entertain any film lover.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>what a beautifully morbid film this is</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Strangers on a Train shows Alfred Hitchcock at his most shamelessly entertaining in direction, using a script with some razor-wire wit (Raymond Chandler co-wrote it, and one can tell where his style stops and goes), and some really wonderful character actors who are cast so well to type it's almost ridiculous. It's the kind of story that can only happen in movies, especially of the Hitchcock vein; I imagine the 'master' having his kicks making a movie like this, one that doesn't necessarily mess with the audience's head like Psycho, but has that same tension between the good vs. the evil (the latter of which not always as it might seem, to put it mildly). Two well-to-do men meet on a train, one more eager to talk than the other (this one being Robert Walker as Bruno, the elegant, pushy, scathingly funny antagonist to Farley Granger's Haines), and a 'criss-cross' murder scheme is presented forth. This leads the story into a carnival sequence that ranks among Hitchcock's finest (it's also fast-paced too, in a way, it keeps moving- finger snaps- and then leads up to something we know was going to happen, but like 'this' is the surprise).Then, of course, the even more morbid, creatively odd pieces of storytelling make their way into the fabric. It's not a whodunit, but rather an almost satire of the boredom and terrifying double-edged sword nature of the high-life. Bruno may be a truly wicked soul, but he's not totally un-likable; there is something about the Hitchcock villains, like in most of the great stories out there, that make them even more interesting than the protagonist. Not that Granger's performance is bad; he actually has a good handle on the sort of petrified look throughout the film. But it's Walker, and supporting players like Kasey Rogers as Miriam Haines, and surprisingly (maybe not too surprisingly) Hitchcock's daughter Patricia as the young sister with a 'similar' pair of glasses, who pull out the best acting.There are maybe a couple of minor liabilities, if not necessarily in my book then for others; a couple of scenes are so shameless to entertain that the art-value of the film *almost* becomes a little too incredible for its own good. That it's also not scored by the great Bernard Herrmann is also a downer. But other than that, the film is totally unpredictable, and therefore not only gives opportunities for some jaw-drops with its story turns, but also provides some very funny parts, once the tone is set. I sense a little in relation to a Bunuel film at times (Hitchcock did mention Bunuel as one of his favorites), like when Bruno 'crashes' a black-tie party of Haines', and gives two little old ladies an experiment in his ideals. This all leads up to another carnival sequence. I won't say too much of it, aside from it bringing some genuine thrills, but what shocked me was really how it culminated, that when things came to a head, it wasn't at the expense of the total disbelief of the situation. And that song can stick with you for days. This is one of Hitchcok's most entertaining films, still with some of that classy style from his films of the 40's, but also as a kind of bridge to the more outrageous films of his later years.</fullReview>

The writer of "Incredible Mr. Ripley" contributed to this screenplay; The story is presented realistically and with considerable psychological insight.If it is a rainy, dark night, rent or buy this film: It is perfectly written and directed.

		<fullReview>It all begins when tennis star Guy Haines (Farley Granger) and Bruno Anthony (Robert Walker) meet on a train. Bruno suggests that they perform tit-for-tat murders, but Guy thinks that it's a joke. Unfortunately, it turns out not to be. And after Bruno carries out his part of the "deal", he expects Guy to do likewise."Strangers on a Train" makes interesting use of camera angle. The opening scene shows cars arriving from opposite sides of the screen, and then the two men get out of the cars and start walking in different directions, implying that they're not the same sort of people. After Bruno murders Guy's wife, he calls to Guy from behind a gate casting a shadow on him; it looks as if he's in jail. When Guy walks over to where Bruno is, it is as if he has entered the same realm as the murderer. As for the possibility of whether or not Bruno was gay, that is a possibility; I read something about the "murderous gays" in Alfred Hitchcock's movies (they may or may not have been gay). But the point is, Hitchcock created another addition to his pantheon of masterpieces.Oh, and I guess that this isn't really related, but does it sway our opinion of the movie knowing Marion Lorne (aka "Bewitched"'s Aunt Clara) played Bruno's mother?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Totally excellent villain!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A coworker recommended this movie, so I rented the DVD. I'm giving this movie an 8 out of 10 strictly for Robert Walker's TOTALLY EXCELLENT portrayal as the killer. He had that creepy, momma's-boy, psychopath part down to a tee!!! He was totally great to watch. I loved the scenes with his mother (Marion Lorne, who played Aunt Clara, my favorite witch on Bewitched when I was a kid!). She was just totally charmed by her bad-boy son. The scene of them together with her giving him a manicure and noticing in his eyes that he's up to no good again (he's getting ready to murder Farley Granger's wife), and then him charming her out of her worries and then them both laughing about his (abandoned) plans to blow up the White House. "Oh, I gave that idea up," he reassures his mother, "Besides, what would the president say?" he oozes as his mother chuckles. Oh the sick, dark, black humor of Alfred Hitchcock is so delicious!Another funny moment: At the fair, a little boy carrying a balloon walks up to Robert Walker, who's smoking a cigarette, and points a toy gun at him. "Bang bang you're dead" the little brat says. Robert Walker just glares at him then oh-so-casually pops the boy's balloon with his cigarette. I almost tossed my cookies I was laughing so hard!The lady who played Miriam (Farley Granger's wife, the murder victim) was great, as was the younger sister of Farley Granger's girlfriend (played by Hitch's daughter, Patricia; she played the sister, not the girlfriend). Both of these actresses were terrific in their parts and I loved every moment of their screen time.Not so terrific were Farley Granger and Ruth Roman as his girlfriend. They just killed the movie each time they were on screen together. Still, I'd recommend this movie HIGHLY for its interesting storyline and the excellent villain-ness (is there such a word?) of Robert Walker.Oh, and the ending on the merry-go-round. I've read a lot of complaints about it here on IMDb, but that was another scene where I was laughing my behind off. It was just sooooo over the top. I hope Hitch meant for it to be darkly funny. I'd hate to think I was laughing AT him. I hope I was laughing WITH him. Hitch's movies are at their best when they combine disturbing psychoticness with dark humor. Both are in this movie for sure!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hitchcock Close to His Best (Possible Spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Possible spoilers The title of this film reflects the fact that its plot is set in motion by a chance meeting on a train between two young men, Guy Haines, a leading amateur tennis player, and Bruno Anthony, the son of a wealthy family. Bruno recognises Guy and strikes up a conversation with him. Both men have had difficulties in their private lives. Bruno knows from the gossip columns that Guy is estranged from his unfaithful wife Miriam and is hoping for a divorce to enable him to marry his new girlfriend Anne, the daughter of an influential senator. Bruno himself hates his domineering father who is keeping him short of money. Bruno therefore makes a shocking proposal to Guy. Each of them has motive for murdering a person they hate. They should therefore 'swap murders', so that Bruno kills Guy's wife and Guy kills Bruno's father. The advantage of this is that there would be no motive to connect them to the crimes they actually committed, and each would have an alibi to clear them of the crimes they might be suspected of committing.Guy does not take Bruno seriously, and laughs off his proposal. Bruno, however, who is mentally disturbed, meant what he said in all seriousness, and convinces himself that Guy has agreed to his scheme. He tracks Miriam down, follows her to a funfair and strangles her. Guy, who cannot establish an alibi, becomes the obvious suspect, and the police place him under observation. To make matters worse, Bruno reappears and insists that Guy should keep his side of the 'bargain' by killing his father.The film has (in addition to a number of minor ones) one major plot hole. It is never convincingly explained why Guy does not tell the police about his meeting with Bruno or about Bruno's subsequent admission to Miriam's murder. If, however, one can overlook this point, 'Strangers on a Train' is highly effective both as a thriller and as a character study. Alfred Hitchcock was fascinated by psychology, especially the psychology of evil. Like Norman Bates in 'Psycho', Bruno is a psychological case-study. Spoilt by his doting mother and ignored by his authoritarian father, he has grown up an obsessive loner. He has been obsessed with Guy long before their fateful meeting, and knows all the details not only of his sporting career, but also of his private life. The 'celebrity stalker' is clearly not an exclusively modern phenomenon. Robert Walker's portrayal is a brilliant one, making Bruno both flamboyant and creepy. (This was Walker's last film before his early death). There are hints, which in the moral climate of the early fifties could not be fully developed, that the camp, insinuating Bruno may have homosexual tendencies and that his interest in Guy may derive from sexual motives.The theme of a man wrongly suspected or accused of a crime is a frequent one in Hitchcock's work, from 'The Thirty-Nine Steps' to 'Frenzy'. It is interesting that the hero of this film has a Christian name that is a slang term for 'man'; the idea was possibly to make him an Everyman figure. Farley Granger's Guy is less flamboyant than Walker's Bruno, but no less critical to the success of the film. On the surface he is a handsome, successful and confident athlete, but there are suggestions that underneath he is weak and indecisive. His indecision may stem from feelings of guilt about the failure of his marriage and about Miriam's death- shortly before she died they had a very public quarrel in which he shouted that he could strangle her.The relationship between the two men is very much at the centre of the film- unlike many of Hitchcock's works there is no trademark blonde heroine. (In films dominated by the male characters, Hitchcock often preferred to cast a brunette in the main female role, as here with Ruth Roman). Nevertheless, there are some good performances in minor roles. The best of these is from Laura Elliott as Miriam. In some ways she is a despicable and spiteful character, but in others she is a pitiable one, a rather plain woman who is unable to cope with marriage to a good-looking and successful celebrity and whose promiscuous behaviour results from a need to prove to herself that she can be attractive to other men. As often with Hitchcock, there is comic relief even in the context of a serious film, here provided by the drunken college professor who fails to provide Guy with an alibi and by Marion Lorne as Bruno's dotty mother. Anne's sister Barbara (played by Hitchcock's daughter Patricia) starts off as a comic character (the obnoxiously knowing youngster), but later plays an important and serious part in the film. There are also a number of individual scenes which show the director's touch- the murder itself (seen reflected in Miriam's glasses which have fallen to the ground), the scene where Bruno pretends to strangle an old lady, the scene at the tennis match where all the faces follow the play except Bruno's whose gaze remains fixed on Guy and the scenes set at the funfair, where innocent amusements such as a merry-go-round and a tunnel of love take on sinister aspects. Despite weaknesses in its plot, 'Strangers on a Train' is a good example of Hitchcock working at, or close to, his best. 8/10PS. Despite the coincidence of surnames, I am no relation to the director.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The tension and suspense in "Strangers on a Train" do not let up until the end. The screenplay and dialogue are top notch. The cast is not starstudded but it is effective. Robert Walker as the twisted and disturbed Bruno Anthony is especially memorable. Farley Granger is very good as Guy Haines but he is completely overshadowed by Walker. I don't think this is any fault of Granger's. The situation is much like that in Cape Fear when Robert Mitchum as the villain overshadowed Gregory Peck. The two most memorable images for me were Bruno staring straight ahead while the rest of the crowd followed the tennis match and of course the murder as seen in the reflection of the glass frames in the spectacles. Yet another winner from The Master, 9/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am embarrassed to say that while I consider myself a student of film, and a Hitchcock fanatic, that my recent viewing of Strangers on a Train was my first. I know, there's no excuse, what with Blockbuster and Hollywood Video on every corner of every street of every city, but unfortunately every time this film came on TCM or AMC (before it become crummy and commercial-laden) I was not able to see it.**Possible Spoiler**How glad am I that I finally did? *This much*. Not only was it brilliantly acted (by one of my favorite Hitchcock leading men, Farley Granger, among others) but it was so well written and directed that even this cynical viewer was held in suspense. The plot has been outlined in numerous other reviews so there is no need for me to rehash, but I do have to bring up the amazing climactic final sequence surrounding the Merry-Go-Round at the Fair. Not only was it exciting and suspenseful to watch the apparatus spin swiftly out of control with our protagonist and antagonist fighting on it (and various other riders hanging on for their lives who were in the wrong place at the wrong time) but watching the old man climb under the speeding ride to try to stop it (a stunt that was really done without trick photography) was beyond gripping. When the ride is finally stopped, it screeches to such a spectacular halt that although I was watching by myself in my living room, I had to say, `WOW!' out loud. While the story is a classic blackmail suspense tale gone wrong, (Obviously the Coen Brothers took notice) Strangers on a Train is refreshing because of its sheer brilliance. A must see for everyone.--Shelly</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Nevermind the wags who point out that Farley Granger's performance is strangely uneven. Ignore that all Granger needed to do to prevent murder was to throw his tennis match rather than desperately trying to win it fast. Whatever faults exist, there are so many virtues drowning them out that this is arguably among the top five Hitchcock movies of all time, which means it must be a timeless classic. In fact, it is. Brimming with stylish jolts, dizzyingly inventive cinematography and an unforgettably psychotic performance by Robert Walker, STRANGERS ON A TRAIN is also highly suspenseful, humorous in just the right spots and generally wicked good fun throughout. While Hitch flicks are always interesting and almost always clever, not all of his output is entertaining and some of it has dated. Despite the concept having been recycled by lesser entries like THROW MOMMA FROM THE TRAIN, this particular piece of celluloid is remarkably fresh and innovative. Clearly the master of suspense was beginning to reach the peak of his creative powers, with all-time greats REAR WINDOW, VERTIGO, NORTH BY NORTHWEST and PSYCHO coming in short order thereafter. If you've never seen this and you're a fan of Hitchcock or suspensers in general, I envy you the cinematic experience you're about to partake in. 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can say quite assuringly, that I've never seen such a highly rated film get such consistently poor reviews on this site. Perhaps its because Strangers doesn't have a huge "praise me unconditionally" name like Vertigo, Rear Window or NBNW. Keep in mind that film (or more accurately Hitchcock) hadn't evolved to that point yet. For everyone who trashed this film in the reviews here, still likely gave the film an 8 or 9. However, those same people I doubt would dare to attack the semi-cheesy ending on Mount Rushmore in NBNW or the very dated dream sequence in Vertigo. I'm sorry the merry-go-round scene struck you as being so poor. Just to let you know, I gave all 4 films mentioned in this review 10's because they were all highly entertaining and very engaging on similar levels with NBNW being my favorite.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How to make a murder.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Strangers On A Train is one of Alfred Hitchcock's more complex and thorough films. It is a simple but effectively presented story of two strangers who meet on a train ride and end up in a twisted plot of murder and blackmail because of a supposed miscommunication. The film embodies many traditional characteristics of Hitchcock's films, such as the wrong man theme, the steady rise of tension, and even the unenviable portrayal of the police. The inner workings of the criminal justice system as well as the wrong man theme work together in Strangers On A Train to create tension and drive much of the plot, as Guy Haines is forced to prove his innocence on his own because the police have wrongly marked him as the perpetrator of his wife's murder.The characterization in Strangers On A Train is one of the most thorough and interesting parts of the film, particularly in the character of Bruno. When we first meet him, he is simply a passenger on a train who, being a tennis fan, is interested in meeting Guy Haines, who he recognizes as a tennis player. Before long, the conversation turns to Bruno's thoughts about the perfect murder, which casts subtle but effective doubt on his personality, because we still don't know if he is serious about murder or if he is just trying to make conversation. His intentions are gradually revealed as he presses the subject even though Guy shows no serious interest at all, and those intentions are even more subtly but effectively illustrated later in the film.(spoilers) In the scene where Guy calls Anne Morton after an unsuccessful attempt to get his wife to sign divorce documents, Hitchcock uses dialogue, situational irony, sound, and especially editing to foreshadow the murder at the same time as he hints who will perform the murder and even how the murder will be committed. In this scene, Guy is telling Anne that he is so angry with Miriam that he could `just strangle her,' but just as he says this, a train rumbles by and he has to repeat himself. The first thing that this sequence does is re-establish the connection between Guy and Bruno, who met on a train at the beginning of the film. Second, Guy's angry words clearly indicate the kind of frustration that she causes him, providing an example of the type of temper tantrum that inspires all people to `want to kill someone at some point in their lives,' as Bruno later points out to the nice old lady that he almost strangles to death. Third, and probably most important, this scene foreshadows the murder. Not only does Guy unknowingly express a desire to kill his wife in exactly the same way that Bruno soon does, but the scene closes with a dissolve from a frustrated Guy standing in the phone booth talking about strangling his wife to a close up of Bruno's hands, held in a position where they appear to be clenched around an imaginary throat. By this point in the film we know that Bruno is a questionable character at best, and his skewed mentality is illustrated in unusual ways later in the film, many of them during the scene where he is explaining to the elderly women at the party how to commit a perfect murder. During this scene, it is the bizarre and almost disturbing use of sound that is most effective in presenting Bruno's mental state. As he is demonstrating the effectiveness of strangulation on one of the women, he goes into a trance while staring at Barbara (who clearly resembles Miriam and, interestingly enough, is played by Hitchcock's daughter), but it is the fact that circus music is playing during all of this that is the most important. Because it is so out of place at this party, the circus music seems to be playing inside Bruno's head, illustrating his mental instability while also serving to represent the carousel wheel at the circus, which symbolizes the structure of the film's plot. The entire plot of Strangers On A Train is a sort of wheel, or a series of wheels. First of all, it begins with Guy Haines meeting a stranger on a train, and it ends with Guy Haines meeting a different stranger on a train, who he avoids, having recently developed an entirely new outlook about strangers on trains. Also, and more importantly, it involves a circular pursuit. The police are investigating Guy for Miriam's murder, Guy is after Bruno in an effort to get his lighter back and prove his innocence, and Bruno is attempting to plant Guy's lighter at the scene of the murder, thereby leading the police to him and framing him for the crime. The carnival, particularly the carousel, seems to be a way to call attention to the fact that these people are chasing each other around in circles, which is best demonstrated in the high paced finale on the carousel at the end of the film. In what is probably the single most obvious portrayal of incompetent police in this film, an officer literally takes a potshot as Guy and Bruno rush onto the crowded carousel, and the conductor is killed, sending the carousel spinning out of control. The way that the carousel moves at such a high rate of speed and is destroyed at the end represents the frantic speed and destructive power of the wheel-like structure of the murder plot communicated in the story. Hitchcock makes extensive use of cinematic elements like sound and dramatic and situational irony to create suspense and to drive and add depth to the plot of Strangers On A Train, which is one of his more complex films. He uses these things in ways that have a direct impact on the plot and the story and serve to deliver the meaning and increase the substance of the film. Hitchcock uses his intricate knowledge of cinematic elements, as well as excellent acting and skillful direction on his own part, to mold Strangers On A Train into a very intense and enjoyable thriller.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film ranks right up there with North by Northwest, Rear Window, Vertigo, and Psycho as one of Hitchcock's best. Farley Granger is much better in this movie than Rope and Ruth Roman, Pat Hitchcock, Leo G. Carroll, and Kasey Rogers (as Laura Elliott) are outstanding as well. However, it is Robert Walker as the sadistic, pushy Bruno Antony. He gives a performance that is unforgettable. He really made the movie in my opinion. Sadly, he died shortly after the film due to cancer. It is interesting to point out that both Rogers and Marion Lorne would play recurring characters on one of my favorite TV shows, Bewitched, as Louise Tate(the 2nd one) and Aunt Clara. Because she had to wear such thick glasses and she was using a different name, it was a long time before I realized that fact. This is a movie that has to be viewed immediately.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is an absolute masterpiece. In my opinion maybe even his best. The directing is perfect. Even compared to other movies of Hitch this one stands out directingwise. This movie puts the S in suspense and the D in directing. I also liked the actors. The movie is perfectly casted and the fact that it is in black and white really adds to the mystery. Black and white works perfectly for this movie. Surprisingly I never hear this movie mentioned when people name their favorite Hitchcock. Alongside movies like Psycho, North By Northwest and Notorious this one is a Hitchcock-highlight. Just see it!!!</fullReview>

It moves quickly on the masterfully direction and the wonderful acting. It's devilishly fun to watch Farley Granger squirm as he tries to figure out how to prove he didn't kill his ex-wife. Robert Walker is charming and likeable, and he's also the perfect killer. He's cold blooded and downright nasty. Still love that part when he pops the kids balloon for no reason. The film moves fast and the climax aboard a runaway merry go round provides the perfect ending to one great film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Bruno Sometimes Goes a Little Too Far"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While traveling on a train from Washington, D.C. to Long Island, tennis star Guy Haines (Farley Granger) meets Bruno Antony(Robert Walker). They chat amicably and near the end of their journey, Bruno--who knows a great deal about Guy's personal life--makes a bizarre suggestion. He and Guy will exchange murders. He'll murder Guy's clinging wife Miriam, enabling Guy to marry Anne Morton, a senator's daughter; Guy, in turn, will murder Bruno's strict father. Bruno is positive the murders will succeed. If Guy had only known what Bruno's mother told Anne--that "Bruno sometimes goes a little too far"--he would have taken Bruno's plan seriously, instead of dismissing him as a crackpot. Soon Guy learns that Bruno was, dead serious and has kept his end of the bargain: Miriam is found strangled to death in an amusement park. Guy refuses to murder Bruno's father. Incensed, Bruno intends to frame him for Miriam's murder by planting Guy's cigarette lighter at the crime scene. Realizing this, Guy races against time: He must win his tennis match, evade the police who are watching him, and get to the amusement park before Bruno. The showdown between them, a fight on a merry-go-round whirling out of control at tremendous speed, is one of the film's key moments. Casting bay-faced Robert Walker, who had made his mark in boy-next-door roles, as the twisted Bruno was inspired. His performance was excellent. Stealing every scene he's in, Walker's Bruno is certainly one of Hitchcock's most unforgettable villains. Strangers on a Train is one of Hitchcock's best films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So-called "British Version"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Last night, 11th November 1998, I attended the first ever public screening of the so-called "British version" of 'Strangers on a Train'. The print was apparently found in the UCLA archive, but it appears never to have been released anywhere. It might have been a version intended for the UK, but in fact the same version that played in the US was shown in the UK. There are no dramatic changes, but the ending is different, and not as impressive as the original. A few extra bits of dialogue during Guy and Bruno's first meeting are fascinating though. celebrate the centenary of Hitchcock's birth.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Strangers on a Train really shows how Hitchcock can control a film. Based on the novel of the same name by Patricia Highsmith, Hitchcock goes out on a limb and creates the concept of matched pairs. Viewing the film, you will notice two of nearly everything, including Hitchcock's cameo, showing him carrying a double bass. Strangers is one of the strongest homosexual overtoned movies Hitch made. Centering around two male characters played by Robert Walker and Farley Granger, the story develops as they plan an intelligent double murder. Hitch's innovative style really gave this film the twists it needed to develop into the successful movie it became.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Never Underestimate A Hitch Black &amp; White !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Folk often mention Hitchcock's superb directing, here on IMDb, and out in the wider world. It's a few years since I've seen any "Hitch" Movie, but I recall always enjoying them when I did. However, when my father lent me a DVD of "Strangers On A Train", being the shallow cove I am, I groaned a little inwardly when realizing this was an old black and white of yesteryear.But once you start watching... Hitch draws you in! In this case, he benefits from superb performances from principal players. Ruth Roman is gorgeous as Anne, Robert Walker is convincing as the psychotic bad guy. Farley Granger earns empathy as the put-upon hero. Pat Hitchcock also supports well as an innocent foil.There's some superb editing and direction in this movie. The tennis match, for instance, is one Guy must win at all costs, and shows Hitch at his editorial best. Quick cuts between bad guy, commentator and dueling players adds tension and momentum to drama that will have you on the edge of your seat. A classic "hitch moment" occurs when Miriam (Guy's less than noble estranged wife) is strangled by Bruno. Hitch cuts to a reflection of the murder in Miriam's broken glasses. All budding directors should take note! The shot shows Hitch's unique way to capture the intensity of this pivotal movie moment.To top everything: There's the superbly directed "showdown" scene at the fairground. Carousel horses never seemed so menacing! Hitch builds the gripping life-and-death struggle between Bruno and Guy with fabulous edits and remarkably creative camera angles, few other directors could match.What stays with me, though, is the screenplay's close examination of the mind of a psychopath, the terrible ways such a person can affect others, and the warped perspective a psychopath has of the world... Chilling.If you never see another Hitch Movie, consider this one! It's a gem.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hitchcock captures the mindset of murder brilliantly</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tennis player Guy Haines (Granger) gets caught in the wrong place when he meets Bruno Anthony (Walker) on a train who tells him about a double cross murder idea and how they should team up to murder those who cause them unhappiness.The master of suspense has caught fire in a net with this sensational picture that creates a dynamic of intrigue through murder, deception and blackmail.Brimming with The Birds tempo vibe, Strangers on a train gets off to an interesting start as we see a car pull up and we follow two pairs of feet walking towards the train station, after which there is a glorious point of view shot as we see the train moving along the track, and then the real fun begins.Farley Granger is trapped in conversation with an over enthusiastic Robert Walker who berates him with stories and ideas about his life. This conversation is one fine set up to what is to come as when Robert Walker's Bruno mentions a swapping murder idea does the tone of conversation shift and we viewers are left feeling excited for the prospect of what is to come.After a brilliant Hitchcock cameo Haines returns home to find his wife no longer wants a divorce which took him a long time to set up emotionally and physically which after a phone call with Bruno, engages the plot into stalker mode. Bruno, tired with his family goes out and tracks down Haines' wife. The film then takes its deadly notion as we see key elements of the screenplay emphasised to the full. A wonderfully shot murder through the lens of a pair of sunglasses, a deep reflection of similarity in appearance, a plan to return the favour in a carefully constructed map, this film simply has everything.Alfred Hitchcock once more does not disappoint in his telling of a story of corruption and betrayal and manipulation. His direction serves up a wonderful treat, particularly in the action sequences. The tennis match is brilliantly shot, especially one particular notion where the tennis ball bounces right in front and then over the camera. But of all the shots I have seen the British man ever make this film has arguably the best in the carousel sequence come the final stages. The fall and power of this montage of revenge has the emotional necessity of the script and brings a fantastic spectacle. The man diving under the carousel to stop it was beautifully caught by the director and once more this fits the scripting perfectly and epitomizes the film as a genre, a thrilling sequence to a tense and spectacular thriller and crime.Farley Granger's professional is well perceived but the plaudits should go to Robert Walker whose psychotic murder minded man is deliciously mysterious and almost scarily intelligent and yet the pairing is deliciously necessary for the script.Hitchcock delivers once more and this is definitely worth viewing again and again</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tunnel of love</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having just reread Patricia Highsmith's excellent suspenseful novel, we looked forward to watching this film again. Not having seen it in a while, the book still in our mind, we couldn't help noticing how the action had been changed around. We still feel that in the context of the excellent screenplay by Raymond Chandler and Czenzi Ormonde, based on the adaptation of the book by Whitfield Cook. The text was turned with an eye to cinematic terms, not to be confused with the different story line of the novel. Supposedly there were two versions, the one for American audiences, and the other for European consumption. We believe the one presented on cable recently is the one used by Hitchcock for domestic viewing.As this tale begins, we watch men's legs and feet moving into the train that is leaving Washington's Union Station for a trip to New York. At the bar car we finally see those legs belong to two passengers, that will be at the center of everything that follows. Bruno Anthony talks to Guy Haines who is seated across from him. Bruno appears to know a lot about Guy, a tennis player of some notoriety. Guy is not comfortable with the man he finds annoying, at best. Bruno, who has steered the conversation into what is the perfect crime, has a strange proposal for Guy. How about exchanging crimes? He would take care of Guy's wife Miriam, who doesn't want to give him a divorce, and in exchange, Bruno expects his newly made friend to do away with his tyrannical father.Guy is horrified at the indecent proposal he had just heard. He doesn't realize that Bruno is a disturbed young man who will stop at nothing to get what he wants. Guy, gets off at Metcalf to have a talk with Miriam, his estranged wife. Being in love with Anne Morton, he wants to have a clean break from the mousy Miriam, who is keeping him from a possible happiness with the woman he loves. He had gone over to the music store where she works where they are seen having a confrontation, in one of the listening booths, as many of the customers watch in horror to their fight. She is adamant in not letting him divorce her.Bruno, who has plans of his own, decides to take a look at the situation first hand. He arrives at Metcalf, a small town, to locate Miriam. He does find her, following her and two male friends to the amusement park in the outskirts of town. Miriam, who notices the strange man tailing her, doesn't know what is going on. Little prepares her for what this mysterious man wants to do to her.Guy, who has been seeing the gorgeous Anne Morton, the daughter of a US senator, is distraught after seeing Miriam. He comes to Washington to be with Anne. Nothing prepares Guy for what he is about to learn: Miriam has been strangled under strange circumstances. The young man knows right away that somewhat Bruno was the assassin. Unfortunately, Bruno has plans for Guy: he must keep his side of the bargain by killing his own father, Mr. Anthony."Strangers on a Train" is one of Alfred Hitchcock best films. Together with "Vertigo", "Shadow of a Doubt", and "Notorious", this film is right up there among the best the director left as his legacy. The novel of Ms. Highsmith is highly charged with homo erotic innuendos. Obviously, Bruno Anthony was gay and saw an opportunity with the weaker Guy Haines to have his way and dominate him, even if the latter one did not want to do his part of the bargain. There are many signs pointing to this conclusion. Mr. Hitchcock plays with our perception of the crime that has been committed. Bruno is a man with a seductive mind who the viewer knows has done a heinous deed, yet we don't cower in fear every time he comes on the scene.The love Guy feels for Anne is affected by the way Bruno is manipulating the situation. Anne realizes that Bruno has an ulterior motive. Even her younger sister, Barbara, knows how to detect a phony whenever she sees one. Bruno misjudges the situation thinking he can blackmail Guy, who has a mind of his own. The ultimate confrontation at the amusement park is one of the best sequences Mr. Hitchcock ever conceived.The casting of this film is what made it work so well. An inspired Robert Walker is the epitome of evil as he proves with his Bruno Anthony. He is seductive and he tries to get Guy, perhaps for a sexual relationship. Farley Granger, who portraits Guy, shows a vulnerable side that Bruno wants to explore. Mr. Granger played in another of Mr. Hitchcock's films "Rope", where he is also seen as a closeted gay man. Although not given the splashiest role, Mr. Granger is believable. Ruth Roman is seen as Anne Morton, a decent woman in love. Patricia Hitchcock, the director's own daughter makes an excellent contribution with her Barbara, the wiser younger sister of Anne. Kasey Rogers plays Miriam and Leo G. Carroll is Senator Morton.Adding to our overall enjoyment of the film is Robert Burks amazing black and white cinematography. Dimitri Tiomkin did an outstanding job with his musical score. Alfred Hitchcock appears briefly in one of his famous cameos almost at the start of the film. The director did a fine job in bringing all the elements into one of his most satisfying pictures that will be loved by his fans.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Underrated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Strangers On A Train, the 1951 black and white film by Alfred Hitchcock, is a damned good movie- with many of the requisite Hitchcockian flourishes, but it is not a great film, despite many great aspects about it. The reason for this devolves down to one basic fact- it's merely a melodrama, not a true drama. Melodrama always depends upon the propulsion of the plot by the characters within doing the dumbest possible things to get to the next scene. Melodrama thrives on the lowest common denominator. This, of course, does not lessen the enjoyability of the melodrama- be it Hollywood film, soap opera, pro wrestling, etc., but it does remove the work sufficiently from the realistic so that it shows its artifice too much, and therefore never fully involves an engaged viewer.Strangers On A Train includes many recurring Hitchcockian themes- the wrongly accused man, doubles, guilt, assumptions, and, yes, homosexuality. This was a film that came out only a few years after Hitchcock's homosexually themed Rope, in 1948, and even has one of that film's stars- Farley Granger, in this film's lead role. Again, he is a weakling character controlled by a cunning, psychopathic character with definite homosexual leanings; only this time Granger does not play a homosexual character. The film was based upon the first published novel of Patricia Highsmith, whose later Ripley novels earned her the nickname Mistress Of Suspense, in counterpoint to Hitchcock's moniker as Master Of Suspense. The film was adapted for Hitchcock by Whitfield Cook, then handed over to crime novelist Raymond Chandler, who wanted to change many elements. Hitchcock resisted, then gave the final job of adding dialogue to Czenzi Ormonde, and an uncredited Ben Hecht. It's a good screenplay, but, as with many Hitchcock films, it's almost all surface. The depth in most Hitchcock films comes from the actors and their subtleties, not the written words. In this sense Hitchcock's reputation as the ultimate puppetmaster is well earned. Depth was the reason the film was made and actors hired, or else Hitchcock would likely have been satisfied with his storyboards published as early graphic novels?. I suspect that the reason that this film has been ignored, in favor of lesser Hitchcockian fare like Suspicion, To Catch A Thief, or The Man Who Knew Too Much, is because none of the stars in it were superstars. The above mentioned were all good solid works, but they lacked the depth this film does, on however a superficially 'deep' level, in contrast to similar films coming out from Europe at the same time. But, it certainly is a very good film, by any measure, with some deeper subtexts than the script alone entails. If only Hitchcock had been more at home in probing deeper into motivations, and grounding some of his films in reality more, he could have moved past being a mere technical genius, and graced the realm of high art more often than he did, that realm where the European directors did not fear to tread, where high art and mass appeal were not seen as mutually opposing forces. Strangers On A Train is almost a definitive, or archetypal, Hitchcock film in that it has all his film canon's glories and flaws. It is not film noir, nor is it really a thriller, as commonly thought of. We know what is going on at all times, so the suspense is not a whodunit? but a willthevillainsucceed? And it is a darkly comic one at that. Humor is used to gloss over many failures in life, and this film proves that statement true. When you watch Strangers On A Train you will wince, chuckle, smile, shake your head, be frustrated and relaxed, and if that is not the sign of a work of art that does more right than wrong, there are always new Hollywood releases to watch and wince to. And that's a fact not to smile nor chuckle over.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have never seen this in the theater, my second viewing was tonight on big screen DVD as opposed to old VHS tape from rental store.Saucey for it's time and I'm sure the Hayes code was pushed to it's limits.Hitch's pallet here is the "game play" between two combatants. And yes if Guy calls the cops on Bruno right away the movie is 63 min shorter, HELLO people do you always make the best or most logical choice. How many times have you been in either person's shoes and made the right choice? For the love of God it's called poetic license..However as Guy sees the situation he has found himself in he takes it upon himself to rectify it. He does not solicit help nor does he lie to his would be new wife. Her defense of him sets off the final show down with Bruno feeling he has one more card to play.For the cop shot-ting an innocent person in pre-cam corder days and before rules of engagement this type of thing did happen. In the post Rodney King world a presidential candidate backed the police in sending 43 bullets at an unarmed man. If you haven't seen or witnessed outrageous police behavior your blind or have an application pending for the academeny.Back to the movie...Go watch it with. Try and wear a post WWII filter and pretend your seeing a great suspense movie like many did for the first time back then, and sure it's been copied since but your looking at one of the source of inspiration for many that followed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Alfred Hitchcock is one of the greatest writer/directors of ALL time and he will continue to be for many a year to come. In this film we have 2 strangers, pro tennis player Guy and a psychopathic mama's boy Bruno, who tells Guy of a plan of how 2 strangers can get away with murder... a plan which Guy does not know, he plans to go through with.The film is well acted/written/directed/produced and more, the film is so well written that you can even ignore the scenes that don't really add up (I don't know why a cop would shoot into a merry go round with more public domain on it) but apart from those scenes, it is really a very well executed and great movie.The film as just missed out on a place on the top 100, but is 103rd on the list, and even though I would think it should be higher then that, I am glad it is recognized as one of the best films in cinematic history.Overall, I recommend this to people who are fans of Alfred Hitchcock films or people who like movies and the cinematic experience. Really, the film is quite good and worth a watch for anyone, but for some it is harder to get through then others. I rate this film 79%.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Dangers of Celebrity From Psychopaths</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When Alfred Hitchcock made STRANGERS ON A TRAIN it was a harbinger for the bulk of the film going public that he was back at the top of his form. From 1946 to 1950 his films were not box office successes, and his contractual arrangement with David O. Selznick ended because of this. Actually he made some really good films in the period, such as NOTORIOUS, SPELLBOUND, UNDER CAPRICORN, ROPE, and (my opinion) STAGESTRUCK. But while NOTORIOUS AND SPELLBOUND were liked, the audiences were turned off by Hitch's attempts at experimentation: his use of a dream sequence by Salvator Dali in SPELLBOUND was acceptable, as was the setting among psychiatrists. But the experiment with long takes in ROPE confused the public (making ignore the merits of that film), and the willingness of Hitch to have the audience fooled by a lie told by a leading character in a flashback was disliked - far more disliked then it deserved to be - in STAGESTRUCK. A matter of bad timing for UNDER CAPRICORN (it was released just as the scandal of it's star Ingrid Bergman and Roberto Rosallini broke out) made it seem to be a failure (which it wasn't). THE PARADINE CASE was another failure - and one that really had little in it's favor.With STRANGERS ON A TRAIN, Hitchcock shied away from the special tricks that interested him in the recent films. Instead he concentrated on his favorite themes of shared guilt and mistaken identity. Based on a novel by Patricia Highsmith, the story was of how Guy Haines, a professional tennis player, meets a fan of his - Bruno Anthony, a playboy - who is traveling on a cross-country train at the same time as the athlete. Bruno is talkative and fawning, and Guy views him as one of the typical fans he has met...if a little eccentric, with his talk of wanting to be on the first rocket to outer space. But Bruno knows all about Guy's personal problems. He is married to a promiscuous young woman named Miriam, and is in love with Anne Morton, daughter of a Senator. Bruno knows that Miriam won't divorce her successful celebrity husband. Bruno mentions how he can sympathize - he hates his stepfather, who is constantly criticizing him. Then Bruno mentions (sort of off the cuff) an idea he has about two men - technically strangers - exchanging murders for each other and then committing two perfect, unsolvable crimes instead of fumbling them. Guy listens to the idea - and agrees it is an interesting idea. The train reaches Guy's destination, and his last comment is like a validation of the idea. He just does not realize that the "eccentric" Bruno is a sociopath, and believes Guy has just agreed to the two killing each other's foe!It's a wonderfully simple plot actually. Bruno, of course does kill Miriam, but he fully expects Guy to live up to the murder agreement and kill his stepfather. Guy is horrified - and worse, he finds that he is the police department's number one suspect. When Bruno, to encourage Guy, mentions he has the latter's lighter (he pocketed it on the train) and can plant it at the murder site, Guy finds himself in deeper problems - how to avoid the police, and how to control (if possible) the insane Bruno?Hitch always planned the shots of his film carefully, so that from the start we see both our "heroes" from their feet heading towards their fateful meeting in the train with each other. There are constant cross-contacts used in the film to show how the two men are drawn into each other's orbits. It is like fate drawing them together. Yet both have their own personality - and Hitch, with a typical twist, makes the mad Bruno actually more of an attractive figure. His scheme may be vicious (it will kill two people if successful, and he will have Guy live up to the agreement no matter what) but he has a zest for life. One suspects that once Guy too had one, but his marriage's failure, coupled with his now dating a socially prominent woman, has made him more circumspect and dull than he was.The cast is good too. Robert Walker probably had his finest role in this film (only a year before his death). It was a far cry from the homespun boy-next-door of SINCE YOU WENT AWAY or THE CLOCK. His lithe figure also looked quite elegant in tales in several scenes. As Guy Farley Granger acts like a cousin of his co-murderer in ROPE, especially as the circumstances make him increasingly suspicious to the authorities (as his earlier role made his jittery behavior increasingly suspicion to Jimmy Stewart). As for the ladies, Kasie Rogers is properly sluttish as Miriam - enabling the audience to be prepared for her demise (in a famous sequence shot in the reflection of her eyeglasses) so that they actually are cheering Bruno in his act of evil. Patricia Hitchcock appears as the younger sister of Anne (Ruth Roman), who bears a close resemblance to Miriam, and accidentally sets off Bruno at a social occasion. She plays this rare role well. Ruth Roman is properly supportive of Granger, but her role is limiting because she is establishment in her background, and somewhat low keyed. Other supporting performers, Leo G. Caroll as the Senator, Marion Lorne (usually a comedian) as Bruno's dotty mother, and Norma Varden as an unexpected recipient of violence from Walker are all shown to best advantage - all at the hand of a master.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A suggested exchange of murders</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alfred Hitchcock's "Strangers on a Train" is about, not surprisingly, two strangers that meet on a train. One of the strangers proposes that they each murder someone that the other person would like to see gone.Robert Walker is perfect as Bruno Anthony, the stranger who suggests the murder plan. He manages to make his character thoroughly unnerving throughout the film. Farley Granger is also effective as the "normal" Guy Haines and the supporting cast is also solid.This film never wants for tension. Walker's character is anxiety invoking for Haines and the audience. The story is well-developed and there are a number of turns that keep it interesting throughout. At the end, the tennis scene and follow-up are excellent, even in terms of the tennis rallies themselves. The technique of showing competing characters in different locations in a tight race was tense and highly effective.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>He ain't called "The Master of Suspense" for nothing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alfred Hitchcock is widely known as "The Master of Suspense" and with good reason. Nobody could fashion such white-knuckle tension through the mere power of suggestion as he could. Viewed today, anyone of his masterpieces is just as thrilling and quickly paced as when they originally were released. A perfect example of his brilliance would be "Strangers on a Train". The concept is memorable, but many of the events seem a bit far fetched and even ridiculous on closer inspection. However, Hitchcock's direction is so masterful he makes even seemingly implausible situations brimming with suspense. "Strangers on a Train" remains one of his most suspenseful films. Its one of Hitchcock's most interesting variants on the "Wrong Man" theme.The performances are a bit uneven. As usual, Farley Granger is rather wooden. Just as in "Rope", hes completely overshadowed by his costar. Robert Walker gives easily his best performance as the psychotic Bruno Anthony. Hitchcock knows how to manipulate the audience into liking his character. Hes witty, refined, and unafraid to speak his mind. Hes a much more compelling protagonist than Farley Granger's. Add to this several delightful supporting performances (Patricia Hitchcock, Leo G. Carroll, Marion Lorne) and another great score from Dimitri Tiomkin and you have film of perfect entertainment value. (9/10)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Two strangers, one immortal masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Patricia Highsmith's gripping tale of the meeting of two strangers with nothing in common except the desire of murder, was the origin of one of the Master of Suspense's most praised and successful movies. Overshadowed by the rest of his 50s movies, "Strangers on a Train" is one of Alfred Hitchcock's best films, and definitely a landmark not only in his career, but also in history of film.During a small trip on a train from Washington to New York, Bruno Anthony (Roger Walker) meets tennis professional Guy Haines (Farley Granger) and soon a friendly bond is set between them. During lunch, they discover that they have something in common: both have someone in their lives they would like to kill. Bruno comes with a bizarre intriguing solution proposing that each should kill the other's "problem". Guy takes the conversation as a joke, but soon he'll discover that Bruno was really serious about it, dead serious about it.Hitchcock's takes us to a haunting dark world in this movie as Bruno reveals as one of the scariest sociopaths on screen. Robert Walker literally steals every scene he is in and domains the screen with a powerful and unforgettable performance as Bruno Anthony. Sadly, it was his last performance but what a performance is this. Farley Granger is also very good as Guy, although Walker totally steals the show.The complex relation between Guy and Bruno is something that Hitchcock explores with brilliant care (considering the strict rules of the time). Bruno is the Mephistopheles who just granted Guy/Faust's most desired wish and is waiting for his partner to pay the debt. He is the tempter who brings Guy to the dark side, while Guy tries to escape his pact even when he really enjoys the results of it.Guilt and fear corrode him and Farley Granger makes the best of the character. The sexual tension between them is also something that, like Highsmith in the novel, Hitchcock uses to increase the suspense and tension in the audience. While in the American version of the film this is not as apparent, the British cut implies it subtly and it is possibly the best version of the film.Hitchcock cleverly creates haunting imagery using Washington's landscape as stage for his noir-inspired tale. His style was totally developed at that time and his use of light and shadows is simply brilliant. The beautiful camera-work and the very creative set-pieces (the tennis match scene is simply perfect) complete this film that is nothing short of perfect.This often forgotten masterpiece marks the beginning of Hitchcock's supreme reign over American cinema and, like his previous work "Stage Fright", continues the walk through the dark side that would lead to "Psycho"'s Norman Bates and "Vertigo"'s Scottie Ferguson. It is definitely an important film in the Master's career and one that everyone interested in cinema must watch at least once. 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"It's Too Fantastic!"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It was tempting to put as the one-line summary of this film "Farley Granger's On A Train", or even "Bruno Picks Up Guy En Route To Metcalf", but I resisted. Oddly enough, this straight-faced murder thriller would be well-served by frivolous captions, having itself a strangely flippant feel.Two men meet by chance on a train journey between Washington and New York. One is a clean-cut sports hero, the other a languid rich boy. Each has an inconvenient family-member - in the case of Guy the tennis star, it is his unfaithful wife, who stands between him and Anne, the woman he loves, and in Bruno's case it is his overbearing father. Bruno proposes that they swap murders - each should kill the other's problem relative. This will make the murders undetectable, because in each case there will be nothing to link the killer to the crime.We meet both men by means of their feet - which is how they encounter each other. The opening sequence has each man making his way to the train, filmed from the knees down. Guy is sober and conservative, and the tennis racquets dangled by the porter tell us that he is an athlete. Bruno's flashy shoes give him away - he is a mincing mommy's boy. As they sit opposite one another in the train's observation car, their feet brush ... and Bruno has created his opportunity.The relationship between the two men has a definite homosexual flavour to it. Their brief encounter smacks of a gay pick-up in an age when such things had to be done surreptitiously, and Guy's gradual relenting - agreeing first to a drink, then a meal - allows the flirtatious Bruno to take liberties. Robert Walker is wonderful as the unhinged Bruno, by turns beguiling and sinister. Farley Granger makes a good Guy Haines, the handsome tennis star whose girlfriend (Anne Morton, played by the lovely Ruth Roman) is smarter than he is.Raymond Chandler co-wrote the screenplay, and it shows. The Guy-Bruno pairing of opposites is imitated in the Hennessy-Hammond twosome, the cops yoked together by their work. Of course, neither Bruno nor Guy has to bother with work, the one being idly rich, the other being groomed for a career in federal politics. The merry-go-round stands as a double metaphor - firstly a symbol of these characters' frothy lives, the pleasant treadmill which they cannot quit, and latterly (when it gets out of control) a symbol of Bruno's psychosis, attractive in the early stages but terrifying when it breaks free of its constraints.The first fairground scene is vintage Hitchcock. Miriam loses our sympathy from the outset, cavorting with two toy boys. This is necessary, lest we blame Guy for her subsequent fate. Bruno's brooding presence is the very distillation of evil. His meanness to the little boy with the balloon strips away the veneer of his charm. We see Bruno unbuttoned for the first time. Miriam's awareness of Bruno tautens our nerves almost unbearably - she vacillates between sexual fear and sexual fascination, a duality which is reflected in the jollity of the setting and the ugliness of what we know will happen.Bruno stalks both Guy and the film itself like an evil angel. We see him black against the floodlit monument, a troubling speck against the imposing regularity of the columns. In the crowd at the tennis match, Bruno alone fails to follow the flight of the ball, side to side. His head remains cruelly still, staring at Guy. He brushes aside his final opportunity for repentance, sticking to his malicious campaign to damage Guy long after it can achieve anything, in a nihilistic negation of life itself.Some of the film's propositions don't hold water. Primarily, it is too much to believe that an aspiring politician and public hero like Guy would be duped into supposing that he can't go to the cops over the behaviour of this crank. In the atmospheric scene at the wrought-iron gate, Guy slips over to Bruno's side of the gate when the police car arrives, symbolising his 'crossing-over'. In real life, such a man would be too level-headed, and would have too much to lose, to be swayed by Bruno. Leo G. Carroll is far too English to be acceptable as a Washington senator, and police officers investigating murders don't confront suspects with their own alibi wirnesses. The notion that Guy would give his police 'minders' the slip and appear to be following Bruno's orders is crazy. If he were caught before exposing Bruno, he would not have a leg to stand on.It is Anne who solves the crime. She spots the elaborate necktie which proves that the visitor is no stranger, and she sees the significance of the spectacles. As an interesting footnote, Anne's kid sister Barbara, the girl with the big personality, was played by Hitchcock's daughter Patricia.The film has some characteristically flamboyant Hitchcock moments. The scene in the study is shot from a bird's eye view, both to evoke a sense of unease and to emphasise Guy's suppressed feelings of guilt - we see what Hennessy cannot, the concealed gun in the bureau drawer. The final climax is pure Hitchcock, with Guy needing to beat Bruno to the island, but first having to get through a five-set tennis match.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fascinating</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a college student who watched this movie for the first time last year in my film class. I'd had very minimal experience with Hitchcock before this class, with just the standards (Psycho, The Birds) under my belt. This one fascinated me though. From the slightly creepy homosexual undertones to the double scenes, it amazed me. How would someone get the idea to make a movie about a matched pair and then make two of every single scene??? What a genius. Absolutely fantastic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This time I don't buy it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Two men (strangers) meet (on a train), as per the title. One is a tennis player and one is a pretty creepy guy with "big ideas" (read: the enemy), they hit it off pretty well, but the second man turns out to get too involved with his ideas and ends up killing the tennis player's wife for him after the tennis player nonchalantly mentions he wouldn't mind having her out of the way. Now it's a rush to see what the tennis player will do now that he's a suspect and the other man keeps appearing to urge him to kill the stalker's father, via an agreement he didn't make.So it's basically all of Hitchcock's usual fare... a man on the run, wrongly accused; a man blackmailing him; bumbling cops; a woman who wants to figure it out but doesn't know who to trust initially before fully trusting the protagonist; and old ladies who giggle over discussions of murder.This time I don't buy it, though. The whole lighter thing comes off as a real gimmick to me (even when the stalker guy drops it in the grate... after the initial suspense, it doesn't matter anyway 'cause he's waiting for dusk.) I couldn't believe that there isn't some way the protagonist couldn't have gone to the police and proved that he wasn't guilty, if anything because of the two characters they were. The drunken professor was a useless side-note. This movie is all of Hitchcock's stuff, but none of his experimentation which is really the stuff I like.In all, this is the most suspenseful of his movies, but I can't gather up the energy to care for it. Once again, I have an issue with the characters. I'm just so used to Hitchcock telling me the same story over and over again that frankly I'm beginning to feel like he's repeating himself. The guy had a few recurring themes, sure, but this is starting to fall into merely obsessive pondering of the many different ways to present the same internal fear Hitchcock has of being wrongfully imprisoned. And with each movie of his I see, instead of said fear making me feel like I'm seeing some auteur at work, I'm beginning to see a guy who needs to relax a little. I like his much more experimental stuff, where he plays with camera and imagery and narrative and design. This "suspense thriller" stuff with the typical motifs is getting very dull, which is a terrible thing.--PolarisDiB</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another great Hitchcock film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hitchcock is famous for making crime dramas. Some of his most praised ones include "Rear Window", "Dial M for Murder", "Vertigo", "North by Northwest", and "Rope" (which I will be watching soon). He has great talent in making so many of them succeed in so many different ways. He gives them suspenseful and disturbing feelings which still feel unnerving today. "Strangers on a Train" may not be the very best film he's ever made, but it's still very effective.Guy Haines, a tennis star, meets a fan of his named Bruno Antony while riding on a train. Bruno tells him his theory for how 2 strangers can get away with murder. He says that if 2 unrelated people swap murders and kill the person that the other wants dead, there would be no clues to connect, and both of them will be able to get away. Guy Haines doesn't take him seriously, but Bruno plans to implement his theory.Bruno Antony served as a very memorable villain. Instead of acting hostile or impatient, he would simply stalk Guy everywhere he went, and would continue to try and get him to follow through with his end of the deal. This made for some unnerving scenes which made the viewer wonder what he would do to Guy. Bruno would constantly stalk him in public, call him, and send him supplies necessary for murdering his father. As Bruno started to talk to Guy's family, the movie continued to raise tension as the movie made the viewer wonder whether he was going to do something to his family. Also, Bruno Antony was played exceptionally well by Robert Walker. He commands every scene he's in, and he captures just the right mood for Bruno's character.The conversation that Bruno and Guy have on the subway near the beginning of the film is very thought-provoking. It makes the viewer wonder if such a perfect murder like the one that Hitchcock described actually is possible. It seems to make sense, and if the criminal doing the crime does a few minor things to protect his identity, the crime could be executed flawlessly. The film keeps the viewer believing that this crime would work throughout the film, and he does this so well that the viewer starts to suspect that a happy ending is next to impossible. A great tactic that Hitchcock did in this movie and "Dial M for Murder" is that he created 2 crimes that seemed very believable and creative. It wasn't until the ending where he revealed a clue so minimal that the viewer likely would not have ever seen it coming no matter how much they were paying attention. What makes the film more terrifying is that the crime Bruno thought of could easily happen to any person. The chances of it happening are highly unlikely, but it's the idea that anyone could be a murderer which is central to the movie and that's what makes it work better.Hitchcock is a master at visual set pieces, and he utilized his skill for them here. One of the scenes happens near the beginning where it shows Bruno stalking Miriam, the person who he plans to kill, at a carnival. Since she's with 2 of her boyfriends, the viewer has doubts that Bruno can overpower all of them. However, the film shows both of her boyfriends doing a "High Striker" carnival game. None of them get it to the top. However, Bruno goes up after both of them, and he gets it to the top easily. Later, it shows her and her boyfriends in a boat going through a "Tunnel of Love". Bruno is right behind them. It shows their shadows on a wall with Bruno's shadow slowly moving closer to them. The shot cuts to the opening where it shows Miriam screaming. However, they go out and it shows one of her boyfriends simply messing around with her. Hitchcock tricks the viewer in that scene.Another great visual set piece comes at one of the film's most iconic scenes. Guy is at the tennis game waiting to play next. The camera is pointed at the crowd. Every body is turning their heads to follow the tennis ball. For a second, the viewer might smile a bit. However, the camera zooms in to show Bruno staring directly at Guy, giving the scene a sudden, serious tone. Another scene happens when Guy is quietly wandering through the darkness of Bruno's home. A dog growling at him at the top of the stairs throws the viewer off from what they think might happen, and the scene somewhat surprises the viewer.Bruno's perfect murder theory was well-thought out. However, I never understood why Bruno told Anne about his plan of putting a lighter at the scene of the crime to frame Guy. That was a very foolish decision for him to do. Anne could've easily told her family about what he did, and they could've all attempted to stop him, ruining his plan. This isn't necessarily a gigantic plot hole, but it still bugs me as it effects the entire final act. Also, I felt like the final confrontation between Guy and Bruno being on an out-of-control merry-go-round wasn't exactly the best setting Hitchcock could've picked as it was slightly cheesy for such a serious crime film about murder.In conclusion, this was a very great Hitchcock film. Bruno was a great villain, and great acting plus clever visual set pieces made Bruno pretty memorable. Hitchcock's thought-provoking perfect murder theory was intriguing, and it was very interesting. It may have a few minor flaws, but it has still accomplished a lot, and it was well worth my time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Our mamas always said "never talk with strangers", you never know what you're gonna get...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>All our mothers told us to never talk with strangers. Unfortunately, we often tend to overlook these childhood advice on the simple basis that we're grown-ups, but this is perhaps the most important lesson from one of Alfred Hitchcock's most popular film, "Strangers on a Train".When tennis-player Guy Haines (Farley Granger) is approached by co-traveler Bruno Anthony (Robert Walker), the latter becomes so annoyingly nosy, asking so many indiscreet questions about column gossips and Guy's divorce, and gets so eager to expose his theory of the 'perfect murder' that we can't believe that Guy's 'lunatic'-radar didn't sound alarm bells in his mind. But Guy is a soft one, he lets Bruno talk, too shy or too polite to cut the discussion short, unaware that each hesitation gives Bruno enough territory to conquer. And this is integral to the whole pervert psychological game between the two leads, Guy's weakness allowed Bruno to explicitly describe his idea of the perfect crime: crisscross, much to Guy's disbelief, and to our pervert fascination.The idea is simple: the two men have someone in their lives they would rather dispose of, so basically, they swap the subsequent murders: Guy kills Bruno's father, and Bruno kills Guy's vulgar soon-to-be divorced pregnant wife Miriam (Laura Elliott). That way, each one can get himself a perfect alibi and no one gets ever suspected. Bruno solves his Oedipal issues and Guy can marry the classier (and politically interesting) senator's daughter Anne Morton (Ruth Roman). It is a clever idea, although morally repugnant. However, there's never one word or attitude from Guy to convince Bruno that he's not interested. Guy nodded to Bruno's project, afraid to hurt him, out of shyness and weakness, so Bruno might be an evil lunatic but Guy is guilty out of weakness and spinelessness.There was an interesting quote from Truman Capote in "In Cold Blood" about the two thugs who massacred the Cluster family, they weren't killers and would never have killed anyone alone, but together they formed a sort of third personality that could take the plunge. This duality is omnipresent in "Strangers on a Train" and since Hitch has never been stingy on expressive visuals, doubles are constant leitmotifs in the film starting with the iconic image of the two railroad tracks crossing each other, illustrating Bruno's twisted idea. Characters too are in two copies, two women with glasses (Pat Hitchcock as Anne's kid sister bears a resemblance with the victim), there are two cops, two sets of feet walking, two glasses of whiskey ordered, and ultimately two murderers. Guy isn't a murderer, but after his wife's death, and without any alibi to hang his hope on, he's incapable to accuse Bruno and inevitably acts guilty, this is a side effect of the crisscross. And I think the popularity of "Strangers on a Train" is due to Hitchcock's fondness on concepts: movies that could be summed up in a simple but clever idea, "Rope", "Lifeboat", "Shadow of a Doubt" ? and this one had the meatiest one. Speaking for myself, I was so enthusiastic about the premise that I felt cheated about the story only featuring one, I wanted the crisscross, but then I realized it couldn't work, with two guilty guys, the film could only be as a detective story. In this case, it's a story of guilt, responsibility, harassment and personal torment.Indeed, there is in "Strangers on a Train" the same grain that would make such films as "Fatal Attraction", when an impressionable protagonist gets carried away by a manipulative and dangerous villain. The performances are crucial, Granger is nervous, and tries to slip away from the situations rather than facing them, Bruno is a spoiled mama's boy who believes things should be done his way, yet coming from a wealthy background, he can easily hide his dark nature behind a friendly smile. And this is why he's one of Hitch's best villains, Bruno creates a sort of active/passive interaction that gives a few hints of homoerotic subtext, as if Bruno was a sort of Alpha male who had the guts to follow his wicked instinct while Guy hypocritically condemns the murder, but benefits from its effect while hiding with his future in-laws, still concerned by his political ambitions. And on the basis of this two-character study, the film takes off, driven with a nervous energy and highlighted by a superb black and white cinematography from the murder seen through the victim's eyeglasses' lens to the villain whose head doesn't move while watching the tennis game. In Patricia Highsmith's novel, Guy was an architect, but the choice of a tennis player is more than a colorful addition, it contributes to the thrilling sequence where Guy tries to win the game in three sets so he can confront Bruno in the scene of crime, only to be delayed by his opponent's determination to win the game. Bruno is also delayed by a little incident involving the one piece of evidence of the crime and it's like a symbolic tennis game between the film's players. This sequence is only the first high point before one of the most iconic climactic scenes from a Hitchcock film. Hitch loved to set his climaxes in memorable places, in "Strangers on a Train", it's one of his most spectacular and spellbinding moments, and such moments were necessary because the script isn't devoid of plot contrivances and demand a lot in terms of suspension of disbelief. But Hitchcock cared for plausibility without being enslaved by rational requirements, he wanted to delight the audiences with cinematic tricks and feature psychologically absorbing situation. Hitch could get away with it, because he mastered the technique well-enough to con us and make the unbelievable believable, not because it is, but because we want to, for the sake of enjoyment. And "Strangers on a Train" IS one of his most enjoyable films? and one hell of a noir thriller.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow! What a movie! I was on edge the entire film. Fantastic Alfred Hitchcock installment into the field of movie entertainment. My favorite scene (amongst many) is the calliope scene at the end and would LOVE to know how they managed that merry-go-round wreck! Look for Hitchcock's famous cameo appearance, this time within the first 10:30 minutes of the film. Hint: It has to do with passengers getting on the train as Farley Granger's character gets off. Enough said! :) Truly a great suspense film and story! The timing, lighting, plot, and all components are superbly weaved through throughout this celluloid. Robert Walker creates a superbly creepy character, as doesn't he in most films he's cast in such a role?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of my favorite Hitchcock movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of my favorite Hitchcock movies ? it has a fantastic premise and cast, and also one of his very best murder scenes (and that's saying something!) Hitchcock uses great economy in the first half of the film; right out of the chute two strangers meet on a train, and one proposes the 'perfect murder', one in which there is no apparent motive because the two simply 'criss cross' murders for each other.Robert Walker is absolutely perfect as the sociopath who proposes this scheme to the straight-laced tennis player, played well by Farley Granger. He wants his overbearing father out of the picture, and knows that Granger wants a divorce from his wife, having done his homework. Granger politely declines, and while his motivation increases when his adulterous wife (Laura Elliot) manipulatively tells him she no longer wants to split from him in the next scene, he still wants no part of murder. However, in the very next scene Walker goes forward with his 'end of the bargain' anyway, stalking Elliot at a carnival in an outstanding sequence. She's aware of him staring at her and even flirts with him a little bit, and as he follows her through the Tunnel of Love out to 'Magic Isle' it's seriously spine-tingling. Hitchcock shows her getting strangled in a reflection from her glasses which have fallen to the ground. These first few scenes, from the train to Magic Isle, are a masterpiece.Granger is of course horrified to hear about this, and while he intends to move on to woman he's already been seeing (Ruth Roman), he doesn't intend on committing a murder he never agreed to. Walker begins stalking him and putting pressure on him, and there are fantastic scenes at the Jefferson Memorial (him staring down a distance and high up on the stairs), as well as at a tennis match (the crowd following a volley, turning their heads back and forth; Walker staring straight ahead at Granger).It is true that the film slows down slightly in the second half, but it's by no means 'slow' ? there are several other great scenes, we feel real tension as Granger finds himself mired in a creepy lunatic's fantasy come to life (channeling Hitchcock's 'wrong man' theme), and it has a thrilling climax, but I won't spoil it any further. I have to say I loved the spunky character played by Patricia Hitchcock, the director's daughter, and it's a shame she didn't get more work as an actor. It's also a shame that Robert Walker died at age 32, shortly after the film's release. He certainly lives on in this role, and this film more than stands the test of time. Excellent.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Hitchcock Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie begins on a train. Guy, a tennis player, is recognized by Bruno, a wealthy man. Bruno is attracted to Guy, and strikes up conversations with him. Guy, who wants to be left alone, politely tries to end them, but Bruno is stubborn. It doesn't take long for him to start talking about his favorite subject, murder. Bruno's theory for the perfect murder is for two people to swap murders. The easiest way to get caught is motive, but there's no a stranger has no motive, so he wouldn't be caught. Bruno proposes that, in return for killing Guy's cheating wife so he doesn't have to get a divorce to marry Ann, Guy kills Bruno's father. Guy just says his theory sounds alright and gets off the train. Bruno, however, either mistakes it for confirmation or starts it anyway so that Guy is forced to follow through.Guy is a good guy. He doesn't want to put up with his cheating wife, but he doesn't want her killed either. Once Bruno confronts him after the murder, his first instinct is to go to the police, but Bruno convinces him that Guy's story won't satisfy the police, and Bruno tries to blackmail Guy into killed his father.The cinematography is very good, particularly the murder reflected in the glasses. That is an impressive shot.The climax of the film is intense but too far-fetched. Guy is chasing Bruno onto a carousel full of children, and a cop wildly shoots at Guy, narrowly missing countless children, and kills the innocent carousel operator, who turns the carousel onto its highest speed. I can't believe that a cop could be this stupid, killing an innocent man and endangering many children all for a murder suspect he has no evidence on. Also, the carousel is going at a dangerously fast speed. Why make a carousel that spins so fast its deadly? It was never meant to be used at that setting, so why make it possible? The brave old man who volunteers to shut it off ends up making it worse and causes it to collapse. Bruno is killed, but no one checks on the children's safety. Also, Guy claims that Bruno has his lighter, so Guy asks if he can reach down and check Bruno for it. The cop rightfully denies him because Guy would be able to plant the lighter on Bruno if he didn't have it already. But why would Guy ask the cop if he himself could check? Why not just ask the cop to check for him? Why doesn't the cop offer to check instead?Overall, this is a great film. All the performances were good, and the story was interesting. I really believed that Guy has morals. Bruno has a knack for sounding convincing. I was really interested to see how it all plays out. The climax on the carousel was stretched my suspension of disbelief too far, but it still ended well. Bruno has scarred Guy, and the next time a stranger on a train recognizes him, Guy's paranoia leads him away.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another masterpiece from Alfred Hitchcock...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Strangers on a Train" is a thriller movie in which we watch two men who meet each other for their first time in a train. The one is a famous tennis player and the other one is a simple man who is really interested on the life of the tennis player. After this meeting this simple but psychotic socialite man reveals his true expectations of this meeting which is a theory on how two completely strangers can get away with a murder.I liked this movie because of the plot which I found really good for those times and I also liked very much for one more time the direction of Alfred Hitchcock who made a really good job. About the interpretation I have to admit that I was surprised by Robert Walker's interpretation who played as Bruno Antony and he was really good. I also liked the interpretation of Farley Granger who played as Guy Haines.Finally I believe that "Strangers on a Train" is a good movie to spend your time and I also believe that if you are a fan of thriller movies then I am sure that you will love it. The most appropriate word to define this movie is suspense and this I believe that comes from the interpretation of Robert Walker and not from Farley Granger. In my opinion the second one did not kept me so in tense such Robert Walker did, that's maybe because Robert Walker was the bad one but I wanted to say that too.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have always loved suspenseful movies and I have found that the ones that work best at generating suspense for me involve situations where I can almost see the scenario playing out in real life. For instance, Paranormal Activity tells the story of a demon tormenting a young married couple. It's hard to believe that such a scenario could happen in real life, but I found myself convinced that demons were real. This was all due to the documentary style of the film. On the drive home from the movie theater, I kept the overhead light in my car on and was constantly checking my backseat. Alfred Hitchcock's Strangers On a Train accomplishes this believability, but does so in a much different way. When we first meet Bruno on the train, I was immediately struck by how familiar the character was to me. I know people who behave just like him, minus all of the homicide and craziness. They are outgoing to the point of extreme annoyance. This familiarity made me immediately view the character more three dimensionally.When Bruno finally reveals his plan to Guy, I found myself thinking that it was a relatively good plan. By making both the antagonist and his scheme believable, I was locked in for the rest of the movie. Robert Walker does a tremendous job of playing the complex Bruno. He is anything but a one-note character. While he came across as somewhat silly at times, I found Bruno to be a pretty scary villain due to his unpredictability. Farley Granger's performance wasn't as strong to me, but he managed to hold his ground with Walker. Hitchcock does what he does best in this picture and creates suspense even in scenes where you think everything is fine. The most chilling scene in the entire movie to me occurred in broad daylight. Guy is in a car and looks out the window to see Bruno standing on a flight of stares far away, looking back at him. While this film isn't nearly as suspenseful as Psycho, I enjoyed it thoroughly and found myself on edge numerous times.</fullReview>

That said, the casting (and I agree with many on this site: it's Robert Walker's best performance (but really what else did he do?}, the photography, and the brilliant directing of this film can't compare to anything that is being done today. Hitch knew the grammar of film like few others. And this is course in film structure from "A to Z"-- and then some. Besides the ending is great.

		<fullReview>I read recently in a collection of interviews by Peter Bogdanovich that he was not happy with picking Farley Granger as the foil in "Strangers on a Train." I would agree. However, the character of Bruno is so dominant and Robert Walker so insidious, I don't think it matters. Like most Hitchcock films, it's the camera. His mind's eye. The use of the women with glasses.The overhead shots. The threatening shadows. The merry go round. The lighter that slips into the storm drain. Hitchcock even said that the old man that goes under the merry-go-round didn't realize that he actually was in grave danger. Had he raised up for a second, the thing would have taken his head off. Those scenes are vintage Hitchcock. I don't know if it is vintage Hitchcock, but it's better than about 95% of the movies being made today. The man who somehow finds himself in an untenable position through no fault of his own and then must find out enough about it so he can survive is the benchmark of many of the films. The weakest part of the movie is the relationship of Granger's character with the people he knows. Somehow, I never really felt the suspense.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>WaRnInG rEaDeRs: may contain spoilersMy 5 favorite funny moments of SOAT:1) The scene with Mrs. Cunningham and Bruno, with Mrs. Cunningham hysterical with laughter as she outlines a 'too specific' method of murdering her husband on a whim.2) The Eyebrow: Bruno takes the mallet from the man operating the carnival Feat of Strength attraction, and before he strikes the pad to send the bell to the top, he gives Miriam a very sly eyebrow. Watch it in slo-mo. Man, that's good.3) The old man at the merry-go-round: The P.I.'s are debating over how to stop the merry-go-round that has circled insanely out of control. The funny looking old man puts on a look of absolutely classic resolve and he looks toward the merry-go-round, balls his hands into fist, and prepares to tame the Beast.4) Also a product of the old man, the cross cuts of the spiralling Merry-go-Round of doom, and the old man crawling like a slug in slow-motion under the wreck. Classic.5) The jittery policeman firing off a random shot that kills a person. PLEASE, don't look at this as some sort of commentary on police brutality or senseless murder or any such nonsense. The take is about 2 seconds long! Its brevity is what killed me. Hitchcock's dark comedy was way ahead of its time and only modern filmmakers like Quentin Tarantino and the like are catching up. Look at the scene objectively. Bruno and Guy now at a healthy run, the jig is up, bust a cap, now onto the merry-go-round. Hitchcock didn't linger, you shouldn't either. Take its brevity to inform you of its humor.In summa: this movie is hilarious. Watch it as a comedy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Little Story of Murder</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alfred Hitchcock, one of the most influential director of movie's culture, back again in this small tale of psychotic man. After I watched some of his films, I just can grope what's next in every scene. Less tough-provoking, but there is always something new in his movies. That is the very point of great cinema, genuine idea in every aspect. From "Strangers on a Train" (1951), I just learn the more suspense it gets in this short-movie. It starts directly to the core of the story and spread to the each corner of its story. Of course, don't think it too much, it's a very entertaining movie indeed. Hitchcock knew, even until now on, how to bring such a splendid recreation in his intense way.The main problem is just a man with mental disorders, thanks to Robert Walker, he give his best act. So psycho, I mean from that era, he is like The Joker in The Dark Knight. It's to exaggerating though, but Bruno Antony just the pioneer of the next psycho as antagonist. Yes, it's the new-born idea from that age, when nuts man becomes the character of movie. Who can expect what's he's thinking and why he can think of it. Audience never knows and understands it, and that's the interesting point, especially in 1950's. Mix with some twists, the story nothing but good one. Hitchcock is really sharp when it comes to select the story I think. And he direct it with his very suspenseful talent, I admire it.In the other hand, the amusing yet interesting point is the discretion of the protagonist, Guy Haines. Very logical and careful, just like us, the audiences. The conflict is when normal man faces with mad man, and both of them is really smart. Nobody knows what's going to happened, I can feel it because I have seen other Hitchcock movies which is newer than this. I don't want to revealed the story, but that's very notable, in my opinion. The murder theory itself, for me it's ordinary, but again, in that era, those thoughts are genius. You know laws can grow without crime, and some of the criminals are inspired from the movie, or reverse. It's inspiring for police in that age, and laws for crazy man is reviewed for weird facts. Unfortunately, Hitchcock didn't hit this satire point, he point it out just in the murder case. I know this is his signature, very near to the amazing paradigm. It's okay, because he point other social dysfunction, intentionally or unintentionally. Which is the separation itself, and the life of wasted man. It's just the short part of the movie, but it gets so deep in Bruno's family. Another family's problem, even they are all established. Indeed, what a critical things for human.I give it eight out of ten, also because the cinematography and the dialog. The tennis part, is also the inspiration of sport-genre movie and the climax part is Hitchcock unforgettable scene. The style is so deep-rooted from the genius of each crew. But, after all, it's nice and one of Hitchcock's piece you should watch. Yeah, little story of cultural node.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Calls for some suspension of disbelief but pretty good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie is based on an interesting concept. The law cannot link a murderer to the murder he has committed if a motive cannot be established. Hence, if two strangers want to do away with someone in their lives, they can each commit the murder for the other. Robert Walker is brilliant as the scheming, conscienceless bad guy. He casts his shadow even on the scenes he is not present in and you never cease to wish him ill. Farley Granger is pretty good as the morally-upright gentleman who falls unwittingly into Walker's trap. His character may appear naive at times but that is the writing. Patricia Hitchcock is charming and brings some much needed cheer to the movie. Ruth Morton, Granger's love interest, is the weak link as she delivers a monotonous performance. Marion Lorne, thought she has only a couple of scenes, leaves a lasting impression as Walker's annoyingly over-indulgent mom.This movie is by no means flawless. In fact it is full of gaping plot holes and we can guess the ending because it was made the days of Hays Code. However, it is fast paced and does not give us time to linger on the low points for long. We are treated to some very good shots. (We see a murder as reflected on the shades fallen in the grass). The tension is heavy and the characters are believable. It will not hold up to a logical scrutiny but it is a good idea if you are looking for some light entertainment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Theatre is theatre, film film. Right? Actually not any more as the two mediums increasingly converge. And the bizarre fact about this production, although based on the 1949 Patricia Highsmith novel rather than the subsequent Hitchcock movie, is that it feels, for much of the evening, like a piece of film noir. This is theatre turning into cinema rather than borrowing from it. The evening begins with the image of an onrushing train. We then shift to a public compartment where Guy Haines has his fateful encounter with Charles Bruno. But everything about the first half suggests we are in for a night at the movies. We get multiple short scenes. Tim Goodchild's busily revolving set is shadowed by Peter Wilms's video projections so that we see the landscape through which the train is passing. To clinch matters, the sound design deliberately echoes the nerve-jangling scores that Bernard Herrmann wrote for Hitchcock. Craig Warner has written the script. It felt sometimes as if it was more the work of Warner Brothers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Inventive, well-paced Hitchcock story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>STRANGERS ON A TRAIN is an example of Hitchcock at his purest as well as his inventive best: it's a straightforward, suspense-laden thriller with an intriguing premise, some engaging development and a wonderfully executed payoff. Raymond Chandler's work on the screenplay adds a grittily realistic spin on what could have been, in other hands, an overly artificial thriller, but in these hands it's one of the director's best.The story is simplicity in itself: Farley Granger, so good as the killer in ROPE, is another of Hitch's "wronged man" heroes, really put through the wringer by the throes of the screenplay; Robert Walker bags the best role of his career as a pitch-perfect deranged bad guy who might well be the finest of Hitch's villains, at least until Anthony Perkins came along later. I particularly liked the presence of Patricia Hitchcock in a blackly comic supporting role, along with turns for veterans like Leo G. Carroll.The movie slow-builds its storyline at a gradual pace, building tension upon tension, incident upon incident, until finally reaching breaking point in which Hitch directs a tennis match. Imagine what he could have done with Wimbledon! It gets ever better after that, with the fun fair climax which is one of my favourite sequences in the director's filmography, a truly outlandish set-piece which has it all: suspense, death, danger, a hard-bitten fight scene, incompetent policemen and a rousing score to top it all of. It's a great way to end a great little movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The perfect crime. Many have dreamed about it and would do it if they thought they could get away with it. Bruno (Robert Walker) recognizes Guy (Farley Granger) on a train and proposes the perfect crime. It would have worked, had Bruno made sure that Guy was in agreement.One thing that you recognize immediately is that Hitchcock made splendid casting choices here. Walker and Granger were perfect for the roles. Bruno was definitely gay, even if you couldn't state it in 1951. He wasn't an effeminate gay, however, as he showed at the fair when tracking Guy's wife, the cheating Miriam (Kasey Rogers). I fact Guy seemed to be the effeminate one, weak and indecisive, but he was definitely straight, as he wanted to get rid of his wife to marry the Senator's (Leo G. Carroll) daughter Anne (Ruth Roman).Bruno kept following Guy, and almost gave himself away when he met Anne's sister, played by Patricia Hitchcock, Alfred's real daughter, who bore a striking resemblance to Miriam. Anne was becoming increasingly suspicious.Forced to tell all to Anne what was going on, Guy enlists her and her sister's help in trying to clear himself. The police are right on his tail as the excitement ratchets up tremendously.A great finale and a bit of a surprise.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Strangers on a Train is one of those magical experiences in cinema where every moment works; and only small quibbles can be made even sixty one years after it was released. Visually, it is magnificent. The depth of precision that Hitchcock achieves makes watching it a singularly pleasurable experience. I've seen it now at least ten times; each new time I see it I wish it was the first viewing all over again.Robert Walker is particularly mesmerizing as the (implied) gay psychopath, Bruno Antony. (In real-life he was heterosexual. Farley Granger, in real life a homosexual, plays the straight tennis player Guy Haines who gets drawn into Bruno's murder-swapping scheme.) Patricia Hitchcock is another standout. Her father gave her a delicious role; and she steals scenes with glee.Strangers on a Train is so solid that criticism of it seems unjustified. We certainly don't want to object to one character's bizarre idea late in the film of asking nearby people to assist in recovering the same cigarette lighter he expects will cast irrefutable guilt on the other character. Hitchcock's films all have plot weaknesses (a.k.a., "MacGuffins") built-in and he needs the audience to suspend disbelief.However, I cringe as the tennis scenes unfold. First, the over-the-top announcer speaks as if neither he nor anyone in the audience has ever watched a tennis match before. ("Guy Haines has a two-set lead and if he wins another, it will be a straight-set win for sure." Oh, really? Is that what a three-set match means?) The two players also appear to play a let serve, which is a blooper.There's also Hitchcock's repetition of a player nearly facing us and hitting what appears to be a serve or overhead for a winner. A real elite tennis player wouldn't be hitting that shot with his stomach directly facing the viewer. Also, 1950s tennis didn't have that many service winners--and they wouldn't be hitting so many overheads from such a similar and comfortable position.(BTW, I've read other user reviews and many writers have said that Haines is a tennis pro. Wrong. He's an amateur. There's a subtle distinction which I think is worth bringing up because of how it helps define what Guy Haines is about.) Quibbles aside, I wonder what it would be like if Hitchock had convinced William Holden to play Guy Haines. Granger looks more like a tennis player than Holden, and seems more believably manipulated by Bruno than perhaps Holden would have been. On the other hand, there would have been a more uncertain feeling if Holden as Haines had paid that evening call on a stranger.Strangers on a Train is a perennial pleasure. If it is playing anywhere close by go see it again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One Of Hitchcock's Most Underrated Films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Strangers on a Train is an psychological thriller film produced and directed by Alfred Hitchcock.It was based on the novel of the same title by Patricia Highsmith. The film stars Farley Granger, Ruth Roman, and Robert Walker together with Leo G. Carroll, Patricia Hitchcock, and Laura Elliott.This perfectly exemplifies Hitchcock's favorite theme of the evil that lurks just below the surface of everyday life and ordinary men.Tennis pro Guy Haines chances to meet wealthy wastrel Bruno Anthony on a train. Having read all about Guy, Bruno is aware that the tennis player is trapped in an unhappy marriage to to wife Miriam and has been seen in the company of senator's daughter Ann Morton. Baiting Guy, Bruno reveals that he feels trapped by his hated father. As Guy listens with detached amusement, Bruno discusses the theory of "exchange murders." Suppose that Bruno were to murder Guy's wife, and Guy in exchange were to kill Bruno's father? With no known link between the two men, the police would be none the wiser, would they? When he reaches his destination, Guy bids goodbye to Bruno, thinking nothing more of the affable but rather curious young man's homicidal theories. And then, Guy's wife turns up strangled to death. Given a good basis for a thriller in the Patricia Highsmith novel and a first-rate script, Hitchcock embroiders the plot into a gripping, palm- sweating piece of suspense.This intriguing film deals with all the auteur's issues, including the double motif, moral ambiguity, fine line between hero and villain.In addition to that,it is an expertly made thriller with fluid camera work, dark humor and enough cliff-hanging build up to keep you biting your nails until there's nothing left. Easily one of Hitchcock's most underrated films.</fullReview>

Walker takes it upon himself to kill Granger's wife and then expects Granger to kill his father.The plot is engrossing in that Walker begins to affect Granger's life and those around him. Granger can't go to the police. Who would believe him? He'd be charged as an accessory to the crime. The merry-go-round ending is marvelously staged and Granger will not be left off the hook until the last minute.The entire cast is great. Marion Lorne, the comedienne on the Carol Burnett show years later, is interesting. In a dramatic way, she displays her flustering that she'd do years later on the latter comedy show in an interesting way.Ruth Roman is very good as Granger's girlfriend caught up in this scheme, as well as Patricia Hitchcock, Roman's sister, acting as a sleuth here.A memorable film, riveting all the way.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This might actually be my favorite Hitchcockian thriller ever. With its utmost realistic and thought-provoking story Hitchcock wanted to show the world that even some of the regular folks have their moments of sheer evil. When given a chance, they're able to construct a plan so diabolical in its simplicity, that its execution may be only a matter of time and a matter of blackmailing and ferocious persuasive skills.With its drastically spellbinding noir atmosphere, and a mood so tense that it's almost distressing, Strangers on a Train shows a story so unusual, yet, surprisingly, so believable in its deep horror that it makes the viewer contemplate about its purpose and how he/she would react, drawn into a deadly intrigue of the most horrible kind. Farley Granger is stupendous as the loathsome, but perfectly adequate man, whose murderous plan seems to give him so much fun. Robert Walker is likewise as convincing as Granger in his depiction of a helpless young guy, who is unwittingly placed in a bizarre and shocking situation, without even a chance of turning back. With is well-written script, beautiful and rich visuals, memorable scenes (the killing and close-up of the glasses), and Hitchcock's most precise direction, Stranger on a Train marks another milestone in the Master's career.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In modern films, the art of susupense seems to be lost in simple minded gore and violence. This leads to a film experience that is not completely satisfying, and is sometimes just hard to sit through. Thankfully, this standard for directing has not always been so bleak, and Alfred Hitchcock's Strangers on a Train is a perfect sentiment to that. Although the film contains hardly any violence, audiences are kept on the edge of their seat, by Hitchcock's deep and well planned plots and intoxicating characters. Bruno is the character that really brings the aspects of suspense to this film, and does so flawlessly. He is incredibly confident and charismatic all of the time, and is successful in bending people to his will. He is also always one step ahead of all of Guy's plans. This is made horribly obvious when he flips on the light in his father's bedroom, when Guy attempts to make his father aware of Bruno's true character. The idea of a man with these elements stalking you, is a frightening one. Add to that the fact that he has committed a murder on your behalf, and is ready to frame you if you don't hold up your part of the bargain, and the result is a plot that is simply inresistable. Bruno, along with the other characters in the film are some of the greatest to grace the silver screen with their presence, and come together to create one of the greatest suspense films ever created.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Will the perfect murder work this time around?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"What is a life or two, Guy? Some people are better off dead. Well, like your wife and my father, for instance."It's the perfect murder. Two strangers meet, and each kill off the victim of the other. There's no motive linking the killer to the crime, so theoretically the police would never have a reason to suspect what actually happened. Of course, even the perfect plan can fail when one of the participants has no intention of actually going through with the crime, and the other is mentally disturbed.We've seen Hitchcock tackle "the perfect murder" before in Dial M for Murder, and it's no real surprise that both movies deal with the disastrous results of a crime that turns out to be not nearly so perfect. I also ended up liking both movies to about the same degree.Strangers on a Train does one thing extremely well, and that's suspense. It may be one of the most suspenseful Hitchcock movies that I've seen, and that's saying something. But unlike my favorite Hitchcock movies, it doesn't have much to offer beyond that near- constant tension. I didn't find the characters particularly interesting, and the story didn't do much for me. The merry-go-round scene at the end was incredibly impressive, but it probably will be quite a while before I revisit this one. With that said, an average Hitchcock movie is still worth seeing at least once.&nbsp;</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Inspired casting in classic Hitchcock</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Strangers on a Train" features some of the most inspired casting of any Hitchcock movie.Robert Walker was quite close to a nervous breakdown during the making of this film. Reportedly, Hitchcock was aware of the actor's instability and found Walker perfect for the role of the demented Bruno Antony.Completing this odd couple is the good looking, well-mannered Farley Granger, as tennis pro Guy Haines. Talk about opposites attracting, Granger, who was gay in real life, is the antithesis of the Antony character. Soft spoken and a tad light in his loafers, his Guy Haines mistakenly concludes that Bruno is just a neurotic, rich kid. It's too late before he realizes that Bruno is a sociopathic murderer.This is easily one of Hitchcock's finest films. Hitchcock's failed experiment "Rope" tried to bring the Loeb and Leopold story to the screen. But this film succeeds as HItchcock's own Loeb and Leopold story.There are many fine moments in this film. Bruno entering the "Tunnel of Love" on a boat named "Pluto" (god of the underworld). Bruno casually popping a child's balloon with a cigarette. Marion Lorne, playing Bruno's silly, doting mother, showing her son her latest painting, a gruesome abstract which she calls "St. Francis". Bruno starts laughing upon seeing it, mistaking it for a portrait of his father.The murder scene of Miriam is classic Hitchcock. Murder as art would be encapsulated forever in the classic shower scene of "Psycho". This murder in "Strangers on a Train" may be even better, as it is subtly portrayed through the distorted image of the murdered woman's glasses.Walker as Bruno is easily one of Hitchcock's darkest villains. HItchcock had a dark side. How many film directors would take advantage of an actor's mental problems?Hitchcock would and did, and pulled off one of his finest films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Treat Two Impostors Just the Same</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Handsome tennis pro Farley Granger (as Guy Haines) meets psychotic Robert Walker (as Bruno Anthony) on a train, and suggests the two men, being strangers, could get away with exchanging murders. Since he reads the society page gossip on Mr. Granger, Mr. Walker knows the tennis star is having trouble obtaining a divorce from his wife. So, Walker proposes Granger murder his hated father, after taking care of Walker's wife. Granger thinks Walker's idea is crazy? From the superb opening train ride - witness the symbolic electricity with which Granger "knocks feet" with Walker - to the pulse-pounding "Merry-Go-Round" climax, this is one incredible trip. "Strangers on a Train" must be grouped with director Alfred Hitchcock's very best films. And, with so many of his themes represented, it could be - if any one film could be described as such - the perfect Hitchcock picture. Or, at least, it's the first perfect culmination of themes.The director's famed touches are masterfully woven throughout, from the voyeurism of those watching Granger argue with his bespectacled, pregnant wife (by another man, no less) - to the homo-orgasmic final confrontation between passively athletic Granger and charismatically psycho Walker (those steel rods really move). Hitchcock, the perfectly cast male duo, Robert Burks' photography, and motherly Marion Lorne are at "Perfect Ten" performance levels.********** Strangers on a Train (6/30/51) Alfred Hitchcock ~ Farley Granger, Robert Walker, Ruth Roman, Marion Lorne</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Swapping murders.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Only someone as educated in the art of suspense as Alfred Hitchcock could make such a simple story so compelling. Two strangers meet on a train. Guy Haines (Farley Granger) is a tennis player in love with a senator's daughter (Ruth Roman as Anne Morton) and in the middle of a divorce with his promiscuous wife. Bruno Anthony (Robert Walker) is a spoiled, wealthy young man who hates his overbearing father. He's also psychotic and tells Guy about his plan for the perfect murder. Two people meet by chance, both of them with someone they want to kill. But in order to avoid any motive, they swap murders. Bruno tells him that he'll kill Guy's wife, and then Guy can murder Bruno's father.Guy laughs it off and gets off the train, going straight into an argument with his wife. Little does he know that Bruno was deadly serious, and when Guy's wife turns up dead everything gets a lot more suspenseful. Hitchcock imbues the entire film with an incredibly ominous, eerie feeling with the help of shots of Bruno in the distance, silently watching Guy, waiting for him to return the favor of murder. To go into any more detail on the story would spoil it, but it's a chilling tale with some fine performances to boot. Another masterwork from the master of suspense.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm making my way through all of Hitchcock's films this year and it seems that with every film of his I see, I have a new favorite movie. This one was amazing in every way possible. I was in suspense the entire time and it didn't let up until the very end. We all know that Hitchcock is the master of suspense but it always amazes me how many times he was able to pull it off. Strangers on a Train is no exception.The story is brilliant. A famous tennis player meets a man on a train who wants to swap murders, and is plunged into a nightmare. Farley Granger is awesome, I was glad to see him doing another Hitchcock film as he was great in Rope. Robert Walker and everyone else are also fantastic in this film. I also thought that the climax was one of the most intense I've ever seen. You won't want to look away.I don't see any reason as to why anyone shouldn't see this movie. Especially if you love Hitchcock.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Suspenseful Hitchcock Thriller From Patricia Highsmith Crime Fiction Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Guy Haines is a tennis-player whose philandering wife won't grant him a divorce. Bruno Antony is an idle rich psychopath who wants to kill his father. The two meet by chance on a train journey, wherein Antony hatches a mad plan; he will kill Haines' wife and Haines will kill Antony's father. Haines thinks he's a harmless fool and humours him but Antony is deadly serious and kills Mrs Haines. Guy must somehow clear his name with the police and expose Antony as the real killer.Patricia Highsmith's superb first novel is a brilliant idea - two unconnected men swap murders so that neither has a possible motive for their crime - which fits in perfectly with Hitchcock's classic double-hunt structure - the hero must hunt the killer while the authorities hunt him. This is the recipe that makes this movie so enjoyable - watching the cool and sophisticated Granger squirming as he tries desperately to extricate himself from a mess that isn't of his making. The script itself (by Raymond Chandler &amp; Czenzi Ormonde) is workmanlike, but what really interests Hitchcock is racking up the tension in several memorable sequences - the lengthy, wordless stalking in the amusement park leading up to the murder, flashy crosscutting between Granger winning a tennis-match and Walker trying desperately to retrieve a cigarette-lighter dropped down a drain, and the astounding exploding-carousel finale. If the movie has one let-down it's in the slightly stilted heroic performances by Granger and Roman. Walker on the other hand gives the performance of a lifetime as one of Hitchcock's classic Oedipal psychos; effeminately pawing Guy one minute and hard-as-nails strangler the next. The film has a beautiful string score by Dimitri Tiomkin and is very handsomely shot (Hitch's first of twelve films with the great Robert Burks). A classic film of a classic crime novel.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a disappointment (MAJOR SPOILERS!!!)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After reading the book, I went out of my way to rent this film since I thought the novel was so good in its buildup of suspense and paranoia. I was looking forward to how Hitchock would do that in film. But he doesn't. He changes it into a much more conventional crazy-psycho versus normal-nice-guy plot, and ruins the ending. Aside from the directorial touches (how about the scene where Guy is playing tennis and the whole audience is watching the match with their heads going back and forth following the ball, except for Bruno who's staring fixedly at Guy...) this is just a trite novel. Guy is not conflicted at all, he's just an innocent victim of a nut job, and the silly chase sequence and merry-go-round ending is incredibly trite and unsatisfying.I would recommend that anyone who saw or liked this film read the novel; it is vastly better than the movie. I won't offer any spoilers about the book, but suffice it to say it's much more suspenseful and the characters are more complex.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Impressed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wasn't all that impressed by the Hollywood version of Strangers on a Train. Admittedly, there were moments of brilliance (the tennis scenes and the opening scene were both flawless) and Chandler's screenplay was witty and clever. But Farely Granger (who I see as a 1950s equivalent to Keanu Reeves) did not hold his own against the formidable Robert Walker, whose performance in Strangers is on par only with Robert Mitchum in Night of the Hunter.Maybe I'm not a Hitchcock fan, but I thought that the ending was cheap and unrealistic, the kind of mush that infects nearly every Hollywood thriller nowadays. Some of the motifs and image systems were interesting but this clearly isn't a film with any technical ambition. There's no doubt that Strangers is a classic, but between Granger's sub-par performance and the over-the-top ending I'm inclined to give this film a B.The Third Man - Carol Reed's brilliant thriller made only a few years earlier - differs in plot but is head-and-shoulders over Strangers and offers great acting (Welles and Cotton) to boot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Is okay, not great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SpoilersWatching `Strangers on a Train' for Robert Walker's performance is a hell of a lot easier and more rewarding than watching `Secret Agent' or the first `Man Who Knew too Much' for the scenes with Peter Lorre.Strangers is almost a good Hitchcock film in spots. Robert Walker is almost impossibly good - a perfect combination of menace, charm, and anarchic energy. Walker's dark hints and endless enthusiasm for murder propel the scenes he's in. The scene with his mother and the disaster when he crashes the Senator's party are so good that pretty much all the other characters are colorless and boring.I know this is part of the design - that Guy is doing his level best to set up a boring, ordered life that's above reproach. He's ditching one of the only other colorful characters in the film (Miriam,) marrying the boss's daughter and intends to retire from sport to pursue politics. Bruno's lifestyle of precarious idleness, weird family and utter disregard for appearances are supposed to upstage Guy, but I was actually really bored when Walker wasn't on the screen. Ruth Roman spends the whole film looking concerned about information she's digesting. I kept wanting to stop the film and check the IMDB to see if Patricia Hitchcock played the same character in `Shadow of a Doubt.' (nope, it was Edna May Walcott) The cops were so generic that I was baffled why Hitchcock bothered giving them names. And *yawn* Farley Granger?The movie is beautifully shot in spots - the murder in the lens, Bruno's lank shadowlike presence, Bruno emerging from the dark when he flips on the light, Guy self-consciously stepping behind bars, the bizarre merry-go-round and so on. The dialogue, particularly Bruno's opaque staccato probing, is excellent sometimes. The plot is only held together passably well. It sorta kinda almost makes sense that Guy wouldn't go to the cops - he's obsessed with appearances and all. When Bruno makes it completely clear at the party that he's not exactly the sort of conspirator you can really count on to keep his mouth shut, Guy finally does commit to doing SOMETHING about his situation. The last half of the movie tends to drag because the plot is so thin (and it's a pretty short film). The parallels between the strangers never really stands up cuz Granger's plot is so thoroughly overshadowed that I forgot about him.It's not Hitchcock's worst film, but it's way way down the list. It's really worth catching for Robert Walker.</fullReview>

In America, the ending was comical, while in England, it was a classic dramatic ending.Both do justice to the story but only one does justice to the genius of Hitchcock. The funny ending is a symbol of Hitchcock's love to mess with the audience. Suspense to Comedy to Suspense and back to comedy, the audience doesn't know how to react. It's a pure thriller.

		<shortDescription>Before he was the Master of Suspense...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>...Alfred Hitchcock was the "Master of needlessly dragging stuff out".The plot we all know. A couple of strangers meet on a train and talk about exchanging murders.The reality of the film is that one person never agrees to commit a murder, has a murder foisted upon him, and tries everything to not commit that murder while under suspicion for the murder someone else committed.The best performance in this movie is Robert Walker as a completely crazy, somewhat effeminate person who murders a woman to get the hero to murder his father. He was Norman Bates before there was a Norman Bates.Now, getting back to my original observation, you have the drawn out tennis scene played against Walker's character trying to get a lighter out of a storm drain. These scenes are dragged out, but they aren't the suspenseful scenes that Hitch was later known for. The final scene involves a fight on a merry-go-round that they simply didn't have the technical expertise to film in 1951.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Black comedy at its finest</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In my mind, Alfred Hitchcock is known for one thing. No, it's not his suspenseful technique, his gripping stories or even his magnificent eye. It's his characteristic sense of humour.Here in this early film of his, we see that witty comedic spirit come out in full glory. Yes, this is a suspenseful tale, but even more than that, it's a fun, dark comedy where the characters are so wonderfully bizarre you have to laugh in almost every scene.Each &amp; every character is certifiably insane. The antagonist is one of the most original killers I've ever seen with his stylish, flamboyant, devil-may-care attitude (which, on a dime, can turn into obsessive mania). His intended victim is a super slutty housewife whose suggestive antics (licking that ice cream cone...) will have you rolling in the aisles. Then there are a bunch of demure old ladies who suddenly start giggling at the prospect of bludgeoning &amp; burning their husbands alive. And even the straight-laced protagonist is so *extremely* normal you'd think there's gotta be something very wrong with his head. But to me, the character who steals the show is the young girl Barbara (played by Hitchcock's daughter) who is the hilarious Hitchcockian equivalent of a Shakespearean fool: the brutally honest character who tells it like it is, exposing the sordid truth, but nobody really pays attention.Throw in a host of sideshow freaks (like the mother who is played by "Aunt Clara" from Bewitched in the same exact role), and you have a 100% madcap comedy on your hands. Even though it's about a sequence of chilling murders. Who could pull it off in the 1950s? Only Al Hitchcock. Today, directors are more at liberty to take a cavalier attitudes toward murder, mayhem &amp; carnage. But you have to realize that Hitch was really one of the first to break new ground. I really think this may have been one of the earliest black comedies to hit the screen, back when comedies were always light-hearted, and thrillers were always deadly serious.Go out &amp; see this movie on the big screen if you can (it sometimes pops up in film festivals which is where I saw it recently). Right down to the carnival scene with the merry-go-round spinning at 100 mph, this movie is a fun, wild ride! Highly recommended for both Hitchcock aficionados as well as those who have never seen a Hitchcock movie in their lives.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A black and white film, not a black and white world</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alfred Hitchcock is one of the greatest directors all of time, and his films never die out not even one more century passes. "Strangers on a train" is one of those movies that still remain very remarkable nowadays. Thus, I always forget what's the age of his film while I watch it, and the dressing of the characters might be the only clue left for me to speculate.Although this is a black and white film, there is no bothering to understand and appreciate the whole story. Meanwhile, I am obsessed with this paranoid character Bruno, who became Guy's nightmare ever since they met on a train. In the beginning, Guy was being polite to listen to his conspiracy to switch murders regarding killing people stand in their way. Not soon after Guy failed to divorce his wife, he actually think about Bruno's idea, but he never let that thought went deeper. However, crazy as Bruno was, he finished his job without hesitating, and it was time for Guy to do the same for him. As we can see, Guy was in a dilemma which he never actually did something to make him jump into such a difficult condition, in other words, he was completely innocent.Misunderstanding is one of Hitchcock's favorite issues, for that given such harsh circumstances, people tends to bring their best or worst toward their problems. In the case, we saw the dignity of Guy and his unwilling to compromise with Bruno. Furthermore, the narrative methods of the movie made the audiences so nervous till the end, because the possibility for all of us to witness the danger and mistake that might happen to such a honorable person. Fortunately, the owner of the merry-go-round remembered everything, and destroyed the plan of Bruno to plant his murder on Guy. Most important of all, the scene at the merry-go-round was so thrilling which made the climax of the movie, thanks to the brilliant skills Hitchcock had demonstrated.The film not only elaborates on humanity which is not just about right versus wrong, but also brings out different possibilities in human nature. That is to say, this is not a black and white world we live, so we absolutely cannot expect things to be that way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Visual perfection</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alfred Hitchcock the master of suspense brought us a thriller, originally written by the famous film-noir writer Raymond Chandler. But actually the screenplay was mostly written by Czenzi Ormonde, because Hitchcock and Chandler's teamwork just didn't work out.I just saw this today in theaters I had already seen it a few times on TV, and now that I've seen it on the big screen I love it even more. The movie is geographically perfect. From the beginning you see two pair of shoes walking towards the train, crossroads in the railway, all of this leads to the leading theme of the movie: partnership. This introduction is one of the finest ones I've ever seen. I can only recall two names who have achieved true geographically visual perfection, Alfred Hitchcock and Robert Bresson.In the beginning of the movie, in the train we see shadows on Bruno's face - a mark of guilty. After this scene the next time when Bruno and Guy meet we also see some stripes of shadows on Guy's face. Guiltiness catches. Visual perfection is what this movie is from the very first scene to the last one.The movie is also some sort of a survey of homosexuality. But you have to pay attention to see it. The homosexuality is captured in Bruno's eyes, characteristics and in small gestures. But it's understandable in consideration of the era Strangers on a Train was made. Hitchcock also dealt with the subject in his earlier film Rope (1948), where Farley Granger played a gay-role as well.Hitchcock's daughter Patricia Hitchcock's performance is also marvelous. She gives a great life to her character Barbara. Patricia also played a role in Hitchcock's Psycho, and had a few roles in the TV-series Alfred Hitchcock Presents.I can't describe the feeling that I had when I saw the film in theaters. But watching this on DVD will do just fine too. In my opinion this is Hitchcock's best film from his Hollywood era. Highly recommended - Visually perfect.10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Strangers on a Train on Reel 13</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While STRANGERS ON A TRAIN, which aired on Reel 13 this past Saturday, generally isn't considered amongst Hitchcock's upper echelon of films (VERTIGO, PSYCHO, NORTH BY NORTHWEST, THE BIRDS), it's still an effective and entertaining work of cinema with several sequences that remind us why Hitch is such a master of his craft.One only needs to watch the opening sequence, which we used to study in film school ad nauseum, to get a sense of what I mean. Hitchcock opens the movie by following the shoes of the two main characters as they arrive at the train station and make their way toward their inevitable meeting on the train. It's brilliant because of its simplicity and also how it affects multiple things at once. It offers mystery by not showing us faces, but through the design of the shoes and the nature of each character's stride, we immediately get a general sense of who each of them are without a word of dialogue spoken. It's truly visual storytelling at its best.Another example of Hitchcock at his best is the first carnival sequence in which Bruno stalks Miriam from ride to ride. In his interview with Francois Truffaut, Hitchcock explained that suspense happens when the audience knows something the character's don't. It seems so simple when you think about it, but his vocalization of it has stuck with me for a decade. This carnival scene is a prime example that he practiced what he preached and understood the concept thoroughly. The sequence is intense because you know that at some point, Bruno is going to pounce, but you don't know when, where or how. Hitchcock takes advantage of this and tortures you on ride after ride, carnival booth after carnival booth, until you have bitten your nails down to the nub. Also, the gaiety of the carnival of the background is a great counterpoint for the menace in the air. Hitchcock was always great at combining elements like this.Another staple of Hitchcock, however, even in his best work, is some moments of unfortunate implausibility that are usually forgiven given the high quality of the rest of the film. In STRANGERS ON A TRAIN, the weakest link is the casting, marked mostly by the casting of his own daughter in a major supporting role. The leads, who are least professionals, don't fare much better, though. Farley Granger is stiff and uninteresting as the two-dimensional Guy Haines while Robert Walker has the opposite issue as Bruno. He overplays his hand severely time and time again and never manages to scare anybody when he speaks. It's only when Hitchcock shuts him up does he ever seem threatening.Additionally, there are major contrivances within the plot that Hitchcock doesn't bother to try and soften. Even the very premise is a hard pill to swallow ? given Bruno's behavior on the train, it's hard to believe that straight-laced Guy would have put up with him as much as he does. Also, the way that character that wear eyeglasses factor into the mystery is a bit of a reach. And the moment when Bruno becomes Elastic-Man to rescue a key piece of evidence is eyeroll-inducing.Despite all these hiccups, there's no question that STRANGERS ON A TRAIN delivers the goods. As a matter of fact, Hitchcock is a perfect match with Patricia Highsmith who penned the novel on which the film is based ? the same way fellow countryman David Lean was a great match with Dickens in last week's GREAT EXPECTATIONS. And in both films, you see each master playing with ideas and techniques that they will utilize to much greater effect in subsequent films.(For more information on this or any other Reel 13 film, check out their website at www.reel13.org)</fullReview>

It was actually very excited to watch a film on a more technical level and really paying close attention to Hitchcock's individual style. I loved the ending when Bruno drops the lighter down the grate and the scene keeps switching back and forth from the tennis match and to Bruno's hand coming closer and closer to the lighter, I found myself becoming more and more anxious the longer it went on. I also thought the way in which the murder scene was shot was very clever. I love that Hitchcock gets his main characters in such compromising positions that leave me wondering, how the hell is he gonna get out of this one? some may say Hitchcock films don't stand the test of time, but I find that quite humorous when you relies how many great directors have been and still are influenced by his work, like Steven Spielberg and Martin Scorsese just to name a few.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One Of The Most Fascinating, Enduring, Intelligent and Vastly Entertaining Thrillers Ever Made. Hitchcock's Finest Outing In Perfection</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is a certain trend that goes along with a Hitchcock plot; which usually involves the everyday man, who by chance becomes connected with a major dilemma. This is one of the many Hitchcock tendencies and remains one the primary example of one of the most difficult aspects in storytelling. You see, Hitchcock makes fiction relatable and even more importantly he puts the realism into his wonderfully absurd fiction. This is certainly not the easiest of tasks, considering it involves creating absorbing and mesmerising characters. Oddly, Hitchcock makes even the "bad guys" charming or darkly comic throughout his films.The infamously elegant and charismatic opening of Strangers on a Train captures the two protagonists of the film, slyly hinting on chance and coincidence. The story follows a wealthy tennis player named Guy Haines who is faced with the problem of divorcing his "money-grabbing" wife who has been having an affair. Yet he can't divorce her to due to her persistence of delaying the divorce due to her annoying nature. While on the train to Washington he meets an eccentric tennis fan, named Bruno Anthony, who recognises him automatically as the tennis star. Bruno quickly strikes you as more than just eccentric when he starts to suggest that he will kill the tennis player's wife so that Guy can marry his new love, while in return Guy has to kill Bruno's father. obviously considers it one far-fetched joke, while the eccentric Bruno Anthony sticks by what he says. Havoc ensures.The wide variety of cinematography and "Hitchockian" suspense clearly defines perfection. It has everything that a film needs, containing tracking shots and dizzying camera angles. The magnificently unique camera shots are reminiscent as a reminder of how influential the film has been. The noir direction and subtleties in lighting creates some of the most unsurpassed elements of film-making. The camera fixates the viewer towards the characters are draws you inside the wonderfully frenzied narrative. There is a superb use of closed-ups and low shots that creating an intimidating and fearful environment. The use of the built-up, bewildering score slides into the film's infrastructure with ease.Strangers on a Train is a film that has so many wonderfully layered, even and multi-dimensional characters that it holds a re-watch value unlike no other. The characters are exceedingly written; the underlying theme with the homo-erotic subtext (hinted more obviously in the British cut) of Bruno Anthony is something that is subtle and hugely interesting to study. The actors have all been remarkably cast into the most perfect of fitting roles.Shockingly, Strangers on a Train remains a Hitchcock that is rarely mentioned and so I consider it severely underrated, yet it is easily the finest work from the Master of Suspense. Strangers on a Train is cinematic perfection, certainly a film for a top twenty as it remains a one of the most thoughtful and delightful thrillers of cinema history.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beware of Strangers on a Train</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*SPOILERS On A Train* Guy Haines (Farley Granger) is a top tennis player, rich and successful, with a beautiful (but prone to cry and slow-thinker) girlfriend, Anne (Ruth Roman), a Senator (Leo G. Carroll) 's older daughter, and preparing to get into politics.He only has one problem - his slut, bitch of a wife Miriam (Laura Miller), who after a YEAR of wanting a divorce, 'suddenly' changes her mind - because she is pregnant by a man who did the right thing, drop her like a hot potato and run as far away from her as possible.While on the train to Metcalfe (where the 'woman' lives) Guy is approached by the charming-yet-repulsive Bruno Antony (Robert Walker), a sociopath in each and every sense of the word, who chats with him, and explains him a theory about 'swapping crimes' like criss-cross in order to commit the perfect murder. Bruno says that he'll murder Miriam if Guy'll murder his dad, whom he loathes from the deepest recesses of his soul.Guy dismisses all this chat as fooling around, and thinks Bruno's just a funny guy; but when Miriam is strangled while at an amusement park (which he finds out from Bruno), Guy understands the insanity that lies under that smooth façade, and finds out that Bruno has an almost homosexual obsession with him.In the meanwhile, the police suspects Guy of the murder, and the only element that could disculp him is a lighter with 'From A To G' written on it, which has been forgotten by Guy in Bruno's cabin the first time they met.Barbara (Patricia Hitchcock), Anne's witty sister (with a mouth that in 1951 was akin to a movie sailor's one - unforgettable her definition of Miriam 'She was a tramp!') and Anne herself (whoops, she's not there just as the token girlfriend, after all) zero in on Bruno as the killer, too, and help Guy try and get back to Metcalfe to prove, once and for all, that he did not murder Miriam.But will he succeed? One of Hitchcock's most brilliant, nail-biting suspense movies, with an amazing portray of a deeply disturbed individual (Bruno), especially for the early '50s.Absolutely not to be missed! Strangers On A Train: 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Robert Walker is a Psycho</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Two men meet on a train. One is a tennis star (Farley Granger); the other is a wealthy slacker (Robert Walker). Walker knows everything about Granger, including his divorce plans and his upcoming marriage to a senator's daughter (Ruth Roman). As they travel Walker smugly tells Granger about his "perfect murder" plan: you do my murder (his father), and I do yours.A few days later Granger is shocked to discover that his wife (Laura Elliott) has indeed been killed and that Walker keeps trying to contact him to plan the father's demise.Excellent Alfred Hitchcock film from the Patricia Highsmith novel is filled with the master's touches and boasts a great cinematic finale in the runaway carousel.Granger and Walker are very good, but Roman has little to do. Elliott, who later changer her name to Kasey Rogers, is deliciously evil as the wife. Patricia Hitchcock is also fun as Roman's younger sister. Leo G. Carroll is the senator. Marion Lorne is hilarious as Walker's mother. Norma Varden is the party lady who gets "strangled." Robert Gist is Hennessy, John Brown is the drunk professor. Harry Hines is the old man who crawls under the carousel. Jonathan Hale is Walker's father. Odette Myrtil is Mrs. Darville.Great film.....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Grade: B+</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An altogether average Hitchcock movie (which, admittedly, makes it better than almost any thriller made nowadays), notable for two reasons.First, there's Robert Walker's subtle, brilliant performance as Bruno Anthony. This was a stylistically very different performance from what audiences were used to seeing in the early fifties. It was less stagey, more fluid. Even the way he walked was quiet and smooth. What's even more fascinating is Walker's choice to make Bruno a not-so-closeted homosexual with a sexual obsession with Guy Haines, played by the very dull Farley Granger. Bruno's stalking of Guy isn't about murder; it's about sex. Walker telegraphs this with body language and facial expressions, because the Hays Code never would have allowed such a concept to be put to screen at the time, and the result is a marvelous sort of chemistry to the relationship between the two men.The second reason to rent it is the final sequence on the carousel, which is pure Hitchcock. Bruno and Guy pummeling one another, a child in jeopardy, a carnival ride spinning out of control, shouts of joy turning to terrified shrieks. The shots of the carousel horses' faces, mouths ghoulishly leering open, madness in their eyes, are particularly effective here. And never have I seen the outcome of a non-sports related film depend so much on the outcome of a sporting event.A really great movie. Not the best of Hitch's career, but certainly worth your time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic Hitchcock Thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sadly, 'Strangers' is often overlooked when classic Hitchcock films (Rear Window, Vertigo, etc.)are mentioned. People often see 'Rear Window' as the first of the classic Hitchcock films that began with Rear Window (1954) and ended with The Birds (1963). While both films, and all in between were truly great movies that come to mind first when the topic is raised, Strangers on a Train should be included with them as well. It truly is a polished thriller in the grand Hitchcock tradition.A famous tennis player (Guy Haynes) with a serious marital problem gains a clinging 'friend' in the character of Bruno, a man who introduces himself into Guy's life when they meet on a train. He brings up the topic of murder, and how he'd like his father knocked off. He knows that Guy's wife is a terminal bitch who won't agree to a divorce and sees an opportunity to get both murders done without getting caught. Simple - switch murders! If each murder is done by the other man, a random, unconnected stranger who was met by chance and can't be connected to the crime in any way, then there's no way that either man can get caught. While this is discussed jokingly by Guy (who forgets the conversation the second he leaves the train), Bruno is dead serious and is determined to carry the plan out, whether Guy is a willing participant or not. A great idea from a genious director. This film has all the black humour and great dialogue you've come to expect from Hitchcock, along with great acting, especially from Robert Walker as the sociopathic Bruno (we learn from his mother that he once plotted to blow up the White House). This film definitely starts the 1950's Hitchcock juggernaut, a smash hit that followed a number of box-office dissapointments in the mid to late '40's (the David O. Selznick co-production years). An interesting observation that many viewers will see and that many critics have mentioned (maybe not in 1951, but who knows?)is that the character of Bruno is obviously gay. It's not hard to spot. He's a man in his forties, living in silk bathrobed-luxury in his mother and father's estate, living off their cash, a noticeable dislike for women and no history of any romance. He even bears more than a passing resemblance to Rock Hudson. "But Guy, I like you!" It would be interesting to hear Hitchcock's comments on his casting choices, but the genious liked his secrets. Enjoy this film, it's a good one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After reading the comment before this, the plot, and a medium fan of Hitchcock, I was terribly disappointed with Strangers on a Train. The beginning plot was so horribly done-when did Guy indicate it was a deal or it even agreed with him? Anne Morton was the smartest one in wanting to go to the police. Any sane person would see Bruno was obsessed and disturbed, and believe poor Guy. As for the suspense, where was it?! The creep factor entered only when Bruno stalked Miriam and the suspense existed when Bruno was trying to get Guy's cig lighter from the drain. I'd recommend it only to die hard Hitchcock fans.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Patricia Highsmith on-screen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dmitri Tiomkin's music and some of the acting are a little over-the-top, but that was Hollywood in 1951. As usual, Alfred Hitchcock himself appears briefly, boarding the train with a double-bass case just after Farley Granger gets off. No one seems to have observed that, two minutes later, Patricia Highsmith, the author of this and the Tom Ripley novels, appears (uncredited) very prominently. When Guy Haines (Granger) goes into Miller's Music Store to speak with his wife Miriam, who seems to work there, Miriam is at the cash register. Just behind her, looking over her shoulder at Guy and Miriam (and exchanging a couple of interesting glances with Guy) is another apparent store employee. She's checking out shelves and writing on a pad. This is Patricia Highsmith, whose face appears at various ages on numerous book jackets. If the film was made in 1950 she would have been about 29. She's more attractive than all the other women in the film. I haven't been able to find any reference anywhere to her appearance in this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Masterfully Crafted Suspense</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Memorable for its famous 'criss-cross' murder scheme, "Strangers on a Train" is one of Hitchcock's most carefully crafted thrillers. The conflict between the two main characters is emphasized by many nicely constructed scenes and numerous carefully established contrasts. Although a couple of the important characters come across as somewhat passive, the suspense builds quickly and is sustained all the way to the end.The tension starts right away. A short, clever sequence shows two men meeting on a train, who then start to discuss the persons in their lives that most stand in the way of their happiness, and consider what they might do about these obstacles. Guy (Farley Granger) innocently shares his secrets with the sinister Bruno (Robert Walker), setting in motion a lengthy chain of shocking events that doesn't stop until a very eventful climax. Many scenes emphasize the differences and similarities between the two protagonists, which are quite interesting in themselves, besides being important as plot elements.Walker is outstanding as the ominous Bruno - his is one of the most memorable performances in any Hitchcock film. Granger and Ruth Roman (as his girlfriend) are both quite passive in comparison, almost lifeless at times, yet to a large degree this contrast is one of the themes of the film, and might have been undermined somewhat by stronger acting in these roles. And at any rate, the events and situations in the film are memorable enough to make up for any lack of energy on their part.This fine film is a must-see for Hitchcock fans and for anyone who likes classic thrillers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was really good. It's classic Hitchcock: edge-of-your-seat suspense plus elements of romance and humor. One of my favorite parts is when Bruno is at the carnival, and that annoying little kid comes up to him and goes "bang bang" with his fake gun. Bruno gives him a disgusted look, and as the kid walks away, Bruno turns around and sticks his cigarette in the kid's balloon so it pops.Another little tidbit that makes this movie good is that Hitchcock used his daughter, Patricia, in the role of Barbara Morton. I didn't know that she was Hitchcock's daughter, but I did say, "Hey, it's the girl who plays Caroline in 'Psycho'". Later, I found out this was true, but she was also Alfred Hitchcock's daughter. The performances by Farley Granger, Ruth Roman, and Leo G. Carroll are wonderful, but I think it's Robert Walker's performance as Bruno Antony that really steals the show. He embodies all the characteristics of a classic Hitchcock villain: witty, charming, and the ability to play with words to fool anybody. Hitchcock once said that a villain had to be charming and funny as well with a secret evil side, or else they wouldn't be believable. And I think "Strangers on a Train" proves this theory.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the hero as villain</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think this is Hitchcock's first of two undisputed masterpieces ("Psycho" being the second). It is insidiously subtle, which makes it a great candidate for subsequent viewings. His "strangers" are ingenious, opposing illustrations of malevolent opportunism.Like the tennis match, the opponents are set. Bruno, the villain, with the mommy-manicured hands that kill, verses Guy, the upwardly-mobile victim-hero. Yet, you agonize with suspense when Bruno stretches for the cigarette lighter in the storm drain, hoping for his success just as you cheer Guy on to win in three sets. But Bruno is a twisted maniac--you even get a sense of why from his parents--yet Guy is really an enigma, waffling so much you believe he's really going to kill Bruno's father. That's because Guy is really the veiled villain of the film. Nothing is known of his past. His handling of his wife in the record store could indicate merely poor choice in a life-mate, or an undisclosed violence vicariously lived through by Bruno. Opportunistic, placating, unctuously pleasing--that's Guy. He's at least partially responsible for his wife's murder by not taking Bruno seriously, and he certainly benefits by becoming unburdened to make a politically advantageous marriage to Anne Morton. He wants to "avoid trouble" rather than bring Bruno to justice. His way is the back stab--beautifully played out by his falsely-attempted murder of Bruno's father. Is it no wonder that he wants to become a politician?Hitchcock never gives us black and white. Just two more looks at the multi-faceted face of evil.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hitchcock and Highsmith No Strangers to Film Noir</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While &lt;Strangers&gt; is truly a classic, it is no masterpiece. The premise of Patricia Highsmith's thriller is intriguing. Alfred Hitchcock had nearly three decades of filmmaking under his belt by this time, and his signature touches abound. The Dimitiri Tiomkin soundtrack is a bit overwrought, but contains some quite elegant themes. Overall, though, the acting and script are pretty broad and hammy. The characters are so implausibly rendered that they sap much of the drama and suspense from the movie.Some Hitchcockian flourishes: his cameo, with double-bass in tow, at the train station; a murderer's shadow envelopes that of his victim, then a scream rings out; bizarre vantage to observe a strangulation, reflected in the convexity of eyeglass lenses; mounting tension with quick cuts between scenes of a tennis match and scrabbling for a cigarette lighter down a storm drain; the two 'strangers' wrestle in the climatic scene while the unrelenting hoofbeats of merry-go-round horses bear down on them.I am baffled that nearly a quarter of those rating this movie gave it a '10'. For me, this rating denotes perfection. Such a rating is far too generous. Dismissing its shortcomings as being a function of the era in which it was filmed is also too charitable: there were many fine films of that era, with plausible special effects, genuine suspense, and superb acting. See &lt;Quo Vadis?&gt;, &lt;The African Queen&gt;, &lt;High Noon&gt;, and &lt;On The Waterfront&gt; for better movies of this era. From Hitchcock himself, &lt;Rear Window&gt; is my favourite, if only to see the luminous Grace Kelly briefly light up the screen. And if it's perfection you're after, see &lt;Lawrence of Arabia&gt;, made only ten years after &lt;Strangers&gt;, but light years beyond it in terms of cast, cinematography, soundtrack, story--everything.&lt;Strangers&gt; is a must-see classic, but mainly as a point of cinematic reference. It inspired &lt;Throw Momma From The Train&gt;, was recently featured in an episode of &lt;CSI&gt;, has been referred to in more than a dozen movies, and has surged in popularity as a novel since Highsmith found a new audience following the film adaptation of &lt;The Talented Mr Ripley&gt;.7 of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I beg your pardon, but aren't you Guy Haines?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is an amusing and morbid concept, to be sure. Like train tracks criss-cross, one man does another's murder, and it rids both of any suspicion. Only someone like Bruno Anthony would really entertain the idea, and then actually carry it out. Robert Walker is no doubt the stand out performer here - he has that charming smile and carries himself gaily with an air of graceful formality that makes it so easy to be convinced and seduced as Mrs Cunnigham and co. do. We connect the dots in what he is suggesting like they do, and crack a giggle once we realise that pretty much everyone has uttered those fatal words in a fit of anger. He has even convinced his own mother of this fact, and is able to disarm with a deftly placed joke when necessary. But today the performance does verge on a sort of evil camp; his still, smiling profile amongst a sea of swivelling tennis spectators, the way he stalks Miriam in the love boats (which now reminds me of a strict father overseeing her shrieking daughter on a date), his smile and pose as a way of greeting Guy in that dark bedroom, and the blank cruelty in which he pops a child's balloon and walks on. It's like the charming, business side of a devil's incarnation, before he bursts into an embodiment of evil and flame and ash. Except we don't see that side of Walker. Besides the neatness of the concept, elsewhere Hitchcock has conjured contrivances in order to boost its dramatic tension. To soften the blow of murder he has uglied up Laura Elliott, given her a rather full face and figure compared to the graceful Ruth Roman, and these bug- eyed librarian spectacles - Barbara Morton just happens to own a similar pair. It's no wonder that Guy is eager to divorce and marry into the Morton's, who basically already treat him as their own. To make this decision even easier and to brush the idea of murder even further off our minds, he inserts these snide little remarks about Miriam's rather lose morals. No doubt the production code forbade any clear mention of this but we can tell all the same. The most egregious example however has to be the moment where Bruno accidentally drops the lighter into a grill and frantically tries to receive it. It's cross-cut with the urgency of Guy's tennis match, and as he goes closer to victory the out-stretched fingers of Bruno go closer to retrieving it. In a better film this would be an agonising, tense affair but here it just seems annoyingly coincidental. Certainly his visuals are at times beguiling: the way Bruno ushers Guy into the shadows for a fatal confession, behind bars, or how the murder is initially depicted in a reflection and then mirrored in Barbara's own spectacles (although it pales in comparison to what Vertigo achieves). There's a sense that the straight, conventional lives of these upper class citizens are being distorted into a violent, absurdist daydream. When Guy and Anne embrace and passionately kiss we hear stirring strings as we would expect, but then as murder takes place and then is reflected within Barbara, we hear cheery, amusement park tunes. It seems almost unbelievable that the master of tension could cut it all up, but Hitchcock does so in this film, and more than once. Here we see it from the slow, unsubtle zoom ins to the 'Bruno' name tag, to the clumsy tennis rallies that seem comically devoid of urgency (perhaps Hitchcock should have chosen another profession or sport) and in the way he will cut briefly to a still close-up of a gun as if to signal danger that wasn't already evident in Walker's stalker-like presence behind Granger on the darkened staircase. When Bruno is wrested from reality at the sight of Barbara's likeness to his murder victim, we see the pair in separate shots, worlds away from each other. Where is the imaginative use of space and staging that Hitchcock is so well known for? This most arresting, mysterious occurrence could have been shot in almost any other way and been more engaging.</fullReview>

The tennis player dismisses this idea but the other man seems determined to go through with his side of the plan...Good, original story, well told. Master director Alfred Hitchcock builds the tension well and creates a seemingly inescapable web for the victim to break out of. The Hitchcock signature tricks are all there: the camera angles, zoom in/outs, the drawing out of seconds into minutes, the race against the clock. Plus, he makes his usual cameo...Good work from Farley Granger and Robert Walker in the lead roles. Walker is particularly impressive as the deranged Bruno. Good support from Ruth Roman. Patricia Hitchcock, Alfred Hitchcock's daughter, also has a fairly significant supporting role.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the great cat-and-mouse thrillers in Cinematic History</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alfred Hitchcock is the master of suspense. He is also a master at suspending disbelief to better enjoy a film. I came into this movie with no preconceived ideas as to how it would turn out or how it was going to be. It was one of the most suspenseful films I have ever seen and at times, truly convincing.Without discussing the plot too much, it invokes the idea that anyone we meet anywhere could be a murderer. It makes us question our own moral views and ask ourselves "Have I ever wanted to commit a murder?" Of course, most of us do not follow through with it, but without a doubt all of us have thought about it. That's what this movie did for me. It made me question myself and those around me. Not to the point of paranoia, but just as an interesting and disturbing thought.Farley Granger stars as Guy Haines, a famous tennis player and a man on the verge of a divorce. One day, while riding the train he meets a stranger, Bruno Anthony (Robert Walker) who recognizes Guy and initiates a conversation with him. Bruno seems genuinely intrigued by Guy and it is this moment on the train that is really one of the greatest scenes I've seen in any film. It's the way Bruno looks and acts around Guy that makes it what it is. He seems interested yet almost a little too personal - you get the feeling he is a little obsessive about Guy Haines and his life. As the story unfolds, we begin to see that is indeed only putting it mildly. Alfred Hitchcock is a master of suspense, but also a master of suspending disbelief. I was drawn into the story from the first frame and there is not a single moment that keeps the story moving - relentlessly like a train. The climatic ending seemed rushed and in my opinion could have been done better, but you be the judge of that. No doubt it was "rushed" (you'll know what I mean), but it was a bit over the top. You just have to take the ending for what it is and draw your own conclusions on some things, but it will undoubtedly leave you shocked. Strangers on a Train is one of the great cat-and-mouse thrillers in cinematic history.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How could Hitch pull that off in 1951?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Films are usually not as good as the books they are drawn from. Unless Hitch is at the directorial reins. The book is fine. This film is so on the ragged edge, it's hard to believe Hitchcock got away with it in the year 1951. We're talking McCarthy years. It is a delight to see how censors are duped by a script as far over their heads as the Washington Monument.The story is one of two careers intersecting: one a straight trajectory of an up-and-coming tennis star pushing all the right buttons, the other of an insane socialite spiraling down towards the perfect murder as a pastime. The straight trajectory does not have a chance in the vortex of downward spiral, at least until the denouement.The film has all the usual masterful Hitchcock elements: the audience is fully informed on what will happen at the same time as the characters because the suspense is not derived from that; sexual innuendo, this time about homo-eroticism, abounds; the audience is forced to root for the evil murderer by the device of a lost pocket lighter; and so forth. What revs this up to a "9" from the more typical "8" I give later Hitchcocks, is the freshness with which he revels in the culture of his newly adopted homeland. Bruno (the socialite killer who forces the hand of tennis star Guy, aptly names as a nice everyman) is decadent Europe, Hitchcock's pre-WW2 haunt. Guy is the fresh new America. Fresh naiveté hardly has a chance at the feet of Euro-decadence. Well, not quite: Bruno's downward spiral ends with his death, fittingly at a merry-go round in an amusement park. Thus Hitchcock reaffirms the superiority of the simple good life after all, at the bitter end.The film is darkly comedic. In one scene at a tennis match, an audience of thousands twist their heads to follow the ball back and forth, like clockwork robots. One man sits in the middle of this, staring motionlessly at his prey... It is so artificial, yet also heightened realism. If only the director of "Snowpiercer" had possessed that ability of blending reality and the unreal at that level!The film is in black and white, fittingly for its subject of starkly contrasting characters and careers. It could have been filmed in color in 1951, but Hitchcock knew better. Effects like the tennis match crowd and merry go round would have been destroyed, or at least damped, by mere color.They don't make 'em like that anymore. Thrillers that is. Still plenty of good movies around, although Hitch is a unique star in the firmament of thriller directors. If you liked this, and you want to see a very different solution to a similar "basically good person touched by decadent evil" problem, watch Preminger's "Laura," a much more conventional but also well-done thriller.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>'Noir' is an understatement</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of Hitchcock's best films and arguably one of the greatest movies ever made, Strangers on a Train pairs a brilliantly dark story with fantastic execution. On top of some incredible acting by the two leads, Hitchcock uses diegetic (and sometimes non-diegetic) sound to great effect as a way of revealing the characters' thoughts; take for instance the police sirens in the background of a scene where Guy Haines is nervous, or the sound of a passing train as a character becomes enraged and contemplates murdering somebody. Music also plays a big part in the film, especially a recurring funfair tune that becomes increasingly more sinister to listen to as the story develops. This melody is even used as a way of conveying a character's flashback in one of the film's most worrying moments. The best acting performance comes from Robert Walker, playing the creepy and insane Bruno Antony, a man with a moral code so twisted that it becomes worryingly logical. Even sixty years later, his scenes in the film have inspired new ones such as the Joker's speeches in The Dark Knight and Hans Landa's unexpected laughing fit in Inglorious Basterds. This is a film that will go down in history as a landmark achievement in cinema; not only is it a masterpiece of film noir, it's a brilliantly subtle black comedy as well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is an action packed film in witch murder, promises, and wits are taken to a whole new level.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As the title implies this movie starts on a train where Bruno Antony, a manipulative socialite, played by Robert Walker, meets, Guy Haines, a professional tennis player (Farley Granger). After some over sharing about the people that "they would like to get rid of", Bruno convinces Guy that they should both murder the other one's annoyance. Therefore, the police would never think to consider the other a suspect. Thinking that his seat mate is a little off mentally, Guy takes no notice of the talk of murder.Dismissing the idea, Guy parts ways with his new acquaintance, thinking that they would never see each other again, but boy was Guy wrong. When his wife is found dead a week later, Guy is immediately forced with the question- whether to follow through with his promise to Bruno or not. Whatever his choice, the police are already pointing fingers, and Guy Haines is their prime suspect.Brilliantly cast is Robert Walker who embodies the role of the psychotic murderer he plays in this story of wit vs. will. Walkers also has a certain madness that he brings with the role, that is frighteningly convincing to the viewer. While all the actors gave a great performance, I feel that Walker himself really brought the movie to life. Through his acting and Hitchcock's directing this movie is the Hitchcock classic we know it as today. This wouldn't be an iconic Hitchcock film if it wasn't for the suspenseful climb to the climax and even the end. Using a combination of dramatic shots and tense music Hitchcock gives us a window into the anxiety and excitement of murder. This climb really earns this movie the title of a "thriller" and is nothing less than expected from Hitchcock.Ratings wise, I would give this movie ten out of ten stars. The plot was well thought out, the characters had good motives, great actors, and impeccable camera-work and editing. Hitchcock really hit this one out of the park. I would recommend this movie to anyone with a love of adventure. As for age- this movie would probably best suit anyone over the age of ten, as the plot and storyline may be hard to comprehend for anyone younger. There are no gruesome scenes or extremely foul language in the movie, and all violence is only implied.Overall I would watch this movie again and recommend it to everyone I know (see above paragraph for age limits). As many times as I see it, I am yet again reminded and impressed with the technical and musical skill involved in making this movie the classic thriller it is known as today. I am also reminded of what a good job Hitchcock does of seamlessly working in humor with drama, and earns him the title as "the King Of Suspense". This film is about as good as it gets. As for a moral, I would probably say, "Nothing good comes out of talking to people on the train." or "Make sure your witnesses aren't drunk."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A brilliant first half that perfectly balances suspense with Hitchcock's humor</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"I have the perfect weapon right here: these two hands."In my opinion, Hitchcock's Golden Age was definitely the 50's when he released some of his most beloved classic films: Rear Window, North by Northwest, and Vertigo. I'd include Psycho on that list as well which was released in 1960. But in 1951, the Master of Suspense directed a wonderful thriller which could've very well been considered among that group if it weren't for some minor flaws near the end. Strangers on a Train hooks you from the very beginning as the camera follows the footsteps of two separate men getting on a train. Their feet bump into each other and the camera reveals who they are: Guy Haines (Farley Granger) and Bruno Antony (Robert Walker). Bruno instantly recognizes Guy, an up and coming tennis player who is currently dating Anne Morton (Ruth Roman), a Senator's daughter. We hear this from Bruno's mouth who tells Guy everything he's read about him in the papers. Bruno introduces himself as a wealthy socialite and despite his psychotic behavior, Guy listens to him patiently while he waits for his next stop. The conversation serves as a very practical way to introduce us to the backstory of these characters. He claims to know that Guy is married to Miriam (Kasey Rogers) who has been unfaithful to him many times over the past and is waiting for a divorce settlement to be able to marry his new love. Bruno goes on saying that it would be much easier to simply murder his wife and he gives him the perfect solution: they can cross murders. Bruno wants his millionaire father out of the picture and believes Guy could do him the favor. Guy thinks Bruno is simply kidding and gets off at the next stop, but what he doesn't know is that Bruno is serious about his offer and plans to stick with his own made up plan. Watching the film today, the plot sounds very familiar to dozens of thrillers that have been released since, but I can't say with certainty if in 1951 this was a unique idea. The screenplay was adapted from Patricia Highsmith's novel and it is perhaps one of the greatest strengths of the film. What I can say is that Hitchcock handles the suspense in a very engaging way, building interesting characters and tense situations. Farley Granger and Ruth Roman play a believable and likable couple who the audience easily can identify with, but it is Robert Walker who steals the show. Walker plays his psychotic character to perfection, and during the first half of the film he is portrayed as a very clever and disturbed person that will keep you guessing as to what he might do next. His proposal during the beginning of the film is delivered in a very tempting way and he succeeded at creating an uncomfortable atmosphere on that train alongside Granger. The scene where he follows Miriam through a fair ground is also very memorable. Hitchcock set the perfect thriller during the first half of the film, but unfortunately he put too much effort in the climax making some of the suspense feel forced at times instead of letting the story unfold naturally. It is a shame that Walker passed away shortly after the film was released because it would've been interesting to see what he could do next working alongside Hitchcock. Bruno is one of the best psychotic characters I've seen on screen, but the ending did leave me unsatisfied. Strangers on a Train doesn't only deliver clever thrills, but it also has several moments of dark humor as well. His daughter, Patricia Hitchcock, plays Anne's sister and she has some of the funniest scenes of the movie. The relationship between Bruno and his mother, played by Marion Lorne, is also full of dark humor especially during the first scene in which they are shown together. That is what I enjoyed the most during the first half of the film which managed to set an interesting (although familiar by now) premise and balance the suspense with Hitchcock's sense of humor. That dark humor disappears during the second half and everything centers exclusively on the suspense where I believe Hitchcock tried a bit too hard to force things. Even Walker's character loses some of his psychotic charm here and the film takes a much more predictable turn. Strangers on a Train is a very entertaining movie, but that first half had so much potential that this could've been one of Hitchcock's greatest films if that balance weren't lost in the second half. http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hitchcock at his best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Strangers on a Train is among Hitchcock's best films, and contains perhaps the strangest and most fascinating performance in any of his films. On par with Anthony Perkin's bird like creepiness in Psycho, Robert Walker's Bruno is an entirely new species of villain - a quiet, thoughtful sociopath that we despise but can't take our eyes off of. Tragically, Walker died soon after this film was made, leaving behind what would be his most enduring role, with almost nothing else to compare it against. It's a singular, wonderful performance. Classic Hitchcock, and one of his more underrated films from an equally fascinating book by Patricia Highsmith.</fullReview>

Guy is in love with Senator's daughter Anne Morton (Ruth Roman) but he needs to divorce his wife Miriam (Kasey Rogers). Bruno hates his rich father who expects him to pull his weight. Bruno proposes to switch murders criss-cross and Guy tries to brush him off. Miriam is pregnant with another's baby and refuses to divorce Guy trying to blackmail him. Bruno goes ahead and kills Miriam expecting Guy to kill his father. When Guy refuses, Bruno hounds him. Bruno still has the lighter Guy left on the train. The police closes in on Guy since he had the motive and also made a public scene earlier with Miriam. Guy's only alibi Prof. Collins is too drunk to remember him.Robert Walker has the tougher character to play and he does a good job. I don't particularly like his forced 'manic' laugh but he does have the creepy factor. He does that clingy delusional character in a very disturbing way. Farley Granger is a little stiff in the straight laced character. Ruth Roman is also a little stiff. Actually Hitchcock's daughter Patricia has some fun as the exuberant little sister. She's very good in the pivotal role. Hitchcock has some great shots like the tennis crowd where Bruno is the only one staring straight ahead. This is a great Hitchcock thriller.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic Hitchcock film noir</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For a synopsis of the plot, etc., read other reviews. I just want to give my thoughts on this movie.Strangers On A Train (1951) is a great black and white Hitchcock movie that's very dark, quite scary, even terrifying at times, especially at the end of the movie. I won't reveal the ending. Watch to find out. This movie is presented in full screen and stars Farley Granger, Ruth Roman, Robert Walker, and Patricia Hitchcock (Hitchcock's daughter). I thought Pat Hitchcock gave a good performance. She's actually a pretty good actress. This movie features some pretty unique settings, such as a carnival, a tennis stadium, and of course a train. It also shows something that's typical of so many Hitchcock films -the dark side of humanity with an evil man going about his evil deeds, as well as an innocent man falsely accused. In my opinion, this is one of the better Hitchcock movies and is a personal favorite of mine, definitely in my top five. The camera angles, the suspense, the rather dark atmosphere, the darkness of the story - it all adds up to one great movie. The score is pretty good and the acting is great. The script is really good.I highly recommend Strangers On A Train.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Two Taboo Aspects</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No need to recap the plot or echo consensus points. Suffice that this is one of Hitch's most suspenseful movie achievements. Instead, I want to briefly note a couple of aspects. Catch the innuendo when Bruno stalks Miriam at the fun park. Hitch has to separate her from her two escorts so that Bruno can throttle her, and he hasn't much time to do it in. So we get the instant sexual attraction from her licking an ice cream cone while he raises the bar to ring the bell. Thus, a whole emotional distance is overlapped in two shorthand, if strongly suggestive, steps. Then there's Robert Walker's wonderfully fey performance, rather daring for its time. In my view, the tinge of effeminacy is not just an affectation the actor has chosen to color Bruno's character with. Rather it's essential to the plot. The gay tinge explains why Bruno is so eager to cement the murder swap on such short acquaintance with the handsome Guy. In effect, he's attracted to Guy beyond what he thinks is their bargain. Thus, his rather pleading and seductive manner speaks volumes. Without that aspect, we might wonder why Bruno presumes as much with a train acquaintance as he does. It's a genuinely memorable and creepy performance.I mention these two aspects because they imply subjects that were then taboo. Yet Hitch manages to work them meaningfully into the plot. In his own sly way, he chipped away at censorship as effectively as any moviemaker of the period. Yes indeed, behind that misleading Humpty-Dumpty facade, dwelt Hollywood's cleverest talent.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A well crafted, tense, and enjoyable Hitchcock thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Whilst travelling on a train, Guy Haines (Farley Granger) and Bruno Antony (Robert Walker) begin chatting to one another. The conversation between the 2 men starts off innocently enough, but the conversation takes a darker turn when Antony starts discussing how to commit the perfect murder. It seems that both men have people in their lives that they would rather not have around - Haines promiscuous wife who he is planning on divorcing and Antony with his oppressive father. Antony believes that if Haines kills his father and he kills Haines' wife that they will have both committed the perfect murder as motives for each killing will have been eliminated. Haines gets off the train not thinking much of the conversation he'd had with Antony. However, Antony is serious about 'swapping murders' and is fully intent on seeing the plan through.This is Hitchcock at his very best. The very fact that he's once again taken a simple story and turned it into a stylish, engrossing and tense thrill ride just goes to show how gifted he really was. There were some creepy directional touches to this film - the shadowy silhouettes in the tunnel of love, the creepy scene where Haines goes up the stairs in Antony's home. You know when you're witnessing great directional touches like this that you're watching a Hitchcock film.The main reason to watch this film is for Robert Walker's excellent portrayal as the psychotic and deeply disturbed Bruno Antony. When I watched him, I couldn't help but be reminded of Robert Mitchum when he starred in films such as Night of the Hunter and Cape Fear. Like Walker, Mitchum had a natural gift for playing characters that were thoroughly despicable, but when necessary could be extremely charming. There is a scene where Antony is talking to 2 women and he once again is talking about his obsession with creating the 'perfect murder' and manages to persuade a women to let him put his hands round her throat to show her how he'd commit the murder. How many women would allow a complete stranger to do that? This is what I mean about Walker's character - he could charm the birds out of the trees when he wanted to, but had a deadly psychotic side to him as well. This made him a fascinating character who was interesting to watch throughout. It's a great shame that he died so young as I believe that he probably would have had a very long career ahead of him in film.The supporting cast were all generally good, but this film really belongs to Walker and it is he that gives the strongest performance by a mile. If I was to levy any criticism at all with Strangers on a Train it would lie with Farley Granger's performance as Guy Haines. To be honest, I didn't find him convincing at all and thought that his performance was a bit 'wooden'. Maybe I feel this way because Walker was so impressive in his role that it's meant that Granger suffers in comparison.The final 20 minutes are classic Hitchcock which will have you on the edge of your seat. It's not the best Hitchcock film I've seen, but it's well worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What about the guy who crawls under the moving carousel?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are some who assert that paranoia is an element in film noir. Yet, there seems to be no evidence of paranoia in the plots of the movie Strangers on a Train. Bruno Anthony is a sociopath. His actions are premeditated. It is his premeditation that makes his behavior so chilling. As for Guy Haines, his fear is not a function of paranoia. He has a legitimate reason to be afraid. Guy conspired with Bruno to commit murder. That Guy conspired in jest makes it no less a conspiracy. The fact that Bruno possesses Guy's lighter is proof that the two of them had established some kind of connection. That the police keep the lighter is evidence that they were not finished with Guy. Robert Walker's performance as a sociopathic killer is uncanny, proof of his skill as an actor. He becomes the epitome of the amoral, narcissistic person who will stop at nothing to gratify his needs. Perhaps the performances that most closely approximate the intensity and style of Walker's performance as a "severely disturbed person" are Jessica Walter's as a homicidal stalker obsessed with a radio disc jockey in Play Misty for Me and Andy Robinson's as a sadistic murderer and kidnapper in Dirty Harry. Harry Hines, the actor who is under the carousel in Strangers, deserves at least an honorable mention.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Strong supporting performances, direction and plot makes "Strangers" worthy of a viewing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Have you ever been acquainted with a person whom you thought was just joking around, but was actually deadly serious? In director Alfred Hitchcock's 1951 mystery "Strangers on a Train", tennis player Guy Haines (Farley Granger) encounters such a man named Bruno Anthony (Robert Walker) on his way back home on a train. Bruno tells him that he has figured out an idea for a perfect crime and the idea goes something like this. Two people like themselves meet on a train for the first time with no connections between them whatsoever. Both of them are aggravated with certain family members that they wish would go away. The "perfect crime" that Bruno has in mind is to swap each other's murders. In other words, Bruno murders Guy's ex-wife and Guy murders Bruno's father. Thinking that Bruno is kidding about the whole thing, Guy bids him farewell while unintentionally sending him a mixed message. Yes, Guy seems to overlook the fact that Bruno was deadly serious about this plan the whole time. So when Bruno manages to murder Guy's ex-wife, Guy is left in an unfortunate, puzzling situation. Does he fulfill his end of the bargain regardless of the fact that he didn't officially agree to this deal in the first place? Or does he find some sort of way to turn Bruno in even though he knows Bruno might say that Guy wanted to get rid of his wife in the first place and conjure up similar lies about their encounter? Right off the bat, the first thing I must say about "Strangers on a Train" is that it has a perfect premise for a plot. I love how Guy isn't sure whether or not Bruno is for real or if he's just joking about this the whole time. If you think about it, the reason this premise is so outstanding is due in large part to its dark sense of humor. There is a crucial exchange of conversation between Guy and Bruno in which Guy is completely unaware of the subtext behind what Bruno is really asking him. It's because of this conversation that Guy fails to see that Bruno wasn't really asking him to murder his father. He pretty much forced him to participate in his diabolical murder plan solely for his own benefits. So the film is well thought through in that sense. In terms of character development, although the character of Bruno was exceptionally well handled and superbly acted by Robert Walker, anything else relating to Guy for whatever reason was a bit of a bore. Despite the complicated dilemma he has to face, there wasn't anything else about Guy that stood out for me personally. He was a little too much of a blank slate character wise. Guy's love interest Anne Morton (Ruth Roman) wasn't memorable in the slightest and didn't contribute much to the advancement of the narrative. However, there is an entertaining side character named Barbara Morton (Patricia Hitchcock, Alfred Hitchcock's sole daughter) who has a handful of scene-stealing lines to work with. In spite of the overwhelming feeling that "Strangers on a Train" is only a good film as opposed to a great one, the film is well directed by Hitchcock as always. The scene involving Bruno's murder of Guy's ex-wife has a superb build-up including a shot where it appears that he is getting closer to murdering his victim, but actually isn't. Another scene that intercuts between Guy's tennis match and Bruno recovering a piece of evidence is also well directed. The climax at the merry-go-round also has a similarly brilliant buildup and of course is loaded with suspense as it should be. With an exceptional plot, scene- stealing work from Robert Walker and Patricia Hitchcock, and Alfred Hitchcock's trustworthy directorial hand, "Strangers on a Train" is worth catching a single viewing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Alfred Hitchcock directed this classic thriller that stars Farley Granger as Guy Haines, a professional tennis player who one day meets Bruno Antony(played by Robert Walker) on a train. He is a strange man who ingratiates himself with Guy. They tell each other their problems, and Bruno comes up with a morbid idea: Since the number one problem with getting away with murder is alibi, he proposes that they switch murders, or "criss/cross", so that Bruno would murder Guy's wife(they don't love each other anymore) and Guy would murder Bruno's hated father, that way the police would never suspect them, because there is no motive! Guy shrugs this off as fantasy, but Bruno turns out to be quite serious, and plunges Guy into a nightmare he may not be able to get out of... Ingenious premise is very well-handled in this suspenseful and well-acted thriller, with innovative and lively direction, and a smart script that makes the most of its premise. Hair-raising climax in the amusement park tops off this excellent film.</fullReview>

Things are however set in motion when the psychopath eventually goes on to implement his ideas for real.The direction by Hitchcock is very impressive, screenplay is deftly written, each moment is captured in stunning level of detail thanks to its impeccable photography, editing effectively paces the story from its opening moments &amp; never lets the tension fizzle out, music is splendidly scored and the performances by its entire cast is no short of amazement.On an overall scale, Strangers on a Train succeeds effortlessly &amp; ingeniously in sustaining its suspenseful atmosphere until the very end and also exhibits the artistic side of its legendary director. It'll find a high spot whether you put it into the genre of crime, thriller or even film- noir, and with its strong visual themes &amp; motifs, it'll always remain a fascinating study in the art of filmmaking around the world.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic and deeply significant Hitchcock</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Adapting a classic suspense novel without intending to follow the novel's story line, it starts as a simply photographed black and white film offering no bells or whistles in what was the era of early 1950's Hollywood technical advances. It then turns into one of the classic suspense films of all time and has justly earned its reputation as Pure Hollywood Gold. Robert Walker leads the villains, among them Laura Elliot and Marion Lorne who mutually possess no sense of social or moral conscience and do harm to the innocent. Farley Granger leads the supposedly chaste and moral social and political climbers, among them Ruth Roman, Hitchcock's daughter, Patricia and Leo G. Carroll whose mutual upright standing and surface community success belie self serving personal motives with no honest emotional attachment to those they claim as dear friends and relations. A possibly or not accidental or not meeting of Walker and Granger on a train leads to ever more exciting and ever more superbly photographed and edited sequences of both sets of characters headed down the garden path to the villains doing more and more evil deeds and the social and political climbers more and more protective of their possibly challenged surface social positions. This is superbly played out within the surface framework of a twisted psychopath trying to ruin an amateur tennis superstar scheming to rise from a poor boy background to marrying a senator's daughter and going into politics. The ending features a runaway carousel with an officer shooting toward innocent people unbelievably set up as moving targets, the psychopath finally apprehended into criminal custody and the social climber finally freed of misrepresented criminal charges.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>At the time director Alfred Hitchcock filmed STRANGERS ON A TRAIN in the early 1950s, his native England's "bobbies" (police, we'd call them) seldom carried guns--on-duty or off-. In an early objection to American gun culture by a "John Bull" born and raised (predating CNN's Piers Morgan by more than half a century), "Hitch" has a Yankee cop shoot and kill the operator of a kid-packed merry-go-round with no "dead-hand" safety switch, resulting in a disaster which obviously kills dozens of U.S. children at the end of STRANGERS (reminiscent of the bomb blowing up the kid on a London bus at the climax of Hitchcock's earlier offering, SABOTAGE). The rotund gourmand is making several points in his STRANGERS outing. 1)Bad guys carry guns (Bruno offers one to tennis star Guy as a rite of passage into the Evil-doers Club). 2)Good guys with guns have at least a 50-50 chance of wounding or killing innocent people when they shoot (just look at the NYPD if you need recent examples reinforcing Hitchcock's theory). 3)If you need to kill someone, strangling is far less messy. 4)Beware the carousel!</fullReview>

Like Walker, Granger also has the role of his career and he acquits himself quite well as the weak tennis pro. Hitchcock masterfully builds up the suspense, leading to a frenetic finale that unfortunately is marred somewhat by a ridiculous scene on a merry-go- round.

The story is simple, a crazed sociopath (Bruno, played by Robert Walker) meets with a tennis star (Guy Haines played by Farley Granger) on a train as 'strangers', here Bruno reveals his plan for a perfect murder in which two complete strangers can 'switch' murders in order to avoid suspicion. Little does Guy know that this is a plan that Bruno intends to enact.The dialogue is wonderful in this film, the most entertaining aspect probably for me, this being no surprise of course as the scriptwriter is the wonderful Raymond Chandler. Probably the best thing about it for me was the way dark humor was implemented so carefully. Of course, this being a Hitchcock film, the direction is masterful, an original shot in each scene, so many hidden treats for the audience to decipher. The film's finale is also very riveting and thrilling.The performance by Farley Granger felt a little forced at times, however this is not a major problem. Ruth Roman was really great in her role as Guy's girlfriend Anne.However the best performer is easily Robert Walker. One of the most coolest and disturbing villains of the noir-type and in fact the entirety of the film universe. The way his image is haunting and his ability to turn up everywhere Guy is proves to be a well handled driving force for the film. And he also manages to be devilishly funny at the same time. All in all a great film, one of Hitchcocks finest, most riveting pieces of work.Strangers on a Train= 8.3</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It is a crazy idea, holds the suspense flag high for most part but what it could have been so much more</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While the idea is quite inventive and dangerous to sell on mass media, I don't think it's potential was fully realized. Though it features some terrific acting, suspense and drama, the thriller elements were not exactly compatible with the premise presented. What could've been so much more, ends up as your average Hitchcock thriller. Two strangers Guy Haines (Farley Granger) and Bruno Antony (Robert Walker) strike a conversation on a train mostly initiated by the latter. While Guy is a tennis player in love with a senator's daughter Anne Morten (Ruth Roman) and trying to persuade his wife for a divorce, Bruno is a spoiled child of a rich business man not getting in terms with his father. Both wish their wife and father dead respectively and Bruno proposes a plan jovially to exchange murders since it is easier not to get caught. Guy dismisses the notion immediately and ends the conversation. Bruno goes forward with his plan and kills the wife and starts blackmailing Guy to kill his father. With police getting suspicious and Bruno on his back, can Guy do the unthinkable? Well there is no doubt the premise is fresh and exhilarating boosted by Robert Walker's character with casual yet mean qualities. But it is quite incomprehensible the way the script turned out to be. With the best idea for a murder already half executed, each character does their best to get themselves caught, for instance Anne Morten and their sister instantly find out that there is something amiss and even finds out what is going on without either of them saying a word. Apart from Robert Walker, rest of the acting cast has just shelled out average performances. Background score is decent in parts so is the cinematography. What were not so convincing: 1. Bruno committing the first murder even without confirming if Guy is still in the vicinity of the crime scene and whether he has an alibi etc. 2. Wisdom of the cop during the climax who shoots at the suspect riding on merry-go-round in a carnival with so many children around. The suspect neither knows that the cops are there and nor is he running away. 3. Inexplicable behavior of Bruno in presence of Barbara. It is a crazy idea, holds the suspense flag high for most part but what it could have been so much more.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Strangers on a Train' is one of Hitchcock's slightly known and considered obscure pictures. I think of it as an ingenious tale of two men who meet by coincidence and begin a bizarre conversation on swapping murders. The theory becomes a distorted reality when one goes through with his plan and murders the other's wife and frames the other for the murder. Farley Granger and Robert Walker are fabulous as Guy Haines (Granger) and Bruno Anthony (Walker, the two strangers now intertwined in this web of love, lies and murder. I saw this film upon rental from my local library and found the film to be clever and well done. I highly recommend this film for anyone who enjoys a thrilling mystery with high moments of suspense.</fullReview>

The power of the movie is how both funny and thrilling it is at the same time. I suppose that is quite artistic and what adds to this masterpiece of set pieces and Hitchcockian thrillers.

		<shortDescription>A Great Movie All Around</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Logan YerbeyStrangers on a train is a brilliant movie made for any generation. Although the idea of commuters taking trains from one place to another, the basic idea of two unrelated travelers meeting each other by chance is very much applicable to this day and age. The simple idea of killing the other person's enemy is very much an original plot, although it seems simple enough. When we pair this idea with the character of Bruno Antony, we can see where this movie went right. Antony, a great example of an insane antagonist, gives a very suspenseful and eerie quality to the movie. The viewer oftentimes could not foresee what Antony would do next, as he repeatedly tried and tried to convince Guy Haines to follow through with what Antony perceived was their arrangement. This movie has a great mixture of a sense of good and evil, all while perfectly explaining the secretive motives of Haines throughout the picture. The camera work here was something I quite enjoyed myself. The idea of the glasses was perfectly played, as we saw Antony killing the girl, through the point of view of her glasses which were laying on the ground. This was seen again and again as the movie progressed as the idea of the glasses was always related to fire, death, and other deadly imagery. This movie is a work of art, and if you haven't seen it, then by god see it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Strangers on a Train" - Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Strangers on a Train" is definitely worthy of being categorized as a member of the film noir genre. It had some noticeably different filming techniques than a film representing the Classic Hollywood style. As soon as the movie begins. our two main characters our introduced, but all we can see of them are their legs walking. The camera is very low towards the ground, and just seems to move as they do following them up and onto the train. I believe it is when they bump feet with each other that we finally get to see their faces. Another great camera shot during the film is when Robert Walker's character finally catches up to Kasey Rogers' character at the carnival. As he's strangling her, we are forced to witness this crime through Miriam's glasses, which have fallen off her face to the ground. A reflection of her death is shown on the lens of her glasses. Miriam may have been mean by not accepting well-needed divorce, but she never deserved to be murdered. That's not the way that Bruno Antony saw it though. He believed that by killing her, Guy Haines would then do his part of the deal and kill Bruno's father. It never quite worked out that way. Film noir genre films were also known for their snappy and "cool" dialogue. In this film, the psychotic man from the train never stops spitting out his lines. He seems to get right down to the point of doing each other's murders. In was amazing how fast they reached that point in the conversation, considering the fact that Robert Walker's character was pretty much the one doing all the talking. "Strangers on a Train" is truly a tale about the corruption of innocence. None of the main characters asked for a psycho to interfere with their lives. Robert Walker's character tells Farley Granger's character that he can't even call the police on him because he'd be turning himself in too, since they discussed these murders once before on the train. All in all, this was an excellent film directed by one of the greatest film auteur directors of all time, Alfred Hitchcock.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Splendid and nail-biting thriller from Alfred Hitchcock</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alfred Hitchcock is my all time favourite director, his films are full of his fashioned touches and masterful technique, a vast majority of them are compelling from start to finish. Strangers on a Train is one of those compelling films, even though Hitchcock clashed with the script writer several times and was underwhelmed by Farley Granger's lead performance, it is still a gripping movie. For one thing it is very well made, the cinematography is crisp and beautiful and the setting is authentic. Also helping add to the nail-biting atmosphere is the outstanding music score, while sometimes romantic it is also haunting and tense. Then we have a very good screenplay, superb direction from Hitchcock and two particularly brilliant scenes at the fairground(the second being the better one in my opinion). The acting is stellar, while I found Farley Granger dull in Rope, this dullness works for his tennis-champion character and it was an understated performance I really liked. Ruth Roman and Patricia Hitchcock are alluring and convincing in their roles, and Leo G.Carroll is memorable as Senator Morton. Robert Walker is absolutely amazing as Bruno though, he is eccentric, cold-hearted, smooth-talking and very chilling. Overall, a splendid nail-biter, a definite winner from Hitch. 10/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of Hitchcock's Very Best Murders</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Amateur tennis star Guy Haines (Farley Granger) wants to divorce his unfaithful wife, Miriam (Kasey Rogers), in order to be able to marry the woman he loves, Anne Morton (Ruth Roman), the daughter of a senator. But Miriam does not want the divorce, and instead plans to live off Haines' money. While on a train to meet Miriam, Haines meets the psychopathic Bruno Anthony (Robert Walker). Bruno recognizes Guy and knows something of his marital problems from gossip items in the newspapers. Bruno proceeds to tell Guy about his idea for a perfect murder.Bruno is like a young, evil incarnation of Bill Murray. Miriam is shockingly beautiful, much more so than the Senator's daughter... besides the whole cheating, money-grubbing thing. Really, Robert Walker steals this film. Farley Granger is the hero, but Walker is the character that keeps the pace going and the plot twists and turns interesting.Hitchcock is at his storytelling best here. The idea seems so familiar simply because the movie is now part of the popular culture. And amazingly, Bruno gets away again and again, despite making multiple appearances and phone calls and letters that really should have foiled his plan from the very beginning. But hey, it's just a movie, and sometimes you get a better story if you stretch reality a bit (though at moments this one almost borders on "Twilight Zone").I like Hitchcock best when he's dealing with murder and mystery, so this is right up my alley. If you're of a similar taste, you'll love this. It has easily stood the test of time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Alfred Hitchcock's "Strangers on a Train" is one of his many classic thrillers. The story concerns an amateur tennis star (Farley Granger) who has a chance meeting with a charming psychopath (Robert Walker) while travelling by train. Next thing you know he's being blackmailed into carrying out a murder.The cast is only alright in my opinion. Robert Walker delivers a deliciously villainous performance but Farley Granger &amp; Ruth Roman are too bland to make much of an impression. In retrospect, this makes for a decent contrast but I still would've appreciated a couple of more interesting characters and actors. In most scenes they're outshone by memorable supporting players like Leo G. Carroll, Marion Lorne &amp; (Alfred's daughter) Pat Hitchcock.The story is a compelling one but I initially found myself somewhat indifferent to Granger's predicament since he's far less interesting than Walker's character. However, when I viewed the 'preview' version afterwards I came to the conclusion that he's a decent enough protagonist. Unfortunately, by that time the impact of Hitchcock's carefully crafted suspense was dulled by my first viewing.Hitchcock's direction is top-notch and shows some interesting touches which contribute to, rather than distract from, the story's tension. However, the film's only Oscar nomination was for the cinematography, which I would say was warranted. Dimitri Tiomkin's score supplies another piece in the puzzle while rarely taking the spotlight.I think that a couple of bland performances hurt the film a little but Hitchcock's mastery and Robert Walker's standout performance more than make up for it. By the way, the 'preview' version is very similar to the final version with only a few subtle changes made for the better (in my opinion).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A thrilling Train ride</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not a review of the "Special Edition" (don't know how it's different really) but of previous releases: The problem with Hitchcock is that he has been so lionized, that critics thumbs-up everything he's done, and lets face it, even Hitch himself recognized that some of his films (particularly from the early part of his career) tended to be a bit loose, and drag even - one of the reasons behind the remake of 'The Man Who Knew Too Much.' But, that certainly isn't the case with 'Strangers on a Train'. This is easily one of the best films Hitchcock ever made. Never a dull moment, this thriller races along like... well, a speeding train. That's not to say that there isn't a lot of suspense. From the moment the protagonist, Guy Haines, meets the antagonist, Bruno Anthony, one of the cinema's most memorable villains, we know we're in for a tense ride. There's just something indescribably creepy about Bruno, as played by Robert Walker. A big chunk of the credit also needs to go to the writers, particularly Patricia Highsmith, one of America's greatest crime novelists, and those who adapted it (including Raymond Chandler).Other things worth checking out here include Hitch's requisite cameo (blink and you'll miss it), and Alfred's daughter Patricia Hitchcock as a crime-obsessed young lady.Both the American and British versions are good, the American version is shorter, but contains an extra scene at the end. The British version is longer, and gives more insight into the characters during their initial meeting. Between the two, I recommend the British version - not for content reasons, but because it is better preserved and makes for a cleaner transfer to DVD.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The perfect crime. Many have dreamed about it and would do it if they thought they could get away with it. Bruno (Robert Walker) recognizes Guy (Farley Granger) on a train and proposes the perfect crime. It would have worked, had Bruno made sure that Guy was in agreement.One thing that you recognize immediately is that Hitchcock made splendid casting choices here. Walker and Granger were perfect for the roles. Bruno was definitely gay, even if you couldn't state it in 1951. He wasn't an effeminate gay, however, as he showed at the fair when tracking Guy's wife, the cheating Miriam (Kasey Rogers). I fact Guy seemed to be the effeminate one, weak and indecisive, but he was definitely hetero, as he wanted to get rid of his wife to marry the Senator's (Leo G. Carroll) daughter Anne (Ruth Roman).Bruno kept following Guy, and almost gave himself away when he met Anne's sister, played by Patricia Hitchcock, Alfred's real daughter, who bore a striking resemblance to Miriam. Anne was becoming increasingly suspicious.Forced to tell all to Anne what was going on, Guy enlists her and her sister's help in trying to clear himself. The police are right on his tail as the excitement ratchets up tremendously.A great finale and a bit of a surprise.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Ideas for a perfect murder"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the most unrecognised facets of Alfred Hitchcock's genius was his subversive touch when it came to casting. In some of the most memorable roles in his pictures, he didn't so much cast against type, but teased something sinister out of a performer's existing screen persona. Here, he took Robert Walker's sensitive, vulnerable but above all trustworthy image, and fitted it to a deeply disturbed yet seemingly innocent character. This sort of thing was potentially devastating to the star system, where typecasting was essential to studio marketing methods. Hitch couldn't have got away with it in the 1930s, but by this point things were starting to change in the way the studios controlled their stars, and in any case, Hitchcock was now such a respected figure there was a lot more he could get away with.Speaking of which, this is among the most overtly stylised of Hitchcock's Hollywood pictures. From Robert Walker's Gothic mansion, to shock shots like the painting of St Francis or the twisting carousel horses, it is full of bizarre yet curiously effective touches. The best scene is surely the murder at the fairground, a somewhat light-hearted suspense sequence. This has perhaps the most intelligent employment of sound in a Hitchcock picture, with sudden sharp noises punctuating the tension, off-screen sounds to create red herrings, and what I would describe as a sarcastic use of music.The entire first half of the picture is fabulously constructed, but as the tale unfolds it all becomes a tad dull by comparison. The trouble is, the thrills of this picture are left almost entirely to the acrobatics of Hitchcock's direction. Other than Walker, no cast members really stand out (although the casting of Hitch's daughter Pat was a nice touch), and the comic relief moments are lacking in the charm and warmth that buoys up many of his best pictures. Importantly, I don't feel we are as able to sympathise with Farley Granger, the way we can with James Stewart, Cary Grant or Ingrid Bergman in their various parts for the Master ? we don't feel that this could happen to us.In fact, because Hitchcock's direction is so elaborate, the whole story, every emotion, every grain of characterisation is conveyed through technique ? through staging, lighting, the editing process and so forth. And within this the actors are merely part of the design. Robert Walker, in spite of his being a bold casting choice, is still really just ticking a box, the right man for the job because he is the wrong man. Still, to say Strangers on a Train is "only" about Hitchcock's direction is saying rather a lot. Here, at the peak of his career, we get something in between the overbearing expressionism of his early pictures and the plodding routine of his later work ? a meticulous piece of craftsmanship, yet still dazzlingly original and visually engaging.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The character "Bruno" is another exciting and interesting Hitchcock creation. I loved Norman Bates, but I think Bruno receives the cake for the best bad guy/psychopath in history.Bruno; A guy who wears a tie with his own name on it at his mother's request. He's a middle aged man who still lives at home with his parents. While this doesn't mean much 'back in the day', people would've just kindly referred to him as an 'indefinate bachelor'. Bruno meets up with a well-known tennis star who he reads in the gossip section of the paper - is having a sort of marital unrest.Bruno introduces the idea of a 'criss cross murder', where two people do each others murders. The tennis star is creeped out and declines such an opportunity. Bruno wants nothing more than his father murdered, so he goes out and kills the poor guy's wife. Bruno then wants tennis-guy to go through with his part of 'the deal'.Things become interesting at this point. I won't go much further, I think I've spoiled enough.Strangers on a Train is a masterpiece. I'm new to Hitchcock - but I'd have to say this film is my favorite of his. The writing is uncanny, the dialogue and characters are worthwhile. Bruno is my main mention of this movie. I'd like to say he's the god of Hollywood bad guys. If any movie villain can pull off the feel that Bruno brings to the screen, I'd be surprised.Go rent this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Robert Walker's performance stands out for me, absolutely chilling</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had never seen Strangers on a train before so when one of the movie channels were doing a Alfred Hitchcock season and this was featured, I decided that I had to see it.I was not disappointed, this is one of the better Alfred Hitchcock films I have watched. I thought it was such an interesting idea for a film plot, Bruno Anthony (Robert Walker) and Guy Haines (Farley Granger) meeting on a train and the Bruno character coming out with his idea of a perfect murder which has two people who want to murder someone in their life and getting away with it by swapping murders so there would be no obvious motive for that person closest to the victim.Robert Walker for me really stands out in this film and I can understand why he got so many good comments for his performance in this, he plays the role just right, not over the top which would have been the easier way of playing him. A few scenes that really stand out for me where you can't stop watching him is the scene where he follows Haines estranged wife around a fair, the way he stalks her, like a Lion waiting patiently for the moment to strike. It was very creepy and had me on edge, wondering when he was going to strike and if he would get away with it. The second scene is when he crashes a party that Haines is attending, while in conversation with a lady at the party about the perfect murder and how he would do it, places his hands around the lady's throat but when he see's Haines' future Sister-In-Law standing behind the lady, he is shaken to see her look like the woman he murdered and he nearly strangles the woman by accident. It is a very scary and shocking scene to watch. I had chills watching the way he looks at the girl while he has his hands around the woman's throat. He really deserved the recognition he got for this role and for me deserved an Oscar.Alfred Hitchcock is amazing at getting the timing right for the tension, he has this nack of knowing how long he should keep the tension and suspense up and with this, he really knew how to keep the audience's attention from when Haines' wife is murdered to the thrilling ending where the old man is underneath a carousel that is out of control with Haines and Bruno fighting. It is brilliant sequence and is well worth watching and I can't see Hollywood making a better version and let's hope they don't try.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fair trade of murders.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What an interesting and suspenseful story Alfred Hitchcock concocted in Strangers on a Train, a tale of two men meeting on a train each with miserable lives and the wish to end them. This film is easily one of the 5 best Hitchcock ever made and it is also one of the best suspense thrillers of all time.Looking closely at it, all Hitchcock really did was take characters that were opposite of each other and play them against one another. For example, the two lead men who meet on the train are almost exact antitheses in character and the way they conduct themselves. Guy Haines, played wonderfully drawn in and withdrawn by Farley Granger, is a famous amateur tennis player who comes across the spoiled and egotistical Bruno Anthony, played totally convincingly by Robert Walker. Anthony wants his father dead so he can get a cut of the family fortune, while Haines talks of his problems with his wife whom he wants to divorce to marry the beautiful daughter of a senator (Ruth Roman). Anthony jumps on this idea and suggests the two "switch murders" in order to prevent problems afterward. Haines objects, but Anthony is not so willing to let this plan go to waste.As mentioned before, by simply playing opposites against each other, Hitchcock is able to build incredible suspense in many sequences. In one, he edits back and forth between a tennis match featuring Haines and Anthony attempting to go frame Haines for murder. Each cut delivers a blow to the audience, building and inching ever closer to the whirling climax, which takes place on a high-speed carousel. Nothing would work, however, without a marvelous cast, and what a cast it is. Granger is the centerpiece, staying true to himself, always playing it cool. Walker gives the film's best performance as a deranged and seriously troubled man willing to go to any end to see his plans done. Roman is the symbol of everything good, always at Haines' side, trying to comfort him. And Hitchcock's own daughter, Patricia, gives a small but very important performance as the other daughter Barbara.Of course, the ending cannot be said but it must be said that this is a pitch-perfect thriller that hardly ever lets up and is filled with fantastic visuals to support it. Some outstanding ones include a shot of a tennis crowd moving their heads back and forth following the volley, but the camera zooms in on one face: Bruno's staring at Guy. It's scenes like this that create feelings in us that make us wonder what could possibly happen next. And only Hitchcock could toy with us like this film does.</fullReview>

But, it could all have been a damp squid if Hitchcock hadn't chosen Robert Walker for the Bruno Anthony role, a smooth and calculating psycho. His previous credits included "Bataan" (1943), "Since You Went Away" (1944) and "The Clock" (1944), but here he really comes alive. The man simply seems to be charisma personified in this film. When ever he is in a scene, your eyes are on him. That is not to say that the rest of the movie is not good good. Far from it, it is a excellent Hitchcock film with other nice performances from Farley Granger, Leo G. Carroll and Patricia Hitchcock (the directors daughter), however everyone is overshadowed by Walker. A most see, if only for Robert Walker.</fullReview>

I feel that Hitchcock filmed the film brilliantly and the beginning only showed the feet lead the pathway to suspense. This film was made better by the 'not killing' of Robert Walkers Father which was previously scripted. This suspense train ride, leads only straight into a classic, and the film sadly not hugely remembered will be passed down from me, for sure. Hitchcock added a feel to this film, by casting his daughter as 'Babs' which i found comforting as i watched, the way that Robert Walkers Character became a silhouette for other 'stalkers of films' to follow in. Farely Granger acts tremendously as the guy who has a conscience. It shows how 'joke's' can be twisted, and that the honest character will always come out on top.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of my favorite Hitchcock films!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Another masterpiece from the great director Alfred Hitchock: STRANGERS ON A TRAIN. I find this to be one of Hitch's most entertaining films. It gets off to its fascinating, titular start with two strangers literally meeting on a train. One is tennis pro Guy Haines (played by Farley Granger in a fine, frenetic performance) and the other is Bruno Anthony (played by Robert Walker in a brilliant performance). Guy and Bruno are both men of privilege, with Guy working his way up to the upper class through tennis and being engaged to a Senator's daughter (played by the alluring Ruth Roman). Bruno was born directly into the upper class and lives with his rich parents in a mansion.The film's catch is that Bruno hates his father and wants to get rid of him, while Guy has a despicable hussy of a soon-to-be-ex-wife named Miriam (played deliciously by Kasey Rogers) who plans to make trouble for he and his future bride, which could ruin the career of Guy's senator soon-to-be-father-in-law. Bruno proposes a plan: that each man kills the other man's thorn-in-the-side. Guy thinks Bruno is joking of course and playfully agrees not realizing that Bruno is deathly serious.Since Bruno is serious, he carries out his part of the 'agreement' and follow Miriam to a carnival one evening. This sequence is typical Hitchcock with light humor alternated with tense and building suspense, until the build up to the payoff. Having killed Miriam, now Bruno expects Guy to go through with his part of the plan and kill Bruno's dad. Guy refuses, but Bruno blackmails him saying that he has something of Guy's (a cigarette case that Guy left on the train) that he would plant at the carnival murder scene that would implicate Guy in Miriam's murder.So Guy 'agrees' to kill Bruno's dad just to throw Bruno off to buy time to get a hold of the cigarette case so Bruno can't frame him for Miriam's murder and the game is afoot. Guy and Bruno play cat-and-mouse game until one wins out in the end.STRANGERS is probably my second favorite Hitchcock film (behind NORTH BY NORTHWEST). It is a very tense, fast-paced film with memorable characters and a really great performance by Robert Walker. Bruno Anthony is one of the most fascinating villains ever put to screen. He is a very prim and proper man, but with a very dark underbelly that just hovers beneath the surface. Look for Hitchcock's daughter Patricia in an important role as the Senator's other daughter.Entertaining Hitchcock film!</fullReview>

And we not only forgive him but we applaud his clever way to invite us for an unforgettable train ride.I saw Hitch's 1953, I Confess, a week before this one, and I put both in the same category as part of his trademarks. These trademarks resided in his genius questioning and pulsing his artistic veins that spills psychological drops of blood on the viewer without leaving stains of guilt, instead very subtle awareness of feeling ashame.The pen is always mightier than the sword and Hitch firmly wrote the most arguable questions with his wrist, and then holding firmly with his hands, he held cameras that always reflected peoples thirst for blood (most humans have), otherwise comedy wouldn't be mostly a tragic thing, and making people laugh wouldn't be so complex.Mixing all dark elements of "high society", with a wealthy psychopath Bruno, and an ambitious tennis player wanna be politician, Guy, the story is one of the most well constructed and guided by Hitch, inspiring many filmmakers, not only with its plot, but with tricky images provoking dark smiles and happy nightmares.Barely perfect!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hitchcock's Coolest Amusement Park Ride</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of Alfred Hitchcock's three greatest films, along with "Psycho" and "The 39 Steps", "Strangers On A Train" is as brilliantly out-of-control as a merry-go-round in Metcalf, and almost as deadly. It's the kind of film you have so much fun watching, you can't even feel properly guilty about it until you have time to catch your breath.Top amateur tennis contender Guy Haines (Farley Granger) meets a singularly weird, louche stranger named Bruno Anthony (Robert Walker) on a train. Thanks to the gossip pages, Bruno knows all about Guy's problems with his no-good wife Miriam, and rather gaily suggests they do each other a favor: Bruno will kill Miriam and Guy will kill Bruno's father, who wants to put Bruno in an institution. Guy laughs it off, but Bruno ain't kidding, as Guy finds out to his peril.It's a great premise for a murder story, and Hitchcock gives "Strangers On A Train" a run for all its worth, with the help of Walker in perhaps the greatest performance in any Hitchcock film, including Anthony Perkins in "Psycho". While Perkins makes his mark playing tetchily against the grain, Walker as Anthony is one perfectly at home either buttering up old ladies at a swank dinner party or strangling a young woman at an amusement park.What drives Bruno? Many commentators suggest his apparent homosexuality finds a match in pretty Guy. Yes, Bruno lights up the old gay-dar, but Guy seems happy enough on love's rebound with socialite Anne Morton (Ruth Roman). Bruno's interest for Guy could just as easily be envy, for someone making a mark in the world while he lives at home, letting Mommy file his nails."Oh, I certainly admire people who do things," Bruno purrs, looking like a cat eyeing a mouse. "You know, it must be pretty exciting to be so important."Later on, Bruno calls himself a "bum", accurate enough except for our rooting interest in him, even as he wrecks Guy's life with his homicidal meddling. It's the ultimate perverse underdog's tale. There's a sense of integrity about Bruno, in his dogged dedication, which commands our respect and which Hitchcock plays to so brilliantly. When Bruno floats away from the scene of his big crime, am I the only sick person in this world who's actually happy for him? I think not, yet Hitchcock keeps the story on a right-enough path for us to realize how low we have fallen. We don't want Bruno to win, exactly, but we enjoy his élan as he tries.Everything else is so perfect, or at least close enough, to make every shot memorable. Hitchcock always managed at least 2-3 good setpiece sequences per movie; here you get a score of them at the amusement park alone. ("20 Big Shows" the neon side at the entrance says, and they aren't kidding.) Script, camera-work, a gripping tennis match, Ruth Roman's jaw-dropping figure, it's all too much greatness for one film to contain. Even Granger does his callow-youth thing here with more risible plausibility than Gregory Peck ever managed.You can call this a clinic in movie-making, but "clinic" sounds too dull. "Strangers On A Train" is good nasty fun, all the way through, leaving you with a nifty stinger at the tail as you realize you were rooting for the wrong stranger all along. Heck, I'll take that ride over again in a second!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hitchcock's Under-Rated Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As I looked at this movie once again, I think it belongs among Hitchcock's greatest films. The first time I saw it I was just blown away by the suspense, action and imagery. It has the gripping ending, the deranged murderer, the innocent man framed or victimized by circumstances, some great on-location shots, e.g. the Jefferson Memorial in Washington and Penn Central in New York. It also has great supporting actors with Hitch's daughter Patricia in the role of the younger sister to Ruth Roman and the stalwart Leo G. Carroll in another of his Hitchcock movies. The merry-go-round episode near the end is one of the most nerve-wracking in Hitchcock's body of work.Robert Walker as Bruno Anthony (his last full film) gives a great performance as the deranged stranger on the train, who worms himself into the life of the unsuspecting tennis star, Guy Haines (Farley Granger). Granger plays the nice guy who is caught up in a messy divorce. The movie opens with the camera showing the shoes of two separate men as they leave their taxis to board the train. Eventually, they meet and the story takes over. The stranger takes an unusual interest in the tennis star and as the movie continues,the stranger becomes a stalker. The action shifts from place to place, including Washington, the fictional small town of Metcalf, the Forest Hills tennis championship, and a passenger train taking the two leading men back and forth on separate missions. Towards the end, the pace of a tennis game is woven into the plot as they race against time. The camera cuts away to the faces of the athletes as they volley and serve in a remarkable series of shots. When the closely-fought contest is over, the climactic chase takes place. Hitchcock has a love for trains and it is great to see Penn Station, long since gone. Trains are featured in the 39 Steps, the Lady Vanishes, Shadow of a Doubt, Spellbound, North by Northwest and this movie. This classic Hitchcock thriller took place at the start of a period of great creativity for the master of suspense - the 1950's and I am convinced that one day it will be given its due in the Hitchcock hall of fame.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Strangers on a Train</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I knew the premise of this film, and obviously I can't miss a good sounding film, especially from "Master of Suspense" director Sir Alfred Hitchcock. Basically tennis champ Guy Haines (Farley Granger) meets eccentric stranger, Bruno Anthony (Robert Walker) on a train travelling from Washington to New York. Bruno talks about a perfect murder, Guy hates his wife, and Bruno hates his father, so Bruno "suggests" swapping murders. Guy obviously didn't take him seriously, until of course when Guy's wife Miriam Joyce Haines (Kasey Rogers (or Laura Elliott)) is found murdered in an amusement park. Guy of course is the chief suspect, and Bruno keeps "bumping into him" reminding him of their "plan", and giving him more things to help him kill the father he wants dead. This murder enquiry and Bruno's stalking are threatening his tennis career, and his relationship with the daughter of Sen. Morton (North by Northwest's Leo G. Carroll), Anne (Ruth Roman). Bruno realises that Guy won't do his murder, so he decides to plant the evidence at the crime scene to make him guilty, Guy's monogrammed cigarette lighter at the amusement park. After his tennis game, Guy and Anne (who obviously found out the murder "plan") race to the amusement park to stop Bruno, and they have a fight on the speeding out-of-control carousel. Also starring Patricia Hitchcock (the director's daughter) as Barbara Morton, Marion Lorne as Mrs. Anthony, Jonathan Hale as Mr. Anthony, Howard St. John as Police Capt. Turley and John Brown as Prof. Collins, and Hitchcock's cameo is the Man boarding train carrying a double bass. Some interesting dialogue and character interactions, some good suspense moments, and of course the unforgettable carousel finale, a good classic film. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Cinematography. Sir Alfred Hitchcock was number 75 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons, the film was number 32 on 100 Years, 100 Thrills. Very good!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Strangers on a Train is about a neurotic rich boy whose father is trying to make him actually work for his keep. The spoiled brat hates his father so much he is willing to have him killed. He hatches a plot to meet a total stranger on a train so they can exchange murders and not be caught. When the person the rich boy finally finds won't take the bate, he pushes the envelope. A classic Hitchcock film filled with classic shots and great scenes. Hitchcock has a way of constructing scenes that still keep you on the edge of your seat even after all these years. Yes, there are many dramatic pauses and corny lines with fast changing mood music to help the scene. No, it is not fast paced as today's films. If you enjoy classic 50s Hitchcock, then this is a great film. If you don't enjoy classic 50s Hitchcock black and white films, then you need to go back to TV.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Its Hitchcock after all!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Strangers on a Train is another in a long list of Hitchcock classics. Liberties have been taken with the original Patricia Highsmith story, but the end result is a taut piece of film-making. The basic premise is simple: a homosexual psychopath meets a famous tennis star on a train. Both are complete strangers with serious problems in their life. One has a rich father who has no time for his son. The others wife is sleeping around + he loves a Senators daughter. The ingenious way to bump off both is to swap murders.From this basic premise comes an amazingly taut thriller with plenty of twists and turns. The camera-work and framing are superb and the visual elements Hitchcock has added only contribute to the narrative. He proves as a director that he was more than just a master technician. He has no Janes Stewart or Cary Grant to work with. Instead he has the wooden Farley Granger, a Grade B actor reduced to working in soft-core movies in the 1960's and Robert Walker, a deeply disturbed man with mental problems resulting from the breakup of his marriage. This would be Walkers second last picture. Both actors fit very well into their "roles of a lifetime", in no small part because of the director.As usual, Hitchcock has a blink and you'll miss walk-on part at the train station. His daughter has a small role as the younger daughter of the Senator. Its nice to see Hitchcock's shoes fetish in full bloom from the opening shot of this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I like the gay subtleness to the two lead characters. Both men ate alone in private quarters but could have eaten with others if they had waited twenty minutes. I think one was more passive than the other, but I think there's a love between the two main characters. With the new movie Brokeback Mountain showing around the world, it's still a pleasure to see gay people in old black and white movies.This movie is outstanding and each time you watch it you will see more. Bruno talks gently to men--very gently--but extremely forceful to women, preferring to talk to men in private.Also, if you really take notice, there's a lesbian in this movie as well--or one that could be.

		<shortDescription>A classic Hitchcock masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is one of the classics that again proves Alfred Hitchcock's outstanding abilities in the art of directing crime thrillers. The story by Patricia Highsmith is also quite original. However the plot would not be half as interesting without the excellent direction and the perfect use of the camera. This is one of the most perfectly produced black and white movies I have ever seen.A certain weakness lies in the amount of prolongation of the plot towards the end. This serves to increase suspense to a certain degree. But Hitchcock goes a bit over the top here, possibly because Highsmith's story does not provide an adequate climax.The movie is certainly worth seeing. I gave it 8 out of 10 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent, from the mind of a non-Hitchcock fan</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In my never-ending quest to see as many quality movies as possible in my lifetime, i stumbled upon this film on cable. I tried Hitchcock three times before this, and never have i felt that the man's work lived up to the praise he had received. I always felt he was good, not great (from what I've seen) This was the best of his films I've seen thusfar. Robert Walker is absolutely chilling, his performance takes the film where Hitchcock wanted it to go. Even an average performance here damages the overall product. My favorite scene was his obsession about getting the lighter from the drain (how exactly does he get his arm down there though?) Bruno is quite a compelling character, but i also loved the performance by Patricia Hitchcock as Barbara. The rest of the Morton family as well as Guy were a bit dry and boring, but she added some flare to the movie, as well as having some of the better lines in the script.Lastly, in any suspense movie, you're going to live and die by your ending. This one holds water, unlike a couple other Hitchcock films I've seen. I truly was unsure of how it would end, which kept me on the edge while i watched and waited.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Hitchcock greats, but not his best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was lucky enough for this film to come on TCM, so I had the opportunity to see it. It's rather hard to find, despite it being a Hitchcock classic. Unfortunately, it also has its shortcomings, some of which Hitchcock has repeated later. First off, the ending is a little too neat and "perfect". In the last few scenes, until the last five minutes, there is an astounding amount of tension; then, the five minutes just clears everything perfectly up... very unsatisfying. The ending is also overly dramatic, for a Hitchcock film. He is, was and always will be the master of suspense... why would he stoop to something as low as a cheap action sequence for the ending? Apart from the few shortcomings, the film is great. The plot is excellent; one of the best and most universal ever. The theme? Simple. You meet a stranger. A perfect stranger. He offers to kill someone for you... you know you have someone you want(if nothing else, subconsciously) dead. The catch? He asks you to do the same for him... will you accept this bizarre yet ingenious arrangement? You're clear of suspicion, and so is he... after all, neither of you knew the victim. And you don't know each other, either... you're just 'strangers on a train'. Brilliant concept, and one that just about every single person can relate to. The pacing is good, you never lose interest or patience. The cinematography is good, but not nearly as good as it is in other, better Hitchcock films. The acting is flawless. The characters are well-written, credible and realistic. Hitchcock uses some of the same elements that he often uses; the dominating mother, the mothers boy, etc. The film is very good, but it just feels a little watered down. It didn't go that famous extra mile that would have made it great. It stopped before crossing the line between what's common and what's daring. That is the primary reason for the film failing to be great, but mainly remains good, with potential to be more than that. The end leaves you unsatisfied and disappointed. However, everything leading up to the end is very good, so the film still gets a deserving 8/10. Good, but not great. Any fan of Hitchcock should see it, as it is among his best... somewhat far down on the list, but still there. I recommend it to any fan of Hitchcock. 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Nothing surprising about 'whodunit' in this Hitchcock classic, as Robert Walker plays a psychopathic nut who tells tennis star Farley Granger his perfect murder plot during a train ride and then assumes they've made a deal.The ambience of this movie is very atmospheric, particular the scenes in the fairground both early in the film and towards the end. Granger might be a bit of wet fish, and Ruth Roman has little to do; but Walker is brilliant (one scene concerning a party and Roman's little sister is particularly chilling).One thing I wondered after seeing both US and UK versions - why were there slight changes between the two? Not really enough to stall you - until the final scene, funnier in the US version - but curious. I think this film is great, however,and it manages to get some humour in as well in the persons of Collins the professor and Hennessey the cop.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Strangers On a Train' is the one great Hitchcock movie that seems to get lost among the other pillars of his filmmaking career. There really is some outstanding filmmaking taking place here with high marks for editing and cinematography. The title "Master of Suspense" is earned with a sequence where a key tennis match is intercut with the murderer, Bruno, heading back to the scene of the crime. Incredible! If the movie has a fault it's that the acting comes off a bit...amateur. And the climax on the carousel (a great idea) plays out a bit silly.

		<fullReview>The opening scene, for example, draws you into the middle of the action with distinct but precise series of shots, all from unique camera angles. We see only what Hitchcock wants us to see. All the introductory images suggest the frenzied purpose, intention, and immediacy of the man boarding the train. We observe the stranger sit down and bump his shoe into another's shoe, so much like an accident, except for the preceding lead-in. We witness the curious eye contact they establish because of an apparent mishap, and feel the alarm for the accident that wasn't really an accident. And so we are drawn into the ensuing conversation without effort, by our own curiosity, the interpersonal tension of a stranger's invasion of another person's space, the smooth and assuring style of instant familiarity of the new passenger, and by the raw homosexual undertones. In the opening scenes, as throughout the entire film, one never knows what to expect. This is an amazing piece of work for 1951.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Hitchcock film...Robert Walker's finest performance...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First, I'd like to correct mistakes made by other "viewers" on these comment boards.Herminone Gingold had no opportunity to "steal every scene she is in", as one commentator puts it. She's not in the film! The reviewer is mistaking Marian Lorne, who plays Robert Walker's befuddled mother, for the other actress.Secondly, Robert Walker did not die from cancer. He died from a fatal injection of sodium amytal by doctors who were trying to calm him down from a highly emotional state. He had problems with drugs and alcohol, was treated at the Menninger clinic, and unfortunately the injection which was meant to relax him arrested his heart.Thirdly, this film is not "Psycho". One of the reviewers writes a full review of the film and obviously thinks he is reviewing that other Hitchcock masterpiece. How careless can you get!!! How could you confuse the two? The very title of this film suggests what it's about. And how did the editors of this board accept that review??? Obviously, it should be removed.Back to 'Strangers on a Train'. It's a simple plot really, taken from one of Patricia Highsmith's mystery novels--and improved upon by the screenwriters and Hitch. A bit slow in developing the central characters, Bruno (Walker) and Guy (Farley Granger), it shifts into high gear midway and races toward a stunning conclusion. Ruth Roman does nicely in a rather bland supporting role but the chief interest in this film stems from Walker's intricate performance of an individual fully as weird as Norman Bates! As critic Pauline Kael observed: "Walker's performance is what gives the movie much of its character and its peculiar charm."Walker himself realized it was a plum role and gave it his all. Unfortunately, he had only one more film to go before his untimely death.Fans of Robert Walker will be glad to know I've written a full-length article on his life and career for FILMS OF THE GOLDEN AGE, due for future publication in that film magazine. </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Master of Suspense does it again!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alfred Hitchcock directs this taut thriller full of all sorts of inventive visual treats. Farley Granger plays a somewhat famous tennis player with political aspirations who is trying to divorce his unfaithful wife so that he can marry a Senator's daughter. Robert Walker plays a well-to-do sociopath who hates his father. He recognizes Granger on a train and after they have dined together, Walker suggests that they should each commit a murder for each other. This way neither murder can be linked back to the person with an actual motive. He offers to kill Granger's wife if he in turn would kill his father. Granger, not realizing that Walker is serious, jokes his way out of the conversation. When Granger's wife is found strangled, the thrills begin! Walker is deliciously wicked as the demented, yet seemingly good-hearted Bruno. The merry-go-round scene and the reflection in the eyeglasses are two to look out for. Another in Hitchcock's "Wrong Man" tradition, the film is a masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Classic among H's Films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A Classic is one without which a repertoire of all-time great films would be incomplete. STRANGERS gets better with age: the more one sees it over the years, the more one appreciates it. It has an extremely special character: a melange of superb vignettes: incongruous yet in continuity. The acting is superb, the cinematography perfect, the 'type' unique in itself. Relax but watch intensely and concentrate on the stream of this Film; experience rather than "figure" it. And, of course, say a prayer before and after viewing it.Patricia Hitchcock, as the senator's second daughter, does very nicely indeed!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another winner from Hitchcock</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hitchcock struck gold again with this dark tale of two strangers - one a famous tennis player, the other a layabout - who meet and swap stories of their lives. Bruno Antony (Robert Walker) is envious of the attractive, popular Guy Haines (Farley Granger), and being abreast of the latest news, Bruno knows that Guy is separated from his wife, but is finding it harder than he expected to divorce her.This is where things get sticky. Bruno mentions that the two of them could trade murders. Guy could marry Bruno's father, whom Bruno hates; Bruno, for his part, could murder Guy's wife. The perfect murder - "Criss-cross," as Bruno puts it.Guy laughs off Bruno's suggestion, but not long afterwards, he is informed by the police that his estranged wife, Miriam, has been found strangled. And Guy, who had a loud and even physical fight with her not long before she died, is the suspect. Not only that, but Bruno keeps appearing... and appearing... and appearing... impatient for Guy to hold up his end of the "bargain".Robert Walker, who would die in a couple of years, gives the best performance of his career as the charming, soft-spoken, psychopathic murderer, easily balancing out Granger's almost-too-good Guy Haines. We don't often see beneath the attractive exterior, but when we do, it's a dark and twisted vision. Bruno is even a literal stain on the landscape, such as in the scene where he is watching Guy from a flight of white steps; he is the only dark object in the frame. In another scene, during a tennis match, the heads of the spectators turn back and forth with the movement of the ball - all except for Bruno, who is watching Guy with a little smile on his face.Then, of course, there is the unbeatable climax, on board a merry-go-round that is spinning out of control. Pure genius. A must-see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A MUST-SEE MOVIE: you don't have to be a big fan of Hitch's to watch the movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, I must admit that I kept the DVD for months on some shelf and wasn't so excited to see it .. a friend told me to not waste my time on it. I was also a little disappointed by Hitch's movie "Frenzy" which was a crappy movie nonetheless. Well, these two reasons made me lose my excitement to watch other Hitchcockian movies. Don't get me wrong.. I liked some of his .. such as "Rope" , "Dial M for Murder", "Vertigo", "Rear Window" and "Shadow of a doubt". I just wasn't in the mood at the time.Anyway, I watched this movie recently and it was indeed one of Hitch's best. In some movies of Hitch's his tricks seem lame and so used ? and that is a good reason to bore you if not running the whole movie for you. In "Strangers" Hitchcock used a strange technique and not familiar to him and it works perfectly ? this movie has an exciting gripping plot which is flawless and so sensible and probably the most convincingly realistic ever in Hitch's movies.The characters are so real .. they are not the usual cast of Hitch's but they did a great job. Never felt that even one role doesn't perfectly fit the actor/actress while watching the movie. At least not the main characters.No need to mention how good the script was ! .. I'm not saying it is the best in the 50s but definitely one of the best. I don't want to ruin the movie for you otherwise I'd have written a few explanations and thoughts about it.When we talk about cinematography ? I may consider it one of the best in the 50s. Orson Welles once said something like "a camera with a director is like an eye in a poet's head" .. Well, mark my words.. you will feel poetry in some certain shots.In the end we got:1. Powerful script 2. Good acting 3. Amazing cinematographyWhat else would a man ask for?!By the way, the music wasn't that good frankly ? and maybe it's the only thing I didn't like in this masterpiece.I didn't read the book .. but if you haven't seen the movie then you must see it soon .. and you don't have to be a big fan of Hitch's to tell you that. I believe that no matter what! You would appreciate this movie and probably love it if you are a movie-lover or a fan of Hitch's. And remember that the little things made the final touches of the movie ? those touches you will see yourself. 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Strangers meet - one is very sorry</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What a wonderful, tense, exciting work Hitchcock's "Strangers on a Train" is! It is also a great testament to the talent of Robert Walker, who came to a sad end the very year this film was released. His Bruno Anthony is brilliant - demented, angry, fussy, charming when necessary, and scary as hell.But there are other wonderful performances in this film - there isn't much point in me telling the story, as many reviewers on this board have done so already. Patricia Hitchcock gives a delightful performance as Anne's sister (well portrayed by the lovely Ruth Roman) and makes us wish she had made more films; Farley Granger, in a role intended for William Holden, is boyishly handsome and likable as tennis player (soon to be politician) Guy Haines; and there are two Hitch favorites, Leo G. Carroll and Una O'Connor, in supporting roles.The finale is one of the most thrilling Hitch ever did, and even after repeated viewings has one squirming in one's seat.I viewed both the British and American versions. The homoeroticism so slightly suggested in the British version was toned down in the American initial meeting of Guy and Bruno by playing the dialogue faster, and for the American version, Hitchcock tacked on an ending suggestive of the beginning of the film, bringing it full circle. I admit that I actually prefer that to the British ending (which is the second-last scene in the American version). But I like the British scene where Guy and Bruno meet on the train better.Actually, it doesn't matter which one you see - it's a great movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cold, Calculated and Fascinating Noir; Hitchcock's B/W Best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Strangers On a Train" is not Alfred Hitchcock's best film. But it is, however, an unusual psychological mystery, fine opportunity for the director to supply many artistic and memorable shots, and a quite suspenseful noir story-line in its own right. It's a clever adventure about a man who cannot go to the police, which endangers not only him but several others as well. The stars of this taut suspenseful tale are Farley Granger as Guy, tennis player and a man who wants very much to divorce his current wife so he can marry his new heartthrob, Ruth Roman. He wants to enter politics; so scandal is an impossibility for him. On a train, he meets a clever psychotic, Bruno Anthony, played by Robert Walker Jr.. Bruno has a father he needs to be rid of, in oder to gain his money and lose his restraints on his wild behavior. So he proposes a solution--the perfect murder, as an exchange...since they are 'strangers on a train' if Guy kills his father, Bruno will kill his wife. No motive; no possible connection; no danger from the police. Guy laughs--until his wife IS murdered and Bruno starts calling, demanding that Guy complete his part of the bargain. There are several great scenes thereafter--back-courter Guy trying to rush through a tennis match at Forest Hills so he can stop Bruno, since Bruno stalking an innocent relative played charmingly by bespectacled Patricia Hithere is a final confrontation on a ferris wheel. The film is a bit cold in feeling to me; but it moves like clockwork; and everything works, thanks to Walker's quirky portrayal of an emotionless killer who gets thrills only out of harming people, or considering how he will do it. The script went through many hands beginning as a Patricia Highsmith novel, an adaptation by Whitfield Cook at Hitchcock's direction, then work by Ben Hecht, Raymond Chandler and Czenzi Ormonde. It was Hitchcock's way to obtain and work on a story outline, have someone else write the first screenplay and then rework it to make it a better shooting script, with or without others' help. The fine B/W cinematography here was done by Robert Burks, art direction by Ted Haworth. George James Hopkins provided the fine set decorations and Leah Rhodes the very good costumes. Dimitri Tiomkoin did the original music. In the cast, Granger does well, Walker even better and Ruth Roman is a strong presence. Patricia Hitchcock created a genuine character. Others in the cast included Leo G. Carroll, pretty Kasey rogers as the luckless wife, Marion Lorne Mrs. Anthon, Jonathan Hale as Bruno's father, Howard St. John as the police captain, John Brown, Norma Varden and Robert Gist. In this film the most outstanding and memorable quality is the detail moments, such as Bruno losing down a grate something he desperately needs, Patricia Hitcock's glasses, Bruno trying his strength at a carnival concession, the moment at the tennis match when everyone in the crowd is watching the ball and turning their heads back and forth except Bruno who is staring at Guy, etc. Robert Walker was only a year away from suicide at this time; but he has enough control left here to do something remarkably well-thought-out. And Farley Granger was never better as a leading man than in this effort. This is an important work, I believe for Hitchcock; a developmental challenge taking him from his B/W period to his larger-scale color works in the U.S.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The trouble with a film like ?STRANGERS ON A TRAIN,' is that from the very beginning I've become aggravated with a supposedly charming, yet devious character. The problem is, he isn't charming, but he is devious -- but not in a deliciously wicked kind of way. Watching him I feel disgusted -- I want the hero of the film to run away, or to report this character to the cops. But this doesn't happen -- for reasons I'll state soon enough.What happens, though, is that the tennis player (who as a celebrity, tries to play friendly with the common folk), makes the mistake of allowing the stranger (who is very obsessed with him), to become too friendly. But he isn't just obsessed by his status as a player, he's also got the athlete's personal life down pack. You see. He knows he's getting a divorce. And the lighter the athlete carries around, which contains him and his wife's first name initials -- the stranger knows what the initials stand for. And I wouldn't cancel out the possibility that he knows the size of his tennis shoes, and where he bought them.The tennis player finds himself in a bit of a pickle, when he sarcastically agrees to the stranger's proposition, that: the stranger kill the tennis player's wife, and that the tennis player kill the stranger's father -- `criss-cross,' the stranger calls it. But sarcasm is something the stranger did not pick-up. Oh no. For a night later, he strangles the Tennis player's wife to death at a carnival.Now, one may think, that once the tennis player receives news of this occurrence, he'll simply call the cops and quickly kick the stranger out of his life, for good. But there's a problem. The tennis player is an accessory to murder. The stranger asks, `Why would I kill a stranger?' Good point. It would seem plausible for a man to kill a woman who denies that they separate. So what must the tennis player do, in order to avoid imprisonment? Even I, who feel negative about the film, will not spoil.But speaking of irony. I often watched certain passages of this film, through the eyes of those who've loved it, and I see a film that isn't so bad after all. That's clearly the wrong way to watch any movie. Then I watch the film through my 18 year old eyes, and see mediocrity.I suppose, that for diehard Hitchcock fans, they see a personal work, which asks the question: `Would I ever kill someone?' and `how would I go about doing it?' This is obviously a question the filmmaker has posed one-time or the other, and I'd be lying if I said that I didn't.But what makes the movie Titanic for me, is that the screenwriter didn't use a more practical. universal situation that would bring up such a question, for every person who watched it -- or anyone like me.Movies, I know, are all about trips to: fantasy worlds, nightmares, and more practical locations. And there are movies that have gone the nightmarish, fantasy and pratical route, and I've loved them. But this movie. This one didn't quite move me enough.For quite a long time, I've been watching a few `classics,' and found that the only `classic' thing about them were their age. Either that, or I'd deny my state-of-mind at the moment, just because I'm not enjoying it as much as every other critic is. But my state of mind is just fine. This film, I'm sorry to say, is very overrated.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Dark, Suspenseful Ride</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of Hitchcock's most entertaining films, "Strangers On A Train" has the combination of humor and suspense that fans of the director love. The wonderfully twisted character of Bruno, played with chilling brilliance by Robert Walker, is a classic villain. Farley Granger looks incredible and, while not ingenious, is perhaps well cast as Bruno's hapless victim. There are excellent performances from Ruth Roman, Leo G. Carroll, Pat Hitchcock and the hilarious Marion Lorne. And there are several quintessential Hitchcock moments: the argument in the record store listening booth and the cocktail party "strangulation" are two unforgettable examples. The film is beautifully shot, but Tiomkin's overly romantic score only works during quietly suspenseful scenes. The DVD issue is superb in every technical way: some scenes are so beautiful, they almost distract you from the story. Side two of the disc contains the British version (only slightly different from the US, but perhaps a must for fans). Extras include eight very well transferred ORIGINAL trailers from several Hitchcock films - they really are fun to see. This film didn't even make a recent Hitchcock "Ten Best" (but neither did "Rear Window"). If you like Hitchcock, do not miss this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A truly exceptional film...with one glaring problem.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Don't get me wrong, I love and respect this film and it's among Alfred Hitchcock's best films. Yet, I still cannot see it as a perfect film because there is one glaring problem. Any NORMAL person would soon go to the police if they were in Farley Granger's situation...and not try to fix everything themselves or hope the problem would go away on its own. And, any suspense film that hinges on the idea off smart people temporarily acting dumb has got a knock against it--and surely doesn't deserve a 10. However, I do need to point out that aside from this, this is a great film. Robert Walker's performance is menacing and exciting to watch--and not typical of the usual film noir or suspense villain. He simply made the film. Also, aside from the brain lapse of the main character, the rest of the script is great--exciting, original and well worth seeing. A lovely film...but perhaps overrated within the Top 250 due to its plot difficulty.By the way, a GREAT double-feature would be to see this and "My Son, John". That's because these were Walker's last two movies and the actor died before completing "My Son, John". So, to salvage the film, a few clips from "Strangers on a Train" were inserted into the second film. Views of DC were reused as well as the final death scene that was clipped and inserted in a vehicle at the end of "My Son, John". Fascinating viewing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can't understand why Hitchcock's movies are so highly rated even when they have major logical loopholes. Look at this particular movie.* Bruno, who is quite smart otherwise, kills Miriam even when Guy clearly has rebuffed his suggestion in no uncertain terms that he won't be a part of the "criss-cross" scheme.* Why Bruno attracts so much attention at the carnival, hitting the hammer and chasing Miriam flirtatiously? * Why did the man who suspected Bruno of the murder didn't tell the police at the time of the murder? Didn't the police question everybody around there? * How did the boyfriends of Miriam leave her alone in the dark for so long on the island to allow Bruno to carry out his plan? From what we saw on the boat, they should be holding and grabbing her.* Going in the dark of the night to meet Bruno's father is also highly implausible. He could simply have called him and met him anywhere of his liking. And while we are at Bruno's father's house, why didn't Guy ring the bell instead of stealing inside with the help of the map? Also, what was the purpose of taking the gun with him? * What was the logic of Bruno's going to the island and planting the lighter, weeks after the murder? Surely the police would have scoured the island after the murder in search of clues, didn't they? Please don't get me wrong, I think the film is a nice thriller and provides good entertainment and has some great visuals. But a great film? Perfect in every way? A wonderful movie to be watched for a dozen times? Come on, boys.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good movie, watch out for the madman...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>** Here be spoilers **Good Hitchcock thriller, but unfortunately not a great one. In this thriller you always know who did it, who's guilty and who's not. The matter of suspense is not (in my mind unfortunately) in the quest to find out who committed the murder, but how the innocent guy struggles not to be framed for it.The movie begin with a meeting of two strangers, tennis-player Guy Heines (Granger) and Bruno Anthony (Walker). During the lunch they share together, Bruno tells Guy that he thinks Guy want his cheating wife killed, while Bruno wants his father killed. Bruno tells that the motive is what really get murderers caught. But what if a complete stranger committed the murder? So Bruno asks Guy if he wants to switch murders. But Guy tells Bruno he is talking crazy and gets off the train. However, later Bruno actually murders Guys wife and now expects Guy to kill his father. Appalled Guy refuses. To pressure Guy Bruno now start to stalk Guy, dropping notes how to murder his father or hinting that he might frame him for the murder.There are moments with suspense, however they are too far apart to make this movie great instead of good. Some scenes in between is just plain dull. For example there are a long scene where Guy actually competes against time by playing tennis. The reason for him to play the match is fine, but it is given far too much place in the movie. There had to be another way thats better in giving the race-feeling than having one playing tennis and one sticking his hand down a drain. On the plus side however, there is the drama of Guy fighting to keep Bruno of his back at the same time hes trying to hide it from his girlfriend (Roman) and her family (her father is a senator, imagine the scandal), to protect them from Bruno and murder-charges. Of course his girlfriend gets suspicious, first if he's guilty and then of who the mysterious man (Bruno) who keep turning up everywhere.The acting is good, both Roman and Granger is good in their roles, but it is Walker that really lifts this movie by his performance of the conniving and manipulating madman. An extra credit for the director cameo too...6/10</fullReview>

Guy is divorcing his wife Miriam and intends to marry with Anne Morton (Ruth Roman), the daughter of Senator Morton (Leo G. Carroll).

This film is still a masterpiece: both the British Version and the American Version (with a laconic end) are excellent. The B&amp;W photography is marvelous.

		<shortDescription>A memorable concept that is well executed by all involved</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Guy Haines is a tennis pro with a lover and a wife who has left him and is divorcing him. A chance meeting on a train with stranger Bruno Anthony sees the two of them get to talking and Bruno rambling about a vague scheme about strangers swapping murders ? for example Bruno killing Guy's spiteful wife and Guy killing Bruno's dominating father. That way neither man can be linked to either murder but both get what they want. Of course Guy leaves the train thinking no more of this babbling fool until, that is, he claims to have murdered Guy's wife ? a claim that turns out to be true. With Guy the police's number one suspect and Bruno pursuing him to meet "his end of the deal", Guy must work out a way out before it is too late.One of the best things about Christmas is possibly the fact that lots of older films get wheeled out in mini series of a director's or actor's work, with lots of the films over a short time period. This year, as with several years ago, Hitchcock was the man in question on one channel and I took the opportunity to revisit several of his films in that time. Having not seen Strangers for many years, I found that the majority of my memories of it actually came from the Billy Crystal film where he references it rather than the film itself; this meant that I didn't remember exactly what happens and could almost enjoy it as if it were the first viewing. As such the film is consistently gripping and enjoyable as things seem to come to a head quite quickly. At the point of Bruno's murder the film does stutter a little bit as it can't possibly keep up that momentum but even then it is still very good.Hitchcock has built the tension well within scenes and between characters and it is this that keeps the film moving along with the unknown resolution. The black and white looks crisp and very clear ? the use of shadows is good but done sparingly, with the majority of the film being very clear and perhaps more engaging for it. This was Walker's last film since he died a few months after making it and he is effectively unhinged here ? appearing coldly cruel and sane while also showing that he is very much off his head! For this reason he tends to steal his scenes easily from Granger who has more of a straight role at the start, although he does get markedly better as the film goes on and more is asked of him. Outside of these two only Elliott really has a large role and she does it well; meanwhile support is roundly good and features a small role for Carroll.Overall this is a great film. For sheer entertainment value I'm afraid that it isn't my favourite Hitchcock but it is still very good and is rightly still held in high esteem. The story is simple but is delivered at a good pace and with tension, the direction is good and the cast are roundly strong even if Walker tends to effortlessly steal his scenes. Overall a great film and one that is definitely making sure that you've seen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Great premise. I had been wanting to see this for a while, since Throw Momma From the Train came out. I rented it last week. Hitchcock is all over the place this month, his 100th birthday and all.Good acting, especially from Robert Walker. But COME ON PEOPLE.A few notes:It's suggested that Guy cancel the upcoming tennis tournament. But no, he's urged on to play. "You don't want to do anything suspicious!" Hello!? His wife was just murdered! Living with another woman immediately after her murder though, that's not suspicious.Guy's being tailed by a pair of cops. When did this become standard practice? And where in the hell were they when Bruno came along? Bruno and Guy attend the same party, Bruno damn near strangles (strangles, gee, wasn't someone strangled earlier in this picture?) Mrs. Cunningham to death and nobody gives a damn!?Guy is playing his tennis match and Barbara goes to get a cab to wait for him. Guy finishes his match and runs to the cab! He looks in the window to the cabbie and says, "Are you waiting for me?" "yes" comes the reply. Now okay, he's a somewhat famous tennis player and MAYBE he got recognized right there but I don't think so. That was just stupid, I laughed and laughed after that scene.Bruno's reaching for the lighter through the drain, full stretch. His fingers can touch it.. he's got it.. NO! it falls a foot further down. But somehow he reaches it! Wow! his arm got 13 inches longer, just in time too!The guy running the Merry Go-Round gets shot and killed probably, the Merry Go-Round goes out of control but the number one priority after the ride is stopped isn't the old man who was shot, not the people who most definitely were injured, it was the two men fighting over a lighter. One of them may be a murderer you know.I can't give this movie anything higher than a 5. It was a good story, a movie with a few extra perks for those who are paying extra attention. But no suspense held me, there was just too much stupid stuff going on.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too many plot holes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a very disappointing AH movie because of many many plot holes. It has very good acting and can be entertaining at times, but intellectually I could not make it through the movie without being frustrated so times saying to myself, he or she should just do this or that, or why did they do that! Because of the plot holes, I could not fully immerse myself into the movie because it was not believable to me. Usually I am willing to give a lot of latitude to a movie and just accept inconsistencies, but this one overwhelmed my ability to do so. I cannot believe the IMDb reviewers, who are typically very astute, find this such a good movie. With that being said, watch it and judge for yourself, you may love it, my wife did, until I pointed out all of the things I thought were wrong with it from a plot and intelligent analysis point of view. She still liked it, but understands what my issues are with it as you might after seeing it as well. I just expected more from AH I guess.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fine story ruined by the bonehead ending.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hitchcock is known for some of the finest, though generally overrated, suspense movies, and his craft is very evident here in 'Strangers on a Train.' Robert Walker, 32, created a superb character, Bruno, which is responsible for most of the tension in this movie. In real life Walker was to die in 1951, the same year this movie was released. The story captured my attention and about 80 minutes into its 101 minute run time I was eager for a classic Hitchcock ending. It never came. Instead we see the police doing something very strange, something that would never really happen, simply to set up a spectacular ending that did not do justice to the main story.SPOILERS are imbedded in all the remaining comments so the wise reader will quit now. Guy is a tennis player, on a train to Forest Hills, NY with a stop to see his estranged wife, to finalize divorce papers. Bruno 'accidentally' meets him, we figure later it was no accident, Bruno needed his father killed and proposed a 'criss-cross', Guy would kill the old man, Bruno would kill Guy's wife, both would have alibis, both could get on with their lives after their respective nemeses were gone, Bruno would have his inherited wealth, Guy would be free to marry the politician's daughter. But Guy is an honest man and, even after his wife changes her mind about the divorce, just to keep him from marrying his girlfriend, he wants no part of the 'deal.' But Bruno kills the wife anyway, at 28 minutes into the movie, strangles her on an island in an amusement park, brings her glasses to Guy, tells him about it, threatens to say both plotted the murder if Guy went to the police, then gradually inserts himself into every facet of Guy's life, and expecting Guy 'to carry out the other half of the criss-cross.'After winning a tennis match, Guy jumps into a waiting taxi, goes to the train station, goes back to the town with the amusement park, thinking Bruno was going to plant the cigarette lighter there to implicate Guy, police are alerted and follow, at dark near the merry-go-round Guy and Bruno are both recognized, and this is where EVERYTHING FALLS APART. A cop yells 'stop' then fires one shot into the crowd of parents and kids, killing the merry-go-round operator, so he can slump onto the controller, it speeds up greatly, kids and parents are crying, an old man crawls under and eventually stops it, so violently that it tears itself apart, Guy is OK but Bruno is badly injured, and as he dies his hand opens to show the lighter, and Guy is off the hook. A completely disingenuous ending attached to an otherwise fine exercise in movie-making.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>good movie til logic kicks in</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Maybe it's just me, but i have never really liked the sorts of movies where the whole plot hinges on someone keeping something secret which need not be.After the first murder, all our hero needed to do was alert the authorities, just say "this guy is psycho - took something i said too seriously" and be on his merry way... because by this point he has done nothing illegal, and the murderer hardly seemed stable to begin with, and not likely to be believed. The concept of trading murders so as to avoid suspicion was an intriguing one, but poorly executed, not to mention that aside from all the easy outs of the situation, our hero was exonerated by the most flaccid circumstantial evidence in movie history. No one would be released completely based on a hankie. The movie gets points for the promising idea, and for inspiring "Throw momma from the train" but it hardly deserves to be on the list of 250 best. Love Hitchcock though.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A curiosity at best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not nearly one of his best films, not even in the top half of his body of work, SOAT is a curiosity at best. A great premise - two men who meet accidentally find out they have something in common, the wish to have someone "out of the way". Sadly, the greatness ends there. The remaining 90 minutes are contrived and frustratingly illogical. Sure, Walker's psycho is interesting, but that's about it. I've seen this movie several times, each time trying to see why other people like it as much as they do. Maybe I just don't get it, because I can't imagine why this movie elicits such high praise. There's no spark of intelligence or insight. There isn't even any amusing banter between any of the characters. Like "Shadow of a Doubt", this movie suffers from a serious lack of plot, bad acting, and careless storytelling.I am amazed at how badly the actors do with their roles: Granger looks like a statue of Gregory Peck on downers, and Roman has but two expressions. Still, I don't expect wonderful acting in a Hitchcock picture - that would just be a bonus. Instead, what I expect is tension, technique, and invention.There are some nice moments: the strangling sequence, the glass booths in the music store, underneath the merry-go-round. But there's no tension. Even the climactic sequence depends on a bizarre, pointless series of coincidences, each designed to rectify the fact that there is no real drama.And just to be picky, I'd like to complain about the, uh... how shall I say this... completely inadequate explanations for character motivations. Maybe in some alternate universe it would be believeable for these characters to behave as they do, but even in that universe this movie wouldn't be interesting enough for me to recommend it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of Hitchcock's best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alfred Hitchcock's Strangers on a Train ranks among some of his best films like Shadow of a Doubt (1943), Rear Window (1954), Vertigo (1958), North by Northwest (1959), Psycho (1960), and The Birds (1963). But this film is much different with it's story but not with it's suspense elements. It tells the story of a tennis player (played by Farley Granger)who meets a psychopath on a train (played by Robert Walker) who each agree to commit a murder for the other person by a method called the criss cross method which is very confusing for people who never heard of it. Hitchcock directs this film with excellence and greatness just like he did with some of the other films that i mentioned in the beginning of this review. Hitchcock also uses a brilliant supporting cast including Ruth Roman as Guy's girlfriend who already knows about the murder of Guy's wife (played by Kasey Rogers who gives a brilliant performance), as well as Marion Lorne as Bruno's mother, Leo J. Carrol as Anne's father who is a U.S. senator, and Alfred Hitchcock's daughter Patricia Hitchcock as Barbara as Anne's sister who witnesses an attempted murder due to strangulation at a party in which the would-be victim is a woman named Mrs. Cunningham (played by Norma Varden). Hitchcock's belief in making movies is a dark way in which you can also learn a life lesson from his movies which is to be more aware of your surroundings.</fullReview>

But that is why it's so successful, especially because there is no one better than Hitchcock to handle this type of film, and he does it excellently. First off, the performance are pretty great. The cinematography and lighting are also pretty effective. I thought the film was going to be more like 'Rope' in which both main characters are on the same term in handling the 'murder. Everything in the film is handled well, not to mention the climax is incredible suspenseful and one doesn't know what will be the outcome. What I love is that Hitchcock isn't worried about ending twists, which makes this type of story satisfying.</fullReview>

Working on so many levels, when it is not symbolic it is masterfully artistic, or maybe understated, then again polemic and malevolent. The story examines a fascinating take on murder and builds it into a thrillingly intense carnival ride, literally. There are so many memorable scenes that it is almost exhausting to watch. Robert Waker was absolutely sublime in his nefarious role of the antagonist, a minacious doppelganger of Bill Murray. He is pitted against the perfectly wooden Farley Granger, the perfect patsy, a stranger on a train. The direction was spectacular, a Hitchcockian classic. The camera does not disappoint, with the most grim moment of the flick capturing the action from a wonderfully beautiful POV. The ending, with the ultimate unfurling, was perfect. Merci beaucoup.

		<shortDescription>Not Hitchcock's best, but still a sign to future success.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is not Hitchcock's best film by a long shot, but it is still most have been a big deal back in 1951. There had never been a film quite like this prior to 1951. It is the kind of film that must have attracted and appealed to a wide international audience. This was a very exciting, youthful, and big production film that came into the fore during the 60s. It must have attracted a lot of attention at the time.Robert Walker plays a very disturbed, yet charming man in some ways. His character is extremely intelligent and extremely disturbed. He is the kind of man who people would trust instinctively until they got to know him a little bit more. Walker stalks a tennis pro (Farley Granger) and in a conversation on the train proposes that he murders his unfaithful wife and that his job will be to kill his hated father.Not surprisingly, Granger's character is blackmailed into "the proposal" after Walker's character decides to actually murder his unfaithful wife. Both characters are well developed. Granger's is a kind and manipulated man with a promising future. Walker's character is literally a "walking time bomb". He is very charming on the surface, but quickly alienates people with his "crazy talk".This movie is exciting. However, there are a few things that significantly detract from the film. First of all, Granger's character is too nice. Yes, he does say that he wants to kill his wife and even has a domestic dispute with her in public. However, he is a very nice guy. It would have worked better if he was less of the nice guy. Instead of being the victim of a psychopath's manipulation, he could have been better characterized as someone who was pretty normal and decent on the surface, but rather amoral in reality. That would have made him make a tacit agreement and actually fulfill his part in the bargain. This would have made the story far more entertaining and morally complex.Instead, Hitchcock settled for the typical "good guy" versus "bad guy". This made the movie seem a bit hallow and overproduced. The ending of the movie was a bit too contrived. First of all, why would the police shoot bullets into a crowded carousel with children on it? This killed the attendant on the carousel and caused the carousel to rocket out of control. The ending was a bit too much of a sellout, where the "good guy" lives happily ever after. Still, it must have been a big deal in 1951. I don't think that prior to this time there was such a big production movie capable of appealing to such a mass, younger audience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Stranger is a Psychopath you haven't met....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Admittedly I still have a long way to go before I can call myself a Hitchcock-connoisseur (more into rancid and exploitative cinema myself), but I can easily comprehend why this "Strangers on a Train" is often named as one of the director's finest achievements and as one of the greatest thrillers in cinema history all together. The basic "perfect murder" outline is simply terrific, the film features one of the most fascinating psychotic villainous characters ever (Bruno Anthony) and several of the classic sequences literally ooze with atmosphere and suspense like you've rarely seen it before. On the train to his hometown of Metcalf, the famous tennis player Guy Haines makes acquaintance with the slightly obtrusive traveler Bruno Anthony. Anthony is a clearly disturbed but intelligent and eloquent individual, since he seems to know a lot about Haines' private life and almost promptly elaborates his plan to commit the perfect murder. He claims that if two complete strangers could "swap" murders, both crimes would appear motiveless and the main suspect would have a waterproof alibi, so the authorities will never be able to solve them. Under the impression that he convinced Haines of his sardonic scheme, Bruno commits his murder (Haines' greedy ex-wife who refuses to divorce him) and afterwards confronts the tennis star with his part of the imaginary bargain. When he refuses, Bruno Anthony infiltrates into his personal life and manically enlarges the web of guilt surrounding Guy Haines by making him out as the culprit towards his friends and relatives.This is another example of a film that almost entirely relies on the villainous character of the story. Bruno Anthony is a truly compelling and deeply disturbing character, and I caught myself cheering for him instead of for the wooden character of Guy Haines. Now, I often root for the bad guys in films, but here the situation was still somewhat different. Bruno Anthony's allegedly malignant ideas, as well as the surefooted and emotionless executions of them, are so vastly ingenious and well-structured that you simply have to respect and admire him, even though he's probably more dangerous than any mad-raving psychopath running loose on the streets. Remarkably enough, in all his evil glory, Bruno nevertheless also remains an ordinary human being who occasionally miscalculates or makes mistakes (like dropping a lighter into a drain), which then again results in a handful of extremely powerful suspense and race-against-time sequences. Robert Walker's performance as Bruno Anthony reaches damn near to absolute perfection, as he's one of the most chilling and stone-cold actors I ever watched on a screen. When I looked up his biography and repertoire on this website, I instantly felt sad discovering that Walker passed away in the same year as this film's release already. Sad, because this role could have been the start of a very promising further career.Hitchcock's "Strangers on a Train" is a full-blooded suspense and action thriller, but it nevertheless contains a handful of artistic highlights that become particularly unforgettable since they depict moments of pure agony and horror. I'm obviously talking about the despicable murder ? shown through the reflection of the victim's fallen glasses ? but also about some more notable Point-of-View shots. Other vastly memorable highlights include the conversation between strangers at the beginning (of course), the exhilarating and adrenalin-pumping Carrousel climax and ? my personal favorite scene - Bruno Anthony explaining to two elderly ladies how murderous lust is a natural sentiment and how bare hands are the ideal weapons. It's a fantastic film, as I think I stated clear already, but in all honesty it isn't entirely without flaws or minor defaults, neither. Some quintessential story lines seem a bit underdeveloped, like for example the hostile relationship between Bruno and his father (the person he would like to see getting killed) and his spontaneous interest towards Barbara (Guy Haines' future sister in law). With the exception of Robert Walker, the only other perplexing performance is given by Kasey Rogers as Miriam, Haines' deviant ex-wife. The rest of the cast seems somewhat wooden, although this might just be one of the master of suspense's tricks to illustrate their ignorance and powerlessness.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just an entertaining thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hitchcock was truly a great director, as is shown in such masterpieces as "Vertigo," "North by Northwest," and "The Birds." Typically, "Strangers on a Train" is also listed among his finest achievements; people will tell you that it's much deeper than a normal thriller because it is not merely a wrongfully accused man who seeks to prove his innocence, because the wrong man knows that he is, in fact, not innocent. If this were the case, "Strangers on a Train" would truly be a great film, but sadly, Farley Granger's performance doesn't allow it.Textually, the film is built around the principle of a doppelganger; two men meet each other on a train, each of whom envy each other. The crazy man envies the star athlete who has found true love and security in the world with a bright future in politics, and the star athlete envies the crazy man who could murder without troubling his conscience because he has an unfaithful wife who is inconvenient to his romance with a senator's daughter. Thus, when the crazy man murders the star athlete's wife due to a mix-up, the star athlete is not completely innocent, because of his desire for her murder.Unfortunately, this only exists on a textual level because Farley Granger plays his star athlete like any wrongfully accused man seeking to prove his innocence. We don't believe him when he says that he could just strangle his wife on the phone; he is too nice to be blamed. The films central struggle should not be the athlete's attempt to prove his innocence, but his attempt to come to terms with his conscience, knowing that, even though he did not murder her himself, it was his murder.I much prefer Orson Welles' "The Trial" to this film. It does not contain a doppelganger, but it is about a man who is arrested without knowing what crime he is charged with, but becomes convinced of his own guilt in the process of trying to prove his innocence. Anthony Perkins' performance in that film is much greater at showing the confused sense of guilt that is central to "The Trial," and that should have been central to "Strangers on a Train."That said, it is quite an enjoyable film, and I would recommend seeing it in spite of its shortcomings.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Strangers on a train starts obviously with a chance meeting on a train who's conversation turns to what it would be like to swap murder victim's with the other man. One has a cheating wife who won't divorce him in order for him to marry his love and the other has a very controlling father who he want's out of the picture. But the conversation is clearly only believed from one side, the side of a clearly unstable man named Bruno who employs a plot to murder the wife of tennis star Guy Haines.From the get go this is obviously directed by Hitchcock as the camera work and set pieces are magnificent. There are a few plot holes though and the movie is starting to show it's age (See the wobbly parking meter for an example) but this is a very enjoyable film with the typical Hitchcock trademarks. The end scene is also very memorable and in 1951 I would imagine was absolutely unprecedented. The acting is also very good and a mention should go to Robert Walker who plays Bruno very convincingly (Although slightly over the top in some instances) I also liked a typical Hitch scene where Guy is on a train and happens to see two gentleman meeting exactly the way he &amp; Bruno met he and he gives a little cringe and this shows you how chance encounters can alter your life or be forgotten forever........but there is only a thin line between the two.Not Hitchcocks best but certainly up there with the majority of them.7 out of 10 - Terrific</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Downright bad performances from everyone except Robert Walker and Marion Lorne (as a suave psychopath and his creepy, deranged mother) make it impossible to care, for instance, about the relationship between supposed romantic leads Farley Granger and Ruth Roman. Said relationship appears to have been inserted in a very artificial manner, probably because a) it's always been one of Hollywood's (nonsensical) rules that every movie has to have a love story, and b) existence of said love story would take the focus off of the much more interesting (and in those days unacceptable) one going on between Granger and Walker. The script is surprisingly lame at times, considering it was co-written by Raymond Chandler.Director Alfred Hitchcock overcame some of these hurdles by bringing daringly close to the fore the homoerotic link between the title strangers, which adds heft to the film. It helps that Walker, who clearly got into his role, isn't afraid of a little suggestiveness. All scenes involving his character are fascinating. The movie suffers from an awkward editing job, but Hitchcock orchestrates many stylish and potent scenes, such as the murder of Granger's ex, the 'pretend' strangling at the party, and the terrifying carousel climax.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** I belive Hitchcock to be one of the great cinematic geniuses of our time. "Strangers on a Train" is no small tribute to his ability to generate and maintain suspense and morbid danger despite a mediocre story.The premise is interesting enough - two men meet on a train and one suggests that they "switch" murders. That is, each one wants someone dead. So man A kills man B's victim, giving man B the opportunity to arrange a solid alibi. Further, since man A has no connection what-so-ever with man B's victim, he is never considered a suspect, or even comes into purview of the investigation. The perfect murder? Could be.The problem is that you don't have two men who want to murder - you just have one. Man A kills man B's victim without man B wanting it to happen. Then you have this mish-mash of "plot" where man A is trying to coerce man B into killing his victim.While the writers of this mess certainly tried to cover all their bases, it just doesn't gell. Man A shows up to man B and says "I've done your killing for you - now you have to kill mine." Man B wants to go to the police - but man A gives the thinnest of arguments that man B would be considered an accomplice to murder. Sorry, even in 1951 that just doesn't work. Also, even though man B's victim is his wife, he shows absolutely no remorse about her grisly death.Having said that, Hitchcock's work is excellent. Like a great paint job on an old car, the film is nice to look at for cinematic qualities, and the camera work and dialog are great. However, if you want a story that grabs you and appeals to you intellectually, then see "Dial M for Murder" instead.</fullReview>

Hitchcock's direction was hardly ever this tight and perfect - it's a huge credit to him that he can make scenes that ought to seem idiotic, and do, when you stop to think about them, as suspenseful as Hell. The reason for this is that he does not let you stop to think about them, but chugs forward like a freight train. Take even the merry-go-round finale - no matter how desperately Hitch tries to play the scene for comedy, it ends up seeming utterly ridiculous. But the direction is so brilliant, it becomes exciting. Eventually, the almost insulting bits of stupidity pile up too high and I, at least (and I do know that many others are with me on this), end up angry. Still, I cannot in any way deny the brilliance of Hitch's skill. I am forced to hand this one an 8/10.</fullReview>

I love the few minutes where he strangles the girl, then afterwards, helpfully assists a blind man across a busy street. The part of Guy was miscast, or not acted believably. Hitchcock has said that he watched this movie with horror afterwards as he had found a short little drunk man to go under the whirling carousel (when no one else would) endangering his life and regretted it always and never again put anyone in danger in his movies. It is not Alfie's best. I gave it 7 out of 10 and Hermione Gingold stole every scene she was in.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This isn't the best work Hitchcock has done. That, for me, is still 'Rear Window'. This also isn't his most tense movie, it isn't his best paced movie, and it isn't his best directed movie. All in all, it was disappointing. What was most disappointing was the horrible acting job of Farley Granger, who played Guy Haines. He was horrible. Honestly, I couldn't stand watching him, and I would have turned the movie off if it wasn't for one small thing. That was the fantastic performance of Robert Walker, who played Bruno Antony. He was a character that was deliciously evil, so to speak. Whenever he was on screen I was glued to his performance. His mildly homoerotic attraction to Guy, not to mention that he is just insane and has gone off the deep end, is played very well and never once over the top, if not even a little understated. If he had a suitable counterpart to act with, we might have had one of the best combinations of leads, or good guy/bad guy relationships that we could have seen. As it stands, however, we have some bad acting and some great acting. The script isn't really up to par either. If you are a fan of Hitchcock give it a go, and if not, then it probably isn't your thing. But just for Walker's performance I would recommend this movie. 7 out of 10, strictly for Walker.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Two men meet on a train. Robert Walker, is a sociopath that tries to talk a popular tennis star, played by Farley Granger into swapping a murder for a murder. One would like his over bearing father killed and the other wishes to have his flirtatious wife done away with. Walker gleefully does the dead and gets angry when Granger wants to back out of the deal that he thought was a joke.My favorite scene is the pretend strangling at the party. The fight on the carousel was a strange and stupid finale, but interesting.Moody and tense. One of Hitchcock's best. Also playing very good roles were Ruth Roman, Leo G. Carroll and director Hitchcock's daughter, Patricia.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Two complete strangers meet on a train. Two entities with different priorities in life. No commonalities, except one - each has one person to dispose of. Why don't they swap murders? Each kill other's nemesis. Perfect plan, isn't it? Each would have unshakable alibi. Nothing can link them to the murders.Interesting premise - isn't it?First day I stopped here ( don't ask me how could I) and let loose my imagination. Next night, by the time I resumed, my expectations from the master of mystery ( Hitchcock, who else?) was at its peak. But, the second part was like having barbecued chicken with risotto for the main course and then phirni for dessert.Its not only that second part was disappointing, but also it has gone to the extent of ludicrousness. I know, I'm taking a big risk of being called naive or inane when I am pointing finger at a movie directed by a person who is revered highly in the directors fraternity, especially for this movie, but I must admit the movie frustrated me that much to worth this outburst. I really couldn't understand the so-called tensed forever-going tennis match and revolving merry-go-round, neither could I understand the logic of the seemingly sane protagonists. The climax was unbelievably anti-climax.Performance of the actors were fine. Even, I have no issues with the direction as well. But the concluding plot - could have been so much better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"We planned it together, criss-cross."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film has a highly intriguing premise, and for about half the film it works. However by the time it should really be getting interesting, elements slip in that defy credibility and work against any semblance of achieving a satisfying conclusion. Probably the most imposing of these is the resemblance of Anne Morton's (Ruth Roman) sister (portrayed by Hitchcock's daughter Patricia) to murder victim Miriam. It comes in handy for putting Bruno (Robert Walker) into a trance at the party as he recreates the strangling, but gee!, why didn't anyone figure out he was a nut case right then and there?Anne Morton attempts to convince Mrs. Anthony that her son might be a murderer - did she really think she could make an impression with that argument? Same story when Bruno tells Anne he's going to place the cigarette lighter back at the scene of the crime. The criminal mastermind didn't really have to signal his intention, did he? And why was it so important to return it at night? The best though was when Bruno asked the amusement park guy "What time does it get dark around here?" It reminded me of a 'Candid Camera' situation where they asked people on the street 'What time is it?' and someone answered, 'I don't know, I'm not from around here.' It's too bad Bruno didn't follow up with the tactic of planting a seed of doubt with Anne, by putting the finger on her boyfriend Guy (Robert Walker) as the killer. Had the film explored that avenue, I believe there could have been a more suspenseful resolution. Instead, we have an innocent bystander killed by the cops (the merry go round operator), and no one really seems to notice. It should be so easy in real life, a cigarette lighter falls from a dead man's hand and it lets the suspected murderer off the hook, no questions asked, just like that, amen.At least Hitch himself isn't hard to spot in this one; he's getting on the train when Haines gets off. As for Robert Walker, I thought he had the perfect "Twilight Zone" face, it's too bad he passed away a year after the film came out.I'd like to be more positive about "Strangers On A Train", but the story didn't really do it for me. Even as entertainment, I tend to view what's happening in a film with a critical eye to see if it passes a credibility test. This one didn't, and it's too bad, as it could have been a much more effective tune up for Hitchcock's later master work - "Psycho".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This Is One Of Hitchcock's Least Innocent Films, Truly Nasty.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You could write a college essay on the criss-crossing imagery in Alfred Hitchcock's 1951 film Strangers On A Train. The film begins by following two sets of shoes as they walk through a train station. One is an elegant pair of spats and the other is a cheaper pair of plain dark shoes. Then we see the train tracks as they cross through a confluence of switches and connections. A moment later in the club car these two pairs of shoes meet when one pair crosses his legs and their toes tap. Even the initial connection between "good" Guy (Farley Granger) and "evil" Bruno (Robert Walker) is made by a criss-cross.This wholly innocent opening leads into one of Hitchcock's least innocent films. With it's startling violence, realistic marital discord, irreverent black humor and not so latent homo-eroticism, Strangers On A Train must have been shocking to people back in the fifties because it can still shock today.The basic premise is that Bruno wants his father dead. Accidentally meeting Guy on the train gives him a chance to expound on one of his "theories". Knowing from newspaper accounts that tennis pro Guy is having problems with his wife Miriam who will not give him a divorce, he proposes that they swap murders, Bruno will kill the wife, then Guy kills the father. By swapping the murders they both get what they want and more importantly, they will both get away with it. Guy condescendingly agrees realizing he's dealing with a nut; but Bruno is deadly serious.So, Bruno follows Miriam one night to an amusement park and cruises her to a lovers island. Then he grabs her viscously by the throat and begins to strangle hard; her agonies visible in the reflection from her glasses that have fallen to the ground. It's one of Hitchcock's most sexy/brutal murders. Proud of what he's done (I mean Bruno, not Hitchcock; or do I?), Bruno now wants Guy to fulfill his end of the bargain.There are other memorable scenes; the tennis match where everybody's head is turning right and left following the match while Bruno never takes his eyes off Guy. The elegant party scene where Bruno demonstrates his strangling technique to near disaster and the finale aboard the wild merry-go-round.The real revelation in Strangers On A Train is Robert Walker as dear, demented Bruno Anthony. Like many a Hitchcock villain, he's intelligent, charming and completely psychopathic. However, in this film, Hitchcock ups the ante; there is no mistaking Bruno's attraction to the lithe, young, tennis pro. As he says plaintively at one point, "But Guy. . . I like you."Still, despite the seemingly great premise, the guys on the TV show Law &amp; Order would have solved this case in an hour. If Miriam is murdered, Guy is automatically a suspect. There are many cases where the real murderer has an alibi. That's because he's hired someone else to do the dirty work. The police are not stupid. Trust me, don't think too hard and you will enjoy the thrills of Strangers On A Train and good luck with the college essay.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mysterious? No. Criminal?? Yes.... But Most Importantly; Not For Criminologists.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>On a criminological point of view this film is absolutely moronic and the plot strings together in a ridiculous fusion. Alfred Hitchcock is heralded as a genius though there are very noticeable and unforgivable flaws in his work. A much superior film he directed is Rear Window", but even in that film he displays a ridiculous plot point of where the girl is saved by the police who show up roughly only a minute and a half after they have been called...... If only In the real world. Anyhow, compared to "Rear Window", this film is very mediocre and frankly it is unfathomable how it reached the top 250 movies list. I do not really wish to divulge many spoilers but the viewer deserves some substance to my criticism.The plot consists of 2 men meeting on the train. One of them a little mentally disturbed who wishes to kill his father and discovers that the other man, a famous tennis player is at odds with his wife. In the end the deranged man has this idea of the perfect murder where each of the 2 men will "do the other man;s murder" problems: When the deranged man murders the man's wife, he first waits outside her house for possibly hours, then follows her and 2 of her male friends to an amusement park, all through the park, ride after ride intent on killing her, and she never finds his presence odd. Finally after getting off the boat ride with her companions the man follows them where she LUCKILY gets separated so the man can commit...... the PERFECT MURDER.... apparently because the 2 men FOUND her body they are immediately ruled out as suspects... Remind me the next time I kill someone to do it in a dark park and be the first one to find them... Now in Hitchcock land the number one suspect is... her HUSBAND, whos only alibi at the time of the murder is a drunkard on a train back to his home in another town... how the killer managed to reach his house to meet him before he got there first I have no idea. Without being able to go much further before ruining the plot, all this time the psychotic man is holding onto the initiated lighter of the tennis player as an insurance policy that he will "do HIS murder" by killing his father, otherwise the psycho man threatens to drop the lighter at the scene of the crime. This is the laughable part; All the while, the tennis player is afraid to call the police on the madman for fear of being involved..... even though he is stalked...... even though the crazy man shows up at his second wife's fathers estate party and nearly strangles a woman to death without being invited. He was even seen at the murder site while the tennis player was far away on a train. But no... Intelligence equals lack of plot in this movie. In REAL LIFE cases such as this, the 2 men would have AGREED to this insane so called perfect murder idea and perhaps later the 2nd man decides to back out. In the first place were it to work, it would be awkward and difficult to maintain no proof that the 2 ever met (as evidenced in the movie).In short; Hitchcock may be entertaining to mystery lovers, but he is lamentable to crime lovers, because here the whole story appears very implausible and slapped together. His only range for brilliance consists of an entire movie centered around setting of a man who can do nothing but look out of his apartment window. (Rear Window) It is very funny to me how Alfred Hitchcock is so heralded because the very same caliber of film made for example by the likes of Dario Argento, today would only get as high as a 6.0 rating at best. If you don't believe me, by all means, view a Dario Argento movie and you will witness no less originality and no more plausibility.... The difference between MORE or LESS, being at a give and take basis.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of Hitchcock's best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Roger Ebert has this movie on his list of all-time greatest movies, but to this day I do not understand why. There is no doubt that Hitchcock was a master of his craft, but directors have highs and lows just as athletes do, and I am not all together certain that Hitchcock was at the top of his game in this movie.There are memorable moments such as the turning heads at a tennis match, when the protagonist Guy spots his stalker as only the one focused on him. Bruno seeing his reflection off the glasses of his victim is a classic scene. And the merry-go-round gone out of control is a dazzling array of colors that builds up real suspense toward the final resolution. Yet despite the technical brilliance of a handful of scenes, the problem that I find with the movie is the weakness of the plot and the relative mildness of the suspense.At times, Hitchcock seems to be straining the film in order make it suspenseful. During one point in the movie, he uses interweaving shots of Guy playing desperately at his tennis match and the antagonist Bruno struggling to pick up a lighter he dropped into a sewer drain. Hitchcock uses music to create suspense with the shots, but it's as awkward as a Wagner opera. The suspense simply isn't there, and the music is being forced to get the job done.It isn't a bad movie by any means, but I consider it one of Hitchcock's weaker attempts because his presence in the movie is too obvious. Whenever the flow of the movie begins to slow, Hitchcock is there to throw something extra into the mix. However, it isn't enough. There are very few surprises in the movie, and every attempt at a twist seems to fall just short of it's goal. I recommend the movie if only to see Robert Walker's disturbing portrayal of Bruno, whose creepiness rivals even Hannibal Lecter. However, for the movie as a whole, I find it disappointing in spite of all the great reviews.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie might not be up to Hitchcock's usual high standards but it still is a great movie obviously.Thing that prevents this movie from truly being a classic is its story, that just isn't always a likely one. The story just isn't always very logic or convincing, though in its key aspects and its essence it still features a good story that provides the movie with plenty of thriller moments and twists, like you would expect from an Hitchcock movie.There are a couple of suspenseful moments but even those moments fall a bit short, compared to some of the other stuff Hitchcock has provided us with throughout his career. It's only the ending that is truly fully Hitchcock worthy and ensures that the movie doesn't end dull. It's also a movie that uses a couple of new and daring techniques, fore Hitchcock always had been an innovative and creative director during his career.It's also not the Hitchcock movie with the most impressive cast. Farley Granger already didn't convinced me much with his acting skills in the earlier Hitchcock movie "Rope" and he doesn't do much better with this movie. He is just not the type of actor you would like to have as your leading man, though Hitchcock must have obviously seen something in him. Robert Walker is much better in this movie and this is the role he would always be remembered for. It also was one of his last, before his early death in the same year as the release of this movie.Compared to other genre movies it's still more than a great movie but compared to Hitchcock usual high standards this movie is just not on my list as an Hitchcock classic, despite having a reputation as such.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Strangers on a Train (1951) **** (out of 4) Alfred Hitchcock's classic about a psychotic playboy (Robert Walker) who meets a tennis pro (Farley Granger) on a train and jokes about crisscrossing murders but when the psycho goes through with the plan the tennis star is left not knowing what to do. What I think is so great about this film is that the premise is very simple yet Hitchcock that this simple idea and makes a near masterpiece out of it. Granger is very good in his role but it's Walker that steals every frame of the picture. It's funny but at the first carnival scene when Walker pops the kids balloon, this small thing seems so striking and perfectly sets up everything that's about to follow. What's so great is that Walker can be so menacing yet at the same time so charming, which just adds to the usual Hitchcock humor. The ending, which got several laughs from the crowd I watched this with, is full of suspense and I think the final fight is brilliantly pulled off by the director as is the tennis match, which proceeds the finale.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hitchcock's themes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is certainly gay subtext in Strangers, and Hitch seems to have believed that he was some sort of amateur psychologist, who had discovered that criminal psychopathology is somehow related to gender bending types like Norman Bates in Psycho, who dresses in his mother's clothes and has an odd relationship with her, to say the least. Here too, we see two of Hitchcock's three themes (as defined by Rohmer and Chabrol in their book on Hitchcock): (1) the influence of Catholicism, (2) the theme of shared guilt, and (3) homophobia and misogyny. The latter two are certainly present here, and there is no doubt in my mind that Hitch meant to imply that Bruno was a homosexual who, like all homosexuals in Hitch's mind, had an overly controlling mother and an aversion to his father. Well, Hitch, in his role as amateur psychologist, certainly attributes homosexuality to nurture, not nature. Hitch was a great master of film form, but a lousy psychologist.. He should have stuck to film-making and left the analysis to the experts.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just like many Hitchcock films, this one seems a bit overrated. The acting overall is good - except for Fontaine, who appears forced and unnatural. The storyline is simple and easy to follow. There is some suspense and ironic twists - I especially like the part when Haines enters the bedroom of Bruno's father.However, I have a few issues that really takes away from the plausibility: Wouldn't investigators take in all evidence at the night of the murder? It would be hard to believe they would come back several nights later in case they missed something as obvious as a cigarette lighter with someones initials laying in the grass.Just as many viewers have already said, the sheriff killing the innocent merry-go-around employee with no-one else reacting is too far-fetched.Upon entering Bruno's father's home, Haines comes across the growling guard dog but magically gets the dog to trust him.Haines plays tennis while Bruno accidentally drops the lighter in the drainage. C'mon, couldn't the writers come up with something better than that? Granted, this movie may have defined suspense during the 50s, but does not hold water by todays standards - think Prison Break or 24.It had one unintentional funny scene: the spectators' heads all turning in unison during the tennis match.Overall an OK movie, but not deserving of a top 250 ranking.6.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hitchcock may be, as I seem to be saying over and over - vastly overrated but no one could say the same of Ray Chandler who co-authored this adaptation of Patricia Highsmith's first successful novel. Highsmith created a territory of her own as distinctive in its was as that of Faulkner or Graham Greene and even Hitch couldn't damage it seriously. Here the premise is ingenious; a psychopath, encountering a normal man on a train proposes that they 'exchange' murders; being total strangers they would, if the proposition was carried to a logical conclusion, be murdering total strangers for which they had no motive. The twist is, of course, that the psycho, Bruno Anthony (Robert Walker) is kidding on the level and definitely wants to see his father murdered whilst Guy Haines (Farley Granger) who does have a wife he is attempting to divorce, merely humours Bruno. From here things spiral out of control, Bruno does, in fact, kill Guy's wife and expects no less in return. For a Hitchcock movie this isn't bad and certainly watchable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A long way from being one of Hitchcock's better films. Someone here said that it was his first "truly" American film (which means ...?); in fact it's ALMOST a first of another kind. It's the second of his films (the first was "Notorious") about which a great deal of rubbish is routinely written. Here's a sample, from Donald Spoto's preposterous "The Art of Alfred Hitchcock":"But the final image suggests things may not turn out so well. ... A passenger across the aisle leans forward and repeats Bruno's opening line in the film: 'Excuse me, but aren't you Guy Haines?' Guy and Ann look at each other and without replying quickly move away from this new stranger on a train. But the questioner is a minister, and this carries an omen beneath the humour. This couple should be moving toward the minister, not away from him, willing to reply to crucial questions of identity and ... [blah, blah, blah] ...The life of order and quiet dignity to which he aspires is in grave doubt indeed."Can you believe it? A rather ordinary final joke has been turned into something positively tedious. THAT'S what we get when the neo-gobbledegook symbol-hunters set to work on Hitchcock: tedium beyond measure. When we hear that Guy's life is a straight line, and Bruno's is a circle, but that Bruno "converts" Guy by inducing him to step onto a fairground merry-go-round ... well, it's hard not to yawn. When we hear that the film has two of everything (because there are two protagonists - get it?), we say, "So what?"; and then, a minute later: "Hang on - no it doesn't." Symbols should, like the musical symbols in Wagner's Ring, pulse with life. The symbols that one discovers in Hitchcock, if one can be said to discover anything as a result of this kind of Freudian dream analysis, are such dull and desiccated things they actually DIMINISH the films.Then there are those who claim that Bruno is Guy's dark side, that Guy is in some sense just as guilty as Bruno for wishing his wife dead, that Guy is really capable of the murder Bruno in fact commits, etc. That last claim is particularly absurd, or vacuous, depending on how you take it. Guy doesn't have a murderous bone in his body. It's true he wants his wife "out of the way"; assuming he can think reasonably clearly, this means he wants her dead; but there's no indication that he wants her murdered, still less that he is capable of murdering her himself. Bruno is NOT Guy's dark side. Bruno derives whatever menace he has from being an EXTERNAL force latching itself on to Guy, despite the fact that they have nothing in common, and nothing to do with one another.Film studies types fall over one another in their haste to morally condemn Guy, but what, exactly, is his crime? So far as I can see he commits only one: he never tells the truth to the police. But he has been forced into a false position by the director. Hitchcock once said, about his films in general, "They don't go to the police because it's dull"; well, in this case, Guy doesn't go to the police because if he did the film would be over. For almost all of the film all we are waiting for is for the police to discover the truth. GUY isn't weak - the plot is. The "strangers swapping murders" idea might be a good one, but I'm not sure a good story can be made of it; if one can be, this isn't it. After the murder things just stall. It's worth noting that the film contains little suspense, and what suspense there is (the tennis match, the lighter-down-the-drain sequence) feels contrived.I feel I've been too harsh. The weak plot isn't so weak as to be no fun at all: Bruno is a fine villain and Hitchcock gets good mileage out of him. And there's some superb photography. The strangling scenes are brashly creative without feeling at all overdone. Overall: nice, but unsatisfying.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hitchcock's Very Best Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Strangers On A Train" is the best of all Alfred Hitchcock's output.This movie is a major improvement over the book from which it was taken.Usually, it is the other way around, but in this case, the movie is a major improvement over the original book.I had seen this wonderful movie at least a dozen times, before I managed to find a copy of the book it was taken from....the book has the same title and was written by Patricia Highsmith.I scoured the used bookstores for years, before I finally found a copy, and because the movie was SO good, I could not wait to begin reading the story in its original version.I was never so disappointed!Not because the book is unreadable...but because Hitchcock made such vast improvements over the book that the book simply does not come close to measuring up to the movie version.That said, let me now comment on Robert Walker's amazing performance as Bruno Antony.This was Robert Walker's last completed performance...he died while shooting his final film, "My Son John," in August, 1951.This role as Bruno was the performance of his career!Perfect in every way.The movie has been around now for nearly half a century. I see it every time it is shown on television, and I also watch the tape I have of it occasionally.Robert Walker's performance only seems to improve with each new viewing.I can not recommend this movie highly enough.If Hitchcock and Robert Walker can read me, up there in heaven, let me congratulate them both on an absolutely superlative job!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of Hitchcock's best.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>WARNING: there may be spoilers in this commentary.One of Hitchcock's best films. The plot is outstanding, even the dialogues are very memorable. Anthony Perkins, Vera Miles, John Gavin and Janet Leigh star in this all time thriller/horror classic. That frightning old house and the motel make the perfect place to set such a mysterious plot where the truth seems to be the only thing missing in this film. The shower scene is really thrilling, also the falling-from-the-stairs sequence, and believe it or not but "Mother's" corpse is really the long awaited CLIMAX of the film (after the shower). This one is deffinately a psychological film. Alfred Hitchcock's best. Analyze Marion's paranoic behavior and Norman's quote "We all get into our private traps but sometimes we can never get out". And when she finally clears up her mind and regrets her act, she just has no way out. Bernard Herrmann's musical score couldn't be better (considering the type of film). Academy Award winner Martin Balsam also appears on this film. Too bad that this film had three sequels, and a remake (the worst). This film was at the Academy Awards of 1960. Among its many nominations are, Best Director (Alfred Hitchcock), best supporting actress (Janet Leigh), and Best cinematography in Black and White.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worst film ever.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've finally given up on Hitchcock, he is to me, the most boring filmmaker I've ever come across. Even watching documentaries about him make me doze off. I recently watched strangers on a train because my house mate insisted it was a 'classic'. His 'classics' are usually borefests, IE: rear window, notorious, sabotage etc. I don't understand the hype behind this man, his films, and i mean all of them are dull, uninspired, bland and just downright boring. In fact i have to struggle to keep my eyes open, even at midday. As a student I've never got so much rest thanks to Alfred. His films are a cure for insomnia. Doctors should have a library full of his collection ready to give out to insomniacs. Along with 2001 space Odyssey and pretty much everything David lynch has made, strangers on a train ranks up there with the worst films ever made in my opinion. And this is the thing, to curse Hitchcock seems to be as bad as blaspheme. When you don't conform to the norm that he is great, everybody's jaw hits the floor (especially film students), and everybody has a pre-planned answer to why he's so amazing. They rabble on about his themes, motifs, range, narrative blah blah blah, but it doesn't make an ounce of difference if his films are unwatchable. Frankly, i don't see what range he has, all of his films are crime stories, and his fear of being wrongly accused borders on obsession. He pounds out film after film about that same crap. For crime films, id turn to Tarantino. Another common statement i hear is that Hitchcock's films inspired future directors and their films so we should all bow down and be grateful to the master. Personally i don't see what todays films have in common with his, they're superior in every-way. I hear that the matrix has nothing on Rear window, what? Are you mad? Matrix as cart-man likes to say, 'blew my warped little mind', Rear window on the other hand, just plain bored my mind. I'm allergic to black &amp; white films. Anything, well before the 1970's is a chore to watch except cuckoos nest. How can you compare the bright visuals of 21st century technology, the CGI, crisp sound and visuals to the humdrum bland films of the 30's. And so my film student friends tell me that its story that matters, plot elements, script, dialogue, structure etc. Yes but its hard to get to that when what you see up there is unappealingly boring. I've read threads with people complaining about a possible remake of this film, great i say, stick brad Pitt and ed Norton in there, Tarantino at the helm, don't think id be bored then me thinks. David Lynch is weird, so are his films, they're incomprehensible and incoherent. But he knows hes weird, he's kind of in his own bubble fleshing out his own odd perception of the world, converts it to film and sticks it in the cinema in the hope someone will watch it. Hes an acquired taste. But Hitchcock is mainstream, in nearly every critics top 5 directors list, named the master of suspense. With very bold statements like that i was expecting a joyride from his films. All of them rated above 8.0 on IMDb. This in my mind, is a whole collection of usual suspects/pulp fiction/fight club/matrix etc all over again. And from the same director, boy what a talent. Not. Strangers on a train didn't register a blip in my pulse. It was a complete non-event. There was not one moment i felt an ounce of terror or suspense. It was pointless, a waste of an hour and a half. And i feel the same about all his films. How the hell can this guy claim to be the master of suspense. I certainly don't believe everyone out there does either. Sure there are loads of people who genuinely adore him and his films, but i don't think I'm alone. Converesely, Einstein is a genius, i know this but i also know why. So do a lot of people. But there are many, many people who know about e=mc2, but don't know what it means, don't know what Einstein achieved and so on. Yet these people will all claim that Einstein is a genius. Why? not because they know it for themselves, but because its what the masses say so it must be true. Now I'm not saying he wasn't a genius, I'm merely illustrating the herd mentality. And I'm positive that many people out there hate Hitchcock's films but just don't admit it because of the mass consensus that hes a great, this is especially true of film students who feel they're doing something wrong if they cant see how amazing Mr Hitchcock is. I've started watching this film 7 times, and fell asleep every single time. I only came back to it to find out what happens at the end. On the last occasion, with a lot of coffee in my system, i managed to sit through it. When it ended i had a different reaction than usual. Usually i shrug my shoulders, and walk off cursing how crap the film was. Then within 20 minutes its forgotten. The film is out of my mind and completely forgotten, cant say that about the matrix. But this time i was disgraced at how pathetic an ending it was. Complete anti-climax. I've seen articles about how Hitchcock 'apparently' stirs up suspense in his films. I read the article, i understand the article, i watch the screen and me no see the suspense. I did buy a copy of this film, and it will forever be at my bedside table, for those nights that i just cant get to sleep.</fullReview>
