		<shortDescription>A fun, refreshing movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay, first of I hate commenting on this thing but I felt like I had to stand up for this movie. So many people were bashing on it and I felt like people who might want to see it should get a second opinion.First off, Bend It Like Beckham is not meant to be the most profound movie of the century. If that's what you're looking for go somewhere else. Just because it is an independent film does not mean it has to be artsy. It's supposed to make you feel good and you're supposed to have fun watching it and those two things are handily accomplished.Secondly, the acting though not "Halle Berry in Monster's Ball" is still good. The movie doesn't need acting like that honestly so don't look for it. It's a family movie. If that's what you wanted you wouldn't or shouldn't even be looking into this movie honestly.Lastly, It has a really cute story. I think it's thought out well and it's entertaining to watch. It's also very true to life for the most part for that culture so if you want to sit down and watch a movie that you can enjoy and feel good about when you're finished. If you're looking for something with deep thought out plot lines and big dramatic scenes this is not for you.-Lyndsay</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Crowd-pleasing Charmer</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>`Bend It Like Beckam' is a heartwarming charmer about a young girl's search for identity in 21st Century England. Like `Fiddler on the Roof,' `Beckam' deals with the painful struggles tradition-bound cultures must go through as they enter a looser, more freedom-loving modern world. The culture in this case is that of immigrant and first-generation Indians living in Great Britain. As with all such tales, it is the young folk who feel the need to pull away from the stuffy values of the past, and who end up dragging the reluctant older folk kicking and screaming into the future right along with them.Jess Bharma is a fairly typical teen with dreams of becoming a world-class soccer player. However, Jess also comes from a very traditional Indian family that believes a girl should not play around with boys, show her legs in public, or aspire to much beyond marrying a good Indian boy and raising a family. We've seen this kind of set-up countless times before and `Bend It Like Beckam' will certainly not win any prizes for creativity or originality. It does, however, have a youthful exuberance and a generous spirit that can't help but captivate even the most diehard, coldhearted cynic. Parminder K. Nagra is utterly winning as young Jess, capturing all the innate optimism and unquenchable enthusiasm of this irrepressible character. She receives superb support from a cast of outstanding actors, both young and old, including Keira Knightley as Jules, her inspirational buddy who provides Jess with the opportunity to bring her dreams to fruition; Jonathan Rhys-Meyers as Joe, the handsome young coach who provides lessons in love along with lessons in soccer; Anupam Kher as Jess' father, who turns out to have some of his own personal demons to deal with; Shaheen Khan as Jess' mother, who doesn't understand why her daughter can't be content with the pre-ordained life her parents have laid out for her; and Juliet Stevenson as Jules' mother, who proves that Indians don't hold a patent on tradition-obsessed parents. In its quiet, gentle way, the film also confronts the issue of racism, particularly in terms of how the Indians are often still treated as second-class citizens in British society.As directed by Gurinder Chadha, `Bend It Like Beckham' is a light-on-its-feet `feel-good' film that never takes itself too seriously. The movie suffers a bit from a sitcom mentality, as when, for instance, Jules' parents labor under the illusion that their daughter and Jess are actually lesbian lovers. The plotting, in addition to being predictable at times, often seems contrived and excessively melodramatic (the rivalry between Jess and Jules over Joe being the primary offender). But this isn't enough to do any serious damage to the film as a whole.Thus, if you're looking for a film that is easygoing, uplifting and comfortably old-fashioned in its demeanor and theme, `Bend It Like Beckham' is for you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow, I can't believe I waited so long to see this film. I just never got around to watching it. The plot has nothing that interests me. I know nothing about soccer (football.) I am one of those American fools that has no clue. I had never even seen David Beckham before this film. I chose to ignore the buzz surrounding this film at the time it was released in America. Enough about me. Truth be told, it was a mistake to ignore this little piece of movie-making heaven. What a fun film. It's full of color and exuberance. I had a goofy grin on my face through the whole movie. Parminder Nagra is so sweet and lovable, you can't help but root for her. No wonder why the American television show E.R. has snatched her up. I have a new appreciation for Indian culture. Those people know how to have a good time. The wedding scenes are dazzlingly beautiful. The only problem I had was deciphering some of the British slang and dialogue through the accents. I turned on the English subtitles to make sure I didn't miss anything. (This is not a criticism of the film!) I'm sure audiences worldwide have trouble understanding the constantly changing slang in American films as well. This is a perfect date film. It has a great sports plot like Rocky, and a strong sense of feminism that is empowering for women. I watched it with my wife, and sixteen year old niece, and we all loved it. I highly recommend it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The title of this film nearly put me off watching it. Not being a Manchester United fan, the mere mention of Beckham was a bit off putting, however I put my prejudices behind me and I'm glad I did.I wasn't expecting much of a film, but I was pleasantly surprised. The film sped along with me never looking at my watch and I enjoyed every second of the film. If you liked East is East then you'll love this film. OK so the storyline is nothing new, and the classic storylines are contained within the film but it's all done very funnily, and with a breath of fresh air. The film moves very fast and keeps the audiance entertained. The occaisional funny moments are a good chuckle and not some poor attempt at humour, and best of all it's a good british comedy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I LOVE THIS MOVIE.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a former 2 time Okinawan Karate world champion, I like movies about sacrifice for sport. But this movie is about so much more. This movie is so good and so deep. I have recently been plagued by very serious injury and pretty much a disastrous lack of passion. Almost lights out for me. And this silly little movie touched me so deep that like out of a daze it reminded me about what life is supposed to be about. This is a movie about living. Living your life for yourself and respect for others. Empowerment. God, bless "Bend it like Beckham" I believe it is a true gem.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mississippi Masala meets Chariots of Fire</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie might best be characterized as a collection of formulas - underdog sports flick, culture clash flick, generational conflict flick, young-love-overcomes-obstacles flick. The setting of transplanted Indian-ness makes it feel like one of Mira Nair's films - `Monsoon Wedding' or `Mississippi Masala.' There's also quite a bit of youthful, flippant, foul-mouthed, blue-collar London impertinence going on - an episode of `Eastenders,' perhaps.And yet to dismiss the movie with this quick sketch and a few references would do it a terrible injustice. OK, no, it is perhaps not `great.' It's a feelgood movie, and while it dips a bit into serious subject waters, it doesn't stay down too long. And, it really IS a collection of all these movie formulas - and, I submit, they do exactly what they're intended to do. It's ALMOST too much, but it's not. The formulas lead to their inevitable pay offs, of course, but they pay off in ways that are not quite expected. The final outcome is rarely in doubt, but throughout the twists and turns, the audience (at least the audience where I was watching), find themselves shamelessly twisting their hankies on the sidelines, crying just a little where they're supposed to cry, and cheering when they can't but cheer. There is a point at which you want to stand up and clap wildly - it's not at the end, so you can't, but the audience where I saw it sure wanted to. I think they felt a little cheated that they couldn't. The mood of the end is not one conducive to raising the rafters, but many clapped softly anyway. Granted the movie isn't timed quite right, but it really IS that good - it makes you want to show your gratefulness for the efforts of writer, director, and actors.Any flaws of timing or plausibility I find I can easily forgive due to the overwhelming charm of the movie's star, Parminder K. Nagra. Her expressions, her boundless energy and defiance, her ability to convey the conflict her character feels between duty to family and wishing for something more - I was completely taken in, from start to finish. This actress is going places. She has the kind of playful wit and irreverence you see in the best early John Cusack, coupled with a depth to play convincing disappointment and struggle. If you love `Say Anything,' with the passion that most true devotees, including me, do - you will love this film. In fact, if `Say Anything' is your favorite film, drop whatever you're doing and RUN out to see this film, before it leaves theatres. Drive 100 miles if you have to. It has that same magic.It doesn't hurt that Ms. Nagra possesses a true, deep, classic beauty and grace akin to that of, say, a Kelly or a Bergman. I mean, my fellow red-blooded males, this woman is flat-out, drop-dead stunning. She's equally fetching as a feisty tomboy jock (my personal preference) or as an elegant, traditionally clad Sikh woman. Go see it to watch her, even if the subject matter isn't your thing.It is perhaps not a great movie, but it's one that will, due to its sheer quirkiness and great heart, likely find its way onto the `favorites' shelves of many, and not just young girls aspiring to make it big and become soccer stars. Evidently the movie is a huge hit in England and Germany, and Parminder is well on her way to becoming a superstar. Go out and see what all the fuss is about.P.S. I must beg to differ with the reviewer who claims that women's soccer is not big in the U.S. Women's soccer is HUGE in the U.S. - there are perhaps ten times as many young women playing soccer in America as in the whole of Europe. The U.S. national team is THE powerhouse international women's team, and has been for almost a decade. Brandi Chastain's shirt-removing gesture in the 1999 Women's World Cup, which graced the cover of Time, Newsweek and Sports Illustrated, has become iconic. Young women from around the world most certainly DO aspire to be on American college teams - North Carolina and Santa Clara, I believe, particularly. American Mia Hamm, far and away the greatest women's player of all time, dominates the sport like a Michael Jordan. I'm fairly sure the U.S. is the only country to have a professional women's soccer league (maybe Japan as well?). This film is fully aware of this. If girls' soccer coaches from age five on up don't make this film required viewing for their team, they should consider leaving coaching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No pact with the devil here</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My scalp still smarts from the burning coals heaped on it when I vowed I love this film. Bring on the coals; I'll walk over them as well to say again that I love "Bend it Like Beckham." Granted, there's a lot of "in spite of" in that confession. It's a bit movie-of-the-week; the screenplay is on the paint-by-numbers side. And, most troublingly, the director's commentary implies that in this film beauty can be found primarily amongst the white of skin.The film's genius is not in what's obvious to the Syd Field-doctored eye: character arcs, themes, construction. It's in both the surface and what lurks deep beneath, but not in those layers of artistic topsoil that reviewers seem most often to scratch at. Powerful, sometimes semi-clad female bodies not simply on display but kicking the crap out of a football do a better job of naturalizing female strength and agility than Lara Croft or Zhang Ziyi will ever do. These are real bodies (Keira Knightley's excepted) whose work is not to look great first and kick butt later. They are working bodies whose beauty is in their movement and self-determination. And, in my book, lead actress Parminder Nagra is one of the most gorgeous creatures ever captured on screen ? not only because she can lay claim to that hackneyed adjective, "luminous," but because her performance has an honesty and un-bookish intelligence that's utterly compelling.The result is a film women can enjoy without feeling like they're making a pact with the devil to do so. As in Chadha's "Bride and Prejudice," the relationships amongst women sizzle with a chemistry that can't be neatly slotted into the stodgy, Sweet Valley High categories of "best friends" or "sisters." Perhaps Chadha is even right in her commentary to disavow the film's flirtation with lesbianism. "Bend it Like Beckham" has an electricity that can't be reduced to the simple hetero/homosexual love triangle its conventionally structured script would suggest. The precise nature of its pleasure is, ultimately, a bit of a mystery ? and is all the more seductive for it.Oh yes, and did I mention that it's hilarious?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As someone who's never been into sports, it seems like it would be hard for me to get into the football (or as we Americans inexplicably call it, soccer)-themed "Bend It Like Beckham". But I gotta say, this was one cool movie! Anglo-Indian Jesminder Bhamra (Parminder Nagra) and her WASP friend Juliette Paxton (Keira Knightley) love to play football (yes, I'm going to say it the British - and international - way) and just adore football player David Beckham. But Jesminder's traditional Sikh parents don't approve (her mother offers a really whacked-out description of football early in the movie). Okay, so maybe it was sort of a cliché in that sense, but you gotta love this movie! And if like me, you go to this movie not knowing the definition of "bend" in football...don't worry, the movie explains it (I'd also never heard of David Beckham prior to this movie). And we all know that Keira Knightley hit it big: a few months after "BILB" came out in the States, she starred in the equally cool "Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So much more than you'd expect!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As an anti-football person, I (on the surface) grudgingly took my younger brother to see this film, although secretly I hoped it might be East is East II. The trailers looked fun so I thought I'd give it a go.It took about ten minutes but after that I was glued to the screen, and that wasn't anything to do with the neck cramp caused by sitting too near the front due to a packed auditorium. The acting was fresh and vibrant, the characters engaging, and the jokes genuinely funny. The entire auditorium was laughing out loud every minute or so. Football fan or no football fan, sport became irrelevant to the main principles of love, friendship, family, independence and rivalry. Add a dash of Sikh culture and you have the formula for the best British comedy I've seen in a long time, dare I say it.... better than East is East.This film trots along nicely at a lovely pace, never dwelling on anything longer than necessary nor leaving anything unfinished, keeping the viewer entertained and mentally engaged. Though not a characteristically twisting-and-turning film, there are some pleasant surprises on the way and things don't always happen as you would expect.Saying that, there were elements of predictability but these were exploited satirically more than used as script-fillers. I suppose depending on your particular penchant for happy-endings you could be either delighted/let down by the ending. Personally, if there was any other outcome I would have written a strongly worded letter to the script writers.As for the actors, I would have to say that Juliet Stevenson (Paula) put in the finest performance. I never knew that people like that existed but she her realism with sometimes bizarre concepts has convinced me that they possibly do! Prize for the most unconvincing (of the main characters) goes, unfortunately, to Kiera Knightley (Jules), but don't get me wrong, even she offered a great performance, it's just that someone has to be last of the best and sorry Kiera, this time you're it.Tip: Don't leave before the credits. Once the lights came back up I realised to my horror that perhaps I shouldn't have watched this film after all. My beloved but forgotten Ice Junkie had melted into a sugary blue juice. Oh, what am I saying, it was absolutely brill and I can't recommend it enough. I will definitely buy it when it comes out and add it to my collection of 3 videos. I'm a student. I only splash out if it's really worth it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>***There are spoilers in this review***Like most Americans, I don't like soccer and had no idea who Beckham was before this film, but this is a thoroughly enjoyable coming-of-age movie. If there is one lesson that people should take away from this film, it is this: follow your dream.Pounding music underscores the action sequences as the main character, Jess, rebels against her family and her culture. The film continuously pushes Jess to the edge, culminating in an unapproved trip to Germany, and by that point it's clear to the family that Jess has soccer in her blood. The humor sequences are a little disappointing, tending to rely on mistaken impressions about sexuality and ignorant sheltered housewives. However, the acting is first-rate all around. I had a terrible time understanding the heavy British accents and British slang.In our house, a good film will usually create a catchy metaphor. We now use the phrase "full Punjabi meal" as a euphemism to indicate something particularly difficult.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love playing football and I thought this movie was great because it contained a lot of football in it. This was a good Hollywood/bollywood film and I am glad it won 17 awards. Parminder Nagra and Kiera Knightley were good and so was Archie Punjabi. Jonathon Rheyes Meyers was great at playing the coach. Jazz (Parminder Nagra) loves playing football but her parents want her to learn how to cook an want her to get married. When Jazz starts playing for a football team secretly she meets Juliet (Kiera Knightlety) and Joe (Jonathon Rhyes Meyers) who is her coach. When her parents find out trouble strikes but her dad lets her play the big match on her sisters Pinky (Archie Punjabi's) wedding. At the end her parents realise how much she loves football and let her go abroad to play.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>''Bend It Like Beckham'''is quite a nice movie. I mean,it's not a masterpiece like ''BraveHeart'' or ''Schindler's List'', but it's good. The story is simple, about an Indian girl called Jesminder Bhamra who is supposed to be doing 'female things'like helping her mother to cook or thinking about her wedding, but what she really likes is to play soccer. Not to mention that living in London, her soccer idol is David Beckham. Jesminder and Juliette start to be friends since both girls have many things in common. Or should I say way too much in common,when it has to do with the couch? Of course we do have many stereotypes in this movie,like Jesminder's family, but we cannot forget that even in the present days is quite common to have many conservative people and families.I really liked the ending, and I didn't expect that the couch would really have that big interest for Jesminder, what, in my opinion,makes the movie cooler.

Since Liverpool and Man Utd are rivals, i was DEAD sure that i wouldn't watch the film.But then i was in delhi to meet some friends, and i had an early morning flight, so i thought, "what the heck, let's bide time by watching this film", 'cos it was a late night show.What a moron i was. I should've seen this film the day it was released. I guess using Beckham's name was to draw audience attraction (which had back-fired in my case!!!), but then i really can't think of a better title for the film.And Nagra, Knightley (drop dead gorgeous), and Rhys-Myers did a superb job.If you hate football, dislike Manchester United (or England for that matter), then this is DEFINATELY the film for you. In fact, i'm just 29 yrs old, a psychiatrist by profession, but a kid at heart. This film has knocked "Star Wars" off my no.1 position.Surprisingly, there aren't very many comments on this film by indian-brits like me. I wonder why?10/10 for this film.</fullReview>

Apparently most cultures don't want their daughters to be small-breasted, either. Here we see a bunch of superb actors we've never heard of before portray folks of different cultures living fairly humdrum lives until their female children want to, and have the potential to, become professional soccer players. The structure around the parallelism of the two cultures is wonderful. There is no condescension. Both cultures are seen as modern and valid. (And yes, both are silly, too). One flaw: the Hindu wedding ceremony seemed to involve hundreds of relatives but not one child among them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good performances save this trite story placed in the Indian community of London.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This story would never have made it into a widely distributed film except for the fact that the main character is a young Indian lady in contemporary London. The performances of the three youths make the film enjoyable to watch but the story is totally predictable and the direction mediocre if not annoying. There are too many filler scenes with pop song backgrounds that add nothing to the plot. The final scenes of the wedding party are particularly obnoxious and I believe insulting to the Indian culture. The final shots during the credits played to the awful song "Hot, Hot, Hot" might be the lowpoint of any of the films that I have seen this year. Perhaps I have been on too many cruises where that song is overplayed night after night.Saying all that, Parminder Nagra is a delight to watch and her performance lifts the movie above the banality of its plot. I hope to see more of her in future roles, hopefully with better scripts and direction.If this movie is at all similar to "My Fat Greek Wedding", I am very glad that I did not see it.My rating is 5.5 stars but Imdb only allows me to vote 5 or 6. I voted 5 to counterbalance (in a very small way) all the 7's and 8's that it is receiving.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Highly overrated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I finally saw this movie on DVD the other day and I was greatly disappointed considering what I've heard of it. Sure, there were charming moments, like the Babaji thing and many other Indian-vs-British things, Jules' mother was hilarious, and Parminder Nagra was acting convincingly, but that was it.The story was utterly predictable and ALWAYS followed the clichés. That isn't always a problem if the rest of the movie is charming enough, which I thought it would be, but it wasn't. Despite the good acting of some people, among which Parminder Nagra who I already mentioned, Anupam Kher, Ameet Chana and Juliet Stevenson, the acting skills of others were making me wonder how they could make a living as actors. Oh well, I suppose Keira Knightly has her looks and she shows off plenty of body parts to make the male audience drool (if they like near-anorectic girls). I gave her another chance with this movie after being impressed with the absence of any acting skills in Pirates, but this movie showed I was right in my judgment. Jonathan Rhys-Meyers' acting was as natural as banana bubblegum. He must have read his lines off some board! He would have fitted perfectly in 'Days of our Lives' the way he was overacting every feeling and gesture.Anyway, this could have been an okay movie had the acting been better and had I not had these expectations. I can't believe this movie's rating is 7.4. I can't give more than 5 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Entertaining and well worth watching if not for Archie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie kept me entertained throughout and was very funny in parts. As a British born Punjabi, I could identify with key points and loved the odd moments of hysteria (spoken in Punjabi) by Jess's mother, Mrs Bhamra - boy have we all been there, "Ohh Baba-ji ...". The determination by the young football player to forge a career in a non traditional Asian occupation was inspiring and our hearts went out to the poor girl. Parminder Nagra was well supported by Archie Punjabi who is gorgeous, articulate and highly talented - what a babe - I think I'm in love! Anupam Kher (Mr Bhamra), a well respected Bollywood star helped to make this movie enjoyable but I don't think his real skills were exploited in this movie. Nevertheless, I would recommend this movie to most people but a must for young Asians living in a western society, as well as their parents of course. Both could learn a lot from each other. Music was great too - Loved the wedding bits, just brought back memories for me - You just can't beat a Punjabi Wedding - thumping Bhangra beats just get my shoulders going. Well done to all those that were involved - you certainly made me proud.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great family movie introducing Keira Knightley</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jess (Parminder Nagra) comes from a conservative Sikh family. Her mother worries about her daughters and maintaining a good family facade. Her sister is getting married, but her mind is on football. Jules (Keira Knightley) plays on a girls team, and recruits Jess after watching her in the park. Jess starts playing despite her family's misgiving.This is Keira Knightley's big break out indie hit. It's the start of her wider fame. But it's Parminder as Jess and her family that is more fascinating. The family traditions and pressures are at the heart of this movie. The one false note in the movie is the girlie drama with Jules getting jealous of Jess and couch Joe. It reeks of lesser teen fare. But the movie gets over it quickly and moves on. It gets back on firmer ground of family drama. This is a heart warming little film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The premise was intriguing, if trite. Girl wants to play soccer, traditional family refuses, girl runs off and does it anyway. Unfortunately, the execution was mediocre and we only saw part of the movie.The very beginning was amusing. We see a televised soccer match with David Beckham on the team, there is trouble getting the ball through, and suddenly a female player gets the ball and scores an unlikely goal, to the world's adulation. Well, except for when several sports commentators talk to the girl's mother, who is critical of her being in the soccer game in the first place and showing her legs to thousands of people. It was the girl's imagination, of course-and real life intrudes when she is called down to deal with preparing for her sister's upcoming wedding.Unfortunately, then comes a bunch of shouting back and forth, clichéd and not well-acted. A standard clash of Indian and English cultures, and it quickly got tedious, so we gave the rest a miss. The idea could have been done much better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bend It Is Great Fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sports movies are often predictable and enjoyable, but they are not always as fun as Bend It Like Beckham. I'm certainly no soccer fan, but Parminder Nagra completely won me over as the young girl Jess, who is trying to simultaneously pursue her dream of playing soccer and appease her traditional Indian parents. She is befriended by the gawky Keira Knightley, who recognizes the potential Jess has. Nagra accurately portrays the typical naiveté of someone with controlling parents, unsure of her own abilities. Nagra is believable and sensitive in her starring role. Knightley is used in support here, but she is equally as good. Both girls' mothers are caught up with traditional ideas of what their daughters should or shouldn't do, and this provides the comic fodder for the audience to feed upon. Here the fathers are the rational parents instead of boobs, which is otherwise too often the case in these kind of movies. Juliet Stevenson is hilarious as Knightley's well-meaning but idiotic mother who jumps to one conclusion too many. Jonathan Rhys-Meyers plays the girls' soccer coach with his own parental demons. The film is co-written and directed by Gurinder Chadha, and it's a lot of fun. *** of 4 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Immerse yourself in some culture; this is a delight to watch.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A healthy mixture of culture, social issues, friendship, romantic love, and passion for sports. This movie has it all. Jess is Indian and her parents are counting on her to be the family's next solicitor but she has a passion for football and her parents won't allow her to follow her dreams. This movie uses football as a device to discuss some concerns in society like racism and a bit of sexism but apart from that, it is also used to carry that undying message of chasing your ambitions to gain happiness. Parminder Nagra is a delight to watch on screen alongside Keira Knightley. This movie is unexpectedly marvelous; you won't ever regret seeing it. From British director Gurinder Chadha, this is a charming uncomplicated story told in a rather realistic way. It is funny, fulfilling, and absolutely fantastic. Do yourself a favor, immerse yourself in a little culture and pick this movie up. Swear to Guru Nanak you won't be disappointed!http://iwascalledclementine.multiply.com/reviews</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Enjoyed this film concerning a girl eighteen years of age who has become interested in a girls soccer team which is called football in West London, England where this film takes place. This young girls name is Jess Kaur Bhamra, (Parminder Nagra) who is the daughter of an East Indian father who practices the orthodox Sikh faith. Jess meets up with a girl named Juliette Paxton, (Keira Knightley) who plays on a girls soccer team and invites Jess to come on their team and she meets the male coach of the girls team, who is Joe, (Jonathan Rhys). Jess shows she has great talent and is accepted on the team. However, her family is very much against their daughter participating in any sports and therefore, Jess decides to keep it a secret until she goes to Germany for a soccer event. There is plenty of comedy, drama and romance and a wonderful experience of seeing the customs of East Indian people and all the foods that they prepare for themselves as a family. Great entertaining film and a wonderful production. Enjoy</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant soccer dream showing...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After seeing this picture for the first time, I really enjoyed much more the sport of football(soccer) and also the Hindu culture. My hat has to go off directly to director Gurinder Chandra for making a movie connecting soccer and Hindu religion especially since cricket is the number one sport to most people in India or Asia. Parminder Nagra's performance as Jess Bamra was a brilliant way to make her famous on TV and screen. The way she loved football behind her parent's back seemed humorous at the beginning though it nearly cost her relation with her family. Keira Knightly was nearly perfect as her friend Jules and on the field as one of the few women I seen at their best when in action. Anyone who loved this film a sports should might also want to see the Hindu movie "Lagaan" in subtitles, or Little Giants(1994)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nice coming of age story with some cute moments.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was an enjoyable film to watch but nothing I feel compelled to add to my collection. It's certainly not the toe-tapper that director Gurinder Chadra's "Bride &amp; Prejudice" is, but then I may be biased since I am really quite averse to most sports-oriented/coming of age films to begin with. The most enjoyable portions for me were: 1. Seeing the girls' skills ? with the exception of Parminder, Keira Knightley &amp; Shaznay Lewis, the rest of the girls were serious players - &amp; even the actresses did a great job on the field. 2. Juliet Stevenson as Keira's mum ? hysterical. Anupam Kher as Parminder's father - heartwarming &amp; believable. Not that the rest weren't believable in their roles but many of them seemed a bit over the top/stereotypical/flat to me. 3. Seeing the introduction of Indian Sikh culture as expressed in a second-generation family facing modern realities in England. Just seeing this on screen is important, IMHO.Being as this is near the beginning of Gurinder's directing career, the film is still a bit disjointed. Much of the movie tugs away from the main story to seem more like her personal platform to put a spin on her personal history, introduce her own culture to a new audience, show that people (regardless of culture) really aren't that different, &amp; haul in her relatives to have fun than a contribution to the overall whole. For example, the fight scene at the wedding didn't contribute anything to the storyline &amp; really should have been edited out. On the other hand, Gurinder's tendency to give the actors a long leash ended up bringing in the parallels between the discrimination Parminder's character faced as an Indian &amp; Sikh &amp; those her coach must have faced as an Irishman in England as well as a more personal side of Parminder as she explains how she ended up with the horrific RL burn on her thigh which adds depth to her character and draws the viewer closer to the actress and overall story.It was fun to see that the actors, crew &amp; Gurinder's family had fun on the project but it's not a film I feel overly compelled to watch again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Eight? Eight for a predictable sports-based movie where the lead overcomes every obstacle thrown at her and triumphs at the end just like every other sports-based movie? Have I gone mad? Well, no actually because although "Bend It Like Beckham" is as original as a boy-band cover version, it is still a surprisingly enjoyable film which somehow manages to avoid becoming another chick-flick cliché. A solid cast add to the mix but while there are plenty of goals, there are still one or two holes at the back which threaten the side. Incidentally, whenever I talk about football, I refer to soccer in case any US readers get confused.Parminder "ER" Nagra plays Jess, a rebellious daughter in a strict Indian family living in London. Obsessed with football star David Beckham and possessing more skills on the pitch than she realises, she is spotted by another female footballer Jules (a very young-looking Keira Knightly) who persuades her to try out for a local football team, the Hounslow Harriers. Keeping her place in the side a secret from her family, she struggles with the gaping chasm in culture as well as her feeling for her coach Joe (Jonathan Rhys Meyers). As her sister's wedding day approaches and the resentment from his disapproving parents (Anupam Kher and Shaheen Khan) grows, can she develop her skills further and secure her dream of playing professionally in the US?Like I said, there is nothing shocking and surprising about the screenplay which manages to throw in every conceivable barrier for our hero to overcome. And despite the creaking plot, the story is enlivened by quality performances throughout. Nagra and Knightley are fantastic but Meyers lets the side down a bit. There is also a surprising amount of humour which is genuinely amusing, particularly from Knightley's mother (Juliet Stevenson) who worries excessively that her daughter is a closet lesbian. The clash of cultures does offer a unique perspective as far as sports movies go but it isn't much to offer the casual movie fan.But that's the thing with sports movies - no matter how impossible victory looks or how many obstacles you put in front of the hero, you still watch them to see the hero overcome it all and bask in the glory they richly deserve. You already know how the movie will end but that doesn't stop you enjoying it - a philosophy that surely led to Sylvester Stallone making "Rocky Balboa" recently. The fact that the hero in "Bend It Like Beckham" is a cute Indian girl instead of a sixty-year-old meat head means that this is not your typical sports movie. Instead of guts and sweat, it has heart and brains and it's that which gives this film its rating. See, I haven't gone mad...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Everything works out quite easily - an ending where all problems just melt away</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bend It Like Beckham is a British movie released in 2002, directed by Gurinder Chada. It tells of a young British Indian Sikh, Jesminder Bhamra, who struggles against her families' tradition to full fill her dream of playing professional football. Unlike a conventional Indian girl, who learns to cook the traditional Indian dishes and get married to a nice young Indian man like Jess' sister Pinky, Jess aspires to achieve the success of her idol, football star David Beckham. When she meets Jules, who lives in a European family and also shares a passion for football, she grabs the chance to join the Hounslow Harriers, the local woman's team. When they both fall in love with their coach Joe, their friendship is tested. Jess has to keep this entire secret from her family, which proves to be really hard?.The movie describes the everyday life of an Indian family and what problems there can be in a modern society for an Indian girl who wants to go her own way.The movie suffers a bit from a sitcom mentality, as when, for instance, Jules' parents labour under the illusion that their daughter and Jess are actually lesbian lovers. The football isn't really real - the footy scenes are so incredibly fake and incorrect; and that last free kick is pathetic. The plotting, in addition is being predictable at times, for example, I wasn't moved by any sweetness, because anyone could guess that it was coming. Furthermore the love story is never really finished - Jules just accepts everything? The same goes for the story of Tony, a good friend of Jess...how does that play it out?When you are looking for some very dramatic scenes or a very deep story, than this isn't the movie you should go for. But when you want to have some lighter, but nevertheless very decent entertainment, than this is perhaps a movie that you should give a try. In closing, you won't be bored, but you won't be thrilled either.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bend It Like Beckham (2002)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie "Bend it like Beckham" by Gurinda Chadha made in 2002 deals with the conflict between cultures and conflicts between generations, but it's also a comedy and romance.The main character Jesminder "Jess" Bhamra (Parminder K. Nagra) loves soccer and David Beckham. When she gets the chance to play in a real soccer team for girls, of course she uses it, but then the problems begin. Her parents don't allow her to play soccer. They would like to see her cooking and married. So Jess must play secretly. In a good movie should not be missing a love story, so there is the young handsome Joe (Jonathan Rhys-Meyers), the soccer coach of Jess. of course Joe and Jess fall in love with each other and everything could be good if not Jess's best friend Jules Paxton (Keira Knightley), who had invite Jess to play in the soccer team, fall in love with Joe, too. It's obvious that Jules and Jess have a big argument. Into the bargain Jess is not allowed to have a boyfriend and hey sister Pinkie's wedding will be on the same day as her final soccer game.But at the end everything comes like it must: Jules and Jess become friends again. Jess's father allows her play at the game so that she gets a scholarship and can study together with Jules in America. Also Jess is allowed to have a relationship with Joe. And not to forget they all see David and Victoria Beckham at the airport. A perfect Happy End. Everything is good and everybody is happy.I think the movie has a convincing plot and is a little bit boring, but it has a wonderful message. We all should fight against discrimination and live our dreams. It's interesting to watch the movie, but one time is enough.</fullReview>

I saw this DVD at my library and decided to check it out.I'm so glad I did,because I LOVED this movie.It is very interesting,fun,and I got totally involved. I loved the characters,especially the two main girls.I also found Jess' poster of David Beckham "DREAMY",LOL! It was awesome watching Jess and her friend play soccer, and I found myself craving more and more shots of their moves. No wonder so many other countries love this sport.It is so much more rigorous,and requires so much more skill than American football. I have much more respect for a sport that a more "natural"(not full of steroids,and weight-lifted to bizarre proportions) human body is engaged in. These players are true athletes. This movie was a blast to watch and I could watch it over and over again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Light-Hearted Sporting Romantic Comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In case any American viewers were baffled by the title of this film, I should point out that David Beckham is not merely the husband of one of the Spice Girls but is also Britain's best-known soccer player.There are a few other things about it that might also cause bafflement across the Atlantic, as (unusually for a British film these days) it was very much made for the home market with few concessions to American tastes. There is no big-name Hollywood star (Keira Knightley did not count as such in 2002). The plot centres around one sport, soccer, which is a minority interest in the States, and the script makes frequent reference to another, cricket, which is virtually unknown. There is no attempt to cash in on American enthusiasm for Britain's historic heritage; the film is set neither in a stately home nor in a picturesque village but rather in Hounslow, a rather dull West London suburb full of pebbledashed semis. (Malvina Reynolds's song about "little boxes made of ticky-tacky" was doubtless inspired by equally characterless American developments, but to me it always conjures up a vision of somewhere like Hounslow). The characters all have either West London or Indian accents, and much use is made of British slang. Finally, the film touches on a subject, inter-racial romance, that most Hollywood producers would not touch with a ten-foot bargepole. (The film-makers did in fact make one concession as the original script dealt with an even more controversial topic- inter-racial lesbian romance- which would really have had the moral majority foaming at the mouth).In form, the film is a traditional romantic comedy. The main character is Jesminder Bhamra, a pretty teenage Asian girl who discovers a talent for football and becomes a member of a women's team, where she falls for Joe, the handsome coach. As is normal in rom-coms of this nature there are a couple of obstacles to the love of the young couple; Jesminder has a rival for Joe's affections in the shape of her friend and team-mate Juliette, and her traditionalist Sikh family do not approve of her playing what they see as an "unladylike" sport or of her romance with a white boy.Writer/director Gurinder Chadha is able to use this classical romantic comedy formula as a means of commenting on a number of issues relevant to modern Britain. The relationship between the more westernised Jesminder (who, significantly, anglicises her name to Jess) and her more conservative parents is of great importance, as important to the film as her romance with Joe. The idea of a generation gap between traditionalist immigrant parents and more modern-minded youngsters has become something of a cliché, but here Chadha tackles the theme without resorting to the usual stereotypes. (The film does not touch on the reverse phenomenon which sometimes occurs among ethnic minorities in Britain, with third-generation children returning to their roots and becoming more culturally conservative than their assimilated second-generation parents). Jesminder's parents are not presented as the villains of the piece, but rather as anxious to try and resolve, if at all possible, the contradiction between their respect for Sikh traditions on the one hand and their love for their daughter on the other. Her father (very well played by Anupam Kher) is particularly sympathetic to her, remembering that he himself was, in his young days, frozen out of a cricket team by racial prejudice. There is a similar divide in Juliette's family, where her sport-loving father Alan encourages her ambitions, whereas her neurotic mother Paula (another good performance from Juliet Stevenson) becomes convinced- quite wrongly- that her daughter is having a lesbian relationship with Jesminder.The film touches on some serious issues about the relationships between the races, the sexes, and the generations, but it does so in a fairly light-hearted way; this is, after all a comedy, not a serious sociological tract about cultural identity. The ending has a rather sentimental feelgood tone, and the football scenes seem to rely on every cliché of sporting fiction, such as the heroine coming on as a late substitute and scoring the winning goal with the last kick of the game. Overall, however, this is a highly enjoyable film with two likable and vivacious heroines in Parminder Nagra and Keira Knightley. Although soccer is the world's most popular spectator sport, it has never inspired any great films, and not many good ones. "Bend It Like Beckham", however, is one of the better ones. 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well, let's face it...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>...good reviews of this film are as common as sheep in New Zealand, and I'm not one to disagree.I once bought a magazine that came with a disc of trailers free. Bend it Like Beckham was one of these trailers, and I have to say, it didn't entice me to see it, but my darling sister decided that she wanted to, so off to the video store we went. The plot is this - Jess, a girl who is very good with a football, is discovered by Jules, a tomboy who cares only for her football and nothing else, except maybe Joe, the coach of the team that she plays on, and wants Jess to join. It's the opportunity of a lifetime for Jess but she has two small problems - ONE: Her sister is getting married soon, and her family and her need to pay attention to the wedding etc. etc, and TWO: said family is a strict Indian family. Jules also has the problem that her mother wants her to be the demure girl who cares about nothing but how they look or who their latest snog was.The fact that I was fairly apathetic about it just added to the delight I felt when I was watching it.It's a great movie, one of those that you walk away from feeling light and refreshed, like "Amelie" or "Playing By Heart".It's got its own quirky humour, that mainly shows itself through Jess's family dealing with her unorthodox hobby, but the highlight of the movie is Jules' mother, expertly played by Juliet Stevenson who also made me laugh as Mrs. Elton in "Emma".If you haven't seen it, no matter what you feel about football (or soccer, whatever term you prefer) see this movie sometime soon. If you have, get it again, it has definitely got rewatchable value going for it.In summary - good family movie, see A.S.A.P. 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Plenty have said a lot about this film, covering most of the themes. However something that doesn't get mentioned is the racism.Sure Jess's dad, Mr Bhamra, was the victim of white cricket players when he first arrived in the UK, to the extent that his talent was wasted. But look a little deepr &amp; you'll see a whole new, unmentioned, level of racism revealed.Mrs Bharma makes comments about Muslims that would be unaceptable if a white person made them. It's not as if it's a "foreign" muslim, i.e., non Asian, even Indian muslims are considered base &amp; beyond the pale. Also spot the reference to white people as "Ghuras". This reminds me of a Chinese person who once, in a drunken state, told me that they refered to white people as "boiled chicken". Now then, how much trouble would I get in to if I called a black person a "Spade" or "Darky"? There is a perception amongst everyone that racism has a white face, a racist slur to begin with &amp; simply not true. Whether the film makers intnetionally showed this matter up is still a question however.Beyond that the story is a little soppy, but not too over the top. Let's be honest, this is about girls so it's already straying in to areas of emotional minefields. Note how Jess gets in to trouble with her friend over the coach. First of all Jules told Jess she regarded Joe (the coach) as a brother &amp; Jess never kissed Joe. Yet Jules blasts Jess regardless of what actually happened. For once I'm glad to see a female character suffering the same trouble when dealing with female "logic" that men have to deal with all the time!The footage on the field is, of course, massaged to make them look good, although Jess &amp; Jules can obviously play. Is this a fair criticism when Arnold Schartzneger has the same techniques applied to his films? (note the Terminator 2 scene where Arnie pulls a gun from a bartender. The speed of movement was due to editors pulling every 3rd frame out of the film strip, NOT his fast reflexes!) The film's visuals do lack a decent polish, but since it was filmed on a tight budget this can easily be forgiven.It's a fairy tale after all, perhaps with all the films that portray what's right as the bad guy getting poetic justice at the end of some tired buddy movie, we forget that some times a little magic &amp; good news can be on show too.As an attempt to describe the unravelling of steroetypes &amp; attitudes within modern UK society it serves it's purpose well. It's fun to watch, without being gripping. The characters are a little cliched, especially Joe, but it shines a light into Sikh society as the next generation pulls away from their parents &amp; picks &amp; chooses the elements of Sikh &amp; UK culture that they feel comfortable with.There are some true comic moments, the cell phone ringing at the wedding for one &amp; the things Mrs Bharma sees as she wanders around trying to find her daughter for anotehr. So much for upright morals!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The theme of the conflict between the Asian immigrants in the UK with their home culture and traditions with the British culture was well rendered in several good films during the last decade. Time has come for the commercial feel-good movies to take over the theme, and 'Bend it...' is a good achievement on this respect. It approaches the many complex and serious issues like racism, homo-phobia, man dominated professions on the easy side, and the plot is melodramatic and twisted towards a happy-end in a predictable manner. It is however well acted, it deals with sympathy with all its characters, and it never is dis-respectful for any of the multiple cultures it deals with. Sometimes exporting Hollywood clichees to European cinema works, and this is one of the cases. 8/10 on my personal scale.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I walked into the movie, knowing full well of the international acclaim this movie has received. And had no doubts I would enjoy it. Enjoy it, I did. The film is about an Indian girl named 'Jess' played by Parminder K. Nagra, who is very partial to Soccer and plays it very well. She also idolizes the Soccer (football in the movie) star David Beckham. She meets a beautiful tom-boy beanpole named 'Jules' played by the lovely Keira Knightly. She gets her to join the Football team and falls for the coach (played by Jonathan Rhys-Meyers). But her parents frown upon her football playing, and think it is silly. So she spends the rest of the film breaking away from her parents and reaching her full potential as a football star. This film is the definition of 'feel good movie of the year'. And uses a plot unlike anything we have seen before. You end up rooting for Jess, and end up laughing at her family, to whom which were very comical. I recommend this movie very highly. Especially as a date movie. I can't wait to see the stars of this movie in other movies. I liked them all very much. Although, after all was said and done, I still don't know what 'Bend it' means.RATING:**** out of ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A funny family picture - this movie made my day</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'd been reading good things about "Bend it" long before it came here. So as soon as it arrived, I made plans to take my niece. I probably enjoyed it more than she did. I found it touching, genuine and funny, like "My Big Fat Greek Wedding" only funnier. I loved the lead actress, Parminder Nagra; I forgot all about the camera watching her. I loved the dads and the moms. I loved the closing credits of the cast and crew; they're hot hot hot! Okay, for a sports film, it could have used a bit more soccer action. And aside from two main characters, the rest of the team is a nameless blur. But still, if it comes out in VHS, I'm buying it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>10/10 Best feel good movie for years</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A fresh breath of air combining all the ups and downs of trying to make it. Real life family and role model life with none of the soaps crap. The movie just keeps going and going and it's one that you just can't leave. The ups and downs the "oh no" real life situations, who hasn't been there!? A great mix of music and songs keeps the waves going. I hope readers will see it before it becomes a great classic on re-runs (movies) on TV in a few years. If any of the following apply I suggest you take the time to go see it. You like soccer, fed up of soaps, enjoy a fun movie, ever been a coach (any sport), enjoy good music, have kids, remember the days before you "grew up"....... I can keep on but I really do recommend it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Follow your dreams and live your own life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The song "Move on up" by Curtis Mayfield works perfectly during a soccer practice montage and the lyrics go perfectly with the plot. "Hush now child and don't you cry. Your folks might understand you by and by. Just move on up! Towards your destination. Though you may find from time to time, Complication".What does the title "Bend it like Beckham" mean? Beckham is a soccer star that Jessie worships. Beckham has the ability to curve (bend) the ball around blockers and goalies.Jessie's parents don't get her, especially her mom, who wants her to marry a nice Indian boy and go to college. But Jessie has other plans to become a professional soccer player and perhaps date her Irish soccer coach. Do we lead the life our parents want us to lead or break away and follow our own dreams? Jessie is torn between tradition and her dreams.In a world that is quickly changing, it can be tough for a teenager whose parents want them to remain traditional in a culture that is breaking with tradition.I was very inspired by this movie. It also caused me to shed quite a few tears. Excellent acting, cinematography and music all combine to make this a very positive movie-going experience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I came away with a much better understanding of the Indian/Brit culture clash and the place or not of women in that struggle.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When 'Bend It Like Beckham's' heroine, Jess (Parminder K. Nagra), exclaims, "Anyone can do aloo gobi, but who can bend a ball like Beckham?" I figured I might be in for an interesting evening, given how little I know about Indian cuisine and how much less about British soccer (football). I didn't learn about either from this fuzzily friendly film, but I came away with a much better understanding of the Indian/Brit culture clash and the place or not of women in that struggle.Simply put, Jess's traditional Sikh parents now living in London want her to forget football and eventually get married to a nice Indian boy. Jess has other ideas, namely bending gender and culture to the will of her exuberant teen self, who idolizes the real ball bender, star footballer David Beckham. Yes, although `Monsoon Wedding' and `My Big Fat Greek Wedding' come immediately to mind, this film goes headlong into the culture clash with gusto because wedding is far from Jess's mind. In a sense, `Bend It' is the prequel to the other 2 films as it chronicles the strong Indian hold on a young girl and the skepticism of any culture about a girl becoming a prominent athlete. You could write the plot-it's as cliched as any other teen/culture film. Yet its sweet struggle of growing up is inherent in the film's tone and tempo. When mom accuses the female footballers of `displaying [their] bare legs to complete strangers,' you know the struggle is with old-fashioned Indian values confronting modern feminism and spiced with the timeless allure of athletic young women taking it off for the old glory of competition, not middle-aged men. When Jess refuses to romance her coach and be disloyal to her best friend at the same time, there is a goodness separating this comedy from all the others. Feel good you will; think about adults versus teens, tradition versus modernism you must. It's all so corny, so true, and so beautiful at the same time. I think it's called `life.'</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Life in Hounslow *can* be fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gurinder Chadha seems to go from strength to strength with every movie she directs."I'm British But... succinctly portrayed Asian life in contemporary Britain, while Bhaji On The Beach took the subject into the feature film; With Bend It Like Beckham she goes one step further, effectively mixing social realism with comedy and romance to equate an entertaining feature with a sharp script and great acting (Rhys-Meyers and Parminder Nagra are surefire bets for future Hollywood stardom).One thing to commend "...Beckham" on is that, in spite of its generic constraints (typical love story, narrative of underdog comes good against the odds, etc), it is as accurate a portrayal of modern Britain, or at least London, as mainstream cinema is ever likely to give us. The soulless terraced houses of Hounslow (ever a familiar sight to this Brunel alumni) or the acknowledgment that (shock, horror) ethnic minorities live in Britain are a stark but welcome contrast to white-washed bogus like Notting Hill or Bridget Jones's Diary.It would be interesting to see what Chadha will do with a more adventurous genre, because stylistically she's certainly more Lucas than Loach (and that's a compliment).</fullReview>

It has pretty convincing footballing from the principal girls, Parminder Nagra and Keira Knightley... and being a romantic comedy as much as anything else, it does help that they're easy on the eye as well. There's a solid support cast too with Anupam Kher (as Nagra's father) particularly on the money.It's full of the most obvious cliché's and a telegraphed narrative. But, as in the best Britflicks, this is not only dispatched competently but with wit, sensitivity and surfing its manifold irony. So, surfing the backwash of Britpop then. 5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You've Seen This Before, But So What?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We've seen this movie at least a dozen times, with just a few character name changes. From 'Dirty Dancing' to 'The Mighty Ducks' to 'Better Off Dead'.However, that doesn't mean you won't enjoy this telling of the formula. Sure, it's a pretty standard version of "talented kid defying parents' expectations to follow her dream", but nonetheless it's a very charming and enjoyable movie. It's definitely a 'feel-good' movie and you're pretty sure after the opening scene exactly how things are going to turn out, but the journey to the foreseen conclusion is pretty fun.A lot has been made of the Sikh angle, but I think a lot of people miss the sly parallel woven throughout the story.The movie focuses on Jes, a talented soccer player, younger daughter of a mostly traditional Sikh family living in England. Throughout the movie, she wrestles with her respect for her culture that opposes her hunger for soccer. Her parents don't think it proper for her to devote energy to a game when she should be focused on education, a proper relationship, eventual marriage and motherhood. Of course, many Western viewers will think, "Hey, that's stupid, she's almost an adult, she can do what she wants, the parents are living in the past!"Which is why those viewers miss the parallel in her Anglo friend Jules' story. She, too, has a talent for soccer...and is defying her mother's expectations and notions of 'proper' behavior and goals for a young Anglo girl.That parallel is what elevates "Bend It Like Beckham" from hundreds of other movies of the same formula. It's not an 'English' movie or a 'Sikh' movie or an 'Indian' movie...it's a movie about growing up and finding your own identity. A coming of age film, if you will. With a little thought and reflection, you realize this movie does more to destroy stereotypes and thumb a nose at racism than other, more 'serious' movies.Cultures and ethnicity may change, but growing up remains the same. And if you can bend it like Beckham, you've got a nice solid foundation to do the growing on.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Contrived script ruins film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are some things that I genuinely liked about this film but for every one item I liked I can think of three that I didn't. Story is set in London and an 18 year old girl who is a Sikh is very good at soccer but her parents are old fashioned and don't think their daughter should waste her time with such nonsense and instead concentrate on her sisters upcoming marriage and her own future as well. Parminder K. Nagra plays Jess and while playing soccer in the park with some boys a girl named Juliet (Keira Knightley) notices her and convinces her to join the girls soccer team. She meets her coach Joe (Jonathan Rhys-Meyers) and makes a good impression so now she is on the team. Her parents (Anupam Kher and Shaheen Khan) find out and forbid her from playing. She decides to lie and tells them that she has a job and this goes on for a while until her team travels to Germany to play their team. While in a German night club things get a little romantic between Jess and Joe and Juliet spots them and gets jealous. Jess's parents find out about Germany and get very upset. Meanwhile, Juliets parents (Juliet Stevenson and Frank Harper) think their daughter is a lesbian and is having an affair with Jess. One thing that I did enjoy was the lead performance by Nagra. She shows a real screen presence and maturity and displays a nice freshness to her role. She's a newcomer that everyone should keep their eye on. The scar on her leg is real and was written into the film. Also, the film does a good job of showing how diversified London is culturally and shows how large the Middle Eastern community is in that part of the world. But this script was just so familiar and to many of the characters are portrayed as old fashioned idiots. Its very difficult for me to believe that a Sikh family in this day and age would have such a reaction to soccer. And of course Joe is portrayed as a young and very good looking guy. Aren't all coaches? And the romance between Joe and Jess just does not come off as believable. Besides soccer, what do they have in common? The romance just seems so forced. And poor Juliet Stevenson! She's a terrific actress but she's forced to spew out ridiculous lines like "Take your lesbian feet out of my shoes"! The film goes on way too long and I kept waiting for it to end. The last scene in the airport seems to go on forever. This is a film that didn't want to end. Say goodbye already! This film does have an undeniable charm about it and its because of the performances by Nagra and Knightley but the story is woefully familiar and contrived. There was not one moment or scene that surprised me for even one second. We've definitely seen this film before!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Predictable but charming film, well written, well acted, beautifully directed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A while back when this film first began it's run at the cinemas, it seemed I was bombarded with ads for it on the internet whereever I went. I found it quite irritating after a while. Fortunately, being the fair minded individual that I am, I didn't let the ads deter me from viewing what turned out to be a pleasant little film. Not perfect, mind you, but enjoyable on many levels.This is a film about a beautiful young girl, Jesminder (Parminder K. Nagra) raised in a strict Sikh culture, who loves and honors her parents, but yet desires nothing more than to utilize her talents playing soccer. When Juliette (Keira Knightly) sees her playing soccer with the guys in the park one afternoon, she invites Jess to try out for the team coached by Joe (Jonathan Rhys-Meyers). Having considerable talent on the field, Jess makes the team, and quickly becomes best friends with Juliette. The problems arise because Jess's parents (Anupam Kher &amp; Shaheen Khan)want only for their daughter to learn how to cook and marry a Sikh, preferably someone of their choosing. So, in order to continue playing soccer, Jess must continually lie to her parents and sneak out to the soccer field though she isn't happy about having to be deceitful. To make matters worse, Jess begins to develop a crush on Joe, whom is also loved by Juliette. Add to this a sub plot about Jess's sister (Archie Panjabi) becoming engaged, unengaged, then engaged again, and the plot is teeming with complications.The film is somewhat predictable, reminding you at times of films like My Big Fat Greek Wedding, but everyone in it is engaging and believable. Directed and partially written by Gurinder Chadha, her characters are funny, sweet, and entertaining, without being overly broad or played too much for laughs. I do believe she could have edited the film by about ten minutes, as there are too many scenes of how Jess sneaks out to play soccer that become repetitious but that's nitpicking more than anything.Parminder K. Nagra is beautiful and endearing in her role as Jess. We see the love she has for her parents, but also her love for the game of soccer. She is torn between honoring her parents and disobeying them to fulfill her desire to play. When Jess's love for Joe begins to appear, it is easily one of the most sincerest sweet romances I've seen written in a while, and Nagra plays it to perfection. Kher and Khan do so well playing the parents, that in a funny sort of way, though we may disagree with their strictness, we wish for Jess to be able to honor them also. In too many films of this type, the parents can become more caricature than characters, so a big applause goes to the actors and Chadha for keeping things on track. Keira Knightly is equally as good as Jess's friend and her love for the game also causes a clash with her Mother, Paula (Juliet Stevenson), who believes her daughter should be out finding a man instead of wasting her female assets on the soccer field. Some of the funniest scenes in this film are between Knightly and Stevenson and are guaranteed to give you a few chuckles.I really enjoyed watching this film. Sure a lot of it is predictable, but when a director and her cast are as good as this, how can you go wrong? If you can spare roughly 105 minutes out of your day, take the time to watch this endearing charmer. You'll be glad you did.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm glad when a movie like this finds an audience. First of all, its not typical Hollywood product, which is a magnificent beginning, and you know that the director/screenwriter just had a vision of what kind of movie that they could make and didn't get all caught up in all that LA garbage you hear about. They actually had a story to tell, had to sell it, and someone believed in the project. I found some of the romantic/dramatic subplots slightly juvenile, but I'm a 40-something guy so its kind of natural that kind of thing might annoy me at times.I'd only seen Rhys-Myers in "Velvet Goldmine", which I didn't enjoy, but here he's very good and has a lot qualities I like in an actor. His eyes are very expressive and the camera picks that up. You don't learn that, you just have it or you don't. I like him enough to risk seeing the project he's doing for Woody Allen. For all the sub-par movies Woody's made in the past ten years, I never once questioned his choice of actors, and I'm certainly not starting now. Have fun with the movie. It doesn't change the world and, thankfully, doesn't want to either. 7/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As an English father of a teenage football playing daughter, I really identified with this film. Jesminder could well have been my own daughter. It was all so real. The whole family watched it twice and were all smiling at the end, - accept my daughter who thought it was rubbish and walked out half way through. Maybe the scene of the two stars having a bust-up over their coach was just too near the truth. This film does more for British Race Relations than any Government legislation.I am still left with a puzzle though. Could Jesminder really play football ? Having occasionally coached a girl's team, I couldn't make out if she had a double for some of the takes or whether she did actually have some footballing talent.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"This film --- is about how we are alike."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a very likable film about two daughters of a traditional, Punjabi-Sikh family living in Hounslow, 10 miles WSW of London. Pinky (Archie Panjabi) works as a stewardess out of nearby Heathrow; but her day-to-day private life centers around family and family friends -- and, typical of many first generation immigrants, the immediate environment is like an appendage of the old country. Pinky's self worth is measured by only one goal; and it has been influenced culturally by her mother since infancy -- marry a good, upstanding Sikh and raise a family. Pinky's equally pretty, younger sister and our heroine, Jesminder "Jess" (Parminder Nagra), also lives in a world where nearly all human contact is Punjabi. Outside the house, in school or public places, she is a typical teenager -- except that she wants to be a professional football ("soccer") player(the film opens with Jess daydreaming that she takes a pass from Manchester United's soccer superstar, David "Bend It Like BECKHAM," and scores on a header.Jess is befriended by Juliette "Jules" Paxton (Keira Knightly), who invites her to join a local girls soccer team. Without fanfare, this is the film's key event that opens all doors and windows -- as Jules' family is drawn into the cultural mix -- wherein WE begin to understand the film's point of view.The relationship between Jess and Jules is not presented as an example of cultural differences, but more as teenagers of one mind -- the two are more like each other at this age, than they are like their respective parents -- they enjoy boys (both have crush on the coach), shopping, sports, rock music and whatever young girls do and talk about. And despite spats, they are mutually supportive -- and good friends.The girls' parents provide the film with definition and its better moments. Both fathers (Anupam Kher and Frank Harper) are supportive and permissive -- pushovers for their daughters -- whereas the mothers are pragmatic traditionalists, looking out for the best interests of their children. Mrs. Bhamra (Shahee Khan) is a mother hen often grousing the coop -- she wants both daughters married with respectable dowries (preferably matched high on the socio-economic ladder), and her grandchildren reared culturally as Sikhs, following the teachings of spiritual leader, Babaji. Mrs. Paxton (Juliette Stevenson) is no less involved in her daughter's future -- believing that women should be wives and keepers of the household. As mothers (my mother, yours, and all mothers), Mrs. Bhamra and Mrs. Paxton have more in common with each other, than they do with their respective, long standing, social-cultural groups. Ms. Stevenson has one of the film's better roles; and she executes it with humor and sensitivity.We are grateful to Ms. Gurinder Chadha for this colorful and wonderfully outrageous look at a Sik family undergoing the pangs of westernization. A more universal point of view on the parents might have been appreciated, with sharper character studies, and maybe a camera or editing less prone to a sound bite style -- thereby adding a few minutes of film length. But none of these comments indicate a lack of enjoyment and respect for Ms. Chadha's achievement. The film includes some sexual content, including discussions on homosexuality, and some objectionable language; but all is within character, contextual, and acceptable viewing by pre-teens with parents present. And, if you have difficulty understanding the foreign language spoken in the UK, click on the English subtitles of your DVD.We hardly notice the Sikh Temples rising in our communities, or Sikh students in Harvard Yard, or their parents' successes in business, including agriculture, medicine, and branches of engineering -- or Sikhs occupying seats of government in England. The transition and success of immigrant families is no longer unique -- and, it is better that it be commonplace and accepted as such. Although the fresh and exciting differences stirred into the melting pot are welcomed, we have learned that when parents and growing children are at issue -- we are one universal family. We watched the Bhamra children grow up as our neighbors; and we ate, drank, sang, and danced too much at Pinky's wedding. This film is not about how we are different -- it is about how we are alike. Mrs. Bhamra will have to occasionally forego her aloo gobi, chappatis, and dal, to join us -- her new friends -- at McDonalds to dine in style on a Big Mac, fries, and a coke.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In a fair world, this wouldn't have had to be an indie movie. When I think about indie movies that got popular, I think about films like Juno, quirky and unusual films that came out at just the right time to strike a deep, fundamental chord with a mainstream audience. This film is not like that. It's a simple, straightforward story of two girls who love to play soccer.Then again, it is fortunate that this is an indie movie. Mainstream execs would have ruined this film. They are good at one thing: selling films to as big an audience as possible. That is not a crime, and saying it is their job, I have a hard time condemning them for doing it. But mainstream appeal comes at a cost: the soul of the film. Now I'm not saying big blockbusters cannot have a soul, but trying to convert a smaller film into a big blockbuster can drain it of what made it special in the first place.This film certainly is special. It's not spectacular- this is no MMFR or Godfather or Princess Mononoke- but it lifts itself above and beyond its genre contemporaries. The craft is excellent, from the cinematography to the use of music, and the writing is surprisingly spot-on.It is also impressively earnest. Many films of this genre have that studio sheen and professional smugness to them, as if they know they are exploiting their viewers for profit's sake. The quality of the films suffers for it. Typically, the people who write and direct these films are a generation or two older than their characters. If they care enough to put some effort into the film, this is either undetectable or inoffensive, but if they do not, things can get ugly real fast.This would have posed even more of a problem in this film's case. One of its two main characters is Indian. Studio execs have enough trouble handling foreign cultures in dramatic contexts. In comedic contexts, they are completely lost. This, along with racism and slavish devotion to traditional ideas of money-making, is one of three ways why they stay away from these sorts of movies entirely, and while that is heartbreaking and I'd love to see it change, I can't say it's comforting to see a big studio movie bumbling its way through a culture it does not understand. The end product is usually either bland and boring or, worse, stupid and insensitive.Thankfully, studio execs were not involved, and the filmmakers, who understand exactly what they're doing, handle their topics deftly and smoothly. This is not an esoteric film. You don't need a deep understanding of India, Britain, or Sikhism to like or understand this movie. But the filmmakers' knowledge informs on it heavily. They don't have to reach or shoot blindly into the dark. They know their playbook, they know what they're dealing with.This film is their baby. They put an unusual amount of effort into it. While not every sequence works, there is an air of grandeur and passion to the all thing. This is not to be confused with an air of pretension: this very much is a romantic comedy through and through. The filmmakers simply care about fleshing out their story and characters, making the experience interesting and thoughtful instead of half-baked and slapped together.The relationship between the two girls is stellar. Friendships are not often done well in films, but the playful, affirming chemistry between them is just great. While it does fall into clichés and contrivances, including a limp love triangle, its energy and fluidity and strength more than makes up for that. The way most hacks write friendships, it's a wonder they had friends at all- maybe they didn't. This film gets its two main characters and the relationships between them.If there is a villain in this film, it is binding, restrictive beliefs. The cultures these beliefs erupt from are not bad, but the beliefs themselves are, particularly when they stand in the way of dreams and hopes. More than soccer, this is a film about culture and how it defines groups of people. Jess' sister wants to have a nice Indian wedding and start a family, and that's fine. Jess wants to go to America and play soccer, and that's also fine. In an era in which so many are scared of losing their culture, this film shows that cultures are at their strongest when they interact with other cultures, swapping ideas and thoughts, helping everyone get the lives they want and strive for.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Eighteen year old Jess dreams of playing football like her hero David Beckham even though her playing is limited to having a kick-around in the local park. Here she is spotted by Jules; who plays for the local women's team. Jules tells Jess that she should try out and she quickly impresses Joe, the coach. She is invited to join the team but there is a problem; her Sikh family expect her to go to university and marry a nice Indian boy not 'waste her life' playing football. She tells her parents that she is going out to a job but it isn't long before they learn the truth. She manages to continue to play and Joe thinks that both Jules and Jess have what it takes to go to the top in the women's game. As well as the drama about the football there is confusion when Jess's family fear she is seeing a white boy, Jules' mother thinks she is a lesbian, Jules and Jess fall out because the both like Joe and Jess's sister is getting married? inevitably the wedding clashes with the football final that is due to be watched by a talent scout from America.This film is a lot of fun even if the basic plot isn't the most original and most viewers won't be surprised at how the story works out. It does bring some interesting twists to the genre and the fact that Jess is a Sikh allows some stereotypes to be played with in a gentle rather than offensive way. There is more humour provided by Jules's mother as she is embarrassingly keen to show how open-minded and unprejudiced she is? right up until the thinks her daughter might be a lesbian! The cast does a solid job; Parminder Nagra is really good as Jess and Kiera Knightly is equally impressive as Jules. The rest of the cast is pretty good too. The football scenes are decent enough; I enjoyed the way the scenes from the final match were intercut with scenes from the lively wedding party. Overall I'd recommend this to anybody wanting a decent feel-good film with a solid enough story and plenty of laughs.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>David Beckham is a British soccer star and the husband of Victoria Beckham ("Posh Spice" of the Spice Girls). His trademark is a goal shot that curves across the pitch and into the net. The soccer equivalent of an unhittable curve ball in baseball. "Bend it like Beckham" means making that type of spectacular shot. Apart from that, and a little shrine to him in the main character's bedroom and a faux-cameo at the very end, the movie has nothing to do with him.The movie is full of little soccer in-jokes, such as the present that one of the characters' parents give her of a jersey with the number 9 on it (property of the great Mia Hamm, to those in the know), references to "Posh 'n' Becks," the video homage to the WUSA one of the characters plays for a disbelieving friend ("They *have* that??"), lesbian gags, sports-bra gags, and so on.The story is about a teenage girl in England who idolizes Beckham and wants to be a soccer star. She has a real gift, but the two seemingly insurmountable obstacles she must overcome are the absence of a professional women's league in the UK (hence their fascination with our WUSA), and her parents, who are set in very old-fashioned ways that do not allow daughters, among other things, to engage in contact sports. The girl's family are portrayed with great affection -- think My Big Fat Greek Wedding. The girl loves and respects them enough to go through sitcom hell to conceal her growing soccer stardom from them.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film is about girls playing football (soccer in America). Jess is a Britidh Sikh teenager living in the London suburbs with her engaged sister and parents. When Jules discovers Jess, she invites her to play for the Hounslow Harriers and she does until her sister's wedding interferes with a tournament. Jess and Jules couldn't be anymore different. Jules is a white Briton who has a concerned mother played by Juliet Stevenson CBE. The film is about friendship and sportsmanship and family. It is a great family film and entertaining overall. The director is a woman and inspired to make this film herself. The film showcases Keira Knightley's acting abilities too. Her costar Parminder (Jess) is Magnificent.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bend It Like Beckham (2002): Dir: Gurinder Chadha / Cast: Parminder K. Nagra, Keira Knightley, Jonathan Rhys-Meyers, Juliet Stevenson, Shaheen Khan: Refreshing foreign comedy about shaping character stranded between two factors. Parminder K. Nagra stars as a teenage Indian girl who has a talent for playing soccer. Her family is heavily into tradition expecting her to follow sister's path as she prepares for her wedding. She secretly plays soccer until she is found out and forced to make a choice. Effective setup addresses family issues but travels formula grounds. This has all been done before but with the location change it attempts to try something new. Stylish direction by Gurinder Chadha that is perhaps better than the film deserves. Nagra stands firm as the lead who shelters a secret life. How her situation turns out isn't that difficult to foresee. Keira Knightley is wonderful as Nagra's friend. Knightley's mother sees both girls hug and believes that they are lesbians. Jonathan Rhys-Meyers plays Nagra's coach who sees potential but the role is pretty much standard issue with these films, and here it isn't too far off familiarity. The parents all behave like idiots with their religious beliefs that they attempt to shove down their daughter's throat. Religious elements are silly but theme regard realizing potential and bending it in the right direction. Score: 6 / 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Winning Coming-Of-Age Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Formula can work in several ways, but two seem to be predominant in our sentimental cinema system. One formula, perhaps found in a manipulative Katherine Heigl vehicle, travels down a bumpy path until it crashes into a nearby ditch. The dialogue, never witty to begin with, is littered with the clichés of the past. The plot, robotic in its determination to take a detour into Tinsel Town, causes an eye-roll instead of a deservedly smitten sigh. But then, there's the formula found in a Gene Kelly musical. We quickly figure out how everything is going to end (he'll get the girl! Come out on top! Defeat the "villain"!), but its ability to exude agreeable comedy and make the most of its befitting stars turns predictability into an art form. We want him to get the girl, to come out on top, to defeat his nemesis. Formula can work wonders, as long as it's done right."Bend It Like Beckham" is a formulaic coming-of-age dramedy, but never did I feel manipulated to smile, to laugh, to do anything pertaining to unbridled amusement. Years down the road, I may not remember the inner workings of its plot; what I will remember, though, is how much elation I felt during its quick 112 minutes. So lucrative is its formula that I turned into one of those middle-aged monsters who finds themselves unembarrassed to talk to the screen, begging the characters to make the right decisions.A radiant Parminder Nagra portrays Jesminder Bhamra, a British teenager of Indian descent. Though her family resides in London, still strong is their attachment to their strict culture. A picture of their maker hangs above the fireplace, judging every move; the mother (Shaheen Khan), conservative and close-minded, doesn't much care about education, preferring that her daughters learn how to cook a proper Indian meal and feed it to their (future) nice, Indian husband. But Jess feels trapped. She's a high school senior, bright, and completely in love with -- GASP -- soccer. While the other teenage girls in her culture have accepted their upcoming marital dilemma, Jess wants something more. She wants to receive a good education, to become the female David Beckham. Fearing the wrath of her domineering parents, she attends soccer practice under the guise that she's headed to a demanding job. Jess becomes close to a fellow teammate, Juliette (Keira Knightley), and soon develops a crush on her young coach, Joe (Jonathan Rhys Meyers). Before, her biggest concern was to avoid getting caught by her parents. Now, she not only has to worry about punishment; she also has to deal with the fact that Juliette fancies Joe too.On paper, "Bend It Like Beckham" sounds, expectedly, like tepid formula. But with its irrepressibly wonderful cast and knack for natural comedy, it's a notable success that gives us an excuse to abandon our problems and find escape in someone else's. It's a warm film, perhaps doped up with copious amounts of anti-depressant medication.The best thing about "Bend It Like Beckham" is Nagra, an appealing actress that gives Jess an immediately charismatic air. So often are we told to like the teen at the center of a coming-of-age movie; unusually, Nagra makes it easy for us to root for Jess. Delightfully supporting her are a spry, witty Knightley, a hilariously shrill Shaheen Khan, and Juliet Stevenson, who portrays Juliette's mother with extroverted comedic skill.It's rare to laugh out loud during a film, and "Bend It Like Beckham" provides plenty of gut- busters. Not because of a well-timed punchline, not because of a physical comedy mess -- because human interaction is funny, because clashing cultures can be funny. "Bend It Like Beckham" is a winner.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is just cinema at its best because it offers all the best and unique pleasures of this art : a moving story, a wonderful cast, a good soundtrack and a ton of feeling during the movie and being much better after it! I wanted to watch it for years because its original poster talked to me : two girls laughing playing football was really something that we don't see often ! Then, this year, i discovered that Keira was a great actress in « imitation game » and when i picked this one in her filmography, i just knew the time was come to watch it.Right from the start, i had good vibes : england, soccer, suburbs, community, friendship, values, traditions. It's really amazing how much the movie says a lot of essential things for every one and stays always accurate : sure parents can be stern but at the end they want only our happiness. Friends are people we met who are truly supportive of us. Sports are essential for our fitness as well as for our mind. Sure traditions and intolerance exist but there are peaceful solutions when we open our heart. This Indian teen is incredible and acts much better than very famous names. Keira is good and it's hard to tell then she would build such a successful career. So it was great to thrill for those teens, i had fun, i cried and i wish that i could have lived this same fairy tale at this age...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bend it like Beckham review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bend it like Beckham was released 2002 and is a comedy, drama and romance movie about a teenage Indian girl rebelling against her parents. The movie was directed Gurinder Chadha ho I also known for 'Paris, je t'aime', 'Bride and Prejudice' and 'Angus, Thongs and Perfect Snogging'.Bend it like Beckham is about reaching your goals even if it means you need to bend the rules. The movie is based around Jesminder Bhamra for short she's called Jess. She's the daughter of a highly traditional family from India who do not understand her desire of playing football. For them learning to make food and getting a husband are more important then football. If the movie sounds cliché, it's probably because it is rather cliché. You could probably guess the ending of the movie accurate with what I've told you. The movie doesn't tell you much you did not know about Indian culture, and even worse it touches on homophobic attitude of religious cultures for 3 minutes and drops it for the rest of the movie. Why would you have a gay character if you were never going to anything with it? The movie also attempts to show racism but that's also barely touched on. The movie is obviously just a football movie with a lot of tacked on content to cover the lack of depth. Tacked on content isn't bad it's just when it's done half-way and about such important topics. The movies saving grace are the actors who do their best to give life to the two dimensional characters. It's rather hard to find one bad actor in the movie, but by no means is the writing their working with any good. The movie is overall predictable, cliché and a bundle of half-done side content. There is not real reason for anyone to watch the movie at all it adds nothing new ore fresh to the world. The movie feels from beginning to end like a shore and that's when a movie truly fails. Even children I can see getting bored by the movie, I can't recommend the movie to anyone at all open hearted. The movie over all gets three out of six. It's not bad it's just so cliché and so meaning less that there is no reason to kill time watching the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not quite the realization of the impression from the title</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The story premise is actually an old classic within the animation genre, one that's 'never let anyone stop your determination' kind of thing. It's developed quite well from the introduction of the character to the final conflict. All the other colors is just like what an Indian movie is expected to be, full of complementary characters, complications, and conflicts here and there. The depiction of cultural influence is very strong, just as in any other Indian based movies. Although one thing quite disappointed me. The title, and the first sequence suggest that there will be David Beckham in person not just after that short dreamy scene. I expected at least Jes can go to see Becks play on the pitch or the like. But the whole movie is just centered on Jes, with the least depiction of how Jes tries to have a decent bent shot. She just goes all the way like a striker goes, while Becks is really a right wing player. The action is just a typical, even with Kiera Nightly. Thus I think this is not that good of an entertainment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cute teenage angst story with cultural twist</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I finally watched this movie over the weekend and it was pretty much what I expected, hence my OK rating of 6/10. The film portrays Jess, a teenage Panjab Indian living in London, who has special skills playing soccer. However, her family wants her to go to school, get a husband, get a job, have kids, and be bored the rest of her life. Jess will have none of it. The story goes on a predictable trail where she is discovered, gets to play on a girl's team, wins her father's heart, wins the final game on a penalty kick, and goes off to America on a soccer scholarship. Very neat and clean movie, but not much substance.There were several problems with this film. It could have been a lot shorter. Most of the soccer scenes could really have been cut down. The dancing at the wedding could have really been cut. The silly, puzzling story line of potential lesbianism should have seen the editing floor up close and personal, right next to the stupid homosexual scene with her best friend. For these, I blame the director. He tried to add some substance to a movie that really barely could handle what it had.The one bright spot was the exceptional acting of Jess's father. He was rock solid, believable, as was the other girl's father. But the two mothers, especially the English one, Juliet Stevenson, was way over the top. Again - fault of the director. Lastly, the coach, Joe, was OK, but really, come on, you know you're not supposed to fraternize with your female team, and you break the rules big time. If I was his boss, I'd have fired his butt on the spot.So, ignore all that nonsense, plus the unnecessary story lines, and you have a nice little teenage angst story with the Indian cultural twist to add some spice. If the Director had settled for that, this movie would have been much better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think that this movie is very sweet!It shows how two different cultures can overcome their differences and be united. With this said, it is also a romantic movie, that shows how love can interfere with friendship, hobbies and you're family.This is a movie to see with friends or alone. But when you see it, do not judge it upon the quality of the movie, but on the story, and the connection between the great actors. A movie does not have to have a very big budget, and the very best actors to be good. (but in this case i think that the actors really is great!) I think that this is one of the best roles that Jonathan Rhys Meyers have played. Give yourself time to see this, if you like comedian romantic movies!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good movie to teach culture and values</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First, if someone asks for a movie to spend time with the family, friends, girlfriend, this means that the movie it is for everyone.Different themes are treated in the movie. for example, this cultural thing of customs and tradition that a family has, specially the ones which appear in the movie as we could see, dealing with Jess's family would be difficult for the kids that nowadays are.It is a good movie to teach teenagers about different cultures, values, problems that they may have (acceptation, curiosity, friendship, dreams, parent control, problems, etc) and also the movie reinforces how important is this magical tool that most of the time we keep in our pocket, and this is communication and trust. we can see this all over the movie in relation to Jess and her parents, the support that she wants but the support that she doesn't obtain because she cannot express what she really feels. Besides the traditional image of an Indian girl has to show, avoiding the critics against her family. And the only thing that she wants to do is play football, that was her dream, and the dreams can be true. I definitely recommend this movie, you don't even have to know or like football to enjoy it. It won't be a waste of time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining from Start to Finish</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My daughter made me watch Bend it Like Beckham with her several years ago, and I found it to be one I can re-watch. It contains very little of the teenage romance and clothing angst that often fills young adult movies. What it does have is a lot of humanity and heart. This movie is made up of a multitude of small moments of cultural misunderstanding: some cute, some mean, some funny, all of which need to be resolved by Jess and her parents. It does a wonderful job of showing us the contrast between English and Hindu (living in England) middle class home life. It is about following dreams and using talents, within the cultural clash and racial prejudice of middle class suburban London. Set in Houndslow (a suburb near Heathrow airport) Jesminder Bhamra (Parminder Nagra) is an eighteen-ish girl caught between living in British society and living in a household still grounded in Hindu culture. Father is an airline pilot for (apparently) an Indian airline (he wears a turban in uniform). Jess is an extremely talented footballer (soccer) always running circles around the boys in the pickup matches in the park. She knows her soccer days will soon end with an arranged marriage and her mother's life ahead of her. She is unaware of any alternative, nor of any possible future as a girl soccer player. Enter Jules (Keira Knightley) a star player in a girl's league. She sees Jess beating up on the boys in the park and stops to watch on successive days then approaches her to join their team. Jess is stunned to learn there is such a thing as a girl's league. Jules also tells her there are even girl's pro teams in America. Jess joins her team and through teamwork and selflessness they become a deadly duo in scoring and assisting.Of course, there are problems: Jess has to keep the girl's team a secret from her parents, her mother is constantly demanding of Jess's time to do traditional tasks, her relationship with a white girl is cause for much gossip and malicious rumor within the Hindu community, she must bare her legs in public by wearing shorts, and there is a hint of romance with the coach (Jonathan Rhys Meyers) that causes a rift between Jess and Jules, conflicts and trust issues with her sister, and Jules's mother begins to think the girls are lesbian. Once her parents learn that she is playing on a team, they stand united that football is at an end and she will get married or go to university and then get married. Jess continues to sneak off and play until the championship game conflicts with her sister's wedding. But with the help of her cousins and her father, she gets away from the reception and plays the second half, returning to the wedding celebration wearing a huge smile that is not lost on her father.Poor father (Anupam Kher). He's the lynch pin of the story. As a young Hindu man in England he had been shunned on the cricket fields and quit on his dream in disgust. Now, he's caught between his daughter's dreams, talent and joy as a footballer; his assumption is that she will face the same indignities he had. He watches part of a match where Jess is obviously fouled by a white girl, but when Jess reacts badly it is she that draws the red card; thus enforcing her father's conclusion. There is also his wife's insistence that Jessminder must pursue a traditional life in the role of a subservient Hindu wife and mother. After the championship game, when the family discovers that Jess scored the winning goal, and has won a scholarship to play soccer in America, Father succumbs and refuses to deprive his daughter of the happiness that he threw away. At the end, both Jules's and Jess's families are saying goodbye at the airport. Jess's passionate kisses with the coach seemed ignored by her mother. I find this a script flaw. A Hindu mother (and most other mothers) would've reacted and could've been a nice comical ending moment. There was some predictability to the story, and I felt the end was a bit rushed. But all-in-all I found it an enjoyable and memorable movie from start to finish.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie is about hopes &amp; dreams dribbling their way past disasters. The film is well balanced - there's comedy, drama, romance, football and yeah, Beckham!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Indian 'Kudi' Jasminder dreams of playing alongside David Beckham one day (he doesn't need an introduction, I guess). She constantly talks to his poster, stuck behind her bed on the wall, like he's her best buddy. She maybe the only straight girl who doesn't dream of getting into his pants? rather shorts, unlike those bimbos her sister Pinki hangs around with. She's pukka to her Indian roots in all ways, except her love for 'football-shootball'; that makes her mother Mrs. Bhamra go 'Hai Rabba!' (she turns like a typical Indian lady to the poster of Guru Nanak, the religious guru of Punjabi Sikhs, every time she hears 'Football'). Mrs. Bhamra wants Jasminder to get a husband? and learn some cooking ? who else shall cook roti-shoti for him but she, right? She has high hopes her younger daughter would marry Teetu, Jess's (Jasminder's nickname) friend since childhood. Of course, Teetu will never marry her ? he's gay, still closeted. Teetu and Jess play football with a bunch of their Hispanic, Indian and Afro-American soccer buddies at a local park. Juliette or "Jules", an English girl is impressed with Jess' moves; Jules plays for Hounslow Harriers, a local football team coached by Joe, who's also her crush. Jules brings Jess to Joe and soon Jess joins Joe's team (hey, this could be a decent tongue-twister!) without informing her parents. It's totally a success tale for Joe and his girls on field, but it's the off-field drama that brings 'Bad News' every time.Everyone's got problems of their own, so Bend it Like Beckham never 'All About Jess', though Jess' definitely in s##t the most (in her own words). She's got the stuffiest family you can imagine (they seem stuffy to whites at least. To Indians like me, it's like watching home!) ? a dad who can't forget his disaster past with goras (whites) and cares for Jess too much to see her facing a similar treatment, a mom whom we know of already but wait? my notes also say 'she'll drop dead if Jess is found with a white man'; Jess' sister Pinki is better that the parents at least but she's the girl Jess would hate to become ? the looks- obsessed bad girl who has no problems having sex in a car (Jess' shy to expose her bra even in a girl's locker room, but that also could be because her seamstress comments on one occasion that Jess' breasts look like mosquito bites!). Family's no-no to football ? check. Then comes Pinki's marriage, and Jess can't keep her secret from the family forever; she doesn't actually, as she's caught often, but Joe somehow convinces her to play on.Jess does play on, mainly because football's her passion but also because she likes the lean and handsome Joe (cue thunder effect for Mrs. Bhamra). That sours up her friendship with Jules, who sees them almost kiss outside a club.Poor Jules risks losing Joe to Jess and her mother Paula Paxton doesn't make it any easier for her ? she wrongly thinks Jules and Jess are in love! Paula does clarify that 'she has absolutely no problems with lesbians. She was cheering for Martina Navratilova herself', but that doesn't stop her from getting snooping around whenever Jess and Jules are together ? the perfect prototype of a hypocrite. Plus she's Mrs. Bhamra's English counterpart when it comes to discouraging her daughter from football. 'Bend it Like Beckham' is all about hopes and dreams dribbling their way past disasters. What's best about this film is that it doesn't favor only one culture and acts bigoted against others. This makes the movie not just for 'Indians only', but just about everybody.It's a very balanced film ? there's comedy in it, drama, romance, football and yeah, Beckham! The Indian humor has been tastefully sprinkled in to spice up taste-buds, the drama is appropriately light and breezy and the romance is sweet like juicy mangoes. Gurinder Chaddha, the film's director, scores a winning goal, and we're all here to cheer.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>BEND IT LIKE BECKHAMFirst of all I just have to say that I did not see this movie all the way through, so this review is only for what I saw.I did watch most of it? I missed the first 20 minutes of the film, but watched the rest.It was pants!I didn't like the look of it before and after watching most of it I can say that I was right with my original instinct.The movie is about an Indian girl who just loves football and wants to play the game professionally? but her parents are dead against it.So she decides to go behind their backs and plays anyway.The movie stars Keira Knightly, Parminder Nagra &amp; Jonathan Rhys Meyers.I was very disappointed with the acting in this movie. Keira was OK? but it was definitely not her best role. Thankfully she got better after this film.Jonathan Rhys Meyers was the worst actor in the whole movie? he really stank up the place. His performance just felt so un-natural. He looked like he was reading his lines off of a dummy card all the way though the movie.It is a shame really, because I loved From Paris With Love? he did a great job in that, so I know he can act.The definite high note about this film was Parminder Nagra? she was convincing in her role. She is a very good actress.I suppose another reason I didn't think this film was any good is because I am not a football fan. Don't misunderstand me? I never let the subject matter decide if I like a film or not. I don't like ballet, but think Black Swan is an amazing film.There were a couple of bits in this film that made me laugh though. It is a typical British film. And there were some very normal lines in the movie, but when they were said in the London accents made them funny.I liked that about the film.I remember when this film was originally released? it was very popular. I don't know why. Maybe it is because here in the UK, most of the population loves Football. But maybe I am wrong.My girlfriend really liked this film? she gave it 7/8 out of 10. I was shocked? but we sometimes do have different tastes in movies.I will give this film 4 out of 10.Not good? and I will not be going out of my way to watch the first 20 minutes.If you disagree or think it deserves better? feel free to message me and tell me your opinions. :)For more of my reviews please like my Facebook page:https://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204?ref=hl</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bend It Like Beckham is a comedy-drama film about an independent-minded young woman discovers the joys of football to the chagrin of her family. It stars Parminder Nagra, Keira Knightley, Jonathan Rhys-Meyers, Anupam Kher, Shaznay Lewis, and Archie Panjabi.It was directed by Gurinder Chadha. The title refers to the football player David Beckham and his skill at scoring from free kicks by bending the ball past a wall of defenders.Jess Bhamra is an 18-year-old growing up in West London, where her family has taken every effort to stay in touch with its Indian heritage. Jess' father and mother are after their daughter to go to law school, learn to cook a traditional Indian dinner, and settle down with a nice Indian boy,the latter of which is high on the agenda of her older sister Pinky, who is soon to wed her longtime beau Teetu. However, her family is unaware that Jess has a secret passion:football . While Jess' enthusiasm for football star David Beckham is obvious, given the fact his photos cover the walls of her room, her parents don't know that in her spare time she likes to play a friendly game in the park with some of the boys in the neighborhood. One day, while Jess and her pals kick the ball around, she meets Jules, who is quite impressed with Jess' skills. Jules plays with a local semi-pro women's football team, the Hounslow Harriers, and she thinks Jess has what it takes to make the team. Jess knows that her parents would never approve of their daughter playing football, so she doesn't tell them, and starts spinning an increasingly complex series of lies as she tries to keep up a double life as a student and a footballer. Inspiring, compassionate, and with a sly undercurrent of social commentary, the is a lively feel-good movie that genuinely charms.Nagra and Knightley have winning personalities, but credit should also go to writer/director Chadha for getting the balance right between humor and pathos, and sporting and romantic action.Also,it may be a formulaic and clichéd film but it does work and keeps the viewer entertained.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really like this movie, and the women are beautiful. There is a lot involved when it comes to "Bend It Like Beckham", but one of the key themes in this movie is about breaking through a glass ceiling, which in this case, is the British class system, where you were born in a certain class, and you remain there. When you first meet, Jess Bhamra (Parminder Nagra), you see her playing soccer in the park with the boys and being better then them. She is noticed by Jules Paxton (Keira Knightley), who says she should try out for the girls soccer team who was coached by Joe (Jonathan Rhys-Meyers) who Jules had a crush on, but became the love of Jess's life). Neither girl was particularly happy. Primarily because of their mother's. Jules had the worst one (Juliet Stevenson) who felt she was a lesbian (Incorrectly), but Jess's was no bargain either (She had daydreams of her ruining her playing soccer). The soccer team would be their chance to escape from their lives. Jules really hated her life and would do anything to escape it (Soccer was a means to the end (Which is getting away from her mother and moving far away)). Jess was different, she cannot be like her sister Pinky (Archie Panjabi) who will be satisfied with living a traditional East Indian wife life. Instead, she knows she has a gift for soccer that came from God, and, does not want to choose between her family and soccer, she wants both, and is tired of sneaking behind their backs to play. As she said: (Spoilers) " I'm not lying any more. I played in the final today, and we won? if I can't tell you what I want now, then I'll never be happy, whatever I do." Earlier, her father (Anupam Kher), let her leave her sister's wedding, to go play in the final (He saw how miserable she was). In the end, her father who is a traditional Sikh, very stern but loving, is the one who realizes he has to let her follow her dream, and go play soccer. Note: Because of their ability to play soccer, Jess and Jules are both offered the opportunity of a lifetime which is a chance to get an all expenses paid, College Scholarship at Santa Clara in the USA. He said: " I don't want Jessy to suffer, I don't want her to make the same mistakes that her father made, of accepting life, accepting situations, I've seen her play; she is brilliant. I don't think anybody has the right of stopping her, I want her to fight, and I want her to win." Note: He played Cricket when he first came to England and because of discrimination, he stopped playing, and as he pointed out "Who suffered? I did." The final scene of the movie (Without Jess) involving her father and Joe playing Cricket, strongly suggests that he has accepted the decisions that she has made (Including dating a non-Indian in Joe), and she will have broken through her glass ceiling, and got everything that she wants and deserves in life, and will be coming back home. Note: Jess even says to Joe at the airport: "I will be back at Christmas, and we can tell my parent's then (About us)." Jules also got what she wanted, and you hope she will find happiness in America. It is a great film. 10/10 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a soundtrack!!! R&amp;B, Reggae, Pop, Rock, a lot of Ballywood. This movie, actually a formula Romeo &amp; Juliet script, was made delicious by the soundtrack. To hear vintage Curtis Mayfield, "Move On Up" was a pleasant and exciting surprise! It was meant to lyrically describe the girls soccer football) team, it also showed how things had changed in England, with former colonists and the British. The movie was sweet and definitely a feel good, "chick flick", with some good soccer thrown in. At a time when a crazy, racist, Neo-Nazi felt the need to shoot up a Sikh temple, it was good to see people just being people with their prejudices, mostly based on ignorance of the "other". Of course by the end of the movie everyone is getting along. Wouldn't it be nice if the world could be that way? It's a fantasy of mine that people actually got to know each other there would be no war, no genocide, no hatred. This movie had something for everyone, one to which I would take my grandson. I loved the wedding and the dancing! I was watching it at home at 7 AM, and I got up to bust a move! It's highly recommended by me. See it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gurinder Chadda's Bend It Like Beckham is more about culture and stereotypes than anything else. It is surely not a film about Soccer or Sports. So don't expect a Remember The Titans or Coach Carter or Chak De India here. Having said that, I will add that it is still an entertaining, witty and brilliant piece of work. What looks like a sports film from the outside actually deals with many different South Asian stereotypes and Issues that NRI's deal with. Arranged marriage, homosexuality, racism are some to name a few.Jasminder Bhamra is a young, naive teen who loves nothing more than soccer (Football to most, sorry I'm American) She is a smart girl and great in school. Jas gets offered to play in the bigger leagues but there's one simple problem - She's Indian! By the end of the movie, there are moments you take home with you. Mostly hilarious moments and some serious ones. Jas' struggle initially to play is well executed. Not to forget the scene when Tittu's parents come to Jas' house to break Pinky's marriage. Of Course the wedding scenes are funny. I also loved the whole Punjabi flavor of the movie, but that may be because I'm Punjabi.Flaws? Of Course! The film does drag at times in the second half. Also, some of the whole soccer moments seem uninteresting. I also felt there was some minor lack of chemistry between Parminder Nagra and Johnathan Meyers.The writing for the most part is great. I loved the one-liners in the movie. The movie guy in the end telling the Indian bride to look sad. "Indian bride never smiles, you'll ruin the bloody video," And also the one liners by the ladies in the end when Jas is accused of being a lesbian. "Lesbian? Her birthday's in march, I thought she was a Pisces," and "Lebanese? No, she's Punjabi" I was laughing hard at some of those lines. Especially the one's delivered by Jas' mom.The music is awesome. Although the songs are not original, they are placed right and work well.Gurinder Chadda's direction is excellent. I do not find her a great director but I feel she really hit the bulls eye with this one. Unlike most of her other work.Every performance is noteworthy. Parminder Nagra suits the role to the T. She's just a fine talent in this one. Another actress that stands out is Shaheen Khan as the crazy Punjabi mother. She's just phenomenal. Kiara Knightly does well. Ditto for Johnathon Meyers. The supporting cast is good too.However, the person who stole the show for me is a great Indian actor named Anupam Kher. He's just outstanding as the caring, sweet and concerned father. One really feels for the man by the end. Anyone who knows Anupam's work will agree with me on how versatile this man truly is. A delight to watch! Overall, Bend It Like Beckham works big time but only if you know the stereotypes and lifestyles of South Asians abroad. An Entertainer all the way!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's in both the surface and what lurks deep beneath,</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film's genius is not in what's obvious to the Syd Field-doctored eye: character arcs, themes, construction. It's in both the surface and what lurks deep beneath, but not in those layers of artistic topsoil that reviewers seem most often to scratch at. Powerful, sometimes semi- clad female bodies not simply on display but kicking the crap out of a football do a better job of naturalizing female strength and agility than Lara Croft or Zhang Ziyi will ever do. These are real bodies (Keira Knightley's excepted) whose work is not to look great first and kick butt later. They are working bodies whose beauty is in their movement and self-determination. And, in my book, lead actress Parminder Nagra is one of the most gorgeous creatures ever captured on screen ? not only because she can lay claim to that hackneyed adjective, "luminous," but because her performance has an honesty and un-bookish intelligence that's utterly compelling.The result is a film women can enjoy without feeling like they're making a pact with the devil to do so. As in Chadha's "Bride and Prejudice," the relationships amongst women sizzle with a chemistry that can't be neatly slotted into the stodgy, Sweet Valley High categories of "best friends" or "sisters." Perhaps Chadha is even right in her commentary to disavow the film's flirtation with lesbianism. "Bend it Like Beckham" has an electricity that can't be reduced to the simple hetero/homosexual love triangle its conventionally structured script would suggest. The precise nature of its pleasure is, ultimately, a bit of a mystery ? and is all the more seductive for it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bend It Like Beckham is a fun movie about a British Indian girl named Jess (Parminder Nagra) who loves the game of soccer more than anything, but is encouraged by her traditional parents to abandon her passion and focus on other areas of her life, like finding a husband. She lies and defies them in order to keep playing, but her deceit causes friction at home, while a love triangle develops between Jess, her coach (Jonathan Rhys Meyers), and her best friend on the team (Keira Knightly).&nbsp;It may not be an original story, but it's a fun one that's frequently joyous to watch, and the focus on Indian culture made it seem fresh to me. The acting and soccer match scenes are equally well done, and the themes of culture clash and following one's dreams will be easy to sympathize with for most people.&nbsp;Bend It Like Beckham is just a good, solid, entertaining family flick to watch. The movie was clearly made with a respect for Punjabi culture and a genuine love for soccer.&nbsp;It's hard not to like; give it a try.&nbsp;</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Typical feel good movie, it is not a great work of cinematography but it is not meant to be. Goal of this film is to entertain and to make you feel good, and this is accomplished with no problem. The story is quite simple, about Indian girl struggling to play football against her parent wishes. The biggest assets of this film are the actors. Acting is overall good, especially two central girl characters. Nagra plays girl seven years younger than she should be beautiful, is very cute and you really feel for her when she is in despair. Knightley in her breakthrough role is shiny, girly and very sympathetic and plays her tomboy girl very good (she is also incredibly beautiful, no wonder she pull it through after this). Another notable actors is Stevenson in the role of Keiras mother, especially in the scenes where she find that her daughter is not a lesbian. You can really see her relief, great scene and great acting. Football scenes are quite unrealistic, but I will forgive this because this film is not really about football. This the film to watch when you do not feel good, because energy and shine of the film makes you better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Parminder Nagra wants to "Bend it Like Beckham" in this 2002 film also starring Keira Knightley and Jonathan Rhys-Meyers. Set it England, Nagra is Jesminder, nicknamed "Jess" who loves to play soccer and is recruited into a women's team by a fellow player Jules (Keira Knightley). There, she meets the team's coach, Joe (Rhys-Meyers) on whom Jules has a crush.But playing soccer is at odds with Jesminder's traditional Indian family, so she is constantly lying and sneaking out of the house. Joe encourages her to live her own dream, but it's hard for Jesminder to break away from what her family expects. And with her sister about to get married, she's expected to help out. When her sister's wedding falls on the day of their big tournament where a talent scout from America will be present, Jess is forced to make a decision.This is a really lovely film with many warm and funny moments and situations. The beautiful Nagra, who was so good on "ER" is sympathetic as Jess, with Keira Knightley a feisty Jules. At one point, Jules' mother believes that Jules and Jess are lovers. A very funny performance by Juliet Stevenson as Jules' mother."Bend it Like Beckham" covers a lot of ground - compromising your dreams, going after your dreams, prejudice, looking butch, and the perception of women in Indian vs. modern culture. In the end, it's really a story of finding out who you are and not being afraid to state it.This is a family film. Someone mentioned that it is bashed on this site. I really can't understand that. It doesn't pretend to be anything other than it is - ethnic tradition versus the modern world and a young girl caught in between. No special effects, no enormous names, just a nice story and script with good performances. Very enjoyable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another fantastic Indie from Fox Searchlight</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>God, how I love Indies. They're funny, unique, usually somewhat dramatic like a dramedy, and special in their own way. Which is why I simply love Fox Searchlight studios: they've created movies that drop from indie heaven, and they are a fine studio. Bend it Like Beckham is in no way any exception: it's funny, smart, dramatic, special, and gives you that feel-good feeling inside. Parminder Nagra, an actress I have never seen act anywhere else, plays the Indian teenager Jess living in England with a passion for football (for us Americans, soccer). Her parents say otherwise, though, and she ends up lying and cheating out of her culture just so she can follow her dreams of one day playing professional. Her idol in life is David Beckham, much to her parents disprove. Almost in every way this girl is a rebel, and that's partly why the movie is so great. She will stop at nothing to make sure her dream is realized. Now, why, you ask, is a movie about that so appealing? Well, that's a question you'll need to see it to properly understand the answer to. The movie delivers a powerful, almost controversial message: your dreams are the most important things in your life. Put nothing ahead of them, and follow them until they come true in every way you originally imagined them to. This is a good movie to watch along with the recent film "Little Miss Sunshine," as they both deliver the same message, and are both produced by Fox Searchlight, simply the BEST in indie film producing today. Rent "Beckham," don't miss out on the fun. :)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Bend it like Beckham" is an entertaining movie about the conflict between Indien traditions and the lifestyle of the youth in Britain , by Gurinda Chadha, who produced it 2002. Parminder Nagra plays Jasminda an Indien girl who has a great passion for football and David Beckham, lives in London with her family, which is very traditional. While playing in the park, Jules ( Keira Knightley ) sees her talent and invites her to come to her girls football team which is coached by Joe (Jonathan Rhys-Meyers ), they both fall in love with him, but he likes Jess more than Jules so the conflict programmed,But when Jess's family finds out that she is playing football in a team they forbid it. In the end her family accepts her passion and let her go to a college in America to play professionally . Girls playing football? Yes, they do. You don't need to be a football fan to see the movie, because it's more in the background, the main topic is how Jess gets more independent from her family. The actors are doing very well and you can identify easily with the characters which are well developed. The music is not really new but fits to the scenes and underlines the emotion of it. It has comedy and drama, love an humor, conflicts an success. The film is worth seeing it, because of the terrific actors and the nice story which is not too complicated and doesn't get boring, so it's something for the whole family. I liked it and I would see it more than once.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie " Bend it like Beckham " by Gurinder Chadha is a great comedy which deals with the conflict of a young girl living between two coltures . " Jess " ( Parminder K. Nagra ) is a young Indian girl who loves to play football but she only plays football in the park with her friends - until "Jules" ( Keira Knightley ) , who is already playing in a professional football team for girls , notices Jess great talent and takes Jess with her for one training - and so the chaos begins - Jess doesn't tell her parents about the team , because they are very traditional and religious people - even wearing football-shorts is scandalous in their point of view . And if that wouldn't be hard enough , Jess falls in love with her coach - the same boy Jules has fallen in love with ... Inevitable all these confusing circumstances are causing to trouble and Jess begins to realize that somehow she has to make a decision - her parents introductions of an fulfilled live or her dream of playing football as a professional ... Even if this is a typical Hollywood movie with a big happy-end and a predictable story it is a great film to watch ! The actors are very good and it has got a nice comedic action ! Although that film makes you laugh a lot , it also shows you some true problems in our society and this is why " Bend it like Beckham " is not only a movie like many others : Living between two cultures can be very hard - also Jess realizes , that it is impossible to link the traditional way of life with the modern way of London-living. These problems and these fascinating actors make it easy for the viewers to identify themselves with the intention of the movie and transferes the main aspects - understanding and respecting different culture - in a humorous way . So all in all - a great movie with a good intention - but what a pity that the story is so formulaic !</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hello @ all!!I really like the film "Bend it like Beckham". I think it's a really nice story with really convincing actors. I like the connection of two cultures, sports and a love story. The music is beautiful and fits to the context. In my opinion the whole film is really funny even if the actors don't make jokes but it's just the whole story that fascinates me really much because there is one chaotic thing followed by the next. I think the end of this film is a little bit unrealistic because the connection of our cultures and the agreement of the parents of for example Indian girls, to live like they want, will need much more time. In my opinion for example to play football - a sport which "just men" are doing - or to have a white boyfriend is almost unobtainable for the Indian girl in this film. But I love "Happy Ends" and so the film is really wonderful to watch for most people. It's a really nice kind of imagination how to connect cultures and their way of living and their religion. The film also shows that it's not always easy but that it's not impossible if everybody make a compromise with each other.All in all I recommend this film to everyone who likes love stories and Happy Ends! Have fun while watching it! :)Greetings, Isabelle</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gurinder Chadhas' "Bend it like Beckham" is an all in all entertainer that will find its way right into the hearts of all who watch it.Jesminder "Jess" Bhamra (Perminder N. Nagra) belongs to a traditional Sikh Family living in London. Her strict mother and father (Shaheen Khan and Anupam Kher) want Jess to wear nice clothes and learn to cook aloo gobi! But Jess on the other hand, rebels against her orthodox family and joins a local girls soccer team.Gradually Jesminder falls in love with her coach Joe (Johnathan Rhymus Meyers) and becomes best friends with Jules (Keira Knightly) who is also in love with soccer and Joe. Jules also has an overbearing mother (Juliet Stevenson) who is bent on making her daughter more lady-like. The rest of the movie is about how Jess convinces her family to allow her to play soccer and date a whit guy, and a solution for the love triangle.Chadhas' foundation of the film that of a rebellious child, is old, but her treatment makes the movie interesting. Not only Jess' screenplay, the development of her as a person, but also the changing values and culture of the teenagers are presented quite well: Jess is urging to break the social norm of the Indian traditions, her sisters' (Archie Puryabi) sexually-active relationship and the gay Indian, Tony (Ameet Chana).Another excellent aspect of "Bend it like Beckham", is how the Indian obsession with lady-like daughters is parallel to the British as well. The film shows the need for social and cultural reforms in both societies.The scenes with J. R. Meyers and Parminder Nagra deserve special mention, because the characters are from different cultures so that their love has to be hide and this is shown to the viewer in a convincing way.Techniqually, the film is all right and nothing spectacular.To sum up, I can only strongly recommend this film because the performance of the characters is really great and the movie is highly entertaining for all who like comedies linked to a little bit of love story,So it is a definite must see for you!</fullReview>

The football parts in the movie are just a package of low class football scenes that are compiled unkindly. The tension that should come up, when you see the film, suffers under the fact, that it is to predictable. The title and this Beckham cult is ways to overacted and doesn't really fit the film and is just to fancy football fans, who will be disappointed after watching the movie. The conflict between Indian and British and the story is interesting and well shown but its just not entertaining.Julian D.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Review of "Bend it like Beckham"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie "Bend it like Beckham" produced in 2002 by Gurinder Chadha, is a well-written, funny and heart warming film with a nice message about being true to your own dreams.I have watched this film for the first time in 2003 when I have met some friends for a movie night. Although I don't like football the film sounded interesting for me, especially of the subtitle "Who wants to cook Aloo Gobi, when you can bend a ball like Beckham?" It is a sports movie with the usual sports clichés, but it also includes a nice romantic comedy and a good drama about a young woman from an Indian/Sikh family living in England who wants to follow her dreams of football. Otherwise she learns that her wishes are in conflict with the desires of her parents and her cultural traditions. Moreover the film celebrates the exuberant lifestyle of the Indian people, who know how to party and so a big wedding is a key part of the film. The film's main character is the 18 ? year ? old Sikh girl Jesminder Bhamra (played by Parminder Nagra) who is a very talented football player and has a real chance to play professionally. In addition her big idol is David Beckham to whom poster she talks in a way how some people talk to God. However, her parents think that football is a waste of her time, because they want her more likely to study and become a solicitor. Beyond it, they want a marriage for her with a nice Indian boy from a good family and even to cook Aloo Gobi. Jesminder becomes also less support from her sister Pinky, because she has exclusive interests in fashion and her marriage which is approaching. Accidentally, her talent is noticed by the footplayer Juliette Paxton (played by Keira Knightley), when she was playing in a park with the local boys. She invites her to join a women's football team. She happily accepts to join the club, even though she knows her parents would disapprove. Jesminder becomes a key member of the side and Juliette's best friend with whom she shares her dreams and similar cares. But complications arise when she and Juliette are both attracted to the same man, the Irish coach of the team, Joe (Jonathan Rhys-Meyers). By the way Jesminder uses a series of lies and deceptions to get her way and her involvement in modern British society, which also gets her family into enough trouble with the Indian community. Although her father wants her to be happy, he also feels she won't be given a fair chance at a football career, because of racism. In addition her mother forces her daughter to be more traditional, like her sister, Pinky. The movie also shows that immigrant families are not unique in their adherence to tradition. Juliette's mother also doesn't hold much from the sport ambitions of her daughter. Hilariously, she fights with her 'shock', because she thinks that her daughter is in a lesbian relationship with Jesminder.As you see the resulting situation sets up a number of culture clashes between traditional values and a modern British society with a row of comical to serious moments, as Jesminder, her friends and family, try to negotiate their way between the expectations of this two cultures and their own dreams and desires. Although you can almost guess what is happening at next, there are some turning-points, which brings many questions up in your mind. Will Jesminder really live her dream? What happens to her romance with Joe? Will she get on well again with Juliette? What about her football career in future? You want to know it? Well, then watch the movie and find it out! All in all it is a well-directed movie with some really convincing effects, acting and Dialogues, which shows a typical problem of people living between two cultures with which you can identify with. In my opinion I would recommend this movie for all people, who experiences difficult times, because it is a really feel-good-movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Interesting plot-unrealistic ending. Gurinder Chadha's "Bend it like Beckham" deals with Jess (Parminder K. Nagra) a young Indian girl with only one passion -football. During the movie Jess meets Jules (Keira Knightly), a member of a real football team for girls, who takes her to one of their trainings. And now? Yes you're right! Jess plays so brilliant that she becomes one of the main players of the team.But stop...there is a problem. Jess's traditional Indian parents don't want that their daughter plays football. So she doesn't tell them and begin to live a double life. But what is a respectable teenager- movie without a love story? Surely we have love in here. Jess and Jules both fall in love with their handsome coach Joe (Jonathan Rhys- Meyers)what makes the situation much more complicate. In the end Jules and Jess are discovered by a famous football coach and start a career in America. That's real life isn't it?Although the ending is obvious from the beginning the movie shows us cultural differences mixed with sport and love in an interesting and sometimes really funny way. All in all "Bend it like Beckham" is a congenial and entertaining movie with and interesting plot but an unrealistic ending.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>BEND IT LIKE BECKHAM- a film review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Football only for men? Not in the film BEND IT LIKE BECKHAM by Gurinder Chadha! In this film women are portrayed as "football fanatics". Some women adore football players because of their good looks, but there are also girls like Jess. She is a British Asian and she is 18 years old. In her room she has a David Beckham "altar" but she admires him more for his playing ability than his appearance because she plays football, too. One day Jess' potential is spotted by another girl, Jules, who is a player of a girls soccer team. Her dream is to play professionally in the future. But very soon Jess shares this dream... However, not only football comes to the fore in BEND IT LIKE BECKHAM, but also the conflict between traditional Asian values and a more modern outlook. The film shows what a difficult balancing act it can be for a young British Asian between her traditional family roots on the one hand and modern life and her dream on the other hand. All in all BEND IT LIKE BECKHAM is a great film with fantastic actors, typical "English" humor, a happy ending and a serious message at the same time. So "Anyone can cook aloo gobi but who can bend a ball like Beckham"?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great movie with a thoughtful and well developed story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you wonder what the post-colonial experience in the British society and a first class culture clash, soccer being its center, look like, you definitely need to find out about the story Indian teenager Jess (Parminder Nagra) from Houslow, Greater London, has to tell us. Having been playing soccer in the park a lot and watching it on TV, Beckham being her idol, Jess has taken a stand, no matter if her conservative Indian parents accept it or not. Soccer is her life and Jess' dream is about playing it professionally one day "No more football!", Jess's mother, Mrs. Bhamra, demands, but Jessminder doesn't care. Playing on the Hunslow Harricrs' team she's found her way and is happy. It takes several conflicts with her family regarding the clash between traditional values and a modern British society, until Jess' father, Mr. Bhamra, realizes that "anybody has the right of stopping her" if soccer is Jess' life. Eventually, there's a Happy End to the movie, although the viewer might be surprised how quickly things can change in the Bhamra family considering the parents' original opinion on Jess playing soccer. In addition, Jess' crush for Joe, the coach, seems unimportant but not schmaltzy. However, it doesn't really contribute to the overall success of the movie. Gurinder Chadha does an awesome job, no doubt. You definitely need to watch the whole movie a couple of times to notice all the details and to fully realize the whole dimension of the conflict explained in that great movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>BEND IT LIKE BECKHAM, reviewThe movie Bend it like Beckham by Gunrinda Chadha handles about the dream of playing soccer from 2 young girls living in england. Further, it shows up the confrontation between two cultures in one place - London, england. Actually, you could say this movie includes a lot of different aspects: love, sports,ethnic conflicts and typical problems of the youth like relation to parents or friends etc. The storyline is mainly the way of Jesminder Bhamra becoming more and more professional in playing football, starts with kicking with the guys in the park. The other elements search their place in the strand. There is Jules, who gets Jess into a girls soccer team and becomes a good friend of her. Joe, her coach, also is important: both of them fall in love with him, and the rule in their team is not to date the coach. This brings in a conflict between the two friends. The other problem in Jessminda's way to grew up in soccer is that she has no parental permission to play football, which is mostly caused by her parents ethnic background.also she has no time to play soccer because her sisters will marry soon and so this is the main thing she has to worry about at the moment. Briefly, it's a conflict between to different world which clash against each other. When i first watched the movie, it was over 4 years ago in cinema and i was 14 years old. My intention to watch that movie was like "beckham-&gt;football-&gt;lovestory=interesting--&gt; watch this movie". So my impression of this movie was "just average". But when i was "forced" by my English course to watch this movie again, with another point of view, being older and able to realize the different layers integrated purposely, it was very interesting and exciting to watch this movie, even if the story and it's ending is very simple and obviously. Primarily, the movie should be watched by people like me, who lives a kind of life between two cultures, because it's pretty interesting to compare the situation of Jessminda with your own. Now, to criticize one thing: In my opinion, the title of the movie is picked awful, because it just do NOT represent any parts of the movie and David Beckham is just involved for the purpose to get more attention to this movie, and honestly - his function in this movie is nearly zero. It's completely unnecessary to mention him in the title, it even delivers a wrong imagination from the plot of the movie. Anyway, I just can repeat myself and in suggesting that everyone should watch this movie, whether interested in football or not. I can't promise that you will like it, but it's definitely worth to see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bend it like Beckham, a film review by Naheed AkhtarThe movie "Bend it like Beckham" directed by Gurinder Chadha, made in 2002, is a story about an Indian family living in Great Britain. Jesminder Bhamra (Parminder K. Nagra), the youngest daughter of the family, is really into soccer and David Beckham, who is her idol, of course. The movie deals with how Jess lives between her passion and the traditions of her family, which are contradictory. The director emphasized this by showing us the English lifestyle, while at the same time we listen to Indian music in the background. It's a typical problem described in this movie: young people living in two different cultures. Jess is practicing football just in her free time with some Indian boys from the neighborhood, when she has been invited by Jules Paxton (Keira Knightly) to play with her in a real soccer team. Nevertheless her parents do not allow her to do so, she plays it secretly. As you can imagine, she plays soccer very well and after a while there is no chance of hiding the story anymore. So Joe (Jonathan Rhys-Meyers), her coach, tries to convince her parents of her potential. But her parents are stuck on the idea that Jess has to study, and should learn how to cook, or even find a marriage-partner like her sister Pinky, who is on the verge of getting married. In addition Joe and Jess fall in love with in each other, and this is, of course, also not allowed. I don't think it's very unexpected that Jules also loves Joe. So guess what? Yes, a big argument between the best friends is just around the corner. "Bend it like Beckham" is a film in which a girl from traditional and conservative family backgrounds tries to fight for her independence. Also you can almost guess what is happening at the end, you ask yourself if she really will be allowed to live her dream, if she and Jules will get along again, if she and Joe will be allowed to start a relationship, and if she really has a chance in that football business. I think it's a convincing movie, because it shows a situation that every person living between two cultures can identify with. In addition it is a good mix with sports (I like the fact that there's not too much of it), entertaining comedy, romance, and parental expectations. To my mind the film has an effective message to all of us: to be true to yourself and your own dreams. The title is a metaphor meaning that you have to twist and turn and bend yourself, just like the ball in a match, to get to your goal. All in all an entertaining plot with a happy ending!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have seen ?Bend it like Beckham" and I think it's a good movie if you like romantic movies that always deal with the same topics. This film is about an Indian family who lives in England. The main part of the plot is about Jesminder Bhamra who played a lot of football in her free time in the park. Until she met Jules who plays in a professional girl team and offers her to take part in a workout. The problem is that her Indian family, especially her mother, has a problem with Jess' passion. They complain about Jess showing her bare legs in a typical masculine physical exercise. She pretends that she has a job so she can play football after school. Her coach, the good-looking Joe, supports her in every way. Of course Jess falls in love with him which also causes an argument with Jules. As a second story thread the movie deals with the wedding of Jess' sister Pinky who is going to marry on the same day that Jess has her final game. So she has to decide. To sum up, I can recommend this film only for people (better: girls) who are looking for a romantic movie they can watch without having big stuff to think about. But for them it's a really well made film with a nice plot.-Svenja-</fullReview>

		<fullReview>BEND IT LIKE BECKHAM, a film review by Jennifer MillsThe movie "bend it like Beckham" by Gurinder Chadha, is a movie about two together clashing cultures in Britain, in which the main character, Jesminder Bhamra, tries to fulfill her dream of being a professional football player. Including funny sequences, a love triangle, sports action and an Indian wedding, the movie fills every part of entertainment - it even throws up the conflict between sexuality in Indian and British culture. To strengthen the plot, Chadha uses very characteristic characters. One the one hand, there is Jess, who tries to fulfill her dream as a professional football player and still tries to satisfy her family in being a traditional Indian girl. Jules has similar problems - her mother does not like her way of clothing either, nor does she like her playing football. Jules mother is a very society orientated person, who misunderstands her daughter often, which leads to a sexual misunderstanding, in which she thinks, her daughter and Jess are lesbian, and goes beyond the scope on Pinkys, Jess' sister, wedding. Joe, the coach of the football team in which Jess and Jules play, is the trigger for a bad argument between Jess and Jules.As you see, there are a lot of things to discover in this movie. It definitely won't get boring - even if you watch it more often. And even if you don't like the plot (which is not very likely) I promise you will look at other cultures different after you watched the movie - maybe you will even find similarities between Jess' and your life. My suggestion to you is: watch the movie! You won't regret it - IF so, then you are not up to a different point of view. So are you ready?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>BEND IT LIKE BECKHAM by Gurinder Chadha is a comedy with an ethnic background, too. There is a typical British humour combined with serious cultural problems, but they are also presented in a funny way. The film is about a teenage girl whose Sikh family lives in the London area near Heathrow Airport. The protagonist is Jess or Jesminder Bhamra (Parminder K. Nagra), who loves playing soccer. Her inspiration is David Beckham and she has a large picture of him in her bedroom. But she is still a teenager, who lives with her conservative parents. She starts playing for a team of girls, but she has to do it without the knowledge of her parents, because they would not allow her. Jess's family is planning all for the wedding of her older sister, so first nobody notices Jess' problems. But everything comes to an highlight when Jess's big game and her sister's wedding are at the same day. At the soccer team Jess and an English girl named Jules Paxton (Keira Knightley) become friends. They play well together in the soccer team, but their problem is their handsome Irish coach Joe (Jonathan Rhys-Meyers), in whom they both fall in love. To give this all an amusing touch, Jules' parents furthermore think the girls have a lesbian relationship. These are the main problems and if you want to know, how these problems will be solved, you have to watch it. Although I think, that the movie is nice, I have expected too much from it. It is different than other movies, but it has a too expected and normal end, some would even say kitschy. To sum up, though I would everyone advice to watch this movie one time, because it is a classical movie, which have to be known by everyone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a simple guide to making a British Asian film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is a young Asian person. Their mother is religious and prone to bouts of hysteria, their father is a patriarch who stubbornly refuses to comprise to the culture he has emigrated to. They have brothers and sisters who are hypocritical in the way they play Asian at home to mum and dad but play British when out on the town with pals. One of those siblings will be having an arranged marriage soon. Our hero gets involved with white people and before you know it, the culture clash is threatening to tear their family apart. Why is it that a tragicomedy like East is East, a love story like Ae Fond Kiss, and an (alleged) comedy like Bend it Like Beckham are all written off the same template? Aren't there stories amongst the British Asian community other than the clash of generations?Lots of people seem to have had fun with this movie, most of them adding the caveat that if you don't take it too seriously and don't expect Shakespeare, you'll have a giggle. Except, this film just isn't funny. There isn't one laugh out loud moment in the whole film. Nagra is drop-dead gorgeous, and gives a charismatic performance, without which this film would be sunk completely. But where is the comedy?And why does football seem to be so much harder to portray realistically than other sports? The baseball in Bull Durham, the American Football in Titans, the golf in Tin Cup - they all seemed believable to me. Football on celluloid always looks fake as hell. Only 'Goal' managed to come close to pulling it off, though didn't quite manage it in the end. More from Nagra please, less from this writer/director.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>On the one hand the movie seems to be nothing special, but on the other hand I really liked it because the actors were so sympathetic and real. You can understand Jasminder and her feelings very well. The fact that the football match and the wedding of Jasminder's sister Pinky are on the same day is unrealistic, but such is life. There were many non-authentic football scenes in 'Bend it like Beckham',so children might like watching them but not real soccer fans. Another positive aspect of the film is the insight into Indian culture in London which is often portrayed in a very humorous way. You might think that David Beckham is also an actor in this movie but he only appears in a very short cameo role at the end of the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Yes, but where was Beckham?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My comments about this film are prejudiced, I admit it. Reason? The majority of the location shoots were all around the neighbourhood where I lived as a teenager, and where I still teach teenagers today. This means the film immediately engages me on a personal and non-cinematic level.One of the best British films of recent years, BILB manages to portray not only racial conflict, but also the tension that youth of all races have with traditional customs and parental expectations. With my familiarity of the area, and also its people, I can assure the viewer that on this level, the film works as accurately as a documentary might have, with the advantage that BILB is a whole lot more gripping.In an age of mindless teenage screen fodder, this film is funny, touching and refreshingly reflective. For any audience, the film works - for a teenage audience, however, it deserves a 10/10. I've given it an eight because I'm not a teenager, and I try to make my scores reflect general, cinema-literate audiences.A downside of the film structure is its pacing. It's a little uneven in its plot points, and worse still, I have yet to figure out the purpose or the plotting of the fight over the video camera. I saw it on first theatrical release, and perhaps I'm thick, but it simply made no sense at all even on re-play on video later.But the film's most serious flaw is its casting - or rather, its lack of casting. Simply put, where was Beckham? Although, according to IMDb.com, he was represented by uncredited stock footage, the Beckham of the title simply did a no-show for the movie. An absolutely unforgivable omission, one that deserves my pulling the film rating down a notch. But I'll refrain, since it was almost certainly David Beckham's refusal to co-operate. The very least he could have done would have been a visit to the film shoot, so at least some actuality footage could have been run over the closing titles, instead of the obligatory teen-flick "goof" footage. If I could vote for Beckham, he'd get a zero for disappointing an otherwise very good (proud-to-be multi-cultural) British film comedy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wonderful Movie! The humour is splendid, in part because of the "clash-of-cultures/generational gap/gender confusion" angles of the story, with the best lines delivered by the lovely, fresh-faced lead actresses. The Indian household scenes are especially funny! Anyone expecting solid football scenes (or a cameo by Beckham) will probably be only mildly disappointed; the quality of the performances and the writing will more than make up for it. The entire cast (an ensemble, actually) mesh together so well they could probably defeat an offside trap!It's good to know that the truly funny movies are coming from the smaller studios.</fullReview>

It's nothing like other chick flicks.This story takes place in the Indian inhabited part of England and the main character is a young Indian woman who still lives with her parents and loves soccer a lot.She hopes to become a professional someday. The only problem is that her parents are strict and forbid it. They go by the traditional Indian family rules and don't think women should play soccer.So she secretly plays soccer without them knowing it. And as the movie goes on she tries to talk sense into her family, that she should have more freedom in life.It's one of those movies that look like they're gonna suck, but when you watch it you'll be pleased with how it ends. It's unique and British/Indian girls are hot to admire.I recommend to those who do like women soccer related movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film works on several different levels, all of them excellent. The filmmakers successfully portray two young women who are brought alive through playing soccer, which is their greatest love; but both are struggling against the conventional values of their families. In the case of Jules, her mother is in despair about her daughter's apparent lack of interest in the opposite sex and unwillingness to behave or dress in a more feminine manner to make herself attractive. Jess, who is the main focus of the film, struggles to find herself as the daughter of a conventional Indian family. She yearns only to play soccer, at which she excels, but is conflicted because the demands of her family, which dictate other behavior for a good girl of this culture. The film provides good narrative tension, good insights into the Indian culture, as well as terrific acting by all the main characters, some very exciting soccer scenes, and a romance - and with Jonathan Rhys-Meyers, how can you miss?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love this movie. It is great film that combines English and Indian cultures with feminist-type issues, such as girls wanting to play sports that were previously reserved for men. It shows the struggles of both an Indian person wanting to break outside her cultural barriers and women wanting to break outside the gender restrictions found in sports, especially in England at the time. I feel that the cultural struggles are more emphasized than the other issues.In contrast to the other comment, I do not think this movie is anything like Dirty Dancing or any other such chick flick.

		<shortDescription>You'll Warm Up to This Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For a while, I sat blank staring at the screen wondering why my friends had forced me to watch this film. But after that point, I wondered why nobody had made me see it sooner.You will have to adjust to the characters and possibly the accent (if you're American), but once you do, you will fall in love with these characters. The plot is simple: a girl wants to be a professional soccer player, but her family thinks it is not right for women to pursue soccer. You may not have strict parents or a love for soccer, but we all know what it's like to have goals and face the obstacles we must face in order to achieve them.By the way, it's Keira Knightley. She's a little thin for my liking in this movie, but her acting is fine, and heck - it's Keira Knightley, probably the biggest rising star in England today. You know you can't get enough of her (especially if you've seen "The Jacket").What I really liked is the angle of Indian and Sikh culture. That's certainly not what you expect from a soccer film. But it's all here: the weddings, the music, the weird old man in the weird painting... a little background in Sikhism or Indian culture would be helpful, but not necessary to enjoy this film.You can do worse. Recommended to watch if you're in a bonding situation (especially if you're two girls) or might be a lesbian. Everyone else, you can watch this film, too. I'm not a lesbian, and I enjoyed it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>bend it's scored my favorites</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of my all time favorite movies and I would recommend it to anyone. On my list of favorite movies (mental list, mind) the only ones on par with it are movies such as The Lord of the Rings series, Spirited Away and Fly Away Home.I can really relate to the main character Jess. At the start of the movie she's a shy girl with a slightly odd background who has a lot more friends who are boys than that are girls. She really sucks you into her life. I also certainly can't fault any of the protagonist's acting, or anyone else's in the film.The soccer was interesting to watch even for someone like me who has no idea of the rules. The movie is never boring. The romance is really cute and didn't make me blush tooooo hard! One thing that really made it though was the Indian factor. Jess' parents are Indian and there are many colourful Indian conventions throughout the film providing a very interesting cultural insight as well as everything else. The Indian people are also hilarious! Essentially this is a coming of age film about choosing the path you want and fighting for it.Feel good comedies are becoming my favorite movie genre thanks to this film. They're funny, they're refreshing and they make you feel good! ^_~</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wanna take off ? Hounslow's a good place to start</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gurinda Chada's semi-autobiographical film (2002) is a gentle, poignant comedy set in the ethnically diverse community near Heahthrow Airport in West London.Like the airliners which constantly arrive and depart from overhead, we follow the ups and downs of the two main characters Jess Bhamra (Parminder Nagra) and Jules Paxton (Keira Knightley) as they strike up an unlikely friendship which centres around their mutual passion for soccer and their technical infatuation with David Beckham.Much of the comedy grows out of the misunderstandings of the families of these two talented girls as they break all the expectations and conventions of their very different family backgrounds.Somewhere in the middle, as broker, peacemaker and blighted athlete, Joe (Jonathan Reece-Myers) - team coach for the Hounslow Harriers - intercedes in times of crisis, while at the same time remaining the main object of affection of both the main characters.Eventually, and not without many obstacles and triumphs on the way, we finally see our dedicated and beloved soccer heroines soaring away to realise their dreams.With great performances from Bollywood veteran Anupam Kher (Mr Bhamra), Shaheen Khan (Mrs Bhamra), Juliet Stevenson (Mrs Paxton) and Frank Harper (Mr Paxton) this really is a film that captures the urgent passion of adolescence and crosses all ethnic frontiers.Pinky Bamrha (Archie Panjabi) and (Taz) Trey Farley are struggling their own struggles, but nevertheless contribute greatly to our understanding of the main characters in the film.In it's own special way, this film tells an important story that in quite incidental the football. It celebrates the evolution in the understanding of ordinary people in ordinary families and the innate ability of the young to teach the old.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bend it Like Beckham=Heart Warming Comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first heard about Bend it Like Beckham, I automatically stuck my nose up to it because of the fact it contained soccer. But one day I actually sat down and watched it, and it turns out it's fantastic.The story centers on Jesminder, an Indian girl who has just graduated from high school. Her entire life lives and breathes soccer, as demonstrated in her room decor and the opening sequence of the movie. Her overbearing parents do not allow her to play soccer, so when she is asked to join the women's team, she must hide it. Jess' parents think that it is improper for an Indian girl to play soccer and she must focus on school work, marrying a nice Indian boy, and making perfect Aloo Gobi. To make matters worse, her family is consumed with the plans for her sister Pinky's wedding, and Jess's grades in order to get into University. Pinky's wedding takes a little bit of focus of Jess, and with the help of her best friends Juliette (Keira Knightly before Pirates) and Tony, helps change the minds of her parents. This is a great movie for anyone who likes sports, comedy, romance, etc. and also includes an awesome soundtrack. There is very little cursing (mostly "bloody") and little to no sexual innuendo/comments. Not to mention the eye candy for the females (Jess' coach Joe (Jonathan Rhys Meyers) is quite fit.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An interesting and amusing approach to cultural conflict.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I sat down to watch this film I actually expected quite a bit, as the plot takes on quite complex issues. Using football as launching pad for the complication also was an interesting approach. Still unfortunately, despite its bravery of dealing with controversial issues as culture clashes between Muslim and western culture, adding generation conflicts and prejudice towards gays/lesbians, it lets you down towards the resolution with a rather simplistic relief to all the suspense built up throughout the film. This leads me to the impression that the makers took on a little too big a task for themselves to tackle, attempting to be more profound then they managed to deal with.However, this does not mean that the film is directly bad, as it's rendering of the conflicts where quite believable and also amusing. The film succeeds in being engaging and entertaining in this matter, but as mentioned above the writers seem to have spun themselves a little too deep. This has led to some quite unrealistic character behaviour towards the end to confront the surging conflicts. By this dropping the ball at a time where the makers could really have shown brilliance taking the film to another level of appreciation.Even if the film does at no point really attempt to be a profound piece of drama, the setting has so much potential in the plot it becomes a disappointment when "the ball drops". This way the film moves from being a good and reflected comedy to a standard cliché that becomes ridiculous in its happy-ending. Nothing is left out in the Hollywood like ending. So even if the story is engaging and one can stomach the large amount of montages, one can't help but roll eyes towards the resolution. Personally I was close to shouting "finish already!!" at the screen.There were some decent acting in the film, and the two young female central characters had some good moments. So did their parents and other bi-characters. However the handsome Irish coach was an embarrassing piece of acting, that lets the film down quite a bit in terms of realism. He didn't even appear very likable, but rather self involved despite his good deeds, which makes the impending conflict between the girls seem a little strained.I give the film a 4, as it was an engaging story and they sought out a nice perspective to approach the subject from. The script and cast had many good believable characters, giving the audience a chance to recognise either themselves or others. Had the let-downs not been this disappointing, I'd easily give the film a 7 or 8. If you enjoyed this film, I'd recommend the film "East is East", which I think is an as good, if not better rendering of cultural conflict, as well as being amusing and engaging.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a so called 'feel-good' movies, however it made me sad in a way. Why? Because I had the talent, but my parents didn't let me study at the sports academy, as well the fact that at the age of 12 I decided to quit soccer.And soccer is the red line in this movie. Together with the struggle youngsters have with the expectations parents have. An English-Indian girl and her parents, with their traditions and strong family ties, and on the other hand the English family with a daugther who dresses like a boy, and plays soccer... a combination which worries her mother! This movie also lines out the lives of ordinary people, as well as the Indian community in England. It is about believe in your dreams, and live your one life (where did we hear that before).Paraminder Nagra (a beautiful women!) plays Yasminda, a girl who is not interested in boys, new clothes, make-up and the typical 17 year old girl stuff. In contradiction with her sister Pinky, complete the opposite of Yasminda.A real must it is, to see how a young beautiful girl struggles with the traditions of their parents, and finds her luck eventually. With great music from Blondie, Curtis Mayfield, Texas, Melanie C, as well as Indian hit songs.Pleasant to watch, but if you, as myself, ever played soccer, and never made it to the top, then this movie will make you melachonic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Sense and Sensibility" meets "Soccer for (Indian) girls"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Originally I rented this film for my daughter since she is keen on soccer - and I was not disappointed that way (except the plot interfered with the soccer scenes). As a dad I suppose I was a little surprised at the introduction of the topic of lesbianism - but I have to admit that as a parent these issues are completely available to children nowadays (as uncomfortable as I feel with the topic). In a way this emotion was a segue right into the main premise of the film - that at some age you must trust your children to make their own choices. This dilemma is introduced by a young British-born teen girl - Jasminder (Jess) - of east-Indian heritage who dreams of playing professional soccer. The pending marriage of her older sister in a traditional Hindu marriage provides many rich opportunities for her to explore (in a nice way) her hopes and fears for her future. The multi-cultural challenge was a very interesting technique to explore Jess's frustration with her parents expectations for her - again no different in substance than most child-parent relationships. In SUMMARY, the soccer scenes are GREAT (lots to learn in slowmo) and while I didn't need the storyline - something was needed to keep the movie going.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What surprised me most about this film was the sheer audience it attracted. Similar films such as Anita and Me have never caused as much hype as this film has, though I think that's probably because of the mention of 'Beckham' in the title more than anything else.It's a brilliant film putting across a brilliant message - you can do anything if you're determined enough, and put your mind to it, which is such a positive message to anyone watching this film.I think this is one of Keira Knightley's better films, and I think she's a brilliant actress, and was excellent for the role. Parminder Nagra was brilliant too. Sadly, I can't say this for Jonathan Rhys-Meyers, because I don't think that he was that much of a good actor, and to be honest, his eyes were a little scary.All in all, a brilliant film, and a brilliant story</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched this movie 3 times, and it had been fun each time. Now I must confess that I'm no film critic, nor did I expect to see a great movie when I rented the DVD; so I was not disappointed either.The few things that I liked about/noticed in this movie were: 1) Mothers are mothers; they are all alike than different. Being white, black, green, violet or anything else has nothing to do with it; nor does it change anything.2) We all have stereotypes, and rarely can one be devoid of prejudices. In the same way that an Indian can be a Paki to a white, British girl, an Irish,and a British are one and the same for an Indian Punjabi woman,or for that matter, a Punjabi woman (Jess's mother; in real life, perhaps either an Indian or a Pakistani Muslim woman) thinks that its different for the Muslims, even when one talks about someone such as Nasir Hussain, the then England Cricket Captain.My most favorite artiste in the movie: Juliet Stevenson. Great acting, excellent facial expressions! Note: 1) "Gora" is not an insulting word or a slur. "Gora" literary means "white" (or even "fair" as in complexion, at times!). "Gora badan" is an oft-used/abused term of endearment in Hindi movies.2) The bearded man (in the picture on the wall) is not just some spiritual guy; he's Guru Nanak, the founder of Sikhism. This reminds me of a slogan (on a tee-shirt) I saw in New York:"My Boss is a Jewish Carpenter". Well, for the Sikhs, their Boss is a bearded old man.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No Big Deal, But Utterly Enjoyable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Bend It Like Beckham" reminds me of the best of those 80's teeny-bopper movies directed by John Hughes. Everything takes place in a bubble-gum colored world where everyone is attractive, there are some easily-resolved conflicts that occasionally take away from the mostly happy proceedings, and vast amounts of plot are summarized by montages set to bouncy pop tunes. Nothing wrong with this, however. "Bend It Like Beckham" is an absolute treat from beginning to end. My wife and I found ourselves totally won over by the cornball cheesiness even as we were making fun of it, and at the end, as embarrassing as this is to admit, we applauded (and we saw this, by the way, in our living room, not in a theatre). Watch this movie and enjoy.Grade: B+</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Nagra comes from conservative Indian family that isn't exactly into girls playing competitive soccer. But our attractive young star CAN play some serious soccer. Rhys-Meyers coaches Nagra and encourages her to perform, while Knightley is supportive teammate and friend. When sis' wedding is scheduled for the same day as the ultimate soccer match, what's a girl to do? Similar in its own unique way to BFGW as Nagra tries to push the envelope on traditional family ways. Here it's dad (well-played by Kher) who can see both sides of the issue. Docked an entire point for a hokey late sexual preference non-crisis, if they needed filler they could have gone elsewhere. Nice final wrap up to the whole deal.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not one of your harder-hitting stories, and that's a real strength of this film. There are at least two relationships in which less confident writers would have added some all-too predictable romantic tension. They not only spare the audience this, but throw in some surprises at the same time. There are a few Disney-ish moments, particularly near the end, but they are manageable. Overall, it was worth the rental and it was good, relaxed fun.BTW, if you get the DVD, watch the segment where the director teaches you how to make aloo gobi. We followed her directions and it was BRILLIANT! Next time we will make it the day before we plan to eat it, because this is one dish that definitely gets better with a full night in the fridge to let the spices out!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Bend It Like Beckham" is a film that got very little exposure here in the United States. It was probably due to the fact that the movie was strongly British in dialogue and terminology and dealt a lot with football, (soccer here), which some may have trouble relating too in the U.S. It's unfortunate because this movie is absolutely fantastic and deserved much more coverage over here. I think the basis of the storyline, (following a dream), is something many people can relate to and in the end, "Bend It Like Beckham" proves to be a good-feeling film with a source of inspiration and really good acting. I was not overly excited about seeing this film initially but now I regret not seeing it sooner. I highly recommend this movie!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To "Bend It Like Beckham" may not mean much to us Americans who know very little about the other football (soccer), but to English sports fans, it is equivalent to "Hit it Like Bonds" or "Dunk it Like Jordan." Any young soccer player dreams of bending a soccer ball around one player and into the net for a goal, much like star player David Beckham does, much like the young Indian girl, Jess (Parminder Nagra), does in the film Bend It Like Beckham. Jess loves to play pick up soccer games, the kind forbidden by her traditionalist mother. However, while playing one day, a passing friend named Jules (Keira Knightley) sees her play and invites her to try out for a traveling, all girls soccer team. After satisfying the coach Joe (Jonathan Rhys-Meyers), she makes the team, something she knows her mother would not approve of. The movie is not about disobeying parents, but rather a girl doing what she wants to do, even if that goes against culture, not just the parents. There is humor thrown throughout the movie, especially when Jules' mother thinks she's a lesbian. The movie does resort to a bit of a cliché moment, as the big soccer game is the same day as Jess' sister's wedding, but it does not come off a cheesy, but rather fun and light. The soccer action looks good, so sports fans will enjoy it, and a story about girls growing up in a boy's world, the world of soccer will inspire some in the audience. Bend It Like Beckham is not just about soccer, but rather a girl trying to find herself and please her parents at the same time, something that proves to be rather difficult.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this with few expectations and absolutely loved it! Bend it like Beckham is a fairly typical coming-of-age movie about a fairly atypical girl. This is Parminder Nagra ("ER")'s breakout role, playing Jess, a teenager in England who is caught between her traditional Indian family and her love of football (that's soccer to us North Americans). And even though she's actually much older than her character, she plays the role pitch-perfect.This is a movie about friendship - specifically Jess's friendship with Jules (Keira Knightley), her teammate who is also going through family issues, especially with her mom, who wears purple nail polish and little bows on her shoes, and who wants Jules to be more feminine, wear lacy underwear and flirt with boys and is terrified that playing sports means her daughter is a lesbian. Jules and Jess both love playing the game and have issues trying to convince their families to let them go after their dreams. They also, unfortunately, both love the same man - Joe, their coach (played by Jonathan Rhys-Meyers). The love triangle causes some strain in their friendship.In some spots, Bend It Like Beckham falls into clichés. In others, scenes drag on far too long, and this movie probably could have benefited from overall tighter editing.But this was a refreshingly fun film about growing up, culture clash, and the love of football. It's about female empowerment, chasing your dreams, and supporting your friends. Funny, charming and fun, Bend It Like Beckham is the little film that could... and did.Excellent. 8/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I caught this movie while flipping through the cable channels and was instantly mesmerized. It is about a teenage Indian girl (nicknamed Jesse) in London who loves soccer and hopes to play for the British woman's team. The problem is her family still believes that women are married early and have many kids and do not delve into distractions like games. Therefore, Jesse must sneak away to attend practices. She develops a friendship with one of her teammates and generally loves the new world she has entered.Meanwhile Jesse's sister has had her engagement arranged. Jesse gets in big trouble when she hugs her teammate in a bus stop and the parents of the groom happen by in car. They see Jesse's teammate from the back and think that it is an "English boy." They go to Jesse's parents and want to call the wedding off because a proper Indian woman would never do something like that. Jesse is forced to tell her parents that she is playing soccer and that the "boy" was really her teammate and nothing happened between them. Her parents tell her to stop this soccer business and prepare herself to be a proper Indian wife. Her father tells her that he was once prevented from playing cricket because he is Indian, so he has vowed to never let sports become an important part of his life.Jesse has to sneak away to attend a big game in Germany. There things get rocky between herself and her teammate because they are both competing for the affections of their coach. He seems to favor Jesse because he has had similar problems with his own parents who think it is unmanly to coach women's soccer. Of course the game is so big that the team's picture is put in the newspaper and Jesse's parents find out. Jesse must decide if she will do what her parents want or follow the ways of her own heart.The Indian culture is well presented with lots of colorful costumes and jubilant celebrations. Also, there is a lot of well placed comic relief such as the painting of an Indian wise man that everyone seems to talk to for advice and Jesse's teammate's parents think that they are having a love affair because their daughter hugs Jesse and is very athletic and likes to wear pants.All in all, a movie that when it ends you want it to never stop!</fullReview>

Even though the story is simple in it's basic telling (Indian female teen wants to play soccer and go against her cultural traditions), there are many more issues at play that will entertain you from both a comedic and dramatic standpoint. It is more about pursuing ones dreams and coming to grips with what matters most in one's life. I give this one a 9/10.</fullReview>

It's not a "chick flick" either - my fiance loved the story despite all his groaning before he saw it. Of course there is even something very sensual in the soccer scenes or when the girls are working out. The only thing that detracted for me was the bit of contrived romance and the British accents are VERY thick. You DO NOT need to be a soccer fan to see the movie and you DO NOT need to be familiar with Indian culture. The movie will provide all of the background you will need. See this movie!</fullReview>

The Indian culture seems to interfere with Jess's dreams of playing football (soccer in US). She does not want to upset the family but she doesn't want to miss out on her chance either. Her family wants her to be something she isn't....The coach "Joe" is a cutie. I do not know where people get their information on how he looks like a young Tom Cruise when he really looks like a young, young Elvis Presley. He has the eyes of Elvis and could pass for Lisa Marie's younger brother.....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Really a different movie than I thought. I'm glad I've seen it!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first heard of this movie here in Spain in June 2003, but I wasn't really interested in it. It sounded to me like another stupid soccer movie, in order to give more money to Beckham (I can't stand soccer). But things changed when I went to the States in July. The 13-year-old girl in my host family wanted to see it at the cinema, so I went with her and her friends. Then I changed my mind and realized it was a very good movie and had nothing to do with what I thought. It combines sport, culture and life in a comedy way, and relates the increasing of culture problems and their religious differences when they have to coexist in our world. The central storyline is that Jess (Parminder K. Nagra), a Hindu girl, defies her family's expectations by playing soccer in a girl's team. Jess's English friend Jules (Keira Knightley), who is 16, also has problems with her mother, who tells her to be more feminine and stop playing soccer like a boy. Of course, there are love aspects. Both girls like the same boy, their coach Joe (Jonathan Rhys-Meyers), and that gives more interest and appeal to the movie. I especially liked Bend it like Beckham because it shows a certain point of view: the description of our world nowadays by contrasting two cultures coexisting in London, such as the occidental one and the Hindu habits. There are some aspects that are the same in most cultures, like mothers don't wanting their daughters to play soccer or do boy's activities. This is reflected in Jess, who, with a great potential in soccer, can't make at first her dream come true because of her culture.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A winning film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Bend it Like Beckham" is a feel-good movie in the best sense of the term--by the time the credits roll, you're smiling. The requirements for such a movie are simple: the characters must be likable, they must be played convincingly enough for us to care about them, and what happens to them must be interesting enough to hold our attention. Director Gurinder Chadha succeeds on all counts here, creating a joyful celebration of sport, culture, and family.The clash between traditional values and modern desires has been done often--"My Big Fat Greek Wedding" being another recent example--but there's a bit more here than that. "Beckham" is an exploration of expectations--from family, friends, culture, and religion--and what happens when those expectations become challenged. The central story of Jess (Parminder Nagra) defying her family's expectations by playing soccer is echoed several ways throughout the film. Jess' friend Jules (Keira Knightley) also faces objections from her mother, who thinks Jules should act more feminine--a belief that causes her to greatly misconstrue Jules' relationship with Jess. Their coach Joe (Jonathan Rhys-Meyers), meanwhile, has dealt with the inverse: the expectation that he be a strong man and a good athlete. He too has suffered by trying to please his parents too much, so Joe and Jess seem to be kindred spirits--but Jules, who thinks her attraction to Joe is unmistakable, sees this as a betrayal on Jess' part.The movie doesn't really contain any surprises in the story, but it's all handled skillfully by Chandha. The soccer scenes in particular are deftly woven into the plot, creating excellent commentary and counterpoint to the action. There's a particularly good sequence after Jules sees her friend and coach together, an act she regards as a betrayal. While the game goes on, Jules and Jess are all business--they pass, kick, and score without any indication anything's wrong. But in the close-ups, Chandha reveals the anger and resentment in Knightley's eyes, and the sadness and guilt in Nagra's. The bitterness isn't spilling over into the game, but it hasn't ceased to exist.The cast is excellent, with Nagra as an appealing lead and Rhys-Meyers making an unconventionally attractive love interest. And even if "Bend it Like Beckham" doesn't break the rules of film, at least it plays well and scores often.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(spoilers)Was a bit worried this movie was gonna be too much of a girly movie. Well it sorta is, but it was a delight to watch. out main star is just wonderful. She looks 18, but I think she's much older, she musta been 24 or so when making the film. One of those uplifting movies very similar to Whale Rider, where the main star breaks with tradition and goes her own path. Though not quite as good as Whale Rider, it's still the same string. It has some elements of Fiddler on the Roof here as far as the marriage plot goes. I kinda wish there was more fun in america too, but it was alright where it ended.The reviews seem to make it like it's a hilarious movie. Sure it's funny here and there, but it's a total drama. And I liked it.10/10Quality: 9/10 Entertainment: 10/10 Replayable: 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Heartwarming Gem (SPOILERS)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I found Bend it Like Beckham to be both funny and completely outrageous...very entertaining. I completely adore Keira Knightley and in work she expresses the same wonderfully sassy and salty personality expressed by Brooke Shields in her early films and she's also very beautiful. Bend it Like Beckham has an earthy raw quality which I also enjoyed. Very refreshing. An excellent film depicting the upsurge of 'meaningless' culture clashes and the problems faced by the religions when having to deal with it.Maybe not completely realistic but engaging and thought provoking nonetheless. I thought of Bend it Like Beckham as a good movie. I started watching this movie expecting it to be just another teen football (as in soccer) movie that the stupid MPAA gave an PG-13 rating to. After 10 minutes or more, this film actually started getting interesting. Through the whole movie I was either saying `Why would she do that?' or `That did not just happen!' and at some parts I was even laughing, believe it or not because there was actually a touch of comedy in it. When I first began watching this movie, I didn't think it would be good. After spending 10 minutes of my time to see the first bits of the movie, I was glued to the silver screen. This movie was excellent in all ways. The characters where interesting and believable, the plot had you on the edge of your seat, and the ending has you in disbelief. If you ever get the chance, I highly recommend that you see this movie, it is definitely worth your time. With all the football, and serious parts in this movie, Gurinder Chadha, the writer, threw in some comedy to loosen you up. Jess (Parminder K. Nagra) shows an excellent performance and Jules plays what a real 16 year old girl might think. I liked the part when Jules' mom thought Jules was a lesbian with Jess because she heard them arguing over a their coach, who they both like. After watching this, the only thing I could say was "Wow!" I was looking for a movie to watch and there was nothing on so I just chose Bend it Like Beckham'. And I started watching it. I thought it was going to be a very stupid movie with no plot, but it is a great movie. Although I do not like Jonathan Rhys-Meyers, he didn't bother me in this film. This movie contained the best acting in a British movie I have ever seen (by Parminder K. Nagra). That alone makes it worth the watch. It's also a great debut for Parminder K. Nagra and Gurinder Chadha, and make a very sharp point about our world, in a humorous way... something that's very hard to do but is done very well. I may be alone in this, but I think it's one of the best films I've seen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A thoroughly charming movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is often difficult enough for young people to overcome preconceptions on what they should do, what they should wear etc. When the preconceptions are those of a Sikh family living in Britain - and the teenager is a girl who wants to play football, there is no easy way for both sides to see the others' point of view.The problem is treated with humour and compassion in this delightful comedy, well cast and equally well acted - showing the immense difference in ideas between a family steeped in tradition and those of a daughter, brought up in a country where girls are able to do pretty much what they like. Then again there is a native British family where the mother's ideas of what a daughter should be doing (clothes, boys, makeup) clash considerably with her daughter's wish to excel at what is considered fine for a boy - and strange for a girl.Although the stereotypes are somewhat overdone, the movie as a whole is entertaining - with the problems solved pretty much to everyone's satisfaction. I loved it - and thoroughly recommend it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Before I saw this movie, and only judged it by the preview or trailer I felt as if i didn't really want to watch it and that it looked sort of boring. I'm so glad, I got to watch it in a friend's house because she liked it already. I love the movie and the movie really, is that good especially since many of the movie's key points are so related to life today. Life of a girl who has great potential in Soccer and just needed a small push in the right direction.Many movies, fail to display many different movie genres, and this movie happened to be able to display, Comedy and romance.The gradualism of the lead character Jess's feelings for her coach Joe who I must add is drop dead gorgeous and has the sexiest accent in the whole wide universe. Besides, its romantic values both their relationship with each other displays inter-racial boundaries that they aren't too worried of crossing.Many teenage girls, stride to achieve what Jess does and i think that's role model worthy.This movie, is worth watching and is one of my favorite films. Watch it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>&amp;#9788;&amp;#9788;&amp;#9788;&amp;#9788; (Four out of Four Suns)WARNING: may be spoilers, so beware! (but probably not)The film Bend it Like Beckham is about an Indian girl who has to balance her family and her dream. Gurinder Chandha has done a very good job of writing a cohesive and flowing script. The storyline has been cleverly thought out. Throughout the whole movie, there is the recurring theme of whether to fight in a situation or to just let go.Parminder Nagra does a great job of playing the role Jess, the girl torn between her dream of bending it like Beckham or abiding by her families wishes. Keira Knightley does a fabulous job as one of Jess' teammates named Jules. Their friendship is a constant storyline threaded throughout the story. Jonathan Rhys Meyers plays Joe, Jess' and Jules' soccer coach. Frank Harper and Juliet Stevenson are hilarious as Jules' mom and dad.Gurinder Chadha has done a really good job of directing this film. Jong Lin, the director of photography has created some scenes that will be remembered long after you see the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fairly original romance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a story of an Indian girl, Jess, in London, who dreams of playing soccer, but her family is against it. One day she's approached by a girl, Jules, who plays on a girl's soccer team, to join them. So, she does and tries to hide her soccer playing from her family. Along the way, her coach Joe, presses her to try to play professionally in America and (this is the part that didn't make sense) he falls for her. My question is why her. There were a lot of girls on the team and of course, her best friend, Jules had the hots for Joe first.So along the way, we get a lot of laughs, mostly having to do with Jess's Indian family and what they think is proper for a girl to do. The mom was very funny. Also, Jules mom had her moments when she thinks her daughter is a lesbian. Also, when friends of Jess's parents mistake Jules for a guy and Jess is scolded for "kissing" a boy in public. Something she never did.I have to say the music was good throughout. There are a lot of up beat songs you can sing along to.FINAL VERDICT: The would be a good pick if you're looking for a funny romantic comedy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had heard great things about this movie and have been wanting to see it for a while. I have seen Ms. Nagra on ER as Neela and I am impressed with her performance so I decided it was finally time to see this movie. It was definitely with seeing. My perception of Ms. Nagra has only gotten better and I hope to see her in more movies and of course as Neela in ER.I had enjoyed Kiera Knightly in the Pirates of the Caribbean so it was another reason to see Bend it Like Beckham. I thought that both of these actresses did a fantastic job and I hope to see them more often.Jonathan Rhys Meyers.... WOW! He is hot. When I first saw him I knew I had seen him in another movie, so as soon as the movie was finished I looked him up. He was in The Governess with Minnie Driver and I actually remembered his face. He had only a small roll in that film, but for some reason I remembered his face, and what a gorgeous face it is. He also did a fantastic job.But overall this film was hilarious and I enjoyed every minute of it. I'm not a big sports fan, but soccer is probably my favorite sport because I use to play it, but was never that good. The soundtrack is also awesome. I love all different types of music and I really loved the music throughout the film. It was interesting although I didn't know what they were saying.Overall this film is a MUST SEE! I would recommend it to anyone. I rented it one night and went out and bought it the next day. It's great so rent and watch it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Is there any more worn-out genre than that of the sports film? With the exception of Ron Shelton films (`Bull Durham', `White Men Can't Jump', `Tin Cup'), the only decent one on the last decade was Spike Lee's `He Got Game', which dealt more with father-son relationships than actual sporting events (I'm not counting the wonderful `Kingpin' as a sports film here). Either we get bland and dull kiddie fare like `The Mighty Ducks' and `Air Bud', or we get unimaginative grown-up fare like the noisy `Any Given Sunday' and the sappy `The Legend of Bagger Vance'. `Bend It Like Beckham' is not only another sports film, but it's one made in Britain, set in the world of football (in America, British football is known as the never very mainstream game of professional soccer), and references in the title an English athlete most Americans have never heard of (David Beckham, the Michael Jordan of British football, who is married to former Posh Spice Victoria Beckham). What a wonderful surprise, then, this movie winds up being such a treat for all ages, a sports film that looks beyond the big game to the relationships of those playing it.Jess (Parminder K. Nagra) is a teen girl of the strict Sikh faith who loves playing football. Of course it is forbidden by her family, so when she is spotted in a park by Jules (Keira Knightley), who plays for the local girls' team, an invitation to try out is both alluring and forbidden. Jess makes the team, becomes friends with Jules, develops a crush on her coach Joe (Jonathan Rhys-Meyers), and spends the summer hiding her passion from her family as she prepares for college and her sister's wedding.None of this is new or unique on paper, but the film keeps finding new ways to present the material. The uneasy relationship between the Punjabi and Caucasian communities in Britian is one new idea, and the fact that Jess and Jules are such distinctive, well-drawn characters helps as well. As Jess fights with her dad (Anupam Kher) to be able just to play, Jules has to subvert her mother's (Juliet Stevenson) belief that female athletes must be lesbians. This is a borderline-offensive concept played a little too broadly, but it does result in a wonderful payoff near the end of the film.Jess' continuous lies and battles to play her game lends the film its drama, as does the dueling crushes Jess and Jules have for their coach, who would be fired if he fooled around with one of his players. By disobeying her parents and playing, Jess is violating scared tenets her faith is built around, and the fact that she might throw so much away over a game gives the film true and powerful tension. Her parents are not drawn as caricatures, like Jules' folks (her father loves the idea of her playing football if it keeps her out of trouble with boys), and their real outrage over her behavior and fear for her future gives the film power. They could never allow her to play, really, a concept fraught with sadness but resolved realistically.The film plays like a fairy tale, complete with a storybook ending that some may decry as false and sappy. But this film and these girls earn that ending, and only a crank who has forgotten their own youth could not only not smile at the final scenes, but also not want to see them happen. Nagra is a revelation here, a stunningly beautiful girl who seems so shy and unhappy but just shines when kicking the ball. Knightley, a doppleganger for Natalie Portman, is also beautiful and wonderful in her role; these two girls play off of each other and the script in a way I have not seen for a long time. Kher is also a joy as Jess' father, taking a character that could have been shallow and giving him more depth than can be imagined. Director Gurinder Chadra, working from a script he co-wrote with Paul Mayeda Berges, is a veteran filmmaker making his first big splash in America, and he makes every last moment of this film a treasure.This film, despite receiving a PG-13 rating that seems entirely inappropriate (nothing here warrants more than a PG), is being marketed towards young girls. Don't be fooled: this is a film for everyone, regardless of age or gender. I barely know Manchester United from the Chicago Fire or Pele from Mia Hamm, but I know great movies. `Bend It Like Beckham' is a blast of fresh air, a film so filled with joy that you cannot resist its charms.</fullReview>

It was a very "cute" movie to watch, but didn't have much to qualify it as something really special (or brilliant --- a word they FREQUENTLY use in the movie).Altogether the movie is a pleasing one (though I would have preferred for Joe to end up with Keira Knightley's character), and most all of it hangs together, without serious plot goofs.So my advice is: Definitely watch it, but be prepared for a cute, semi-feministic, side-splitting soccer comedy</fullReview>

		<fullReview>BEND IT LIKE BECKHAM (2002)THE GOOD:--The two leads - Parminder Nagra and Keira Knightley - are beautiful girls and rising stars. I loved both of their performances and they had a great chemistry together, I was really sold on their friendship, and they also did a very plausible job of conflict between friends over a romantic interest.--This isn't a completely original film, yet - like "Billy Elliot" - it takes the premise and does something unique with it. With "Bend it Like Beckham" we are given the difficulties of balancing culture and hobbies, shown very well with Jess's character. On several occasions throughout the film Jess must make the choice whether to carry on with her soccer training or do what is more important for her culture and family.--The sport soccer to me has never really been that appealing. It's OK to play around with a soccer ball once every so often but watching it isn't exactly my idea of entertainment. However, the creative director gives us some exhilarating soccer sequences and makes the sport seem like a lot of fun, to watch and to play.--This movie is very funny and all ages will be entertained by the mature humour. My personal favourites were the parents of both Jules and Jess; they were just a crack up. Alan and Paula, Jules' parents, were very funny, especially Paula. I loved the scenes where she was distressed because she thought Jules was a lesbian. And her later reaction - "I have nothing against it at all." - just makes the whole scenario that much funnier. The Indian parents with their strong accents, cultural ways and strictness on their daughters were also very humorous, though I also appreciated how both of them (especially the father) were given some depth. I liked the scene where Jess' dad revealed to her how his culture was made fun of when he tried to play sport - that was kind of sad and certainly added some depth to his character.THE BAD:--All the good things said, the place this movie falters is in following the formula too much with the romantic side of things. The romantic storyline is all too familiar and extremely predictable.RATING:8/10 - An extremely fun, crowd-pleasing feel-good movie that will stand the test of time.IF YOU LIKED THIS MOVIE I RECOMMEND:10 Things I Hate About You (8/10) Air Bud (7/10) Billy Elliot (8/10) Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (9/10) Save the Last Dance (6/10)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As mentioned, it is similar to other films such as My Big Fat Greek Wedding... But its similarity is quite ok with me. Greek Wedding was pretty cool as is this movie.An Irony from my perspective is that the main character's trials are strikingly similar in scope to a very good friend- and the choices between tradition and modern are a compromise for her every day. Good lord knows she tries to accomidate everyone... (like the movie's character).Very good movie, more true than some realize and well worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A really charming film, even if, as an American, I care little for soccer. This film is set in what looks to be a VERY prosperous Indian/Sikh immigrant community in a London suburb. Very good work by the entire cast, but particularly for the star, Parminder Nagra. I saw her understated charm in her recent role on "ER" so I decided to check out this movie. She was worth it. Yes, many of the same themes were explored in the recent "Real Women Have Curves" although that one carried a rather harder edge. This is a feel-good movie, and even if the plot turns were somewhat formulaic, they were done very well. I recommend. Grade: A-</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Once in a while, a film comes along that has a plot you've seen a million times before, but it wins you over. Bend it Like Beckham was one of those films for me. It has an inescapable charm and lovable, relatable characters, which lead to an all around great movie.You don't have to like soccer/football to enjoy this movie. It's basically a story about a girl who simply wants to achieve her dream, even if it means going against those around her. In her case, it's her conservative family and their customs.Parminder K. Nagra does a great acting job as the main character of Jesse. Her family is full of characters, from her mother to her sister. But they are grounded in reality. I'll bet you'll see some of your family in her family.Other commendable acting was done by the attractive Keira Knightly, who plays Juliette, Jesse's best friend through soccer, Juliette's mother who thinks she's a lesbian, and Jesse's love interest played by Jonathan Rhys-Meyers.So if you're looking for a good movie, full of humor and charm, go Bend it Like Beckham.</fullReview>

And this also is a bit the plot of the story, it's the story of an Indian girl who is a talented female footballplayer who has two handicaps : she's a girl (football is a man's sport) and she is coming from a culture in where football is seeing as complete waste of time.

		<shortDescription>Never give up your dream</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Synopsis Spoiler! If you do not understand this title, you are not alone, because I didn't understand it either. The title is a football or soccer term used in England. This is a British comedy with mostly unknown actors to America. The movie is about the trials and tribulations of an Indian teenage girl (Parminder Nagra) playing football on a girl's team without the knowledge of her orthodox Sikh parents. The daughter must do what the parents want her to do because her parents follow the customs and traditions of India. However, since they live and work in London, the customs of England come into play with their children. The conflict of these two cultures runs throughout the movie. There are some really funny and true to life scenes in the movie. The wedding scene is one of the best scenes of the movie. The girl's sister is getting married during the championship game and she must choose between the wedding and her family or playing in the game. If you haven't seen an Indian wedding before, this movie will give you a chance to see their wedding customs and their colorful cloths.I have seen the movie twice and it was still very good the second time. Not too many films have a moral to the story but this one does, which is to never give up your dream. I believe that this film is the sleeper movie of the year and I recommend this film for the whole family. Soccer players will love it and your friends will too. 8/10</fullReview>

Granted, I'm female and grew up playing soccer so I might have a bias, but I enjoyed this movie immensely. The acting was believable, and I thought they did fairly well with the sports filming - I found it hard to believe that neither lead actress had played soccer before making the film. As to one comment about the lead not being likable (nor moral), EVERY teen rebels against their parents in some way. The movie showed the struggle most teens face growing up trying to please their parents and friends while discovering who they are; with the bonus of giving us a little insight into a different culture.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is an enjoyable film about a young English girl from a Sikh family who wants to play football professionally one day. Her parents are sure her athleticism will scare away prospective suitors so they prevent her from playing with a local team that's trying to recruit her. Eventually, the father recognizes she must pursue her dreams so relents and lets her play.Parminder Nagra plays Jess, the young footballer. Don't feel guilty if you were knocked out by her beauty as much as I was - she was in her mid-twenties when this film was made. The cast was adequate as far as acting skills are concerned. This wasn't meant to be an art film, just simple entertainment. The plot is pretty basic and it's handled well by the cast and director. And you get a little insight into Sikh culture as you follow the story of Jess and her family.A feel good movie and one just about everyone should like.</fullReview>

Parminder Nagra is a wonderful, expressive actress and her work here, showing a sense of familial duty while craving independence, is well done. Beautiful and expressive. Can't wait to see her in other projects.The surprise for me was Jonathan Rhys-Meyers. I'd never seen him before. I'd never known he even existed, but by the end of it all, I was an instant fan. Since, I have seen everything I can get my hands on (Velvet Goldmine is amazing, The Governess is thought provoking, Titus is a scary, scary journey into a Shakespeare that I hadn't known existed etc. The man is beautiful and brilliant).The remaining supporting cast was also fantastic. The families were well-rounded and fun to watch. The airport scene.....LONG IN COMING. I was screaming for that "action" the entire bloody film. And my fav was the final scene. The cricket match. A perfect (maybe too perfect, though I am not complaining) tie up of all the things we would have been left worrying about.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>excellent culture clash movie, but more there</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to admit, I originally did not have much of a choice to see this movie. I first saw it on an airplane flight from London to New York. But because 1) I was enchanted with this movie, and 2) the other selections were awful, I ended up watching it three times on the plane.I'd heard good things about it in Britain, but had not seen any publicity in the States for it. I was attracted to it because of my interest in seeing how different cultures interact when they meet. The Bhamra family in "Bend It" is a perfect example of this phenomenon. I've no idea what it would be like to experience culture shock, having lived my whole life in the U.S., but I imagine it is very difficult for the children of immigrants to walk the tightrope between respecting the culture of their parents and their native land, while not being able to help participating in the culture of the country in which they live, to which they are exposed constantly.Like I said, this is what originally attracted me to this movie, and it succeeded wonderfully at illustrating the clash between East and West, poking fun at some of the peculiarities of each, but never blatantly mocking either one. However, the other part of the story is what makes "Bend It" a winner. This part has to do with striving to achieve one's dreams, despite what others may have planned for you.Jess's parents want her to concentrate on university and finding a suitable (Indian) husband with whom to settle down, as her older sister Pinky is about to do. Jess's whole world, on the other hand, is football (or soccer to my fellow Americans). She knows she is very good, and through her English friend Jules, she hears of opportunities to pursue her football dreams, first as part of an all-girls squad in London, and later of university scholarships and professional teams in America, despite the cultural objections of her parents.While the romance/love triangle subplot did little to interest me, it was important, as it provides a vehicle for Jules's mother to act on her suspicions that her daughter is a lesbian, making for some hilarious comic relief near the end of the movie.Parminder Nagra scored big in her feature film debut as Jess (she can now be seen on "ER" on American television), while Keira Knightley (better known from "Star Wars: The Phantom Menace" and "Pirates of the Caribbean") was fantastic as Jules. The chemistry between them was evident, like they were teammates on a real football team, but that's what good actors and actresses are supposed to do. Anupam Kher, a veteran of over 270 Bollywood films, does well in his minor role as Jess's father. "Bend It" was his English-language debut. Shaheen Khan was shrilly diabolical at times, but overall very good, as Jess's uptight mother. Archie Panjabi was excellent as the shopaholic Pinky. Juliet Stevenson was an absolute riot as Jules's harried and confused mother, and Frank Harper was solid as Jules's entirely supportive father. Jonathan Rhys Meyers turned in a quality performance as the coach of the all-girls football team, and the object of Jess's and Jules's affection. I was impressed with the depth with which his charcter was explored, much more than I thought it would be.Overall a very different and enjoyable movie that most people (especially in soccer-hating America) would be better for seeing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I will never understand Soccer. It's probably cause I was born and raised in America. It may also have to do with my proclivity to be bad at sports. But I will give anything a try once. So when the US women's soccer team was in the world cup (I guess that's what it's called) I watched the whole thing and was bored to tears.You see I can understand why people want to play the sport. There is definitely a lot of skill involved. But after three hours of watching chicks run up and down a field, nobody scoring a goal, I was ****ed. When the US team finally won with a kick-off I felt even more cheated. All that skill only to win the game thru dumb luck. Ehhh, I could take it or leave it.All that to say, I still liked BEND IT LIKE BECKHAM, a schnazzy import from Great Britian.BECKHAM is the story of Jess (Parminder K. Nagra, King Girl) a beautiful young Indian girl living in or around London. She has aspirations of being a great soccer player, but her Mother (Anupam Kher, Jaal:The Trap) wants her to settle down and marry. When Jess meets Juliette (Keira Knightly, The Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl) a young lady who offers her a chance to play with a real soccer team, Jess's life is torn between the culture of her family and the love of the game. Which one wins out? You'll have to watch the film and see.What's nice about a film like this is it gives a glimpse of a London we rarely see in the movies. There is a huge Indian population in the city and it such a fascinating culture. BECKHAM excels in giving us a glimpse into the tradition, and pageantry of this ancient culture without making things too over the top. I'm sure if you look at any culture, or walk of life you will find regular people who do some pretty funny things and BECKHAM showcases the Indian culture with such love and affection, but also with that touch of sweet quirkiness.It also shows us how tradition and religion still survive in our modern world. How cultures that were once separated by miles now live in the house next door. There is a great shot in the film of Jess's family having a celebration. It's loud and boisterous and over the next hedge there's a regular British lady hanging up laundry. It's the kind of shot the say a lot without saying a word.Parminder K. Nagra is phenomenal as Jess. I love how the script is constantly forcing her to up the ante. Pushing her character to grow up. I like how it's full of awkward moments, silly moments, tragic moments, and in the end it's so real. A lesser film would have made this movie about winning the big game. BECKHAM'S stakes are much higher. Do you follow your dreams, or follow your family? Can you do both? While the movie ties these concepts up quite nicely, it only because of Nagra's sweet and yet strong performance that the movie takes on a life of it's own and defies any contrivances.My only qualm with the movie is a pointless and ineffective outing of a minor character. It serves no purpose in the film and in the end stops the film cold. It seemed so unnecessary. It didn't enhance the character any more. It seemed tacked on because in films like these it is necessary to have the token gay guy. But hey it's such a minor flaw that I will stop harping on it.Director Gurinder Chadha has crafted a really sweet, good-natured film. I really liked it a lot and I hate soccer.Hey if I liked BEND IT LIKE BECKHAM I think most people will really like it as well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A movie that deserves an "ola" of raving reviews</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jes. is a young British girl coming from an Orthodox Sikh family. She loves playing the soccer and David Beckham which is unacceptable in her fiercely traditionalist family's eyes. How can we live freely our secular passions in a 21th - century Western society when we are crushed by the burden of an ancestral cultural Asian inheritance and when love is just the parents ' business? Director Gurindhar Chadha approaches all these social problematic topics with the accuracy of a surgery doctor certainly due to a potential autobiographical "vécu" but at the same time with a touch of light humor made of hilarious mix - ups. Ethnical barriers being put aside , the movie focuses on shattering down all kinds of prejudice such like all soccer female players are ipso facto lesbian but always by using the tool of "comique de situation". Here is Indian cinema we love : moving , right and authentic whatever it is made by Native Eastern Indians like "Salaam Bombay" (Golden Camera of 1988 Cannes festival) by Mira Neir or by Second - Generation Britons stemming from immigration. Ms Chadha exactly knows how to show all the compromising difficulties and unfair misfortunes resulting from the inferior status of Indian woman trapped into the cage of traditions whereas she does not drag her characters down to the hellish downwhill of unescapable Loachian social miserabilism. We are through with phoney love stories made in Bollywood where a 6 - armed Civa along with an 8 -legged Vishnu gig like maniacs on rocking choreographies of JLo or Michael Jackson 's MTV video clips and celebrate the wedding of Untouchable Cinderella and Maharadjah aka the local Brad Pitt. Thanks Ms Chandha for overcoming the Karma of corny Bollywoodian items and for giving us a pukka social fairytale.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay - so it can be a little predictable - but compared to the poor excuse for films that are out there, this is clearly a stand-out in the crowd! Really fun - somewhat well acted - nice story - feel good movie....The themes of live your life for yourself and not according to what others want, seek happiness and you will find it, and hang on to friendships despite the inevitable obstacles that arise - are all part of the mix. As well as showing prejudices and how ridiculous they are and how wonderful things can be when those prejudices are torn down... We are all on this planet together - Can't we all just get along?!?! According to Bend It Like Beckham, we can! And by doing so, we all succeed and learn.......Great little film - 9 out of 10 (more for the good vibes, sweet story, and smile I had when I left the theater!)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the age of wonderful little movies such as "My Big Fat Greek Wedding" and "28 Days", "Bend it Like Beckam" has begun to make waves where once was ripples. After seeing this film laughing all through the credits and enjoying every moment of it I am left in great awe and thankful for it's world wide release. After missing the boat earlier this spring to see "Bend it Like Beckam" in selected venues I ran to see it at my local theatre and kicked my self senseless that I had waited this long. There weren't too many plots or ill advised story lines going no-where; There was however a great story being told about two families with talented girls who exceeded at an under appreciated sport by many Americans today. The Soccer footage was unreal keeping the audience right in the game. The family had their issues but were also sweet and endearing like many families. "Bend it Like Beckam" is a must see for anyone looking to spend a few bucks on a great time at the movies. I'm going to see this film again it's a moment that can't be cloned on vhs or dvd. Go out and see this film and experience for yourself this years sleeper and sure fire winner.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Greetings again from the darkness. Have been telling myself for months to go see what all the hype on this film is about. Now I get it. It is a combination coming of age, clash of cultures, love story, strength of family and friends and "Hoosiers" and "Big Fat Greek Wedding". VERY charming film with some nice writing and acting. Keira Knightley (very different from her role in "Pirates of the Carribbean") is wonderful as Jules who befriends an Indian football talent and introduces her to the real game. Jules mother is played brilliantly by Juliet Stevenson and nothing is funnier than her discussion in the car about her daughter possibly being a lesbian (Not that there's anything wrong with it). Jonathan Rhys-Meyers does a bit too much posturing for the camera as the coach, but I do see potential stardom there. Not as hilarious as "My Big Fat Greek Wedding" but every bit as charming, this is a must see even for those who do not appreciate the european style of 'football'.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had just about given up on movies, which I have dearly loved to watch for as long as I can remember. I was on an airplane the other day, BILB was the choice and I pondered spending the $5 on earphones. I hate soccer (sorry everyone else!) and wasn't interested, but some loud children around me convinced me to open up my wallet. Wow. A good story. An unpretentious director. A movie that I could just sit and enjoy and not be distracted by the shots to make the actress look her best or the inside-joke-glib lines they throw in. I, too, instantly compared it to My Big Fat Greek.. but this one came off even better. Greek left me a little empty (maybe it was all the hype). But BILB renewed my joy of movies. The acting wasn't terrific, the editing was a little abrupt (maybe the airline version, who knows). In other words, it wasn't a perfect Hollywood movie, thank God.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Despite the overflow of comparisons, I didn't find this movie to be anything like last year's hit, My Big Fat Greek Wedding. Although MBFGW was unique in it's own way, this British import is a hidden gem, even if you don't know the least bit about soccer or Great Britian's leagues. I'm still a little bummed out about the commercial release of the film this Friday, since I've seen it twice in independent theatres since its original release in March. But I understand that this movie is destined to go far, and the commercial release will help it to do that. In all this, I can't help but smile wide everytime I see another t.v spot for the film because it is just that great. The chances of me seeing a third time before it is released on DVD in the States are pretty high. Not to mention the fact that it is one of the best movies I've seen all year. So, if you have any inkling toward the idea of seeing a heartwarming film about overcoming incredible odds to achieve that ultimate "goal", check it out. Bill me if you don't like it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Ethnic Heart-Warmer</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bend It Like Beckham plows the same ground as My Big Fat Greek Wedding, and hits the same paydirt; a wonderfully entertaining and successful family movie. "Bend It" is set in London, instead of Chicago, and the immigrants are Indian Sikhs, not Greeks. But we find the same story elements; tensions between traditional and modern values, children's expressions of freedom vs. parental control, young love transcending ethnicity.Making a family film is a risky endeavor, it being easy to slip over the edge to saccharin, maudlin storytelling. But like its predecessor "Bend It" navigates these difficult waters well, and keeps on its course. It"s certainly a worthwhile edition to the family video collection.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This film is more than just "cute"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's a lot of talk about Bend it like Beckham being a cute feelgood movie. And it is - it's a warm comedy, with a predictable feelgood ending. But there is more to it than that! It uses the predictability of the plot to make clever points about prejudice, and about how having an open mind really can make your life richer. But most importantly, Bend it like Beckham has a female perspective rarely seen in hit movies. It shows young women as strong, active, bloody minded, funny and clever. If I had a teenage daughter I'd drag her along to the cinema to watch this. Mind you, I'd make my son see it too. In short, I found this film refreshingly modern, with a feminist bite behind all the "cute" stuff. On top of that Keira Knightley makes a great performance, and the normally flamboyant Jonathan Rhys Meyers plays the fanciable coach with subtle perfection. Top stuff.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I loved this movie much for the same reasons I loved 'My Big Fat Greek Wedding'. Sure, they are more or less similar in terms of dealing with cultural and traditions issues but this is the best way to remind people that different cultures still exist and though some of them still practise age old traditions, as corny, stupid and stiffling as they are, it's what makes the world go round. Ironically, age old traditions are still upheld by many, even in a country like Britain as shown in this movie, which you'd assume doesn't have any conservative old fashioned practices. All the cast members did a fine job, especially the two different mothers. One freaks out when she finds her daughter playing around with a boy whilst the other encourages the daughter to have a BF. All's well that ends well but be reminded that for every happy ending, there are at least 1000 other sad endings.Kudos to Paminder - she gave up an arranged marriage to do this movie!</fullReview>

Then, when I did, I was worried that as an average American guy with little to no interest in soccer, I would miss out on a lot of the humor. I was pleasantly surprised by a quite good, well acted, and very funny movie. The plot is a bit simplistic, a not entirely unique story of a teen following her dreams despite her parents' wishes to the contrary. What makes this film great, though, is the characters and the way they interact. They were hilarious! I found myself laughing out loud several times during the movie, and left with a smile on my face.

		<fullReview>I enjoyed this movie a great deal. The two main characters are two likable girls that have a passion for something. The movie is loaded with feminist messages and racial discrimination, and that is the fuel for the conflict in the story. Girls are looked at with skepticism when it comes to sports and have a tough time proving themselves. This is true with Jess. She is extremely talented, but still gets clowned at when she plays at the park by a group of idiotic boys. She doesn't truly realize her talent until she is evaluated by Jules and her coach. The movie touched on issues of discrimination when talking about Jess' father. When he was younger, he yearned to be a cricket player, but got spat on by the English boys. The performances were all great. Everybody played their part right on target. I see many good things in the future for the two lead actresses. The chemistry between the two girls and their love triangle with their coach seems real and un-forced. Jess as the hero of the story embodies so many virtues. She is obedient to her family while at the same time showing so much resolve and courage. Although she lies to her parents and sneaks out, her intentions are out of passion; not of greed or mal-intent. I highly recommend this movie. It has comedy, drama, and some decent sports action. It's the "feel-good" movie of the year.</fullReview>

The only beef I have with this film is the resolution of conflict between Jesse and Keira Knightley's character. It seems as if the beef between them was real. Near the end, the two are just peachy together. In fact, the conflict resolution is marred by Keira Knightley's character's mother and her wrong assumption of her daughter's sexual preference. Perhaps this was an oversight on the director's part or the story was not fleshed out to great detail as it should have been. Other than that, this movie leaves one feeling uplifted.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a women's sports film, which is not very common at this point, Bend It Like Beckham is a far advanced mutant. It deals with a lot of materials--immigrant issue, interracial romance, generation conflict, and gay/lesbian issue--and interweaves them into one compelling story. Soccer scenes look real thanks to skillful cinematography and editing. The counterpoint of an Indian traditional marriage ceremony and a soccer game is one of the most impressive climaxes on celluloid ever seen. Acting could be better as well as the characters' emotional struggles could be explored deeper. Still, the film is unique and well-done enough to be a landmark in film history.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A very well-made, though perhaps predictable story about a girl of Indian descent, living in London, trying to deal with her very traditional Indian parents and her obvious talent and love of football (aka in the US as soccer). Some have likened this to "My Big Fat Indian Wedding". There are perhaps many similarities, though I found "My Big Fat Greek Wedding" unwatchable. The characters are very likable and one wants them to succeed. No harsh, contrived conflicts; just decent people trying to work through things. The setting was interesting in that you really get a feel of what suburban London family life is like. The actress in the lead role of Jess is exotic and stunningly beautiful. Very good film; you won't be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** What many people fail to realize is that this movie has already been playing around the world for the last 12 months, and has only now begun to get a foothold in the US. If you look at this weekend's gross, it is 17+mil which clearly shows that this weekend was a big 'word of mouth' campaign success for Bend it like Beckham'.This is a fabulous movie about Indian culture(sikh faith in this case), their traditions, values and how one girl's dreams come above everything else in the end. I hate to admit it, but I still tear up at the part where Jess's Dad agrees to let her go to America and play football. Brilliant film, and I will add, a revolutionary one. People may not see this now, but what Gurinder Chadha has done with this film will be remembered by many successful women atheletes for years to come.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Awesome Movie...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jesminder(Parminder K. Nagra)loves playing football more then anything and her biggest idol is David Beckham. But playing football won't be that easy for Jesminder since her strict parents don't think it's a good idea and are totally against it. But along with her best friend and football buddy Juliette(Keira Knightley) Jasminder will stop at nothing in her way of achieving her dreams and becoming a professional football player. This was an awesome movie, it was just so entertaining and everything about it is just perfect. It's bright,funny and intelligent and it will please everybody in the family. The acting was great and the soundtrack was very nice too. This movie was very enjoyable and made me feel wonderful at the end. I would give Bend It Like Beckham 10/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wasnt sure what my expectations of Bend It Like Beckham were.I knew this was about an asian girl who was a good footballer but had to struggle against the wishes of her strict parents.Not exactly high on my agenda of movies as much as i love football but what a pleasant suprise i got. I would go as far as to say this is one of the best british movies of recent times. This has everything a good film should have...good acting,great script, superb direction and most importantly of all it gives you that feeling of "wow what a good film". I big mention must go to Perninda Nagra the you Indian actress who has the lead role. She looks very assured and grabs the attention of the viewer and is not a bad footballer either.There are a couple of poor aspect about the film ,one the football scenes are not the best ( epecially the free kick of which the goalie dived right across the ball) and also the captain of the team played by Shaznay Lewis could neither act or play football and looked competely out of place in the film. Dont let that put you off what is a brilliant little film. 9 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My wife and I loved "Bend It Like Beckham" and consider it one of the best movies of all time! We had such a good time...like we did when we saw "My Big Fat Greek Wedding," but that happy film didn't make me almost break down (literally) in tears of joy like "Beckham" did! Most reviewers agree with my assessment. The few that haven't? Well, when they saw it, were they not feeling well? Were they distracted by worry or pain...or drink? Ha! Do they not have a warm heart? Did they even really see the movie? I can't believe it!I really miss "Bend It Like Beckham," and I have to go see it again soon. I also know what I'm getting everybody I know for Christmas, but I better ask them if they already own the DVD/video--By December, they all probably will! And for the first time in my life--I'm a soccer fan! And you don't have to be a soccer fan to love this movie. The love, warmth and humor, plus the attractiveness of all the characters make it all worthwhile. Don't miss it! Experience the joy!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>compared to Greek Wedding...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think it would be hard to see this movie and not compare it with My Big Fat Greek Wedding (assuming you've seen it). I don't think this one is a knock-off, it stands quite well on its own. Furthermore, there are some key elements that give it more appeal to the younger crowd. There are some typical, but fun twists, cute misunderstandings that you'd expect in any comedy, and it has a Brittish setting which automatically makes it feel more arty. It's one of those movies that feels formulaic, but you don't care, you just go with it. I don't really care too much for sports, but it was a fine way to explore some of the themes of the film - which were mostly to do with contrasts in culture, generation, and gender. I enjoyed the movie, but not enough to want to see it again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While films like the Matrix and Bruce Almighty compete for the box office records, here is a film that is true genuine fun. Smartly written with terrific perfomances from the cast including the three main leads: Parminder K. Nagra, a lovely and hopefully the first Indian actress to become a lead actress. Keira Knightly, a star overnight and on her way for more stardom. And last, but never least: my favorite young actor, Jonathan Rhys-Meyers, who is absolutely the most stunning creature I have ever seen on the screen. He is on his way to joining other young English actors like Ewan MacGregor, Jude Law, and Orlando Bloom. I hope this film receives recognition at next year's Academy Awards for best original screenplay. This was a true film with a heart and a lot of kick!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best sports movies ever!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Bend It Like Beckham" is one of the best sports movies I've ever seen. The reason is because it focuses on a sport that has rarely been covered in film (women's soccer) and it does so in a way that is warm, affecting, and real. I have confirmation of this from a reliable source - my girlfriend was a star soccer player in high school and college. She said that all of the details in the film were completely spot-on - the feelings toward the male coach, the bonding and jealousy that the girls alternately feel toward one another, and the female emotions that play themselves out on the field. She even said that one of her teammates had to attend a wedding the day of a game, similar to Jess! Also, just like the coach in the film, my girlfriend's soccer career ended with a knee injury. Obviously, the film is a must-see for female athletes past, present, or future. But it isn't necessary to be a sports fan to appreciate it. What makes the film special is that we can all relate to a story of someone who is striving for their own independence and identity. </fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although I saw this movie last year over here in the UK upon release, I'm pleasantly suprised to see the American auidence also, on the whole enjoyed it. Perhaps its the usual British expectations, but I did not think it would travel across the pond very well. My mistake.Bend it like Beckham is a nice, amusing feelgood movie for all ages. Ok, so its one big sporting cliche, but how else can you do this sort of film? The dialogue is funny, the characters wonderful and the soundtrack is perfect. In Parminder Nagra the producer/director cast to perfection, even though the actress was a unknown even here in the UK. Her sympathetic and understated approach to Jess really did endear this viewer to her onscreen dilemma. This from somebody who normally gives this type of film a wide berth. Excellent supporting cast, especially from both the girls neurotic mothers and their long suffering husbands!One of my two favourite films of 2002, go see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The flower of this film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What keeps this film in mind long after viewing? What made it the first film I've seen in decades that made me wish it would never end?First, I think it is the absence of evil; the most destructive bit is the history of Joe's ruining his football career by playing injured and wanting to prove strength to his father; but even this, like every complication in the plot, derives from people wishing for good. The flower of the film is Jess' silent weeping, cleaning her boots, when it appears she won't be able to reach her dream. There's nothing vindictive or unfeeling in her confinement by her sister's wedding except her solitude with her love for football. The power of the denouement is not simply permission to go to Santa Clara, but the first recognition by a member of her family, her father, of the intensity of her love for the game.We admire Jesminda for stubbornly bending the rules, but she hits an insurmountable wall; only her father's recognition in her of his own thwarted love as a fastballer, his astonishment at her "brilliance," breaks her from the wedding and from the solicitor/medical career as gray as the bathrobe in which she trudged upstairs to her room with news of being accepted to university.The affective quality of the flower is consistent, as far as I can tell, throughout this film and its making: Chadha's laughing about her own mother's bossiness as an extra on the set is the same guiding principle of the plot and the characters, and permeates every scene and sound of the film.I'll probably go see it again.</fullReview>

But, I also can't see what any one else can like about this movie. The plot was extremely predictable, and for a comedy there really weren't that many laughs.I had a smile on my face the entire time because I could relate to the setting and the characters (and understanding Punjabi helps a bit as well).

		<fullReview>Praised as the best British comedy since Bridget Jones' Diary, Bend it Like Beckham never reaches that goal. The main character does not succeed in engaging the viewer and one gets only one or two forced chuckles from the so-called humour. (minor spoilers ahead) It was quite obvious from the very beginning how the movie would end, but actually it succeeds at being even more disgustingly sweet than one feared. One of those 'everyone must get a happy ending' cases. I give it **/***** only for the better than average acting and directing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I guess my reaction to the flick is from the promotional hype. The film was made out to be some great award winning epic. It was a cute narrative that put music video montages ahead of character development. There was a few chucklesand a warm fuzzy feeling towards the end. The film could have functioned at a deeper level, but issues brought up were tossed in so carelessly, with nodevelopment (She called my a Paki, you know what that means. Yes I'm Irish),that rather than developing the characters, it reveled them as to be 2dimensional- caricatures.If this was Gurinder Chadha's first effort I would applaud it as a freshman's film, but since she has a few under the belt, I feel someone else should be given a chance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Charming, funny and uplifting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(May contain minor Spoilers)I found this film to be a wonderful alternative to the summer dreg American movie goers are normally bombarded with. The story itself is simple enough: a young English woman, born to Indian parents, dreams of being a football player much like her idol, David Beckham. Unfortunately, her parents would rather she take a more traditional route with her life by getting her university degree and marrying a nice Indian boy. It is this struggle between Jesminder's desire to carve out her own happiness and identity as an athlete, and her parents wish to maintain their culture and values, that make up the movie's core. Jesminder (played by the wonderful Padminder Nagra)is helped along the way by another aspiring footballer Juliette (Keira Knightly) and by Joe (Jonathan Rhys-Meyers, a terrific performance) a former player, who coaches Jess and Juliette's all female team. As other reviewers have noted, there is never any doubt as to the outcome of the story, but that knowledge never detracts from the sheer pleasure of getting to know these lovely characters.The acting overall was superb. I would be very surprised if Ms. Nagra doesn't become a huge star. She lights up the screen with her sensitive performance and gorgeous face. Jonathan Rhys-Meyers is wonderful as Jesminder's romantic interest and football mentor, and what a refreshing change of pace to see a love story between two young adults based on mutual respect and real affection. On a shallow note, Jonathan and Padminder make for one of the most stunningly beautiful on-screen couples I've seen in a very long time. The supporting cast is equally talented, I especially loved Jesminder's parents played by Anupam Kher and Shaheen Khan, and her sister Pinky, played by Archie Panjabi. The talented and very funny Juliet Stevenson is a scene stealer as Juliette's slightly overbearing and concerned mother.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was happy that this movie came to the cineplex in our little corner of the world...it's rare that indie films come here, and since I missed this one at Sundance, I was anxious to see it. This time of year I generally don't see many movies because this is that time that the tweens and teens are "king" in the movie makers eyes...most movies due to be released in the next 2 or 3 months are blockbuster shoot-em-up special effects (yaaaaaaaaaaaawnnn..) type films that do absolutely nothing for me. Yeah, I have seen this story before, but you know what? The filmmakers made it interesting, and I was intrigued during the entire movie. I thought the actors did a great job, especially Juliet Stevens. I am sure she had a ball chewing all that scenery...she made me laugh. This was a sweet little film, and while the main character does defy her parents in order to play *football* she eventually does the right thing by them while still being true to herself. I read some user comments that say this movie was formulaic, and perhaps it was to a certain extent. However, I didn't find it THAT predictable. I highly recommend this film to those who are tired of all the action films...and it's NOT a chick flick, in my opinion.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An amazing movie. Marketing and critical hype is a bit misleading, however, at least for me. I had been perceiving it as a kind of "foreign" movie, albeit entertaining and charming and likeable, along the lines of "Monsoon Wedding," etc. Wow! Was that perception ever wrong! It is a masterfully executed movie, absolutely perched at the top of the entire heap of mainstream American and English movies. It is pure joy, superbly acted and put together. The Indian elements blend right in with modern life so smoothly that you will never think you are watching something instructional, or somehow educational, politically correct, or otherwise a school and art house version of something that is hideously dull but somehow "good for you." No, no, no! It is ALL bright and genuine, heart-warming, and exciting entertainment.And yet, the cultures depicted will be so fascinating and real and rich, that you will be on the edge of your seat as you enjoy each and every moment. For me, an American, the English motif was also revelatory and new. And the soccer world--- was also new and intriguing to finally see it up close. I still don't understand soccer, but I enjoyed its presence here. And the world of girls' sports teams was also depicted wonderfully--- this aspect will be somewhat new for many people, including females. All of it was amazing!So, don't be scared of the foreigness--- it really isn't an issue. The movie is done so well, and the humanity and inspiration is so full, and so natural that you may actually leave the theater thinking you already know a bunch of British folks, white and Indian! (Although if you're an American, you may not want to actually watch any more soccer, but that's OK).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really liked this movie. I had a bad day and it cheered me up. Sure, it had the typical elements of a coming of age movie, and the general premise wasn't very original, but I don't care. The story was well told and it had me laughing and feeling better when I left the theater.A big plus is the cast. Great actress who plays the lead. Terrific chemistry between her and the coach. Everyone was very likeable and believable.The main characters are people I would like to know, and basically every character was treated respectfully. Lots of misunderstandings, but nothing too unreasonable. Only one issue caused me to cringe a little bit in embarassment, and that was the WUSA soccer thing (I really hope in a couple of years it'll get more popular here), but overall I had a great time laughing with the audience.One more thing, and this may be a spoiler (look below):Okay, I admit it. I'm a sentimental romantic. Therefore, I believe that every romantic/coming of age movie should have a kiss in it. Not just a matter of fact kiss, but a really romantic and satisfying (but sweet) kiss. Well, this one has a decent kiss in it. If she had walked away without a kiss that would have been real disappointing. For example, I wish the second "Anne of Green Gables" miniseries had a kiss like the one in this film. Frankly, that miserable kiss between Anne and Gilbert ruined the whole second show for me. What a letdown!Not so here! Accordingly, this movie gets a high grade by me for having a decent kiss at the end!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bend It Like Beckham: 7/10</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although it most definitely will be compared to My Big Fat Greek Wedding, it really shouldn't be. Even though both of them have a young person rebelling against their orthodox parents, Greek Wedding is a nice little slapstick romantic comedy blockbuster. Bend It Like Beckham isn't as much slapstick, but better in most every way, except it isn't as funny, and it's looking to be the next indie-blockbuster, which it shouldn't.Jesminder `Jess' Bhamara (Parminder Nagra, in a very good debut) lives with her mother (Shaheen Khan), father (Anupam Kher, star of over 100 Bollywood movies), and sister Pinky (Archie Panjabi) in England. She's a good football player (that's also called soccer), and she often plays with boys in the park, and she always beats them. One day, Juliet `Jules' Paxton (Keira Knightley) approaches her and asks her to play for the only women's team in England.She has to avoid her parents, because they don't want her to play sports, they want her to do housework, then marry a man and live a normal Indian life. Jess sneaks out of her house and pretends to be going to work. Meanwhile, Pinky is getting married. Much to Jess's dismay, her parents find out and Pinky's marriage is called off, because Jess is a disgrace to her family. Also, Jess loves famous British football star David Beckham, and has a crush on her coach, Joe (Jonathan Rhys-Meyers).Bend It Like Beckham is a fulfilling and `winning comedy', as one tagline says. It had depth in the characters (unlike Greek Wedding, which just throws characters in). We got to care about them, and wanted to learn more about them. At many times I laughed, but it seemed to have too many serious and slow points without comedy in it. Although it had a more serous side than Greek Wedding, it didn't have to go that far.The cinematography at times was very good. It was spinning many times and was on a crane many times. One especially cool shot was during a match, when it was a first person view from a football. The music was very good, also. Something else that was good was the acting. Nagra gives a great debut, and she should be in more movies as the years go by. Knightley, who looked very sexy throughout the movie, did a performance that I didn't know was possible in movies like this. Kher and Khan were very funny, and I believed everyone for what they were in the movie. I would recommend Bend It Like Beckham if you like comedies that are both funny and poignant.My rating: 7/10Rated PG-13 for language and sexual content.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another culture conflict movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If there is any movie Bend It Like Beckham resembles, it is Real Women Have Curves, a small independent American movie that came out last year. From the sneaking around, to the supportive father, to the home visit by the mentor--it is cut from the same blueprint. I felt like I was watching a remake of the almost the same movie. It is much more similar to Real Women Have Curves than it is to My Big Fat Greek Wedding, for example. In Wedding, the outsider joins the Greek ethnic group. In Beckham and Real Women, the girls defy their parents to pursue their dreams. The movies both star 18-year-old ethnic minority women in the summer between high school and college who are trying to figure out what they are going to do next year, while their respective talents go unappreciated and discouraged by their colorful but somewhat repressive families. Through the support of strong male mentors the girls realize that their dreams lie beyond the confines of their insular families. In both cases the mothers insist that the girls live by traditional values, learn to cook and keep house, and live their adulthoods the way they did. This means getting married, having children, cooking, keeping house, and taking a traditional job, either in a factory in one case or as a doctor in the other. The similarities between these 2 movies are uncanny and startling, and I am surprised that not more people have pointed them out. Perhaps because Real Women was a limited release with no name actors, it didn't get the attention it deserved.That said, I liked Beckham. It was a real feel-good movie, if predictable. You KNEW she would get recruited to a US college and possibly to the pros. Just how she would pull it off with the big game the same day has her sister's wedding was tougher to predict. I highly recommend this movie. It is a great girl-power film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A British movie with kick!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The latest in a growing pool of movies focusing on culture clashes in Great Britain, "Bend it Like Beckham" combines a number of familiar conventions with plenty of innovative touches. One constant theme -- airplanes soaring ahead from Heathrow Airport -- reflects the characters' desire to surmount the repressions of their suburban environment and fulfill their dreams. This is decidedly un-British, and all the better for it!The leading ladies are both excellent -- the girl who plays Jess is an especially sensitive actress, and Jules (Keira Knightley) will be lighting up our screens for many years to come. You heard it here first.The director is painstakingly indulgent toward the Asian society from which Jess is inexorably seeking to escape. Indian homes are seen as vibrant, colorful, an endless source of delicious food, and a protective cocoon for ordinary women with no career ambitions, like Jess's sister. But our sympathies never leave the ambitious and individualist Jess, not for an instant.There are a few strange editorial segues, but by and large, this movie marks a step forward for British film; gritty kitchen-sink dramas are all very well, but the snap, crackle and pop of "Bend it Like Beckham" is a vast improvement, and leaves much hope for the future, as do the movie's young actresses. Bravo!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a genuinely feel-good movie (that didn't send me into sugar shock)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>BILB is fluffy fun, not a serious movie, but it's very entertaining. Although it pokes fun at traditional Sikh attitudes towards women (learn to cook, get married, have babies), it does so very affectionately. Pretty much every character in the movie is presented sympathetically, even when they're wrong. It would've been easy for Mr and Mrs Bhamra to have been repressive stereotypes, but their love for Jess is communicated even as they try to stop her playing footie. Jess's sister Pinky is at first presented as a vapid cow, but as the movie goes on, gets a lot more depth. And the film makes clear Jess's decision to defy her parents and stay on the team doesn't just affect her. Pinky's future in-laws try to call off the wedding because they don't want a 'scandalous' girl like Jess in the family, which shows just how many rules Jess's little rebellion is breaking.Jess loves footie, but isn't a kneejerk rebel who wants to break away from all her traditions, at one point she walks away from another rebellion because she feels she's putting her family through enough by standing firm on football, and doesn't want to hurt them with anything else. There's nice parallelism between Jess's traditional Sikh family and her best friend's white family. Juliet Stevenson steals every scene she's in with a gloriously over-the-top performance as Jules's lingerie-saleswoman mother, who just like Jess's traditional Indian mother, can't understand how she raised such a tomboy. Even more fun comes from both Jules's parents' mistaken belief that Jules is a lesbian, and their valiant attempts to accept her anyway.Jonathan Rhys Meyers does a good job as Joe, the good-looking young coach whom both Jules and Jess lust after. As with 'Bring It On', the last movie I saw about female athletes, the male love interest has a smallish role, and is subordinated to the buddy relationship between the two female leads, but unlike in Bring It On, the male love interest is actually a reasonably interesting character in his own right. The love story is a small part of the film, but doesn't feel tacked on. The tentativeness of the Jess/Joe relationship actually feels appropriate to Jess's emotional journey throughout the movie, and there's some nice chemistry between Parminder Nagra as Jess and Rhys-Meyers. Speaking of males, Jess's relationship with her (platonic) friend Tony is also nicely handled, as are his problems with his own traditional Sikh family.There are some weaknesses to the mvoie: the only other team member to get any character development is Jules (Keira Knightley), the rest are interchangeable. Sometimes it feels like the director is trying to cram too many themes and plotlines into the movie, and there's too much reliance on people accidentally catching Jess in a compromising position (it happens four times).As for other user comments which have said the setting is unrealistic, I've been to Hounslow several times and a) there's a large Anglo-Indian minority, b) there's nothing unusual about the Bhamras living in semi-detached middle-class prosperity.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ok, I saw this film under the wrongful impression one gets from the trailer and other publicity.The minute the critics start raving about a film one should suspect something fishy is going on ... and I usually do but most the audience are as unreliable as the afore mentioned.Like the ever dull and not less mentally challenged Owen Gleiberman [Entertainment Weekly] saying " If I had a dime for every time someone asked me how I could have hated 'My big fat greek wedding', I think I'd gather up the money, rent out a theater, and invite all of them to see 'Bend it like Beckham'. "Why? To torture them?If there is something good about this film , it has to be Jonathan Rhys Meyers [the lead male character and love interest to the protagonist] ... he is by no means a talented actor nor reason enough to watch this film but he is very handsome and stupidly charming as such.Anyone who has seen "The magnificent Ambersons" can confirm this.The story is a cliche but none the less it had reasonable potential to be a good light hearted comedy ... a feel good movie.It never had potential to be realistic on any level, serious, or deep ... for these qualities are reserved for truly talented people [directors, actors, writers, etc].Now, if you are a silly person be sure you'll enjoy it ... but if you are that other kind of viewer used to a tad of higher thinking I have no doubt you will be dissapointed.Unfortunately for us the director and writer are very extreme people [they'd do better working in theater] ... they are either extremely serious or extremely silly soap opera like.The film ridicules everyone except who ever is not there, the story is a joke with too much music and not enough content.I don't feel like going into the particulars of the so called story line, it bores me to death but I do hope that whoever watched the film after reading my review [that of a true film buff / filmmaker] suffers and pays well for it ... which they will.Before leaving though, I should say that the "resolution" of the relationship between Jonathan &amp; the she-footballer [soccer player here in the US] was almost good / credible until of course it's ruined by the "real resolution" at the very end of the film which takes place at the airport.You'll know what I'm talking about soon enough.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had heard many reviews about this movie, but it had been in the U.S. for several months before I finally got around to seeing it last night.I was not disappointed, either."Bend It Like Beckham" is one of the best movies to come out of Britain since "The Full Monty".The movie also dealt with many of the culture clashes between middle easterners and the western world, which I thought was a nice touch to the drama. It also dealt with generational issues between parents and their children. The moral of the story is basically, more or less, you have to eventually let your children live their own lives instead of living your life thru them.I have been a long time fan of football (soccer, for the Americans) but for some reason the game has just not caught on "professionally" here in the U.S. I still don't think the U.S. even has a stadium built specifically for football (soccer), although they "considered" making the Atlanta - Fulton County Stadium in Atlanta, Georgia a football (soccer) stadium before they tore it down to turn it into a parking lot for the new Turner Stadium they built next to it shortly after the 1996 Olympics.It just seems like here in the U.S., the majority of the fan fare for football (soccer) is in the movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Kudos for Ms. Chadha. This might be a replay of My Big Fat Greek Wedding but clearly the theme is appealing to us at a time of social fragmentation. We root for Jessie to get her chance to be "herself" in a modern hip liberated world, but we are not only amused but comforted by her parents seriousness about their traditions, and the dangers of leaving them. Some of the scenes are awkward and corny but fortunately the movie doesn't take itself too seriously and there are strange delights that overcome the movie's weaknesses. Jessie (Parminder Kaur Nagra)is exquisite which in itself makes watching the movie pleasurable. She is both a guileless child and a beautiful woman, the kind of Cinderella tension that makes a movie magic. I don't know if the cuts between the Indian dancing and the soccer game are a special talent of Ms. Chadha but I was delirious with the colors and rhythms. It compares to the best of Micheal Mann, or Steven Spielberg. The images and sound sweep you into a kind of frenzy. So once again congratulations to her. If it was luck I hope you luck out again, or keep the same editor. But I suspect there is real talent here that may bring us many more delights.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Who wants to cook ?Aloo Gobi', when you can bend a ball like Beckham?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bend it like Beckham had me fooled before I had the chance to see it. I thought that it would be a sport dominated movie that has no real story outside of that realm. How wrong I was, as I enjoyed not only the wonderful soccer that was shown off in this movie, but the struggles our main star has with her family's Indian culture and what one will do to break with tradition. This is a stylish comedy that should not be passed up.Football mad Jess is 18, smart, beautiful and can bend a ball better than any boy she knows. She has set her heart on playing for a top women's footy team, but there is one problem: her strict parents want her to settle down with a nice Indian boy and learn how to cook. Flying in the face of her parent's disapproval, Jess and her best mate Jules make a name for themselves in the Beautiful game, but then love rears its head for both of them in the form of their fit (in more ways than one) coach Joe. Jess has a tough choice ? her best friend or a gorgeous bloke. What is a girl to do?Although I can understand people saying that this film is ?clichéd and predictable' in parts, I found the story to this film to be refreshing and funny in many aspects. Director/writer Gurinder Chadha wrote what I believe was a most entertaining of stories that holds more than just soccer within it. The struggles that we see Jess go through with her family, and their strict Indian traditions, in addition to the ways that she will do anything and everything to play the sport that she loves. I also like the movies main theme, which states ?Jesse's story is not so much about football, but someone realising their dreams'. We all need to ?realise our dreams' and I believe this movie allows us to do that. Gurinder also placed much of her own life experiences beautifully in the film. Gurinder said that ?B.I.L.B.' was her first autobiographical film she has made. I believe she put a lot of her own characteristics as a kid into the main character of Jess for the movie, saying that she ?broke the rules just like Jess does. Then to place a lot of her own family (including her own Mum) in the film, the way she did, was a subtle, clever and nice touch by Chadha. The main cast of ?B.I.L.B.' was young and innocent. Jess (played by newcomer Parminder Nagra) was a great choice as the budding football talent. The chemistry Jess shares with Jules (Keira Knightsly) is another of the films highlights. Jess is an attractive girl with grand dreams of making it big, while Jules is a tomboy, who is feisty, sexy and darn good at football. Both actresses had to do a large amount of football training to look and be like ?soccer pros' and it is testimony to the dedication the pair put in, to become the characters they were. Other cast members I liked include Joe (Jonathon Rhys Meyers), the new football coach for Jess. It is easy to see that this pair are strongly attracted to each other. However, this causes a major rift between Jess and Jules. I also like the adult members of the cast. Jesse's parents are strict and traditional Indian people and it is no wonder that children rebel against such ideals. Mr. and Mrs. Bharma (Anupan Kher and Shaheen Khan) accurately play out what traditional Indian parents would be like. Add in the funny little role by Jule's mum, Paula (Juliet Stevenson), who is a total embarrassment to her daughter many times in the movie.There are many shots I like in ?B.I.L.B.'. The way the audience get to see London is wonderfully captured in the film's camera work and makes me curious to find out what London would be like to visit. Again this part of the film has Gurinder's own life experiences within it. Then take the sports sequences in the film, which seem so real. They give the film incredible freedom and show off the talents of Jess and Jules well. There is one shot at the final soccer match where Jess is playing which is cleverly thought up and incorporated into the film by Gurinder. Then the chance to see a traditional Indian wedding for me was a real eye-opener. These weddings are quite different to the weddings we have in western society, but look like a fun event to be part of. In closing, ?Bend it like Beckham' is a film I believe anyone, anywhere in the world can enjoy. It has such a warming feeling attached to it and made me feel great after watching it. David Beckham would have to be proud to have his name associated with such a great film, ?cause I know I would. A fitting tribute to this film is the great DVD it has, which actually shows a recipe featurette for the Indian dish, ?Aloo Gobi', a meal I know I want to try and cook one day. With an infectious soundtrack that includes the hit ?hot, hot, hot', I can only praise what a film this really is. Let me leave you with this final thought about Bend it like Beckham ? it was essentially a film ?which shows you to be true to yourself, hold on to your dreams and with a little luck, they might just come true'. This is a good message for us all to have in our lives, whatever we want grow up to be!CMRS gives ?Bend it like Beckham': 4 (Very Good Film)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Scanning through the lists of current movies, we said, "What's this?" We watched the trailer on the Internet and thought it looked promising. It was better than we expected. A few people have already compared this movie to Greek Wedding, and in many ways it is similar. If you liked Greek Wedding (i did) you'll probably like Bend It Like Beckham. This movie is not quite as polished as Greek Wedding, but it acquits it self well enough. Lots of laughs, some moments of deeper introspection make a nice package. If the movie fails anywhere, it's in the romantic interest. The chemistry didn't seem to be there for the two main (male/female) characters. While the male lead was somewhat believeable romantically, the female lead's interest in the romance seemed contrived. They actually could have dropped the romance near the end and the movie might have been more believeable.</fullReview>

The casting is superb -- characters' accents seem just what they ought to be, and actors enrich the story greatly by how well they convey attitudes and whole situations with their interactions and other behaviour. I expect this is a film people can watch at many levels. As someone who prefers not to rewatch films or reread books much, I still expect to enjoy this film a few more times and pick up on subtleties that skipped my conscious awareness the first time through.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fresh take on immigrant assimilation and feminism through sports</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Bend It Like Beckham" is not the first movie to deal with immigrant Asians coping with traditional parents and untraditional Western aspirations, from "Monsoon Wedding," to even smaller films like "American Chai," "ABCD," "The Debut," and "Double Happiness." And it's not the first sports romance to deal with women striving for equal treatment in athletics, viz. "A League of Their Own." But it's the first to combine both genres, and with abundant charm and good will. This is not only a strong statement for continuing Title IX in U.S. sports (petitions in the lobbies would be filled with signatures) and exporting its provisions elsewhere (though someone should have told writer/director Gurinder Chadha that women's soccer is not a big sport in the U.S., either at college or professionally, so the U.S. goal is a bit awkward). But it is also a clear-eyed look at the stresses, strains, and joys of adolescent assimilation, also heard through the musical selections, amidst ethnic diversity and being a curiosity to both prejudiced and well-meaning natives (which is from another genre of movies, such as "Looking for Alibrandi" about Italian-Australians.) While the British slang and "football" references can be hard for Americans to follow, the settings were startlingly identical to my own Queens neighborhoods of attached Tudor houses underneath the flight plan of a major airport amidst a panoply of Asian food markets and natively-dressed shoppers with their rebellious/model minority offspring in tow. Even the crowded public parks filled with a Babel of soccer and cricket players looked just like Queens. And all should be able to relate to the families on the screen, of sibling rivalries and parental expectations (and funny misunderstandings and real tensions on all sides), shown with great love and humor, including amusing teen fantasies. The inter-ethnic romance does teeter toward cliche, but just barely avoids falling into that expectation with the heroine's ambiguous embrace of some aspect of her ethnic heritage (besides playing kitchen hacky sack with vegetables while learning to cook samosa), though the double ending is a bit unnecessary. Be sure to stay for the joyous credits where all the actors demonstrate how much they enjoyed working together.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More a chick flick than a footy film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not a bad movie, but the romantic subplot between J. Rhys-Meyers and the two lead girls came across as forced for the sake of the teen girls in the audience. I daresay no coach in his position would allow himself to kiss one of his players, let alone take himself (and the team) to a nightclub during a tournament. The explanation of 'you can't choose who you fall for' doesn't wash in this circumstance. That said, I definitely enjoyed this movie. If not for the cursing, and overt informercial segments for the WUSA, I'd suggest it to the AYSO crowd.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another slick commercial package</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the warm and appealing comedy, Bend it Like Beckham, traditional Sikh family values clash with the aspirations of a headstrong 18-year old girl, Jess Bhamra (Parminder K. Nagra), who wants to play professional soccer. Her hero is David Beckham, England's top professional soccer player. "Anyone can cook aloo gobi," she complains, "but who can bend a ball like Beckham?" Like Jess, director Gurinda Chadha grew up in London's Southall neighborhood in a Sikh Punjabi family, and the film's concerns about racism, gender discrimination, and cultural identity reflect her own personal experience. Bend it Like Beckham took in more than $25.7 million at box offices in the U.K., the most ever for a British-made and, as a result of the film's success, women all over Britain began signing up in large numbers for amateur soccer teams. The film begins where My Big Fat Greek Wedding left off. Jess' parents want her to follow in the footsteps of her older sister Pinkie (Archie Panjabi) and marry a neighborhood Indian boy Tony (Ameet Chana). Jess, however, wants to eventually play on a professional soccer team and would rather sneak off to the park to practice with a group of neighborhood boys. When a friend Jules, played by Julia Roberts look-alike Keira Knightley, asks her to try out for an all-girl soccer team, her mother (Juliet Stevenson) strongly objects and tells Jess that it is not feminine for a girl to be playing football. Jess' father (Anupam Kher) is more sympathetic, however, but remembers the racism that stopped him from playing cricket and wants to prevent his daughter from experiencing a similar rejection. Jess and Jules become friends but their relationship is complicated when both develop a love interest in Joe, the handsome young coach (Jonathan Rhys-Meyers). Jess is aware that her talents are sufficiently strong to win a scholarship to an American college and must ultimately choose between her ambitions and honoring her parent's desires. Predictably, all the loose ends are neatly resolved.I wanted to like this film because of its message about transcending limitations and because I love soccer. Unfortunately, we never really get a sense of the strategy, thinking, passing, and teamwork that is the heart of the game. All we see are dizzying close-ups of the girls running and scoring goal shots and the constant display of the players' legs, chests, and behinds. Apparently the director would rather pump up the energy with sexual suggestiveness, ear-splitting music, and last minute heroics than help us understand the game. Nagra is outstanding as the conflicted girl and Jonathan Rhys-Myers is impressive as the coach who had his own career cut short by a knee injury, but the love interest has little depth or chemistry. Though the film "celebrates the process of cultural change", it never really grapples with the real pain of discrimination and rejection. Ultimately, while it may leave you with a warm, fuzzy feeling, Bend it Like Beckham is so formulaic that it ends up as just another slick commercial package whose final kick falls far short of the goalpost. </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Making a Formula Work (and PAY!)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Race relations in England are rarely actually funny (they aren't here either). English directors and script writers go to considerable lengths, often, to depict cross-cultural clashes as amusing, frequently light-hearted and almost always resolved in a fair and happy way. Perhaps there is too much rawness with white/black interactions for this approach. Most British comedies that deal with race are centered on the East meeting the West (actually almost exactly the title of a successful such comedy of a few years ago too). "Bend It Like Beckham" is one of those formulaic drama/comedies of cultural meetings and machinations which, surprisingly, works. Why? Since the outcome of Jess's dilemma - "How to Become a Female Professional Football Player of Indian Ancestry and Heritage Despite Parents' Near Hysterical Objections" - would be predicted by Martians attending their first terrestrial screening, the movie rises or falls on the script and the acting. And the cinematography.And "Beckham" makes it on all accounts. Jess is a pretty teenager who plays football (I think it has another name but I confuse soccer with rugby, knowing nothing of either) in a verdant park when "Jules," a lovely Caucasian scout for a girls' team recruits her. Jess surreptitiously joins the team without her parents' knowledge, our rising star employing intrigue, a cooperative older sister, cunning and outright lies to bamboozle her unsuspecting parents. For a while. Jess and her family live in an upscale home and neighborhood that I know few Indians reside in. Jules is a teenage girl any parent would want but few, I suspect, get. She's exasperated but engagingly tolerant with her mom (played wickedly by Juliet Stevenson) who embarrasses her in a lingerie department by trying to get her to use bra inserts so she will have a cleavage. Her mom can't understand her passion for her sport while her understanding dad not only encourages her but expresses joy that she'd rather kick a ball than be chasing boys. Mom just wants boys for her daughter. Are there mothers like that?Jules and Jess become close friends until, with cinematic inevitability, their individual attractions to their handsome coach (he's Irish to insure that all U.K. ethnicities are presented) leads to a rift. Relating that is no more a spoiler than mentioning that the film is in color.The girls' team is fully integrated. Race seems to be no issue at all. Yes, Jess has one unhappy moment when she's the subject of an epithet by an opposing player but any serious issues about discrimination and bigotry are outside Jess's and Jules's world. "Paki-bashing," a neologism coined to describe a chronic and despicable crime, is absent.Jess's family is devoted to Indian rituals and social mores which, naturally, include an imperative that marriage be within the ethnic community. Get what's coming up? I'll say no more. The families of Jess and Jules are shown in alternating scenes reflecting the director's clear wish to explore the supposed universality of parental love no matter what dishes are prepared in the kitchen.So despite the conventionality of the story, the sprightly acting and fast pace works. It's a fun film. It's been an extraordinary box office smash in Old Blighty and, supposedly, a professional girls' football team has been inaugurated because of this movie (devoid of an Empire, many Brits watching this film must have been stung by the repeated references to how good female footballers have it in the U.S.).The scenes of Jess's family life feature repeated feasts, meals and cooking lessons all showing glorious foods that I love. So no wonder was it that when "Bend It Like Beckham" ended I propelled myself out of the Lincoln Plaza Cinema across the street to Sapphire, one of the Upper West Side's best Indian restaurants, and succumbed to the attentive service and outstanding food there offered.Do not miss the outtakes accompanying the screen credits. And here's a new one: I'm always amused by how long the end credits are these days with every conceivable assistant listed. But this was the first time I saw a name attached to the position "Ethnic Publicity." Hmmm.7/10 (probably should be a "6" but I really enjoyed myself)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I read a less-than-enthusiastic review about BILB in the NY Daily News, and I approached the theater with low expectations. When I saw the crowd (in NYC, Lincoln Plaza Cinema) waiting for the 10:40 PM show, I thought "What's going on?"By the time it was over, I lost all respect for the movie critic who gave it a "sort-of-OK" review.Knowing as much about English popular culture as I do about Indian cinema (which is to say NOTHING), I had little trouble picking up on the conversations and the humor.It was a bit on the formulaic, predictable, feel-good side, but in light of the economy, war and the dismal state of Hollywood today (DareDevil excepted) this was a treat, delight and a barrel of laughs.All in all, it was a very enjoyable movie and I would recommend it to anyone who knows how to laugh, and a few who don't.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw Bend It Like Beckham last year while spending some time in the UK. I was relatively new to London when I first saw it, (still a certifiable stupid American) and never got the feeling that there were jokes going over my head. However, I've since become a bit more clued up and I enjoy it even more. The film is absolutely hilarious, and not only to those on the inside of UK football or Southeast Asian-British culture. (Although anyone who knows an Indian mom will have a particular appreciation for some of Chadha's humor).Aside from the humor, a great merit of the film is its balance. It deals with race, gender, second generation issues, family conflict and sports without ever getting cheesy or losing its humor and positivity. I credit the script and fantastic performances with managing these complex issues. But make no mistake, this ain't no Saturday afternoon special.I would like to recommend that Sky or the BBC hire Chadha and her camera department to shoot football matches for them, because no game has ever looked so exciting. I now understand why they call it the Beautiful Game. Soccer savvy fans and Americans who saw soccer for the first time in this year's World Cup will be glued to the screen in awe of the cinematography, and the moves those girls have!And in conclusion to my "Ode to BILB", the cast is spectacular. How nice to see new actors with so much talent! Chadha and her folks are making great progress in building up British cinema (and maybe even Bollywood, too). My fellow Americans, don't be scared! Bend It Like Beckham will be worth your while, even if you have no idea who Beckham is or what he bends.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Don't let the cover fools you. You will think this is just another chick flick or football mania flick, but apparently you are wrong. This is one of my favorite movie for the new year, because the story line is unusual,and it's not all about football, but it's more about cultural differences, how they deal with it, and how to pursue your dreams and not easily give up.The story begins with an Indian girl Jesminder Bhamra, who is obsessed with football and David Bechkam. She can only play football in the park with the boys, but then she get a chance offered by Jules Paxton to play in a real girl team, coached by Joe.The rest of the story is rather predictable. But I can assure you, that you won't be disappointed after you watch it. Get one for rental or buy... suggested :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bending Rules</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A comedy about bending the rules to reach your goal, BEND IT LIKE BECKHAM explores the world of women's football in the West London suburb of Hounslow. Paminder Nagra stars as teenager soccer whiz Jesminder whose parents are keen for her to hang up her football cleats, find a nice boyfriend, and learn to cook the perfect chapatti. Enter Kiera Knightley - the scrawniest footballer in history - who enlists Jes to play in a local women's league, much to the horror of her parents, especially her father, wonderfully played by Anupam Kher. Director Gurinder Chadha and her team of screenwriters keep the pace light and fun, making sure Jesminder's cultural conflict never strays from the boundaries of the comedic realm. A romantic subplot with Jes's Irish coach, played by Jonathan Rhys-Meyers, is less successful, and seems to intrude on the message of individuality and self-esteem.Luckily, the pacing of the movie is breezy and fast, and any moments that serve to slow the movie down don't last long. BEND IT LIKE BECKHAM is a winner. </fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bend It Like Beckham is the latest in a strong series of English comedies, in particular About a Boy, Billy Elliot and Bridget Jones, although it may seem like a weak teen comedy at first. Gurinder Chadha effectively hides the typical 'struggle against culture' under layers of charm, wit and an interweaved storyline. A must for all soccer fans and teenage girls, Bend It Like Beckham manages to be at times hilarious and obtains the rare feat of incorporating Indian culture into an entertaining movie. Even better, it has very little actual footage of David Beckham!Best bit: Juliet Stevenson (Jules' mum) steals every scene she is in! Worst bit: Falls into the standard 'parents walking in on you' scene a few times too often. 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bend it like Beckham has a great comedy element.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Indian parents of the 18-year old Jess (Parminder K. Nagra) know exactly what their daughter should become: a solicitor and a good wife. But Jess doesn't really take into consideration her parent's plans. She has a passion for playing soccer like her hero, David Beckham.. The teenager thinks of a career as female Beckham, but her mother only thinks about her daughter's marriage. A girl playing soccer isn't considered to be an appropriate Indian pastime. But soccer is Jess' great passion and thanks to her new friend Jules (Keira Knightley) she starts thinking of playing soccer professionally. Her parents don't accept her passion, therefore she has to keep it a secret.There's also a subplot, when Jess and Jules fall for their coach Joe (Jonathan Rhys-Meyers). Finally Joe and Jess fall in love with each other.From my point of view, Jess, the main charakter, is wonderful in her role. She's very convincing as someone who feels different in some way. She doesn't really respond to the interests and customs of those surrounding her.The main entertaining element of the film rests with Jess' family. The mother is particularly so out of touch with her daughter. She wants to groom her daughter in the ways of becoming a proper Indian bride. The movie is funny because it is truthful, not because it is wacky.While there's enough conflict throughout the film, it's almost all in the same formula as Billy Elliot. But Bend it like Beckham has a greater comedy element than Billy Elliot. In my opinion Billy Elliot did flow much better towards the end of the film, whereas Bend it like Beckham runs on too long. A shorter ending would have been absolutely perfect.Gurinder Chadha, the director of the film, turns this film about a clash between traditional values and the modern world into an exhilarating feelgood movie. It is set up as an Asian comedy, but it is also a great football movie, with some hilariously surreal moments. Bend it like Beckham is the latest Brit-comedy after Bridget Jones's Diary(2001).From my point of view David Beckham ought to be proud to have his name on such a great movie.The personal struggle of Jess and the great comedy elements are what make Bend it like Beckham one of the most successful films in terms of charm</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's the story of a young football fanatic who practices in the London park whenever the chance arises and recounts the days events to a poster of English soccer captain David Beckham every night. What's so different about this film is that the football fan is Jesminder Bharma - a girl and an Indian to boot. Jessie is forced to rebel against her family, who are preparing for a big Indian wedding, and all that she knows to pursue her dream. Playing with the all girl Hounslow Harriers football team is all she lives for until she is offered something bigger ? and it clashes with her sister's wedding. Under Gurinder Chadha's direction Parminder Nagra is utterly believable as the football fanatic, delivering a touching performance that will have the person most uninterested in soccer routing for her. Also scoring top marks for her performance as Jessie's friend and team mate Juliette Paxton is Keira Knightly. Their coach, Joe, is a bit of a rough diamond and played accordingly by Dublin-born Jonathan Rhys-Meyers. Bend It Like Beckham is one of those films that leaves you feeling good about life and inspires you to pursue your dreams despite the odds.</fullReview>

You don't need to be a football expert or fan to enjoy the movie. The film's important issues are girl power, generation gaps and family relationships - things that are universal.This movie had me laughing hysterically. If you enjoy movies that leave you constantly guessing until the end what will happen, then yes, this is not the movie for you. But if you enjoy a "chick flick" with a lot of laughter, fun and happy endings then you will adore this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having seen Bhaji and East is East, I wasn't looking forward to seeing this. The first two films, though very funny, were not true reflections of Indians/Asians in England. For a start they were wholly focussed on s.e.x., black/white boyfriends/girlfriends, unwanted pregnancies, etc, etc for some reason.To my surprise this film was totally different. It concentrated on the dream of an Asian girl wanting to play football against her family's wishes/traditions. This movie could have worked just as well if it was a boy. It was very well filmed (in the middle of summer) and the scenes of Southall/Hounslow made me feel like I was there (I'm not by the way, but I have seen the place(s)).I recommend this film to anyone who dreamed of playing semi-pro or professional football, as well as to anyone who wants to see a good family yarn. The director (Chadda) has provided a good balance of humour and family life without going over the top. The acting overall is to a good standard and only Julia Stevenson goes a little OTT as the neurotic middle class English mother. But this just adds to the humour!A sidenote warning: If witnessing yet another 18 year old Asian wearing a Vodafone shirt makes you sick (as it does me) then I suggest you hide behind the sofa for the opening moments of the film. After that, thankfully, she only wears the Hounslow Harriet outfit and this makes for much more comfortable and pleasant viewing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lovely comedy about football &amp; cultural conflict</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Similar in some ways to Swedish movie "Jalla, Jalla", this movie deals with the collision between "traditional" values in an immigrant family (girls are to get married, life before marriage is preparation for marriage) and the opportunities present to girls in contemporary western society (soccer is a nice way to get scholarships and a wish to be free). The tone of the movie is quite light in the face of what in many other movies is portrayed as a tragedy. Which is very suitable and makes this movie a nice evening's entertainment, while still illustrating some important and interesting points about culture clash. The Sikh family of main character 1, Jesminder, is not the only problem. Main character 2, Juliette, also has an interesting family with an overprotective/worried mother who wants her to be more like a true girl (and thus like herself when she was young). And main character 3, Joe, claims that being Irish is a bit like being a Sikh. And he might have a good point...One slightly unfortunate part of the plot is that it is a bit stereotypical that both fathers are the ones to in some way support the girls. The mothers are considered a bit more conservative, which leaves a bad aftertaste. But not much, really.But do see this movie if you get a chance!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>brilliant entertainment, even though not profound</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jesminder (Jess) Bhamra [Parminder K. Nagra] is fond of football and quite good at it. Being brought up in a Hindu family, with her parents lacking understanding for her hobby, her sister wondering why Jess should prefer football to boys, obviously does not make life easier for her. Jess sees herself forced to lie to attend the training of a girls' football team she has managed to get into. There she makes friends with Jules [Keira Knightley], a girl who has high aspirations concerning her own (future) football career. Jess finally finds herself in a struggle with her own aims and dreams and the plans her parents have made for her, trying to obey them without giving up her dream of becoming a professional player. On top of it all she has to face a further conflict, since she does not know how to handle the affectionate feelings she has for her Irish trainer [Jonathan Rhys Meyers].The actors did a good job, especially Parminder Nagra. At times you can really sense Jess' despair. I guess this film is not representative of Jonathan Rhys Meyers' actual talent, but his role is too reduced to be played with profound emotion.'Bend it like Beckham' is definitely a film full of energy. It makes you grin and leave the cinema with a feeling of content and happiness.A simple plot? Maybe. Maybe neither unique nor inventive. NEVERTHELESS 'Bend it...' is a brilliant and fresh comedy, a sentimental story about growing up, taking responsibility for your own decisions and living your dreams. The viewers find themselves on a roller coaster ride from everyday life to Hindu traditions, from the pompous Hindu celebrations to the atmosphere at a football stadium. The excellent music perfectly conveys the various moods.A good comedy should leave you amused and touched in some way. 'Bend it...' definitely made me smile, smirk and laugh tears. It even made me feel quite melancholic at times. Brilliant entertainment. I could not wish for more.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Warning - the following review will contain many references to the England football team -anyone unfamiliar with eleven men who should be the best in the world, but ultimately fail to deliver can email for a good old moan!!!This film follows a pretty predictable formula - culture clashes, girls can't play football, "am I in love with my new best friend's fella?", romance and a little bit of talent win out in the end - you know the sort of thing.This is not to say it wasn't enjoyable but I couldn't help feeling it could have been a whole lot more. Yes, it's fantasy (the last minute winner - I ask you! Who ever scores free kicks in the last minute to win a vital match? David who???) but the cultural conflict plot seemed a bit thin (like the current state of England's left side midfield), it sagged a little in the middle (witness most of England's games in the last World Cup), and didn't have the strength upfront to make it world class.Where the England team would have ultimately suffered noble defeat in time-honoured tradition this film goes straight for the glory ending.Doesn't quite have the legs to carry it off for the full ninety minutes but was not bad in patches. Sadly didn't quite live up to it's full potential (now who does that remind me of????)Definately a film of two halves.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An absolutely delightful film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went to see "Bend it like Beckham", the other night and found it to be one of the most delightful films I have ever seen. The various character interplays between members of Jessie's family was absolutely delightful as were the various interplays between members of Jules's family. The traditional ways of the Indian family certainly did not sit well on the shoulders of a young 19 year old girl growing up in London. The opening was superb, and I like the rest of the people in the theatre thought this girl playing for England was for real, only to find that it was all in her head.Some superb shots of London at it's best(meaning summer), was lovely to see.Good interplays between the English (of Caucasian decent) and the Indian characters.An all together excellent film, thoroughly recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Saw Bend It while in London this summer, then twice on the charter plane back to Canada. Twice on the plane wasn't due to trans-Atlantic boredom, just pure enjoyment.If there's any justice, this film will do very well in North America, especially with fans of Britflicks, ethnic flicks and soccer kids/Moms. The basic message is one of empowerment and acceptance. The "football" scenes are uncommonly well handled and the racial and sexual issues are dealt with in a deft fashion. I'm a bit of a cynic regarding "feel good movies" but this one left me with a big smile and no guilt. May not get a big theatrical release over here, but likely to do very well indeed on video.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can't believe I put off seeing this for so long. I'm not a fan of soccer in the slightest and I had just waved this movie off as some 'dopey sports movie'. But after a couple of friends had recommended it, (and the fact that I had seen everything else at the cineplex), I decided to give it a shot.This is a fantastic movie. Yes, it's about soccer, a girl's soccer team in fact, but it is about so much more as well. The basic theme is about doing what makes you happy and going for it without being afraid, but it also takes a long hard look at cultural boundaries and family ties.I can find nothing to fault this film on. The soundtrack absolutely rocked, the actors all did a fine job, and the story really draws the audience in. It will make you laugh, and it might even draw a tear. But you will definitely come out feeling warm and fuzzy all over. I highly recommend this film, one of the best I have seen. </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Toronto International Film Festival Award Winner!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bend It Like Beckham had its North American Premiere at the2002 Toronto International Film Festival this week. At today's Award Ceremony, the movie won an honorable mention for theAGF People's Choice Award. The Toronto festival is uniquebecause the big award presented at the end is voted on by thepublic, not by critics or film-makers. Bend It Like Beckham wasone of 2 runners' up for this honor. It's a real feel-good film in thetradition of "The Full Monty" or "Billy Elliot." Parminder Nagra isJess, whose traditional Indian family frowns on her desire to be asoccer player. Respectable Indian girls don't show their ankles,and they don't run around playing with boys. They learn how tocook and look after their husbands. So when Jules (KeiraKnightley) asks Jess to join her women's soccer team, the sparksfly. And when she falls in love with Joe, (Jonathan Rhys-Meyers)her decidedly non-Indian coach, both her family and her new bestfriend Jules (who is also in love with the young man) decideenough is enough! Director Gurinder Chadha tells a great story,brimming with both drama and humor. This movie is hilarious,and Chadha gets a lot of laughs from the ethnic backgrounds ofher characters. In the hands of a non-Indian director this moviecould have been derivative, even offensive, but the humor isaffectionate, and the director admits, autobiographical. ShaheenKhan is absolutely hilarious as a mother trying desperately tomake her daughters conform to her old-world, decidedlyUN-European sense of respectability. But the movie is not aboutrace, it's about friendship, and family, and hope. Nagra andKnightley are terrific as two friends desperate to achieve theirdreams, and Chadha is unabashedly hopeful. You can't help butcheer for Jess and Jules, and you won't be disappointed! Thismovie is already a huge hit in England, and I'm sure it'll also be acrowd favorite on this side of the Atlantic. I loved it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very enjoyable night out if you don't want to see anything deep</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'m not sure exactly why I'm going to give 'Bend It Like Beckham' such a good rating. There are many other movies which I have given 7 to which are technically much better (in terms of acting, script, sound, look), such as 'Minority Report' or 'Blue Velvet'. But well, 'Beckham' is just so damn likeable.The story is about Jess (Parminder Nagra), an English girl of Indian descent who idolises David Beckham and loves to play soccer. However her traditionalist parents frown on their daughter running around getting muddy and showing everyone her legs, and want Jess to be like her older sister, who is about to get married. So Jess secretly joins a womens team that her friend Jules (Keira Knightly, who is absolutely gorgious) plays for. Many of the best laughs in the film come from Jule's ditsy Mum, who also frowns on her daughter doing some so unfeminine as playing football. Not only is there trouble with both girls parents, they both fancy their coach Joe (the equally gorgious Jonathan Rhys-Meyers).'Beckham' is a lot like 'Monsoon Wedding' in that it features one of those wonderfully colourful Indian weddings and highlights the sometimes uneasy meeting of Indian and Western cultures, though it does not have the richness of style and emotion that that film does. I'll get my criticisms out of the way first: some of the camera work is dizzying, there are a couple of moments when it gets a bit mushy and Jonathan Rhys-Meyers' performance is not always convincing. But it almost seems mean to be hard on this movie - it is a simple, straightforward and funny story, the kind of enjoyable, low-budget comedy-drama like 'The Full Monty' or 'Brassed Off' that the British do very well. It is nothing amazing but nor does it try to be. At the end of it you come out feeling good. And it is hard to argue with that.7/10</fullReview>

Of course the story can be viewed as being formulaic. What girl meets boy story doesn't use the same situational hooks? But the soccer background gives this one a fresh perspective.And Parminder K Nagra shows real promise. Look for a lot more from her. And look for more, too, from Jonathan Rhys-Meyers</fullReview>

		<fullReview>for a non-english viewer, this indian-british comedy is a true delight. the story is teenage-highschool, but dealt with in a much more earnest and embarrassing (in an endearing manner) way than most american counterparts. also, the parents of the two girls have a lot of screentime and are more fleshed out characters than usual. the central story of girl-friendship combined with sport is unusual in itself, but because of it, the film has all the energy and drive of a sports movie, with winning and losing moments. the love triangle is a little weak in my opinion, since both girls´ main interest seems to be the sport. still, its always great to see the hugely talented jonathan rhys meyers appear on the big screen, so its just too bad, its such a small and almost unnecessary role!i truly enjoyed the film with its youthful energy and hilarious family situations. there is a lot of the "goodness, gracious me" humor in it, but thats always rather a good thing, i find.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>CAUTION: SPOILER OR TWO:Billy Eliot goes with Gregory's Girl to the Kumars at Number 42 to see What's Cooking at their Monsoon Wedding (Hounslow version). East is East and the family are Brassed Off, but Billy ends up On the Way to San Jose, instead of My Beautiful Law School, after doing the Full Monty On Any Given Sunday. This movie touches a lot of bases. Yes, it's relentlessly cheerful, `safe' (whatever that means), relies strongly on comedy cliches such as ridiculous misunderstandings and pokes fun at easy targets such as people with strange clothes and funny accents (eg English soccer players), but it does have something to say about the clash of cultures, if only that the more dynamic one is likely to prevail, but itself mutate in the process.There are some strong performances from the leads, particularly from Parminder Nagra as Jess the aspiring soccer star. Her eager enthusiasm is balanced by a regard for family feeling even when the viewer thinks `oh sod them'. Jonathan Rhys-Myers as her coach gives a measured performance (a long way from his crazed Steerpike in `Gormenghast') and Keira Knightley (only 16) is perfectly fine as Jess's friend and rival Jules. Jess's Mum and Dad, played by Shaneen Khan and Anupam Kher, veer on the edge of parody but they win our sympathies also. Juliet Stephenson as Jule's Mum puts in the only real slapstick performance, and is good enough to get away with it.The planes lumbering overhead (this is flightpath country) are an interesting motif, for the airline industry seems to employ many of the characters. The last 30 years have seen air travel become a reality for almost anyone in developed countries, and for a substantial group in other places. Finding a Sikh customs officer behind the counter at Heathrow is now unremarkable, as is the spread of Indian food in England. Yet this cultural blending has its stresses and strains, as is evident from contemporary politics in a number of European countries. A film like this takes an optimistic view ? a girl from a Punjabi Sikh background can win the approval, or at least the consent, of her parents to her entry into a very non-traditional occupation ? professional sport. There are probably lots of kids in her position who have deferred to their parent's wishes and limited their opportunities. Sometime tradition works ? arranged marriages are often happy ones - but inevitably its scope must be reduced when surrounded by modern western culture (if there is such a thing ? perhaps it's what Australians might term `Clayton's culture' ? the culture you're having when you don't have a culture).Anyway, as a film this was a pleasure to watch and I won't hold it against the director if I remember nothing about it in six months' time, as was the case with her earlier `What's Cooking'. No, that's not quite fair ? I do remember the food. This time I think I'll remember the dignified Indian ladies in saris kicking a soccer ball around on the Hounslow Harrier's pitch. Actually, that was an out-take shown in the credits, but it summed up the movie somehow.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had high expectations of this film after hearing all the good reviews for it, and fortunately it reached those expectations, as often I am let down by a highly hyped film.It wasn't overly hilarious but it was amusing in a 'light' comedy way (there were a lot of gay and lesbian cracks i must say). The storyline was effective, and the Jess-Joe-Jules triangle was cute.Parminder was great as Jess (although I'm not convinced of her football skills, but then again its better to have a good actor than a good footballer with hopeless acting), and the Rhys-Meyers guy was very appealing as Joe. I'm not sure if Jules was meant to be a likeable character or not, because I actually found her irritating and I didn't feel sorry for her when she saw Jess and Joe. She seemed a little full of herself but perhaps thats just how I saw it.Bend It Like Beckham (Indians not accepted by British)was a lot of Looking For Alibrandi (Italians not accepted by Australians) but with added football.You don't have to like football...it's entertaining enough for someone who hates it. I enjoyed this movie immensely but nothings perfect so I give it 9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Feel good movie with a cultural twist</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bend It Like Beckham (BILB) isn't an original movie by any stretch of the imagination. The "talented individual held back by family concerns" tale has been well used by writers, as is the "coming of age" story that usually accompanies such a tale. Despite this lack of originality, BILB still manages to hit all its marks with some great performances from its cast, and is worth seeing as a popcorn film.The use of Continental Indian culture in England as the backdrop of the film was interesting, with some of the film's funniest scenes coming from the playful mocking of this culture. At points it does seem to skate into the it's-funny-because-they're-different territory, but this is kept to a minimum. For those who dislike soccer (or sport in general) there's no need to worry - BILB keeps the technicalities of soccer to a minimum and the matches are all shown in highight format. Those who live soccer as a religion may be irked by the match footage (the girls are moving well under full pace and all goals come from point blank range) but this is a small gripe. All of the cast put in solid performances, with Parminder K. Nagra (Jess) impressively able to carry weight of the film's focus.Every now and then the film does slip into looking and feeling like a british television show rather than a movie, but this isn't a huge problem. My major snipe at the film was the ending - I'm not a big "feel good" movie fan and the saccharine final minutes did have me squirming in my chair. But this is a small point; overall BILB is well worth spending a couple of hours with for a dose of light entertainment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Charming and Heartwarming.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This charming, heartwarming film from the director of What's Cooking and Bhaji on the Beach was a major hit at the British Box Office and it's easy to see why. Despite not having any major stars the acting is first class, and it's three young leads - Parminder Nagra, Jonathan Rhys Meyers and Keira Knightley are immensely appealing. Although the film relies heavily upon its young cast, the storyline is a universal one, that of a youngster seeking their parents approval to do something that they had previously considered unsuitable for their child. The film comes with added elements, throwing in the clash of cultures so prevalent now in Britain. Our heroines are white and Asian, and the acceptance and embracing of each other's cultures is one of the films strongest suits. When doing this sort of film, it is very easy to turn the parents into stereotypical bad guys, the director resists this temptation and the film is much stronger for it, the parents are as likeable and sympathetic as their children.If only all British films were this good.</fullReview>

I thought it was an interesting set up, Jess and Jules really had a passion for the game and it allowed them to build a friendship from the completely diverse backgrounds. We got to see that it doesn't matter what country you are from, there are still prominent issues that can really bring or divide a family. Joe was a fantastic part to the development of Jess and Jule's friendship, and I thought the idea of Jess and Joe was adorable. Rather than everything being perfect in the end, they put a more realistic twist to their relationship allowing us to believe there's hope after all.I thought it was a great film</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Parminder Nagra may not be David Beckham, but she might just be God</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***spoiler or two***Despite its modern gloss, hybrid cultural influence and saucy language, this is an extremely familiar and old-fashioned mix of comedy of errors movies and sporting aspiration movies. But it's still very enjoyable indeed, even if the director tends to manipulate the viewer just a little bit too much.Some critics have closed in on the all-but-consummated homosexual attraction between the two main female characters, and even though there are enough gay panic scenes in Bend It Like Beckham to fill a hundred movies, I tend to think the writers wanted to avoid the stereotype of dykey young girls being the most attracted to sport. Read into it what you like. Just about everything seems possible - and permissible - by the end of the film, and it's a great feeling.Gay or straight, Indian or English or neither, whatever category you rely on to classify her character, Parminder Nagra is achingly beautiful and inspiring and is the one major character in the film to evade caricature (compare the broad comedy of Juliet Stevenson as her friend's mother; she's a million miles from Truly Madly Deeply here). You can really understand why Jonathan Rhys-Meyers falls for Nagra so hard. I sure did. Her performance is just sublime. Not many actors could so convincingly pull off a transformation from a trakky-dak wearing frump in the opening scenes to a sensual, glowing, sort-of-liberated woman at the end (whether wearing a sari at her sister's wedding or flying off to the US to launch her career) through playing football.And who knows? It's this kind of movie that might just ease ethnic tensions in England. What better an advertisement and incentive for having the courage to go for the one your desire dictates regardless of colour or culture (or gender)?Sadly, US audiences will be unlikely to access or embrace this film or its relatively unknown actors. Nagra herself would appear more likely to be shuttling between London and Bollywood rather than Hollywood in the future. But who cares? Wherever she goes I figure there will be a no shortage of moviegoers like me ready to follow.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a sheer delight of a film. OK, the cliched plot-line is straight out of a cheap comic: young footballer overcomes personal obstacles to score winning goal in final seconds of crucial match. But the twist is that the 18 year old football fanatic is a girl - and she's Asian to boot!Parminder Nagra is utterly credible as Jess, inspired by her Manchester United hero David Beckham and encouraged by her English friend Jules (Keira Knightley) and Irish coach Joe (Rhys Meyers), but thwarted by Indian parents trying hard to maintain their religious and social traditions in west London's Hounslow (just down the road from where I live).Director and co-writer Gurinder Chadha presents a wry and very funny observation of the culture clash and its ultimate resolution in a movie brimming with sharp dialogue and comedic scenes, all enlivened by a superb sound track. </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>inconsistently funny culture clash</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I loathe football so the title was a put off. Having seen the trailer however I thought more may lie behind it, and I was right. The basic premise is a football obsessed Indian girl jess (parminder nagra) fighting the expectations of her family to settle into an arranged marriage and a middle class career. The football does little more than set the background and the script could equally well have substituted music or cars for football - but I suspect the football &amp; hence title was created with an eye to publicity.What was rather disappointing was the insistence of a lurve interest in the form of a football coach joe (jonathan rhys-myers) who falls for her and a causes a fight with the other main protagonist jules (played by kiera knightley). Tedious and irrelevant and really a waste of screen time that could have been deployed to make a funny film much richer. jules encourages jess to pursue her interest and overcome her unwillingness to fight her family and shyness. Lots of irreverent self-criticism of Indian culture - with parodying of the social climbing of Indians, competitive sari wearing and bubble headed young Indian fashion victims. Strong performance by Jess's father (anupam kher). Kiera knightley is hugely pretty but her acting is a tad, ermmm, American in some places, too method. Tone back those expressions honey. Special mention for Juliet Stevenson performance as jess's mother failing entirely to comprehend why a girl should be interested in football and fighting the same battle to encourage her daughter to pursue girly hobbies. One of the funniest themes of the film was her mistakenly misinterpreting of her daughters friendship with jess as a lesbian affair, and struggling hilariously to comprehend and accept it.Cameo appearances by some of the 'Goodness gracious me' team assorted football pundits and inevitably David Beckham and wife Victoria.Funny and well worth watching.definitely Recommended</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great multi-cultural laughter fest!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film was quite simply a breath of fresh air.There is many a good belly laugh as the film weaves its way cleverly through cultural barriers, misconceptions and breakthroughs from beginning to end.Two young women, one asian and one european coming together around soccer growing up, falling out and experiencing life with a relationship building towards loving friendship.In the UK much has been made over the past year of ethnic tensions in towns such as Oldham and Bradford and the increasing legitimacy of Nazi groups such as the British National Party who have become an "acceptable face" of facism and racism.This film serves to remind us that by telling a story to good effect even a comedy can have a very positive effect in breaking down society's barriers and opening peoples minds.The audiences reaction in the cinema was quite telling. There were moments of universal mirth as everyone got the joke and certain other times when only pockets of the audience understood. Despite this at the end of the film, it was telling that few people rushed off, with most of us waiting to see the hilarious credits roll to completion.I am one of the people who missed out on "Bhaji on the Beach" but I will be certainly checking this out on video now.Very Good. 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best British women's football film since Gregory's Girl</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>** MINOR SPOILERS **This film is like that epitome of 70's cuisine Angel Delight. It's got slightly cheesy packaging that promises a wholesome and uplifting experience. What you get is something that leaves you grinning but also with a nasty chemical aftertaste, an intangible emptiness and the feeling that the government has just tested a new happy drug on you to quell your rebellious spirit.The heroine, Jess is a 'typical' Hounslow dwelling girl with a gift for the nutmeg and the dribble, who dreams of big things and scoring for United and David Beckham. Unfortunately her parents see her as a) a lawyer and b) married with kids. Many set pieces ensue with Jess hiding her footballing activities in order to avoid confronting her parents over her future. Ultimately, of course, the big show down has to happen and does during her sister's wedding.Let's just say it's not all that surprising. A quicker summary would be to say Gregory's Girl as performed in the style of Goodness Gracious Me (UK sketch show, not Peter Sellers). And that's it, there's nothing more. Intangible emptiness. Big grin. Has someone slipped me something? This popcorn tastes funny.OK you could go on about the stereotypes. But then British film and British comedy are big on stereotypes. In some cases they're justified and funny and in some cases they're clumsy and so unfunny you feel the need to complain to someone about them. For every Danny the Dealer and Camp Freddy there's a cockney gangster #2 or a blue-rinse matriarch. Bend it Like Beckham's are just about OK, but I did feel they're walking very close to the edge of tackiness and tastelessness.I would add that I work in the College that most of Southall's youth attend when they're doing their A-levels and the portrayal of the girls shopping and the boys playing football is *spot* on. These people really exist...I don't doubt the director's motives for making this film, but I do question the studio's morals in marketing it. The Bollywood film market is the UK is huge and getting bigger by the day. The World Cup is round the corner. David Beckham is Hello magazine's number one dreamboat. So what better than a lot of zeitgeisty stuff crammed into 90 odd minutes of celluloid and marketed in a surprisingly big way. Don't forget this film premiered at the 1500 seat Odeon in Leicester Square. What could be a strong feminist statement of a film, what could be the first 100% mainstream 100% British-Asian film with a really big studio push is just an average Brit-com coining it in for the shareholders. It's a Mike Leigh film with most of the social commentary replaced by poor jokes and an injection of mass-produced optimism. I feel that I've been promised something then been let down badly. Intangible emptiness, mindless grin, feel-good but real-bad.So, go if you must, but don't eat the popcorn. I'm going back to my Billy Bragg records.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another British hit!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jess is an Indian girl whose dream is to become a professional football player like her idol David Beckham. However, her traditional parents want her to do well in her A-Levels so that she can become a lawyer. Jules (Keira Knightley), a member of the local ladies football team spots Jess playing in the park one day and is so impressed by Jess's natural talent that she persuades her to try out for the team. On joining, Jess helps the team reach the finals but is unable to tell her parents because they are so strict. Her dream of becoming a professional player is in jeopardy when the date of her sister's wedding is set on the same day as the final match. Where this story tugs the emotions is the realisation that Jess wants her parents to be proud of her and she wants to demonstrate her respect by doing what they want but in doing so, she is risking her future happiness by sacrificing an opportunity of a lifetime. Here is a heroine worth rooting for. The supporting cast is also good: Jonathan Rhys-Meyers as the team's coach smoulders sex appeal and Keira Knightley reminds me of a taller and younger Winona Ryder. Juliet Stevenson is hilarious as Jules mother who fears her tomboy daughter is a lesbian. Also look out for dubious cameo appearances by Posh and Becks towards the end of the film. References to Indian tradition and culture during the film are a little bewildering and some of the audience may find it difficult to relate to the restrictions imposed by family and tradition that the younger generation seem to be faced with. Nevertheless, there is a good deal of laugh out loud moments and some of the scenes do have a 'Goodness Gracious Me' feel about them. The ending is predictable. The release of a British film is often accompanied by comparisons with recent successes such as 'The Full Monty', 'East is East' (personally I thought these two films were overrated) and 'Billy Elliot'. I feel the closest comparison would be with the latter in this film's ability to combine the right balance of pathos and humour. 'Bend It like Beckham' deserves to be a hit.</fullReview>

Her parents, however, have other ideas and want her to marry a respectable Indian man and learn to cook the perfect chapatti, like her sister Pinky.Complications arise when Jess gets involved in a local girl's football team and meets the charismatic Julia and the gorgeous coach, Joe.The script is delightful and gets better and better throughout the movie.

Even when I think of it now it brings a smile.This is a feel good film, thats all it is and a brilliant one it is too.The sound track is mind blowing. I'm sure a lot of British Asians can relate to this film and get alot of the in-jokes that may be a bit thin on others.The film is about a 18 year old asian girl, who wants to break with tradition and become a footballer just like her idol David Beckham.She joins a womans football team, which clashes with her family life. She has to chose between strict indian traditions or football.The plot isn't very complicated, and for this kind of film i dont think it should be. But it does keep you interested until the end.So go and watch this film, it is not average. For get the world and your troubles for two hours and enjoy.a definite 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Likeable, but lacks dramatic tension</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a feelgood teddybear of a movie: warm, fuzzy and distinctly non-threatening. The problem I had with it, however, is that everyone in the film was so nice and reasonable that I never felt that very much was at stake. The film's message seemed to be that there's no problem that can't be solved by sitting down with a cup of tea and talking through your feelings. Where were the tensions and personality clashes within the team, for example? True, there was the Jules/Jess/Joe love triangle subplot, but even that fizzled out after a while, and I found it hard to believe anyway. Jules is a) clearly a lovely person and b) played by the radiantly beautiful Keira Knightley so, without wishing to sound ungallant, I found myself wondering what Joe would see in Jess (sorry Parminder).Having said all this, Bend It Like Beckham is an enjoyable enough way to cheer yourself up on a wet Sunday afternoon, even if, like me, you have no interest in football. 6/10</fullReview>

But the film has mant very amusing moments too. Above all the film celebrates family love and respect and the striving of two young girls to be themselves.

		<fullReview>Commenting on this film, if you can call it that, is necessary because it is so bad. Here is another example of how to kill off the once brilliant British Film Industry. A bad screenplay, compounded by a bad director, by bad acting and sick to your stomach lies which we call 'Hype' nowadays. It appears that this bad director, remember WHAT'S COOKING? &amp; BHAJI ON THE BEACH, has gone one step further in establishing herself as nothing but a glamour puss who believes that the hard working, money earning audiences are so stupid that they will come to see the movie because she has the name BECKHAM in the title, a girls football team therefore possibility of PORKY's style changing room scenes, two girls hugging on the poster therefore the possible promise of lesbianism. EXCUSE ME there is nothing scandalous about being GAY or LESBIAN and it is cheap to try and score drooling boy/girl audiences on the premise of that. Save your money and do not bother. Once again I say that a studio, producer, director who chooses to think of the movie going audience as suckers/stupid/watch any crap do not deserve our hard earnt dollars. This thing is bad and should be given a wide miss.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>TV marketed as Cinema.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As with films like 'A Room for Romeo Brass' &amp; 'Mike Bassett: England Manager' this is more suited to British Television. Problem is British TV is becoming more concerned with digital futures and wall to wall soap-operas. Focus group market research probably reveals that a film like 'Bend it like Beckham' isn't a soap or a lazy reality show or 'Who wants to be a millionaire'. So it goes to the limited world of British cinema. The title alone demonstrates the populist intentions of the films marketing; what was the original title? Add to this the obligatory third-rate celebrity cameos-we get Gary Linekar- this is another tactic that Brit-flicks like 'Mike Bassett' &amp; 'Spice World' use. Again,it's out of fear that the audience will find the work 'unfamiliar'.British cinema is in a poor state- it only makes a few kind of films: the Polygram-Tarantino copy (Guy Ritchie, Danny Boyle), the costume/heritage ('Sense &amp; Sensibility' et al), the quarter-written lottery funded script ('Shooting Fish'),the anti-Thatcher polemic feelgood comedy ten years too late ('Brassed Off'; 'Full Monty'),the sub-Mike Leigh or sub-'Kes' type ('A Room for Romeo Brass'; 'Ratcatcher') and the talented child truimphs adversity ('Billy Eliot'; that one with Robert Carlyle &amp; Ray Winstone). It wishes it was making American-funded pseudo-British films whose vast profits rturn to Hollywood- 'Harry Potter', 'Bridget Jones Diary', 'Notting Hill'. Instead we have to settle for works deliberately made to appeal to a vague populist notion of audiences- such as this film. This might make fine Sunday night TV- but does not compete with films like 'Memento' (directed in America by a Brit!), 'Eloge de l'amour', 'Amelie', 'Mulholland Drive', 'The Piano Teacher', 'The Devils Backbone', 'Amorros Peros' &amp; 'The Believer'- which have all won critcial acclaim &amp; found an audience- whilst possessing a degree of originality and something to say cinematically. Will people watch 'Bend it like Beckham' for its editing?, its structure? or its ambience?Problem is producers are scared of arthouse- like the idea of 'Lord of the Rings' or 'Star Wars' level profits &amp; the cinema cartel who distribute films tend to plump for US-films (usually so they can get the blockbusters like 'Gladiator'). 85% of films made in this country don't get a cinematic release- 'Bend it like Beckham' does achieve that- but I feel that a more original work like 'Christie Malry's Own Double-Entry' deserves distribution &amp; support (make that deserve,past-tense). 'Bend it like Beckham' is a TV-movie &amp; demonstration that the UK cannot look beyond its limited concept of what passes for cinema. I'm with Emma Thompson on the notion of the British film industry...</fullReview>

"Beckham" is full of sharp, but respectful, satire of the "Innit" generation of Anglo-Indians growing up in the shadow of Heathrow airport, and with a cracking cast that add a ring of authenticity to a really well scripted movie. Juliet Stevenson is hilarious as Jules' push-up bra mum.The movie deftly mixes football prodigy Jess' head-on clashes with her sweet but traditionally minded parents and her developing relationship with Jules, her football buddy. The girls' football sequences are very convincing and the sound track rocks."East is East" looks very dreary by comparison.Verdict: I loved it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Bend it like Beckham" This movie has nothing to do with David Beckham, famous football player. It is a comedy of teenage Indian British girl who live in London. Here are the main characters!! Jess is heroine of this movie. Jules is a member of the girl's football team. Joe is a coach of the girl's football team. Pinky is Jess's older sister. Tony is Jess's friend. He is an Indian British boy. The Story!! Jess feels great interest in football. However, her family doesn't feel good about her because they are Indian family that treasures their traditional very much. Her mother is against football and wish Jess to behave more womanly. One day, Jules see Jess playing football at the park and scout Jess to the girl's football team. Thanks to Tony, Jess decides to join team secretly. As time passes, Jess becomes close friends with Jules and Joe. Meanwhile, Pinky and her family are busy preparing for Pinky's wedding. Pinky follows her traditional and marry Indian guy. At the last minute, it comes out that Jess has been telling a lie to her family and she is in love with a white boy Joe. There for, Jess's dad doesn't allow Jess to go to a football game but the game is very important for her because talent scout for famous football school is coming to see the game. What Jess is going to do next? My Review!! This is a hilarious movie so every time I watch this movie, I always feel happy, excitement and refreshment. I like chick flicks which teenage girl is trying to do her best to make her dreams come true. It always encourages me to do something. All chick flicks has to be a predictable movie and this movie as well. However, this is entertaining movie so you can enjoy it just for fun. Especially, I really enjoy football game scene. The screen play of Indian family is very funny. This movie tells you about importance of dream, hope and courage. We never make our dreams come true without difficulties. Therefore, this movie tells you a message "Never give up". Also it tells that family always be your great support. It is very heart-warming part. I like most of the plot but there is one that I don't. The part that I don't like about the plot is the eternal triangle among Jess, Jules and Joe. Not only Jess but also Jules loves Joe. I hate watching people being in love with his or her best friend's favorite person.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The reason I like women's football</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I saw Bend it like Beckham for the first time I wasn't sure if i'd like it. I also knew very little about women's football.I loved the film and it really inspired me to start following women's football. It's a film that men and women can enjoy equally.This is still my favourite Keira Knightly film (though I've yet to see Atonement. Parminda Nagra is also great as Jess. They both are believable as footballersThe ending is a bit corny with Jess scoring the winner with a Beckham like free kick, especially as the way she kicks it would cause the ball to canon into the wall. But that shouldn't detract from what is a very good film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dissing this movie makes me feel so bad, because the creators are clearly good people who want the world to be a better place. But herein lies the problem. The 'messages' are so unambiguously morally right that they become grindingly obvious clichés. Sexism is bad. Racism is bad. It's OK to be gay. The children of immigrants often have trouble reconciling two cultures. Growing up is tough, but kids and parents can usually get along if they work at it. All these are perfectly sound observations, but they're laid on with such a lack of subtlety that you just want to scream.And scream I did during the exchange between Jess and her coach, when he reminds her that he does understand prejudice as well, because "I'm Irish". It's almost as if the writer was just tidying up the final draft, and suddenly realised there was an oppressed minority group that hadn't been included in the mix.This is not the time and the place for a debate about political correctness, because that only leads to platitudes as dull as those in the film. But if the creators had been a little braver, and dared to risk offending just a little, BILB would have been a far, far better movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As good as Beckham (in Euro 2004, that is)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To watch 'Bend It Like Beckham' from the perspective of 2005 is to be reminded of a time when David Beckham was so popular that his name could be used to turn a low budget feature into a surprise hit. It's also to be offered an insight into West London's Asian community, by no means necessarily poor (or even, in some areas, a minority), and substantially British-born, but still highly culturally distinct. This makes the film a contrast to other movies about British immigrant communities such as 'East is East', whose focus is, more traditionally, on a family both poor and outnumbered, although the theme of generational conflict is shared by both. Unfortunately, unlike 'East is East', 'Bend It Like Beckham' fails to deliver much beyond its premise, offering no great insights, mediocre acting and dialogue and the clumsy over-use of both British and Indian popular music on its soundtrack. Moreover, the older generation is depicted unsympathetically, especially the women, while the younger characters are all beautiful and implausibly delicate, given that they are supposed to be members of a women's football team. It's always spritely but there's little on offer here beyond a simple fairy tale: a little more darkness might have added some bite. Beckham's name may have lent this movie his marketability, but in terms of quality, the film reminds one more of Beckham's miserable performances in Euro 2004 than his pomp of a few years earlier. A midfield runner at best.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film was so dull! Before I start, I must say I genuinely wanted to like this film. It is always nice when a smaller British film achieves some level of success worldwide as, let's face it, it's a rare occurrence in recent times.However, this film was decidedly average in every way. To begin with, I watched this on video and that's exactly where this film belongs. There was very little in the look of this film that gave any idea that this was a theatrically released film. Everything about the film screamed TV FEATURE. Aesthetically the cinematography was totally flat and bland, the music was a mix of irritating Brit-pop and slightly better contemporary Asian music. I watched this pan and scan and was surprised that it was originally widescreen, the width didn't seem to have been used - again all very TV.Storywise, it was a pretty stock rags to (possible) riches story. It was interesting to see women's football in the spotlight, particularly concerning an Asian girl. The culture clash aspects were well handled, but at a fairly superficial level. Much of the comedy seemed weak compared to the sharper BBC series "Goodness Gracious Me", although there were a few good moments such as Juliet Stevenson's gaudy mum digging herself ever deeper with racial stereotypes and an old Indian lady who mistakes "lesbian" for "Lebanese". The script and acting were OK for TV-drama fodder but were weak for a theatrical feature. This film certainly doesn't give any indication for Keira Knightley's sudden rise to stardom. Yes she's a good looking girl in a bony, supermodel kind of way but her acting didn't convince me in this film. I also have to add that for a film about football, the actual football scenes were very weak and badly edited. Some action scenes with a bit more excitement and flair would have helped the film.I could continue, but I really can't be bothered. I'm glad it did well for the sake of the British film industry, but I'm also a bit embarrassed. For someone like myself who loves film and cinema I would say avoid the hype and give this film a miss. If you like your TV dramas and soap operas you may well thoroughly enjoy it. My verdict: 5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nothing original, and pretty predictable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Anyone who reads my reviews knows that I can get pretty long-winded at times, but this will probably be my shortest commentary so far. Bend it Like Beckham is not a bad movie. It's acceptably acted, moderately entertaining, and there isn't any one thing that stands out about it as being terrible. But that's my problem with it; it's just average. I gave it a rating of 5, meaning that it isn't bad, but it isn't particularly good either. I found it, simply, average. The film tells the story of a young Indian girl who idolizes soccer star Beckham of the title, and wants to pursue the sport which she's good at. Unfortunately she's bucking the wishes of her traditional, humble family who want no disappointment or ill to come to their daughter. Complicating things is an unnecessary possible love triangle that is flirted with between the main character, her soccer friend, and the coach, and that's pretty much the whole film. I guess I was just disappointed. I kept hearing how great this was, and how unique. I didn't find it unique at all. The movie focused somewhat evenly on her soccer hopes and her family life, but it's the soccer that gets the most glamorized treatment. The family provides mostly cultural jokes and deep discussions of how the daughter isn't upholding their traditions, etc. When the coach offers the young hopeful his support, everyone thinks that they're dating and we have a whole new twenty minutes of complications. And near the end, when a talent scout is discussed, the main character is desperate to get his attention and prove her worth. I hope I'm not spoiling anything, but I'm going to continue and say that nothing happened that I didn't expect. In closing, Bend It isn't a terrible film. However, I didn't really laugh at any of the cultural stuff because I knew that was the main point of it even being in the movie. And I wasn't moved by any sweetness, because anyone could guess that it was coming. The movie sort of dragged on to me like a kind of shallower Karate Kid, but with laughs at the cultural differences instead of the interesting blend of them that I believe Karate Kid achieved. I know that the main message here was to follow your dreams, but I left thinking the movie was just a glamorized soccer film, with the cultural stuff just put in there to keep it from being nothing but.</fullReview>

Grow some balls, stand up to them already and end this! The lesbian references/jokes got tired really quickly. The movie on a whole was just annoying.

As a Marlins fan, I just had to pitch that one in there. `Bend It Like Beckham' is really the film of an Indian lass who dreams of playing professional soccer. However, her strict traditional Indian family forbids it. `Bend It Like Beckham' scored high with audiences and critics alike, and I can see why. The movie is the feel good film of the year. I am not saying that just for kicks. Parminder Nagra held no Indian reservations as Jess our young protagonist, and demonstrated one of the top breakthrough performances of the year. Kiera Knightley of `Pirates of the Caribbean' fame demonstrated another swashbuckling performance in 2004 as Jess' teammate &amp; companion. The movie's sidesplitting &amp; sharp screenplay was like Beckham himself a spicy favorite. I commend Director Gurinder Chadha for her lively direction.

		<fullReview>Spoilers herein.The only interesting thing about this is the appearance of two energetic actresses. One pleasantly mooneyes at the camera and the other has a strong enough presence to have hope (despite "Pirates" and "Phantom") that she might not disappoint like so many others.I knew I was in for a stew of cliches because of Chadha's dreary "What's Cooking" which was a stampede of banality. Here we have female vs. male, gay vs. straight (twice!), modern vs. traditional, Irish vs. English, Sikh vs. British, honor vs. truth, friendship vs. love, family vs. self, all of them from the film-by-numbers playbook.Other than Keira the only thing that is remotely interesting is some of the early footage of the soccer games shot at ankle height -- clearly done by a second crew while the mundane Chadha was elsewhere. And the signature piece: the intercutting of the wedding and the final (show up or your life is ruined) soccer match. Copolla writ small.If you want a simple film with roughly the same theme that at least has energy and imagination, see "Whale Rider" instead. Heck, "Blue Crush" is no less stupid and a whole lot more appealing.Films like this are all about peering and judging. North American audiences like to peer and judge others with a special fondness for the British who willingly present a ridiculous profile, from "Saving Grace" to, well pick almost anything. Here we watch them watching Indians who watch their daughters. Their concern -- seemingly at every level -- is that others will see both them and what they are watching.The only value we get for our money is to see them all at will.

		<shortDescription>It was okay, but some things really annoyed me.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to give Gurinder Chadha full credit for one thing: she was able to bring a huge amount of Indian culture to the international forefront with "Bend It Like Beckham". Not only did she create a movie that was funny, but she also brought a message to Hollywood: Indians are just as good at making good movies.However, unlike many other film fanatics, I must say I didn't really like this movie. As a Sikh girl, I must say that this movie succeeded in creating even MORE stereotypes about Punjabi families and their values. There are many ignorant people in this world, that have the idea that most Indian families are like the family shown in this film. This isn't true. Yes, Ms.Chadha did address some stereotypes about Indians and proved that they weren't true, but she also helped in creating several others.For example, a couple months ago, a fellow student came up to me and asked me "So you don't wear shorts because it's against your culture, right?". Well that kind of annoyed me, because me not wearing shorts had nothing to do with my beliefs or my family. I don't wear shorts because I think they make my thighs look fat. However silly my reason might be, it is a reason altogether. This is just one example of a stereotype that was promoted by "Bend It Like Beckham".Gurinder Chadha failed to show that not all Indian families are like the one she depicted in her film. Not all Indian families have village accents, are suspicious of their children's' every moves, place the most regard on their "status", etc. She failed in letting the general audience know that, although her film is one with a message, it isn't categorizing Indians as one type: strict and weird.The truth is, that yes there are some families like the one in this movie, but most others are just as "normal" as any other family. A Sikh family, like any other family, provides endless love and care for their children. So enough with the stupid and weak jokes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Didn't get too much of a kick out of it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember "Bend It Like Beckham" getting a lot of positive press and word of mouth when it came out, but having finally caught it some eight years later I must admit I wasn't really all that impressed. The story - - of a girl who wants to play soccer/football and find against her family's wishes -- is in its outlines as old as the stars, and this iteration doesn't really add anything to it. On the contrary, it spreads it rather thin across the running time of the film, so that we grow impatient waiting for events that we know from experience will happen to occur. Our protagonist is of Indian extraction and the film makes this a point to focus on. There are conscious allusions to Bollywood cinema, but rather than engaging with the tropes of that industry "Bend it Like Beckham" seems simply to repeat some of them somewhat unimaginatively. Worse, Jess comes packaged with rather shallowly stereotyped Indian parents, whose decision to change their minds at the end is pretty unsurprising. Some actors here are better than others. Keira Knightley and Anupam Kher are quite decent, but nobody is especially excellent. In fact, a lot of the acting -- especially that of Jonathan Rhys Meyers as Joe -- seems to come from the school of thought that holds that if you mumble your lines as sullenly and casually as possible, they will sound realistic. Instead, it only leads to a number of irritating, phoned-in performances. The film is full of montages, often showing practices or travel scenes and always set to music. They seem to me more than anything like mini- music videos unceremoniously dropped into the movie, contributing nothing but an attempt to look cool, and slowing down the proceedings. While the main girl characters of Jules and Jess eventually tiff over their mutual affection, one can't help feeling there are a number of missed opportunities for drama -- had the romance been taken farther before the very end, had Jess confronted her parents rather than lie to them, &amp;c. There are a few funny moments here, but the overall sense I got was of a film that was a little too artificial in its attempts to be inspiring.</fullReview>

The English is a little too fast, not very clear and easy, but good for learning to understand contemporary British speech. For a conservative society, there's a very slightly embarrassing scene of undress, and one of drunkenness with a kiss. My rural students probably won't catch the references to homosexuality. However it is in fact teaching insubordination... It's a good movie, esp after students have had enough exposure to westerners to be able to put it in perspective.I found the script on Drew's Scriptorama, so you could prepare some materials to go along with teaching.</fullReview>

This was Keira Knightly's break out performance (at least until the Pirate trilogy). Much of the humor in the film stems from cross-cultural misunderstandings. There's a big Punjabi wedding towards the end intertwined with a soccer match. Interestingly, the soccer isn't shown enough, probably to mask the lead players' inability to play!

		<shortDescription>An Enjoyable Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay, lets state the obvious, this is not an art movie.However, I enjoyed it, and I think it is well developed. The movie is known internationally but was written for a British audience.So, for the benefit of non-UK audiences, and perhaps younger UK audiences, it should be put into context.Parminder's father makes reference to coming from Nairobi, Kenya and is thus presumed to be a middle class Indian who has come to the UK and has got stuck in a lowly paid job at Heathrow airport. He is not directly from India. (note that the director, Gurinder Chadha, is also an Indian Sikh from Kenya).A bit of history here. Following the contraction of the British Empire after WW2, Kenya (a part of British East Africa) gained independence from Britain, and subsequently kicked out the Indian middle class in the late 1960s/early 1970s. Some found political sanctuary in the UK where they still experienced racism and bigotry. However, there was and is, a strong Indian community in the outer Western suburbs of London which is where this film is set, which is also close to Heathrow airport (hence all the low-flying planes).So, the mother and father are political migrants who came from a country where their culture was important to them, and where they are presumed to have been relatively wealthy but are not so wealthy now.The culture clash is a fairly simple plot, and appears in many movies so I wouldn't patronise anyone explaining this.Later in the movie, we see a sumptuous wedding scene which featured a fair amount of Bhangra music (look it up on Wikipedia) which is, in this movie, a fusion of Punjabi traditional music with more contemporary Western musical instruments ,which is why it is to toe-tappingly good! This is another example of the fusion of the cultures in this movie.I really enjoy this movie when I see it. The characters are well developed, and although often bigoted, none of them are idiots. They may hold strong views, but they can't be hated for this. I think the best character was Jules' mother who got some of the best lines in the movie. And as been pointed out by others, it is refreshing to see that none of the males in the movie were presented as imbecilic morons just to make a cheap point. Okay, some of Jess's male football playing friends in the park were a bit dim, but none more so that Pinky's female friends.Keira Knightly's performance was a bit wooden, but at least she keeps male viewer's attention! All in all, I love this movie. The music was perfect, and the actors well chosen and they played their characters well. The plot is a bit cheesy, but it is carried off well, for what it is."Laters" :-)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>O_O...wow...what a great movie.Perfect. Seamless. A Jewel.The girls are lovely. The soccer is fast and exciting. The families are real and human. The music is excellent and fits the movie like a glove.- Now I'll Plug In My Societal Commentary - I have this to say though. It is vitally important that EVERYONE feels special. Our current society is one of "hero worship", of "celebrity worship", of people filling the void in their own lives resulting from unrealized and unfulfilled dreams with the vicarious living through of famous others. This is not healthy."It is impossible to truly celebrate the success of others, if one cannot truly celebrate their own."I am happy for the beautiful success of the 2 girls, but, it is difficult to not feel some pangs of jealousy stabbing my soul. I have not fulfilled my own dreams.I know. I know. It's my problem. My fault. If I want something I have to go out there and "fight. fight. fight." ...well...fighting's great. if you love being in a constant state of war. i do not.I want peace and joy in my heart, not the constant strain of feeling I am always at war with someone.Solution? Simple. As a people we have to always encourage one another to be fully ourselves, to always follow "our" dreams, and to trust that we are all kind, generous, wonderful human beings, who just want to be happy and make others happy (search your heart. deep down this is true).It's a matter of trust, and faith in each other.Keira Knightley is an impressive actress. I can see the fire in her eyes. It's beautiful.But...I will never truly be able to appreciate it, until I feel that I am fulfilling my own dreams. I don't think anyone can truly appreciate Keira, until they feel they are also on top of the world as she is, enjoying incredible success in their own lives.And...there's no need to fight to get there. Just being who one is 100% will carry one to the tops of the highest mountains they can envision."If you feel supported and loved, you will love and support others."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you want to see a film about footballing females, forget Gregory's Girl this film is far better. It's a feel good film about contemporary people and is in the same league as Brassed Off, The Full Monty and Billy Elliot. Like these films, had it been made in the 1970s or early 80s it would probably have been made for the small screen as part of BBC's Play for Today and it would not have been as upbeat. It is socially relevant as it shows the tensions that can arise between young Asians in Britain and their conservative minded parents. The opening fantasy sequence which shows Jess's mother being interviewed by Gary Lineker and him saying she must be very proud of her daughter and then she tells him in no uncertain terms of her disapproval of her daughter playing football is very good. The performances all round are great. Keira Knightley was still a rising star when this was made. It's funny the way there is a misunderstanding which leads to Jules' mother's unjustified fears of her daughter being a lesbian are seemingly confirmed. Keira has a slightly boyish appearance which is an asset when it comes to infiltrating pirate ships but leads to another misunderstanding when Jess's sister's fiancé's parents see her and Jess having a matey hug and kiss. Juliet Stevenson gives a great performance as Jules's mother who definitely has a little bit of Hyancinth Bucket in her. Look at the way she dresses for the football match as if she's going to Royal Ascot. Despite various setbacks all ends satisfactorily. The closing shot is very good showing Jess's father playing cricket after he has mentioned a couple of times in the film how he had to leave a cricket club years before because of racism. I am a bit of an aircraft buff and watching the film I was surprised to see that the team were coming off a Boeing 707, an airliner that has been obsolete for a good many years now. The trivia section here confirmed that it was indeed a 707. But that doesn't detract from a great movie, one of the best British films of the early 21st Century.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Touching and inspiring....once you learn to block out the blaring soundtrack</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really, really liked this film a lot. It was a small little British film that somehow struck a chord and became an international hit. And I could certainly understand why, as although the story is very old fashioned (mirroring themes in films such as THE JAZZ SINGER, EAT DRINK MAN WOMAN and Hollywood/BOLLYWOOD), the characters and style of the film made the whole experience come alive. With such a simple story, the director and writers did a great job of making the audience care about the characters--sucking you into the experience and touching your heart.Unfortunately, the film also was initially a chore to watch, as I absolutely hated the soundtrack and almost turned the film off soon after it began because it was so darn loud and distracting. I really can't think of another film where the music level was so loud. Plus, if you don't like the Euro-beat, it really became annoying. Fortunately, I was able to tune it out but I wonder if viewers even older than me might feel even more disenchanted with the music, whereas younger folk probably will not be put off by it. I like loud music (hey, Heavy Metal and Hair Band music is great), but not when it takes center stage with a film that required a little bit more subtlety.By the way, check out BOLLYWOOD/Hollywood. It's very similar to this film but is actually a better film showing the Indian experience in Canada. The family is Hindu (not Seikhs) but is very similar to BEND IT LIKE BECKHAM.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie "Bend it like Beckham" do not impress me. Because of the weak story and the inexperienced actors it is very prospective and the plot gets boring. The mixture of some soccer scenes and a little brawl between two girls is really ridiculous. The only way to keep this movie alive is to tell about the disparities between the English and the Indian culture. Because of the old tradition to arrange the marriage of an own daughter you see in this movie the change. So the children get more freedom and respect in this society.Overall this movie are not really a hit so it depends on the viewer and on his/her expectations and preferences towards movies.I would not promote this film.khm2</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not good at all. It sucks.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, this is a girls movie. It should appeal to adolescent girls more than any others. I really don't see any reason for any one else to like this movie. Perhaps there are more girls that like soccer than I'm aware of. I don't know.The popularity of this movie is inexplicable. Seems like the Indian people really hyped it up for seeing such a venture for the first time. But even I, an American, can see the obvious - that the director has pretty much sold out her culture and homeland for a monetary profit. Thats right. This movie is filled with stereotypes and clichés about Indian immigrants in Britain. Thats how it goes forward, by purely exploiting and amplifying embarrassing stereotypes about Indians. If I were an Indian, I would have disowned this movie and the director.Not only that but this movie also depicts some Britishers as totally ignorant of other cultures. The jokes are stupid and unoriginal. The screenplay is not that bad though. The story is also unoriginal and predictable. This movie is not worth your time and money.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If only Kiera Knightley could be edited out of this film, it would have been perfect! I don't even know what Gurinder Chadha was thinking casting her.Anyways, the film is about the melting pot life of NRI's living in England. The main plot follows the life of Jess (Parminder Nagra) a young Punjabi girl who dreams of being an excellent football player like David Beckham but her family has other plans for her. They want her to groom herself properly in order to become a worthy bride like her older sister is about to be. Jess defies her family by going to secretly play ball for a local football team that consists of Kiera Knightley (who becomes her rival as well as her friend), All Saints singer Shaznay Lewis and Johnathan Rhys Myers as the team's coach. The ever funny Anupam Kher and Archie Panjabi co-star as Jess's hilarious parents.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The story in short</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A young Indian girl (Jess) simply loves football. She plays football in the park all day long. One day a blonde girl (jules) comes along and says she's been watching her play. She invites her to come to a training of the local lady's team. A few days later Jess has her first training. The coach (Joe) immediately sees that Jess has great potential of becoming a professional football player in the future. Jess trains every week. However her parents do not know this until one day she is forced to tell them. Jess' mother disagrees on her daughter being part of a football team and says she has to learn how to cook Indian meals, so as to prepare for being a good housewife, like all the other Indian girls do. Her father concurs. Jess misses two trainings because she has to learn how to cook. Joe wonders why she's been missing and decides to drop by Jess' house to talk to see what's going on. He tries to make them see that Jess has great potential, but Jess' parents just won't listen. Her father says that in his home country he was a professional cricket player but when he came to England and wanted to join the local cricket team, he got laughed at. Even though her parents tell her not to, Jess continues to sneak out to train with the other girls. One day her sister betrays her and says she's been playing football ever since her parents told her to stop. Her parents make sure Jess doesn't go to training anymore by watching her all day long. One day Jules comes along and tells her the team is going to Germany for a three-day tournament and that there will be some American scouts looking for talent. Immediately Jess starts brainstorming on ways she could tell her parents she really wants to go to Germany. In the end she lies saying she's going to stay with one of her aunts. She calls her mother, from the hotel, each day. But then when her father tries to call them, he finds out that she is not staying with her aunt and he knows that she must be playing football somewhere. Meanwhile the girls are doing great in Germany. After one of the matches Joe goes to Jess for a talk and they end up kissing each other. Jules sees this and is very disappointed in both Jess and Joe. She fancied Joe from the beginning and Jess knew this. The girls are both very angry with each other. When the team returns at the football club Jess' family is waiting for her there. They don't say a word but everybody knows what's going on. Jess' father beckons her to come. At home the daily life continues, Jess has to learn how to be a proper housewife. One day her sisters pronounces she's going to get married on the 19th. Everyone is happy except for Jess. The league final is on the 19th! Even though Joe comes around a second time to convince her parents to let her play, because this time there will be sponsors and they'll be there to watch Jules and Jess play, cause they think they've seen some talent in Germany, Jess her father and mother just say no and that's all. Jess knows this time it won't be possible to sneak away or tell a fancy lie and therefore she accepts the situation. During the wedding party she walks around with a long face, which her father notices. When she goes to the toilet her cousin runs to her and grabs her arm. He says that this is her chance, he could drive her to the field and she could play in the second half of the match. She says she won't do this, she wants to stop sneaking out and wants to stop telling lies; she even says she thinks her sisters wedding is more important than football. Then her father comes to her and says she should go and play, he says that the team needs her and he knows this because he's been to one of her matches without his wife knowing this! Jess and her cousin drive away instantly and Jess changes in the car on the way. When she arrives the team is one down and they have half an hour left to play. She comes in as a substitute and after 15 minutes passes very neatly to Jules and she scores. Then in the last minute of the match Jess is fouled and she gets a free kick. 16 meters, a wall of six, one chance. She focuses and then bends it into the upper left corner with a fantastic kick. After the match Jules and Jess are both very excited and decide to forget about the argument. Jess goes back to her sisters wedding hastily. A few days later she hears that she and Jules can both get an American scholarship and join in an American college football team. She doesn't know how to tell her parents about this. This time she decides to tell the truth. She tells them about the scholarship in and says that it's her dream come true. Still her mother says she won't allow it and looks towards her husband. He stands up, looks at his wife and then at his daughter and he starts a speech saying: "I once got the opportunity to be a great cricket player, but I turned it down because of our cultures principals and I haven't been myself ever since. I don't want this to happen to my daughter as well. I just want both of my daughters to be happy." And finally his wife agrees. A week or so later they say goodbye to everyone, including Joe. And then Jules and Jess both leave for America.I give this movie an eight, because I like the story and because some parts are just so hilarious.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very nice comedy, but probably not for the mainstream (European male) audience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've always been very reluctant to watch this movie and there were several reasons for that. First of all, despite the fact that I'm just like the average European young male, I'm far from a soccer fan. It's just not my kind of sports, I prefer car racing. The second reason was the title. Of course I've heard of Beckham before, but despite what all other people think of him, I can only see him as a rather arrogant, often stupid looking guy who happens to be a little bit better in kicking against a black and white leather ball. Nothing special, so why should I want to see a movie that carries his name? Well, now that I've finally seen it, I know why and I also know that it is a shame that I didn't watch it sooner.This movie tells the story of two young girls that love to play soccer and that have to fight against a lot of prejudices in order to do what they like. Both girls are preparing themselves for one of the most important matches in their lives, hoping to get a transfer to an important American club, at least when they get the opportunity to play. One girl is from Indian origin, of the Sikh faith. Her family has been living in Britain for several years already, but they are very conservative and still very fond of their own traditions. They want their daughters to get married to a good Indian boy, want to see them walk around in traditional clothes and want them to learn how to cook traditional Indian food. When Pinky, one of their daughters, is preparing herself for marriage, but Jessminder, the other daughter, only has soccer on her mind, they feel very uncomfortable with this 'embarassing' situation. The other girl is a white girl. Her dad doesn't mind that she plays soccer, already happy that she isn't bringing one boy after the other home, but her mom is convinced that her daughter is a lesbian. What other girl likes to play football, rather than to go out with her mother to go shopping for clothes? When you are looking for some very dramatic scenes or a very deep story, than this isn't the movie you should go for. But when you want to have some lighter, but nevertheless very decent entertainment, than this is perhaps THE comedy that you should give a try. Depsite all my prejudices, I admit that I really had a very good time watching this movie. This could easily have become very preachy, telling us how hard life can be when you don't fit in, when you try to be different in the pursuit of your dreams,... I guess that, if this had been a Hollywood production, it would have become some kind of syrupy TV-movie. But the makers of this movie have done a good job, avoiding that obvious trap. The acting in this movie is very good as well. Before this movie I only knew Jonathan Rhys-Meyers, Trey Farley and Keira Knightley. And they all did a nice job. But they weren't the only ones. The Indian actors were all very interesting and good as well. Big was also my surprise when I saw the amount of movies Anupam Kher has played a role in (222 at this moment). I don't know if this is exactly the kind of movie the average (European) soccer fan wants to see. I know that for instance my brother doesn't like it a bit. He's a real soccer fan and he still sees it as a game for men, rather than one that can be played by women as well. And he's probably not the only one with that opinion, so I doubt if it will appeal to that kind of people. However, when you are interested in the habits and traditions of foreign cultures, if you want to have a good laugh and don't mind the fact that this isn't exactly the most profound of all stories, than this is a movie you shouldn't miss. I certainly had a very good time with it and that's why I give it a 7.5/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It must be 1969...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Bend it Like Beckham" (2002:) A girl knows her place. A girl learns to cook, stays in the kitchen, and marries who is chosen for her. She doesn't play sports. She doesn't assert herself. She doesn't date boys out of her race, doesn't show any skin, doesn't disobey, doesn't wear makeup, doesn't have a friend who is homosexual, doesn't leave the country, doesn't doesn't doesn't...and yet, this East Indian/English film takes ON ALL these (and many more) tired, clichéd, worn-thin issues as though it was now 1969 and Mary Tyler Moore decided to do an After School Special for teen girls. The acting is weak, the musical score suited to the worst of 70's tee-vee, the lighting is awful, the dialog - well, think "All in the Indian-English Family" (but without any wit or humor). The story is pure pre-"Flash Dance". "Dirty Dancing" with soccer. The photography is straight from the 1970 text book on grade B films, I lost count of the predictable moments, you can guess the ending within the first five minutes of this movie, and the only reason I stuck with it was KNOWING I'd have fun writing this. And I have. Thanks.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Goal! But not an hattrick...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Bend It Like Beckham" is a movie that puts the ball in the net with several moments but also misses the post on others. Yet the good elements of the movie make up for the bad ones, which make this movie a good one and a pleasure to watch.I've always been charmed with Keira Knightley's looks but she never really quite charmed me with her acting abilities in the movies I've seen her in ("Pirates of the Caribbean", "Love Actually"). Yet she pleasantly surprised me in this movie and I think it's fair to say that this is her best role till date. The rest of the cast is also good but it really was Keira Knightley that impressed me. I will certainly watch her future career with great interestThe story is quite formulaic and gets predictable at times. The whole race/culture issue is handled better in movies like "East is East". Still the story remains charming and sweet to watch, which is I think due to the acting, dialogs, humor and the easy atmosphere.It's funny, it's a sport movie but the worst scene's were in my opinion the football matches. The way it was edited was poorly, you couldn't understand what was happening on the field and all of the goals were so obviously staged that it was laughable at times. All of the football scene's were highly unbelievable and as a viewer you can never understand why Jess and Jules were regarded as big talents. Seriously, I've seen girls in real life doing way more amazing things with a ball (no pun intended). Oh and I can assure you that no football team in the world has so many pretty girls on one team but that's hardly a complain of course, because it's always a pleasure to watch Keira Knigthley and a bunch of other girls in a dressing room but it's just that it didn't made the movie really more believable.But still "Bend It Like Beckham" is incredibly good to watch and kind of is a 'feel good movie'. Just pure entertainment that also tries to give a message. It doesn't always work successfully and not all things are handled in the best way but it still is a good and charming movie.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Perfectly OK comedy/drama about two girls playing soccer despite less than inspiring parents. One of them comes from an Indian family that wants her to choose a more traditional lifestyle, which causes problems.This isn't really my favourite kind of film, but it still managed to be entertaining. There's not exactly anything new plot-wise, but it's done without taking itself too seriously, so it still works. The acting is fine all-round, but I think that Nagra shines and manages to be very believable despite being quite a bit older than her character.One thing puzzles me, though - why are the male leads/hunks in this kind of films always so damn boring? I'm sure that many women find Rhys-Meyers good looking and all, but he's got the charisma of a dish rag. Strange...Anyway, not much else to say about the film: looks good (although the actual soccer footage leaves a lot to be desired), and the music was adequately catchy. All in all, nothing revolutionary, but still solid entertainment. [6/10]</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The last couple of years there has only been one successful formula for British movies:The underdog who survives triumphantly even though there are many obstacles on the way. Some of the typical events are: - hostile environment, here religion and culture; - misunderstandings, often a crisis with their best friend, supporter; - a relative who actually understands the problems of the main character; - an ending where all problems melt away; - a soundtrack of some oldies which accompanies the filler scenes, here the football practice action; etc, etcOther examples of this movie category are Billy Elliott, Full Monty, Brassed Off.They usually pass the time but afterwards one feels ripped off as the formula is so utterly predictable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not bad for a 'feel-good' movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Bend it Like Beckham', written and directed by Gurinder Chadha is about as basic as it gets in terms of plot. Jess, (Parminder Nagra) an Indian girl living in England is an excellent soccer player, but her traditional family values will not allow her to participate, so she sneaks out and does anything she can to play on a local soccer team at the behest of her new friend Julies (Keira Knightley), a soccer goddess in her own right who has a supportive father, but a mother who does not share her enthusiasm for the sport. The film explores the similarities and differences between two cultures and the girls' common goal ? to play soccer professionally.There were no surprises in 'Bend it Like Beckham', everything happened how I expected it would within the first five minutes of the film, but the manner in which these things occurred was refreshingly not banal. The two main actresses were basically novices when this film was made, and they exhibited a natural talent. Nothing stands out as fantastic or horrible in 'Bend It Like Beckham', it is just a basic feel-good movie that for some reason, probably timing, was a smash hit around the world. It is a fairly entertaining film, but not rocket science, so if you are looking for a film that you can just kind of stare at and not have to think about any deeper meaning, but not have your intelligence mocked or your time wasted, 'Bend it Like Beckham' is your movie.--Shelly</fullReview>

The whole young adult child seeks freedom to go against old-fashioned traditional values of family plot has been done plenty of times before, and quite frankly has been done better. In this case, the story centers around Jess(Parminder Nagra), an Indian girl living in England who dreams of playing soccer professionally. Her parents however, won't have it, wanting her to marry an Indian boy and learn how to cook. Really no surprises in the plot, this movie is average in every way. The one thing that raises my rating to a six is the well-filmed soccer scenes and a few funny moments. For instance, the mother of Jules(Kiera Knightley) trying to deter her daughter from playing soccer: "There's a reason why Sporty Spice is the only one without a man."</fullReview>

Because I believe that a man as talented as Jon is needs roles that will show off talent. This film was quite big compared to all his other small British flicks, so do you think that now that he's well known will his performances go downhill? Will he become just a subdued main character's friend? Hopefully not, but you never know. Fame seems to do something to people, but lets hope not Jon.

		<fullReview>The foreign films I choose to see are rare and I'm not sure why I decided to see this one. Maybe because the previews I saw made me think this film would be funny. It had some cute dialogue but generally this was a generic plot. Foreign films usually have a certain panache. They are different from American films sometimes in big ways and sometimes in small ways. This film looked and acted like a mediocre American film. Every American issue was highlighted in this movie: gayness, sports vs femininity, generational differences, tradition vs change, race vs race (although I thought sociologists have already proven there is no such thing as race), stupid mothers and wise fathers... I think the director watched a thousand mediocre American films, compared plot lines, found the most popular plot line, and developed a film with the purpose of gathering an uneducated American audience and thus making money. I'm going to look deeper into foreign films from now on.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My Big Fat Sikh Wedding</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are many similarities between "Bend It Like Beckham" and "My Big Fat Greek Wedding" in that both deal with the collision between ethnic groups and the assimilation of immigrants' children into the society into which they have relocated themselves. The story and humor of "Bend It" are quite superior, however, to the contrived, and often cheap laughs of "Greek Wedding"; it is the story of a teenage Sikh girl (the people of the Punjab region of Northwest India, known for wearing turbans and beards, and for their very strong work ethic) who is growing up in London, and is caught between the old world view of her immigrant parents, and the realities of modern life in England. Like "Monsoon Wedding", "Bend It" offers an interesting glimpse into the world of Indian society and customs. Like "About a Boy" and various other Hugh Grant films, the movie also shows middle class life on the other side of the pond, which is also quite interesting. This Sikh family lives comfortably in the London suburbs with a father who is apparently an airline pilot. While the parents live and function as members of English society, they also, understandably, adhere more closely to the customs of their culture than their daughters and others of the next generation who are typical English teenagers, but also lead a double life at home, and within the Indian immigrant community. The main character of the film, Jasminder (Jas), is interested more in playing soccer than in learning traditional Punjabi cooking technique, and idolizes the famous English soccer player David Beckham (the Shaquille O'Neal and Bobby Bonds of England combined). When her soccer abilities bring her into membership on a local girls' team, the conflict is set up with her desire to play (and she is quite good) and her parents' desire for her to pursue serious studies at college, and set about finding a proper (Punjabi Sikh) husband- like her sister. Making the story more poignant is the experience of Jas's father, who as a young immigrant with great promise as a cricket player was cruelly discriminated against by the English cricket clubs he sought to join. Though the movie follows basic formulas that most people will be able to recognize, the setting and details are compelling enough to keep the tale fresh, even if you can predict who will show up to help win the "big game". "Bend It" is a very refreshing amalgamation of several motifs; the "sports movie", the "star-crossed lovers" tale and the "goofy old-fashioned parents" genre, to name three, but yet surmounts each of these potentially banal conventions to succeed mightily as an entertaining, interesting, and- dare I say it- inspiring story. Don't bend- go straight to the theater to see it.</fullReview>

However it merely succeeds in being a cliched romantic comedy which wastes interesting ideas like a striker with Tolblerone for boots.Jess is an 18-year old whose elder sister is getting married and whose parents want her to be doing likewise as soon as possible. However she is far more interested in playing football like her idol David Beckham (who can bend a ball well, as we are reminded no less than 10 times in the movie!) than learning how to cook Aloo Chat and become the perfect wife. Against her parents wishes she joins a local girls football team and numerous plot contrivances (and there is no other fitting way to describe them) lead to misery for all involved until the cop-out climax.Gurinder Chadra's film is not without it's redeeming features. The performances are solid and likeable with only Juliet Stevenson's image obsessed housewife seeming a little too much like it was fashioned from the back of a corn flakes packet for comfort. Jess's adolescent dreaming and view of life are also neatly captured at points, especially in the opening sequence where she fantasies about scoring the winner for Man United and having pundits heaping praise upon her, only for her Mother to invade her daydream and chastise Gary Lineker and company for encouraging her.Unfortunately such light hearted playfulness is rare in what is a depressing sombre film, with writer-director-producer Chadra either unable to produce consistent comedy or deciding that there are more worthy causes to focus on. However there are simply too many ideas and too little depth given to the deeper issues of the film, with Jess trying to balance both English and Indian cultures and her and her parents hopes, and after a while you wonder if the film was adapted from the contents page of a book on the trials of being an Indian teenager.The films plot, which seems like it has the words `and then...' written in capital letters every five pages of the screen play, seems to rejoice in coincidence. No sooner does one situation start developing, such as the token relationship between Jess and her coach, than the viewer is thrown a twist that lands half the protagonists in a cliff-hanger. This approach would be understandable if the film were being shown as ten minute segments on TV with the Hollyoaks theme being regularly played, but appears woefully childish on the big screen.Lacking the emotional resonance of films such as East Is East, Bend it Like Beckham is an opportunistic piece of cinema that cashes in on a big star name who doesn't even appear, almost in the style of Bowfinger. I spent most of the time wondering who the player who kept getting dropped whenever Jess could play was, and how she felt about her disposable nature. She could be seen briefly at one point, but like most interesting things in the film, disappeared within seconds.5/10David Goody</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You like football and you are interested in this movie? Then I have to disappoint you? This story of an Indian teenager girl, named Jessminder Bhamra, is based on the culture clash of India and Great Britain. The football shows up the disparities between Indian tradition and modern British life. That sounds interesting, but the whole implementation seems to be very wishy-washy. Everything which has to do with Indian culture creates a cliché atmosphere and seems to be exaggerated. The main actors Parminder Nagra (Jessminder), Keira Knightley (Jules, Jessminder's best friend) and Jonathan Rhys Meyers (Joe, the coach) made a good job and fit very well to their roles. Nevertheless, the talent of the young actors is clouded by unrealistic football scenes. Also the love story between Joe and Jessminder is so senseless for the plot that you can go meanwhile to the freezer and get a new drink, without missing something important. The climax of absurdity is still the mother of Jessminder's best friend Jules. Only because her daughter plays football and hugs other girls she thinks Jules is lesbian. I think if they would cut every scene of her, nobody would notice it. Of course nobody could forecast the happy ending of the movie. Jessminder wins her last football match at her sister's wedding day, gets a free scholarship on an American college and finally her parents accept their daughter's passion. Result: This movie is neither comedy, nor sports movie. And if you are interested in culture you can read 5 minutes in Wikipedia and you get more information than watching this UK-supported Bollywood trash.Henning Schultz</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I so looked forward to seeing this film. Everyone I know loved it. It was billed as a ?teenage coming of age' film?'liberating', inspiring' ?uplifting' etc. I was extremely letdown. The performances are mediocre, at best. Lies and deception win out over traditional family and cultural values. The central character herself (Jess) is not even likeable. She is raised by her parents with loving but strict, core family/cultural values yet ultimately succumbs to drinking, club-dancing, sneaking out behind her parents backs, lying, and deceiving both her parents and her best friend. Is this really what ?coming of age' is about? Is this was truly will bring happiness? Is this virtuous? The film's mantra that parents ?don't always know what's best for you, that you have to live your own life', etc., is repeated so often that it becomes tiresome, and overwhelms any positive appreciation for core-family values and the traditional values revered by the central character's culture and many cultures throughout the world. Jess finally winds up stealing the young man who her VERY best friend is in love with in a romantic twist that is lacking credibility. And, all this after begging her best friend and college roommate-to be for forgiveness. In short, the 'heroine' has lost all her virtuous traditional family values. I'm at a loss as to why this film was so popular except that some may find 'liberation' from traditional values a 'good thing'. The film left me with a sick feeling in the pit of my stomach.</fullReview>

It's not great, but director Gurinder Chada, whose work I have admired, keeps things going at a nice pace.Perhaps the best reason for seeing this film is Parminder Nagra, who makes her character, Jes, something we can identify with. Also in the cast Keira Knightley and Jonathan Rhys-Meyers, as well as Juliet Stevenson who is a lot of fun in whatever film she's in.All in all, a fun time at the cinema, even though you don't understand a thing about football.</fullReview>

The whole time I would watch the actors I couldn't get past that they look like they are acting (I know that they ARE acting, but if the viewer can't look past the fact that they are acting and forget that you're watching a movie, then the acting is bad). There is little to no redeeming value of this movie, but there are few positives though: Keira Knightley is hot and on-screen a lot; gratuitous shots of incredible looking Indian cuisine and of soccer girls working out; "hanging" out scenes in cool-looking European cities. That's about it. Don't go see this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Bend it Like Beckham" received good marks from critics and public alike. So, color me stoopid but I just didn't get it. The film played out like a long string of sitcom quality scenes sprinkled with Kodak moments, trailer moments, and Rocky moments in a busy format of criss-crossing plots with obvious ploys at every turn. A Brit-Bollywood combo built around football with the usual generation gap, culture clashing, etc. was quite simply boring with nothing new, stiff performances by the young protags, and eminently predictable throughout. However, I'm almost certainly in the minority here, so take these comments for whatever they're worth which probably isn't much. Enjoy! (C+)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First off, this movie is for girls ONLY, girl who think soccer is great, love happens the cute way &amp; indian culture is something precious only to be thrown out at the end in 2 minutes. Let me get that in details, without the Beckham image this movie would be the biggest flop ever, thus going into the famous ManU star the movie actually gets attention. The football scenes are really bad, staged of course and the camera focuses on the ball so as for directing I'm going to give it the worst mark for sure. Then the love conflict are dating back from the 1980s british dating, getting annoyed at another girl so immature shows the screenplay was writted on a a beercoaster with ripped off corners. Every teen girl is going to love this but everybody else will be feeling cheated at the story. Then the culture has always been a talked about issue, arranged marriages, inner culture marriages etc...nothing new and then as a stupid twist in the story the whole issue is forgotten for the sake of a happy ending...stupid stupid stupid...'nuff said!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Guirinder Chandha's number is the first of its kind. She tackled the issues of ethnicity, gender roles, football, and coming-of-age in a 90-minute movie. This is also where the problem starts, however.With only 90 minutes to boot, Chandha only caressed each of the four heavy-hitting topics. The issues were shallow, and the jokes were consequently very pragmatic and repetitive. They were funny because the audience already knew the punch-line and they knew when to laugh.The characters, aside from Jesminder (her performance is excellent in this film), are one-dimensional and stereotypical. (A suburban mother concerned with her daughter's femininity, a gay "best friend", and a Prince Charming who fancies "dark" meat ... pla-eese).The bottom line: How many clichés can you cram in a 90-minute movie?

		<shortDescription>Very enjoyable, even with its problems</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am not into sports films as much as others, but I have enjoyed a fair few- Mean Machine, The Longest Yard(original), Hoosiers, Remember the Titans and this film. The footballing storyline can get predictable, such as the nail-biting finish resting on a penalty kick, and some of the romance is rather fluffy. However, there is much to praise about Bend it Like Beckham. It does have an opportunistic title, which is interesting in itself, while the concept is original and has the flavour of East is East in a way. The script does have its comical and heart-warming moments, and there are a lot of them, the pace is efficient, the direction is solid and the football is great to watch. I also liked how Bend it like Beckham was filmed, and the soundtrack which was exhilarating and drove the film even more. And the acting in general is very good, Parminder Nagra puts a lot of spirit into her title character and shows a considerable amount of skill as an actress and as a footballer, while Kiera Knightley is decent enough. My favourite though was Juliet Stevenson, who was a sheer delight as a Hounslow mum. Overall, very enjoyable and recommended. 8/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ok, I saw this film under the wrongful impression one gets from the trailer and other publicity.The minute the critics start raving about a film one should suspect something fishy is going on ... and I usally do but most the audience are as unreliable as the afore mentioned.Like the ever dull and not less metally challenged Owen Gleiberman [Entretainment Weekly] saying " If I had a dime for every time someone asked me how I could have hated 'My big fat greek wedding', I think I'd gather up the money, rent out a theater, and invite all of them to see 'Bend it like Beckham'. "Why? To torture them?If there is something good about this film , it has to be Jonathan Rhys Meyers [the lead male character and love interest to the protagonist] ... he is by no means a talented actor nor reason enough to watch this film but he is very handsome and stupidly charming as such.Anyone who has seen "The magnificent Ambersons" can confirm this. The story is a cliche but none the less it had reasonable potential to be a good light hearted comedy ... a feel good movie.It never had potential to be realistic on any level, serious, or deep ... for these qualities are reserved for truly talented people [directors, actors, writers, etc].Now, if you are a silly person be sure you'll enjoy it ... but if you are that other kind of viewer used to a tad of higher thinking I have no doubt you will be dissapointed.Unfortunately for us the director and writer are very extreme people [they'd do better working in theater] ... they are either extremely serious or extremely silly soap opera like.The film ridicules everyone except who ever is not there, the story is a joke with too much music and not enough content.I don't feel like going into the particulars of the so called story line, it bores me to death but I do hope that whoever watched the film after reading my review [that of a true film buff / filmmaker] suffers and pays well for it ... which they will.Before leaving though, I should say that the "resolution" of the relationship between Jonathan &amp; the she-footballer [soccer player here in the US] was almost good / credible until of course it's ruined by the "real resolution" at the very end of the film which takes place at the airport.You'll know what I'm talking about soon enough.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As usual yet another grin a little, slightly feel good film from the local producers here. The creator of this film is a genius. Use the flavour of the day as a hot title, throw in some ethnic eccentricities and a few flashes of ladies involved in sporting activity and there you have it, a "hit" movie.To be honest the main grins were from the efforts of Shaheen Khan who played the mother of our main actress. There were the few occasional gems from the others. For a movie than was based on the formula mentioned above, there was enough ethnic background but very little soccer involved. Clever editing and camera angles hid the main characters' lack of footie abilities. Truthfully there is actually only one shot of our main actress doing a light curl on a shot at a washing line and that was about it. Rather disappointing when the estimated half that involved football you only get to see a player rush towards the football, swing her feet at it and a sudden shift to a ball entering the goal mouth.Many may argue defensively that this was not a football movie despite the working title, well tough. I can't really sing accolades about this film like the others. I guess I am not easily amused by light slapstick and light everything. Would I recommend this movie to anyone else? Well, when asked I will give a lopsided grin and that's about it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jess Bhamra is a young girl preparing for her exams before University. To her parents disapproval she enjoys playing football in the park with men ? where her skills help her hold her own. When she is invited to train with a local women's team by Jules, she fits in well and her skills blossom. However can she manage to keep it a secret from her parents while still playing like her idol Beckham. Her parents however, want her to be a proper Asian girl and get married like her sister.Unfortunately this film was premiered one day after Beckham broke his foot in the Champions League (Duscher! England will not forget you!) and the media coverage was all about `Break it like Beckham' etc. However the film shone through to reveal a good coming of age story that works well outside of race or sport. Jess wants to do something that her parents don't agree with ? this is true of all teenagers and the film recognises this by focusing not only on Jess, but also the growing pains of white team mate Jules. The story moves well and is funny without being an out and out comedy.The film has problems ? the main one being that it is billed as a comedy but is more of a funny drama. However the main weakness is the story piling on events ? i.e. every time Jess does something you can guarantee that her parents (or someone) will walk round the corner at the wrong moment, this gets tiresome after a while. Also the director is clearly happier with the Asian wedding footage etc than with the football stuff ? hence any football action is either blurred or unrealistic. These are minor complaints though.Although the story gets a bit soapy at times, it remains funny and charming, even with the overly optimistic conclusion. The main cast are delightful and really involved me. Parminder Nagra is really good as Jess ? she is pretty but also funny and vunerable, she really gets the audience behind her. Similarly Knightley is charming and warm as Jules. Rhys-Meyers is sexyily good looking, Juliet Stevenson fits her role perfectly and the Bhamra family all play well ? neither being comedy characters or ogres. The most talented All Saint, Shazney Lewis is barely used, but some funny cameos are punchy ? Gary Lineker, Alan Hanson, John Barnes and John Motson are all funny. Some of the dialogue is terrible and falls flat, but it is to the film's credit that it moves on regardless.I'm not sure how it will fit with other markets ? maybe in Europe it could do OK ? but America doesn't even know what football is, never mind Beckham! Overall though, beyond the football and the Beckham worship, this is a good tale of a girl growing up and finding her own path ? regardless of race or sport. Not earth shattering or hilariously funny, but it is enjoyable none the less.</fullReview>

However, I am a woman over the age of 40, and I am sick and tired of women being portrayed as empty-headed creatures with no life outside of cooking and planning for their daughters' weddings. Even a movie like Monsoon Wedding, which portrayed a traditional Indian wedding, had warmth and feeling for its female characters. But I got the impression that the director and writer hated older women. It just so happens that many, many Indian women have devoted their lives to medicine, government, science, literature, social work. Where were these women in this movie?Besides those particularly insulting stereotypes, there is the flatness of plot, the fact that the film contained no surprises, and the broad and empty characterizations. At least the young people were good looking, but not enough to save the film for me.If I want to see movies about cultures clashes, I'll watch Mississippi Masala, My Beautiful Launderette, etc. There isn't even enough football to make the film interesting.Only for people who thought My Big Fat Greek Wedding was a masterpiece instead of a cliches, two-hour situation comedy.

		<fullReview>The movie "Bend it like Beckham", produced by Gurinder Chadha in 2002, disappointed me! It is in part a very funny and good performance, but just a movie without serious messages and a lot of flaccidity. "Anyone can cook aloo gobi, but who can bend a ball like Beckham?"Jessminder "Jess" Bhamra (Parminder Nagra) is an eighteen year old Sikh girl who lives with her Indian family in London. Her passion of playing football and her dream to become a professional football player clashes with her conservative Indian culture. Jess' parents wants her to be a proper Indian girl, so there are obvious problems when Jess meets Jules (Keira Knightley) ,who invites her to join her woman's football team. They both fall in love with Joe (Jonathan Rhys Meyers) , the coach of the team and it develops another conflict. The other storyline is based on Pinky, Jess' sister, who is going to marry an Indian man very soon. In the end, the conflict of British and Indian culture gets to a climax and ends up with a totally stupid happy ending. Jess wins the most important match of the season while her sister Pinky celebrate her traditional wedding. Everything is alright and her parents even approve to a scholarship for Jess' on an American college. Good actors and some funny situations does let a film not be a good film. There are just too much mistakes on plot and editing. The first disturbing thing is that the whole story is predictable as if you would have seen this all before a thousand times. The culture conflicts are just connected to football to create the impression that this is a new idea. Another great problem is that the whole story is just unrealistic and absurd. There is never ,for example, a point in the movie where you will take the conflict of Jess and her parents as serious. Jess' parents catch her playing football without permission at least 3 or more times in the film, but it seems to be not important because the story just goes on and anyway in the end they just forget about it. You can forget about this movie, too. Perhaps you should watch it just one time so that you can see on your own how bad the editing is. I thought "Bend it like Beckham" is a Hollywood production but all these mediocre montage sequences with the strange music in the foreground let me think of a Bollywood musical from India. At least, this film has nothing to do with David Beckham, football or Indian culture, but uses all these topics to create a flat comedy without sense or important content. So, if you want an entertaining senseless movie and nothing more, watch it!</fullReview>

Basically Jesminder 'Jess' Kaur Bhamra (Parminder Nagra) dreams of being like her football hero, Beckham, and she is obviously really good at football herself. So one day her friend Juliette 'Jules' Paxton (Knightley) helps her get into a girls football team, coached by Joe (Jonathan Rhys Meyers). It seems like everything is going well for the team, and Jess enjoys it, but her parents Mr. Bhamra (Anupam Kher) and Mrs. Bhamra (Shaheen Khan) are against it. Not just because of their religion, but Jess's sister Pinky (Archie Panjabi) is getting, and they want her to be ready. Worst of all, their final match is on the wedding day, but everything turns out alright in the end, eventually. Also starring Shaznay Lewis as Mel, Frank Harper as Alan Paxton, Juliet Stevenson as Paula Paxton, and EastEnders' Ameet Chana as Tony and Pooja Shah as Meena. It was nominated the BAFTA for the Alexander Korda Award for Best British Film, it won The British Comedy Award for Best Comedy Film, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Musical or Comedy. Good!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Someone compared this film to My Big Fat Greek Wedding. While the Greek wedding film was not the greatest film ever made, it is light years distant from this one. The "Greek" film makes fun of certain harmless characteristics of the Greek community. This film tries to draw humour from a truly abhorent practice where mariage is used by parents to mate children not unlike breeders do with their animals. Yes, the Greeks also intensely hope that their children will marry other Greeks, but they do not go as far as actually arranging -or unarranging- marriages against their children wishes. Outside of a slap-stick scenario, such a situation, like child abuse or wife beating, can never be funny or amusing. While the 3 or 4 young actors do a very creditable job, the same cannot be said of the rest of the performing and production crew. One cliché leads to another. Few scenes are truly humorous. Generally speaking, one has the impression of seing a homemade video made by amateurs with access to professional equipment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I Wasn't Very Impressed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like THE FULL MONTY this movie wasn't expected to set the box office alight but like THE FULL MONTY it became a massive international sleeper hit . BEND IT LIKE BECKHAM is rather flawed and the flaws are very similar as the ones seen in THE FULL MONTY .First up is the amount of politics involved , concepts like sexism , traditional Sikh family values and even lesbian love are used to get a laugh but at the same time you feel the production is pulling its punches as to how acceptable this type of humour is in 2002 . If you're going to offend people please do it and be damned otherwise don't bother .This extends to my second criticism of who's side the subtext is taking. Forget the fact that Jess is brought up in a Sikh household and ask yourself this : What would your daughter rather be - An amateur footballer or a professional lawyer ? The screenplay seems to imply that Jess parents are in the wrong for wanting the best for their daughter Thirdly has anyone seen what genre the IMDb classes this movie as a Comedy/ Action ? Romance / and a couple of more genres . Again there's a bit too many irons in too many fires as to what this movie wants to be I wouldn't say I hated BEND IT LIKE BECKHAM but it's not a movie I'll praise to the high heavens either . I do concede that it's very much a ladette chick flick movie dealing with cultural norms and traditions and isn't really for my type of market . I will respect it as a British movie that made a killing at the box office but like so many Brit flicks ( Namely THE FULL MONTY and 28 DAYS LATER ) BEND IT LIKE BECKHAM could have been a lot better</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Who was the audience for this?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We have had a lot of enjoyment out of movies about the Indian culture, so we anxiously awaited this one. There was one about Cricket this year that was especially good. But this one was really hokey. It was too complex for kids and too hokey for adults. The sports sequences were terrible. You couldn't really get connected with this movie. The Indian people were cartoonish; very insulting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing at all</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film is angrily predictable, it has nothing to say but claiming the role of women, in this case in the football or soccer world. But even that is not reached. It is outrageous the way this film show the girls `playing' football (just camera tricks), they are absolutely dreadful playing that game, in some images they are ridiculous running or just with the ball.This horrible film has just one worthy thing, the blonde girl at her incredible 17 year old!!.Gorgeous.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Over hyped formulaic rubbish.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>They used to make B movies once. This is a modern B movie. It is formulaic rubbish. Save your money and go see something decent. If you go to see this movie, you will be reminded of a whole host of better movies that it tries hard to emulate.I had to endure this movie on a long plane flight. I never went to see it at the cinema. It did not lighten my frustration at not being allowed to smoke, in fact it made me more irritable and glad to get off the plane.In short, this film stinks. The charactors aren't even 2 dimensional. I have trees in my back garden that are more rounded than the charactors in the film and whats more, it is more entertaining watching my trees grow.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Crass and Cliché</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What a waste of a good opportuinity. A chance to tell a story about integration of cultures in England using the Beautiful Game as the grinding stone.Instead this movie goes for every (and I mean EVERY) cliché in the book. I was horrified watching this. It took the very worst of Hollywood and transplanted it to England. I honestly cannot believe that this movie did so well on the International circuit. It was lambasted in England on it's release and rightly so. It panders to the lowest common denominator at every turn and lacks any intelligence.The only redeeming factor comes in the form of Jules' mother who convinces herself that her daughter must be lesbian because of her boyish tendencies... to some very English comic relief. But alas even this good turn in taken too far towards ridiculousness in the end.In a word: Rubbish. Go out and find "East is East" to watch a fabulous movie (practically) covering the same issues without the schmalz.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A deceptively light story encouraging rejection of family values</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bend It Like Beckham is a fun and touching exploration of a girl's desires to excel in the face of immense cultural opposition. Along the way, it has a lot to say about stereotypes. While I found the story somewhat interesting although very predictable, I kept waiting for the underlying values to come through all the opposition. It finally dawned on me that the rejection of everything traditional *was* the underlying value. Religious and cultural mores are by definition wrong; follow your heart and ignore any consequences. It seems to work great for the protagonist here; how well would it work for a young man who doesn't have the strong family Jess has, who is struggling with a drug addiction and thinking about robbing a liquor store for the much-needed cash? Maybe the moral here is not as lofty as it seems.There is a mix of a lot of different things thrown together in this film, such as tying multiple different prejudices to family traditions, showing that girls are really better than boys, and indicating through the displayed family attitudes that any moral objections to anything are rooted in immorality -- a nicely circular argument.One very good note in this is when Jess finally refuses to lie to her parents any more. She is making an existential stand and decides to do what she believes is right. That her decision to do so is completely apart from respect for family values, though, is clear enough.I can see why so many young women like this movie. As a father, I found it troubling to say the least.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you like football, you still won't like this movie.If you like movies, you still won't like this movie.If you like anything remotely entertaining, you won't like this movie.This is a very very boring film. I *think* it's supposed to be a comedy, but there is not one remotely funny joke in this film. Not one! It's supposed to be about "fitting in" but is it truly terrible and has no message, it's just a waste of your time.DO NOT WATCH THIS FILM</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A gay movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was rotten. The acting was awful and the plot was mired in star crossed love triangles. There's even a homosexual section so everyone's properly offended. The only thing they didn't do here is kill a whale and run over a nativity scene with a satanic dump truck. You'd be better off watching a movie like the one with Will Farrell coaching a soccer team than seeing this dribble. Don't bother seeing this movie unless your tastes are horrible or you enjoy seeing 12 year old homos. It's enough to make the average person sick. Its no wonder they only ended up showing this movie in "limited theatres". No one went to watch it for good reason.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>this is the worst movie i've seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>this movie... it doesn't care about you, it wishes to simplify you and have you accept it, on those terms. It is propaganda. it had lowered the bar on what movie's should be about. if you want ethnic identity to stain your movie exp. then go for it. if not, then brace yourself for the greatest underestimation of the audience. i hate this movie. if i had the choice to watch this movie again, i would only accept if 1) my family were held hostage, 2) i was faced with the most gruesome torture, 3) i was brainwashed into being blind to the sensibilities that make up my movie experience. This movie will molest you. It neglect you, like a bad lover, into wanting to be more then it is, because of swooning empty promises and ideas. a plague on your houses.</fullReview>
