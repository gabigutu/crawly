		<shortDescription>Keira can sing! Nice feel good movie about music making today</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a feel good movie about musicians making an album. Mark Ruffalo and Keira Knightley play producer and song writer who team up to make a demo filmed all over the city. The songs are pleasant and the characters are sympathetic and likable even Hailee Steinfeld as Mark's daughter. There is a nice dynamic between the characters which makes the movie enjoyable to watch. There is almost as much music as a musical but it doesn't feel much like a musical.Who knew Keira could sing so well? She doesn't have the most powerful voice but her singing is musical and right for the type of songs. Mark looks suitably scruffy for the fallen on hard times composer. Nice cameo by Ceelo Green and Adam Levine who sings quite a few songs.Movies like this are pleasant and uplifting to watch - if you want a break from action or violence of summer blockbusters.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"A movie about modern advances dismantling the art industry as we know it by replacing the high-paid middle-men with IT, bringing artist closer to audience." Doesn't sound like a thrilling blurb, but this movie brings the story to live with incredible writing, great music, wonderful performances and a brilliant vision. Just like in "Once," this not-love-story side-steps the romance plot Hollywood usually uses like a crutch and focuses on the struggle and triumph or artistic endeavor. (most mainstream stories end with the message that the only happy ending ends in breeding. This tale recognizes the value of humankind's other creative capabilities.) Not that the film's all esoteric and above family. There are all kinds of emotional wounds we suffer in this life, in our families. Rather than a sub-plot focused on starting a family, this story's sub-plot focuses on both growing strong after a family fails (harder) and on repairing another failed family (hardest).And that's all below the point.Music! What wonderful music they used in this film, from the soundtrack to the original performances. The way they bring the performances and the creative process to life - the pain, the joy, the failures and triumphs - is just thrilling. This is the kind of film that will make you want to get up and MAKE STUFF. And then put it out there because you can. You don't need the middle-men anymore. You don't need the industry.To create is the highest expression of humanity and so, perhaps, making art (like this film) that inspires creativity in others is yet a step above.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Once again, Carney wins me.I'll let the other reviewers introduce you to the characters and the plot, I'll just say this -- for me, this is a perfect movie. It took hold of me from the start, took me down to the depths, up to the heights, and never let me go until the last frame. Perfect execution: casting, performances, writing. The actors just nail it, especially Knightley and Ruffalo, though I would have liked to have seen more done with Catherine Keener.I rarely watch movies twice, but there are people I want to share this with, and I ordered the soundtrack as soon as I returned home.How will they finish this, I kept thinking toward the end. The answer? Perfectly.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't judge a book...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>John Carney is one of the few people working in movies today whose next work I am always eager to see. Along with a few others such as Richard Linklater, he has proved to me that you can take a premise which has been explored many times before and view it from a different perspective to create something that feels original and fresh. His previous work 'Once' did this and is among my favourite films.Suffice to say, when I saw the trailer for Begin Again it simply did not grab me. My first worry was that it looked 'too Hollywood' (read as 'cliche and predictable movie churned out to make money with little care or thought for the story it is telling'). I felt a little worried going in to see the film that somehow Mr. Carney had fallen foul of the big producers, making sacrifices to the story in order to get some 'names' into it.However, around 20 minutes in, my hopes returned and I knew it was going to be special... and it just got better from there. the film builds on the story and characters as it goes on, making me care about them, showing me things I had never seen before in similar movies and above all, making me think. As the credits rolled, I was wiping my eyes, partly from the wonderful soundtrack but mostly because Begin Again is a magical film. It still has the 'spark' that I felt in his previous pictures, a huge amount of love, passion and care that has brought it into being - not just a half baked idea thrown out there to pay back impatient investors. The soundtrack, performances and well-crafted script took me on an emotionally rewarding journey, leaving me feeling inspired, uplifted and a little nostalgic for times gone by. yep, I am gushing, but it really is going to be hard to beat for film of the year for me. Between the scenes, I also loved how it discreetly touched on some important issues with throwaway lines, addressing things which people take for granted these days: 'Music is for the ears, not the eyes.' and 'don't dress like you are easy' being two of them. Image is so ingrained into art these days, the majority of people all seem to judge a book by it's cover without looking inside. And the same could be said for this film too. On the outside it looks like yet another generic, manufactured Pop Idol... but if you sit down and watch it, I think you will be pleasantly surprised that it has something profound to say and says it well. Thought provoking, life affirming and highly recommended!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A refreshing film ...without explosions?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I knew virtually nothing about this film - hadn't even seen the trailer - when I drug my wife to see it last night, and we were both very pleasantly surprised. The characters are drawn in such a way that they are both like-able and relatable. In the end, the film builds emotion with the audience not by means of incredible stretches of the imagination, but through a gradually reinforced empathy. I have seen all the summer blockbusters, and the single largest failure in most of them is that they create shallow characters that the audience does not care about. The dynamics used in this movie cause an engagement in the audience that is necessary in ANY film for it to be great. This one is not to be missed in the CGI-filled summer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Really a pleasant surprise - delightfully not full of cheese!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was expecting a cheesy film. I am not into musicals so was hesitant to commit to this film, in a theatre. But, I was pleasantly surprised. I find some of Ruffalos work, like Now you see me, to be hard to sit through. I did not dislike that film, but I hated his performance. Part of it was how vapid the character was. In this film it is the opposite. He is charming, roguish, creative, and delightful to watch. Quite frankly I did not think Knightly was up to this either. Was I ever surprised. She was great. Well written, well directed, and very good overall. In these days of Hollywood losing its edge, and producing more and more low quality, derivative work, it is refreshing to see a film like this one. And I did not even need to use my earplugs. Transformer this film was not. Thankfully.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First, I love that you put the song, Thinking About Your Love, by Skipworth and Turner, in this movie! I've always loved their songs, beat and talent. Great choice. The original music was also quite good! Mark Ruffalo and Keira Knightly were great, as well as his wife, Catherine Keener, who is always great, and the daughter, Hailee Steinfeld. I love the whole idea of the movie. I could imagine it was fun from the moment John Carney wrote it and set about making it in to a movie. The idea for an album is too clever. Toying with love interests also kept the movie intriguing as did the creative process that was always at work, throughout the movie. My number one judge of a good movie is did it hold my interest and this movie definitely did. I think another way of putting it would be, did the movie seem like it did not seem long, whatever the length of the movie, if it didn't seem long, then it worked, because you lost track of time by being drawn in to the story and characters. Great story and movie! I definitely recommend people go see it and hope it catches fire, because it's much better than most of the movies that are out this summer.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>3 1/2 out of 4 stars.John Carney is back with a new musical. His 2006 film "Once" is one of my favorite films of all time and I was interested to see where Carney would go next. Watching the trailers for "Begin Again" didn't give me much hope for it, but just enough for me to go out and see it. I enjoyed it much more than I expected though."Begin Again" is very similar to "Once," except Carney has a bigger budget and famous movie stars. It deals with Dan and Greta (Mark Ruffalo and Keira Knightley, respectively) who after being cheated on by their former boyfriend/girlfriend meet up and record some songs together. Ruffalo is great as the down on his luck, charming, but often drunk, music producer Dan. Knightley also has a solid performance. Adam Levine does a good job of being a jerk and James Corden is hilarious as Greta's busking friend Steve. The films has themes of love, fatherhood, and the way we use music in our lives."Begin Again" is for all the music lovers out there who enjoy creating music. The movie is filled with characters whose religion is music. Look at Dan's car and how he has a music cable hung up on the mirror next to a cross. There's a great moment when Dan listens to Greta perform for the first time. What is just a voice and guitar slowly grows into something much bigger and beautiful. The soundtrack is more poppy compared to the folk songs in "Once," but they are nice to listen to.This film is the movie you kind of have to be in the mood for to really enjoy. It can be predictable and sappy at times, but it does it well. If you accept it for what it is, you'll enjoy it. "Begin Again" is a musical treat this summer that will leave you wanting to listen to more music and maybe even creating some of your own.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The music in our lives</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was a big fan of the group the Frames and was very excited when I learned about "Once" directed by John Carney and starring Glen Hasard both members of the Frames. I enjoyed it quite a bit, but it had an almost documentary like feel to it. Begin again for me was a statement about how music affects our lives and how different songs can take on different meanings for all of us. For my wife and myself , Ben Folds the Luckiest has a special meaning in our relationship, to most others, it is just another song.I loved how Begin Again opens with a rather banal sounding song being sung by Kiera Knightly in a small nightclub as Ruffalo stands enthralled. Then for the next 15 minutes we discover why.The movie uses music in that way several times and I felt it really worked. Your enjoyment of the film will probably be greatly determined by what you think of the music. I happened to love it. Even that banal song soon takes on all new meaning. The entire cast is great and Ruffalo certainly delivers one of his strongest performances.I have not seen Words and Pictures. My limited knowledge of the film is that it might have a similar theme when it comes to music in our lives. This is a little feel good movie. The kind of film that is a welcome respite in Summer blockbuster season. Last year we had the Way Way back to fill this niche. This year is is Begin Again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For a movie about trying not to be cliché and cheesy, it was just that. From the portrayal of the cliché music company exec who says, "Capiche," to the all white group of alley kids extorting cigarettes suddenly cooperating to sing background vocals. The daughter, whose mother says is "Terrible" on guitar suddenly plays like Hendrix? Please! This movie was cliché after cliché and held no integrity for its art like it professed in its story. I'm puzzled at how others were able to offer such high ratings for such a ho-hum effort. Either insider connections trying to hype their friends' work or hired review writers. Not sure. Half a star for the story + half a star for the song.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The reviews on IMDb give this film a reasonable rating. Given that I went to see on the big screen. Sorry folks but it is 100 minutes long and seemed like a week. There is nothing good I can say about it, to say it was awful would be about right. Keira Knightly is so bad in this film, it makes me wonder if she has any acting ability at all. I am yet to see her give a decent performance. If this film had to be made, then she was miscast. It is a straight to DVD TV film, in other words a waste of nearly two hours.There are thousands of better stories and better actors out there, I just get annoyed when one pays good money to watch this slush.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I walked into Begin Again, after having to work a full day at the office on a Saturday. Suffice it to say, I wasn't in the best of moods.So, I decided that I wanted to watch a movie that would improve my mood and also cater to my love of music. Thankfully, begin again did both.I loved the premise; two people down on their luck in love and life join forces to make beautiful music.The acting was wonderful. I couldn't believe Keira Knightley has such a beautiful singing voice. Her voice is light, lyrical and airy, but quite emotive. I thought she was the perfect fit for the role of Greta, not just because of her voice, but also because she brought a fragile, yet optimistic quality to Greta. There is a moment, in the movie, where she comes to a very painful realization and she plays it perfectly. Who hasn't been where her character was in that moment? Mark Ruffalo is amazing. He played the heck out of his character, who was all over the place. Loved the transformation of his character upon rediscovering his love of music. James Corden was hilarious and who knew Adam Levine could actually act? He was pretty good in this movie. I think John Carney hit gold with this cast.The music was lovely. It's got a quiet, folksy ambiance and is quite relaxing...well, after a tough day at the office, I welcomed this. Listening to the soundtrack after work with a good, chilled glass of wine is heaven.New York is its own character in the movie, and it, too, was great. This movie reminded me how magic New York can be. The scene where Greta and Dan walk through New York at night, sharing a headset was just magical. I actually think this is one of those scenes that may be remembered in years to come. Keira and Mark had perfect chemistry in that scene and you could feel their connection through music.Were there weaknesses with movie, sure? It's a bit clichéd, and of course everything works out in the end. However, that didn't bother me at all, because you walk in knowing it's a feel good movie, and the movie doesn't pretend it's something that it's not.The crowd I was watching the movie with applauded and walked out in a happy mood, and really isn't that what movies are all about? Having you feel something, walking out happy, sad or contemplative?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Once" twice: does lightning strike again?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Begin Again" (2013 release; 100 min.) brings the story of Greta (played by Keira Knightley) and Dan (played by Marc Ruffalo). As the movie opens, we find Greta reluctantly going on stage in a small bar venue to play a song, urged on by a friend. By complete coincidence Dan, a veteran of the music business, is in the audience, and loves what he's hearing. We later learn the background of how these two characters ended up in that very place, as things have not been going as planned (and I'm being mild). Dan tells her he wants to record an album with/for her. Along the way we get to know the side characters (Dan's wife and 14 yr. old daughter--both estranged from Dan), and Dave (played by Maroon 5's Adam Levine), Greta's boyfriend who has just hit the big time. To tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: as a general matter and contrary to apparently many other reviewers, I did not "fall" for this movie like I did for "Once", writer-director John Carney's previous tale of romance and music. In fact, when it comes down to it, this movie is nothing more that a re-imagined "Once", set in a different city and with different leads, but in the end it is nothing more than a variation of what we've already seen. Lightning does not strike again: as sincere and moving and impossible Once was, as contrived and unoriginal and self-evident Begin Again is. There are still a couple of great scenes in the movie, reason I'm giving it 5 stars out of 10, and which I cannot describe in more details so as not to give away anything.And then just when you've think you've seen it all, comes the ending of the movie. Wow, just wow. The irony of it all. (For more details, please see my comments in the movie's discussion threat here on IMDb, under "The Ending (spoilers obviously)".</fullReview>

Some of the songs are quite enjoyable, and they make the story a little more believable. But hold on! What story? A girl who gets dumped by her emerging star boyfriend meets an exec guy from the music industry who falls in love with her singing. And they both spend the whole movie recording her songs around NY city to release an album at the end.

		<shortDescription>An Un-authentic Movie about Authenticity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>John Carney pulled off a miracle with ONCE, a romantic fable fueled by charming acting performances and genuinely beautiful and passionate, original music. In my recollection, it is the one and only film that made me cry ? not solely because I cared so much for its characters, but because I didn't want my all-too-brief glimpse into their world to end. The fact that Carney pulled this off for a paltry $100,000 resulting in an Academy Award winning song and a Broadway musical only makes his feat that much more miraculous. So, I was eagerly anticipating BEGIN AGAIN. Maybe my expectations were too high. You can't fault the acting performances in Carney's second peek into the world of contemporary music. Mark Ruffalo is, as always, multi-layered and heartfelt. His plight, as an alcoholic, divorced A&amp;R man/failed father on the skids is vividly drawn. And, if those personal flaws weren't enough to doom his career, his idealistic, bull-headed insistence on working with "authentic" artists in an era of derivative, technologically manufactured music pushes him right up to the edge of precarious cliff. And, here is exactly where film dooms itself. In Ruffalo's Dan and Keira Knightly's Gretta, Carney has written two characters who refuse to compromise the integrity of their work. This conceit demands that the script, the casting, and the entire ambiance of the film be authentic -- which it simply isn't. In ONCE, the lead actors Glen Hansard and Marketa Irglova were real, professional singer/songwriters. They wrote and performed their own songs with complete conviction. To play Gretta, Knightly had to "learn" guitar, which she mimes, but only barely. Her voice is unexceptional, not one that would believably attract Dan to risk his last chance on. And, most importantly, BEGIN AGAIN's songs are at best okay, in total unremarkable. The idea that Gretta and this thrown-together band could actually record state-of-the-art live performances in public places in New York City is technically possible, but pragmatically preposterous. And, if Dan is truly striving for authenticity, recording Gretta in a cheap digital format would be the last way he would go. Movies about music performance and production are, more often than not, shot without much attention to how it really happens. Directors usually get away with it because the public at large doesn't know any better. Cameron Crowe's brilliant ALMOST FAMOUS is an example of a film that absolutely nailed it. It's disappointing to see a film that pontificates about authenticity, yet fails so miserably to achieve it. The fine actors in this film all have their moments. Regardless of her musical shortcomings, Knightly exudes enormous charm. Adam Levine is surprisingly genuine and believable. Up and comer Hailee Steinfeld and the invariably wonderful Catherine Keener are excellent. The most-deft supporting performance is turned in by Mos Def.I do have to complement Carney that his script resists the temptation to allow Dan and Gretta to succumb to their obvious attraction to one another. However, for Gretta to choose to virtually "give" downloads of her album away for a dollar states nothing. It only reinforces the old saying, "I bought it for a song." Music is a treasure that should be valued. Music enriches our lives. There is no integrity in an "artist" giving his or her work away, especially after a group of dedicated musicians (with a piece of the back end) devoted so much sweat equity into realizing those songs. With BEGIN AGAIN, John Carney has once again proved he is capable of writing charming characters and excellent dialog. Let's hope he endeavors to take his next story outside of the music business.</fullReview>

I don't consider myself to be a music elitist; I can appreciate most forms of music. However, the music (presumably) written for the movie is bland and quickly forgettable. I'm not sure what scene the music is trying to appeal to, but it seems to me like all of it was written by committee, being as generic and inoffensive as possible, all the while having no real melody.The story also suffered from poor writing in several spots. Plot contrivances abound, and the end of the movie is equally puzzling and underwhelming.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A charming, largely effective twist on a tale that's been told many times before.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You've seen it all before. Strictly speaking, Begin Again doesn't have the most original of story lines - movies, specifically romantic comedies and sports movies, have long built their predictable happy endings out of opposites attracting, spinning tales of Disillusioned Person A finding inspiration from Disillusioned Person B, and vice versa. The fact that this film comes with added original music isn't even that much of an innovation - writer-director John Carney did the same thing in Once, his own much-beloved musical romance from 2006. But, for all that, Begin Again remains appealing because it refuses to settle comfortably into any one genre. Funny, dramatic, romantic and platonic, the film navigates its cast of characters with much skill and tenderness.Dan (Mark Ruffalo) is a mess: once a groundbreaking executive of his own indie record label, he's floundering helplessly in a life he no longer recognises. He's alienated his wife Miriam (Catherine Keener) and teenage daughter Violet (Hailee Steinfeld), and his partner Saul (Yasiin Bey a.k.a. Mos Def) has just fired him. Musically-inclined Greta (Keira Knightley) isn't having all that great a time of it either: she moved to New York with her boyfriend Dave (Adam Levine), but he's too busy having his head turned by fame and other girls as he hits the big time. When Dan hears Greta singing in a rundown bar, he resolves to make music with her - even if no one else believes he can do it.When examined in its broadest strokes, Begin Again isn't anything special. There's never any doubt that this story will turn out well, that its protagonists will help each other move out of their dark romantic pasts. Its deliberately quirky-cute plot veers frequently towards the corny and predictable, as Dan and Greta set about making the indie-est of indie albums, guerrilla-style on the streets of New York. Of course they'll meet like-minded, kooky people who help them achieve their goal. And yes, Dan will find a way to bond with Violet in the process, just as Greta figures out just what she wants (or doesn't want) from her relationship with Dave.But Begin Again is a far better film in its details, largely because Carney lavishes a lot of thought, love and hope on his characters. Dan, for one, grows as the film does, the layers of hurt and anger shrouding him and his bad choices slowly peeling away to reveal the damaged soul hiding beneath. There's even something unexpectedly rich about the interaction between Greta and stereotypical bastard boyfriend Dave: he is every bit the jerk he appears on screen, and yet, Carney lends credence to their relationship with some genuinely emotional moments, anchored by a song she writes for him (Lost Stars). Greta's time with Dave, Carney seems to suggest, is not wasted, even if her trust in him might be misplaced. That's an unusually complex thought for a film that's so apparently slight.The way the film ends, too, comes as a welcome surprise. Unlike the more vapid rom-coms for which it might be easily mistaken, Begin Again chooses to focus on a deeper kind of love story. The love that Dan and Greta eventually share is of a pleasingly unique kind - a connection that isn't romantic or, at least, not purely so. They are also friends and kindred spirits: relationships that typically get short shrift the moment a guy and a girl are placed in the same scene together.Having scored a hit with Once, Carney can now afford big-name Hollywood actors. Fortunately, he also chose A-list actors who have quite enough skill and charisma to make the hokier parts of the script work. Ruffalo again manages to lend Dan, a generally rumpled mess of rage, his own innate charm and sweetness. Even at his most reprehensible, Dan - in Ruffalo's hands - feels more like a lost soul than an unforgivable one. Knightley makes up for her less-than-arresting singing voice with her most sympathetic performance in ages. James Corden turns in an amusing performance as Greta's hapless panhandling friend Steve, although Keener - a fine character actress - is robbed of the opportunity to lend Miriam more depth (especially considering a revelation that comes later in the film). Better in its execution than conception, Begin Again is an amiably tough-minded twist on a plot you've seen a thousand times before. The film never really reaches spectacular heights, nor does it re-invent the wheel. But it's a smart, sweet and mostly very effective take on a story that could have been a hundred times more predictable and cloying. That, in itself, is quite the achievement.</fullReview>

Anyway, didn't the Partridge Family already cover this material in 4 seasons and 96 obnoxious television episodes featuring an annoying family performing in random venues as well as their garage? Don't the Cowsills get any credit here? At least the Archies were a cartoon band and didn't tarnish their acting careers like Ruffalo and Knightley do in this dreadful production. The guitarist twanging a collection of sour notes containing multiple special audio effects to hide the actual proficiency of musical talent made me cringe. And where is the tambourine player that I hear on nearly every song? I suppose this was a way for the everyone in the production to let loose and have a good time but it felt like having to watch a bad episode of The Monkees again and again. Hopefully this film and all the worn out conventions and superficial heart rending plot devices will take a nose dive with this so we never have to view this kind of entertainment ever again. At least the neck stubble and self importance of Adam Levine were offensive enough to let us see him for what he really is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Never before in the entirety of my life have I ever advocated for a romantic drama movie let alone a musical drama. But I guess an exception had to be made when I came across Begin Again.The film begins with a shot in the bar of Gretta (Keira Knightely) reluctantly performing at an open-mic night. Gretta an independent and tough singer-songwriter who's coping from a recent heart break catches the eye of Dan (Mark Ruffalo) an out of work record label executive.A chance occurrence brings together these two lost souls for a musical journey that takes them through every street and corner of the beautiful New York City. Director Carney does an exceptional job in creating a wonderful medley that lasts throughout the film.In one the scenes Dan says, "One of the most banal scenes is suddenly invested with so much meaning! All these banalities - They're suddenly turned into these... these beautiful, effervescent pearls. From Music.".Well that's exactly what happens. Carney takes a simple scene and brilliantly transforms it into a melodious performance.From the very beginning of the movie you'll find yourself tapping to every tune and singing to every lyrical poetry. As you take this wonderful joy ride you'll find yourself completely immersed in the lives of these two damaged characters and their journey to help each other out of their despair. Carney takes you on an emotional ride which is surprisingly uncliched.Ruffalo plays the character of a middle aged train wreck in the most subtle way possible. Knightley's stunningly soulful voice will bring a definite smile on your face. There is an unusually surprising chemistry between the two which makes this journey even more creative.To be very honest I didn't have any expectation and unsurprisingly thought it would be your next door clichéd drama. But obviously I was proved wrong. Carny uses your basic girl meets boy formula but then intelligently deviates away from it to give you a creative musical drama. I realise I may sound like a broken record, but it's simply to emphasize the impact this had on me. So whoever made it to the end this review do check out the movie and let me know what you think. Until next time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Music Over Substance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie has some great musical scenes, which are the film's best asset, but also the problem.The plot's not that substantial, relationships ending/beginning, with discussions about selling out in the music industry. Nothing new here. Things always perk up when the music starts. Everyone seems to play music really well without any apparent rehearsals. All the characters are cool and have a great rapport with one another. No one's shy about dancing. Could I call this anti-realism? I almost felt someone took a porn script, substituted music for the sex, and made this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>lovable movie ,, amazing Casting ,, the songs, the directing , i already started downloading the soundtracks . so the movie started in two separated paths ,one for the singer (Gretta) and one for the producer (Dan) two different perspectives that led to the moment they met... so that was a nice touch. the plot was so real,it seemed like it really represented the music industry.-. honestly tho, Keira Knightley's laugh is mad ,, it's magical with her little tilted tooth,, gosh she's gorgeous ;) the ending was also unpredictable ,, loved the way it was wrapped up. overall, it was a really good movie. and being nominated for the music at least was justifiable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazed.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the first time that I've seen this movie. I just finished watching it and I've been sitting here mesmerized ever since. See, I was all mopey and upset over life drama and I went to amazon to find something generic to help me fall asleep.Well, I'm still awake. And I'm still pondering the entirety of this film. I absolutely do not want to give away any spoilers, but I absolutely want to share this beauty with the world. It just got everything RIGHT. The daughter. The execs. The bonds. The lack of depression and drama in the middle. I kept hoping that everything wouldn't fail and be destroyed and that things would actually go okay for people. And I was not only impressed, but I was not let down. Everything went how it should. Yes, there were tears and resentment and anger. But there was this coming-of-age thing and an enlightenment thing and an aha! thing and an I get it thing. I'm blown away. The sweetness and tenderness of this movie stole my heart. I believed every single actor every single time. The little moments were so right. That look between Mark and Keira. That single second in time is my favorite I've seen. Because they chose correctly. And it was brilliant and beautiful and real and honest. Ahhh.I indeed loved this film, but I have to give it 9/10 stars because I'm nitpicking on two things that shouldn't even be looked at as negatives. Kind of like a, "if I MUST find SOMETHING wrong..." scenario. One is that I thought the kids being involved in the one scene (I'm trying to leave out spoilers) seemed a tiny bit forced to me. Like an episode of Glee where everyone comes together to spontaneously sing a bit too well. It should have warmed my heart but I just felt awkward for them. Sorry. Hate me. The second was that I didn't think Dan's daughter should have been a child prodigy so fast. I wanted more of a back story and for her to be shy and nervous and screw up a few times and then she could learn her ultimate passion for it. I loved her relationship with Greta. I just wish we saw a few more minutes of her evolving before she was evolved. All in all, I am keeping this special film in my pocket for the future. It was truly a feel-good movie, but it was so much more than that. It made me cry at the sheer goodness of it. The music, the relationships, the little things. I loved it all. I wasn't sure why Keira had to dress like she was a middle aged woman in the 90's at times, but she made it work so well.Basically what I am saying is that I adored every second of this. I'm going to go to sleep now.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pleasant but insubstantial.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was late to the party on this one. Begin Again had a 'blink and you'll miss it' release and I did. It's not hard to see why: though it is warmly entertaining, it is, ultimately, flimsy and unmemorable.Written and directed by John Carney, whose biggest hit to date remains 2006's Once, Begin Again shares a similar theme: a couple making music and discovering themselves.Gretta (Keira Knightley) accompanies her musician boyfriend Dave (Adam Levine) to New York when he signs a deal with a major record deal. But while the world glows for him, Gretta soon finds herself the first casualty of his new-found fame and wandering Manhattan alone, but for the company of old friend and busker, Steve (James Cordon). By chance, she is thrown together with disgraced record label executive Dan (Mark Ruffalo) and, astounded by her raw talent, he signs her up for a quirky musical collaboration around New York City.And therein lies my biggest issue with Begin Again: Dan is astounded by Gretta's talent, I wasn't. Yes, it is pleasant, her singing is easy on the ear and her lyrics are several ranks higher than the Cheeky Girls, but she's no Leonard Cohen.Like Gretta's musical output, Begin Again is twee, easy and simple, it is moving wallpaper that doesn't cause any offence. We've seen it before, we've enjoyed it more and last time around, in Once, Carney didn't dilute it. It strikes me that Carney has poured this one out to satisfy the teeny audiences who were told they should have loved Once but just didn't get it.Knightly is fine, Ruffalo is as good as ever, Cordon is slightly less over the top than usual. The plot is simple, the father/daughter subplot is obvious, everything is laid out very carefully for the audiences that need life explained fully for them to understand. Begin Again is all just a little bit plinky plonk, it is obvious and idealistic and, particularly in the instance of the family dancing sequence, plain embarrassing.I love the idea of a group of musicians recording an album in the open around New York but there has to be a far better way of presenting it to the world.Pleasant but insubstantial. Begin Again? Please don't.For more reviews from The Squiss, subscribe to my blog and like the Facebook page.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Once Was Enough</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You can get so far ahead of this picture, you may have to go to the corner for snacks and back to let it catch up. If you don't see a plot development coming, they will sing a song about it. Don't worry. I have a soft spot for movies about music and musicians who triumph although the music is undeniably terrible. And it is. Keira Knightley, I assume, does her own whispery, little girl singing and the acting is in the mumble, behavioral style which is sure-fire to glaze your interest in most any of the characters. We are told much was improvised. Much like the music that was not written because no one here reads music or can compose. Songs are "written" in diaries or on crumpled pieces of paper lending them "authenticity" in this type of sing spiel. Mark Ruffalo gives the film some weight and humor, as he always does, but he's wasted in this less than middle-brow pawn to the pop music industry. Knightley looks anorexic and actually seems to lose weight during the film and developed a prominent under bite by the end. James Corden has enough to do to show he could be a major film actor with the right script. Cinematography shows New York's lower east side at its seediest. Catherine Keener, as fine an actress in films as there is, gets the thankless ex role.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beyond dire</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I came to this film on the back of the reviews which in retrospect must surely have been written by people associated with it. It is that bad. The basic premise is okay; hardly original and inspired but with the right screen writer and an alternate leading lady (one with some credibility and appeal) it might have been moderately entertaining. But sadly it has neither. The storyline is way beyond predictable - I defy anyone not to work out the ending by half way through. Keira Knightley is hideously miscast and the others just limp along with a limp script. The music is also incredibly lame. If you are looking for a film with music as its backbone head for the wonderful Rudderless and give this sorry mess a wide berth. One star is generous.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Everyone who scored this over a 6 should send ME $1 (inside movie factoid) for tricking me to sit through this contrived snore fest. The story was so unoriginal and the acting and script made it even worse. Ruffalo so overcooked his character you can't help but roll your eyes. If Keira flashed one more knowing "this is my sexy money shot" smirk, I was going to lose it. My wife thought the movie was decent and she walks out (seriously....10 minutes in to award winning movies she gets up and walks) on 9/10 good movies we attend. She's the barometer of reverse taste. As far as the positive comments on her singing, it was decent even though the music numbers looked fake. If you're up for 2 hrs of ultimate "meh" go for it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sweet film set in summertime is a Surprise Delight.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Watching Begin Again reminds us so much of summertime in New York City that you are almost transported, but luckily you get to skip the hot garbage smell.Begin Again is a sweet little film about redemption and staying true to yourself, all set in the vibrant city of New York, where music and location are integral characters in the story.Dan (Mark Ruffalo) used to be a top music executive, but personal problems and a lack of a 'star' has caused him to slip in reputation at his label. Unceremoniously released, he goes on a binge to drown his sorrows, which leads him to a bar in the East Village where Gretta (Keira Knightley) is performing. To him, she sounds like gold. Gretta is very resistant in signing to any major label because she refuses to compromise her art. Also, her long time love and songwriting partner Dave (Adam Levine) recently got a record deal and then everything changed for the worse. From this encounter, Dan and Gretta collaborate to create the music he knows she has deep within her raw talent, and in doing so emerges the powerful transformative ability from music.Begin Again manages to hit all the right notes (Don't hate me, I couldn't help it!) in being a sweet summer film perfect for a light watch on a summer evening. There is something sentimental without being obnoxious and I do believe it comes from the writer/director John Carney's own love and appreciation of music. There is a striking adherence and devotion to music, composition and authenticity that resonates throughout the entire film which can only be possible thanks to the film's creator.As a film about music, songwriters and performing ? all the actors involved do a super job, especially Keira Knightley whose singing ability was a virtual unknown prior to this film. Begin Again focuses on the underground alternative/indie scene which is supplementary to her soft and possibly unsure singing style. James Corden who plays Steve, Gretta's old schoolmate and only friend in NYC, is a breath of fresh air in every scene. His energy and innate ability is captivating and his character is a nice antithesis to Adam Levine's contrived douchiness as Dave.So if you find yourself longing for summer on a cold winter night or in need of a delightful film for a casual one-time watch then Begin Again is your girl.Please check out our WEBSITE for all the REVIEWS of recent releases and indie films!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Whole more than the sum of the parts ... it works</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In spite of a number of structural and script flaws, this tasty little gem works as well or better than any half-dozen "feel good" films that wandered out of Hollywood in the last few years. Recommended.(One example: a key script point is when one of the characters leaves a "voice message" for another which is actually an entire song. There isn't a voice mail system on the planet which would accept that length of message. Another oddity is the casting of Hailee Steinfeld as a statuesque 14 year old teenager, a casting choice made all the stranger by the fact that she was 17 at the time of filming and looked like she was in her late 20s. In fact this actress, who played the lead in TRUE GRIT at age 13, should have a patent on looking older than she is.)The good news? Much the same way that John Carney's script emphasizes vision as the key ingredient for a successful song, his own vision is more than enough to compensate for some of the strangeness here, and the film works very much in the style of those classic British comedies of manners we don't see much of anymore (a la 3 Weddings...) Other notes for the die-hard fans: * Knightly and Ruffalo spent much of their careers making other actors look good. Nice to see them get a chance to make themselves look good * Wow. Who knew Adam Levine could act? Fact is, he is a natural and comes across better here than as a judge in that infamous show. Can't say the same for Ceelo who is just as uncomfortable as an actor as he is in reality TV * is there an award for best integrated closing credits? Not talking bloopers here, but scenes that run in the credits which actually complement the film ... best I have ever seen ... if all closing credits were this good, viewers would stay to the very end</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm a big fan of the movie "Once" but "Begin Again" was so bad that I think I have to go back and watch "Once" just to make sure it wasn't also a horrible movie. Wow! John Carney really crapped the bed on this one. Mark Ruffalo, who I have always liked in the past, phones in a terrible and clichéd performance. While I can't claim to have been a Keira Knightley fan, I never really hated her but I will probably never sit through another one of her movies after this one. I can't imagine what all of the people who liked this movie saw in it. Really. I can't. It actually makes me wonder if the positive reviews were all written by a paid PR team. This movie was THAT bad. Some highlights: horrible music, clichéd dialogue, repulsive acting, that guy from Maroon 5 sporting a beard, Keira taking a hipster bike ride through NYC, the end of Ruffalo's previously stellar career, directed like an NYU film school project, horrible music, spouting off about "bad" and "commercial" music but every song in the movie was commercial garbage, the cliché line "you can learn a lot about someone from their play-list," ... I can't keep going ... I just can't. My recommendation, stay far away from this movie. My rating, two thumbs up the writer/director's dark cleft.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I enjoyed the movie, mainly because of the music, the soundtrack is awesome. The story is there for the music. The story is the background for the music, the reason for the music, since this movie is about song writers and producing music. It is a fun story, engaging, but not real. Either things go real downwards or so they say, or upwards. When upwards, everything goes so smooth. The characters are so one dimensional, no real human interaction, no emotions, even though they mention real heavy staff, but none of it really gets into the movie. Everything is for the music and the music is so much fun. Real great music. This movie made me want to here that music on and on.</fullReview>

Yet everything can be changed just because this one song, every single moment can a pearl just because of the music.The characters were fantastic in the film. The interaction between each of them was just so genuine, especially between Gretta and Dan. I am really glad that the film did not end up like an ordinary happily ever after. We can see that each character had grown throughout the film. It also pointed out the problems of music industry in the society now, leaving the space for audience to reflect to their own lives.The soundtracks in the film were simply awesome. It is the music that made this film so great and relatable, and it would be a totally different story if the film went without those marvellous tracks. They gave the cold reality a bit of light, warmth, and gentleness.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sometimes you just know when a film isn't for you. This is not the same experience as watching a "bad" film, with deficiencies of script, characterization and directorial technique. The issue centers over questions of taste: what viewers expect from a film and what they are actually presented with.This is certainly the case with John Carney's BEGIN AGAIN. The plot is straightforward: Brit expat Gretta (Keira Knightley) has a long- term relationship with Dave (Adam Levime) which crashes on the rocks when Dave is catapulted to stardom and has a brief fling with publicist Mim (Jennifer Li). Gretta meets accidentally with washed- up producer Dan (Mark Ruffalo) in a New York bar, and after an iffy start, the two of them agree to produce a do-it-yourself album of Gretta's songs, with the help of amateur musicians, Dan's daughter Violet (Hailee Stanfield), and some of Dan's acquaintances in the music business. The plot is an old one, a recycling of the "Let's Put on a Show" genre historically associated with Mickey Rooney and Judy Garland musicals of the Thirties.The leading actors try their best with a shallowly-written script, but nonetheless Ruffalo's Dan comes across as someone entirely responsible for his own decline due to impatience and a fondness for alcohol. Knightley's Gretta is a passive figure, although apparently a talented song-writer, and she really cannot sing.Yet the potential for character-development is set aside in a film with far too many unmemorable musical numbers for its own good. On several occasions viewers yearn for the singing to end and the plot to resume.There remain one or two incidental pleasures: Carney's use of New York locations communicates something of the city's infinite riches, although we could have done without the clichéd sequence in Times Square. James Corden rehearses his familiar role of a bouncy best friend (in his pre-LATE LATE SHOW incarnation).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Different Kind of Feel-Good Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you're in to see this movie with hopes of getting a deep story of how things will progress, then you're clearly watching it for the wrong reason. From the trailers itself, it was obvious that the film will have a simple plot, yet holds a promise for a successful soundtrack. The real challenge for the filmmakers was to make this simple plot an enjoyable one, and they pretty much nailed it. The technique they used to show how the characters' paths meet, from their individual stories, is underrated. And while it teased our romantic hearts into thinking there's a love story to be expected somewhere along the way, I commend the fact that the writers didn't give in to the demands of romanticism which could have possibly categorized this as a romance film, when it clearly isn't supposed to be. Another underrated fact about this film is that it shed some light on how the music industry transforms different artists. When applied in the real world setting, this film speaks volumes of whom artists let themselves become when fame hits them.The music in this film is what brought it to success. If you're gonna judge it based on the story, then look into the background stories that inspired each song to their fruition. Watch this and see that the songs you'll find here are magic, and are sure to linger in your heart.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Lost Stars" won awards for a reason</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Begin Again is a warm and happy Indie music video lasting nearly 2 hours. Nothing about that is bad in the slightest. This film features the best acting I have seen from Mark Ruffalo in his career (closely rivaled by Spotlight in my personal opinion) and you learn to really care for his character. Keira Knightley is also the best I have ever seen her, and has a much more beautiful voice than I expected from the Pirates of the Caribbean star. This film also features some passable acting by Adam Levine of Maroon 5. He was not the greatest actor in the film by any means, however, he holds his own remarkably well. The only negatives in this film for me was the cameo of a certain celebrity musician that solves several problems from afar for our heros in the film. This felt somewhat cheap to me, as the crime of convenience is one of my biggest pet peeves in cinema. At the end of the day, the strength of this film is the remarkable soundtrack. The music in this film is spectacular, and if you love music and movies "Begin Again" is worth a watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It works in quiet ways</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mark Ruffalo is great as a down and out music producer, a believer in independent music and co-founder of his own label, but who loses his job because of his excessive drinking. He's divorced with a teenage daughter, and feels her (and his ex-wife's) disrespect for him grow as he sinks to rock bottom. The scene where he stumbles across Keira Knightly, an aspiring young singer-songwriter performing solo in a small bar, and in his mind adds the music which could accompany it, is very nice; she thinks she's bombed based on the tepid reaction from the audience in the bar, whereas he sees her talent and begins pursuing her. Her boyfriend is Adam Levine, who has already become a successful artist, though they fight when he steals one of her songs for his album. It's a scene played quite well by both of them.The movie has a nice soundtrack, including "Coming Up Roses" by Keira Knightly and "Lost Stars" by Adam Levine. Knightly is good as a singer and Levine and CeeLo Green (in a smaller role) are good as actors, and Hailee Steinfeld, Ruffalo's character's daughter, is a solid young talent. The movie has an authentic feel to it, with shots in New York City's subways and streets that I enjoyed. It moves towards an ending which is mostly predictable I suppose, but in a heartfelt way, and with a few digs at the music industry along the way. It's not a masterpiece or anything, but it works in quiet ways.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Movie Review: 'Begin Again'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Begin Again' veers away from the formulaic boy-meets-girl love story. Instead, it exposes the characters' love affair with music. As Gretta (Keira Knightley), Dave (Adam Levine), and Dan (Mark Ruffalo) navigate their lives through the lens of distance and heartbreak, their songs motivate them to move on.The movie's charm draws on director John Carney's ability to add melodic touches to the storytelling with a solid suite of songs. Using Keira Knightley's raw vocals was a good call as it only revealed more about her character. Gretta is an old-school singer-songwriter who belongs to that rare breed of musicians who are still passionate about the craft. It's refreshing to see the movie explore the heart, brain, and brawn behind good music. Lyric lovers will surely appreciate all the elements of the film.</fullReview>

Also, the idea of her as a singer kind of rankled for me, as I felt as if the role could have been given to someone with genuine a musical background rather than an A list star who just happens to be able to sing. That said, I was bracing myself for hating the 'music' part of the movie, so was pleasantly surprised to discover all of Gretta's songs were wonderfully written, quirky and delicate rather than poppy over-produced crap that would have been incidental to the plot. I adored the idea of music recorded with a background of city sounds, and loved seeing how the 'band' formed so organically and the individual characters of the musicians. That part felt very real for me, and was massively entertaining to watch.Ruffalo's enthusiastic, weathered Dan was a warm, sweet-hearted lead, who just unfolded like a flower as the movie went on; starting out as a slightly unsympathetic stubborn jerk and ending as a man who'd discovered the joy of life. I loved that the moments of tenderness between him and Gretta never moved into romance, but instead realistically portrayed the very special connection made with someone who helps you grow and change. My heart ached during the scenes when they walked the city at night - sharing Gretta's playlist - because to meet someone like that and share such a special evening is a moment that sometimes only happens once in a lifetime.Such a touching, joyful film and one most musicians I know would love.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>'Begin Again' Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you love movies about music, filled with original songs from beginning to end, then you'd love "Begin Again." Mark Ruffalo plays Dan, a record producer who gets fired and lives estranged from his wife and daughter. Greta, played by Keira Knightley, is a musician who just said goodbye to love. When Greta's music attracts the ears of Dan, they decide to make music together, recording live sessions around the city of New York.It's a comedy-drama movie that promotes second chances, tied together with original songs. Many parts of the movie are combined with heartfelt moments, some of which are backed up by laughter. You'll love this movie, you'll love the songs, and it will surely touch your heart - and your ears!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie 'Begin Again' is an American musical comedy drama released in 2013. John Carney who had a huge success through the movie 'Once' directed and wrote the whole movie. The story was partly inspired by his own experiences as a musician in a band. Adam Levine of Maroon5,Keira Knightly and Mark Ruffalo are the leading actors. They began filming in July 2012 in various locations around New York City. It is a great movie showing the beauty of the city with music.An independent songwriter 'Gretta James'(Keira Knightly) moves to New York because her boyfriend 'Dave Kohl'(Adam Levine) gets a contract with a major music company. However, Gretta gets dumped by her boyfriend so she moves out right away. Later on a formerly successful record label executive 'Dan Mulligan'(Mark Ruffalo) being fired from his job encounters Gretta in a bar and asks her to make an album with him. They produce a street band and start singing and recording in the streets of the city to make their own album together.Begin Again was filmed in several locations that show the distinct characteristics of New York;By the lake of Central Park, a rooftop overlooking the Empire state building, China town, and the subway. The city is like a huge character of this movie. Every time the band starts playing music in the street, a number of the camera angles shows various scenery of the city that you couldn't have seen anywhere from other movies. It includes the realistic sounds of the field, so it gives an impression of traveling through the city. John Carney elaborately made an effort to show the beauty of New York so he actually traveled the city to decide where to do the filming. Also, the soundtrack of the movie is great. As the director is famous for his previous music drama, he portrays love and the feelings of the characters through music. All the songs are very appealing and were very popular for a long time.New York is known as a big dreary city but in this movie it changes to a very peaceful place through the music. The music stuck in my head so I couldn't get over the warm feeling that comes from the movie. This is the kind of movie that gives you a smile and puts you in a good mood.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Begin Again (2013)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I enjoy watching this film. It is one of the best of 2014 ? one of the best films ever. It always brings about feelings of nostalgia of the time when it came out. It's funny because although I was interested in seeing it at the time of its release, it was basically because of it being an antidote to the current summer blockbusters. I had no idea it would hit me as hard as it has. To sum it up it is essentially a film of people recording an album on the streets of New York. There are a lot of other things going on beyond that but that is ultimately what the film is. It is like a love letter to New York City and a compelling look into the lives of the characters. It always takes me back to the summer of 2014. It was playing in theaters as I was starting anew and there is a summery feel to it. Music is a big part of the movie so it helps to be music knowledgeable. The thing I love about a lot of the music is that it doesn't cater to popularity. One may consider that the music in this film may be targeted towards hipsters, or something to that effect, but I honestly feel it is more genuine than that. Keira Knightley sings beautifully on songs such as Lost Stars, A Step You Can't Take Back and Tell Me If You Wanna Go Home. I love the musical interlude during that song. I also love the scene when she sings Like a Fool. Most notably is Coming up Roses; it is during a daytime scene when the musicians are recording it in a back alley. Another noteworthy scene is when For Once in My Life by Stevie Wonder is playing as Keira Knightley and Mark Ruffalo are walking around and through Times Square. Another highlight is the song A Higher Place sung by Adam Levine. He, too, is exceptional. It is a wonderful film. It would be worth having; including the soundtrack.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Begin Again is a film by John Carney, the creator of the phenomenal Once (2006), which has again set foot on its familiar ground music. While Once is set in the green of Ireland, the plot of this film is moved across the Atlantic to New York. Here we have a once successful, now divorced, alcohol intoxicated music producer Dan and Greta, young singer-songwriter who came from England to give her support to her boyfriend Dave, whose sudden success pulls radical decisions, and one of these is to move to America. As it happens, at the moment of total emotional distress Dan accidentally hear Greta sing and feels the energy. The main difference between Once and Begin Again the use of flashbacks, the most famous are certainly the two from the first third of the film that seeks to explain how this is to their "fatal" encounter occurred. Musical numbers are creatively designed to the streets and more remote areas of New York overlooking the example. I have to agree with many criticisms regarding the end of the film, which seems to be directed by someone else, though, I do agree that does not spoil the overall impression.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shocked by how great this film was</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I picked this up yesterday on sale as I never heard of it before and since I love music I said to myself I might as well see what its about. The film which was originally called Can A Song Save Your Life before it was changed to Begin Again sees a down on his luck drunk named Dan played by Mark Ruffalo from 13 Going On 30)who's marriage is on the rocks and his daughter played by Hailee Steinfield dresses inappropriately for her age.Of course Dan ends up being sacked from his job as a music producer and one night stumbles on an open mic session where he hears a young woman singing. Turns out that this young woman is Gretta (played by Kiera Knightly from Pirates Of The Caribbean)who's friend Steve(played by James Corden from Into The Woods)suggested Gretta to sing live causing her to get noticed by Dan. So Dan takes Gretta under his wing and decides to make her into a star by making music videos and everything for her to make it to the top again. Of course Gretta stopped singing for a long time having split up with her partner Dave Grohl(played by Maroon 5 frontman Adam Levine in his film debut)as she was a singer/songwriter too just like Dave(as we see this in a flashback)and she decides to make it big again.Overall this film is a must see for music lovers,the acting was very good,Mark Ruffalo was terrific as the drunken washed up disgraced music producer who swears quite a lot,Kiera Knightly was very good as Gretta(more on Knightly in a minute)and the rest of the film was very good. The singing by Kiera Knightly I must say is brilliant,who knew that she had a beautiful singing voice and she plays the guitar very well too. I was shocked by how good she was in this movie. Between Kiera and Zachary Levi(who shocked me in Tangled when he sung in that film, as well as the likes of Hugh Jackman,James Marsden etc all these guys should seriously just release an album as they all have fantastic singing voices). Bottom line I really enjoyed it and if you haven't seen it yet then please do.Thumbs Up GoodB-</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Maybe super music enthusiast will really enjoy this movie. I thought it was pretty good, since it has good music and good story. But it just wasn't this amazing movie I was expecting. It does have heart though, and the focus on how music can connect and bring people together was touching to watch. I liked the raw and realistic direction this movie takes. All the actors and actresses was really good and really poured their hearts into this movie. They sold me as people that are really really into music. It was a heartfelt movie that involves music and passion, but it wasn't to the point where it left a mark for me. However the main aspect I liked about this movie is the conflict of interests in a relationship and how the characters deal with it. I thought that was played very well.7.3/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a splendid date flick for hipsters in the built-up areas</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From Irish director/writer John Carney (also the of the indie dark-horse ONCE (2006, 8/10), BEGIN AGAIN is an urban symphony of NYC, stars two bankable names of Knightley &amp; Ruffalo. Originally titled CAN A SONG SAVE YOUR LIFE?, which is more literal to describe the chance meeting between Dan Mulligan (Ruffalo) and Gretta James (Knightley), Dan is a damaged good, with the usual trappings, a middle-aged man abandoning himself to alcohol, separated with her wife Miriam (Keener) and distanced with their teenage daughter Violet (Steinfeld), once a promising executive of an indie record label, but now he is just fired by his business partner Saul (Bey) in the presence of Violet. It is the worst day of his life, and he is seriously considering to end his own life until he watches Gretta performing her own song in a bar, he is immediately attracted by her unsophisticated frankness in her music, and decides to sign her (although this is not up to him and he brings her to Saul to see if they can reach for a record deal).For Gretta, the day they meet is assumed to be her last day in NYC, the next day she would fly back to Britain, her homeland. She has experienced a breakup with her long-time boyfriend and songwriting partner Dave Kohl (Levine), who has become a big shot in the city and cheated on her. When Saul is hesitate to sign her, Dave proposes a crack idea to live-recording an entire album al fresco, they recruit a band and then record songs in an alley, on a rooftop and various other locations. The two grow closer and a budding romance is appositely honed up when they share each other's personal play-lists while wandering on the street, yet, Carney calmly puts a stop in this corny route through Gretta's realisation that it would only be a fling between them, and obviously Dave is still hankering to reconcile with Miriam and they should be a happy family. Meanwhile, Gretta also needs to figure out the mess with Dave, who is remorseful for his wantonness and intends to win her back after Gretta leaves him a song in his voice-mail. After witnessing Dave's live performance of LOST STARS (Oscar-nominated!), which is written by Gretta, in front of an enchanted audience, she finally has the epiphany that she cannot be a part of Dave's new rock star lifestyle, a painful closure seems to be the right thing to do. Finally, their album is accomplished, but Gretta opts for an alternative distribution circuit, she decides to sell the album in 1$ exclusively through internet, and it turns out to be a smash while Dave and Miriam reconnect their romance. Although the success of the album is a bit implausible and only can happen in a fanciful mind, otherwise the original soundtrack would become a much more sought-after commodity, apparently, one must love the soundtrack to take this film as a guilty pleasure, nevertheless, it is definitely a soothing experience to see Knightley in her most relaxed state against an always-unobjectionable Ruffalo, and it is a splendid date flick for hipsters in the built-up areas - we are all lost stars, a speck of dust within the galaxy, trying to light up the dark.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Companion Piece to "Once"!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It was pure coincidence recently, when I got out my DVD of "Once" and made my annual viewing, that I realized this movie was on Showtime- director John Carney's follow-up to that movie (other than "Zonad"-OMG- had NO idea he also did that crazy film??!). And like it's predecessor, it's a winner!Also like "Once", the music is the real star of the show. Both of these films are what I like to call "hybrid musicals". They're not your traditional musicals where the characters break out in song out in the open, and the imagined music in their heads in glaring. These "hybrid musicals", the songs are performed by the characters- with instruments, but they fuel the story along in a similar way to a traditional musical. The story of this film was inspired by "A Star is Born" with Mark Ruffalo as a down-on-his-luck former famous recording producer, who stumbles across a struggling musician in a nightclub (Knightly- who I believe was doing her own singing in this, but as I was watching this, I actually thought it was NOT her-??). He then takes her under his wing as he tries to guide her music to internet success in the midst of juggling the lives of his ex-wife and teenage daughter- Catherine Keener and Haley Steinfeld (the 2010 "True Grit" remake). Mos Def co-stars as his former partner, who still runs/owns the firm they created together, and Adam Levine has what I believe is his first film role. Big thumbs up for this one!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this film flying from Italy to the US and absolutely fell in love with it. I love Mark Ruffalo and Keira Knightly in this film. The energy and MR's quirky delivery makes this just a fun and moving film to watch. I'm just a new huge fan of Mr. Ruffalo and I really think Keira Knightly delivers a moving and very subtle performance in this film. For anyone who is an artist or considers themselves an artist, staying true to why you are in this business is a really tricky thing.This film explores this and asks the question of every artist, "why are you doing this?" Also it explores how every complicated it is to maintain healthy and strong relationships in a business devoted, it seems, to an abundance of butt kissing and star making. The fact that the main character, in the face of potential stardom, chooses to remain true to her art is a testament to the craziness of the entertainment business. Remaining true to your art can mean remaining poor! LOL! It's an odd thing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I, as a big fan of Maroon 5, came here to watch the movie out of love/respect for Adam Levine. But of course, I was in for a treat, as this movie was just adorable, I enjoyed it throughout, not just for Adam. Although Adam really did act well, and at the end in the concert he displays such harsh emotion, it's amazing.And generally, just a good movie. It's sweet, sad, funny, romantic... has good music. I would recommend it for anyone who wants to pass some time in an enjoyable way, and I am personally left emotional by it, maybe even wanting a little more (the ending felt a little abrupt to me), but that's life.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Schmaltzy and predictable, but reasonably enjoyable.The story of a washed-up music producer/executive (played by Mark Ruffalo) who discovers a singer-songwriter (played by Keira Knightley). Follows how they then set about getting her music recorded and released.Fairly conventional rag-to-riches (maybe...) storyline. Not too much originality in the plot (except for the recording locations). Overly sweet story too. However, character engagement is good, the music isn't bad and there are some funny moments too.Mark Ruffalo gives a solid performance in his role. However, I didn't really buy Keira Knightley as a singer. Her performance was fine, and the chemistry between her and Ruffalo was great, but she just didn't seem right for the part. Good support from Katherine Keener and Hailee Steinfeld, who showed us that her performance in True Grit wasn't a once-off: she is certainly a superstar in the making.Much musical star-spotting to be had in the supporting roles: Adam Levine (of Maroon 5), Yasiin Bey (Mos Def), Cee Lo Green. Their names alone add a large degree of credibility and respectability to the movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Quirky, light-hearted and simplistic to a fault, despite screaming to be likable and sweat the movie ends up being a light mess that had me actually a little angry when I thought back about it. All the mistakes it mad were easily avoidable, but it fell into them and became an average romantic film, instead of being something particular.For every positive point I think about "Begin Again" a negative immediately takes its place and even though it isn't what I wanted because I really wanted to like this movie, that's the way it went down. I have to point out that despite all the flaws I'll list ahead I had a kind of good time, especially because of the music that had really high production value and quality and surely because of the comedic aspects of the film; it definitely had success in making me laugh. So, the film starts out fairly strong, it never ever had me hooked or really interested in any of the characters, but the first and first-half of the second acts had a really good flow to them. Unfortunately after the movie hits a little over mid-way point is simply starts to crumble down piece by piece and gets what could have been a 7.5 to a 6. It becomes overly sentimental and messy, but moreover the more the film goes on the more it approaches the world in a totally surreal way and keeps trivializing reality with a light-heartiness that became annoying. Most importantly, "Begin Again" is a total failure in fact of clichés. It chooses to avoid the one that could have worked and uses the totally wrong and out of context ones.Now to the cast: the first thought that came to mind when I read the cast list was "wow, impressive" and they certainly are and all used in good ways, no one has highlights but no one has weaknesses and they all contribute to th . Except for one. Many have talked about the two leads' chemistry. Whist I may mildly agree that they work together well I thought that Keira Knightly was totally miss-cast. I am not a Knightly hater, I actually think she really has some acting chops, but from frame one of this movie I never bought her as her character until the end. It's not really because of her performance, which isn't anyway extraordinary, but I really didn't see her fit in this role. On the contrary Mark Ruffalo was very good and worked really well, even if the material wasn't top notch.I think this could have been a much better movie, but still it had its moments and fun.</fullReview>

There's something irresistible about the clichéd concept of the artist sticking it to the recording studios and doing things their way. It's a slick production but it created the feel of an indie creation and the music is actually quite good.Keira Knightley and Mark Ruffalo are strong as the leads. Beyond them the supporting cast is weak. Adam Levine is dull as Knightley's partner. James Corden is typecast. Hailee Steinfeld is OK as the sullen teenager.The plot is a bit narrow. We follow the hastily put together band through their recording of an album outdoors but there's not much in the way of setbacks or problems so it doesn't ever engage the heart.Like I said, it's all very cute but it's difficult to find much to say by way of praise beyond that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great soundtrack and good performances make up for the story's flaws</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Begin Again tells the story of a hapless music producer at the end of his rope and his discovery of a broken hearted indie musician who has raw talent and a bit of a mouth on her. Starring Mark Ruffalo and Keira Knightley, Begin Again has no shortage of talent both on and off screen but the film's story is a jumbled and incoherent mess told in very jolting ways that almost seem as if they were meant to confuse the audience. Written and Directed by Once's John Carney, the film suffers from narrative flaws much like his previous film but has enough charisma to carry us through to the finish line. Begin Again has the look and feel of indie just with a big budget cast and Adam Levine doing the soundtrack. It is really well done in regards to the look and feel of the film but it has a hard time telling its story and becomes muddled in its third and final act which almost crumbles the film if it wasn't for Ruffalo and Knightley. Like I said, the performances in this film are actually really good considering it is packed full of pop stars. Levine does a fine job playing himself in this film, a pretentious musician with a voice unlike any other. Cee Lo Green makes an appearance but ultimately feels more like a plot device than an actual real character in the film. Mark Ruffalo as Dan is a blast to watch, he is a complete jerk but in a way that you can't help but love him. His fast paced way of telling it how it is between clove cigarettes and sips of a flask is nothing short of enjoyable. Carney's screenplay is an absolute jumbled mess and if it wasn't for the excellent soundtrack and montages that accompany the music, I'd probably give it a lower rating. The characters are well written, the dialog was outstanding but the overall structure of the story is poorly done. Carney has a hard time with transitions here, and his editing choices are questionable to say the least. Hard cuts in the middle of scenes, and sudden jumps in time make for a very jumbled experience that could have been saves if it was just edited with a bit more finesse. Despite this, it is still a fresh take on the musical genre and does resemble Carney's previous film Once but this film has a bit more of a lighter feel to it than that. Overall, Begin Again is a jumbled mess saved by two great performances from Mark Ruffalo and Keira Knightly along with an awesome soundtrack.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Enjoyable movie that highlights the art of music and how it is a fundamental key to ever lasting memories.The title is strange as I personally thought the story with two completely contrasting situations, one washed up music executive who was still trying to bring art to the masses and a talented shy music writer who couldn't portray the songs she was writing to an audience due to her inability to break her introverted shell.What impressed me the most was the desire to bring the raw sounds to the an album so it has the "real" feel to it, in some cases it was a tad contrived but that made good entertainment. There is a tad Lorde, Sia and Angus and Julia Stone to it and if thats not your cuppa tea then you will not only not like the movie. So this is where it is all at the music, I loved Adam Levine music and overall the soundtrack was original and sensational.Some of the acting could have improved, however it didn't stop me from enjoying this movie.Simple story .... great music .... nice casting, so its a 7.5 which means i recommend you spend some of your time to see.</fullReview>

Almost all of which is terribly lackluster but for one scene. None of it would I put on and give my full attention to. None of it grabbed me -- it played like pablum, seemingly crafted not to offend anyone. I found it really quite dull. Come on! A film about music should have great songs. Sadly, in this effort, there are none of those, IMHO. Where was its "Falling Slowly?"Watchable, sweet, and forgettable.

		<fullReview>If you are looking for a feel-good movie, you have found one to see. It's a movie about friendship, about failures and new beginnings, about solidarity, about second chances, about life. It's also about love, and what I liked most was the total absence of trite sentimentalism, which would have ruined the meaning and sense of the story, where feelings are never made explicit, but simply flow along with the music played and sung in the corners of New York. And what new, what else can be said about this unique city?: still full of hope, full of life, still the place nurturing the dreams of men and women, and even where an album can be recorded en plein air. I liked the warm and heartwarming atmosphere and the settings, I also liked the songs, which are never obtrusive and manage to communicate how music can shape and even change people and things. As far as acting, Mark Ruffalo really steals the show, thanks to a strong and biting performance, Keira Knightley does her good job as an actress and as a singer, as well. On the whole, a truly enjoyable, fresh picture, making one feel like being there?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Begin Again is a pleasant, but not very memorable, film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The main risk in a film about the process of musical creation is the fact that the music isn't as good as the screenplay supposes so. Unfortunately, that's the case with Begin Again. The songs from Gretta and Dan, the main characters, are pleasant and honest, but they never reach the necessary degree of greatness in order to convince us on her talent as a composer, or his magic vision as a producer. But nevertheless, Begin Again works reasonably well because of its narrative; and even though the music isn't particularly brilliant, it works as an attractive accompaniment (and occasionally catalyst) of the human drama. And then, we have the solid performances from the whole cast, starting by Mark Ruffalo and Keira Knightley, who are completely credible as two "lost souls" seeking for a new sense in their lives, which they might find sharing a creative project. Catherine Keener and Hailee Steinfeld also bring honest and detailed works as Dan's wife and daughter (respectively). Adam Levine (the singer from Maroon 5) plays the character of Gretta's unfaithful husband, but he took the good decision of not portraying him as a monster, but as a typical rock star who was a victim of his own success. I don't like Levine's music band, but he has shown talent as an actor in this movie. In conclusion, I found Begin Again entertaining and pleasant, but forgettable and superficial. I can give it a moderate recommendation as an inoffensive weekend distraction, but if you want to see brilliant films about musical creation, I recommend you Once (whose director, John Carney, was the same one from Begin Again) or Phantom of the Paradise.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rough around the edges but thoroughly charming.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's been a while since Irish filmmaker and bassist John Carney has graced the spotlight. 2007's low-budget Once was a real treat and earned itself a thoroughly deserved Oscar for its memorable song "Falling Slowly." It feels like Carney's trying to repeat the magic here with an Americanized but not-much-bigger-budget version with Begin Again with A-list stars Keira Knightley and Mark Ruffalo. They're a welcome here as their screen presence overcomes clunkiness in the production. Too often does the photography feel sloppy and unplanned with illogical blocking and no texture. But Begin Again isn't a film concerned with looks, it's all about the music and the artists.After struggling with an inexplicable nonlinear structure, feeling obligated to give us backstory whilst being overexcited at getting to the meat and indulging in that first in its prologue, it finally finds its stride. With our protagonists paired and the concept taking the reigns, it's pretty easy going stuff to just witness happening after such a slow pace, though it still gives us backstory to other characters. In fact, you end up dreading the inevitable downfall and sincerely hope the landing isn't too harsh after the hardships we tread through with them before. The music here is nothing particularly special, but it has an authenticity and a heart that shines through. It may be on-the-nose, but it adds so much to the characters and atmosphere to the air. Such great moments such as the performance on the rooftop when Hailee Steinfeld joins in the band.Knightley is radiant and tender, with only a few misteps where she slips into clichés that don't suit the character. Ruffalo's rugged nearly-homeless feel meets groans initially, but he rubs off on you and becomes the film's firm backbone. Maroon 5's Adam Levine sounds alarm bells at first but he's actually okay, performing music that's closest to his roots when his band was actually listenable. At least he's self-deprecating in the role making him somewhat endearing. British comedian James Corden is the antidote to any ills the film may have though. Begin Again may be rough around the edges and flawed, but it's a thoroughly charming film with a big heart. Its emotion works, but really it's mostly nice to see films of this topic. It may not exactly be Inside Llewyn Davis but it's more therapeutic company.7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Summer music in the air</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Quickie Review:Dan (Mark Ruffalo), a record label executive is forced to quit his company after being unwilling to compromise on the integrity of the music he produced, for higher sales. Meanwhile, Gretta (Keira Knightley) is a young songwriter cheated on by her college sweetheart Dave (Adam Levine), who is consumed by his new rock-star status. Gretta and Dan meet each other by chance, and the two of them become partners to produce an album to the sounds of Manhattan. Begin Again is a charming little movie about redemption, friendship, and of course music. It is filled with likable characters, witty dialog, and is in the end an uplifting story. While I can't say the movie is original, the chemistry between Ruffalo and Knightley alone was enough to make me enjoy it overall.Full Review:The director of Begin Again, John Carney, had previously directed another music focused movie called Once, which I really loved. So for that reason, I was excited to see his latest work. While it doesn't live up to his previous film, Begin Again is still worth a watch.The stand out performance for me is Mark Ruffalo. From the first scene it is obvious that his character Dan, is not exactly well put together. He is lazy, messy, an alcoholic, also he comes late to meetings and has damaged relationship with his daughter and separated wife. Yet it is his passion for music that shows that there is much more to this man. And he feels the same way about Gretta, that there is a talent that he sees in her that must be shown to the rest of the world. They find a kindred spirit in each other as they work together on the music album. An aspect I love about this movie, is that it is not a love story, or at least in the typical romantic movie sense. Carney could have taken the obvious easy route and just made this a romantic story of Dan and Gretta. Instead it focuses on all the other relationships the two leads have with the supporting cast. In that sense the way the story deals with love between characters is pleasantly charming and unique because it can't be easily labeled.As it is music oriented, I should of course comment on that. Just like movies, music is very subjective, so I won't say that everyone will enjoy the music in this movie. I personally like indie rock so Begin Again soundtrack was a perfect fit for me. If it so happens that you don't enjoy such music, I can at least assure you that the actors involved have a good voice, of course Adam Levine is no surprise in that matter. I should mention though that Levine surprised me with his acting talent. He is no thespian, but he was very natural in his delivery, so props to him.My main problem with this movie is that I feel like I have seen this all before. There is very little risk taken, and you know exactly what is going to happen. So it ends up being that the whole entertainment factor lands on the characters and the dialog. Thankfully, these two aspects is where Begin Again excels and saved the movie. If you are looking for a smart, charming, summer feel-good movie, this is the one for you.Check out more on my movie review blog The Stub Collector: http://thestubcollector.wordpress.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Loving glances</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Begin Again is a sweet movie about the fragility of love. How it can be there one moment and gone the next. Gretta (Keira Knightley) and Dave (Adam Levine) were bound together with the struggle to make it in the music world and mutual infatuation. Suddenly Dave makes it and moves on while leaving Gretta behind. In comes in Dan (Mark Ruffalo) and sees potential in her music. Dan has his own love troubles and dealing with a stagnant career as a music executive. Dan is the ultimate "Mr. Nice Guy". Lots of loving glances and creative innocence is experienced on the big screen and this tale is about self discovery and the complexity of dealing with change. Regardless of what life throws at you, you got to believe in your dreams and move forward because in the end it all works out. Overall it is a feel good movie of the normal lives of regular folks who are struggling to make it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good story about musicians and a producer, but will probably appeal only to music lovers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Begin Again was fairly enjoyable but I think only musicians and music fans will be able to identify with it. Greta, a budding songwriter, moves to New York City with her boyfriend and songwriting partner Dave, who has just made it as a musician. His affair with a producer leaves her reeling and she contemplates leaving the city. One night at a bar, she is spotted by Dan, a struggling record label executive who offers to sign her on. She refuses at first, not wanting to compromise her musical independence, but changes her mind the next day. They meet Dan's partner, who is unimpressed but agrees to reconsider if they can provide a demo tape. Dan pulls together a team of musicians, and they record an album at various locations around the city. Dan and Greta help each other face their respective personal problems and the film ends with them both making a fresh start.Songs and various ideals in music (e.g. staying true to the original emotion/intention of a piece) play a large part in driving the plot forward and shaping the characters' actions. Not being deeply into music myself, this was something I couldn't really appreciate, but I can imagine that those who are will find the film appealing. None of the songs left a deep impression either. Nevertheless, I think the story has a ring of truth to it. We see three different music industry types: fiercely independent musician who hates commercialisation (Greta), artist willing to compromise his music for popularity (Dave), plus visionary and resourceful label executive (Dan). The acting was pretty good all round and I was pleasantly surprised to find that Keira Knightley can sing. So while the movie probably is good, I think it only appeals to people who are really into music.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Awfully fake for a movie about authenticity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>FINALLY gave in and watched the movie Begin Again. The soundtrack promised that it would be disappointing, but still I hoped for something that vaguely resembled Once... Alas, Begin Again is a movie that makes big claims about "real art" but understands "art" about as much as a shoe. The one thing it does have in common with Once is that Carney ripped the beginning line/melody of Hansard's "All the Way Down" ("you have broken...") in the song "Like a Fool." When I saw that they gave Glen Hansard some "writing credits," the only thing I could imagine is that they were forced to pay him retroactively for this line that they stole because Hansard's music has nothing in common with the music in this emotionless movie. Why is Knightley singing like a cute little bird even when she is supposed to be singing an "F- U" song to her ex? The whole movie made me extremely annoyed, though I wanted to like it - the beginning scene that felt forced (look a girl can play a guitar - isn't that super original?), the 0 chemistry between Ruffalo (a usually fantastic actor) and Knightley, the scattered plot with weirdly timed flashbacks, and the constant message that this movie was supposed to be about authenticity when it was decidedly fake!!! Don't bring in a Maroon 5 singer if you want real music. It boggles my mind that John Carney wrote this script after writing Once. The only explanation I have is that Glen Hansard and Marketa Irglova provided the heart to Once whereas neither Ruffalo nor Knightley had the knack for music to do so for Begin Again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Great Surprise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really didn't expect much from this film. I figured it might be a bit of a side project for Ruffalo and Knightley while they were both more concentrated on Foxcatcher and The Imitation Game. The inclusion of Adam Levine in an acting role also rang alarm bells.However, I could not have been more wrong. I thoroughly enjoyed every minute of this film. The relationship between the two main characters is brilliant but the real star relationship that I enjoyed was the re-connection of Ruffalo's character to his estranged daughter (played brilliantly by Hailee Steinfeld). The two of them capture a very accurate attritional relationship between an angsty teen and a failing father.This is a lovely, feel-good, indie film that gives us an insight into a cross section of the music industry. The film is so well cast that these characters really gel and you can feel the differing relationships between them. The film does all this without falling into classic rom-com stereotypes and disengaging the audience.It is so refreshing to see a film genuinely explore character relationships without feeling the need to force any romance story lines.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As I am writing this Lenoard Nemoy died. Just as Star Trek took us to imaginary space continuum, this film takes us to space continuum of New York music scene. I would say non existent scene, because I never cool people like that when I lived in NYC. Although, I did live there for a short period of time, may be times have changed.I truly enjoyed this film. I enjoyed cool, casual plot. I enjoyed the music. I enjoyed cool, casual acting. I really succeeded in relaxing while watching this film. That is a rare occurrence for me, since they make tense and visual effects filled films these days. These relaxing, art oriented film are more rare these days. Too bad! I strongly recommend that you watch this film, especially if you like relaxing, good music filled films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I only saw it because MArk Ruffalo was in it. He always brings great things to each role. I was expecting nothing from the movie, but maybe some good songs. It was refreshingly low key and real. To be perfectly clear I am not a musician and don't know the intricacies of singing/recording. I just enjoy music and listen to a lot and know the sounds I enjoy, So it may be not great singing/music, but I enjoyed it.Love movies as well and this was very good. I loved every part of it. The acting was straight on as was the plot. There was no giant twist at the end, which I am grateful for, but the ending was surprising. Kiera's voice was surprisingly pleasing, or, at least unexpectedly. The plot and story lines were straightforward, but they threw some time- line change ups to make it interesting in the beginning.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent film on many levels</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I haven't reviewed a film on IMDb in many years, but Begin Again has so much to recommend it I had to weigh in. This movie is the definition of a pleasant surprise, with excellent acting, surprisingly good music, and a plot that doesn't give in to the typical Hollywood ending. I watched this with three couples, all 40+, and everyone loved it. It also ignited a robust and lengthy conversation about the deeper meaning of the plot... which is an almost certain sign that the film hit an emotional note with its audience. Spoiler alert! The climactic scenes leave us with a somewhat ambiguous ending, especially as it relates to the relationship between Gretta and Dave. Dave's interpretation of Gretta's song seems to make it clear to both that their differing musical visions leave them ultimately incompatible... and it appears they both recognize this. But looking at this film from a different angle shows that it also serves as a powerful metaphor for the different directions that are tearing at the music industry today, with Dave representing the high powered star making machine that emphasizes profit over artistry, and Gretta representing the indie style artist that believes that music should remain the driving motive, with the internet disintermediating the cost-laden, hit-focused legacy music industry. In the final scene at Dave's concert, they both realize that they personally, as well as the direction of the industry they each represent are both violently incompatible.No one vision of the industry is clearly right or wrong, nor is there a singular interpretation of what happened between Dave and Gretta. But it's that ambiguity that makes this such a compelling story in the first place. Make up your own mind, or just watch this for what it is... a well acted, interesting story backed by some really good music. Enjoy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Begin Again is a modern day, soul-arousing comedy that tells a tale of two lost souls, who stumble across each other and create music together.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'m a big fan of Keira Knightley. I love her in period drama's such as Pride and Prejudice and The Duchess.I think the essence of the film was delivered well by the cast. Mark Ruffalo, who plays an eccentric ex-record executive added fun to the film. I wouldn't say this film gave Keira's best performance but she was still enjoyable to watch. I thought that the music was lovely and Adam Levine's voice was as always, astoundingly beautiful. As a singer/songwriter, it definitely reminded me how much music feeds souls like mine and it made me feel like I wanted to randomly busk in the middle of the cinema just for the love of it! An enjoyable feel-good and inspiring film to watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>From the start</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Can a song save your life? Or a film about it? The former question is what the movies title originally was going to be. But lets get back to Mark Ruffalo and Keira Knightley, both of whom are exceptional in this. There is also Adam Levine (he plays sort of a version of himself or what the general public thinks of him and he's doing a great job too) and Catherine Keener.Put this cast together with a really good script, that actually avoids quite a lot of the typical romantic comedy clichés. You genuinely don't know where this is going. It might have to do that this is first a movie about music and then about human love. So it's love for music first and then the rest. It doesn't mean, it doesn't love it's character though. Quite the contrary! They are very nicely drawn, which makes this a very entertaining watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Tale of Music &amp; Redemption...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>John Carney's 'Begin Again' is a wonderful, heartwarming Tale of Music &amp; Redemption. The film balances between music, love &amp; also humor, admirably, while the performances, are fabulous. 'Begin Again' Synopsis: A chance encounter between a disgraced music-business executive and a young singer-songwriter new to Manhattan turns into a promising collaboration between the two talents.The characters in 'Begin Again' are in search for redemption &amp; they all the achieve that, through music &amp; the rhythm of life. Their journey, as people or as characters, is at times saddening, but extremely heartwarming, as well. Carney's Screenplay blends human-emotions with music, ingeniously. Carney's Direction, on the other-hand, is simplistic. Cinematography &amp; Editing are flawlessly done. A Special Mention for the melodious music throughout.Performance-Wise: Mark Ruffalo &amp; Keira Knightley, both of whom are yet awaiting a much deserved Oscar in their shelves, deliver sparkling performances. Ruffalo is natural to the core, displaying love, frustration &amp; ambition with effortless ease, while Knightley is a delight. She expresses each &amp; every emotion, so beautifully. Also, the on-screen chemistry between the two, is exciting. Catherine Keener is fantastic. Has Keener ever delivered a bad performance? Hailee Steinfeld is nicely restrained. James Corden is first-rate. Adam Levine is alright. On the whole, 'Begin Again' is a GEM. Two Thumbs Up!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't even remember the last time I watched a feel-good movie as great as this one, this is absolutely brilliant, might as well be this year's best feel-good musical movie with some great music.. No, actually, it is, without a doubt.. First of all, Keira Knightley: All the respect goes out to you for being yourself, staying as you are, and never giving in to Hollywood's pressures to change because you are just so fine as you are, lady, Hollywood needs more actresses like you :). And now we found out you can sing as well - what a valuable, lovely bonus for us! :) That's said, I watched this without much advance knowledge about it, just who made it and who was in it -no sneak peeks, no trailers, no reviews- but kind of knowing what to expect, yet what I got was still a wonderful surprise, worth every single minute of my time, how amazing is that?!.. Truly romantic, fun, and entertaining, this is a film you can really feel because it feels like it's straight out of real life with some realistic, likable characters.. Aaaah Mark Ruffalo! Who doesn't like/love this man?! Who couldn't/wouldn't?! :) He delivers a great performance here as the "once high profile, now low and drunken" music producer, and they have an incredible chemistry with Knightley (is there anyone Mark Ruffalo doesn't have a great chemistry with by the way?! He was fantastic with Matt Bomer in The Normal Heart as well :D).. Wonderful supporting performances by all: Although he wasn't in many scenes, I thought Adam Levine did make his limited screen time really count; Hailee Steinfeld was also good but all I could think during her scenes was "wow, how much she's grown since True Grit" :); James Corden was really cute as Keira Knightley's cute and cuddly, "always there" best friend - warning: he'll really make you want to have one if you don't already :); and, last but not least, the wonderful Catherine Keener, always a pleasure to watch. If you watch this at home, make sure you grab a few beers, order pizza, invite friends, loved ones, or just watch it with your bf/gf (highly recommended :)), get comfy and cosy on the sofa - warning: You'll often find yourself moving to some fantastic tunes all throughout :). Thank you for this wonderful, beautiful film, John Carney, it made my day :).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I like the acting in this movie -- everyone's quite sweet and sincere. There are some great scenes. Maybe the best thing about the film is that it doesn't go for the traditional rom-com ending. That was a bit of a surprise. However apart from that, the plot is quite predictable. Talented songwriter cum musician is dumped by her high profile boyfriend, meets new Svengali who's having a nervous breakdown himself, and they get together and make beautiful (platonic) music. Svengali heals rift with his ex-wife and troubled teenage daughter while miraculously curing his own alcohol problem. Girl finds solace with overweight and therefore platonic male friend who is prepared to do everything for her, and also provide comic relief. I guess I was in a cynical mood when I saw this film. It really is an inoffensive, light hearted picture, but it won't challenge you much.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Review: This is a sweat movie about a down and out alcoholic, music producer who hears a song in a bar and gets inspiration to make the singer famous. After getting turned down by his record producer, partner Mos Def, he decides to cut the album on the streets of New York with the help of a band, who works for free. The storyline did seem a bit jolly for my liking, but the performances were great by the whole cast, especially Mark Ruffalo. Each character brought something different to the project which made it a watchable film, but I did feel a bit empty at the end. Knightley's singing was quite impressive for a first timer, but her annoying grin and posh English accent became a bit tedious after a while. The director tried to bring some depth to the characters which all went out of the window once they went on the road, which was a shame. Anyway, it's worth a watch but it won't go down as a classic. Watchable!Round-Up: Maroon 5's lead singer, Adam Levine was a great addition to the cast and he seemed to burst into song with ease, even though it was his first starring role. Cee Lo also put in a good performance but I didn't understand why his friend started beat boxing for no reason. All the way through the film you get this tribute to New York, which I have seen in many Woody Allen and Martin Scorsese movies. Personally I think it's the stars that brought in the audiences, more than the concept because on paper, I don't think that this &nbsp;movie would have worked if the director brought in some B actors.&nbsp;Budget: $8million Worldwide Gross: $64million (WOW!)I recommend this movie to people who are into there road movies about a record producer who makes an album on the streets of New York with a first time singer. 5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Begin Again?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This might have hit me better at another point of my life, but, seriously? Sexiest Man Alive, Adam Levine, is a complete stereotypical music, artist, whatever. Why is it that writers believe this character is new? We've all seen him before. As for Keira Knightly, could we just not? I'll believe she's a lyricist just about when I start believing she was actually a factually based character on Titanic. The role would have been better acted by anyone else. ANYONE else. The ONLY redeeming factor is the acting by the talented Mark Ruffalo. He plays a believable, although again, stereotypical, down n out music exec. Drunk on his past success and with something to prove. His visualization of Knightley's song, in the bar is cinematic gold. Who cares if it's so poorly shot that you can see the arms holding the sticks. CeeLo Greene 's "free-style",off the cuff riff was cute, but out of place. CeeLo, the Yoda of music. All in all, a story that's been told, over and over. Nothing to see here. Unless you have a desire to see Adam with a bad hair cut and mustache. No reason to Begin Again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Keira Knightly shines, but otherwise it's a poor imitation of "Once"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a mixed bag - Keira Knightly, as always, brings a charisma and warmth that make almost any movie worth experiencing. Sadly, it is only her warmth and charms that kept this movie afloat through what was a lot of straining and over-efforting with pieces that did not quite succeed. The pieces were poorly done, and did not really fit together into a coherent and fluid narrative. The fails are three-fold: 1) The music. This might be just my taste, but I found it lame and flat. And rather than showing a mastery of music that takes us beneath the veneer of "pop" and commercial product we are continually sold, the writer displayed a shockingly superficial grasp of the art form. For example, when the Keira Knightly and Mark Ruffalo characters discuss the music that inspired their lives, instead of introducing us to a wonderful and delightful new paradigm of music we may not have been familiar with, all the script did was halfheartedly mention a few stiff and silly clichés.2) Ruffalo's character's behavior was really just a clown show. A fine actor, he was given a series of set pieces as if from a TV movie - and was ACTING bits of the drunken has-been on the verge of rediscovering his family and his integrity and his career, rather than someone actually living that, or doing that. His over-wrought histrionics were, therefore, clownish - unconvincing. One was completely unmoved at those empty displays of "emote-by-the-numbers." 3) Hailee Steinfeld and Catherine Keener were both rather wasted. Hailee is a very young Oscar nominee with a bright future, but her character's story arc didn't go anywhere. Her character had no spark, nothing that really set her apart as anything specific or meaningful. Similarly the older but equally appealing Catherine Keener also didn't have much to do. Aside from expressing a few standard ex-wife and "mom" concerns (she played Hailee's mother), her character didn't do much in the story. Certainly in both cases both of the women were under-used. Both of those otherwise talented and brilliant female actors could just as easily have not been in this movie - and no one would have noticed their absence, their characters had such a teensy impact. And that is the fault of the writer/director, not the actors.As the movie wound down to the final act I had an inkling that this was a limp attempt to rip-off the really great indie movie "Once." Except this did not have the spontaneity of "Once," nor the artistic musical sense of that movie. I was shocked to read, later that night, that this movie was written and directed by the same guy who did "Once." That is sad - he aimed for a repeat of his earlier success, but completely and utterly failed to capture any but the most superficial resemblance.He would have been better to have steered clear of music and any other similarities to "Once," and made a movie about welding. Or something. It could only have more interesting, more authentic, and more satisfying than this clunker.Overall it was really a "4," but the otherwise talented cast made it a "5" (even though they bombed here), and Keira Knightly's good vibes made it a "6" (even though her movies are usually 10s).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Okay, if you're watching it on Netflix</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Me and my boyfriend went to watch this movie at a theater because of a high rating on IMDb. Besides, the movie has Mark Ruffalo, so we decided to go watch this movie even though the teasers seemed cheesy to me. Although, the movie is not bad it is not entirely fulfilling either. I would recommend watching it on Netflix/ DVD on one of those days when you're bored and don't want to watch anything intense. The only saving grace in this movie is Mark Ruffalo. Without him the plot would have been even more boring. Yes, the movie is lighthearted, unconventional, and doesn't go the predictable romantic route - Yet, I felt a tad disappointed with the mere ordinariness of this movie and I didn't think it was worth the money spent.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Music interspersed with a weak plot.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Short Version: Mark Ruffalo plays Dan, a music industry has-been, and he is dumped by the label he helped found. Keira Knightley is Gretta, a musician and dumped girlfriend of Adam Levine's Dave in the film. Dan and Gretta meet in a bar when Gretta's friend prods her onto the stage to play a song she wrote, and then the pair work to produce a demo album for the rest of the movie. Dan takes on the role of Gretta's mentor, which gets a little weird when he recreates his first date with his wife with her.Dan is a rough-around-the-edges alcoholic and is on the outs with his estranged wife and daughter. Gretta is in recovery mode after Dave dumps her. Both characters are working to fix their relationship woes in the film subplots.What sinks this film is weak story drivers. Dan lost his job, but so what? We find out he's tight with Cee Lo Green not far into the movie, and Cee Lo is more than willing to help him monetarily with the album he's working on. There's no big threat looming for him: Dan's wife and daughter aren't threatening to move far away if he doesn't straighten up. The IRS isn't hounding him for back taxes, so he really needs a big score or else. Gretta is in the same boat, plot-wise. Her ex-boyfriend is a jerk, so why would she need to get back in his good graces? There's nothing driving her.Verdict: This film is maybe worth the money to watch if you only care about the music scenes. The plot behind the music is weak and drama-free, so for movie-goers looking for a real story, it might be better to avoid. That's hard to say, since I like Mark Ruffalo and Keira Knightley quite a bit.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A movie for musicians without too much unneeded emotional substance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rolling Stone continues to praise pretty much any movie out there that revolves around the music industry (most likely due to its slow departure into oblivion). This particular movie gets it right in a lot of ways though. The perspective of the musicians is true to life and the written music was nominated for an Oscar: it's some of the best songs written for a movie since Almost Famous. The recording scenes are inspiring and the musical energy is palpable to the audience. As far as the rest of the movie goes, it's has warmth and truth in the relationships with great performances--suffering mostly from an inexperienced, yet decent, screenplay writer: it is obvious that this movie was written by a musician and not a novelist. This movie is great If you're looking for a romantic comedy that's easy to watch and isn't over sexualized to make up for the lack of drama. We all love movies like this: they're cute and fun and about perseverance in dealing with inadequacy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>not good enough</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gretta is a young song writer who meets Dan, who used to own a recored company. Together, they will save each other through music. So, I think I was expecting more from it, and therefor I was slightly disappointed. The songs are good, but there are too many things going on in the movie that the film can't follow them all. The relationship between Gretta and Dan is confusing, not to mention incomplete. The story line is seriously messed up, as many things are being repeated far too many times again and again, especially at the beginning. In the end, I didn't get what the movie wanted to tell us, Dan's redemption, Gretta's resolution, their success? So I give this movie a 3 out of 10.By the way, Adam Levine is good enough as a singer, but not good at all as an actor, but James Corden is a delight.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Finding Lost Stars!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Begin Again is an original drama about finding who you are and in the process, finding a lifelong partner who can figure out that same task. In this film that question is posed against the background of music and wonderful performances. I loved the gritty tone this film gives off. The film features more of a raw sound as we explores the lives of our characters. This film may not be the best film to be released in 2014, but it's one of the more soulful films. There are some good songs, including "Lost Stars," which is beautifully sung by Adam Levine of Maroon 5 fame.John Carney's film is about a record label executive in New York City, who is struggling to keep up with the changing music industry and is in the midst of struggles with his estranged wife and daughter. While drunk at a nightclub, he is turned on by this woman named Gretta, a songwriter who broke up with her long-time boyfriend. Dan wants to sign her to a deal, but after some initial hesitation, Gretta finally agrees. Together, they embark on a journey that will change the world of music.The acting is actually quite good. We all know what a great actor Mark Ruffalo is and I think he is perfect as the man who is struggling to live life the way he wants. The main surprise is Keira Knightley. Nothing against her as an actress, but I did question her role in a film based on music. Well she can actually sing. She's no Aretha Franklin, but she can hold her own. Adam Levine does a good job as Gretta's ex, and I liked his interpretation of "Lost Stars." Overall, Begin Again is a solid movie that takes place in the New York City music scene. It's not the greatest movie, but it's still a captivating one. The film has a gritty soul and a heart, so I can appreciate the tone of the movie. I also liked the one scene where Ruffalo imagines a band playing during Gretta's acoustic performance. That took some good skill. A solid movie about finding your true self and your true soulmate.My Grade: B+</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The picture was somewhat hurt by the abrupt ending. We really don't know where the Knightley character is going when the film terminates.That being said, Mark Ruffalo is just wonderful as the music executive, down on his luck, who is fired from the firm he started. Meeting the singer Knightley at a bar begins a character study of the two as they forge a relationship which will eventually lead to success, or at least we hope it shall.Down on money, it is interesting to see how they form a band and make demonstrations of their music in various areas within the city.Nice to see Haile Steinfeld back in film as Ruffalo's daughter here after several years following her Oscar nominated turn in a remake of "True Grit."Katherine Keener, as Ruffalo's estranged wife, provides an interesting character study in rejection and ultimate return to Ruffalo's life when success is changed for the better. I would have liked to have seen her character more developed.</fullReview>

The editing and dialogue are brilliant throughout. Ruffalo and Knightley have great chemistry. What I love the most is the emphasis put on how cringeworthy and unauthentic the music industry has become. Its brilliant. Brilliant acting from Knightly.

		<fullReview>Music is such an important part of film the right score can be the difference between making a good movie and a great one. Begin again starts with the music and never lets go of it. The story and characters journeys are told through the Music more so then any of the dialogue. When a film relies so heavily on it's music that music had better be something special. In this respect begin again succeeds it's original songs strikes just the right cord. Keira knightly performance in front of the Mic is a testament to her talent as an artist. Adam Levine brings a seasoned singer to the fold and his strength as an recording artist is clear to see in the final moments of the film. Mark Ruffalos performance as the down and out producer trying to find something real to hold on to is brilliant. Ruffalo takes a situation of a man taking one last chance to succeed and makes it feel fresh and unique. Begin again will leave you feeling good and remind you not only why you love movies but why you love music too.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really did enjoy this movie, although some parts could be confusing. The way I interpret it: it is a movie about losing the guy but finding yourself, and that's what matters most! This movie has a fantastic soundtrack and for me, that made the movie 10 times more enjoyable. I listened to Lost Stars every day for two months after I saw this movie! Anyway, it's this cute, small, but touching movie, that will have you rooting for Keira Knightley. I personally didn't think it was wrong for Adam changing to mainstream pop, I think it just showed how people change over time and are no longer meant to be together. I recommend that you watch this movie, but be aware it does not have a very enthralling climax, it's a more laid-back movie!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>good but not as great as Once</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dan Mulligan (Mark Ruffalo) is a drunken executive of an indie record label. He headed A&amp;R at Island Records for 2 years before starting his own label Distressed Records with Saul Byron (Yasiin Bey). However he has been down and out for years. He's separated from his wife Miriam (Catherine Keener) and estranged from his daughter Violet (Hailee Steinfeld). He gets fired from his own label and then he sees Gretta James (Keira Knightley) performing at a bar after she's pushed onto the stage by her friend Steve (James Corden). She had come to NYC with boyfriend Dave Kohl (Adam Levine). Dave became an overnight success after his music got onto a movie. He cheated on her and they broke up right before that night at the bar.Writer/director John Carney fails to relive the same magic as his big breakout 'Once'. It would be a disservice to dismiss this movie for failing to jump that high bar. It's hard to capture magic twice especially in a similar fashion. My first opinion as I watched the movie is that Dan is from another era and Carney is past his due date. Then it turns out that Dan is actually coming from another era. His character quickly grows on me. Keira Knightley is a great actress but only an adequate singer. On the other hand, Adam Levine is the exact opposite. They're both good enough at their weaker sides to make this movie work. Their scenes together are good with Keira doing most of the heavy lifting. Keira's singing is weak but the group production is able to pump her up. James Corden adds a little fun. I was also a little hesitant about the flashbacks and forwards until the imaginary musical instruments scene. That is a wonderful touch. It's also a terrific love note to NYC.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A sympathetic musical film with the versatile and colorful New York City as a setting.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Are you really an A &amp; R man? You look more like a homeless man.""Begin Again" is a modern fairy tale in which individuals are about to make a new start in their life and (coincidentally) begin again : the start of a new career, a new relationship, a new image or simply a new personal life. The amount of films with people who are on the brink of disaster, in a desperate situation and then by a twist of fate take control again, are legion. It's the same in this with music filled feel-good movie. Only the chosen princess in this tale I personally think isn't such a success. Not a bad word about the acting skills of Keira Knightley, but the moment she starts laughing, I feel shivers going down my spine. And she laughs a lot in this film. The choice of Mark Ruffalo as the quarreling hit music producer and full time alcohol drinking future candidate clochard ,contrasts sharply with this. An endearing and beautiful rendition. Fortunately, he didn't turn green during a fit of rage.The whole story starts with an intimate and fragile performance by Gretta (Keira Knightley) in a dingy pub. She has just broken with her boyfriend, the rising star Dave Kohl (Adam Levine) who couldn't resist the temptations of his stardom and leaves his artistic better half for a female producer. Gretta is a songwriter who puts fragments of text and music on paper once and a while, trying to channel her deeper feelings in poppy sounding romantic tunes. At the same time the producer Dan (Mark Ruffalo) tries to cope with his own personal problems. He has lost his magic touch of discovering new talent and starts drinking a lot. As a result he's being sacked by his partner and co-founder of the record label. By coincidence he sits at the bar of this pub and he becomes enchanted by the song. Surrounded by a disinterested audience, he's the only one who realizes the potential of Gretta's song. And that's the beginning of the fairy tale.I've played in a band once and I was also fantasizing about the glory and fame. The attention, the innumerable people who listen to your music and know your song by heart, the number of fans who follow you unconditionally, the feelings you can produce within total strangers and the money we could earn with it. Unfortunately it remained a fantasy because we had two drawbacks: it wasn't exactly commercial music and we didn't live in the US, the country where your dreams can come true and where some poor guy can grow out into a mega-star. Dan hears Gretta's song for the first time and he's touched by the innocence and simplicity. He's the only one who can imagine how a full orchestra could support this with sophisticated arrangements and turn it into a huge hit. For me this was the most successful and imaginative scene. It demonstrates why he was a brilliant music producer. The empathy and the ability to project a simple piece of music to something grander and overwhelming. The music, in my opinion a rough mix of Suzan Vega and Birdy, isn't my favorite genre. But that didn't matter at all. It's a wonderful laid-back movie that makes you feel relaxed.Unfortunately it's a film which progress is as obvious as that Easter Monday will fall on a Monday. As the dominoes begin to fall, you can predict what direction it's going and what the final outcome will be. The music career of Gretta goes as planned, the characters who lost each other somewhere reunite irrefutable and the decisions taken are as expected. No astonishing developments or unexpected endings. A simple film which gives you a good feeling and contains a positive message. But perhaps it's because my love for music is so big and I agree with the subtly hidden complaint against the music industry nowadays, that I appreciated this film. Today it's only the commercial aspect that counts and not the emotional value. Gretta made this already clear at the beginning of the film : "Sorry, what does beauty got to do with anything? I actually just think that music is about ears not eyes ".I also admire Knightley who seemingly has sung the soundtrack by herself and she did this in a creditable way. She can, although she was out of tune a few times, still start a singing career in case Hollywood would turn its back on her. Also the supporting roles were exceptionally successful. James Corden as the helpful Steve who is musically talented, although his street performances were extremely bad. The ballad via voice mail was actually the musical highlight in this film. The endearing role played by Corden was brilliant. Hailee Steinfeld as Dan's daughter Violett, who's not satisfied with the attitude of her father, was spot on. Take a guess how that will work out ! Ceeloo Green as the savior Troublegum took care of the fun part. But mostly I was surprised by Adam Levine, front-man of Maroon 5 (Not that I knew him because it is not my type of music and I suppose it's reasonable commercial). The practical experience he gained in the music circuit was convenient I guess. I'm still wondering if the name Dave Kohl was a parody on that of the front-man of Foo Fighters. The combination of the singer with little acting experience and the actress with little singing experience was sublime. The only thing I'm sure of is that (and who has experience in sound recordings can confirm it) the recording of the demo will sound pretty lousy when you see what kind of amateurish material they used in a noisy metropolis like New York. For the rest, this was a sympathetic musical film with the versatile and colorful New York City as a setting.More reviews at http://opinion-as-a-moviefreak.blogspot.be</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Two broken souls meet, help each other stand, then run. Both are bruised artists, victims of commercialization over integrity. Keira Knightley plays the dumped girlfriend (and songwriter) of singer boyfriend, who is catching fire. Mark Ruffalo pitch perfect as music exec, once edgy, once influential, now living in failure. Exquisite location filming in New York as the two record, guerrilla style, in subway, in Central Park, in alleys. Music is quite good, by the way. Knightley sings her own. Her voice, somewhere between twee and shoegaze, is well suited to her character and songs. Not a love story, but a tale of redemption. Great date film, nevertheless.</fullReview>

This is mark Ruffalo's one of the best performances...The movie is delightful...The role of a young uptight musician from England is made to fit for Knightley known for her precautious and bashful acting.Mark Ruffalo is of course the movie's spotlight and all the songs in the movie are like a dream.....Hailee Steinfeld who plays Mark's Daughter packs a punch on her two minutes screen time! The movie opens to Gretta (Knightly) reluctantly performing a song she has composed on the insistence of her friend in a bar. Although the lyrics are beautiful the song fails to impress the crowd except for Mark, who appears electrified by the song. This scene is replayed again from Mark's perspective after a recap of his day which seems to have been one continuous downwards spiral till he stumbles upon Gretta singing in the bar. The Song is replayed this time with all the background music and acoustics as imagined by Mark and how the songs get instantly transformed must be seen to be believe...This scene will be again be replayed from Gretta's perspective after a recap of how she landed in this bar after with her breakup with her longtime boyfriend and music sensation.Lots of good performances, and songs follow, making this thoroughly enjoyable till the end..</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Super easy to watch, the only problem is that it is a movie about musicians and the love for music, but the actors didn't even know how to PRETEND they were playing - or singing. The plot has its potential, it is a very pleasant story to watch when you don't want to think much neither have that wasted-time feeling. The attention to the details could have made this movie a lot better. In some scenes, the actors appeared to be playing the guitar when there was no guitar in the song, for example. Notes all wrong, I felt bad for the bassist's attempts. The times Keira's character was clearly not singing also bothered me. Still, I enjoyed watching it and I found myself fond of Adam Levine's voice - which has never happened before. In general, this could have been a better movie. The production is good, the photography is OK, the plot is very fine. Please, actors can learn how to pretend how to play an instrument, you just have to ask them to do it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Forget the demo, let's make an album." Dan (Ruffalo) is a music executive who has fallen on hard times. His marriage is falling apart, his relationship with his daughter is strained and he drinks too much. After his drinking goes too far he loses his job and ends up at a bar wondering what to do next. When Gretta (Knightly) steps up to the mic both of their lives change for the better. Much like the movie Words and Pictures judging by the cover I was expecting a cheesy romantic comedy that has been done over and over. Much like the movie Words and Pictures I was wrong. The best way to describe this is a music version of Jerry Maguire without the love story aspect. I really like how the movie shows what is happening from more than one persons point of view. This also shows what is wrong with most of the music executives today, focusing too much on a single song rather than the artist. My favorite line of the movie is when Gretta tells Dave that his recording of the song she wrote got lost in the production of it. The movie itself is OK, a little generic but the acting and the music really make it great and I recommend this if for no other reason than for the music and the amazing ending. Keira Knightly does all her own singing and she is actually really good. Overall, a less romantic Jerry Maguire with great music and a perfect ending. I really enjoyed and recommend this.

		<fullReview>Begin Again marks John Carney's second success on the big screen, after his incredible indie-hit Once. He obviously had a much bigger budget this time around, as he was able to get some star power in Keira Knightley, Mark Ruffalo, Adam Levine, and Catherine Keener, and also filmed extensively in New York City. Despite this, he was still able to make Begin Again feel down to earth and endearing with some great music performance sequences outside around NYC. The highlight for me was Keira Knightley, she was full of infectious energy that seemed to rub off on the other actors she shared the screen with, and her musical performances were a joy to watch. Ruffalo is also great. You can see how much he enjoys the music. Adam Levine's acting is adequate, but he puts in some great singing towards the end of the film. My only complaint about the film was the NYC setting, which is probably the most cliché-ridden in film. Part of what made Once so incredible was the beauty of Dublin, which we don't get to see on film very often. Overall, I would recommend this to anyone who loves music and film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just SPOT. ON. In every way possible</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let's just get this straight: there are those of us who've are or have been extreme fans of live music, me myself since my early teens. And once you get back to your house, to your apartment, to your relationships and to your life as you know it, after being on the road in one way or the other... if you could wish for one thing to be intertwined to your everyday emotions, it would be the way you feel when you experience someone pouring his or her heart out in the form of music.There's no accurate way to fully explain the sensation of experiencing live music, as an expression of your emotions in any specific moment when it makes it all just seem real. When a building filled with unique characters find themselves connected to one another in a, by looking at it from a distance, rather cheesy and yet f*cking wonderful way. You just can't get it down in text, or rather, I can't.But you know what? This movie actually, and I'm still positively surprised and stunned while I'm writing this since it came rather unexpected, this movie has actually got IT! "Begin Again" manages to get the scenes that are about recording, and about sharing and experiencing live music, to feel utterly real in a sense that simply blows you away.Sure, there's a fair bit of cliché hiding out not far from the surface of this movie. And sure, I must admit, the scenes where you find the characters sitting by themselves could have been better. As a matter of fact, the lack of situations where the actors actually scrutinize themselves could be a little bit excruciating from time to time.But even so, I feel obliged to state this: "Begin Again" manages, even through some of it's shortcomings, to capture so much of the life that IS live music that it even works fairly well as a substitute for being out on the road. And that, my dear friends, would be enough for me to recommend this gem to anyone with a soft spot for live music.I dare you not to check this soundtrack out afterwards. That's how good this movie is. I dare you not to replay the last 20 minutes of this movie. That's how good it is. Hats of, thanks for this experience, yours truly.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A solid musical drama that takes us through the creative process of an artist</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"I just think you have let your troubles get in the way of your entire life."There is no doubt that music has a deep influence in our lives, and there is no one who expresses this better in movies than director John Carney, who has returned to the musical drama genre after his success in 2006 with Once. Begin Again is sort of a love letter for musicians and aspiring musicians as well, reminding them about the importance of not selling out and remaining authentic. This is a big part of the dramatic narrative and Carney, a former musician himself, reminds audiences that music is personal and has a different meaning for everyone. This isn't your standard rom-com because the screenplay is written in such a way that you never can fully anticipate what direction it's heading. Rather than centering on a love relationship it focuses on a work collaboration between people who are passionate for music. Somewhere along the way they got their hearts broken and lost their motivation, but a coincidental encounter brought these two characters together and set them in the right path once again. I fell in love with these characters and found it hard to resist this feel good film. The chemistry between Mark Ruffalo and Keira Knightley was special and charming. This film may have flown under many people's radar, but it is one that is worth checking out. There are plenty of authentic and funny moments while the dramatic elements are also engaging. The cinematography might not be the best we've seen, but the rich characters and charming score make up for it. Begin Again is a joyful and genuine film that pulls at your heart strings without ever feeling manipulative or clichéd. The performances are a huge part of the success of this uplifting and cheerful musical film. Mark Ruffalo has been on quite a role lately and once again he plays a rather flawed character in such a way that he still manages to remain likable for the audience. This lost musical producer seems to find his way when he encounters Keria Knightley's character in a bar one night. Knightley is fantastic as well and I felt her performance to be impressively genuine and authentic. Every scene she shared with Ruffalo felt real and the dialogue was never forced. The natural chemistry between these two is something you don't run into very often. I would go as far as saying that Knightley's performance is one of my favorite of the year. Adam Levine gives a solid performance playing this self absorbed rising star. He is a better singer, but that doesn't mean he can't act. Hailee Steinfeld has grown as a mature actress, but she has always been a force to reckon with ever since her outstanding performance in True Grit. Most Def and Catherine Keener also have solid supporting roles. Everything about this film is charming and hard to resist despite the fact that it remains small and unimportant. It's simply a feel good movie that pays homage to the influence of music in our lives, and lets us in on the creative process while at it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Strong movie with two convincing lead performances.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(Also don't read this if you want to avoid spoilers for "Once".)"Begin Again" was written and directed by John Carney, responsible for the wonderful 2006 music movie "Once" and here, with a much more prominent cast, he did not let me down either. This movie was originally intended to go by the title "Can A Song Save Your Life?" and I'm glad they changed it, as admittedly it did sound a little pretentious. "Begin Again" fits the story very well too.The first half has many leaps in time, so we see how Ruffalo's and Knightley's characters meet for the first time from their own perspectives. I liked that a lot. What I also liked was Knightley's singing, especially in these scenes when there is no orchestra or band playing. Something raw about it! Back to the scene where they meet for the first time (or I should probably say where she sings and he listens): He had a few drinks before and imagines her voice going together with a full orchestra. This was possibly the highlight of the whole movie for me. Really well done and it left a lasting impression. I wanted to swing with Ruffalo's character there.Now that I mentioned my favorite already, here is some more scenes that I deemed significant:The ending was expected, if you have seen "Once". It seems a bit of the director's trademark to pick something that the audience will not totally love, but understand. You wonder during the whole film if they get together (it probably even looked more that way in "Once" than here). I have read different interpretations here, but my thoughts were that Levine's character played the song the way she wanted him to and she sees how the audience loves that version and is deeply impressed. Obviously, we see Ruffalo's character getting together with his ex-wife again and it seems like Greta makes the same decision.One indicator is the ear-phones she sends back, which is a bit of a sign that at least their romantic relationship is gone. These played a major role in an earlier scene, where they connect by sharing their playlists and both listening them at the same time by sharing the earphones just the way Ruffalo's character did when he met his wife years ago. In the end he sits on a bench back together with his wife and these two sharing the earphones. Earlier there is a scene where he gets in a car with Greta and the wife (Catherine Keener) looks at him through the door. Later on, it is exactly the other way around. Ruffalo's character gets in the car with his ex-wife and Greta looks at the two. Nice parallel here.Adam Levine, I'm not really familiar with his music except one or two songs and I would not call him a particularly gifted actor after watching this one, but the part seemed good for him. He gave a credible performance.What stayed in mind was the Jerry Maguire quote from early on. These two are not completely the same, but actually there are a few parallels. I won't go further into detail here in order to avoid spoilers for a third movie.Hailee Steinfeld was not a highlight here. She gave a wonderful performance in "True Grit" and is possibly the most talented actress under 20 right now, but her character's development was just so predictable just like the whole transformation that came from her bonding with Knightley's character. She looks up to her, dresses differently and evolves character-wise, but there was nothing fresh about her storyline. It has all been done many many times before. She made the most of it, but I felt she was a bit wasted here.Another scene I really loved was the moment when the two central characters really make a connection, namely when Ruffalo's character tells Knightley's character that it was his wife who cheated on him. The hug from behind is one of the most beautiful shots of the movie year 2013.Other than that, there were quite a few record label references, which I did not find too interesting, but if you are more into the actual physical creation of music, you may disagree. I liked seeing Mos Def again though, eight years after his excellent performance in "16 Blocks".A negative point would be the inclusion of police (rooftop, metro station). I did not really like how they used it to show how the central characters were so alternative and just did what they liked to the level that it was illegal. No need to bring that in. It just seems forced to make them even more likable, but the two already were anyway.Greta's platonic friend was played by James Corden. Random note: He will replace Craig Ferguson as host of "The Late Late Show" in 2015. Solid performance, nothing outstanding. I liked how he was the polar opposite to Adam Levine's character: a street musician, neither rich nor famous, but completely authentic. Another interesting snippet is how both men (one early on, one at the end) ask Greta to come to the stage and sing and she only did it for Corden's character.There is a reference to alcoholism included too, but this is not what the movie is about, so I liked that they did not go further into detail. Had they elaborated on it, it might have left a more serious aftertaste that could have hurt the overall picture.For the most part, everything worked very well and with the exception of some very minor criticisms (Ruffalo's speech against Levine's character at Greta's apartment felt to self-indulgent, Levine risking a longtime relationship with Greta for Mimi not too credible). In the end, this is not really a love story, but much more about forgiveness. However, the most important thing here is the music of course.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The entire movie is disjointed and confusing.Writing ten lines about this gonna be hard. The acting from most of the cast is actually pretty okay,for what seem like a small budget movie.Never knew Keira could sing,but never given it much thought.I think they meant the music to be the focus,but somewhere along the line they changed it to a:stick to the man kind of movie,than they change it back again to a long music video.The main problem is,for me anyway.That you really don't care about the ex boyfriend who's supposed to be the catalyst for everything. That happens to Gretta from them splitting up.I mean the dude couldn't write his own songs,Gretta did all the writing. ***********************spoiler**********Spoilers*********spoiler One thing that annoyed me,was when Dan get fired,for not bringing in the talent,the company needs.Then he discovers gretta and produce her album on his own,and it becomes a hit.Why would he want his old job back?? I mean he was clearly out of sync with the direction the company was going,so why take your job back,when you proved you were better than them.You were right they were wrong.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am a big fan of movies in which the writer and/or director do not make the easy/clichéd choice. I can now add Begin Again to that club.The plot is simple even if little optimistic. Gretta (Keira Knightley) moves to NYC with her long-time boyfriend (and song-writing partner) when the boyfriend is signed to a big label. Of course, the romance does not survive the newly-found fame (ok, that was a clichéd choice but I can live with that). Gretta now has to find her own way, without her partner (romantic and song-writing). Her discovery by a down-and-out music label exec (Mark Ruffalo) (ok, another cliché) allows her to grow and to get her own chance to sign to a record label. But Gretta makes the unexpected choices regarding romance, recording, and her future (hence the membership to the non-cliché club). OK, you can see some of these choices coming but may not actually expect the characters to go through with them. Kudos also for not allowing the close-knit relationship between the two leads to develop into romance. Platonic relationships do exist and the film recognizes that.Good dialog, good use of NYC for making ambient song recordings, and good acting all- around (including a credible job by Adam Levine of Maroon 5 as the jilting boyfriend). A special treat also for fans of the world of struggling musicians.This makes me want to add director John Carney's prior work, Once, to my queue of movies to be seen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Second Chances</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A cute film by writer-director John Carney, "Begin Again" stars Keira Knightley as Gretta, a young singer-songwriter who has recently been dumped by her boyfriend. Echoing Gretta's plight is Dan (Mark Ruffalo), a middle-aged record producer who has recently been fired by his production company. Deciding to put their pasts behind them, Dan and Gretta "begin again"; they work together to produce a new music album.Before it pushes toward a generic climax, "Begin Again" delivers at least one great sequence. Here an intoxicated Dan watches as Gretta performs a song at a bar's open mic. As Gretta sings, Dan imagines the unattended instruments around her coming to life, layers and layers of sounds being added to her naked vocals. This magical moment marks the start of the couple's romance, but it's a romance which Dan never lets advance beyond the recording room. He's primarily infatuated with Gretta's voice, her love of music, and the future album that gestates within her.Music has long housed and shaped our fantasies. Contemporary music itself largely exists to market sex. In "Begin Again", like Carney's own 2007 feature, "Once", music reignites dying passions, and reinvigorates a pair of lost-souls. By the film's climax, Dan has restored his derailed life, Gretta has pushed past heart-ache and the duo have created a hit music album. An attempt to be "raw", "truthful" and "authentic", this album is recorded in "real world locations", amidst the noisy clatter of pedestrians and traffic. The glossy aesthetic of Carney's film, the content of his script, and his heavy use of lip-syncing, betray the premise of the couple's album.8/10 ? See "Once" and "Before Sunrise".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Apart from its awful title, it is a thoroughly enjoyable movie. It talks about a musician and a producer who decide to record an album. Both are going through personal issues, though they are at very different stages in life. It is a movie that pits various elements against each other: authentic VS unauthentic music, relationships worth fighting for VS ones that one needs to walk away from, and it does so brilliantly.The trailer made it look like a romantic comedy, which it is not, but just as well. It is a slice of life movie which blends elements from romance, musical, and drama to make something which feels very real. The excellent script has great lines and does a nice job of including and contrasting British English speech and mannerisms with American ones. The language is real, people swear with their guts but it doesn't go the way of the vulgar R-rated comedies which are multiplying over the pond. Mark Ruffalo stands out as a fantastically nuanced actor, Keira Knightley impresses too. My biggest shock came when I found out the lovely voice that sung her songs was actually HERS!But ultimately, I yelled "YES", because the movie ends with a good resolution for the main characters. It upholds and honours them as people, in a sex-saturated movie industry, where characters jump into bed on first dates at an alarming rate, and even in a relationships- obsessed society, where it is impossible for someone not to be with someone!The French actor-director-scriptwriter Alexandre Astier says comedy and drama are part of life and therefore good movies should have their share of both. I think this one does a good job of it, and with great music at that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Outstanding story of flawed people getting chances to "begin again".</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Keira Knightley is Gretta, a Brit living in New York. Her boyfriend, singer Adam Levine as Dave, is very commercially oriented, while she likes to write songs for her own fulfillment. Mark Ruffalo is Dan, a once successful music producer who has not had success for several years, is mostly estranged from his wife and daughter, and seems about to be fired from his job. He is on the edge of self-destruction.One evening at an open mic spot he is having a beer when Gretta is talked into singing one of her compositions, accompanying herself on guitar. Dan sees something in her, and his imagination adds percussion, violin, and other instruments to her simple tune. He knows he can make a hit record with her but he has two obstacles ... she isn't interested and he can't get the record company to put up any money for producing a commercial quality demo.So, much of the movie involves Gretta and Dan finally getting together to make music, and he hits upon the idea of getting volunteer musicians and using the open spaces and sounds of the city itself for the recordings. Hailee Steinfeld is good as the teenage daughter Violet who turns out to have some ability with the guitar. Catherine Keener is good as the mother Miriam. And Adam Levine, although not an experienced actor, does fine in his role. SPOILERS: In the end everyone gets a chance to "begin again". Gretta decides to distribute her album herself, via online streaming, changing only $1.00, the amount she would have gotten from the record company if she had let them do it. Dan and Miriam seem to have a fresh start, Violet has a fresh relationship with her parents. Dave</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Attention Music-loving New York freaks! A good film you must watch!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Begin Again is what you would call a "good" film. just good and nothing more. The story of a chic British girl with a unique music talent and a messed-up but somehow genius New York music producer filmed with a cool "New York" theme will amaze any one with a keenness towards New York. You probably have seen a lot of "New York"s in this review so far, but this is how New Yorkish the film actually is! Of course if like me your utopia is New York then you would be just fine, but the emphasize on the city theme might actually wear the rest down. The gathering of good and some great songs in the film with just a brush of style and chicness of characters might just be what you need to watch this film; but surprisingly it has more to offer! The insights given on relationships might be one of its strong suits. Take the father daughter relationship portrayed in the picture; It is not following any of the clichés you are seeing in the films these days, It's actually quite more realistic and believable. Begin Again is a story about second chances. without getting into details, (but of course you can get this from the title, duh!) you are going to see a different take on a lot of things where you haven't seen much before and I think you are going to be wooed that way. I am sure no admirer of this picture would want to read these, but the film has some flaws also. The desperate film references made in the beginnings of the film mixed with the "Lost in Translation"-like vibes it's trying to send is actually not working. Add this to the plot holes you're easily going to figure out and it might actually lose some marks! Hats off to Keira Knightley, but I can't think of Mark Ruffalo as the cool hip hop or punk or pop music producer, he is more of a Justin Bieber kind of a guy to me! But all in all, I would say this sentence one more time: Begin Again is a good film and I think a lot of New York freaks or music lovers are going to enjoy a film like this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An amazing, epic and unexpected movie about what music does to people, the way it changes their lives and how it is able to create magical moments from banalities. Those kind of magical moments, you want to sink in and never get out. Moments, when you stare at people around you, look at traffic, watch the sun or just stand in the rain. Music makes all of it magical. It's basically like love. Makes everything around us much brighter and more beautiful. I recommend this movie to every music lover out there. To every listener. To every passenger of this life who hasn't yet found either love or the joy of being part of the music. To every soul that hasn't got the chance to sing yet. Just go with it, watch the movie and it will help you see the world the way it is. Filled with love, joy and people who are willing to sing along.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing film about the struggle to maintain our personality and moral code!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What a brilliant vibe! Would you like to watch an emotionally rich and powerful story discussing sensitive human aspects with spikes of realism on a wallpainting of wonderfully romantic cinematography? Look no further! Very few words can do justice to the feeling you receive from viewing this film. At the end of it all, I felt justified, tears running down my eyes which I tried to conceal. It builds up so fully, colorfully and intensely like a great relationship that you never want to let go. Hate, anger, rage, confusion, sorrow, despair, agony, pity, compassion, hope, enthusiasm, humor, playfulness, groove, admiration, contentment and JOY, all depicted in such vivid and vibrant manner.The movie bursts with the scent of life and the living. It is a "young" movie and a movie about youth. A youth that is most and foremost idealistic. In refusal of sense and reason this mature and yet stubborn youth fails to abandon its true cause. Bringing forth a revolution of disarming honesty, pervasive directness and relentless provocation.Keira Knightley embodies a musician who has recently broken up with her boyfriend, also a musician who has reached the doorstep of commercial success and fame is affecting his character and life choices. She urges him to stay true to himself and manifests her faith in his good nature even as he betrays her somewhere along the line. Keira is struggling inside whilst every now and then radiating with confidence. She juggles to keep it all together, like women do. In the end she finds balance in her inviolable moral code. Her performance is peacefully astounding.Mark Ruffalo is spectacular. He delves so deep into this character I can argue that his performance is palpable. He peculiarly reminds me of Al Pacino in taxidriver (dont ask me why!). Perhaps it is the richness of his portrayal or the motion of Mark plays a lover of music, spent music producer and tormented family man who finds himself in the verge of losing faith to himself and others as he randomly comes across Keira performing in a bar as a favor to her friend. Purportedly he has a gift for discovering talented musicians. The magnificent blend of Mark and Keira that follows you will have to enjoy for yourself. Mark is set on a flaming, forceful and fulfilling orbit around Keira, borderline flirting with Keira who becomes his muse. Most crucially, they express their passion and turmoil in a zealous, heartfelt musical project validating their worth.Most excellent supporting performances from a prominent cast (Mos Def,Catherine Keener, James Corden, Hailee Steinfeld, CeeLo Green) and the remarkable directorship of John Carney endow this feature with a spontaneous and original ambiance. I likewise particularly enjoyed the photography even though on occasions it adopts some clichés.Begin again is beyond any shadow of doubt a film I will be watching again and again... :D</fullReview>

		<fullReview>John Carney's Once was a low budget film with a lovely message, a message that subsequently saw the film become a success the world over, an Oscar winner for Best Original Song and now a tale adapted into a stage musical, so Carney's next high profile venture was always going to be judged somewhat in comparison to his hit but thankfully Begin Again can be easily recommended despite not hitting the high notes of that Once did.It would be hard to defend Begin Again from those that call it a little naff or sugary but it would also be hard for them to say it's a film that has no charm for this tale is one that will bring a smile to your face if you let it and has a message within it that no matter how many times we see it portrayed is still relevant to us as humans. It's interesting that Carney has once more set his tale around music and where Once soared in its tunes Begin Again merely entertains in this stake and it's more than likely due to a less experienced singer in Keira Knightly being at the helm rather than esteemed talents like Glen Hansard and Markéta Irglová but it's not to say the leads in this tale are any less engaging.While Knightly struggles to convince as a singer/songwriter she has some fine moments in her non singing parts, her Gretta a likable presence when she could've quite easily become a grating one. The star of the show here really is Mark Ruffalo however who continues to produce quality turn after quality turn and while he may not get the recognition as some of his counterparts there is little doubt that his one of the most consistent actors in the business today with his miserable yet not undeservedly so record label owner Dan another of his fine creations. While singers Adam Levine, Mos Def and Cee-Lo Green don't add much to the overall tone of the film other supports from Hailee Steinfeld and James Cordon do fine work but other than Ruffalo the best character here is by far New York city itself with Carney capturing the metropolis in one of the finest ways in recent memory, it truly does feel like a living breathing member of the cast.A feel good movie that does exactly what the doctor ordered, Begin Again is something we've all seen before but it's something done with enough flavour of its own that it's by no means ever tedious or intrepid and with some likable characters and a story that thankfully plays out exactly how it should by avoiding many a cliché. Quick, breezy and effective, Begin Again is middle range movie making at its most recommendable.3 outdoor recordings out of 5 For more movie reviews and opinions check out - www.jordanandeddie.wordpress.com</fullReview>

Knightley is less believable than the scruffy Ruffalo, but this is her least self-conscious performance I've seen. The music-making partnership between them could easily devolve into cliché, but I'm glad to say it escapes that trap, as they set up shop in various outdoor Manhattan locations to record the tracks of her possible breakout album. Meanwhile, he defends her potential to his former recording-company partner, enjoyably played by Mos Def. Both lead characters are separated from their significant others?Knightley from her success-obsessed boyfriend, played by real-life music star Adam Levine, and Ruffalo from his wife, played by Catherine Keener in too small a role.

		<shortDescription>Total harmony between music and film, and smart too</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>How is John Carney the only filmmaker who knows how to make a contemporary musical? The "Once" filmmaker recaptures some of that film's magic in "Begin Again," a more mainstream approach for a wider American audience. With a team of terrific songwriters and a top-notch cast, "Begin Again" is a welcome reminder of why and how much we love music. Keira Knightley and Mark Ruffalo star as a singer/songwriter and indie music producer, respectively, who both meet one night after the worst day of their lives. Ruffalo's Dan is an alcoholic separated from his wife who gets fired from the music label he built and Knightley's Gretta was just dumped by her rising music star boyfriend, Dave (Adam Levine). Dan is convinced Gretta's the one who can turn his fortunes around, and the two take a chance on each other and endeavor on a recording project that defies traditional music industry practice.So much of "Begin Again" rides on the music. The primary trio of writers, Gregg Alexander (lead singer of The New Radicals), Danielle Brisebois (writer of Natasha Bedingfield hits "Unwritten" and "Pocketful of Sunshine") and Nick Lashley craft accessible but definitively indie acoustic pop tracks that create both moments of emotional introspection and total feel-good vibes throughout the film. It's the soundtrack that really allows the film to soak in and become so easy to enjoy.That's why Carney's story works a little better than expected. The relationship that evolves between Dan and Gretta is a little strange and awkward, but both characters start at the bottom of the barrel and undergo personal redemption as they continue to collaborate; the music proves to have a transformative effect on their lives. Carney is fascinated with the way music impacts those who make it, and how it can literally change people's feelings and influence their actions. It's this reason that he also understands the role music plays in a film, that a film and a story can become something more in a symbiotic relationship with the music rather than a relationship in which one is clearly second to the other and merely complements it.Ruffalo and Knightley are also the right kind of performers to help achieve the synthesis of story and song. They bring such soul to their roles. Ruffalo's strength has always been hard to pinpoint, but in "Begin Again," authenticity emerges as his strong suit. Dan is deeply troubled, but also hopeful and intensely passionate. Ruffalo helps ground the movie with his performance, bringing something raw and dramatic to a film that could've been a breezy musical romance in the wrong hands. Knightley too is terrifically cast. Gretta is a true artist repulsed by fame, who loves music in just the purest way a person can. If she were too much of a flashy Hollywood actress, her character wouldn't have been as credible.That's a stark contrast to Levine, who in his film debut plays the antithesis to Gretta, a man too swept up in the fame and spectacle of performing that he loses sight of (what Carney believes to be) the truth of music. As a the writer of radio hit pop songs with little substance and a TV personality, Levine's superficial persona (as soulful of a guy as he might truly be) helps create the dichotomy of the music industry as Carney sees it. A Cee Lo Green cameo also has a similar effect, though in his character's case, he helps to fill out Dan's back story. So these music stars do more than simply pad the cast in order to drum up interest in the movie."Begin Again" has a lot to say about music and the industry; Carney does not separate his beliefs from the story. The music is truly the main character and the antagonist is anyone who tries to manipulate it from it's most authentic form: the raw, earnest expression of human emotion. This belief dictates a quite a bit of the story and ultimately what happens in the film. Carney's not the kind of filmmaker who will simply wrap things up in that cheesy escapist romantic comedy way. So those looking for total musical Hollywood bliss might not totally understand "Begin Again," but for the artists, music-lovers and creative types, it's a thoughtful film that's almost impossible not lap up.~Steven CThanks for reading!

		<fullReview>John Carney the director who bought us the beautiful musical "Once" back in 2006 has offered a true piece of romantic movie again that touches the senses. And it's filled with breathtakingly mesmerizing music one after the other and the charmingly graceful performances by Keira Knightley and Mark Rufalo. And when all of those combined with a lovely storyline that sinks right in to fans heart how can a movie like this ever go wrong. And by far this is one of the best musical filled comedy dramas I can recall.When Dan (Mark) a talented yet beaten up by life music agent desperately looking for new talent to get his life a jump start, accidentally meets Gretta (Keira) a beautiful girl with a voice he was looking for. But convincing her to sign up to do an album was challenging enough for Dan as Gretta is about to leave town with a broken heart.No doubt that pinnacle of Begin Again is its music. Five minutes down the movie it throws out a wonderful track that instantly grabs the viewer. And this moment becomes the central point of Dan meeting Gretta where it is visited couple of times via different story lines making its presence stronger. Starting from this song and the opening sequence the movie quickly yet steadily evolves in to something serenely beautiful and so does its music. The two key roles has their own independent story lines running alongside which fuels the main plot and the director has managed to beautifully blend everything together.However Begin Again is bit far from reality though it covers its faults with a dramatic cloak and its charming performances and music. But to enjoy this movie the absolute reality factor is not something that's really required. And honestly compared with often seeing cheesy romantic dramas that pops up like mushrooms these days Begin Again is a modern wonder.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>That music though!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>-Begin Again, which actually came out earlier in the year, is about a music producer who's job and marriage are ruined, when he finds a talented musician, who doesn't want to make music, who's relationship is also ruined. They become friends, make music, and learn how to work hard to fix their relationships and, well, begin again.-So as this type of film goes, I would directly compare it to Chef. It's redemptive themes are great and inspiring! I really enjoyed it! -The story is very good. It was very original, to me at least, and I enjoyed that they didn't end up together like cliché would ordinarily dictate. It also gives an insight as to how the music industry can carry an emotional burden with it.-The acting was very good! Keira Knightley is GREAT!! Mark Ruffalo does a good job, but he has a few moments where he overacts. The girl from True Grit is in it and she does a great job too! (Maybe better than Mark)-It has a pretty realistic and uplifting tone to it, and it is well paced.-There is not a lot else I really have to talk about, so I guess I will mention the best thing about it, which is the music. I loved the music. Keira Knightley is actually a really great singer and the original songs in it are just wonderful! Lost Stars, the film's theme, might just win an Oscar.-Content: It is rated-R for some moderate, but realistic language.-So, Begin Again is a very down-to-earth film with a positive message and great music! I did really like it and I will say it is totally worth checking out! Because of the music, a great ending, and the themes that work soo well with the song, I would actually give it a high 7.5. Even if you don't watch the film, listen to Lost Stars!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love good musical movies, and like the idea of a star being given the chance to be a star storyline. This type of movie has been done countless times, most often they seem to fail and fail miserably. This one has a lot of redeeming features, namely the soundtrack. To say the music is good is an understatement, and if you are trying to decide if this movie deserves your time or money, it does but mostly for the music.It's really obvious that Keira Knightly can't play the guitar, she can carry a tune through, as her singing is decent. In fact all the actors hired to pretend to be musician are just that, actors, not musicians. Mark Ruffalo's daughter in the movie can't even hold a guitar pic right, all of which makes this disturbing, why couldn't the producers/directors at least hire musicians to play musicians? Wouldn't that add some authenticity to their movie? With all that said, if you can look beyond what I previously said, this is an enjoyable movie. It's very predictable, the acting is very weak, the storyline is equally weak, but it is a feel good enjoyable, life is good type light-weight movie that I recommend, mostly because of the exceptional supporting soundtrack.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Found what I was looking for..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is such a breath of fresh air after so long. Ever since watching the legendary Almost Famous, I have been on the lookout for similar movie. Although I would never say this movie will even come close to accomplishing what Almost Famous did, nor is it along the same lines, but for me its a celebration of good music. It echoes some of my thoughts on what has happened to the music industry today and on some level, struck a cord with me, hence the high rating. I think the casting is perfect, I don't think Scarlett Jo would have been able to pull off the heartbroken song writer look because lets face it, who would leave her?! The music is definitely refreshing but what really got me hooked was that first 10-15 minute sequence when the first song is shown from Ruffalo's perspective and he adds some background instruments with his mind and somehow the song becomes 15 times more awesome! Its definitely a feel good movie and will leave you with a pleasant taste in your mouth no matter what kind of movies you like. But I have a feeling this will be only highly appreciated by only certain kinds of people, but i personally hope it becomes a permanent member on the list of movies about good music.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched "Begin Again" expecting a good movie full of music and found myself enjoying a great movie with awesome music.Why is that?Everything fits: the acting is good; I especially liked Keira Knightleys appearance very much the music is mindblowingly beautiful and motivates to grab a guitar yourself the storyline is quite easy, but touching and contains a lesson about how the big music industry works and what it does with the people caught in its treadmill.A movie to be seen by all who enjoy music and want to get a little happy time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Feel good movie of the year</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Very pleasant film starring Keira Knightley as Gretta, a Briton leaving in New York. She has just separated from her rock star boyfriend and writing partner Dave (Adam Levine), and is about to return to London, when she is asked to perform impromptu by his friend Steve (James Corden) in a club. Down and out producer Dan (Mark Ruffalo) happens to be there at the time, and is entranced by her performance and tries to sign her for a record label headed by his ex partner Saul (nicely played by rap artist Mos Def). She is initially reluctant but finally goes along.Though marketed as a romantic comedy, it hardly follows the "boy meets girl" formula. Knightley sings many songs in the movie, not all memorable (I did like "A step you can't take back" which is included in the movie's best scene, as Dan imagines Gretta's acoustic performance accompanied by a full rock orchestra). Knightley usual charm is the major driver of this feel-good movie, though most performances are fine. Also with Catherine Keener and Hailee Stanfield, as Dan's ex wife and daughter. There is a great scene after the final credits you should wait for.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrific non-musical movie about music and love</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought this movie was going to suck, but I am hot for Keira Knightley and I don't mind Mark Ruffalo. I don't enjoy romantic comedies and especially not musicals. Bring in a musical artist as a main actor, I thought this movie was a recipe for failure.Regardless of my predispositions, I always give every movie a fair and unbiased shot. I was pleasantly surprised with this flick, despite it's predictability. This is one of few movies to successfully fuse music, love, self-discovery, passion, self-worth, business, and family. Another big surprise to me in this movie was Keira Knightley, who turns out to have a magnificent Americanesque singing voice, which you can sample on the official soundtrack.Overall, a surprisingly good movie with feel-good vibes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I know a movie is good if I wouldn't mind watching it again after I just finished it for the first time. And when I know I'll watch it again and again in the future. Begin again is that kind of movie.It's a simple story really: two people who are going through a difficult time in their lives meet each other, they connect, in this case through their mutual love for music, and without even trying to, without realizing about it, they help each other overcome their troubles, they help each other to begin again.What makes this movie special is the way that story is presented to the audience: the mixture of charismatic actors, lovable characters, beautiful songs and a impeccable direction.Mark Ruffalo and Keira Knightley are just perfect in these roles. I've always found Knightley to be an enchanting screen presence, you can not stop looking at her when she's on screen. She doesn't have an incredible voice, but it's good enough for this movie and its sweetness makes it perfect for her character. And Ruffalo is completely credible as this alcoholic, depressed father. This is probably my favorite work of him. In other movies I never thought too much about him, he was just there, not bad, but not noteworthy either. Although I have to admit I haven't seen many of his movies. But in this one he carries the film with Knightley effortlessly. Their chemistry is tangible, I even wondered during several points in the movie if their characters where going to end being more than friends. And in a way they are, they are more than two people who share a common passion and the suffering of betrayal, they get to understand each other in ways not even their closest friends and family seem to. Dan gives Gretta a way to express her pain and to share her soul (her lyrics) with the world. In a way she likes, not in the distorted way her ex-boyfriend is doing it. And Gretta makes Dan remember what it is he loves to do and how good he is at it. Making him find a way to be close with his family again.An special mention to Adam Levine. He did fine as Gretta's boyfriend. I wouldn't say his acting was exceptional, but it wasn't bad either. But his voice made up for everything anyway. Especially in the last song he sings. It just got me and even made feel bad for his character even though he clearly didn't deserved.I would like to comment on the first part of the movie too. The way the audience is able to see the same moment through the two main characters' point of view was so well done. And to me it was very effective. It could have been confusing, going back and forward in time, but not only it wasn't, it was a beautiful and original way to set up this story and the characters' background.I guess some people would call Begin again cheesy or unrealistic or whatever... Maybe it is, all I really know for sure is I had a good time watching it, it never felt boring and it left me feeling good, even optimistic. I love movies that manage to do that and unfortunately they aren't many these days.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It has all the ingredients of the perfect ROMCOM but alas it's not a ROMCOM cos the protagonists eventually don't end up together, but it's a great story with excellent casts like Mos Def and Ceelo Green and Adam Levine.Show starts off slow and weak with both sides of characters played by the ever- inspiring Mark Ruffalo and the gorgeous Keira Knightly having to leave their jobs and loved ones and everything is down and dusted. Their meeting was magical, cinematography at the club Keira was playing in was superbly shot and this movie brings joy, laughter and tears. Mark Ruffalo's daughter in the movie was played by Hailee Steinfield, which none of us have ever heard of. She handled the innocence of being torn by estranged mother and father so well and should be noted.Keira's character's BFF in the movie was a Brit James Corden, who's character is too affable i felt and a bit underplayed. And way too much talent for the character he played.But all in all, everything felt well placed and fit and should make for a delightful evening of lighthearted humor and the underdog story. The ending was not expected tho....and not very intentionally put, maybe that's the whole point of it all...must watch for all music lovers and Keira fans out there...gonna find the album on Itunes now.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Begin Again" is the story of how an ex-music producer, who is down on his luck, and a singer/songwriter, who is about to give up on her aspirations, meet and produce an album together. The film begins with Gretta (the singer/songwriter's) performance at a local bar. She is hesitant to play, and doesn't receive much of a crowd reaction. Then, we quickly jump back to earlier that day. Dan, the ex-music producer, wakes up, and we soon learn he is an alcoholic. We see he has an awkward relationship with his daughter, and he gets fired from the music label he founded. Dan obviously has major problems in his life. At the end of the day, after a day of drinking he goes to a bar. Not really paying attention to the music, he becomes mesmerized with Gretta's song. This is the beginning of their relationship. He envisions the same song she sings, but with a full band of accompaniments. After her performance, Dan approaches her, and asks her to sign with his record label. She tells him she'll consider. We then learn that Gretta was in New York City with her boyfriend, Dave. Dave was just about to make it big, and tours the states. Gretta becomes lonely, and learns that Dave had an affair with someone involved with Dave's record label. Gretta leaves Dave, and is about to buy plane tickets back home when her good friend convinces her to come to open mic night at a bar. Then we fast forward to Dan getting a call from Gretta telling him she is interested. The rest of the film is about them recording her new album, and Dan getting his life and family back together. Time is greatly manipulated. The exposition takes place with Gretta performing at the bar. Then we rewind to that morning, and see Dan's day. Then we go back about a few weeks or so and witness Gretta and Dave moving in to the city and growing apart, until he cheats on her. Then the next few weeks are sped up. Time is rewound and condensed in this movie. This film was written and directed by John Carney. Carney also wrote and directed, "Once," another musically involved movie. Mark Ruffalo plays Dan and Keira Knightley portrays Gretta. Maroon 5 singer Adam Levine plays Dave, Gretta's boyfriend. Keira Knightley and Adam Levine actually perform the songs they play in the film. A major theme present in this movie is family, friendship and togetherness. Dan manages to become a part in his daughter's life, and eventually get back together with his wife. The family was able to stick together, despite awkwardness, a falling out, and cheating. Gretta leaves her boyfriend, Dave, after he cheats on her. When she starts working with Dan he becomes a close friend. At certain points during the latter part of the film, it almost appears as though she loved him, and he loved her. As far as we could tell though, Gretta and Dan do not end up together. Another theme in this movie is perseverance. Dan loses his job, but still earns to find the next popular star. Gretta is reluctant to make an album with Dan, but his willingness and determination in her, and her music proved to her that she should persevere and record the album. This movie is pretty believable. On the Scale of Verisimilitude it would be placed slightly to the photo-realism side of the middle. The only scene in that is fantastical, is the when Dan watches Gretta play at open-mic night for the first time. He visualizes other instruments playing with her. This scene is very interesting and entertaining. The genre of this movie is Sentimentalism. It is about a family sticking together after going through tough times. The most important element of drama in this movie is its plot. The story of this movie is original and keeps the audience entertained. The secondary element of drama in the movie is its characters. Dan is a multi-dimensional man, who changes his life around and becomes a happier person. Gretta is an interesting and talented musician who independently writes great music. Dan begins as a slacker, alcoholic, and lazy man, who simply cannot seem to maintain anything of sustenance in his life. His encounters with Gretta, and spending more time with his daughter change him. He becomes helpful, fun and romantic. He also sheds his addiction to alcohol and gets his job back at his record label. The major dramatic question of "Begin Again" is what happens next? We see that the album Dan and Gretta produced has been released. We know that Dan and his wife seem to have gotten back together. We know the Dan got his job back. The album is also making tremendous sales. However, we know very little about what Gretta plans to do. It seems unlikely that she'll end up with Dave, but she might go back home. Dan's ex-marriage and his daughter's relationship with him, and Gretta coping with Dave's absence. This film satisfies the dual purpose of art. It both entertains and instructs. It arouses emotions like happiness and joy when the music is playing. It also asks questions, and provokes thought. We question the different character's motivations for doing things from time to time. This movie is fabulous. Its characters have clever and witty dialogue. They seem like real people. They use profanity and speak their minds. Dan treats his daughter like an adult and speaks to her like such. He progressively becomes a better parent and uses better language towards her, and the rest of the characters in the film. Dan's idea to record the album in the streets of New York is ingenious. Keira Knightley is an amazing singer, and an extremely convincing Gretta. This entire movie is entertaining and exciting. This film offers an incredible look into the music industry. This is one of the best movies so far of 2014.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not quite sure how to write 10 lines about a film without containing any (spoiler) information about it. I thought this was a very good film. But there is a good reason for giving it an 'R' rating. I find it really hard to believe that relatively normal people, such as depicted in the film, would speak with continual cursing using the worst of words, as though it was the way they always speak in normal conversation. I definitely would not want to be around anyone who talked like the characters in this film do, just so much fun and games with every other words the dirtiest curse words possible. Other than that, I thought it was a very good story which kept me totally engrossed. I liked all the actors and characters and the music, and would definitely 'like' to recommend it, but would never in a million years recommend it to anyone at my church, or anyone with what I consider to be normal morals.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A truly worthy love letter to New York, Romance, Music, and Second Chances.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film, to look from a distance, seems like your usual dime a dozen ROM-COM. All the tropes seem to be in place, just waiting to be ordinary, forgettable experience. Just like all the pop songs that use the same chord progression as "Pachelbel's Canon in D". Though, just like some of those songs, a little personality will turn it from generic, to the song you hum in the shower.The film introduces you to its leads in a very interesting way. Which hooked me right away. You are then given context to the night of their serendipitous meeting. Seeing the events that placed both of them in the same venue at just the right moment as to have, what could be, a life changing moment for them both.It is filled to the brim with music. Most of which is very enjoyable, if not a little more Pop than my personal taste. Which is fine, there isn't a sour note in the whole film.All of the actors are used to great effect. Which is impressive with the number of real greats it contains. Keira Knightly is instantly likable here. Her character always seems to have the right intentions if not the best execution. Mark Ruffalo, like always, shines as the washed up music producer/record label executive. Waiting to regain his life after a series of failures. Adam Levine, well, seems to play a different version of himself, only much less likable at times. Kathrine Keener, isn't in the movie enough. I think most people will agree. I like her a lot and she is always fun to watch. She does what she does better than anyone else, in my humble opinion. Each story is granted the time it deserves, without staying overly long with any single person. You really get to understand and relate to all the character motivations in the time given. Even when there are deviations from the usual or expected, with some of the relationships. You know exactly why those things happen and understand the reasons, behind those decisions.All in all, I really enjoyed this film. I have seen many a film that fails at what this story attempts. Yet it really does nail it. It is about dealing with the unexpected derailment that life seems to drop on you. Giving examples of how to pick up the pieces and get back on track. It's a good thing then, that the first song we hear is about finding yourself in the subway without direction.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Leaves you smiling</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When considering the elements that make up Begin Again, it's apparent that this could have been a disaster. A heartwarming tale featuring Keira Knightley as an under-appreciated singer-songwriter, plucked from obscurity by a washed-up music executive who hears something special when he accidentally catches her only live performance in a New York bar? Keira Knightley singing? James Corden as Keira Knightley's acoustic-guitar-strumming best buddy? The guy from Maroon 5?Well it is quite heartwarming actually, and it largely works. Much of this can be put down to Mark Ruffalo's relentless likability even when playing flawed characters. Reminiscent of his recent performance in 'Thanks for Sharing', his character's renewed enthusiasm for music is genuinely infectious and therefore believably so in the context of the film. Knightley's singing is fine, though it hardly stops you in your tracks, while the songs are generally good enough to feasibly convince as minor, middle-of-the-road hits. There are various subtexts regarding the music industry and its relationship with artists, among other things, but these always feel secondary to the life-affirming central story of a pair of people helping each other to pursue what makes them happy.Begin Again leaves you smiling, and that's the measure of success for this type of film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(88%) A real nice surprise, as I was originally in two minds to even go and watch this, but I'm very glad that I did as this is very likely to be the most uplifting film of the year, and if not, then it's certainly at the very least one of them. It's such a sweet-natured, charming watch that's structured as well as the songs performed. And if ever a movie that's worth a cinema ticket price for the sound quality alone, then it's this one, as the crappy speakers on a modern flat screen TV aren't gonna cut it. Mark Ruffalo is hands down perfect in this, he couldn't be any better, and Keira Knightly really does a fantastic job in expanding her range, and not only through her fine acting performance, but in actually being a pretty decent singer/performer too. I loved the location work with so much of it shot on real New York streets, as the surroundings worked their way into the film perfectly. As far as modern-day romantic comedy dramas go that push through pure genuine happiness without the need to use cheap Hollywood gimmicks, or any over-use of syrup; that's both funny and realistically dramatic, this really is a wonderful, music-filled and joyful treat of a film that's a perfect tonic when you're feeling down. A pick of the year for me without a doubt.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not exactly boy meets girl, but sort of like that</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Begin Again (2013/II) was written and directed by John Carney, It's a movie with a fairly basic plot--struggling, formerly great music producer (Dan, played by Mark Ruffalo), meets young, inexperienced singer-songwriter (Gretta, played by Keira Knightley) and the magic begins.What makes this more than just another summer movie is the great acting--from the two leads, and also from Hailee Steinfeld as Violet, Dan's daughter, and Catherine Keener as Miriam, Dan's estranged wife. Also, I've never understood what a record's producer brought to the team. Here, it was clear to me that Dan could listen to a young singer playing her guitar, and hear in his head what she would sound like with full musical accompaniment. That's a talent that he had, and others didn't.Another highlight for me was the concept of avoiding the cost of a studio by recording an album outdoors in various locations across New York City. It's one of those ideas where you say, "It's so crazy, it just might work."We saw this film on the large screen at the Little Theatre in Rochester, NY. It probably will work better on a large screen than on DVD. However, it's worth seeing, so if it's not playing locally, watch it any way you can. It's not a magical movie, but it's much better than most movies, and you'll be glad that you saw it.</fullReview>

Supporting cast carried their weight really well. Thank you British guy for the lighter moments.Every movie seems to have a lesson or two.

		<shortDescription>Songs of Summer (Raging Film Review)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hidden amongst robots, apes, and kids with cancer is a little gem of a film called Begin Again. From the director of Once, John Carney, comes yet another film filled with music, love, and originality. At times Begin Again plays off as an underdog story of two down-on- their-luck people trying to make it big, but it also is a (literal) love song to the city of New York, as well as a tale of finding happiness in what you love to do. The film opens with Greta (Keira Knightley) performing reluctantly on stage to a bar with people who don't find her very good, save for one man, Dan (Mark Ruffalo), who persists on trying to sign her to a deal. We jump back in time to the events that led him to that bar. We find out he is an alcoholic who is separated from his wife (Catherine Keener), all while he is trying to maintain an almost severed relationship with his daughter, Violet (Hailee Steinfeld.) Dan's glory days are over; he has not found a hit in years, and now, almost at the end of the line, he finds Greta. We switch perspectives and go back in time to see what led Greta to the bar. Her story is as down-putting as Dan's; she came to New York with her singer boyfriend Dave (Adam Levine), only to have his success lead him into having affairs. Betrayed, alone, and feeling hopeless, she ends up staying with her friend who drags her along to the fortuitous meeting with Dan. Once they have met, they both see they need each other in this time of need, and so they begin to work together on an album.Ruffalo and Knightley are grand together. Ruffalo is very convincing as an alcoholic father who desperately misses his wife and wishes he can put the pieces back together. At times he seems like Tom Cruise in Jerry Maguire (which is referenced in the film); ambitious and dedicated in trying to make his only shot a hit, but he is also flawed. He drinks, he does not appear to care for his daughter, and he has been hurt in more ways than we know at first. Ruffalo is definitely one of the most consistent actors in Hollywood these days. Knightley, however, truly shines and steals the spotlight. Her voice is so shockingly good that it's hard to believe it is her singing at first, but it really is. This is certainly her best role in years, possibly the best since Atonement.Supporting the two stars are a variety of musicians and actors. Keener and Steinfeld, the wife and daughter of Dan, are great but they are seen too little. It would have been nice to feature them a little more to increase our idea of what Dan is fighting for. Steinfeld, who just 4 years ago was a stern and rigid little girl in True Grit, is now a beautiful and graceful actress whose career is continuously going up. Adam Levine (from Maroon 5), though briefly seen as the love of Greta, proves that he has some decent acting chops even though it is his first feature film. Mos Def plays Ruffalo's partner, and he does an adequate job with what he is given, though it does not standout as much as the other supporting roles. Rounding up the bunch is CeeLo Green, who is probably just playing himself, is entertaining but does not add all too much to the film in general.What I found most charming about this film is its script. It is written in such a way that it isn't linear. The time-shifts help us understand the motives and circumstances of the characters involved, while also adding a new edge to the tried-and-true story. But most importantly is the reason why Ruffalo got fired; he became too tired of the derivative and unoriginal pop music that fills the airwaves. He wanted a new sound, a new voice. He wanted originality, and that is what he saw in Greta. It is clear that for such a musical director, Carney has some grim viewpoints on the current state of the music industry. This film is almost a call for more original music. The film, like I stated earlier, is also a love letter to New York which has been done many times before (mainly by Woody Allen), but thanks to its beautiful soundtrack and the surprisingly talented Knightley, it allows it to not be another copycat, but instead shows New York in a new and different way.In the end, Begin Again is a delightful little indie summer film that avoids explosions, robots, and big budgets in exchange for a talented cast, a somewhat original premise, and a great soundtrack that will have you tapping your feet by the end of the film. So, if you are tired of all the explosive sounds of the big-budget hits, go freshen your ears up with this wonderful little music-driven film.for more reviews, check out ragingfilm.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Twice" a charm</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's bin a while since I've seen a full-blown Indie musical. This one qualifies, even though it's no more than a re-tread of Carney's far-superior 'Once'. I've been meaning for the team behind 'Once' to do something together, and create that magic once again (pun definitely intended), but I did not mean for Carney to take that this literally and self-cannibalize his own work.To be kind to all those involved in the making though, I'll have to say that this one's a spiritual sibling to that masterpiece, with some great music, which still pales in comparison to the original.Lonely once/never-successful leads? Check. One of the characters selling out/involved with someone selling out? Check. Good music, a combo of something eclectic and Indie, as well as a couple of commercial numbers? Check. Hand-held cams? Check. A bunch of small-timers rallying around our leads when needed? Check. An unconventional way to make an album? Check. And many more comparisons to 'Once'? Check, check check....Not mentioning certain spoilers about the lead pair's chemistry and eventual denouement.In spite of all that, I'm sure many haven't seen 'Once', and for them, this work will be a revelation - it'll be like a breath of fresh air.For me, the take-aways were Mark Ruffalo's ever-dependable acting chops, and some of the candor that went into the writing. Knightley's alright, Keener and Steinfeld are wasted (not literally, the alcoholic part of it is left to Ruffalo's character). What was surprising to me is the turn made by Adam Levine (Maroon 5) in a role that's almost like a callback to his real-life character, exposing the non-Indie music industry's shallowness with a viciousness that must've struck close to home for someone like him, and it was refreshing to see him tackle it with gusto, and like I said, it's really weird too.Definitely worth a watch, on the big screen, esp. when I did not expect it to be releasing locally at all (it's playing in the smallest multiplex screen for 1 show/night for 1 week, so there). Go watch it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pulses with Uplifting Life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Carney's Once was a pleasant little surprise that bordered on being revelatory, with sweetness and beautiful music oozing out its ears. Begin Again doesn't fall far from that tree. It's a love letter to the power of music, during the mundane and the striking alike. Are its songs as immediately beautiful as Once? No, but at times that's the point: the instant gratification of pop music versus the idealism of art. Throughout its many highs and fleeting lows, Begin Again pulses with uplifting life. The framing is wonderfully inventive, starting on the night that Ruffalo and Knightley's characters meet and then jumping back to tell us how each of them got there. It's like a movie and its prequels rolled into one. Despite a couple of hurky-jerky scene cuts, the editing and pacing is pretty great: heartfelt and truly unique, with some super fun performances. Corden has a breakout role as the comedic relief BFF, Steinfeld authentically captures precocious teen-dom, and Ruffalo is always a pleasure. His character in particular is a case study for how to show and not tell, specifically in an early and hilarious scene of him listening to demo tapes. Begin Again wears its heart on its sleeve throughout (the subtle cinematography, the effective musical themes, NYC as a character), but sometimes when you wear your heart on your sleeve it can be overbearing. All the sincere goodness in the film is slightly marred by cheesiness, yet not overwhelmingly so. It overcomes these faults with slight and firmly planted romance. Begin Again will raise your spirits without pandering to your expectations.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just enough to keep you interested with an ending that fits</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is full of clichés and feels like it was written by someone who hates the music industry of today and wrote this script to critique it.If you're a fan of Keira Knightley there is just enough cuteness in this movie to make it worth while to you. It is no "Love Actually" or "Bend it like Beckham", but it will do.I did not like Mark Ruffalo in this role. He seemed out of his comfort zone. I can't say I liked or dislike Adam Levine's performance. He was kind of irrelevant. But he definitely can sing.It had just enough good scenes to keep you entertained with a conclusion that I liked and I would recommend it to couples looking for a romantic movie with nothing better to watch. Teenagers looking for a little inspiration or guidance and aspiring artists.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sing a Song of Love</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is recommended. Its title is doesn't say much, almost seeming like a sweet afterthought but a necessary means of identification without any real meaning. That too sums up the movie, Begin Again. This low- budget independent film charts the meeting of two mismatched lovers who never appear to be soul-mates. It's as if their only connection is the song, which also is the only driving force in this semi-love story.Dan (Mark Ruffalo) is a washed-up music producer whose life has seen better times. He is estranged from his wife and teenage daughter. Gretta (Keira Knightley) is a soulful songwriter, newly heart-broken by her recent break-up with her successful musician boyfriend. Dan and Gretta meet and join forces to record a live musical album. They begin to bond and sort out their personal demons.Begin Again tries to avoid predictability at all cost, but its non-predictability becomes its main calling card. The film has a nice soundtrack, filled with lovely original music. (Especially memorable is its theme song, Lost Stars.) Were that its screenplay had the same insight and passion. The script by the director, Jim Carney (Once), lightly touches on some character development but rarely delves deeply with their self-destructive behavior or dramatic situations: Dan drinks heavily and behaves erratically, but has that special gift of spotting new talent. Gretta lacks confidence and doubts herself as a performer, never wanting to "sell-out". As written, both characters remain sketchy and come to terms with their issues matter-of-factly. Begin Again relies heavily on the actors to supply the missing ingredients. Fortunately, Carney has cast his film with top talent. There is an underlying chemistry with Knightly and Ruffalo. The actors bring the needed believability to their roles. It is in the film's quieter moments that their relationship shines, words not said, the actors' pauses and subtle stares, their boding during the film's improvisational musical scenes. This is where the film connects with the audience. (Ms. Knightley does some fine vocalizing too.) Strong support is also given by James Corden, Hailee Steinfeld, Cathleen Keener, and Adam Levine.Can a Song Save Your Life? was the original title of the film. Perhaps a more apt name could have been Can a Song Save Your Movie? The answer is yes, especially with its two charismatic leads serenading moviegoers. Begin Again is worth a listen.

		<shortDescription>Melancholy With Music</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is Mark Ruffalo's movie. He is always good but in this film he's great. Keira Knightley is very good in her role, but it plain and simple is Ruffalo's picture. There's some good music in this one, both old and new. Knightley has an adequate voice but not a strong, pure sound by any means. Sufficient for this film and the songs she sings. But make no mistake, she won't become a super star recording artist, let's put it that way. Watching and listening to the creation of music, and viewing the possibilities come to life in Mark Ruffalo's character's mind is fascinating. Adam Levine's voice it entirely too high pitched for my taste but for fans, I suspect he's fine for them. All in all, it's a pretty good, musical movie. And refreshing to see something that's not just another trashy, vulgar movie, the type of which we seem to have way, way too many lately.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Begin Again" is one of those heart feel type movies that after you watch you will feel refreshed and uplifted. True it's a drama that blends emotion and starting over in life when your down in the dumps, but hey a lot of people have had to do that at some point or the other. Set in New York city it follows the life of Dan(Mark Ruffalo) who's an alcoholic and a washed up past his prime music executive. And Dan has plenty of problems he's divorced from his wife Miriam(Catherine Keener)and even though he has a daughter he sees this little miss Violet(the up and coming Hailee Steinfeld)is a head strong and easy sexy colored bra wearing young lady who likes to march to her own beat. Anyway by a chance encounter Dan meets Gretta(Keira Knightley)who's a young singer who's going thru a struggle after her now famous boyfriend has left her to sing on the big stage. Soon it's evident that Dan sees talent in Gretta and one by one beautiful music is made together the tunes are different and maybe low key yet it strikes a winning note thru emotion and love. Overall this film isn't about a musical score it's about starting over in life with the right tune thru different notes a different voice and different playing instruments.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Begin Again" is "Once" again but better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I loved this movie. From beginning to end, a smile rarely left my face. OK, so it's essentially a remake of "Once" (2007) with the same writer and director (Irishman John Carney) and the same story (a man and a younger woman from another country meeting in a major city of the guy's nation and uniting to create unconventional music). I actually enjoyed "Begin Again" more than "Once". The earlier film was shot on an almost non-existent budget with camcorders, whereas this one has a decent budget and much more professional production values; I think New York is snazzier than Dublin (I've been to both about half a dozen times); and Mark Ruffalo as the guy and Keira Knightley as the girl are much better actors than ... (exactly - who remembers them?).The movie has a smart opening with beautiful Knightley as the British singer- songwriter Gretta giving an open-mic performance of one of her songs before meeting charming Ruffalo as a washed-up American A &amp; R man Dan before the film backtracks twice to show us how each of these very different characters came to be at this place at this time. In a similar fashion to my wife (who can view a room and mentally refurnish and even redesign it), Dan can visualise how Geta's song would come over with full backing musicians and a revised arrangement.The songs - written by Gregg Alexander of New Radicals - are good, but it is Knightley who is the surprise. Although she is married to a rock and roll player, she is outside of her comfort song here, but she learned to play the guitar for the role and sings well (as indeed she did in "The Edge Of Love").</fullReview>

Every single song in the movie is like a "food" for ears, for sure will be listening to them every day. This is the type of film with soul that you won't find nowadays. I heard about it when it got out but I thought it wasn't that good and didn't want to watch but the day before I heard the soundtrack and I was amazed, especially "Lost Stars".

		<fullReview>Size and Scale: Fits All! 'Must Watch' in a theater while you pay for friends and family! Home collection too! 10 on 10!CineScope: One of the best Hollywood musicals of recent times. Very successful / talented Dan's (Mark Ruffalo) career is nose-diving along side a troubled marriage, making him alcoholic. Gretta (Kiera Knightly) who has devoted her teen / young life for her boyfriend's career but who has cheated on her. It's about Dan and Gretta's struggle and then beginning again successfully in their respective lives with unparalleled passion and conviction. BFB (Bang For the Buck): Must watch for the songs, for songs Kiera sung and enacted on screen, for Mark Ruffalo's drunkard but a very passionate song producer. For the wonderful chemistry between both of them and for lots of beautiful tracks that will last in your memories forever.My High! Incidentally both are songs: 1. Song 'A Step You Can't Take Back': Cut 1: At a bar Gretta was pushed by her friend to sing this even though she is not prepared, and she sings beautifully w/o any supporting instruments. Cut 2 ? Dan in the audience at the same bar, the very moment, heavily drunk, having a great ear for the music, immediately picks up this song, and starts composing it adding and orchestrating various instruments IN HIS MIND. Directorial marvel! And he thus sees a Superstar in Gretta 2. Song 'Like a Fool': Comes at an emotional turning point in Gretta's life. Just the light bass guitar, subtle keyboard and Kiera Knightley's soft but very sad voice and equally deep portrayal of emotions. Unforgettable!

		<shortDescription>Wow! Love this movie. Total surprise.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off given the subject I expected the usual type of plot, find talented shy nobody and make them a star. So cliché and overdone, but I knew it was better than that from the festival reviews I read when it made the circuit. This movie has a very natural feeling to it. They did not overdo anything. That alone makes it amazing to me. They did not pull any cliché punches. Other than maybe Adam Levine's character is a jerk after he get's famous, but they even pulled that back in a way that felt realistic to me. Love Adam Levine's version of Lost Stars. I found out it was written by Greg Alexander, formerly from the New Radicals and Danielle Brisebois! Remember her, former child star? Well I have loved songs from both of them over the years, so I was happy when I found out they wrote this song. The acting was very good. Even the smallest parts seemed to be so well cast, like a group of kids who get pulled in to sing on the street. I am not a big fan of Keira Knightley but she did a very good job here and also she has a pretty good voice. It was effective. I pretty much love Mark Ruffalo in anything. James Corden did a great job as the friend. One thing that came through the screen was they all actually seemed to be having fun. That was nice. This movie was also so refreshing, no sex, no offensive stuff and about 4 swear words total. How rare is that? One of the best movies I have seen this year. Really a true feel good movie without clichés and stupid plot lines. Great job everyone. I hope you win best song at the Oscars so more people will go and see the movie. The little movie that could. Sort of like the plot!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nice songs in an artsy movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie tells of Dan, a once-was-someone music producer, and Gretta, a rising star musician's ex-girlfriend and partner; who meet at a local live music pub when Dan hears Gretta performs. Drunk, distasteful of the current popular music, and losing his job after a dispute at his label, Dan hasn't been a good example for his daughter Violet. After following her ex Dave to New York, Gretta is disappointed because he cheats on her. After their acquaintance at the pub, Dan asks the reluctant Gretta to do a recording. Yielding, Gretta follows Dan to do a low budget, indie recording of her songs in open air locations. She befriends Violet and gets closer to Dan. After seeing Dave won an award, Gretta sends him a song, which prompts him to contact her again. The recording done, Dan and Gretta pitches it to Dan's old label, which likes it very much. Dan gets his old job back but Gretta refuses the deal with the label. Gretta comes to a concert Dave invited her to, but she's once again disappointed when Dave sings her song to the crowd. She then goes to Dan and they release her album via the internet.The movie's story down plays two people's low points of their lives, yet it also cover their joint creative revival process. Begin Again (2013) is one of those movies that doesn't really focus on the story that much. Rather, it aims the focus to feel artsy without being kind of weird. It doesn't present a complicated story even though it introduces enough number of characters and relationships between them that enables such a complex story.The music is easy listening, with songs performed without lip sync. The songs' lyrics also feels not very heavy despite the themes and the use of some explicit words in them. The music feels nice because despite being light, it contains enough instrument sounds varied enough to feel like a band.The movie feels artsy by using the little bit darkened coloration all around and shooting the recording scenes on common yet unusual locations. It also very nice to have a real musician take an acting part here. Even more, it's nice to see an actress take on the songs herself, instead of using lip syncs like most musicals do.I also like how the movie stills plays when the end credits roll in even showing the ending part with it. It makes the movie feels like a news TV show. The costumes and make up are also nice to see, simple enough yet quite helpful in depicting the characters' personality.The acting department feels adequate enough. Kiera Knightley did well enough in portraying the betrayed ex-girlfriend with high potential talent. Mark Ruffalo did great in getting into his character. He gets the right body language improvised on the recording scenes. Having Adam Levine is nice for his voice on the songs, despite his acting is not that good. Hailee Steinfeld gives this movie a nicer touch; too bad that her character's conflict is really resolved. Having experienced names as Catherine Keener and Yasiin Bey, or a.k.a Mos Def, is also nice touches.My opinion is that Begin Again (2013) deserves a 7 out of 10 score. It's quite an entertainment from a movie perspective. But it offers more on the music side.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just go with the flow and let life inspires you to create</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Begin Again is refreshing, sincere and realistic. I think in certain ways it is even better than Once. Original, authentic and spontaneous. It just flows so naturally and captivating that you are just sucked in and want to experience life with the cast. Mark Ruffalo is great. He is very good at portraying an overworked underdog. Here he plays the role of Dan, an award-winning record producer going downhill in his career because of his personal problems triggered by his divorce. His ex-wife Miriam (Catherine Keener) is also in the music business. As for Keira Knightley, it is probably her best ? natural and not too pretentious as her previous work. Still, she could have toned down a little more in some scenes. In this movie she is Gretta, an amateur sing-song writer comes to New York from England with her boyfriend who signs with a big record company. But as fame and the music industry consume him, she painfully realizes their fundamental differences. The best part of the film is the theme/story: how people create music to express emotions and share, not necessarily for fame or money, which easily get in the way of pure artistic creation. On another dimension, it also traces the production and distribution channel of the music business which has evolved into mass participation and authenticity (backup singing or street kids, guitar from the daughter and ambiance) with the popularization of digital technology and the internet. Then we, as audience, also have the same access to creation and sharing. It is also a big slash to marketing and packaging which tend to focus on the looks and images and ignoring the core of the music ? the emotions it represents. Of course the third layer is how music bring seemingly love/marriages/relationship together and/or tear them apart. The movie opens with two heart-broken, frustrated and lonely people's encounter through original music. Greta's first song touches on being alone in a city which exactly show how both of them feel at the time. The way she presents herself reflects the rawness but authenticity of her work. So is her advice to Violet (Hailee Steinfeld), Dan's teenage daughter on how to dress to express herself as a real and confident person. The use of imagination and free flow of ideas flows fluently throughout, I especially like the first scene of the imaginary band and production to go with Greta's song.The movie is inspiring in the sense that everyone one of us can be an artist and create, as long as we do it from the heart. And do not worry about making money, because it will come along the way as long as we do a good job. Lots of sincerity and definitely a wakeup call to push us to focus on what is really important in creation and expression, as well as in chasing our dreams and in interacting with our loved ones. Rich and real in music, emotion, relationship, creativity, confidence and go with the flow. Just sit back and enjoy it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Knight's singing redeemed by acting; Ruffalo charms his way all through the movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When Kevin Spacey appeared as Bobby Darin in "Beyond the sea" (2004), the consensus was that he would pass for the original when he sang. Likewise, Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon were equally impressive as Johnny Cash and June Carter, respectively, in "Walk the line" (2005). But we also had Jamie Foxx who wisely chose Ray Charles's original sound track. So how did Keira Knightly sing, as just a fictional character? She has not reached the bar set by the above-mentioned three. Still, she has a serviceable singing voice which is helped considerably by her clear diction. Putting the singing aside, it is good to see her break new grounds in acting.Knightley plays Gretta who shares both a musical and a romantic partnership with Dave (real-life professional singer Adam Levine whose talent is utilized wisely with restraint as his is but a side character) in England. All goes well until he gets his break and goes to New York for some big time music adventure, with her tagging along. The rest is quite predictable as far as this half of the plot goes.The other half centers around Dan (Mark Ruffalo, oozing such charm as only he can), one time record company executive now hitting a distressingly low point, both with career and family life. This unlikely odd couple hit it off and the mutual attraction is musically triggered more than anything else. Next thing you know they assemble an odd-ball team of musicians to launch a crazy project of recording an album outdoors all over the Big Apple, sort of a marriage of delightful music to the exciting vibe of the city. It works! There is your basic plot and as I faintly alluded to, not everything is predictable. The two leads carry the movie very capably but the marvelous support cast certainly didn't hurt.Lovable James Cordon (I'm going to see him tomorrow in "One chance") is the buddy who takes Gretta in when she walks out of Dave in disgust, and helps her along with the project. Catherine Keener plays the estranged wife to Dan. She seems to like that role but quite unlike in "A late quartet" (2012) when the wife is the victim, it is the husband here. Really wonderful is Hailee Steinfeld (remember her Oscar nomination in "True grit" (2012)?) who nails the role of the neglected, hardened yet longing teenage daughter. Mos Def shuns his rapid-fire mouthing and plays Dan's co-founder of the record company, not really a bad guy but having the hard job of telling Dan that his he falling behind and losing touch with the current reality. In addition to Adam Levine, also from the real-life music scene is Ceelo Green who plays someone who owes his success to Dan and now rises to the occasion when asked to help.Mostly (but not always)predictable and with some sweet moments, this movie is immensely enjoyable although musically, it hasn't quite reached the height of "Once".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pleasant Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>John Carney's Begin Again is a nice little somewhat "feel good" musical set in New York. The film features some very good performances and the songs are also memorable and well written.Begin Again tells the story of Greta (played by Keira Knightley) and her boyfriend/college sweetheart, named Dave (played by Adam Levine of Maroon 5 and The Voice making his feature film debut), who are songwriter partners. Their relationship hits a rocky road when Dave lands a major deal in Los Angeles and strays away from Greta, leaving her on her own. She is discovered on an east village stage by a washed up divorced record label executive named Dan (played by Mark Ruffalo), who takes to her talent and tries to make her a name. As the two begin their collaboration, they run into some problems along the way.There are some clear character arcs in the story as well. Dan, for example, goes from being an unlikeable drunk who is a disgraced and fired record producer, to having his job back, as well as improving his relationship with his daughter. Similarly, Greta goes from being a love-struck songwriter with no real ambitions to being an ambitious songwriter/singer who can clearly think on her own. The stories of these two characters parallel each other well. Other character arcs include Dan's daughter, Violet (played by Hailee Steinfeld), who seems to have limited screen time (disappearing after the first ten minutes and not reappearing until an hour in), going from an angst-ridden daughter to discovering her talents for playing guitar. While Dave, Greta's lover, goes from being an ambitious songwriter/singer to understanding just what fame is doing to him, in a story-arc that is almost like the opposite of Greta's.The acting in the film is very good. Mark Ruffalo has gained some weight, and is showing his age. When he talks to Knightley near the end of the film and says "you know nothing", he delivers that line with such energy and force, it is terrific. Keira Knightly herself comes off as rather bitchy at the beginning of the film, but by the end, she develops into a finer character, even if her performance at times can feel emotionless. Hailee Steinfeld, as Ruffalo's daughter, is wasted and brings nothing to the table. Similarly, Catherine Keener is wasted as Ruffalo's ex, and her character is treated like your typical divorced nagging ex-wife. In his major film debut, singer Adam Levine has a nice voice, but his performances are, at times, bland, though his scenes with Knightley do show good moments of acting. Additionally, of note in the cast are Mos Def (under the alias Yasiin Bey!!!) as the owner of the record studio and Ceelo Green as a character named Troublegum, as a performer (basically playing himself).The songs are really nicely done. One of my favorite scenes in the film is when Knightley and Ruffalo are walking down the streets of New York and they manage to incorporate "Luck Be a Lady" by Frank Sinatra in a way that gave me a feeling of happiness and excitement. The majority of the original songs are written by Gregg Alexander and Nick Lashley (director John Carney himself contributed to two songs, including "Like a Fool" which has to do with trusting people. Knightley herself has a nice singing voice (having been trained by a voice specialist), and songs like "Lost Stars" and "A Higher Place" are good and having meaning. There are many good performances, even if some of the characters exist solely for the purpose of having real nice songs played. Given Carney's previous film, Once, one should probably not be surprised, as that film also dealt with music.Begin Again has a very pleasing tone to it. The songs, along with the character arcs, contribute to the films overall style. Definitely worth checking out.</fullReview>

Brilliant! "Dave Kohl" played by Levine was "Gretta's" boyfriend until taking his musical talent on the road to Los Angeles, California where he ends-up cheating on her and then exposing this to her through his new song when he returns to New York City.

		<shortDescription>A charming and well acted musical comedy drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Begin Again is John Carney's second film following his acclaimed movie Once. I haven't seen Once as of this writing, but I know that he has a specialty concerning movies surrounded around music and singers. Begin Again is one such movie concerning singers and the music world and while it does have a plot that seems very familiar, it does so with an enormous amount of charm that the flaws don't look so apparent.Good: The two leads (Keira Knightley and Mark Ruffalo) are fantastic together. Keira is the cute and lovable inspiring singer and Ruffalo is the alcoholic down on his luck music producer. Obviously, just reading those descriptions will let you now how this will play out, but they have such chemistry together that the familiarity doesn't hurt the film. Their pursuit to make this album is funny and involving. The music written by Gregg Alexander from the New Radicals was very good and catchy. Even Adam Levine does good in his role also. The movie follows an easy plot line, but it ends up going in a very realistic direction making it a very earnest film.Bad: Like I said, the plot isn't anything necessarily new or groundbreaking and it does feature some clichés in these kinds of musical dramas. It maybe can get a little schmaltzy at points.Overall, despite it being very familiar, it has enough good music, great acting, and charm to make you fall in love with it and perhaps inspire you to write some music of your own.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderful! Nearly as good as Once!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>John Carney's follow-up to the enormously popular Once is really pretty similar to Once. This might have annoyed me if it hadn't been a few years since Once, but I didn't mind that much at all. The music isn't quite as good, and he's mostly working with Hollywood stars this time instead of musicians, but I ended up thoroughly charmed by it. Keira Knightley, playing the up-and-coming singer/songwriter trying to get over her recent heartbreak, is just luminous. She is just so damed lovable and sweet. She has a pretty good singing voice, too. Not something you haven't heard before, but it's nice. Mark Ruffalo plays the down-and-out record producer who discovers her. As cliché as the two parts may be, the actors add a lot of personality to them and they come off as real. The film also co-stars Hailee Steinfeld and Catherine Keener as Ruffalo's daughter and ex-wife. Musicians Mos Def, Adam Levine and CeeLo Green also co-star (Levine is the only one who is a decent actor; he plays Knightley's ex-boyfriend, who's becoming a mega-rock star). As I said, the songs aren't quite as good as the ones in Once. They are a lot poppier. But I wouldn't say they're any less heartfelt. The film may not have a "Falling Slowly" level song, but the one Knightley sings as a voice message to Levine is almost as good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It feels good, sounds passable, looks great, and is a really worn out plot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Begin Again (2013)A charming tale of love a music in New York.Yes, I suppose that's a lead that could be reused for a lot of movies. And that's the biggest drawback here?it's another feelgood movie with people overcoming the odds and making it. Is it well done? Sometimes, yes. Mark Ruffalo as a down-on-his luck music producer is strong, giving that cliché some honest believability. (He drinks, but he's not suicidal, he has been kicked out by his wife, but he's still pretty normal with her and their daughter.) So really Ruffalo and his wife played with usual natural charm (and only briefly) by Catherine Keener create a relatable normalcy here. In a world that is usually all hype.But then, this is New York, not Los Angeles, and so the city and its gritty realism has a large role. And a critical role, since the starving young musician who is ostensibly the largest star, played by Keira Knightley, plays her gigs on location throughout New York. So part of the movie is a kind of fast tour of groovy spots in the city, the musicians performing and recording as they go. Cool.The weak point for me was frankly the music. Most of it was invented somehow for Knightley and her makeshift band, composed by some little known music professionals behind the scenes (like Gregg Alexander). Knightley did play and sing on her own, and I guess you have to admire her picking up those new skills. But she's not great. In fact she's just as good as the average good performer in your family (and if you're a Jackson or a Cash, this doesn't apply to you). So you have to just go with the flow and the plot and promise to not care.And so it feels and looks pretty good. And has a fun final moment where the album is released and sold for a dollar on the internet (this is a small spoiler, I admit)?but it matters because if you go to get the soundtrack to the movie, it ain't a buck. It's $9.99 on iTunes, and I don't recommend it.So the whole sham of it all sinks in. This is just another vehicle for a well-worn idea and some rather decent acting in a beautiful city.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the years since A&amp;R man and record producer Dan (Mark Ruffalo) co-founded his indie record company, he has lost his way: he is estranged from his wife and daughter, he has had no musical success for some while, and he drinks far too much. After a day when all his lows get even lower, is in a bar on open mike night and hears something special in a song played by Gretta (Keira Knightley). She is an English girl, alone in New York after her boyfriend and writing partner unexpectedly hits it big after his music is used in a hit film, only for fame to go to his head. Dan persuades Gretta to let him produce an album for her, recorded live in outdoor locations around New York.That synopsis is conveyed by the trailer and, sure enough, that is pretty much what the film delivers. It gives advance notice of being an amiable sort of affair, albeit without falling obviously into an identifiable category (and rightly so - it is best described as a light drama with elements of comedy, romance, and music). And it starts out being exactly what you expect.And then something happens. It's not that it springs any great surprises on you plot-wise (although you are not entirely sure how it will end: thankfully, it avoids travelling in one of several directions which would have been very very wrong), it's more that it assaults you with charm in a very gentle way and, well before it reaches halfway, you realise that you are actually enjoying this (somewhat improbable) tale a great deal.Why is this? Well, part of the reason is that both Ruffalo and Knightley deliver engaging performances: these two rather lost characters enable each other to find themselves, albeit through unlikely means. And they are given sterling support by James Corden (as Gretta's fellow ex-pat pal), Catherine Keener and Hailey Steinfeld (as Dan's wife and daughter) and Adam Levine (as the not entirely unsympathetic boyfriend Dave.The music is pleasant enough without being exceptional (with one or two very enjoyable musical sequences), and Keira Knightley turns out to have a pleasing, if delicate, singing voice.My sole criticism is that there is a fair amount of bad language in it and virtually all of it serves no dramatic or narrative purpose, and is accordingly completely unnecessary.I recommend this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Another film about music production, and it's not as good as others of its genre. The song choices and acting are merely OK, but the notion of the love of music is just romanticized.Do Keira Knightley and Mark Ruffalo even love music? Because I just can't feel their passions in their acting. In the plot, music seemed to be the emotional outlet for the character (Gretta). But when this is portrayed in Knightley's hollow acting, her usual pretentious smirk, make me feel that she loves music just because it's cool. In short I think she faked her love of music. And practically, Knightley can't sing. She fakes it but she just can't. Her voice is so flat and her acting is disappointingly pretentious. Ruffalo is doing a better job but his decadent face always reminds me of Hulk. I love Adam Levine though, but I really think that the songs in this movie are B-graded. The original soundtrack of this movie would not be worth-buying.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My husband and I happened upon this movie while scrolling through TV options this morning. Wow! What a fantastic movie! I don't remember ever seeing it advertised; I can't imagine why it wasn't huge! It has a superb cast - both Mark Ruffalo and Keira Knightly were wonderful in their respective roles as Dan and Gretta. The music was great - seeking out the soundtrack as soon as I finish this review! :) Best of all, though, it was a feel-good movie - a heart-warming story of the resilience of the human spirit and highlighting the importance of connections with others, whether those connections are with lovers, family or friends. It's the kind of movie I could watch again and again! LOVED IT! I highly, highly recommend it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If i have to include this movie in my top ten list of musical movies, definitely i would love to include it. As an actor i really like Mark Ruffalo and he has given good performance. There are lot of sparkling moments in this movie specially when they do the album shooting throughout New York. While i was watching, i fell in love with the smile of Keira Knightley. She looked too much cute and i felt surprising that she can sing well also. If you have liked it, go for Music and Lyrics movie also. Overall it's decent movie and can be watched over weekend sipping wine or coffee with your loved ones.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Begin again" is that kind of film that gives you this sense of spiritual freedom and tranquility after you watch it. Not only is the plot interesting and original in its details, but also the feelings and emotions of the various characters are somehow complex and appealing to the psychologist in you.Enriched by its very good acting, this film leaves you thinking that you can do everything you want, inspiring you to find alternative and fascinating and even more groundbreaking ways to make your dreams come true, whenever the conventional ones do not work. You learn that whatever pit you've fallen in, it is always possible to come back alive and new with the right amount of effort, motivation and out of the box thinking, as Dan did. It is refreshing and full of joy, yet believable.What's more, it is impossible to miss the delightful music played throughout, and the wonderful way it is created. I would buy Greta's album for way more than one buck. Actually, that kind of music has no price, no company label, no campaign attached. It lives just for itself, because it is as good as all the music that comes right from the heart is, and it is capable of giving you a refreshing air of life.Capable of making you want to begin again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Whether or not you're a big music fan, I think Begin Again will be an enjoyable watch. It's actually not what I thought it would be. I expected more of a sappy romantic comedy with a whole bunch of music plugs for famous artists. Sure, there are a few of those, but it never takes away from the film in general. Plus Keira Knightley and Mark Ruffalo have great chemistry together.Ruffalo plays a washed up alcoholic record label manager. He has had his fair share of family issues and career obstacles but he has enough friends to keep him around a little longer. Knightley plays a woman grieving over her the recent break up with her boyfriend (Levine) and just hopes people hear her songs the way she hears them. The chance encounter between the two at the bar sparks an unlikely friendship and many cool songs. They decide to start a band that records their songs independently and outside in New York City. It's a pretty cool idea to have all the ambient sound in the background which gives you a true city life experience. Apparently it is Knightley singing in all these songs which is good to hear, though most have been edited in the studio. I think it would have been even better if they filmed and recorded these songs ACTUALLY outside during production of the movie. It would have given it such a natural feel to it.The film goes back and forth between Gretta's rebuilding of her life since her break up, and Dan's trouble reconnecting with his daughter and ex-wife. I liked this approach, but I do think it would have benefited more if it focused on the band and the relationship between Dan and Gretta. I didn't find the Adam Levine story to be interesting at all, in fact I think it was a pretty poor effort. But when you break the film down and realize it does what it set out to do, which is telling a story about two people who need new beginnings in their lives. It's a sweet and harmless tale that most people can enjoy.+Fascinating idea +Chemistry between our leads +Feel good film +Catchy songs -Could have actually recorded outside -Levine's storyline 7.3/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film tells the story of a record executive who has fallen out of favour, and a woman whose singer boyfriend is having an affair. Their chance encounter in a bar sparks the start of a journey that helps both of them to get back on their feet.The plot is a positive one, as everyone gets something positive out of the bad night they initially had. Mark Ruffalo gets back into the music industry, Keira Knightley gets to make an album, even the wife and the daughter of Mark Ruffalo gets a great outcome out of the experience. I like the songs in the film, but I get the feeling that there are really too much singing scenes. It was as if I was watching an extended music video. I think they do not really have to play the whole song every time, a snippet will help the soundtrack sale already.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Love this film for the performances, all of them, the sense of NYC, and, above all, the music. My favorite film of 2013 without question.Beyond the fine performances -- to be expected from Ruffalo, Knightly, Keener, Steinfeld, and Mos Def -- we have some very good work by Adam Levine and stellar music. And the English best friend chap who steals his scenes. It's a film that withstands repeated viewings -- look out for the macho tea scene -- and that begs so many great questions about love, life, art, work, children, marriage, confusion and everything that makes being on the planet worthwhile.Some will say it's a love song to NYC -- no doubt -- but for me it's a love song to music. Be on the lookout for the brother with the comb in his hair, jamming. Love love love him and any scene he's in, playing his instrument and doing this thing, brings the film from great to on fire. And Mark Ruffalo? Please, let's be sensible and give this man the Oscar he's deserved for many years now.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie caught my attention first because of its catchy quote "you are only as strong as your next move", and then because many acquaintances raved about it and posted "highly recommended" posts all over their social networks. Went with a friend who also needed boosting and a pat on the shoulder for recent hurdles. After seeing the movie, I could see why the critic reviews were so favourable. This film was laudable - the lyrics are more poetry than prose, the melodies sweetly haunting, the interaction between the characters not banal or disappointing, the soundtrack is a must- get and it left viewers with a general air of hope and rekindled the belief of victory over fate. Kudos to the team for not ruining the story with tacky romantic pairings and for keeping music, the love for music, the music lovers as the triad theme.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Haven't counted the total number songs in this film, but once you get into it a bit, it seems as if one is almost always playing. Not that it's a bad thing, for in fact, the music is one of the better parts of the movie. The story's consistently straight-forward not leaving much to get deeply involved with, and the acting follows along and pretty much gets the job done without problems (these are after all some well know names, with lots of productions to their credit). Have always liked the leads, and here they work the script as best they can. It's overall a decent way to spend an hour and forty-five minutes.. and in addition listen to some fairly decent tunes.. (some being much better than others).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lovely sound tracks. Gifted me an impetus to live on through the challenges in life. I thank 'Begin Again'.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's really about music, and how our lives are influenced by the music that we love. You know what kind of person he or she is when you listen to their playlists.I personally listened to all the soundtracks from the movie before I watched the movie at the theatre. If movie soundtracks are one of the key criterion that you are conscious with when judging the quality of a movie just like myself, I would definitely encourage you to do the same. 'Begin Again' has one of the best soundtracks that I have ever encountered. Every song has its message, and a story. (I'm not saying every one of them were my taste though)Here is a brief summary of the message that I got from the movie: Take on the punches you must take, and move on to the next moments of your life. You never know whats ahead of those brutal punches.The sensation after the movie was enormous. Harmony of those warm hearted messages and simply amazing sound tracks was more than enough to make my day. I do go harsh on movie reviews and I do admit being a strong critic, but this movie is worth the compliments. I thank 'Begin Again', for endowing me courage to take on the challenges, as well as momentum to proceed on to next 'steps that I can't take back'.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dan (Mark Ruffalo) was once a top music producer. He especially excelled in finding new talent for the company he co-founded. But, that was then, this is now. Not having discovered new artists for several years, his partner had to take more power in the company's direction, leaving Dan in a position to be fired. Also, his marriage is shaky and so is this man's relationship with his fifteen year old daughter, Violet (Heilee Steinfeld). Meanwhile, rising singing star Dave (Adam Levine) has traveled to Manhattan for a lucrative contract. With him is his longtime girlfriend and song-writing partner, Greta (Keira Knightley). With lots of new sites and experiences, the couple seems very happy. Alas, when Dave flew to California for a promotion, he had a fling with another woman. Greta is devastated. Not having any other place to go, Greta bolts to the tiny apartment of a street musician and friend, Steve (James Cornin). But, through tears, Greta realizes she doesn't have a back up plan. To cheer her up, Steve takes her to a small nightclub where he is performing. Before long, he prods Greta into singing a song on stage, too. Guess who is in the audience? That's right, Dan! Despite being in the recent habit of getting sloshed, Dan knows talent when he sees it. Therefore, at the end of the show, Dan asks Greta to record for his studio. Unfortunately, his former partner gives him the axe and a new plan is formed. Asking favors from other musicians Dan has discovered, the musical talent scout and the lovely lady from Britain start recording an album in the open air all over the city. When they are finished, they hope to strike it BIG! Will they? This lovely, very melodic movie is a great pleasure to watch. First, the cast is first rate, with Ruffalo, Knightley, Catherine Keener, Steinfeld, Cornin, and many others. Especially impressive is Levine, who has a thankless role but plays it very well. In addition, his voice is magnificent, while Knightley's renditions are beautiful, too. The setting is fun, the costumes fetching, the script heartfelt and the direction lively. Anyone will appreciate the interesting and varied shots of the action and the backdrops for the musical numbers. if you've been putting it off, don't! Begin your week with this flick, find time in the middle or end with it on the weekend. It has charms for every day of the week, month, and year.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'BEGIN AGAIN': Four Stars (Out of Five) Musical romantic comedy flick written and directed by John Carney; who also wrote and directed the critically acclaimed 2007 Irish musical 'ONCE'. Mark Ruffalo and Keira Knightley star in the movie (Knightley also did all of her own singing) as an alcoholic music executive and a singer/songwriter who collaborate on a music album; they record all live over the summer (in New York City). It costars Hailee Steinfeld, Catherine Keener, James Corden, CeeLo Green, Mos Def and Adam Levine (in his film debut). I found the movie to be really entertaining and emotionally uplifting as well.Ruffalo plays Dan Mulligan, a recently unemployed music label executive who lives in New York City. Dan is separated from his wife, Miriam (Keener), and hasn't signed a successful music artist in seven years. He also has a teenage daughter, named Violet (Steinfelf), and is an alcoholic, due to his depression. Knightley plays Gretta, a singer/songwriter who recently broke up with her longtime boyfriend, Dave (Levine). The two moved to New York because Dave was signed to a record label. He quickly let the success go to his head though and had an affair with a music label associate. Dan discovers Gretta playing one of her songs at a bar, in East Village, and immediately thinks she's the person who will help him get out of the rut he's in. The two soon decide to produce an album together.I like 'ONCE', a lot, because I really like the music and think the movie was filmed beautifully. I like this film for the same reasons; the music is great and the film looks amazing. It's also just a cool feel-good movie. I really enjoyed it, a lot, while I was watching it. Like 'ONCE', it's not a film I'll take a lot away from but it's still a really fun time at the movies. It's also one I look forward to seeing again, like a good song that you can't wait to hear again!

He's a scruffy, profane, broken-down drunk initially estranged from his wife and daughter, as well as being saddled with an unreliable cheap foreign import junker (a make that rhymes with "drag-you-car"). But playing Wendy to Dan's Lost Boy, Keira Knightley as singer\songwriter "Gretta" pops into his life out of nowhere (a.k.a., Bristol, England) as his new Muse to set things right. Though a few Holier-than-Thou.Ers walked out of my showing at the 26 minute, 20-second mark (near Dan's nadir), those who remained clapped at BEGIN AGAIN's close. This flick is no Hallmark Channel movie.

		<shortDescription>Settle With Music</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Begin Again tends to take things light and easy, despite of its harsher first act. It introduces its main characters falling down from their careers as they face the unfair reality of the music industry. Dan seeks for actual good music but the production keeps on feeding everyone the awfulness of modern mainstream because the mass would sadly swallow it no matter what, while Greta has gone to a typical celebrity relationship which won't last that long (apparently). The first thirty-minutes or so pours out the worst until they immediately find the solution to get up again. The plot sometimes move too simple, but what consists in those scenes however bring a real heart to music which easily makes the audience sway from some of its obvious flaws.Some might expect some commentary since the beginning keeps poking fun of today's popular music, but it didn't took that long. Instead of petty satires, it rather makes music as a way of expressing their various feelings. Their problems may be solved far too easy which makes the steps of the journey feel kind of underwhelming, but how they define their affections towards the music deeper than what the storyline was trying to suggest. The lead characters are given some genuine personality which makes their bonding moments wonderfully down-to-earth.The direction contemplates and perfectly follows the rhythm of the playing songs at the scenes. The songs are fine, few might be considered as memorable but they are all appealing anyway. Keira Knightly isn't known for singing, but she nicely carries her character's emotions through it, also of course at the acting. Mark Ruffalo manages to be all likable in his redeeming washed-up producer role. The rest of the cast also brims some life in their background.The risk of "beginning again" is probably too little, basically because passion to music could easily find the end of the tunnel of their sudden misery. Its eventual sheer positivity can be both a good and a bad thing. The good side is it stays true to what it is wanted to say. But still, they're still burdened with some heavy personal issues that doesn't get enough consideration, but whatever I guess. The sub-themes and all; it still delivers its message sincerely and it can be quite a charming thing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Music &amp; Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw "Begin Again", starring Mark Ruffalo-Bruce Banner in the Avengers movies, 13 Going on 30; Keira Knightley-Jack Ryan:Shadow Recruit, Domino; Adam Levine-the Maroon 5 singer that you might have also seen in American Horror Story_t.v., 30 Rock_t.v. and Hailee Steinfeld-Ender's Game, True Grit_2010.This is a story about a journey on the road to fame and success in the music business. Mark plays a burned-out record producer that has come on hard times. He used to be pretty good at his job but after some personal family problems, he started to drink a lot, and eventually lost his job. Hailee is his teen-aged daughter that is acting out in rebellion because she needs a father for guidance. Keira and Adam are a couple that have been dating since college and both have dreams of becoming famous in the music business-they are both singer/song writers. Adam gets his shot before Keira and takes off for fame and riches without her. Mark hears Keira in a small bar singing and spots the potential for great success, so he offers to produce her music for an album but she is not sure if she should trust him; he looks like a drunk, homeless man. The story line is not too original-I'm sure I've heard versions of it before-but the story is not too predictable and I enjoyed the music. Keira learned to play guitar for the role and I think I heard her say in an interview that she did her own singing-which, if it's true, is not too shabby. It's rated "R" for the language and has a running time of 1 hour &amp; 44 minutes. I enjoyed it enough that I would probably buy it on DVD.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Film opens in a bar. A shy girl, played by Keira Knightley, sings a song. In the audience is a strange looking man played by Mark Ruffalo. The film goes back in time to see how they got there. However, this is not one of those films that starts with the end scene, thus spoiling all the suspense. Here the flashbacks are done well, and cleverly, to quickly bring the viewer back to the bar, and the start of the film. Now we learn why Mr Ruffalo's character looks strange, and why Miss Knightley's character is shy.Mark Ruffalo looks very grizzled and he seems to have got his brash New York character down to a tee, despite not being a native New Yorker himself. Miss Knightley plays well the idealistic song-writer from out-of-town.The plot revolves around them getting together to produce some music. This reviewer was a little concerned that there may be too much music in this film, however this turned out to not be a problem. There are perhaps four major music scenes, one or two of which felt, to me, ever so slightly, too long. However, knowing that the film was about music, I merely gritted my teeth, very gently.Earlier this year, this reviewer saw Miss Knightley in 'Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit' and although playing against Kenneth Branagh, Kevin Costner and Chris Pine, she more than held her own in scenes, some of which were exciting, and some sweet.Miss Knightley prepared thoroughly for her role in 'Begin Again'. IMDb quotes her as saying she was taught guitar by her husband but that it led to disharmony in the relationship. In an interview, Miss Knightley says that she learnt all her lines prior to shooting, but when filming started, Writer/Director John Carney decided to do a lot of improvisation. What were lines, and what was improvisation, is unclear. Certainly the early singing scenes seem authentic and it must be hoped that the sweet-voiced Miss Knightley does have her songs released, in reality, outside of this film.John Carney directs well. The film is meant to be low-budget, but it looks good. It has an almost documentary feel, especially in some of the music scenes. This is conveyed by the camera-work. Small hand-held cameras seem to have been well utilized to give an authentic look. There are none of the dreadful dizzying spinning shots that some directors think are needed to give an authentic documentary look. This is all achieved by the way the cameras are used. There is a street-guerrilla-look to the filming that fits in perfectly with the theme of street-guerrilla music-making and thus gives it authenticity.The main stars are also supplemented by a good supporting cast. James Corden convinces in his role as another musician and the scenes between him and fellow Brit Miss Knightley seem very natural. Mr Ruffalo too has some great scenes with Hailee Steinfeld and Catherine Keener. Again they seem authentic and believable. An early scene with Mr Ruffalo and Miss Steinfeld is one of the funniest in the film. So there is some comedy too, in this film about music. There is also nice interaction between Miss Knightley and Miss Steinfeld.One of the main themes of the film is relationships. Miss Knightley plays a character who seems very sensitive, perceptive and empathetic. Thus through her, we the audience can quickly pick up the vibes and follow the plot. Mr Ruffalo, last year also made 'Now You See Me', in which he played a hard-boiled detective hunting down some bank-robbing magicians, however his character did have some charm. Here too, in this film, Mr Ruffalo gives us charm with his native New Yorker character, who also has a more realistic gritty bad-boy side to him as well.This film about artists at work, and their lives and loves, is one that surpassed my expectations. The relationships were dealt with in a realistic way and the comedy and the music were both pleasant. Perhaps not a rom-com, this is though a nice film, that is both emotional and entertaining, as well as making some comment on current music trends.A good film which surpassed my expectations. 10/10.Warning: Film contains beards. Advice: Stay to see the end-credits.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lovely Song</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I walked out of this movie feeling like I was young all over again! When Dan's ears picked up in the bar, I was in perfect sync as well. The tune was pure magic and you would never know that Greta was anything other than an inspired writer. What I love most about Americans is their unbelievable entrepreneurial spirit and this is in evidence in spades here. I remember reading an autobiography about Twyla Tharp, a famous choreographer. She said something to the effect that "those who the gods seek to punish, they give infinite resources". This is the theme of this movie and why sometimes even if you are at the bottom of the barrel, it may be the best place to be from a creativity point of view. I loved all the characters in this film, they felt totally natural. Keira Knightley was a perfect Greta, unaffected and innocent. Mark Ruffalo was also very believable, someone who life had dealt many terrible hands, but rises about it all putting all the misery behind him and grabbing the riches of life in the present. Violet was a great guitarist, CeeLoo Green made me feel happy and Steve was the friend everyone wishes they had. Right on.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I enjoyed this feel good movie. It was easy to watch and did not drag. Keirah Knightly has a new fan- me. She is kind of adorable. Her smile is really appealing and her delivery of the dialogue was superb as was the subtlety of her evanescent facial expressions. I liked the assertiveness and gentleness of her character too. Mark Ruffalo was excellent too, and the chemistry between the two that was really engaging. Keira is married to a real life rockstar. Her authenticity might have been enhanced by real life experience. I hope that was her singing because it was really good. She has total star quality and although Ruffalo was great too I could not take my eyes of Ms Knightly, not just because of her beauty but because of her acting skills and the clear projection of her voice. This movie is worth seeing and there were no guns, thank goodness. There was no violence either and very little bitterness. All this is very refreshing. Thanks to the people who made this entertaining show.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dan used to be an maverick indie record producer and family man. However, time and luck turn against him in both aspects of his life. Greta is an idealistic singer-songwriter whose musician boyfriend Dave went astray when he gets entangled with the glare and trappings of commercial fame. Dan and Greta meet each other at the very depth of their depression. But this fortuitous meeting would bring about a chain of events which may lead to a mutual reversal of fortunes for these two free-spirited individuals. Will these lost stars align once again with their collaboration? These backgrounds of the lead characters are reminiscent of writer- director John Carney's breakthrough 2006 indie film, the delicate "Once." The story was also about musicians who led sad lives until they meet and click musically. The storytelling was propelled by the beautiful songs they sing. In "Begin Again" though, Carney's first Hollywood film, the setting is upgraded from suburban Ireland to New York City, and the cast is upgraded to A-list stars.Mark Ruffalo perfectly captures the broken character of Dan, gruff exterior and deep-set cynicism. However, he has this goofy charm that makes you actually root for him to dig himself out of his hole. He seems to have genuine chemistry with all his co-stars, a rare quality.Keira Knightley started so well in her career, but lately her talent has not been given the right roles to shine. Greta is such an awesome character for Keira, who I am sure no one even thought could sing so well. Everything she sings here I liked and I would like to hear over and over. Beautiful songs all.Adam Levine plays the erring boyfriend Dave well considering this is his first major movie role. His singing was of course flawless in very catchy songs like the centerpiece tune "Lost Stars", which is this film's answer to "Falling Slowly" from "Once", certainly a contender for Oscar Best Song as well.James Corden plays Greta's best friend in New York Steve. He provides the comic relief very subtly, a very nice guy. Catherine Keener plays Dan's ex-wife Miriam, who made the most of her little screen time. Hailee Steinfeld plays Dan's confused daughter Violet. Cee-Lo also has a marked cameo as one of Dan's former successful talents.Like "Once", "Begin Again" is a film that is simply so refreshing and delightful midst all the big and noisy summer blockbusters. The story does not seem so original, that is true. However again, the unbelievably effective cast and the beautiful musical soundtrack both uplift the common story into a much higher level. If the songs speak to you, then you will love this movie. I definitely did. 9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bottom then up</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What does one need when hitting rock bottom? Someone else who touched bottom too.A disgruntled music producer is going through the worst day of his life, having been fired from the company he founded as well as realising he is not doing a great job as a father also. In an already half intoxicated state he walk into a bar and he hears an unknown singer; suddenly he has hope for the future. It turns out that the singer that impressed him was in the doldrums as well, having just split up from a long term boyfriend.This chance encounter leads to a collaboration, thus filling them with a renewed sense of hope for the future. The obstacles are many, the means pretty much non-existent. Still, two people with nothing to lose will find a way and pull few strings to make it happen.Whilst I can see why it has delighted critics and audiences alike, I do not quite share the prevailing enthusiasm. Don't get me wrong, the main thrust of this (two people who hit bottom trying to pick themselves up) was relatively effective, it is just that a lot of time was devoted to the main characters internal conflicts as opposed to getting a stronger sense of beginning again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A tribute to music and love</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Keira Knightley, an artist for whom I have so much love and respect, and Mark Ruffalo an actor I've been watching with a lot of confusion. I was more curious about the mix, than the movie itself. With a trailer not giving away much, and a Adam Levine I can't trust with acting, watching this movie was a choice I made actually to find sleep. But what a good surprise! Begin again is a tribute to good Music. Dan (Mark Ruffalo), a producer who's fed up with the lack of consistency and depth in today's music, struggles to convince his business partner of his point, and decides to just quit. In a hopeless try to drown his pain at a bar, finds Gretta (Keira Knightley) singing with a guitar the exact music he's been looking for. At this point It may seem like a classic boring scenario where a producer discovers what's going to be the revelation of the year, sign her, they sell millions and win awards, but it's not. It's more than that, it's not even close to that. It's the quest of finding oneself, falling in love again with people that matter, and paying a tribute to good Music. I talk about Music with a real band playing drums, violin, cello and piano. The music full of love and joy and magic of the enchanting Frank Sinatra, that Michael Buble and Norah Jones tried to save for our pleasure, and that we're dying to listen to today. As a bonus a very sweet OST.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A musical feast. A must watch for music lovers. The film shows the tussle between an artist's intrinsic love for music and the commercial interest taking over the purity of music from him/her. How giving a hit becomes more important than making real music. vivid representation of making of an open album with so many sweet lovely songs . Awesome Keira steeling the show with her natural acting and amazing voice. I never knew she can sing so well. And Mark has given such a natural performance. The movie also touches on some other issues like free music vs music companies making money from commercialization of music that sometimes may be detrimental to the music itself and for the artist too.

		<fullReview>This is a pretty solid film all around. The performances are solid, the music is solid, the writing is solid. But none of its aspects are truly outstanding though, and when compared to the beautifully moving Once, it pales in comparison. Once was just more heartfelt, more realistic, and the music is in a league of its own. Still, it's not right to just compare it to Once, even if it is similar in superficial ways. This one blends in more elements into the story, including their personal problems and it also ventures into more mainstream-levels. I wouldn't say that this is a must-see by ay means, but it gets the job done. Recommended.</fullReview>

Greta moves to New York wit her boyfriend Dave played by Adam Levine and the duo hope to start off their careers. However when Dave is given a big break, he dumps Greta leaving her on her own.

		<shortDescription>A Rom Com with a Difference from the Music Man</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although he intentionally waited several years after the release of his critically acclaimed Sundance Film Festival Audience Award-winning 2006 effort Once in an effort to avoid being labelled the 'music guy', there is no escaping the fact that it is another music driven narrative in Begin Again that has put Irish writer/director John Carney firmly back in the spotlight. Of course, the lack of success of his in-between efforts ? wacky comedy Zonad and supernatural drama The Rafters ? outside of his home territory certainly hasn't helped Carney in his efforts to avoid being pigeon-holed. Carney's return to the modern musical genre has resulted in a film that, whilst a romantic comedy of sorts and a celebration of the power of music, is also a far-from-subtle attack on the contemporary music industry. Featuring Mark Ruffalo as Dan, a disillusioned and dishevelled record label executive, the film skewers the industry and presents most of those working within it ? Dan notwithstanding of course ? as slaves to the almighty dollar who privilege style and image over substance and talent.For Dan, excessive alcohol consumption, tardiness and a general disdain for an industry in which he was once an influential and inspirational figure has resulted in him being banished from his own company ? Distressed Records ? a label he founded with partner Saul (Mos Def) some 20-odd years before. Drowning his sorrows in a bar, Dan stumbles across Gretta (Keira Knightley) a British songwriter freshly separated from her on-the-verge-of-success musician boyfriend Dave (Maroon 5's Adam Levine). Whilst both Dan and Gretta share a cynicism about the state of the music industry, he recognises her talents as a singer and songwriter and sees her as a potential shot at redemption. However, Gretta certainly doesn't share Dan's affirmation of her talents and certainly has no interest in releasing any of her music, let alone securing a record deal. Of course, as they must if we are going to have a story, things change and the pair join forces in an effort to make ? or remake in Dan's case ? their mark; all the while refusing to conform to the conventions that often only serve to constrain creativity. As we have come to expect, Dan's personal and professional disintegration has also left him estranged from his wife and daughter and this new project serves as an opportunity to reconnect with both.In the first part of the film, Ruffalo is completely over-the-top in his portrayal of Dan, presenting him as an utterly unlikeable caricature, somebody for whom it is difficult to muster any sympathy. To his credit though, Ruffalo somehow turns it around and by the end of the film you are totally enamoured by his character and the talent, drive and charm that has been buried beneath layers of self-loathing. The under-rated Knightley is charming and naturalistic as Gretta, while Levine is effective enough as the dastardly Dave. As ex-wife Miriam, the always reliable Catherine Keener is equal parts admiration, frustration and sympathy for Dan, while Hailee Steinfeld is teenage daughter Violet, struggling in her search for identity and her own place in the world. James Corden (One Chance) and CeeLo Green bring a sense of fun to the piece as musician friends of Gretta and Dave respectively, albeit at opposite ends of the success spectrum. Unlike Dan, Mos Def's Saul is willing to accept and embrace change; a not altogether unreasonable man who is prepared to put the company's interests ahead of his own. Rob Morrow (Quiz Show and TV's Northern Exposure), meanwhile, makes a brief appearance as a music executive who is an incarnation of everything that is wrong with the industry today.The songs are fabulous and there is every chance that Begin Again could emulate the success of Once in the Best Original Song category at the Academy Awards with Lost Stars (penned by Gregg Alexander, Danielle Brisebois, Nick Lashley and Nick Southwood) driving so much of the story. The glorious New York locations are a visual feast and also play a pivotal role in the creative process for Dan, Gretta and the merry band of musicians who sign up for their somewhat radical approach to recording. There are plenty of nice moments, such as when a classically trained cellist roped into the group is more than willing to accept a percentage of profits instead of upfront payment "as long as it's not Vivaldi." With musings on how music can invest banal moments with deep meaning and a nod to magic realism, Begin Again is a charming film that is fun and funky despite its flaws.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's great counterprogramming for the summer.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off, I really wish they had stuck with the original title "Can A Song Save Your Life?", because that's actually what the film is about. Begin Again makes little to no sense as a title, and seems to be taken from a hat full of torn up pieces of paper with intentionally vague movie titles. This same hat clearly was responsible for super vague thrillers named 'Paranoia', 'Deception', and the trifecta of films coming to theatres with 'If' in the title (What If, If I Stay, and If Only). It makes a movie more bland to have a bland title that has nothing to do with the film.No one in this film technically "begins" again. In fact, Ruffalo's character goes back to his old life almost immediately, using Knightley's character as a way to weasel himself back into his old label. He doesn't use it as a new start, rather it's more of a do-over. Second Chance would have made more sense.Most of my problems lie in the fact that I really hate the title. I hate that they lost the particularly original title for an extremely bland title. The film was anything but extremely bland, often choosing to take the harder path in storytelling. This is a romance, but not a straightforward romance. This is two broken people coming together, who just might end up with the people they were with at the beginning of the film. And that's completely OK, because of the way these characters are written. Ruffalo isn't some creepy old dude trying to bang Knightley. He's into her because of her songwriting skills, and not her body. In fact, for the majority of the film, we wonder if Ruffalo has even noticed that Knightley is hot. It's possible that has escaped him.Knightley is surprisingly good in this. She's struggled getting recognition for her work in the past few years, often being overshadowed by her male co-stars. Her last great role was probably Atonement, but she was also good in Never Let Me Go, The Duchess, and A Dangerous Method, though you probably forgot all of those films. Here, she actually outshines Ruffalo, who is still quite good as a depressed, struggling record exec/divorced father. I have a hard time gushing over Ruffalo here, when I just saw him at his career best in A Normal Heart.Adam Levine is surprisingly good in his supporting role. He does have some acting chops, and isn't a complete waste on the screen. Keener is always good playing a frumpy wife, divorced or not. Steinfeld is good, but probably wasted as a moody teenager. Corden is slowly breaking through in America, and this role is a nice role to add to his resume, though I doubt he'll be remembered for it.It's great counterprogramming for the summer. It's not like anything else you'll see this summer, and it is dangerously different from other romantic comedies. I mean, it takes balls to make some of these choices, and I appreciate that John Carney doesn't take the easy road out.As far as whether or not a song can save your life, I suppose the answer is yes, because as the film shows us, music evokes emotion. It can remind us of a previous event, or a different place and time. The right song at the right time can most certainly save a life. Even if your life isn't in danger, the right song can most certainly cheer up your day. The right movie? Those can stay with you forever.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let me start by telling you that John Carney has done an amazing job of this movie. The little details all came together to make such a good production.All of the acting is this movie is really, really good. Especially Mark Ruffalo who plays a very interesting character. Even Adam Lavine of Maroon 5 plays his character very well. Which, to be honest I wasn't expecting. I would like to see him in some more movies and he is well suited to the part he plays in Begin Again.The soundtrack is great and has some all time classics in it. I won't say too much but, if they release a soundtrack to the movie I would recommend buying it.Overall I would recommend going to the cinema to see this film as it has a good story line, some great acting and it is thoroughly enjoyable. Please keep an eye out for my other reviews. I am going to watch Hurcules on Friday night so, I will be reviewing that over the weekend (Or Monday).</fullReview>

Not really a fan of Keira Knightley; I thought she was horrible in 'seeking a friend for the end of the world' - I didn't believe in her character - but in this film? Knightley was really good in my opinion - I liked her and felt I understood her. Good work by all. My husband loved Adam Levine's voice (we don't know anything about him or his songs before - gonna check him out now). So, all in all a worthwhile and enjoyable experience, modern and not really Hollywood blockbuster style romcom at all. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

Yet for some reason, when I sat in the theater to screen this film, I could not help but send chill after chill down my spine.It's not one of those films that awkwardly fuse performance and film (in the way that the storyline is insignificant over the performance - namely the StepUp series). Every song, every lyric, every melody blends in naturally with the flow of the story, and the emotions of the characters are so detailed. The acting is perfect, but so is the atmosphere in each scene. I can't say that I have one favorite movie, but if I had to choose, it would definitely be this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I normally dislike films with conventional plots such as Begin Again, but I have never been more surprised with one. The story, yes, is a bit conventional and you feel like you know where it is going before it shows you, but it doesn't end taking the conventional route of romance and drama. It's fresh to see a film that takes a simple plot and spreads it out layering it for the audience to see and speculate of. I was quite pleasantly surprised to see that nobody dramatically fell in love because a script demanded them to, but they interacted as makes sense. The actions of the characters felt very genuine.I will briefly talk of the cinematography and such because even though it is generally composed in a conventional style that makes one comfortable, the shot composition is actually quite interesting in that I noticed a few occurrences in which two characters would be having a conversation but the shot was wide and constant with no cuts. I understand it's not some sort of ground breaking style, but it feels fresh for it to be in a film like this.It was entertaining, pleasantly surprising, funny, charming, slightly self aware, and intelligent. It was simply a fantastic film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was simply brilliant, in the top 1% of all movies I've seen. It begins when the producer imagines the musical arrangement he'd make for her, and continues when she slaps her boyfriend after hearing his new song, knowing he'd been unfaithful. Every scene with dual headphones is wonderful. It ends perfectly with the family band. It's obvious that two of the characters will find romance, but it isn't clear that it will be the right pair til the end.There's no memorable hit sing like "Falling Slowly" in "Once," but I don't think that matters. (Maybe it means they won't ruin it with a Broadway version.)Mark Ruffalo is at his best; Keira Knightley emerges as the British Zooey Deschanel, a triple threat in singing, drama and comedy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dumped, broke, fired, punched, dreams crushed, drunk, estranged from loved ones, no place to stay, cheated on, alienated and/or alone, the main characters of this film, Greta and Dan, are both extremely down on their luck. Yet these two who wear their hearts on their sleeves and bring life to those around them, in their own unusual ways, encounter each other by chance. They begin to work their odd magic on each other. From the innovative, insightful, visionary, perceptive and independent director of "Once," a film I enjoyed immensely, I was again ? much as I tried to resist high expectations - transported to a romantic, musical, surreal realm. The alluring pulse of the music, beautiful scenes from the streets of New York, the unexpected twists and turns of the story, the evident chemistry between Keira Knightley and Mark Ruffalo, interesting dialogue, and naturalistic shots that provided the feeling that I was a part of the film rather than merely watching it, delighted and charmed me to no end. This film is more than a musical, emotions are communicated through songs that come from the hearts of the characters. Keira and Mark are astounding. Keira breaks up with her boyfriend in a look, and pulls it off. A film for the humble and supportive people who, when they fall down, have others who take the opportunity to pile more troubles upon them. Seen at the 2013 Toronto International Film Festival.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You've got to hand it to Keira Knightly; not content with spending twenty-one years proving she can't act she now goes one better and removes another string from a badly depleted bow by proving she can't sing either. I actually shelled out good money to watch this because someone told me that the soundtrack featured Frank Sinatra performing Luck Be ALady. That was true enough albeit it was truncated and for good measure we also got abridged versions of two more REAL songs, As Time Goes By and For Once In My Life. And there lies the main flaw in the film. The two leads, Keightly and Mark Ruffalo play respectively a performer (I use the word loosely) and a failed record producer. Having spent an hour or so producing little more than sounds set to a beat they suddenly decide to reveal to each other the kind of music they actually listen to in private and this is where we get the three 'standards' mentioned above. What is totally bewildering, however, is that having shown they are both aware and appreciative of real music they proceed to return to the dross they have been turning out rather than attempting to emulate Loesser, Hupfield etc. I have no doubt this will find its audience though you probably won't see them in daylight.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Having a bad day? This the movie to watch. Though be aware! there is quite all to follow</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Music for a fairytale This is quite a dangerous movie to watch. Young and still hoping, those who believe that they are meant to be someone bigger than just an average human, those poor kids, they might actually face some consequences after watching the film. Basically "Begin Again" is a modern day fairytale. Extremely likable and even at some point charming characters battle all the life obstacles in order to rich the happy-ending finale. And there is nothing wrong with that. Ultimately that is what we, people, sometimes need. We need to believe, to hope. Or just enjoy a good movie. Any way. After watching the film you have two options. First, you can decide to leave the cinema in high-spirited mood, be energized by all the joy and love that was happening on the big screen and just feel amazing for the rest of your day. The film is so full of positivity that actually that might work. But there is another option. Those who are still young and hoping (or not that young but still hoping, no difference), especially musicians. There must be a warning for you. The story seems so flawless and believable that a reasonable question might appear: Why I can't do things they do? Why I don't see any upcoming happy-ending for me? Good questions. After asking them and even may be finding the right answers the young and the hoping can easily drown is such nasty feelings as disappointment, frustration and sadness. But what does it say about the movie? It says that it is an amazing movie! Something that can touch people's hearts is definitely worth watching. "Begin Again" actually makes you believe that all this music is possible. Even though all these "scary" though might come to one's head, it gives hope, hope for something extraordinary to happen. Music here is a modern-day magic and you believe that it can create miracles. And even if there is only one kid who goes out of the cinema and writes a song, starts a band, learns how to play guitar, does whatever it takes to chase his dream, the mission of the film is accomplished. So no matter who you are, what your dreams and goals are- this movie is for you, for sure you will enjoy it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the story of two aspiring musicians in New York City. Unfortunately, is isn't very well-written. Writer/director Andrew Carney, who also created Once, just isn't a good writer. The on screen talent is there; Mark Ruffalo, Kiera Knightly, Adam Levine, but film is a collaborative medium. The footage of the lower East Side of New York City is probably this movie's best feature. It recalls Manhattan. What can you say about a movie that makes these three actors look their worst and puts them in a series of not very believable situations? We are supposed to believe that you can put Kiera Knightly in a small club and have her perform a song but people will not look at her because she isn't wearing makeup. You'd have to get someone with much worse bone structure to make that even believable. We are supposed to believe that Mark Ruffalo is a successful music industry figure who wants music to be free. That's not what they were known for. Supposedly Kiera Knightly objects to wearing makeup to the point that she'd rather fail in her profession. It's not like someone asked her to dress up like Rihanna. The things the characters are supposedly fighting for seem less than believable, or even necessary. You hear a lot of music. Unfortunately, it is vapid and forgettable. This makes the plot even more unlikely. Supposedly there are issues about musical integrity. That plot line just doesn't work because the actual music is vapid. I saw this movie because it was the only thing in the theaters that would appeal to a grown up woman in months. I guess is was better than not seeing a movie, but not as good as a good movie.</fullReview>
