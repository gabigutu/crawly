		<fullReview>One reviewer remarked how "Ed Harris understands (the) Western (genre)" I couldn't agree more. This film is a delight. The writing is solid, the dialog sparked with humor, the heroes are more than caricatures and cardboard cut-outs, the villains are worthy anti-heroes and the back-up is wonderful. The performances of Ed Harris, Viggo Mortensen and Jeremy Irons as the main protag-/antagonists are sterling. Harris is the lonely paladin, uncompromising in his ethic, drawn in by the warmth and softness of a needful woman, artfully and convincingly played by Renee Zellweger; Mortensen is the slightly jaded sidekick who both respects and doesn't completely understand his hero. A parallel villain is offered by Lance Henrikson, a kind of poor man's Clint Eastwood, giving an interesting twist to the story. Some comic relief is offered by veteran character actor, James Gammon and fine British actor Timothy Spall without reducing the tension in the story line or reverting to a burlesque. The mythic theme of the knight-errant works well in this presentation brought to light by the competent direction of Ed Harris. My only fear is that it being devoid of ballet-type ritual killings, CGI and only a mild spattering of violence, it will likely fly under the radar of much of today's theater goers, which is a shame. It's a fine film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Real Western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw Appaloosa last night. Absolutely fantastic. Whether it is because he is a bit older I don't know, but Ed Harris obviously actually understands westerns.A straightforward western tale with very little revisionism, with real men doing "what men have to do". The sense of space, the wish to be part of civilization, the bad men resisting that encroachment, the sense of the mythic; it was all there.A little bit more modern in approach than a classic 50's tale, particularly in how Renée Zellwegger's character developed, but a real story nevertheless; good guys, bad guys. Jeremy Irons is very good as the baddie. Timothy Spall is good comic relief and Ed Harris and Vigo Mortensen a terrific pair, carefully nurturing their relationship while understanding exactly what they have to do.The pace was very good, allowing the story and character to develop properly. Even so, it could have and should have been shorter - John Ford, or more likely Anthony Mann would have got through this story in about 90 minutes, but very satisfying nevertheless.Costner did a pretty good job on Open Range (that was really miles too long), 3:10 to Yuma was pathetic (why they bothered to remake it when the makers so totally misunderstood the thrust of the original I will never know).But this was the real deal, or at least as near to the real deal as we are ever likely to get nowadays. Too bad it will disappear without a trace.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An old school western that more than gets the job done. It's a tour de "fource" for Ed Harris</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Films are made for us to escape to a new reality, whether that reality be complete fantasy, present day, the future, or in this case, the good old West. What we have here is a great western that looks and feels like a classic in the making, an old school western with an old school touch of directing (and acting) from Ed Harris. Appaloosa is very accessible in a film genre that isn't so accessible. It's a straightforward film that, despite that, never becomes predictable and formulaic. Harris's wonderful job on all fronts make Appaloosa one of the most complete films of the year. It's got it all, great writing, killer acting, and a great atmosphere that allows the viewer to get trapped in this old western world.Set in 1882 New Mexico, Appaloosa follows the fate of the town of the same name, which has fallen into the control of a ruthless outlaw (Jeremy Irons), and the powers that be have hired new hands to take control of the situation (Harris and Viggo Mortensen). However, when a mysterious widow (Renee Zellweger) arrives in town, loyalties will be tested, friendships will be put on trial, and guns will be fired.The strong point, as I've said, is Ed Harris, who pulls the quadruple threat of acting, directing, writing, and producing. Despite all the work he did on this film, he still manages to turn in an Oscar worthy performance as the steadfast and unwavering commander of the town. Harris is subtle, nuanced, and never out of control. He commands the screen every time he's on it, without yelling or doing anything too crazy. Viggo Mortensen's near silent performance is not short on talent either, as one of silent acting's kings continues to show incredible versatility (the guy is a fantasy king, Russian mobster, and now an old west Deputy Marshall). To complete the trifecta of greatness, Jeremy Irons is the only guy I can imagine in the role of the film's villain. His freezing stare, mixed with the icy cold voice he is most known for, makes him one of the most memorable villains of the year.Renee Zellweger really didn't add anything to the movie, though her character wasn't too interesting, and just serves as a plot device. This is what keeps the film from getting that "10" from me. The rest of the supporting cast is really a non-issue, as the story really only revolves around a few characters.What I enjoyed most about the film is that it really made me feel like I was out west...right down to the little details, such as sandstorms, the presence of Native Americans, small drawls from the actors (thankfully none besides Zellweger had a bad one), and the different kinds of horses &amp; guns in the film. Harris keeps the film moving nicely, and there's only a few moments where I felt it dragged a bit. Like I've said, it's hard to find a real fault here...the film is just well done all around, from a production standpoint.When all is said and done, I knew how I felt about this film the second the lights went on. I clapped and said, "that was great". Appaloosa is an old school western that has everything a fan of the genre could want...including a suspenseful and tense gunfight and crazy Native Americans on horses! It's definitely one of the most complete westerns and films I've seen this year, and should be in contention for a few awards come Oscar season.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Adaptation of Parker's novel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love all of Robert B. Parker's novels and I have a lot of respect for the craft of Ed Harris. This movie was a very faithful rendering of the book. Harris didn't get in the way of the storytelling rather he gave it a strong visualization. As the novel as written, the story is actually told through the eyes of Everett Hitch, played here by Viggo Mortenson. I love the way, even though he is somewhat of a side-kick, he was allowed to remain the viewpoint character. My only complaint was Renee as Allie. Reading the book I visualized a Faye Dunaway at 35. Diane Lane would have been more in line with the way the character was written in the novel. Renne struck me as a little too coquettish and obviously needy rather than manipulative and needy. It's a matter of taste but I would have preferred it. However, the rest of the casting was spot on and I hope Harris considers doing the sequel, "Resolution."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Appaloosa is based on the 2005 novel of the same name written by Robert B. Parker. It's directed by Ed Harris, who also co-writes the story with Robert Knott. Harris also stars alongside Viggo Mortensen, Renée Zellweger, Jeremy Irons &amp; Lance Henriksen. Music is by Jeff Beal and Dean Semler provides cinematography on location in Albuquerque, Austin and Santa Fe.Appaloosa is in the grip of bully boy rancher Randall Bragg (Irons), who finally oversteps the mark when the latest Marshall and his deputies are killed in cold blood. The townsfolk decide enough is enough and hire no nonsense travelling lawmen Virgil Cole (Harris) and his sidekick Everett Hitch (Mortensen) to protect and serve the town. Ruling with a rod of iron, Cole &amp; Hitch start to bring order to Appaloosa, but the arrival in town of pretty Allie French (Zellweger) causes quite a stir between the two men. Bad timing too since the guys are trying to get Bragg to his rightful execution.In the modern era the Western has been the hardest genre for film makers to tackle. You can probably count on one hand the number of great or agreeable ones that have surfaced post Costner and Eastwood's efforts of 1990 and 1992 respectively. Enter Ed Harris, who undaunted by the long odds of getting a Western to be successful; and suffering worrying overtures from his backers at New Line Cinema, got Appaloosa made. Well made as it happens.Since the story itself is etched like the Wyatt Earp legend, there's really no fresh perspective on offer here. In fact, anyone familiar with Edward Dmytryk's excellent Warlock from 1959 will feel some narrative déj? vu. But Appaloosa does have strong performances and lush landscapes to see it successfully home. Slotting in a good helping of action, romance and humour also goes some way to making Harris' movie a worthy modern day Oater. True, the clichés are many, but Harris wasn't after revisionism, he wanted (and got) old fashioned Oater values. A film that follows those old beloved B movie Western conventions, but one that still retains a topical criminal thread.The best reward in the film comes from spending time with Harris &amp; Mortensen. Their characters are nicely drawn and not over cooked by the script. Cole &amp; Hitch are devoted to each other, lots of straight love and respect exists between the two men. Their bond is believably brought to life by Harris &amp; Mortensen, who formed a friendship when making A History Of Violence for David Cronenberg in 2005. Zellweger and Irons too are not without high merit value. She (stepping in when Diane Lane walked over delays), is pleasing and captivates in what is the critical glue role. While he is dandy dastardly supreme, a well spoken villain of much intelligence and crafty as a cat.Appaloosa is a subtle film, both in story and as a technical production. Beal's score is unobtrusive, while Semler's photography manages to deliver that old fashioned feel that Harris was after (the low lighting for the interiors is particularly on the money) . Harris' direction is smooth and unhurried in pace, with the odd inspired bit thrown in for good measure (check out the up-tilt camera work during a train on a bridge sequence). While the production design can't be faulted. All that and you got the likes of Henriksen and Timothy Spall in the support cast too. A lovely film that is as tight as the friendship at its core. 7.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An OK western but a great character study</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Appaloosa as a western is okay, as a movie its okay, but as a character study it's great. Ed Harris and Viggo Mortensen are two of the most underrated actors (not stars) in Hollywood. Viggo should have had two or three Oscars by now. His rendition of Everett Hitch made the whole movie more than worthwhile. He's a man of little words but great thought. He also an observant man, of things and people. He's loyal but with practicality. He knows what the two of them do and why they do it and he know enough about Virgil not to step on his toes. But he also knows when to say what he as to say and leave it at that. I'm never that impressed by Renee Zellweger but in this movie she sort of fit in. 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Finally, a western by people who understand real conflict</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I suppose this film is as vulnerable to deep analysis as the next one, but, why bother? This is entertainment the way I like it, straight up without a lot of foolish over the top action. The real west must have been fraught with similar dilemmas as that confronting the town of Appaloosa: What to do with a lawless band of men determined to live as they please by preying on timid town dwellers? I doubt there were many men like Virgil Cole or his partner Everett Hitch in the real west having lived among their great, great grandchildren (I've no idea what the real genealogy is) for a time, but men have often tried to live like they do with the result that they lived undeservedly short lives. Still, guys like me can't get enough of their stories and Ed Harris apparently feels the same way. Only Clint Eastwood in my memory has attempted to tap into this same wellspring of folklore as in The Unforgiven. Though we all love Clint, I'd have to say Ed outdoes him here. He's got a wonderful sense of what a real gunfight might have been like. And though he's trimmed off the cries of pain and the gore, it still has the ring of truth.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Compelling and Weird Western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>On the immediate surface "Apaloosa" occurs as an old school Western grounded in the battle of good against evil. For the most part first time director/ writer Ed Harris's "Apaloosa" is the traditional tale of gunslingers hired to protect the town against the malevolent rancher, who terrorizes the town of Apaloosa. This slithery and wily Rancher is Randall Bragg, well played by Academy Award Winner Jeremy Irons. Irons is amazing. In the opening Bragg (Irons) kills the town Marshall and his deputies in cold blood. So there is no question surrounding Bragg's character. Harris and Viggo Mortensen play Virgil Cole and Everett Hitch, who are lawmen for hire. The town of Apaloosa signs a contract with Virgil and Everett paying them to protect the town from Bragg. As part of the deal Apaloosa surrenders legal jurisdiction and autonomy to Cole and Hitch. This is pretty straight forward until femme fatale widow Allison French (Renee Zellwegger) arrives in town. Virgil takes a quick fancy to Allison, but her motives are vague and questionable at best. Will she threaten Virgil's partnership with Everett? First off, I ultimately liked "Apaloosa", because Viggo Mortensen is awesome as Everett. Despite the movie's quirky idiosyncrasies, Mortensen commands the heroic presence as the sensible man of honor. Mortensen is the Western hero in the tradition of Clint Eastwood. As Everett, we always know where Mortensen stands, and he is both charismatic and cool. In a great scene a rival asks Everett about Virgil's gun prowess. Everett says plainly, "I haven't seen anyone as good as Virgil." Mortensen's Virgil salvages the movie's sense of honor.As mentioned previously, "Apaloosa" is not really all that traditional just below the surface. And this is not necessarily a good thing. This is not the anti-hero masterpiece of Clint Eastwood's "Unforgiven". In one sense, I think Harris would like it to be. For one thing although Harris's Virgil is brave and noble, he is an apparent partial nut job. He goes nonlinear on some hoods in a saloon, among other weird out bursts. Harris's Virgil is not an educated man, and clumsily forces his diction and stumbles through Emerson. Instead of coming off as charmingly eccentric, his Virgil occurs as a little weird. Renee Zellwegger is an amazing actress, but here she struggles to carry off pretty. Her character Allison also has the propensity to have sex with virtually any man with a pulse. Straight and narrow Virgil in love with psycho whore Allison is not the most conventional love story, nor is it the story's most endearing plot line. Again, this may be more artifact of the screenplay by Harris and Robert Knot based on Robert B. Parker's best selling novel.In spite of its quirkiness and kind of nutty characters, Harris manages to reign in the movie as it concludes-- opting for the more heroic. There is a great scene before one the climatic showdowns where Allison asks Virgil and Everett, "Aren't either of you at all afraid?" Virgil says, "?I guess I don't think about that so much." Also in "Apaloosa" the action is not leveraged for the utmost drama. Director Harris's action sequences lack crispness?the gun fight blocking is mostly single shot, without any interesting angles. Aside from the last gun fight, most of the action is diluted of high drama. The action is well done, just not spectacular."Apaloosa" is an amalgamation of the traditional Western with the idiosyncratic melodrama of the new. The overall effect is compelling, and also makes you scratch your head. Viggo Mortensen's strong and charismatic performance as Everett Hitch eventually wins out, and makes "Apaloosa" worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Intelligent but draggy Western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In "Appaloosa," which is set in the New Mexican territory of 1882, Ed Harris and Viggo Mortensen are a pair of frontier lawmen hired by the citizens of Appaloosa to wrest control of the town from a gang of ruffians (led by Jeremy Irons) after they shoot down the marshal and his deputies in cold blood. Renee Zellweger also shows up as a promiscuous widow who captures the eye and eventually the heart of the newly appointed sheriff (Harris).Co-written by Harris and Robert Knott (from a novel by Robert B. Parker) and directed (rather ploddingly) by Harris, "Appaloosa" pays homage to the time-honored traditions of the Western genre, as the forces of Good, represented by Harris and Mortensen, square off against the forces of Evil, embodied by Irons and his cohorts.There's not much that is truly new here, except perhaps for a refreshingly novel moral slackness in the lead female character. Yet, while the characterizations are rich, the relationships complex and the performances authentic, the movie itself suffers from a bad case of inertia, loping along at an enervating pace when it should be racing ahead at a full-on gallop.There's substance of a sort to "Appaloosa;" it's just a question of whether you'll be able to stay awake long enough to fully absorb and appreciate it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fascinating Western about two lifelong friends?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are two tough partners in justice Virgil Cole (Ed Harris) and Everett Hitch (Viggo Mortensen) that have been riding together for more than one decade and they understand each other just fine? So they're not initially supposed to talk about their easy, warm, intuitive solidarity? We intuitively catch there's something between them, that special bond, that profound respect, and obviously that sense of esteem, of attention and sympathy and most of all each other's needs?Ed is particularly fine? It may not be a romantic conception, but he gives his role great vitality? He's melancholy, laconic and assured as the cool, nerveless professional hired gun who becomes the town's peace keeper... His justice is rapid and simple? Follow his law or get locked up; if you deny, you're going to be shot? He's also very faithful, and you see this in his friendship with Everett Hitch? Virgil trusts Everett completely because Everett is very sincere and truthful with him?With his formidable shotgun, Everett is a kind of Virgil's straight man, his worshiping right hand and conscience? Mortensen is a sharpshooter? He's never seen on foot, in any scene, without his huge weapon? His heavy rifle has become almost another character in the film? It doesn't matter where, either in his hands or right next to him? And that's in the bar, in the restaurant, in the office, and even in the bedroom? Renee Zellweger plays the role of Allison French, a mysterious woman who seduces everyone?After Cole and Hitch meet her in a restaurant, they knew that she is a refined widow, that she arrives to the brutal New Mexico town with one dollar in her purse, that she plays piano and likes to be called Allie? Cole takes a liking to her, and makes a very tough decision to stick with her? Zellweger plays the malicious new-gal with a great sense of sweetness and gaiety? She brings liveliness and refinement to her role?Another strong character in "Appaloosa" is the miscreant cold-hearted rancher Randall Bragg? The film starts with the killing of the town's last Marshall and his deputies at the hands of the nefarious Bragg played by Jeremy Irons? Bragg is a wealthy man whose ranch henchmen run menacingly and aggressively over the town?"Appaloosa" is a Western of real depth and sophistication? Every punch seen in the film is like a word of dialog moving the story forward, creating tension and drama?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I Expected A Better Movie.....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As Westerns go this is probably more typical than I would have liked. Though a very fine actress, I believe that Zellweger was the not right person for this particular part. She is great at loves stories but there was no love in this move between the characters ? just a relationship of convenience. The movie would have actually been much better if the woman/marshal relationship had been totally cut out but then it wouldn't have been true to the book. Unfortunately, it just wasn't handled well and most viewers will see the weakness. You really felt no connection between the good guys and the bad guys ? you really didn't care if any of them live or die. In fact the relationship between the characters is so tenuous that it sometimes seems there is none ? just actors reading their lines. The problem was not the actors but the script and the connection to the audience. I knew it was somewhat of a dud when I started falling asleep toward the end and missed part of the movie. Considering I started watching it at 12:30 P.M. this says more about the movie than words can tell. I am reminded that in the movie Aliens, James Cameron did not shoot the scenes where the Marines are coming out of hibernation until the very end of the movie because he wanted them to have real camaraderie ? which you feel between the characters. That is what this movie is missing from beginning to end ? Camaraderie. It is just seems like scripts being read, which is too bad because you want a villain to hate and the good guy to love. You neither hate nor love in this movie -- you just kind of drift off?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>authentic and poignant western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Appaloosa is a classic western and a sophisticated drama.Appaloosa unfolds at the right pace for a drama. The scale is intimate, close, and minimalist, more like Tender Mercies or Hud than The Magnificent Seven. There is some action and a couple of very impressive gunfights, but it is not an action movie. That's what I like about it. It is willfully and deliberately not an action movie. Why does everyone assume that a western must necessarily be an action movie? How refreshing to finally see a western that's a character-driven drama, and it is through character that it generates tension, suspense, and interest.Appaloosa is authentic because it's about stoic people living in harsh frontier conditions. These characters are maturely written, and they behave in a credible 19th century way. The acting is deeply felt all around. Even Jeremy Irons, who plays the corrupt rancher with political connections, is accurate casting. The American west was full of English and Irish immigrants who participated in range wars, county feuds, and town-site disputes. I don't think I've ever seen a female lead quite like Mrs. Allie French in a western before. She's a complete original for a western, and reminds me of the real women I read about in historical and biographical texts about the American west. I don't mind that she is played by Renee Zellwegger. Ed Harris and Viggio Mortenson deliver understated performances as town-tamers who are loosely inspired by historical lawmen. These two actors play off of each other's nuances with alertness and self-deprecating humor. The audiences can tell their friendship has been tested and we can believe they are only still alive because of their mutual trust. How their conflict plays out over Mrs. French works against our expectations of the genre. They both love Mrs. French despite her weaknesses. They will not hesitate to sacrifice for her, but nothing can break the respect these two men have for each other. There is a refreshing gentlemanly quality to this bittersweet triangle that I haven't seen since the early westerns of Zane Grey.Appaloosa is authentic not only because of its characters, but because it's filmed in New Mexico locations that are correct to the time and place in which the story is set. The scenery includes the old adobe pueblo of Rancho de los Golindrinas, which western buffs may recognize from The Man From Laramie (1955), the antique narrow-gauge railway near Chama, and the pristine landscapes of Glen Hughes's Bonanza Creek Ranch below Santa Fe with its frontier-era town set, one of the oldest operating cowboy ranches in New Mexico. It's dusty and appropriately weathered, and the cinematography by Dean Seamler is a pleasure. The filmmakers work hard to get props, firearms, and set dressings correct to the period. The actors work hard to capture the vernacular of western speech, and they wear the right costumes and haircuts. They even stop to carefully reload their weapons, instead of firing a ridiculous and endless number of bullets like in spaghetti westerns.The "R" rating is so unfair. There is one four-letter word and a four-second shot of two bare behinds in the distance, but that hardly merits an R rating. There's no gore and less violence than in most PG films. This is the kind of mature drama and appreciative Americana that adolescents need to see at the movies.Ed Harris has made a kind of acoustic folk ballad of a western. There is no cgi, no cartoonish action. Nothing is faked, everything is real, including the weather. The train rattles and the wind blows inside because it really rattles and the wind really blows inside the cars. A lot of attention is paid to authentic sounds and visual textures of the period. Don't miss Appaloosa when it comes your way. Go to see it expecting an authentic western drama that credits you with intelligence and appeals to your intelligence. I hope audiences know how to appreciate what writer-director Ed Harris has accomplished here.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Two Smoking Barrels And A Promiscuous Dame</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Of recent times, the only Western movie that I liked was Kevin Costner's 'Open Range'. Now there's another one, 'Appaloosa' which is produced, written, directed and performed in by Ed Harris. The film pretty much has the ingredients of the 60s and 70s Western hits. It starts off a little slow but gradually picks up. 'Appaloosa' is more a comedy than an action but action movie lovers need not worry because there is plenty of that too, all 60's Western style. The dialogue is great and some of them are laugh out loud. The desert and mountainous visuals are stunning to look at. The two law-enforcement heroes, are brilliantly played by Ed Harris and Viggo Mortensen. Harris is totally hilarious yet we sympathize for him when he falls hopelessly in love with the promiscuous never-to-be-faithful Ali. Mortensen is more restrained, reminding one of Clint Eastwood at times, but equally effective. I initially thought Renee Zellweger was cast as the typical love interest but man was I wrong. Here she is cast against type and the actress is simply great as she deceptively uses those innocent sweet girl looks to mask her frivolity and promiscuity. Likewise, Jeremy Irons is an excellent villain with a touch of comedy. Lovers of Western cinema wold enjoy this. This is most of all Harris's achievement as he scores high on all counts. Hope he makes more movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointingly ordinary western that marks Harris's directorial debut</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning In the lawless town of Appaloosa in the mid west, reckless peace keeper Virgil Cole (Ed Harris) comes riding in. The town is in the grip of a villain named Randall Bragg (Jeremy Irons) who forces his own sense of law on the people. Cole's no nonsense, unorthodox approach winds some people up, but he gets results and gets to enjoy a romance with new lady in town Allison French (Renee Zellweger) who comes to cause tension with him and best friend Everett (Viggo Mortensen) before he embarks on one last mission to take Bragg down for good.The western is an old, forgotten genre that's been creeping out of the woodwork again with films like The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada, 3:10 to Yuma and now this directorial debut from Ed Harris, who also takes on lead role duties.This is his first film to make an impression as a director. It has the feel of being quite a personal film to him (perhaps most notable with the bizarre end credits sequence) and maybe he is quite fond of westerns himself. You have to wonder, then, why he's delivered such a bland and unremarkable piece that simply goes where you expect it to and offers little in the way of surprises. Appaloosa simply offers what any Clint Eastwood western from the '50s or '60s would have given you, without any particular flair or style. With material so weak, none of the cast deliver any exceptionally brilliant performances, with Harris, Mortensen, Zellweger and even a surprise appearance by Timothy Spall all just going through the motions. Irons re-appears out of nowhere as the baddie, but his over dramatizing just makes things even weaker.There are one or two plus points. The cinematography and sweeping western landscapes are at times breath taking and beautiful and it's made with just enough affection and panache to mark it out. But this is still a disappointingly ordinary directorial effort from Harris. And you only get one chance to make a first impression. **</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Low-Key Western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the old West, two men ride into a small town to establish some law and order. This is a leisurely paced Western and it's quite enjoyable for the most part, but sort of runs out of steam about two-thirds of the way through. It is mostly a character study, with much time spent on low-key exchanges between Harris and Mortensen as the two lawmen, with some of the scenes reminiscent of "My Darling Clementine." Not that it's anywhere close to being as good as that classic. Zellweger seems like a curious choice to play a woman who arrives in town and strikes up a romance with Harris. She just looks out of place in a Western. It's not a bad second effort for Harris behind the camera.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie has pretty much the same feeling, plot line and characters, as some older western. Yet, it also has this modern look and storytelling. Most of the characters are likable, and the actors do a great work. The plot and characters are build up well. For such a long movie, there are enough things going all the time. Gun fights look and sound good, the props are nice and music works just fine. The story is credible and the progress is exciting.Only down side of this movie is the Allison character (by Renée Zellweger). She could have been built up a bit slower and with care. Now she just pops up, but on the other hand, that brings a bit of a mystery to her and doesn't really matter.Totally worth of watching, if you like the 60's westerns.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Intelligent and compelling tale about two friends hired by little townspeople to protect them</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are always the men who live breathe violence and the women who hold their breath. Two famous ¨town tamer¨ named Virgil Cole (Ed Harris) and Everett Stitch(Viggo Mortensen)come hired by the citizens (Timothy Spall, James Gammon) to rid a rancher ( Jeremy Irons), and his hoodlums (Lance Henriksen, among others). The villagers are suffering under the rule of the cruel Baronland. Virgil and Everett as lawmen are appointed deputies to bring peace and put some cartels warning that wearing of guns or other weapons in the little town is banned. Virgil meets a youngster widow named Allison (Renee Zellweger) and the problems emerge and complicate. But the town council afraid the raw methods carried out by the duo. Then the kingpin landowner appears and threats them.This is a tremendously exciting story of a sheriffs-for-hire who had only one more killing to go. It begins as a slow-moving Western but follows to surprise us with interesting characters and solid plot. The tale is almost grim , a pacifiers come to a town just in time to make sure its citizenry but later the events get worse .Good modern Western with exciting battle of wits between obstinate marshals and an astute killer who begins to psych him out. Stylish, fast paced , nice performance, solid, meticulous and violent look with several shootouts .The highlights of the movie are the kidnapping and the climatic showdown at the ending. Phenomenal and great roles for Ed Harris and Viggo Mortensen as veteran drifters and embittered gunfighters, they're the whole show. Vivid and lively musical score fitting rightly to action Western by Jeff Beal. Atmospheric and colorful cinematography by Dean Semler. The motion picture is stunningly directed by Ed Harris who is preparing its following, he also directed another good film titled ¨Pollock¨ . Watchable results for this outlandish Western.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not too bad overall, great ending</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Things I Liked About It: 1. The theme song is awesome. 2. The characters are fascinating. 3. The ending was great. Probably the most satisfying ending of a western I have seen. Things I Didn't Like About It: 1. The pace is sometimes slow, or else what was going on wasn't interesting enough - one or the other. 2. F Bombs. There are a few (which is probably the main reason for the R rating) and the F-Bomb was not in common use during that era. I don't know why Hollywood insists on using it, when it wasn't part of the vocabulary of the era. It's not authentic.Overall summary I would say that although Appaloosa started out slow, and was at certain places dull, the way it ended was so satisfying it was worth it. If they made a sequel of this movie that somehow focused on Everitt's character I would definitely watch it. He was the most the most interesting character of all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is not your typical western. The characters are more developed and do a lot of talking versus gun slinging. But there are some gun fights along the way. Town officials of Appaloosa hire two gunmen, Cole and Hitch, to be the new sheriff in town. They want them to get rid of Randall Bragg, an outlaw that killed the previous sheriff. Widow, Allison French, shows up and you think there is going to be a love triangle, but there really wasn't much of one. She takes a liking to Cole, but also gives Hitch mixed singles. The two are able to arrest Bragg for murder and the latter part of the film is Bragg escaping and Cole finding him and trying to bring him in. In the end Bragg seems reformed. The side plot involving Allison is she seems to go after any man with power. So, before leaving town, Hitch does Cole one last favor since Cole says he won't leave Allison even if she fools around.Ed Harris and Viggo Mortenson gave the best acting performance. You'd think they did come from the old west. The film does move slowly at times.FINAL VERDICT: If you like westerns, then I would say you will find this movie worth your time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stylish western with a great script</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many in Hollywood believe the western is dead, but every couple of years or so along comes a new western to breathe life into the old standbys: OPEN RANGE, 3:10 TO YUMA, and of course TV's DEADWOOD. APPALOOSA is such a film that follows a typical storyline as a couple of lawmen battle an outlaw gang in a small town.It's the kind of story that's been done hundreds, if not thousands, of times. But the strength of APPALOOSA lies not in the plotting but the script, which is alive with warmth and humour. Harris plays a borderline maniac with a quick trigger finger, Mortensen his more reasoned companion who favours his brain over his heart. Both actors exude quiet menace and are quite brilliant in the parts.Unfortunately there's a problem further down the cast list: namely Renee Zellweger as a love interest. I don't understand where Zellweger's popularity comes from, because I think she's awful, and nowhere more so than here. Still, the casting director makes up for it with a couple of meaty roles for veteran actors Jeremy Irons and Lance Henriksen.Harris wrote the screenplay, produced and directed the film. His love shows in the finely-crafted screenplay and the expert direction, which invests the occasional action scene with flair and life. My only complaint with the story is the ending, which is a little muted. But that's APPALOOSA all over: it's a film about people living life in the West rather than a shoot-em-up flick. I liked it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A commendable revival of old westerns</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie appears to be among the recent parade in revival of good old-time westerns including from "Open range" (2003) to "3:10 to Yuma" (2007). "The assassination of Jesse James etc" (2007) however, despite the packaging, is not really a western, at least not so much as an art-house character study.Appaloosa (the name of a street in a western town where the main action takes place) is in every sense a western in its hay days of the 50s and 60s. And yet, there is a subtle touch of contemporary feel in it. Quite naturally, Ed Harris directs himself into the protagonist, a gun man hired to clean up a small town, with three key characters orbiting around him. Harris himself give the audience a nostalgic combination of Gary Cooper's sternness and John Wayne's easy sense of humour.Of the other three, Viggo Mortensen as the rifle wielding side kick (very much as Steve MacQueen does in "The magnificent seven" with Yul Breynner), has more than meets the eyes. Taciturn behind his moustache and beard, Mortensen uses his eyes to exert the authority Aragon. While well content to step aside from the spotlight, this character is the keeper of the protagonist, just as deadly (maybe even more so) as the other, but with firm control when the other's emotion becomes explosive. His self-sacrificing loyalty is impeccable.Jeremy Iron as the traditional bad guy delivers his role with ease, as rightly expected of him.Renee Zellweger as the widow (as a rather merry one, shall we say) coming to town is moist interesting, and probably unlike any others you have seen in a western. Neither damsel-in-distress nor femme fatale, not even the mix of the two, she is actually a bit out-of-place yet refreshing. Upon being told that she is widow coming to town by herself, Harris's character loses no time in asking "are you a whore?", which brings about a smiling indignation from her, and igniting the chemistry for mutual attraction.Die hard western fans who miss the 50s and the 60s would likely enjoy this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Right Up My Street!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have always adored Westerns. My love affair with the genre started when I was about five years old and began watching Bonanza. A dining room chair became my horse as I rode the dusty plains of our house in a dull London suburb, the chair festooned with string reins and stirrups, Little Joe stirring my prepubescent heart. Bonanza was followed by Wagon Train, reruns of Gunsmoke, then The Virginian, Lancer and The High Chaparral. At the theatre Clint Eastwood reigned supreme, I read Zane Grey and I absorbed High Noon, The Searchers, Liberty Vallance and just about anything else on TV involving a horse and a man in a Stetson. Sad really?? Then I took up horse riding for real and knew, without a shadow of a doubt, that I'd been born the wrong sex and a hundred years too late. I should have been a cowboy.So I went to see Appaloosa ready to enjoy it. To be honest, this film would have had to be a complete dog not to get at least 8/10 from me. And Appaloosa is a Western of the best kind; peopled by taciturn men, women with a past, unshaven outlaws with big guns, and simple but good hearted townsfolk. Ed Harris plays Virgil Cole a gun for hire lawman, while Viggo Mortensen is his sidekick Everett Hitch, a man of few words but a very, very big gun. Hired to clean up a small town in New Mexico (the Appaloosa of the title), Cole and Hitch take on Randall Bragg (a wonderfully grizzly Jeremy Irons) the local bad guy. Cole and Hitch are best buddies who cover each other's backs, but the appearance of Mrs French (Renee Zellweger) in town threatens to distract them from the job in hand. After arresting Bragg for murder and seeing him tried and found guilty, Cole and Hitch set off to take him to jail, but when Mrs French is kidnapped they are forced to release Bragg in exchange, and then to track the outlaws and the captive woman across country. Mrs French's morality is called into question ? she will give her loyalty and her sexual favours to whoever she perceives as being Top Dog, but Cole weighs up the pros and cons and decides he loves her anyway. After all, she bathes every night. Appaloosa tries to show the importance of the friendship between the men policing this tough frontier land, and the survival skills of the women who could never compete with the men physically but must try and make their own lives bearable. The story is fairly simple and, as in all the best Westerns, it's a morality play where good and evil exist in plain view, where life is lived in black and white. Bragg is a murderer and a bully who has the town in his thrall, Cole and Hitch kill too, but where Bragg kills the defenseless and those who get in his way, Hitch and Cole kill in the name of the law, and prefer to arrest the baddie and send him for trial, trying to impose order on an untamed land. But the introduction of the alluring Mrs French with her wavering loyalties introduces more complex shades of grey to the scene. It tests the men's loyalty to each other, and suggests that we do whatever we have to do to survive in a world with no safety nets. I liked Zellweger in the part; she is attractive and sexy but doesn't play it as ridiculously beautiful or stick thin. She is attractive enough to turn heads in this small town, but doesn't look unrealistic. We know that any woman of truly stunning beauty would not be in this situation; she'd have been snapped up long before. Zellweger brings an air of brave and slightly knowing vulnerability to the role, rather than girly helplessness. She's a survivor, not a princess waiting to be swept off her feet for happy ever afters. In the end, Hitch does what a man must do to protect his friend, and, as in all the best Westerns, rides off alone into the sunset.Directed by Harris, Appaloosa's beautifully shot, the landscape of New Mexico is stark and harsh. The dialog is very well written and often suffused with dry humour, all the performances are well nuanced, and I got the feeling it was a labour of love for all concerned. I thoroughly enjoyed it, (might even buy the DVD, a rarity for me!) and Ed Harris seems to be shaping up as an interesting director. My only slight comment might be that Viggo Mortensen plays yet another enigmatic man of few words. How often have we seen him do this now? Appaloosa, Eastern Promises, Hidalgo, LOTR, even his first role in Witness, all men full of meaningful silences and deep thoughts. I'm not saying I don't like these roles, I do. But I'd love to see him do something totally off the wall.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly poor performance for such a good cast</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to admit I had relatively high expectations of Appaloosa purely because of the cast. Ed Harris is consistently Oscar worthy in my opinion, Viggo Mortensen is usually solid and brooding, Renee Zellweger is among the stronger of Hollywood's leading ladies, and Jeremy Irons - though sometimes hit and miss - more often hits. And knowing that Timothy Spall and Lance Henriksen would be putting in appearances was just icing on the cake.I suspected that it might not be as much of a powerhouse movie as Unforgiven or 3:10 to Yuma. I suspected that it might be a back-to-basics plot with little character development. What I really didn't expect, though, was terrible stilted lines of dialogue phoned-in by a cast that looked like they didn't really want to be there, but that's what I got and it sent me reeling! The script is pretty poor but passable. The directing, likewise is average and forgettable. The film could have (and should have) been elevated above the masses by the talent of its cast but that just wasn't the case... in fact, you could have populated this movie with B-actors from the sci-fi channel and you'd have had just about the same quality level. Very surprising indeed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A really good evocation of an old trope</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went to this movie to see how they managed to do it, having read the book by Robert B. Parker first. Usually I have trouble seeing a movie after reading the book it is based on, but this time they got it just right.Harris and Mortenson play the knight errant and squire very effectively. That's what the movie, and most Westerns are about (see Shane, The Searchers and many others). The knight (Virgil) is flawed, both by an inferior education and by a destructive romanticism which cripples him at a key point in the story. The squire (Everett) is played by Mortenson in a mostly silent supporting capacity, and he succeeds in showing the code in its full light. Because this story is about the code men live by (a recurring theme for Parker, the novel's author) and what happens when the code is threatened.Renee Zellweger does a really good job as an amoral character, but she is humanized because at some point we realize that she is Everywoman living in a man's construct, doing what she has to do to survive. She is not condemned by either main male character, indeed they both understand her and pity her. This is the switch on the usual perception of women in Westerns. The other, more minor character, the whore Everett takes up with, is a subtle commentary on this whole problem of who women are to men and to themselves. She sees the whole thing the most clearly, and understands both the men and the woman. There is almost no bitchiness, and no interaction between the two women.The inevitable ending of a story like this is, well, inevitable, but it still manages to shake the viewer. Altogether a quietly powerful film, which deserves more notice than it will probably get.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sometimes you can see the notes of the writer in a film. Its as if he or she sat down with the intent of accomplishing certain things and wrote a story. But instead of the story, we still see the unerased list of goals. When the writer isn't a real writer, but an actor, things are more likely to be transparent.Here's what Ed Harris wanted: some reference to good old western values, so he could inherit a whole world without having to write it. Then to induce some tension among four characters in the characters, not in the story. The four characters are Harris, his sidekick, his wandering girlfriend and the town's bad guy.The western values? A haunted man. A code, a serious code of honor and allegiance, forged in the "Ford defines what it means to be American" tradition. Admiration behind the allegiance, driven by the power of the code centered in personality. Harris of course wrote this so he could be the center of that cosmos of personality.Its the devices that stand out unpolished. What Harris intended was that we ourselves would find each of these characters attractive in some way and repellent in others, thus giving us enough interest to seduce an audience. To accomplish this, he's moving the observer, and what the observer thinks.Our designated observer is the sidekick. We discover this in the first few seconds with a voice over narration, which reappears at the end as we close the book. It is through his eyes that we discover everything. He is not only in every scene that matters (except the one in the very beginning) but the camera and often the action emphasize that he is the watcher, a watcher that sometimes intercedes with his shotgun. He is the writer. Harris is the viewed. There's a particularly clumsy device used to emphasize this: Harris' character often wishes to use a "big" word and stumbles, having to ask the writer. The three in Harris' orbit:The town's bad guy, who pretty much is unaltered from the template, except that we know he is the most educated guy on screen. The movie builds until we as the viewer cheer the writer on to intercede, vigilante-wise.The side-kick, writer and observer who escapes the pull of Harris' character at the end by embodying the code of honor more than he could. Its that honor that drives him. Watch how he watches and how key scenes are set up for him to watch.The one deviation from the template is the girl, here played by an annoying Zellweger. Other than "Chicago" I just cannot understand why she is considered valuable. Anyway, the character is a sort of surrogate watcher, a mooneyed admirer. This is what I call folding, this structure where the watcher that is close to us (the sidekick) watches another watcher who is deeper in the story. (He himself has a watcher as well, a very effective whore.)Now, the whole dynamic of the story concerns who she attaches herself to. She goes unerringly with the man who has the strongest narrative pull, which is to say the person who pulls the world and how the world works into themselves. With a but more work, or a real writer on the team, this could have been effective.The score works.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ultra-realistic Western with Ed Harris, Viggo Mortensen and Renée Zellweger</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 2008's "Appaloosa" two itinerate lawmen -- Virgil Cole (Ed Harris) and Everett Hitch (Viggo Mortensen) -- are hired to protect the New Mexican town of Appaloosa from Randall Bragg (Jeremy Irons), a newly-arrived rancher with money and a gang of thugs who arrogantly murdered three local lawmen. Virgil and Everett are seasoned professionals and have no fear. Meanwhile, a cute and seemingly refined widow comes to town, Allison French (Renée Zellweger), and Virgil falls hard for her, but is she worthy of his (or any man's) devotion? Harris and Mortensen were born to play Westerners and Zellweger is exquisite as the insecure babe who always needs to be desired. Moreover, Irons makes for a first-rate Western villain."Appaloosa" is a really good modern Western featuring the typical Western staples, but with great actors, mature themes and a totally realistic tone. When the action comes it's swift and brutal, but there's a lot of slow (albeit interesting) drama, so stay away if you have ADHD and require an explosion every five minutes to maintain your limited attention span.The film runs 115 minutes and was shot in New Mexico.GRADE: A-</fullReview>

My only criticism was the roles played by Mortensen and Irons.Both very fine actors, but this was a buffer for both of them. Viggo Mortensen did not to me come across as a tough guy lawman. I thought Lance Henrickson would have been more suited. When i saw on the credits that Jeremy Irons was to play the bad guy, i thought again another English Actor playing the villain. A bit like Michael Gambon in Open Range, which was a better movie and played by veteran Western Actors, Robert Duvall and Kevin Costner.The problem with Irons was he was playing an American character, but sometimes you could hear his English accent coming through. Ed Harris was flawless. I was impressed by the fact this was his first Western. Not a bad movie, but i was disappointed with Viggo Mortensen and Jeremy Irons, especially as i am a fan of their works. For something to watch for a Saturday evening it is fine, but don't expect a classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Appaloosa is certainly not a unwatchable film, but isn't a enjoyable one either. Is nearly pointless to watch this movie, to be honest. It don't brings nothing new or at least good or entertaining to the table at all. So lets start to talk about it:, three reasons of 'Why' Appaloosa don't works: 1. the characters actions are way too slow paced. There is almost no conflicts between the characters, and when you think that something "exciting" is finally going to happen, it just...don't happen. 2.The 'villain', the only element of conflict in the entire story, has absolutely no power and he almost don't shows up until the first hour of the movie. Way too much time. 3. One of the most annoying things in this film are certainly the pointless dialogues between the main characters. I love movies which are driven by good dialogues, but certainly Appaloosa is not one of them. Literally a dread western.</fullReview>

His restraint at the helm becomes almost a point of pride as everything and every line is delivered with such a soft veneer as to resemble an old photo album from the late 1800's.This is an approach. It could be called a style. But does it work as a film. or entertainment, or an unpretentious study of characters and time. Well, somewhat. It does manage to give a realistic portrayal of the new/old West, and everything looks and sounds authentic, but one seems to expect some release of a repressed energy.Things do erupt here but so quickly and almost uneventfully. After a skirmish or a confrontation things are put back together and continue as if hardly anything has occurred. The consequences are barely consequential here. This is the movie's tone and it is deliberate. But such control and discipline can be uninspiring and not as interesting as it actually is. What would elevate this experiment would be just a dash of Dime Novel swagger.</fullReview>

I actually quite liked this aspect of the plot; it gave the characters some realism, something that many westerns lack. All the performances from the main cast were excellent; in particular Ed Harris and Viggo Mortensen, who takes the prize for the best beard and moustache combo I've seen in many a year! I wasn't too sure about Jeremy Irons as the bad guy at first, but he soon grew on me; as did Renée Zellweger as the femme fatale. Performances aside, I must warn you that at times it can be painfully slow, but I didn't particularly mind that. Over all, it did have a few quirks, but, for me, it worked. I would probably watch it again sometime and I have a feeling I'd enjoy it more second time around.SteelMonster's verdict: RECOMMENDEDMy score: 6.8/10.You can find an expanded version of this review on my blog: Thoughts of a SteelMonster.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Appaloosa is a great classic western tale of friendship, love, trust and politics in the Wild West. There is a good story in Appaloosa and it doesn't just involve fast lines and faster guns like most westerns. In fact, there is little gun-slinging at all and the few fight sequences are short and more realistic than you would find in your typical Hollywood film of late which may turn off some viewers. Fortunetly, this film is more about the characters and the journey that they take in knowing each other and themselves and who is trust worthy and who is not. The cast is great for the most part especially Viggo Mortensen as the silent but deadly comrade to Ed Harris's character. The interaction between these two alone makes the film worth watching. My only real disappointment with this film was the casting of Renee Zelweger as she is a terrible actress and bought nothing to this film except annoyance. I didn't care in the slightest for her character and there were many times I was hoping someone would shoot her and be done with all the trouble! Besides that factor, Appaloosa is a solid western and an enjoyable film that should be watched for the story - not the gun-slinging.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Law? Justice? this movie is all about Good vs. Evil</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is in many ways a classic western, but with several twists. Near the very beginning of the movie, the town's marshal goes out to confront rich rancher Randall Bragg (Jeremy Irons), but Bragg kills the marshal and his deputies without warning. The town's leaders summon famous gunmen Virgil Cole (Harris) and Everett Hitch (Mortensen) to become the new marshal and deputy. Cole sets down his rules, which are strict, and roughs up two of Bragg's men in the saloon to serve notice to Bragg. The movie rolls on from there, with a major role being played by Renee Zellweger. Virgil Cole falls for her completely, even though she is very untrustworthy. Cole and Hitch pull a sneak attack on Bragg's property and drag him off to town, where a trial ensues and the judge finds Bragg guilty of murder. But before Bragg can be transported to another town for execution, he is freed. Because Bragg knows the U.S. President, he is pardoned. But Cole and Hitch do not forget and do not forgive. Bragg buys the local hotel and subverts the mayor and town's leaders. Warns Hitch that if "you boys don't fall in line, you may be out of a job." Bragg is protected by the law. Has justice been served? Hitch can see the handwriting on the wall and acts before his close friend Cole is fired as marshal. In the end, the "good guys" win. Good (OK, "good" is a relative term here) defeats evil.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Engaging Old-Fashioned Western.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's old fashioned because there's never any real doubt about who's good and who's bad in this nicely filmed and subtly comedic Western. Local big shot Jeremy Irons is bad. He shot a deputy sheriff in Apaloosa. The honest sheriff, Ed Harris, and his remaining deputy, Vigo Mortenson, capture Irons, see him convicted and sentenced to hang, but then are forced to part with their prisoner in exchange for the life of Harris's girl friend, Renee Zellweger. A climactic shoot out resolves most of the issues.Zellweger, it must be admitted, is not exactly good or evil but, despite her youth, rather a sort of laundered-out gray. Harris's girl friend? Yes, in a way, but she's inconstant. When she's kidnapped by Irons' henchmen, Harris and Mortenson track the party down and through a telescope see her dallying naked in the river with one of the miscreants. Earlier, on what seems like impulse, she throws herself into Mortenson's arms, glues her mouth to his, and otherwise appears to be -- well, in a state that, in mares, horse breeders call "clipping." I threw that last datum in there for your benefit but, as we all know, there is no such thing as a free lunch, so that will be ten cents.What impresses most about the movie is the wardrobe and make up. I can believe that people actually looked like this in the Old West, whereas I couldn't believe that they looked like John Wayne in one of those 1930s blockbusters from Republic, the ones in which he wears a 50-gallon white Stetson. I can believe, too, that shoot outs looked more like the ones we see here than most of the others that have shown up on screen. There's no nonsense about the fastest draw. No one's gun hand has the celerity and splendor of Catatumbo lightning. Men approach each other with guns drawn and begin shooting without count downs. The reason I believe this to be more accurate is that the shoot out was an historical descendant of the code duelo that prevailed in Europe for centuries. The South was settled largely by cavaliers, men of fierce honor, and westward expansion brought them and their values to the Southwest. The duels at sunrise that had been fought with swords in the 18th century decayed and became less formalized bouts with pistols on the plains of Texas. Did you know that Robert E. Lee had to post his officers with individual care because there were so many challenges pending in the Confederate Army?Sorry. It's no use. This essay is clumsy and disjointed, I know, but it's because I'm being attacked by this new kitten, a demon from hell. I was going to give her some suitably Mexican name like Marisel but I think Entropy may be more apt. Can't wait for her to acquire a bit more bulk. I'm told they can be turned into a savory General Tso's chicken.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well acted western character study</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First, I don't think Renee Zellweger is that great, so any actress could have filled her role with no loss.Ed Harris and Viggo Mortensen were first rate as the "town tamers". Their interplay is at the heart of the movie. Both performances are subtle and understated. Jeremy Irons makes a major contribution.The film definitely contains violence and gunfire, but not as in the "action film" genre of blazing machine guns and exploding cars(or in this case buckboard wagons.) There is no flash, no nonsense, no gimmicks.This has got to be one of the best westerns made in the last couple of decades.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Atypical western is all about the characters and the nature of friendship</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on a novel by Robert Parker (Spencer,Jesse Stone, Sunny Randle, Philip Marlowe) this is a buddy western that plays by its own terms.The story concerns Virgil Cole (Ed Harris) and his partner Everett Hitch (Viggo Mortensen), two law men for hire. They summoned to the town of Appaloosa to bring order to the town which has been terrorized by the men working for Randall Bragg (Jeremy Irons). Bragg killed the marshal and his deputies when they went to arrest one of his men. A stand off between the new law and Bragg quickly develops. Adding to the mix is appearance of Allison French (Renée Zellweger) an organist and piano player looking for work, and who has an eye for Virgil.An atypical western that goes in its own direction.First and foremost this is a story about the characters. This is about Virgil and Everett and how they play off each other. We see them in good times and bad and we come to understand the relationship between the two men, even in the face of the inclusion of a woman. Its is akin to the relation ship between Parker's Spencer and Hawk, but without the words. In actuality Virgil, the complete honest, up front though not too bright (book learning wise) leader and Everett, the smarter, more feeling aide decamp with the eight gauge, are even tighter than Hawk and Spencer since no explanations are necessary and even few words. I would argue that the relationship is a male buddy sort of thing but I know that I've had this sort of complete understanding with a couple of women in my life as well. These are quite simply two of the greatest characters ever to appear on screen and for their mere introduction puts this film on my best of the year.The rest of the film could be classified as lumpy. Its a solidly good film but it meanders and wanders in unexpected ways that often grate against our expectations. This isn't a bad thing since it allows for a third act that is almost completely unexpected (and which makes the film better than just good). As I said the film is about the relationship so the plot, the lets get the bad guy, more often then not really isn't front and center, so we wonder why its being pushed to the side. Its not a bad thing but its not until you get to the end that you see what was really going on in the filmmakers minds.When you see the film you have to put your expectations away and let the film be and you will be rewarded.I have to point out how good Ed Harris is at composing shots and using the camera to say so much without words. One need only see the shot of Everett sitting in a chair towards the end of the film to have volumes of information transfered to you. Its fantastic.And see this on a big screen its beautifully composed for a 2.35 to 1 ratio.I want to see the sequel which Ed Harris said will follow if enough people see this. (That is to be based on the next two novels) I'm guessing that will be a better film because all of the ground work was laid out here.Its a very good film. And despite it not being a great film (I'd give it between 7 and 8 out of 10) I'm going to put it on my best of the year since while it has greatness in it, it also is a solid little film that doesn't want to be anything other than what it is. Its the little film that could and for me thats enough. Its a real movie, not a film, not an entertainment, nothing but a movie and the sort of thing no one seems to make any more.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You can hardly go wrong with a show with Ed Harris and Viggo Mortensen on one side and Jeremy Irons on the other. Harris and Mortenson have the law on their side, but they are really just hired guns tasked with cleaning up towns. In this case, they are cleaning up Appaloosa and opposing Irons.Ad to the mix a new gal in town in the person of Renee Zellweger, a piano player. The Sheriff (Harris) is immediately smitten.Now, this is just about as much plot as you need. It's a western, so you know there are going to be gunfights. But there is time for love and betrayal mixed in.Besides those mentioned, we also have Timothy Spall (Wormtail in the Harry Potter films, and Beadle in Sweeeney Todd) and Ariadna Gil (Pan's Labyrinth), two people I always enjoy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>great movie, wrong actress</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie was excellent the first time, but when I went to watch it on TV,I did not want to see Renee Z. again. She was awful in this movie, too sickeningly much, too much lip, too over exaggerated, over acting. The settings and landscapes were as good as Open Range, but her acting of this character wrecked the whole movie. There were so many other actresses that would have been much better, Kate Hudson or Drew Barrymore would have been great. The story is good and sad,and the movie was well produced,but casting so wrong in Renee Z.'s part. Ed and Victor were excellent and the movie moved along just fine. Not on my top list.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great film? Perhaps not. A satisfying Western? Definitely</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Every so often you see a movie which doesn't surprise you, doesn't amaze you, but a movie that you still appreciate more than most. "Appaloosa" is one of those. In concept and even in execution this is nothing new, certainly not for those who have seen many Westerns. The difference between this and most is that conventions are conventions and not clichés, and there is real depth with the characters. The writing for the characters immediately sets this apart from your standard action Western, although I didn't think it was great, I appreciated that there were no caricatures involved here, except perhaps for the villain. Also, I thought Renee Zellweger was just fine, and didn't even come close to ruining the film as others have suggested.The Western is, of course, a relatively dead genre, but there are still enough of them coming out to be more or less satisfying. In addition, due to the low number of major Westerns, the average quality of the films is higher. Out of all the Westerns released this decade, and I've seen most of the major ones I think with the exception of "Seraphim Falls", the one I liked the least was "3:10 to Yuma", a film I still enjoyed relatively insubstantial as it was. On the other hand I have enjoyed many of the recent Westerns a great deal: "Broken Trail", "The Proposition", "The Claim", and especially "The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford" and "Open Range". For that reason alone I can't even begin to suggest that "Appaloosa" is one of the best Westerns in recent years. It's not. It is, however, a confident, well-written, and well-directed genre film which will certainly satisfy Western enthusiasts.The film boasts an excellent cast, but there are no standout performances. Except for Ed Harris. I thought he was, pardon the crudeness, a classic Western badass. One of the most charming things about "Appaloosa" is its clear love of the conventions of the traditional Western as well as its application of revisionist moments within the film. Not to deconstruct the genre, but to enhance the quality of this film, these characters, and this story. I don't think "Appaloosa" is necessarily a film I will be recommending wholeheartedly as one of the best of its genre, as I certainly will with the admittedly not action-oriented "Jesse James" from 2007 or Kevin Costner's "Open Range" from 2003, but it is certainly worth a viewing, and is simply a good story very well-told.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The west, where the men are principled and the woman...not so much.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Right off the bat I have to say that I preferred Kevin Costner and Duvall's cowboy ("Open range" film, and Duvall's TV series ("Broken trail") as well.This one is a minimalized picture: a small town with barely a citizen; no sweeping vistas; terse pithy dialog. The story is also minimal. It starts off as the familiar plot of two good guys standing up for justice against the bad guys. They're not only good, but brave, and not prone to shirk their duty, which is to clean up the mining town of the nasty Rancher (Jeremy Irons) and his crew.Into this they throw Renee Zellwegger, who nearly undoes the movie. Renee does her best work as a character actor, or plucky Jane Doe where here plump and squinchy face can fit the role. She is not, however, suited to roles which call for a mixture of a Jezebel hiding behind demurity. With John C. Reilly -in "Chicago"- yes, with Ed Harris and Vigo Mortensen and Jeremy Irons as the available studs: no.She not only nearly undoes the movie but the stalwart heroes, as well. Not because they compete for her, but because her eye roves to whichever alpha male sends out his musk. This casual disloyalty is handled quite differently than in other "a man's gotta do....." movies. Our hero, a stoic, occasionally volcanic, Ed Harris, is tops at shooting and beating up on people, but way shy with a sophisticated Renee plays Piano)city gal to whom reliability is a bore.Vigo, his sidekick, sees what she is, and Harris does too, but is loathe to lose her, and so we are deprived of the obligatory "good guy, kills the bad guy,wins the girl and rides off into the sunset" ending.Instead we get a very different version of it, and it left me bemused.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's a western, about good guys and bad ones. No surprise there. It's a story about love. No surprise there either. It's a story about friendship. Nothing to rock the familiar or stand out above a thousand other story lines we have seen over and over again.However, the movie stands out in how it connects all the three. It stands out in the superb acting, in wonderful play of emotions and in how we witness what it means to be good, to be in love and to be a true friend. You will connect to the characters here in how strong they are and yet how frail they are. It will remind you how things are rarely in black and white and more often that not in shades of gray. It's been a while since I have seen a movie like this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great classic western filled with dynamic and moving performances</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I decided to watch this film after reading a review in Empire magazine which praised it highly... I wasn't disappointed. Ed Harris has crafted a superb classic Western from Robert B. Parker's novel. I saw Pollock a few years back and both films he has directed have been filled with the kind of gentle touch that allows the actors the room necessary to turn out great performances. Even if you are not a fan of Harris, I would still give this one a try. The combination of Ed Harris as Virgil Cole and Viggo Mortensen as Everett Hitch is perfectly suited to the story, setting and era and both do a great job of stepping into their characters with convincing ease. Their dialogue is spartan and often dry, both characters preferring to let their actions speak volumes. This is not a fast paced, action packed spectacle, rather it is a careful study into the lives of two men who are obviously very close after years of unspeakable acts in the name of 'peacekeeping'. The acting of these two main characters is superb, countered brilliantly by Jeremy Irons as the seemingly unscrupulous Randall Bragg. Irons is not at his best here and seems to struggle with the accent at times but still turns out a noteworthy performance. Renee Zellweger adds an interesting dynamic as Allison French, Cole's eventual love interest, and even though she suffers from some large character flaws, isn't entirely unlikeable in the end. Overall this film has the kind of delicate hand with the camera that Dean Semler (Apocalypto, Waterworld, Dances with Wolves) is renowned for. The sweeping landscapes match the characters that populate this story: vast and unmoving but still captivating. I recommend this film for people who like to watch a film and be moved by characters rather than just excited by explosions and an escalating body-count. Harris proves his worth as a director again and I look forward to more from him.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Flat, clichéd, boring</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The opening scene, with the ever-awful Jeremy Irons killing a bunch of lawmen over nothing much, gave me a bit of an 'uh-oh' moment. How many times have we seen this scene since the Western genre began? Then, in the next scene, when a panic-stricken, bib-clutching chambermaid rushes in to tell the marshal and his deputy that some of the local bad boys are cutting up rough over at the saloon, and that they'd better git on over there mighty quick (okay, I'm paraphrasing a bit - but not much), it dawned on me. Of course! This was a send-up of the Western. Not quite A Fistful of Dollars, perhaps. Certainly not Blazing Saddles. But a send-up, nevertheless.Unfortunately, no. Within another 10 minutes, I came to the sad conclusion that this film actually took itself seriously. Sad because it meant that the great promise offered - Ed Harris as co-writer, director and star, and Viggo Mortensen as co-star - was never going to pay off. I've always admired Harris as a actor. So what on earth possessed him to think that this was a film worth making, let alone putting himself top of the bill in? The dialogue is so cliché-ridden it's laughable. The plot is about as old and creaky as a saloon bar door. And the characterisation is virtually non-existent. What little we learn about the past lives of the two central protagonists does nothing to flesh them out as believable characters. Feeble attempts are made to give them life - most notably Harris's verbal tic, in which he stumbles on certain long words and needs Mortensen to help him out. These moments do provide a bit of light, almost comic relief. The sets and cinematography, too, are good, giving a convincing and authentic sense of the old West. It's just a shame they couldn't have been put to better use.In all, a pretty lousy film. Not as bad as some, but nowhere near as good as it ought to have been. It's no surprise at all that it went straight to DVD.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"...A Man can Do That"This ain't no spaghetti western with 5,000 improbable gunfights... It ain't gunfight driven at all. It is story and character driven.The town of Appaloosa looks great, you wonder how much longer there will be places like that in the world, the surrounding country looks like so many John Ford westerns that were filmed way up in Utah... But this was in Texas and maybe a couple of other places.I got to respect Ed Harris for directing and acting... Actually I've always thought of Ed Harris as "John Glenn" ever since "The Right Stuff," that little scene in the bathroom stalls and what he starts singing... But he continually busts out of any would-be stereotype, film after film. I like the fact that Lance Henrickson is finally given an A-List movie to work at, because that dumb pirate film he was in a few years back was pretty low to the bottom of the barrel- The great thing about his character was that you know there was going to be a confrontation, but that prospect did not affect his friendship with Cole.Viggo really steals this, although there is not really any competition between the two mains, even for the woman where you'd think there would be some competition.This film is not what you expect, and of all the modern westerns, this one stands out.It kind of fills the expectations I had for the recent remake of 3:10 to Yuma- Not that 3:10 to Yuma was really a bad film, both versions, but this one is a traditional western, all the way.If there IS to be a sequel I'd like to see it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unusually historically accurate; excellent movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was a most pleasant surprise! I have enjoyed Westerns for longer than most who will see this film have been alive, and this one stands out from almost every one made for the past thirty years. Set in 1882, the film never strays from historical accuracy: John Wayne movies (and other Weserns as well) were famous for being set in the 1870's or 1880's and he is carrying a Model 1892 Winchester. Duh! Not so with Appalloosa. The weapons, the costumes, and the general atmosphere were excellent, and accurate in every noticeable detail. The characters were believable - even if Renee Zelwigger plays a fruitcake - and not one of them was so much of a stereotype as to be unbelievable, or to detract from the plot in the least. Appaloosa is well done, and well worth the cost of a ticket, and even of the DVD to keep this little gem in one's collection.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nothing of the old soppy Clint Eastwood fantasies-- this seemed authentic! Grand cinema!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For a non-fan of the Western genre, I must say I enjoyed this film! And, despite the fact that Appaloosa, New Mexico is actually almost 2,000 miles from the REAL "Palouse" (a prairie region on the Washington-Idaho border, and the source for the name of the famous horse breed, "a Palouse horse"; and eventually "appaloosa" horse), I got the sense of more or less authentic period settings.One thing absent from this movie, which I found refreshing, was the lack of the old school movie logic of the tragic hero, and the whole Western theme. Those themes were fine, I guess, back in the day, early in TV, and way back in cinema history. But those themes also ring a bit false--- overly dramatic, in fact melodramatic, and as fake and sugary, in their way, as any Doris Day or Rock Hudson movie.This film's theme seemed to me to be about how I'd do it. That doesn't make it real, nor better, of course. But it did, for me, ring true. Despite the Clint Eastwood - Steve McQueen - Yul Brenner history in movies, actual history (not the sensationalised 1800's novels and tabloid stories written by Easterners who never even visited the old west, let alone reported anything real) is closer to THIS film's portrayal.The ending was just right SPOILER-- the bad guy was killed simply, and without fanfare. The hero buddies made the inevitable decision to part ways, but realistically. And the whores continued to ply their trades (I am referring to the "professional" whore, whose name I didn't catch, and the de facto whore played by Renee Zellwegger). Kind of mundane. Not heroic or poetic or pretty--- BUT, exactly as I, and maybe you, would have done.Superb acting all around makes this a pure pleasure to watch!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fine old style western with modern detailing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a Western addict, I didn't expect too much from this as the IMDb rating was only 6.8. However, I was bowled over by it! The straight opening scene drew the viewer in and established two things immediately. The badness of the Jeremy Irons character and the rough, dirty environment in which the plot would be played out. There would be nothing slick or sentimental about this film. Then we got the narrative from the second of the three main characters, played by Viggo Mortensen. The reason the two further characters in this film are riding together across open, dry, brown landscape, is explained and you know you're in for a damned good, hard nosed ride into classic western good vs.bad showdown territory! I love this film, because it delivers exactly what it says on the tin. Ed Harris is the life weary Marshall who will not compromise with the town's bye-laws, and the film is only slightly let down when his eye leaves the ball to follow a female diversion in the form of Renee Zellweger. Her presence is necessary to the plot and the final shootout, however in my opinion, she gets too much screen time. Talking of shootouts, this film contains many of them, all quite different, heavy with fine detail, and all relevant. By the end you're left feeling you've spent some serious time with saddle leather, colt handguns, dust and bourbon whisky, and the three main characters themselves. Oh - and heard some fine songs as well!</fullReview>

I mean how? How exactly this could be possible in the wild west?Otherwise it is an OK movie, worth watching, though towards the end it becomes a boring mixture of revenge and love, not quite understandable.By the way, it is worth to watch the movie just to see Viggo Mortensen's stunning act!</fullReview>

My opinion is that she did not fit the role at all. She did not fit the character profile. I heard that Diane Lane was the 1st choice, but she did not do it. RZ seemed to be distracting to a great story line as well as giving a weak performance. I actually saw the movie before I read the book. RZ's character was much more fitting for the part as portrayed in the book. I would love to see Ed and Viggo team up again for another movie adaptation of a Robert B. Parker western.

		<fullReview>British actor Jeremy Irons got to do a western for his list of credits with Appaloosa. Let no one think that this is a remake of the Marlon Brando western from the Sixties. Appaloosa is not a breed of horse, it's a town in New Mexico territory where lawmen Ed Harris and Viggo Mortensen have been hired to prevent the depredations of villain Jeremy Irons.Irons is a villain with some interesting connections. Right at the beginning of Appaloosa we're told that Irons came west from New York City where apparently he was part of Roscoe Conkling's political machine. He worked in the Customs House where the boss was the Collector for the Port Of New York one Chester Alan Arthur. Time and circumstance have sent Irons to New Mexico where he's bought himself a spread and hired a lot of guns who terrorize the town and surrounding area. Time and circumstance have also made Chester Alan Arthur President of the United States. Despite some rivalry over Renee Zellweger, Harris and Mortensen are a pair of no nonsense lawmen who do their best to clean up Appaloosa. Irons also shows that those connections to the White House are quite real.Arthur did not do a half bad job as president considering where he originated from. This film does cast him in a negative light because of an association with a skunk like Irons. Appaloosa is a good western with a good ensemble cast using a bit of historical trivia as part of the plot.</fullReview>

Also, that 10 gauge shotgun is a metaphor for his dong. The bad dude in the movie is also very well acted. The whole movie you're just begging for revenge on the guy (I won't spoil the ending for you though) The only reason I took off a star is because Renee Zelwigger is freakin weird looking and her character drives me nuts, which makes her numerous spankings (both verbal and physical) from Ed Harris all the more satisfying. Overall a great blend of a traditional western with the building vengeance and methodical pace, mixed with elements of the modern. I give the bromantic part 10/10, 9/10 overall</fullReview>

It took 30-minutes into the movie for me to realise that it was not a comedy and that it was actually meant to be taken seriously. Irons, Zellweger, Spall and Mortensen are the least convincing Western characters imaginable and for Ed Harris to put his name to it (as Director, screenplay writer and actor) is probably the greatest mistake(s) he's ever made. Sorry Ed, it don't get much worse than this. Never mind the worthless awards, this is rubbish of the first order. Still, locations and costumes were decent. Just a pity about everything else.

The same buddies, here Cole and Everett, there Fonda and Quinn, coming in to serve as existential vacuum cleaners on some out of control rancher played well by Irons. In both movies, the friendship of the two gunmen plus the psychology of the gunman is the cynosure of the movies. Harris, always an underrated actor, plays Cole with great complexity. The act of shooting people has the moral content of opening a door; when Allison, later in the movie, tries to understand his suicidal fearlessness, he looks at her mystified. Hello? I have been doing this for decades, I don't even think about it, if I die, I die. There is zero bravado in Cole, but a deep sense of pride; when the brothers makes him look like an idiot, rescuing Bragg from their custody, the matter is not open for discussion: they must die. As in Warlock, the chemistry between the two men is the other star of the movie; Everett serves as a surrogate brain for Cole, providing needed vocabulary, and translating motives that seem recondite to Virgil. This is the other treat, the unflattering delineation of the gunfighter; Cole may be lightening fast but his mind is not commensurately quick. Everyone is getting the better of him: the brothers, Allison and Bragg, the latter has him all ready to be run out of town, if Everett hadn't intervened. The ontology of the gunfighter has such a greater feeling of verisimilitude; as in all things, those who are gifted in one area usually exhibit gross deficiencies in others. I like a few of Wayne's movies, not many, but the intellectual cowboy tends to be a trifle oxymoronic. Notice here, Everett is not nearly as fast with his weapon as Cole but his mind is much quicker. They form a symbiotic dyad, each one compensates for the other's deficiency. That is why Cole knew what a risk Hitch was taking in his calling Bragg out. You can see in Virgil's face his worry over Everett's fate. Even as Everett rides away, we have a sense of foreboding, for Cole simply is not very good on his own. Just as in Warlock, Quinn was doing all the necessary dirty work to keep Fonda's legend alive, here, Everett does all the thinking, gently steering Virgil as best he can. The final showdown with Bragg is an example of Virgil refusing to budge; his deep pride always blinding him, both with Allison's mercenary philandering and the brothers' nefarious activities.The Native Americans are refreshingly hostile here, no, they don't break out the gifts and drink coffee, sorry. Harris' coldness is a trait rarely seen, except in Johnny Ringo in Tombstone. Here, Virgil gives a warning at the bar, when he is mocked, game on, no more talking. Harris gives Virgil Cole a coldness that reminded me of Carradine's Wild Bill in Deadwood. This icy, cold indifference to others, like when he takes that guys teeth out of his head, refreshingly free of the usual Hollywood idealization. As a reviewer, the best I can do for you is to say this is an analysis of the psychology of a dyad of gunfighters, not, repeat not, an action filled Western. There are a few gunfights but they are sparse, as in Warlock, the story is the friendship between the two men and how they work symbiotically off of each other. Unlike Warlock, there is a greater emphasis on showing the deficits in the gunfighter, emotionally, psychologically and ethically. Cole simply has plenty of blind spots, his pride will not allow him to entertain reality about people he has accepted, like Allison. This was what emboldened Allison to make a move on Everett, by the way. I own the movie for its psychological depth, verisimilitude and the great performances by two good actors. Harris give his signature reading in this movie. A Good, If Atypical Western. Q.E.D.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Appaloosa" is a good, fast-paced western. And while the movie is about two hours long, it doesn't seem like a long movie at all because the story is interesting and captivating.The story is about marshall Virgil Cole and deputy Everett Hitch who has come to Appaloosa to uphold the law and to investigate the disappearance of the former marshall and deputy.Usually westerns have a tendency to be full of clichés, but I didn't really think that to be the case in "Appaloosa". And director Ed Harris managed to put together an entertaining movie with a solid and proper storyline.The cast in the movie was quite good, and Viggo Mortensen and Ed Harris were both doing amazing jobs in "Appaloosa". But also impressively was Jeremy Irons; his usual overacting and dramatizations wasn't there, and he put on one of his best performances of his career. And there was a great appearance by Lance Henriksen.It should also be said that the atmosphere and mood of "Appaloosa" was really good, and it was like you were actually there in the gritty, dusty old west.If you enjoy westerns, then you should most definitely watch "Appaloosa".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Lonesome Dove of a Western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After Lonesome Dove the Western changed forever. Appaloosa follows perfectly in this genre, keeping to the theme of the story revealing character. Appaloosa displays such great direction in allowing moments of character revelation (which is reliant on great acting) and to take the time to allow it to happen and consequently made the movie a little short for me. I finished watching and immediately wanted a sequel because I cared about what happened next to the characters .....funny thing...Lonesome Dove was based on a novel that had to be a series, and Appaloosa is a Western movie that should have become another series....Appaloosa to me is like watching episode one of Lonesome Dove...you look forward to the next and the next...well done everyone....</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is not a movie about good guys versus bad guys. The main theme of the movie is loyalty, and the main characters are Virgil (Ed Harris)and Everett (Viggo Mortenson). The villain Randall (Jeremy Irons) and The love interest Allison (Renée Zellweger) are secondary characters. If you think westerns are all about nonstop action and the hero defeating the villains, you will be disappointed like the others who reviewed this film poorly. If you enjoy a good story and exploration of character, then I think that you might enjoy this film. There are few good modern westerns because of the belief that action is the only important element to its success. (The remake of 3:10 to Yuma is a perfect example. It has plenty of action but is a poor movie with a completely unbelievable ending when compared to the original which is an excellent psychological drama.) Congratulations to the makers of Appaloosa for not sacrificing a good story at the altar of meaningless action. In the end, this made the action scenes all the more believable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I must admit that I enjoyed this film well enough, primarily because the cinematography was incredible and it looked and felt like a classic western which was what drew me in and encouraged me to keep watching. However, I'm not rating this film very highly because the screenplay just wasn't cutting it. I understand that in a western what really matters is the setting and the action, which was fantastic, but the dialogue was awkward, particularly in the way the marshal and deputy chose to speak to each other. There were no memorable lines, not a lot of witty banter and it seemed like the screenplay was just pieced together last minute without much thought. The acting also seemed really shallow and hollow, and I feel like this is partly due to the lines the actors had to deliver, which didn't help their roles any. Not worth the 2 hours, unless you're looking for a film that looks (but doesn't sound) good.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Despite a few pacing issues and the woefully miscast Renée Zellweger, "Appaloosa" still comes out strong. What makes this movie worthwhile (and the movie seems to know this) is the relationship between the two main characters. Virgil Cole and Everett Hitch are two of the most interesting characters in a Western, and it also helps that they're extremely well cast (indeed, Ed Harris is the man I pictured when first reading the book). Jeremy Irons also plays a real douche of a bad guy, and there are a few well-done shootouts. But it's that bond between the mercenary lawmen that keeps me coming back. And I wish this movie had done well enough to merit more big-screen entries. 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It was very moral film. Savvy lawmen who were honest &amp; told the truth, who never killed except to uphold the law. They defined integrity. I liked the quirkiness of the characters, e.g. the town leaders (Spall) funny bickering; "sequestered" and the other words that Mortenson defines for Harris. These vocabulary exchanges symbolized their relationship built on friendship, loyalty, &amp; mutual trust. Sometimes it tried a bit too hard &amp; it felt forced, perhaps because of the lack of flow in Irons' forced accent (why not let him be English??he ends up importing that English steer anyway) &amp; Zellweger's weirdness. Zellweger played her flawed character like Harris told her, but she needed to show a darker side?not just the insecure lunatic who was scared of everything. She was the antithesis of the men's morality, so why didn't she get punished? We didn't get stereotypical natives, but characters who accepted the horse because they had integrity. Hell, everyone had more integrity than her. The end showed Mortenson accepting her two- faced immorality only because Harris had affirmed that he wouldn't leave her. With this declaration, Mortenson had no other choice in the end but to move on (to take care of himself) &amp; kill Irons (to aid Harris). I get it, but I didn't like it as an invested movie viewer who thought she was trash and didn't deserve him.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well, it's OK as far as it goes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The cast is great and provided outstanding acting. Their characters are highly interesting. It's well worth watching once but the story-line becomes increasingly implausible as the movie unfolds.A small one-street one-horse town is having problems with Jeremy Irons, the rich cattle baron who thinks he owns the place and his men have no problems with shooting-up both the town and anybody they want at the drop of a hat.So, the town fathers hire Ed Harris and Viggo Mortensen to bring law and order to the town.And along comes Renee Zellweger who arrives in town and needs a job, and she can play the piano and winds up with a job at the saloon.OK, so far a standard plot line.Here's where the spoilers start: Jeremy (the bad guy) also owns this elaborate and ornate saloon that no one-horse town in the middle of nowhere can support. But that's where Renee gets a job behind the piano.Jeremy murders a deputy marshal at his ranch. Ed and Viggo go out to arrest him. He's tried, convicted and sentenced to death.On his way by train to go to the place of execution, Jeremy's gang get's him released while the train is at a remote water stop, with Renee with them as a hostage.She'll be released when they're safely away. Well, O.K. But why can't the train just go forward until it's out of sight, they release Renee, ride away, and the train backs up to get her? After all, everyone knows that there are no horses in a freight car for them to pursue the bad guys and get Renee.Eventually, Ed and Viggo have the horses and supplies they need and finally have the bad guys in sight, along with a bunch of hostile Indians who are about to attack the bad guys for their horses and weapons.The Indians attack. One scene has Renee, in her underwear, kicking and screaming while slung over an Indians shoulder. However, for some miraculous reason, Renee and Jeremy survive. The rest of the bad guys were either dead or fled. (Maybe the Indians decided not to steal her because they didn't have a piano.) O.K. Jeremy is recaptured. The team arrives at the nearest town and Jeremy is placed in the local jail for safe keeping while they figure out what to do next. But Jeremy and the local sheriff are friends.To cut to the chase: Jeremy, the evil local sheriff and the sheriff's deputies have a shoot-out with Ed and Viggo. Everybody gets killed or wounded except Jeremy, who escapes out of town on a galloping horse.Later, back at the one-horse town, Ed gets a telegram that states President Chester A. Author has granted a pardon to Jeremy for murdering an officer of the law. Jeremy swaggers back to town as a free man.But what about his gang's kidnapping Renee to demand his release from the train? What about the shoot-out at the evil sheriff's town, where people were murdered? Why wasn't that sheriff brought to justice?Aren't they all crimes, too? I guess they didn't want all of that to interfere with the story-line and people just wouldn't notice or care.Anyway, by the end of the movie, bad guys never win.Again, I think the actors and the characters they portrayed are great. But, wow, there are also a bunch of "Huh?????? This doesn't make sense" moments to make this a higher rated movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great western look slowed by love interest</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's 1882 New Mexico Territory. Randall Bragg (Jeremy Irons) and his ranch hands are terrorizing the city of Appaloosa, and killed all their law officers. Virgil Cole (Ed Harris) and Everett Hitch (Viggo Mortensen) are the new lawmen hired by the desperate town fathers. This is a standard grim shoot them up western. That is until Allison French (Renée Zellweger) arrives in town, and she injects a complicated love interest into this movie.This looked pretty good at the start. When Zellweger showed up, the movie slowed down. There are too many complications going on here with French. And the story needs a much bigger climatic shootout.It has all the elements of look, style, actors, but the story needs more streamlining. There are too many little sideways moves. For example just when the movie should be ending, the bad guy gets a pardon from the president. I guess this is from a novel, but sometimes a novel is to big to film. Harris needs to take a hacksaw to some of the story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Small town, minute western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A small town plagued by a seemingly omnipotent rancher Randall Bragg (Jeremy Irons) rules the small town of Appaloosa with little fret of the long hand of the law, gunning down the local sheriff and his deputies without remorse. Frightened for their wealth and stature the richest inhabitants of the town decide to pool together to hire mercenary lawmen Virgil Cole (Ed Harris) and his comrade-in-arms Everett Hitch (Viggo Mortensen). The duo quickly reinstate law and order, albeit through drastic and strict measures, but inevitably find themselves opposing Bragg and his henchmen. The situation complicates further when a young widow Allison French (Renée Zellweger) rides into town and quickly becomes Virgil's love interest.Ed Harris's feature debut struggles from a somewhat slight overall feeling, as if striving for more to be a TV movie, than a fully fledged feature. Despite the strong cast and well-structured story the movie slowly unravels with an overuse of melodramatic effects. Several aspects of the movie do show the overall promise, such as the fall from grace of Cole and Hitch, which pinpoints the decrepit sense of justice, which permeates through structures of power. Virgil and Everett end up as simplistic players, who search for a visible line drawing up justice, right and wrong, whereas the outside world haggles for power and prestige, more intent on self-interested betterment than upholding the law. This twist is a welcome feature, which uplifts the latter part of the movie, but overall the lax storytelling fails to build tension and integrate with the key protagonists, proving to be a tedious effort with clunky dialogue, which asks way too much from attention spans.Somewhere within this odious piece of cinema lay a huge potential, as the ideas do manage to filter through the poor dramaturgy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Westerns don't come along too frequently. Good ones even rarer. This is a good one.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>They don't make Westerns like they used to? and by that I mean they just don't make many Westerns period these days. Rotten Tomatoes lists only 33 Westerns in the dubbos with enough reviews to get a rating, and basically half of those were deemed rotten (the chicks with guns flick Bandidas inexplicably gets a Fresh rating, Shanghai Noon is another!).My Dad grew up on Westerns, still watches pretty much exclusively Westerns and was the only reason behind me plucking Appaloosa from the video shop shelf recently. Having less than 2 films per year in his favourite genre must suck ? and by reckoning half of those weren't true "Black hat ? White hats facing down at sunup" Westerns.Less than one a year? Appaloosa was one of the 17 good ones.########################################As Appaloosa adheres to the Western tradition of keeping things simple the story has two tough looking gents a-riding into the town of Appaloosa one day as the previous sheriff is now feeding the worms.These two gents have been hired by the town's big-wigs to keep the peace and basically protect the citizens from a ruthless local rancher Randall Bragg (Jeremy Irons) and his men who exhibit ? to coin a phrase ? outlawish tendencies.Virgil is a quick draw and a quick thinker, his main asset is perhaps the fact that he knows that while quick he can't take down too many guns at once, and while a thinker he might not be the most intellectual man in the wild west. To remedy this he rides with Everett, who is similarly quick on the draw but carries a big "Don't argue" shotgun and fills in the gaps in Virgil's vocabulary when called upon. The duo set upon restoring peace to the sleepy town, firstly by letting Bragg and minions know that they aren't having things their own way from now on.A tenuous stalemate comes to pass for a time? then a woman arrives to ruin it.My only issue with this film is the fact that the woman who has arrived into Appaloosa by train, Allison French, is played by Renee Zellweger ? I know it must have been said but she looks like she's just swallowed a whole lemon at all times ? and it's only worse when she *GULP* smiles. With a look like that I am genetically predisposed to detesting every noise or line that she emits thereafter, and I did here. (Even my Dad said "I wouldn't get shot for her" at one point.)Allison quickly realises that Virgil is the Top Gun in Appaloosa and hooks her claws into him. Bragg equally swiftly works out Virgil's new fugly weakness and arranges for Allison to be taken, and Virgil inexplicably doesn't just decide "Phew, I nearly married it" but decides to head after them.And then the film proceeds as cowboy films must, with saddle sores, gruff terse dialogue and quick shootin'. To describe more would be a disservice to the film, suffice to say Appaloosa is an entertaining film, the action is scarce on the ground but carries an impact when it arrives, the effortless interplay between chatty Virgil and the more reticent and thoughtful Everett is well written and often amusing, and Irons creates a solid bad guy as Randall Bragg whose larger than life demeanour steals each scene that he appears in.Being born a little late to fully get into the Western genre I must admit I seldom look them up, but if I see a trailer that looks gritty and realistic I will pick them up at the video shop, if they were all of the calibre of Appaloosa and weren't released so far apart this might happen more frequently.Final Rating ? 6.5 / 10. Westerns don't come along too often these days, good ones even less frequently. This is an solid, efficient and entertaining Western that manages to overcome Zellweger's lamentable cat's a*se of a face.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What's The Word I'm Looking For ?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the Wild West of 1882, Cole and Hitch are two marshals hired to protect the town of Appaloosa from local bigshot Bragg's gang. They arrest Bragg, but can they hold on to him, and who can they trust ?This enjoyable, no-nonsense, traditional western is a great success for director, star, co-writer and co-producer Harris. It's very much a story about people and relationships - to what extent is Cole dependent upon Hitch, is Ally a harlot or simply a free spirit, why is Hitch content with playing second fiddle. The characters are archetypes, but they have very human foibles and needs, and the fine ensemble cast fill their boots magnificently. One of the reasons they don't make a lot of westerns these days is there aren't too many actors left who can dress in black, strap on a pistol rig and say, "Howdy pardner" without looking ridiculous but this cast fit just fine, with Mortensen in particular outstanding. There's a commendable emphasis on authenticity - period shotguns, a lack of cosmetic makeup, dust blowing everywhere, gunfights that are over in seconds - which creates a strong atmosphere, but there's also much humour and badinage, particularly in Cole and Hitch's laconic conversations. Perhaps the plot is a tad sparse but that suits the characters here. Westerns are the one genre I'm a little ambivalent about; some are outstanding but quite a few turn me off if they start to wax lyrical about frontier sensibilities or truth and justice. The key thing for me is if they have characters I can identify with, as is the case here. Featuring excellent photography by great Australian cameraman Dean Semler, shot mostly in the beautiful deserts of New Mexico, and based on a fine book by Robert B. Parker, better known as the author of the Spenser series of crime novels. Stick around for the end credits, which feature a terrific song by Tom Petty/Mudcrutch called Scare Easy, and then another sung by Harris himself !</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Based on the Novel by Robert B.Parker, Ed Harris directed 'Appaloosa' is an interesting western flick, that offers entertainment in the goings-on. 'Appaloosa' tells the story of a Marshall and a Deputy respectively, who come to clean an unclean small-town. The Screenplay Written by Harris himself, along-with Robert Knott is interesting and offers a punch. However, I found the Sub-Plot, the love-story, as half-baked. The main plot holds you, but the sub-plot doesn't. In terms of Direction, Harris surely knows the job. Cinematography is perfect. Editing is passable. Art-Design is good. Performance-Wise: Harris has always been a super actor, and here's another performance that proves that fact. Viggo Mortensen is hugely effective. Zellweger isn't at her best, but Jeremy Irons is in form. Lance Henriksen &amp; Timothy Spall are okay. On the whole, An Interesting Western flick. Go for It!</fullReview>

It might have been an average story for a simple TV western 50 years ago; that's about the best thing I can say about it.The acting is mediocre. The top three male leads give some of the most mediocre performances of their lives. The only good performance is by Rene Zellweger and the supporting characters.There is also some kind of strange vaguely homo-erotic thing between the two protagonists. This isn't necessarily a negative, but it can be off- putting if you're not interested in this type of plot point.There is also action and some plot points that are so dumb it becomes painful to watch. In just one example, the seriously outgunned protagonists decided to take their prisoner and horses right through a big gang of outlaws and their horses. It would have been easy for the outlaws to smother the protagonists when they did this.Ed Harris's character really deserved to be killed. He exhibited some of the worst decision making I've ever seen. I fast forwarded through the last 35 minutes of the movie feeling I had already wasted 80 minutes of my life.</fullReview>

The pleasure was mine, to work with Ed Harris (as his carpenter building his house) as well as working with Viggo Mortensen. The parts cut, were detailed, slow, and told the reason why the town was dying and it's chance for revival. We worked the scenes daily, until Ed Harris was satisfied. He didn't like us to fake anything, even by actually sawing a railing 2X4 my helper and I were measuring.We were interfered with by a disgruntled stunt coordinator, circling his aircraft overhead. That buckboard scene had to be cut of course. I enjoyed pleasant, dark evenings sometimes spent waiting near the excellent mounts tied behind the buildings. Base camp food catering was great, as well as 'set holding' snacks. We were treated very well by this production company.Viggo Mortensen was great to talk to us anytime, even playing a bit of soccer during base camp breaks (pics on Da Flikkers). He described his weapons to me, as the armorer was disarming him after our last shoot. The Night scene with torches, where he confronts Bragg in the saloon. Ed Harris shook our hands afterward, and thanked us individually for our help.My family and friends enjoyed the rare 'Family' oriented movie that resulted. I would like to work again anytime with that cast. Robert B. Parker has another 'Hitch and Cole' adventure. Maybe Ed will possibly be interested? The daily events 'on set' were posted on Da Flikkers.

		<shortDescription>Appaloosa</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Eight years since his directorial debut with Pollock, Ed Harris returns to the director's chair with this western. Set in 1882, in the New Mexico Territory, lawmen Virgil Cole (Harris) and Everett Hitch (Viggo Mortensen) are hired by the town of Appaloosa to bring justice against the thugs hanging round, including Randall Bragg (Jeremy Irons). Arriving in the town is pretty and good-natured widow Allison French (Renée Zellweger), who Virgil falls for, but there may be more to her than meets the eye. An employee of Bragg offers to testify against him when Virgil and Everett take him to court, where he is sentenced to death by hanging. Bragg manages to escape the train transporting him when his gang abducts Allie, and after a swap they are still his tail. There is a shoot-out where Virgil and Everett are shot but survive, and the film ends with Bragg being shot by Virgil, and narration from Everett saying that he left Virgil and Allie to work things out, while he goes back on the road. Also starring Timothy Spall as Phil Olson, Lance Henriksen as Ring Shelton, Tom Bower as Abner Raines, James Gammon as Earl May, Ariadna Gil as Katie, Rex Linn as Sheriff Clyde Stringer and Bob L. Harris as Judge Elias Callison. Harris does well with acting, directing, producing and writing, with Mortensen, Zellweger and Irons completing a good cast in quite a good revival of the genre. Very good!</fullReview>

It is a great took at Western and the actors and actresses made the film original, moody, and very refreshing. I can't remember the last time I felt so much for a movie. All the characters actually did come to life and the cinematography is so absorbing you can't help but become a part of it. This is a movie with a soul, not just another beautiful scenery and gunfights on screen. Parker would be proud of this adaptation.Some people complain about the pacing, that it's too slow and that it's totally anti-climatic. Well, that's just the only way the movie is going to work. With a faster pace, it would become the all-American entertainment Tombstone or the taut Seraphim Falls. This movie has its trademark that is signed by Ed Harris. And we love this movie for it. Great directing, great acting, great scenes, great characters, and most of all...one of the best films of the year.9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Value of Restraint</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Appaloosa is worth seeing and that's the main attribute one needs to know about it. The thing to do with Ed Harris's new western is simply to sit down and take it in.The plot isn't enthralling, but that doesn't much matter. Good guys are hired by community leaders to clean up a town in the grip of a very bad guy. You've seen the tale often before. But its staleness doesn't get in the way of a film that presents friendship as tellingly as Appaloosa does. Truth is, it adds to it in a classic way.Virgil Cole (Ed Harris) and Everett Hitch (Viggo Mortensen) are gunmen who hire themselves out as enforcers of the law. They have a somewhat different vision of what the law is. Virgil believes in it with a childlike simplicity, whereas Everett sees it as a convenient support for what they do. But as with every other difference between them, their varying views of legality never get in the way of their complete loyalty to one another.They are not bullies. They don't prefer to kill other men. It's just that they continually put themselves in situations where they can't do anything else. And, then, they do it very well.We are led to believe that Appaloosa would have been just one more assignment in a long-running saga were it not for that always complicating feature of western heroism -- a woman. Allison French, a comely young widow, comes to town with just a single dollar in her pocket, and Virgil falls for her as he never has for another woman. She is neatly dressed, speaks correctly, and is clean. And for Virgil, whose previous female companionship has been limited to squaws and whores, that's enough.Everett sees pretty quickly that Allison's character doesn't match up to her bodily neatness. But his support for Virgil is subtle enough that he understands she provides his partner with something he longs for deeply and that he's not likely to get ever again. So, he goes along.Virgil is not a simpleton and he discovers over the course of the film what Allison is. But, then, there's still the cleanness, and the well prepared meals, and the comfort of an orderly house. And he wants them, despite his knowledge that he can't count on Allison one minute past the time when he's no longer top dog in town. You're unlikely to find a more clear-eyed, mature depiction of what matters in everyday life, and we would all be healthier if we took greater account of it.It seems to be a daring thing lately to make a film that relies on interesting characters and fine acting. The four principals here, Ed Harris, Viggo Mortensen, Rene Zellweger, and Jeremy Irons do their work as well as you can imagine it being done. Just watching them play off against one another would be more than worth the price of admission even if there were no plot at all. But the plot in Appaloosa does just what it needs to do, and not a whit more.Restraint is written all over this production, and I wish we had a Hollywood that understood its value far more than it does.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Western in Years</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This fine western is more like the classics such as 'Shane' from the 40's and 50's, when the genre reached its artistic peak, than the ultra-violent post-Wild Bunch school. This is a refreshing and welcome change of pace. The progressive increase in violence, misogyny and sadism since the 1960's, although yielding some admitted classics such as 'Unforgiven,' is an ultimately an artistic dead end.'Appaloosa' is a western that contains interesting and plausible characters, some of whom you will identify with, struggling with the human condition in various aspects, as the plot unfolds in an interesting manner. There are some good gun fights, there is horse back riding, there is wonderful scenery, excellent photography, and fine acting.This movie is paced more like the classic westerns than today's action movies, where someone gets tortured, killed, or blowed up about every 2 minutes because the director thinks all the 14 year old ADHD boys in the theater will go to sleep if he does otherwise. In my opinion, this is a great improvement over the recent '3:10 to Yuma,' which was too oppressively hyperactive and stupid for someone over 30 to enjoy.My wife, who is not nearly as keen on westerns as am I, enjoyed this movie almost as much as I did. As a fan of westerns, I give this movie an extra star because there are so few good westerns made anymore. A person not interested in westerns would probably give this an 8 or 9.Nonetheless, this is a very good movie for adults who like good movies, and a real treat for fans of classic westerns.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ed Harris writes, directs, sings, produces and stars but pulls it off.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a vanity project of sorts for Ed Harris, but he pulls it off. This is a sometimes funny fictional account of two former US Army men, one West Point educated, who hire themselves out in the 1880s old west to protect towns from the outlaw element.The movie starts with a murder of three men, one a Marshall, who show up at a ranch to arrest those responsible for killing a man and his family. But ranch boss Jeremy Irons as Randall Bragg will not have any of his men arrested, he shoots and kills them all, to the amazement of some of his men watching. Ed Harris is the "alpha male' Virgil Cole, known as a fast gun and a man of principle. He always tells the truth in any matter because it is easier than any other approach. His trusty sidekick is Viggo Mortensen as West Point man Everett Hitch. No one knows how good he is with a pistol because he always defers to Virgil and is fiercely loyal.So Cole and Hitch sign on to protect the fictional town Appaloosa, and they explain what the law is in that town. So what would happen if a single, pretty young woman were to show up? We find out when Renée Zellweger as Allison French steps off the stage coach and looks for a room. Cole takes a quick liking to her, and she begins to play piano in the saloon.In a small amount of nepotism Ed Harris' father, Bob L. Harris, plays the part of Judge Elias Callison. Ron Howard does it in all his movies, so why not Ed Harris? Ed also wrote and sings one of the songs in the closing credits and, while it isn't particularly good singing, it fits the mood of the rest of the movie.All in all a pretty good movie, and the two men spend most of their efforts trying to arrest and convict Bragg for the murders. I especially liked the character that Mortensen created. Do we really believe the good guys will prevail in the end? Yes, we do.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As westerns go, I felt this one really kept the feel of how original westerns felt. All acting came across really well, nothing was too overacted, and it's a sign that Ed Harris seems to have his finger on the trigger when it comes to his films.However, this is a western and as westerns go, they always seem to follow a very similar pattern, sheriff or two plus bad guys with a hint of a woman. You also say that about a lot of films, but with this film is a was a little predictable, although with the female character (Zellweger) there certainly was a nice little twist that was unexpected.If you like westerns then you could definitely do worse, this film is definitely watchable, and enjoyable for the most part. Guys do not fear, as your partners should be able to enjoy this film too. It's not all about gun fights and bullets, there is an underlying comical side and a very unusual love story involved, if you can call it that?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good effort, well performed.....but ONE HUGE casting mistake!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I like Westerns. I am of an age where I remember when they dominated movies and TV as CSI shows do now. With so few being made, I almost always give them a look.This is an Ed Harris project (starring, directed, adapted by) but the key character and best performance was given to and by Viggo Mortensen. The movie breaks no new Western ground (can there be?), but gives a sharp, well photographed focus of the old West. Buddies were buddies and had each others' back, baddies were baddies and justice was hired by townfolk living in fear. While Harris and Mortensen are not true white hats, they lean on the side of justice, and get paid pretty well for it. Jeremy Irons and crew run roughshod over Appalossa, kill city Marshals and are just no good. Will Justice prevail!? But enter Renee Zellwinger in what looks like it's going to be the traditional "school marm" role. She sets a different chemistry in motion and Harris and Mortensen's lives are spun around. Here is the film's BIG FLAW!!! A grating, preening, unconvincing, painful, cupie doll, horror of a performance by Zellwinger almost kills the proceedings. Her scrunchy face, maddening giggle and coyness were like fingernails..........! Whew! But the filming, dialogue, a few twists (gunfighting no longer includes a "quick draw") keep things interesting. A note about the dialogue and character relationships. The adapted book was by Robert B. Parker of "Spencer" (and later "Jesse Stone") fame. I felt a strong twinge of Spencer and Hawk in these character. That's not a bad thing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Decent Early Effort from Ed Harris</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I liked much of the acting, the story, the pace and quite a lot of the sets, but the music had some odd and distracting choices. One scene shows an evening view of the marshall's office and some blues music is played, which seems extremely out of place (like the rock tune during the credits.) A strong cast and a believable setting, but some language sounds a bit too much like present day speech to be believable. Also, some sets looked too much like a visit to a museum, possibly a bit overdone on the realism in a few areas.Ed Harris plays a contract for hire peacemaker who is skilled and has possesses a good bit of sense in regard to law and justice, but seems humanly lacking in worldliness. Viggo Mortensen plays a strong supporting character, all but overshadowing Harris' character. The good and the bad have sufficient shades of grey to remind me of the realistic series of Gunsmoke radio place. With a bit of tweaking this could have been Gunsmoke, to be honest.An enjoyable popcorn muncher I wouldn't mind seeing again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Appaloosa is a good solid Western! I love the directing, script, and writing. Ed Harris plays a good role as a crazed gun for hire sheriff. Virgo's character plays the other sheriff who has better social smarts. The plot unfolds with the women character who at first is the side story then with the plot twists becomes the main story is a great plot device. Great script! Ed's gunfighter with no social skills is played as a mark by the much socially smarter women. The movie has a two fold story of those with physical power Haris, and those with social power and how they socially interact and maintain power in a social setting. The social power was winning out in the movie. When the protagonists Harris in the story is losing out to the antagonist who can not beat out Harris physically but reverts to new tactics of socially taking over the town one see you can win a battle in more than one way. Well, all I can say is the violent side strikes back. Good movie 8 out of 10. A deep message.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Appaloosa (2008) 114 minutes Directed by Ed Harris Starring: Ed Harris,Viggo Mortensen, Renee Zellweger, Jeremy IronsWith the Westerns of last year (3:10 to Yuma, Jesse James, and No Country for Old Men), Appaloosa continues the strong comeback for the genre. Based on the Robert B. Parker book, Ed Harris co-writes, directs, and stars as the marshal, Virgil Cole, in this easy going, trigger happy film. Virgil goes on his business alongside life-long partner, deputy Everett Hitch (Mortensen). They are the law makers and the law enforcers of Appaloosa, a small town in 1882 troubled by a band of outlaws led by Randall Bragg (Irons). Virgil and Everett are rarely seen without each other side by side, and also rarely seen without a drink, their guns, and the preparation to put their life on the line to hold up the law. This is until the likes of a girl come into play. Her name is Allison French (Zellweger) and she immediately tickles Virgil's fancy. Her presence creates some friction between the marshal and deputy, but when asked Virgil makes it clear that he trusts Everett more than Allie.The movie concentrates on the bond between Virgil and Everett that is put to the test when Allie arrives and when Bragg escapes his hanging sentence. It's a well-paced Western that will not disappoint anyone familiar with the genre. Its blend of hard-hitting action with love between long-time friends and women is a bit foreign, but there's no doubt that Virgil and Everett are as bad-ass as any cowboys come.Harris is able to tell the story almost straightforward without any complexity that the more hardcore Western fans would like. But the way this movie flows should be embraced by a larger audience and will be a major play in the comeback of the Western genre. Although this isn't a great Western, it's a great and enjoyable film and proves Ed Harris can certainly make films as well as he can act.http://entertainmentblur.wordpress.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I just like westerns</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>and this one was pretty good even though the end was not too satisfying to me. But, that's movies today...whatever the ending might be logically and reasonably, it just may not be that way in films today, and especially when there is romantic involvement. Really liked Viggo M. as Everett and Ed H. as Virgil in their power roles as a Doc Holiday and Wyatt Earp-type team of for-hire lawmen, and they were their truly charismatic and well cast selves as those consultant lawmen cleaning up a bad town named Appaloosa just like Wyatt and Doc really did clean up Tombstone. Everett was the smarter backup sidekick and Virgil was the dumber number one bossman, just as it often happens in real life where the dumber one is the boss. The many times Everett had to supply Virgil with the correct word or definition to use while speaking was a smart, amusing and very effective touch, and even more so when it happened around deadly confrontations. Really excellent dialogue. Renee Z. as Ally was to me an odd choice for her role as a duplicitous woman, with her constant goofy smile and behavior, and especially in the presence of the two leads who were so well cast and powerful. In her role, after being finally found out as the treacherous and conniving two(or more)-timing crook she was, she amazingly got her man in the end too, even though he was pretty dumb about women and most other things besides gunplay so a great catch he was not. At least he loved her cheating self, but she only "loved" whomever was the top man at the time so the story obviously didn't end at the end of this movie. Everett instead was the obvious lucky man at the end of this film, but Virgil's fate? Don't even want to imagine it. Ally showed well that she was not a woman who would make much good of a "love relationship" with any one man.Jeremy Irons was the real bad guy here, and when he spoke he oddly sounded more like Sean Connery than his own voice, but he did do a pretty slick job in an odd role for him as a rich, bigshot rancher and businessman. Took me a while to identify who his voice sounded like, but you will hear it. The great New Mexico locations were so dramatic and desolate and really added so much to the authentic, stark feel of this well paced frontier story. Virgil even spoke in a stilted 19th century manner making the film sound more authentic in that way than many depicting that era. And, contrary to the draw and fire old west duels that didn't happen as often as we might think, the much more authentic and common "raise and fire" duels were shown here. The fine attempts at overall authenticity along with a clear and consistent story with a few interesting twists went a long way in making this a good 2 hours spent for me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Traditional, but slow burner</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let's get it straight right from the start - Appaloosa is not a classic western. It is, however, a good western.Appaloosa is a small town in the back of beyond, in thrall to rich local landowner Bragg (Jeremy Irons) and his thuggish ranch hands. Bragg kills the sheriff and his deputies, so the Councilmen hire Virgil Cole (Ed Harris) and his sidekick Everett Hitch (Viggo Mortensen), a pair of freelance gun-for-hire lawmen, to sort the problem out. These men have an easy, almost telepathic, relationship which become complicated once Allison "Ally" French (Renee Zellweger) comes to town - she pitches herself at Virgil and hooks him although, confusingly, she also makes advances to Everett, which he rejects. Bragg is caught and convicted, but his own hired guns use Ally as a lever to have him freed. There then follows a pursuit and resolution with some minor divergences from expectations.In many respects this is a completely traditional western, featuring a plot which has been seen, with variations, many, many times before. Ed Harris and Viggo Mortensen are settled into their parts, as comfortable as old clothes, before the movie begins, and the relationship between these two men is the strongest element of the movie by far. It is a handsome looking movie, although the camera was occasionally a little too jittery for my taste.But there are some problems. Zellweger's part is not only a thankless one, it also seems not to have been fully thought through. For a sizeable chunk of the movie it is far from clear where Ally's loyalties really lie, and at least two of the false(?) hints deserve better resolution than they get.Jeremy Irons' accent is simply awful - neither American nor English, nor even convincingly mid-Atlantic. He has done convincing American accents, but he doesn't do so here. He would have done better to simply stick with an English accent. Timothy Spall fares slightly better, but only slightly (note: see Gary Oldman for instructions on How Brits Should Do American Accents In Movies).My final reservation is more an observation than a criticism. This film is very low on traditional western-type action - if there is more than 5 minutes' worth in total during the entire film, I would be surprised. To be fair, this is probably an accurate reflection on how things were (the movie's best line features Mortensen and Harris lying wounded after a shoot-out lasting, perhaps, 15 seconds: Mortensen says "Well, that was quick," and Harris replies, "Everybody could shoot.") So this is a character-based atmosphere piece built on a traditional western framework. As I said, not a classic, but still a rewarding movie for western fans.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Basically, A for effort and D for execution</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The prospect of the film is tantalizing: Viggo Mortensen and Ed Harris, so compelling on screen together in "History of Violence", in a western film with classic style. Horses, dusty streets, shootouts, the whole thing. The story, very similar to older westerns like "Tin Star" and "Warlock", seems promising enough as well. Under Harris' listless direction and with some plot elements that practically insult the audience's intelligence, it unfortunately struck me as a very poor effort in the final analysis.Big problems in the film focus around the Renee Zellweger character who Harris' hardened mercenary Virgil Cole is infatuated with. I happen to be a big fan of Zellweger but I just did not like this character at all. She's totally worthless, and yet the film ultimately expects us to sympathize with her as a "modern" kind of portrait of a woman. It's believable that Cole trusts Everett (Mortensen) when she comes between them, but hard to understand why Everett would later manipulate events just so that Cole could end up winning the two-bit strumpet for "a while longer" or whatever it was. I basically felt like the film was substituting a cynical view of woman for an idealized one, and what I really wanted was something more what I would consider realistic. I guess I'm not as cynical about women as the people who wrote this movie. I figure there's gotta be a lot of women out there who would be better for Cole than she was, although of course Cole himself is a bit of a psycho.The whole film felt too divided, not enough focus was on any particular relationship except Cole and Everett's and that one ends up becoming relatively less important as the film goes on. Another thing that really hampers the film is Jeremy Irons, who is an excellent actor but like Zellweger has been given a rather unfortunate character. Although in the case of Irons' character, it's more just dull than objectionable for any other reason.Hate to say it, but there are hundreds of better westerns than this out there so there's not much point in it. I like the fact that they take the western genre seriously in itself, there's nothing "post-modern" or what not about this film. It's just a western story that is told in a straightforward way. But the pace is much too slow and the way the story and characters come together isn't very compelling.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>For me...it was a kind of a colossal disappointment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was in a theater in the city watching "In The Valley of Elah" (great film, see my review) when I first saw the trailer for Appaloosa. In the past few years I suddenly became a huge fan of Westerns, starting with an obsession with the coolest bad ass dude on the planet Clint Eastwood. So a new Western excited me and I loved the cast and the story looked incredible. Unfortunately I don't live in the city and had to wait a very long time before finally seeing the film. So long story short I had a lot of expectations for this Western. So that being said I found Appaloosa slow moving, under performing, and it left you always waiting for a climax that never happened. Ironically the film has most, if not all, of the necessary ingredients to be a good solid Western and it really has nothing to do with trying to be an old style film in the modern world because I, for one, love Westerns. Not all the casting was great, and the romance is awkward and really unnecessary, and the action is light. I mean the story flows alright but the time between gun fights, or action of any kind drags and doesn't really leave you satisfied.Ed Harris is an amazing actor, I've seen him do almost everything you can imagine, probably the best character actor in Hollywood and he can pull off the leading role too. In this case he takes the lead role of tough as nails, quick on the draw, street wise Virgil Cole. He also helms the film as director and I'm not sure that was the best choice for him. This is his second time at bat as director and star at the same time but still the film lacked something. Still the character of Virgil Cole is well done but after making him this tough gun fighter they quickly throw him into a romance that makes him come across as soft. Too much contradiction to the Western Hero. Viggo Mortensen, another actor I enjoy, does a great job as the equally tough, quiet, brooding, Everett Hitch. He ends up seeming tougher than Cole does. Mortensen and Harris have great chemistry as partners and their story is probably one of the more interesting in the film. Jeremy Irons plays the villain Randall Bragg, and he should be a brilliant villain but instead he s rather boring overall. This is rather surprising given Irons' talent. Renée Zellweger is perhaps the worst part of this particular cast as Harris' love interest. She just seems fake and really is never likable especially with her character arc.With really great actors like Harris, Mortensen, and Irons this should have been brilliantly acted and mind blowing which is kind of what I expected from it but instead the story dragged them all down and poor decisions in character arc made the best of the characters...poorly developed at best. I mean the film is not a total waste, it has some of the key elements needed for a Western and since we rarely see a modern day Western anymore I suppose it will have to fill the quota. Perhaps going in with less expectations might mean the film will entertain more but until then it's only sub-par in every way. 6/10</fullReview>

If it wasn't for his great acting, this movie would have been a total blow. Renee Zellweger didn't impress me, although Viggo was great as usual. Its like you cant take your eyes off the screen because its not really a boring movie. But like i said, the way they did this movie did not impress me.

		<shortDescription>Nothing Flashy Here...Just A Solid Western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is fairly humble in story and scope, and it works very well indeed. You could say that the oft told story of a fledging prairie town preyed on by the evil rancher is too predictable. Be that as it may, you will still likely enjoy this yarn due to the excellent performances of Ed Harris and Viggo Mortensen.Ed Harris is the writer/director/star of Appaloosa. Not only does he adapt and direct this western story well, his portrayal of Virgil Cole is excellent. Cole is, perhaps, the greatest living "gunman for hire". He specializes in returning lawless towns to justice. He feels he is good at what he does because he never lets feelings interfere with the work at hand. That will change and the mantle will be, more or less, passed to his faithful sidekick Everett Hitch. I'd say Harris casting is pretty "spot-on" with one exception that will be addressed shortly. Viggo Mortensen as the loyal Hitch provides the greatest surprise as he almost steals Harris' thunder in a portrayal that begs for a sequel. The casting exception may be Renee Zelweger's character Alison French. For some reason it seems she cannot fully inhabit the character as she is too needy and not dangerous enough as femme fatale type. That said, she is still the undoing of the man without feelings making the dispensing of his brand of justice quite complicated. Overall a good telling of the classic good/evil western with human complications providing twists and turns. There may be those who do not like the ending as it provides a fast resolution. I believed in it and liked it's simplicity as it fit the overall tone of the movie in a good way. Like I said...The character of Everett Hitch works so well a sequel would be nice.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Something different. . .Very good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although "Appaloosa" deals with a common theme in Westerns -- men living by strong, personal codes -- it's unusually supple, light on its feet. It's more about truth than posing. Conversations are spare, unusually penetrating at times, with flashes of humor.It is a very good Western, with people that feel very real, and good action -- but mainly it is a study of love. Between men (non-sexually), and men and women. Its look at women and love views only a narrow range, atypical of most women -- but it explores how strong insecurities can affect, and can alter love. Sometimes strangely.The cast is excellent. The principals are played by Ed Harris, who also directs, Viggo Mortensen, and Renee Zellweger, with Jeremy Irons excellent as usual in the role of the villainous rancher. He is a strong, cultivated opponent, a real person like all the others, though Renee Zellweger's character has strange components. It is a great pleasure indeed to watch these gifted actors unroll the story before us.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For any western, the movie needs to be believable, along with being realistic. Appaloosa delivers in both. It has a good story and good characters. It has good scenery and sets. It held my interest throughout, and I never said, "Oh brother". Overall it is a very good movie. Strong in all aspects. I liked it a lot. If you like westerns, you should like this one. Some people referred to it as "slow". I thought it was well paced. I think westerns are better on the "slow" side. Once Upon a Time in the West is my favorite western. I also like Dead Man, both of which could be considered "slow". Westerns are better that way. I'd go see it again. I'll be adding it to my collection.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In an age when cinematic blockbusters rule in all their special-effect laden glory, one could be forgiven for thinking that the venerable western would have gone the way of the coal-fired locomotive and vanished from the cultural landscape, however you'd be wrong, and we're all richer because of it.Appaloosa marks Hollywood's latest foray into oater territory, telling the story of lawman Virgil Cole (Ed Harris) and his shotgun toting deputy Everett Hitch (Viggo Mortensen), two hired guns enlisted as Marshalls by the town of Appaloosa, New Mexico, in order to free the hamlet from the grip of the murderous cattle baron Randall Bragg (Jeremy Irons).Working from a screenplay Harris co-wrote with Robert Knott and based upon the 2005 novel by Robert Parker, Appaloosa layers its formulaic plot with rich character detail and clever dialog in the interplay between Cole and Hitch, and Allison French (Renee Zellweger), the woman who threatens to come between them.With a running time of close to two hours, there are moments when the story seems to meander in the long gaps between gun-play, however it never quite manages to lose its grip on the audience thanks to its exploration of the bond of friendship between the grizzled and world-weary Cole and Hitch, two men not comfortable discussing or exploring their feelings.In an unusual departure from saddle-saga convention, Harris peppers the script with clever, often humorous dialog as the two men wrestle with the unfamiliar emotions of love, fear of dying, their prowess and limitations with firearms, and the reconciliation of love and betrayal. While it's true such stuff is not your conventional cowboy material, Appaloosa manages to pull it all together without making the duo come off as latter day metrosexuals. The end result is a story with two of the most endearing and interesting characters since the days when The Duke commanded the big screen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great atmospheric western with little character development</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>On the surface, Appaloosa appears to have a lot going for it. First off, Ed Harris and Viggo Mortensen have very good chemistry together and are quite believable as freelance 'peacekeepers' hired by the town of Appaloosa to reign in local bully Randall Bragg played by the very well-respected actor Jeremy Irons. Ed Harris's 'Cole' in particular reminds me of a laid-back but strong Gary Cooper from 'High Noon'. He's also got the swagger of Richard Widmark, with that violent disposition always on the verge of exploding to the surface. Viggo Mortensen's 'Hitch' is also a cool, likable character who's remarkably good with a gun.For the first half of the movie, Harris and Mortensen maintain a cool demeanor in the face of Bragg and his group of menacing bad guys. The gunfight scenes are intentionally low-key and are well-done. But as things move along, there aren't really anymore startling revelations about these characters. What you see of the two principals in the first half, is basically what you get in the second half too. Cole and Hitch simply don't develop as characters. Yes, there's the running joke where Hitch is a better word-smith than Cole and is always helping him find the right words; and there's also a little bit of conflict when Rene Zellweger's "Allie' comes between them. But that's about it. More attention is paid to the 'logistics' of the film (as Ed Harris puts it during the DVD commentary) than the characters themselves.Even worse is how the screenwriters handle the antagonist Bragg. He's supposed to be an erudite easterner who once worked with President Chester A. Arthur when he was in charge of the Port of New York's 'Custom House'. Somehow, the intellectual Bragg (who later quotes Emerson while in Cole's custody) has become the leader of a bunch of cut throats. We never learn what makes Bragg tick and eventually he loses his proactive stance and becomes Cole's prisoner on two occasions. Instead of building tension by having Bragg become more powerful, he's reduced to becoming a defanged prisoner being transported about in handcuffs.Bragg's rehabilitation at the end of the film seems a bit hasty. We're told that President Arthur pardons him and before you know it, he's back in town, is able to purchase Appaloosa's main bar/hotel and suddenly is being feted by the very citizens who wanted him dead at the beginning of the film. Why these 'upstanding' citizens would suddenly forgive the man whose men murdered an innocent townsperson and raped and murdered his wife is not explained. But it does allow the screenwriters to allow Hitch to take Bragg out at the end since the bad guy must pay for his prior transgressions.I'm not a great fan of Rene Zelwegger's acting abilities and I recognize that she is not the most attractive of Hollywood actresses. But does she really deserve the kind of reviews (replete with all kinds of misogynistic epithets) found here? In a movie such as this, it might not have been a bad idea to cast a woman who does not have 'model' looks. Do you really believe that the majority of women in the wild west were raving beauties? More likely most of them were plain like Zelwegger. Nonetheless, her part is not well-written either. Again, there's little character development. Allie's romance with Cole is more than a whirlwind romance?it basically happens in a virtual millisecond. Eventually we find out that Allie has a 'man' problem?she falls for just about any man she comes across, whether they be good, bad or ugly. In addition to that revelation, she also plays an unsteady piano and likes to flirt.Appaloosa's strong suit is the cinematography. It's shot by a master craftsman, Dean Semler, who we're told worked on this picture for "next to nothing". And I have never seen better end credit shots in my life (dig those Indian head pennies!). A great amount of attention was paid to period detail in Appaloosa. The town looks like an 1882 town but it's too clean and doesn't feel lived-in.Appaloosa has a similar plot to another recent western, "3:10 to Yuma". In both pictures, the lawmen transport a condemned prisoner who has a date on the gallows. As previously mentioned, the antagonist no longer can command his troops and the plot becomes a rather dull escape and capture potboiler. There are also a significant number of gaps in logic throughout the film. For example, when the Sheriff attempts to bring Bragg in at the beginning of the film, he only brings along two deputies and is easily shot down by the miscreants. No lawmen would walk into a situation where he could be cut down so easily. A posse of Federal troops accompanying the Sheriff would have been more believable. And how does the experienced lawman, Cole, allow his precious Allie to remain unprotected while he's busy transporting Bragg to justice? Don't you think he would have made provisions for her to hide somewhere or protected by some of his people while going about his business? Check out Ed Harris's father in real life as the Judge who finds Bragg guilty. He's a hoot; one of the best characters in the film. But the same can't be said for the ineffectual townspeople who are unable to stand up against Bragg and his band of killers. It's become a cliché to have a bunch of cowering townspeople looking for salvation from lawmen for hire. In history, the townspeople were no pushovers. Take the case of Jesse James, who almost was killed by the outraged townspeople of Northfield, Minnesota after he robbed one of their banks.Ed Harris is to be commended for making a beautiful, atmospheric film. But he should not have collaborated on the screenplay which required a more creative hand to improve a weak plot and provide more substantial character revelations.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another film that begs to be misunderstood</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yet again, I'm *not* amazed at the number of people who misunderstand a truly great film. Such is the price of subtlety and innovation.The trouble is, Appaloosa is great exactly where no one is looking. It's not *about* the shoot-outs. It's not *about* clever heroes who sling catchy one-liners. It's about a place, and a time, and a mood. About a deep, quiet friendship between two inherently un-friendly men. About the desperate love between a tough man who has very little love to give, and a woman who needs too much... and deserves none.Jeremy Irons as the 'villain' is pure McGuffin. The story simply isn't *about* him, nor the confrontation with him. It's about the nature of the two protagonists (I hesitate to say 'heroes'). The storyline rarely goes where you might expect, but the tip-off is in the climactic shoot-out, which goes nothing like that in any other western, and ends the film in a way that most viewers are very unlikely to anticipate.The brilliance of this film is in the gorgeous photography, often resembling tintype prints of the era. It's in the meticulously detailed costuming. In the atmosphere of a little frontier town. In the terse (and brilliantly under-played) conversations between Ed Harris and Viggo Mortensen. It's in a million subtleties that you'll never catch if you don't sit back, discard your preconceptions about what a 'western' should be and allow this film to wash over you.Personally, I'd say Appaloosa blows the recent 3:10 to Yuma out of the water (and that's no criticism of the latter). But it's not really a fair comparison. Appaloosa is more reminiscent of Open Range, in its use of open spaces and quiet moods - and its acute perception of how violence really happens. Beyond that, it owes little to any previous western - but, in my mind, it jumps immediately into the front ranks amongst them.I have no hesitation in giving this film a perfect 10 out of 10. Ed Harris has established his directorial abilities beyond any shadow of a doubt, and turned out not just one of the great westerns, but one of the great American films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a package of horse poop</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Robert Knott's screenplay does not do justice to Robert Parker's book, and this film is like a Department of Tourism film -- 70 mm, golden light on antique objects, with local celebrities reciting platitudes. After some interesting characterizations in the early part of the film by Ed Harris and Viggo Mortenson, the film begins to disintegrate into the distinctly unrelated sections, and all characterizations become flatter than a flitter. Lance Hendrickson, Timothy Spall, Jeremy Irons and others do good imitations of uninspired actors. Harris directed this film. He did a remarkably good job with "Riders of the Purple Sage" a few years ago, but Robert Parker is not Zane Grey. Like Knott, Harris's thespian skills were developed in Oklahoma, but they flatter themselves if they think this historical connections applies to westerns set in New Mexico Territory, let alone to Parker's revisionist craftsmanship. What really put the bow on this package of horse poop was the appearance of Oklahoma actor Rex Linn, whose chief talent is as a pitchman for car dealers and local banks.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not ever having heard about this movie I was intrigued by the title. The first 20 minutes or so did show promise and I actually was looking forward to see what would happen to the two main characters as that was clearly the most interesting relationship to observe. But then comes in Renee Zellwegger and ruins the movie. At least for me. Renee has proved that she can handle certain roles. In this movie it is obvious she is very limited. For a supposedly femme fatale she missed the essential spark,beauty or charisma to be convincing. I never expected a complicated plot with twists and turns. Or that the movie would end with a big shoot out. I did however expect some fireworks in the acting department especially in dialogs between Ed Harris and Viggo Mortensen. There simply is not much character development. Also there is not a moment that gives a proper motivation for why Ed Harris and Viggo Mortensen do the jobs they do. Overall this movie had nothing to offer me. (Would it hurt for people to make a movie like they made in the old days like "The Wild Bunch" or "The Good,The Bad and The Ugly". I am a bit tired of the so called realistic approach.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Western Rides Tall in the Saddle Again with "Appaloosa"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Westerns are rare on the big-screen these days. Hollywood cranks out fewer than a handful each year. Most are either the modern day kind like the Cohen Brothers' "No Country for Old Men" or the hybrid variety like Paul Thomas Anderson's "There Will Be Blood." Basically, westerns had worn out their welcome long before Clint Eastwood's "Unforgiven" won the Best Picture Oscar in 1992. Most westerns inherently depict white supremacy on the frontier. Sure, whites alone did not settle the old West, but Hollywood usually confined its tribute to white, Anglo-Saxon, Protestants pioneers. Indeed, as the sun began to set on the genre in the 1980s, the western found itself out of step with our multicultural society that embraced political correctness.Writer, director, &amp; actor Ed Harris' new horse opera "Appaloosa" resembles those predictable but satisfying 1950's westerns with Gary Cooper, Fred MacMurray, Randolph Scott, Joel McCrea, George Montgomery, and Rory Calhoun. This beautifully lensed law and order western dramatizes the themes of camaraderie, honor, sexual politics, and corruption. In other words, "Appaloosa" is very formal and old-fashioned. In some instances, the Robert Knott &amp; Ed Harris screenplay takes a different tack, particularly in its depiction of frontier dames. Moreover, Harris has assembled a splendid cast, including Viggo Mortensen, Renee Zellweger, Jeremy Irons, Lance Henriksen, and Timothy Spall, that looks comfortable in a 19th century setting.Seasoned lawman Virgil Cole (Ed Harris of "The Rock") and former U.S. Calvary officer Everett Hitch (Viggo Mortensen of "Hidalgo") have known each other for twelve years. Hitch narrates the movie at the beginning and talks about how that he first met Virgil and bailed him out of a scrape with his double-barreled, eight gauge shotgun. Afterward, they 'partnered up in the peacemaking' business. Since then they've made a career of taming tough towns. Everett doesn't foresee any changes. He is in for a surprise. Sure enough, unforeseen changes alter their lives. They ride into the desolate New Mexico Territory in 1882 after Virgil's good friend Marshall Jack Bell (stunt man Robert Jauregui of "Posse") and his two deputies died trying to serve warrants at the Bragg Ranch. Randall R. Bragg (Jeremy Irons of "Dead Hard with a Vengeance") rules the territory like a despot. The citizens of Appaloosa are weary of his tyranny. Bragg and his drovers have been taking anything they want without paying. They have even killed a man from Chicago and raped his wife.As the film opens, Appaloosa City Marshall Bell and his deputies ride out to Bragg's ranch. When Bell's deputies try to arrest the suspects, Bragg blows them slap out of their saddles with his Winchester before they can brandish their own six-guns. Meanwhile, the train deposits in Appaloosa an alluring widow woman, Allison French (Renee Zellweger of "Leatherheads"), who plays the piano as well as she plays with men. Virgil takes a shine to her. Eventually, one of Bragg's men, a younger cowhand, informs on his boss. Cole and Hitch sneak out to Bragg's ranch and abduct the rancher for the trial. The judge sentences Bragg to swing by the neck, and Virgil escorts him via train to the hanging. Things take a turn for the worst. Gunslinger Ring Shelton (Lance Henriksen of "Aliens") kidnaps Allison and threatens to blow her brains out if Cole doesn't release Bragg. Reluctantly, Cole capitulates, but Everett and he hit the trail after them with bloody results. Good villains make good westerns. Randall Bragg is a cold-blooded dastard from the start and cheats the hangman through an interesting turn of events."Appaloosa" qualifies as a traditional town taming tale. Virgil and Everett face the usual quota of tough-talking showdowns and sudden death shoot-outs with outlaws as well as hostile reservation jumping Apaches. The Indian encounter labels "Appaloosa" as a traditional western rather than a postmodern sagebrusher like "Dances with Wolves." On the other hand, the depiction of women is revisionist. Prostitutes win greater respect than the stereotypical good woman. "Appaloosa" lacks the score of "Silverado," looks more like "Pale Rider." Although our heroes are tall and dark, they are far from silent when they aren't swapping lead with their opponents. Not only do they engage in chummy conservations, but they also make amusing comments about the heroine and the villains. While the action is the standard fare, a clever undercurrent of humor permeates Appaloosa" and that makes it more than a typical dustraiser. Indeed, in some respects, Viggo Mortensen and Ed Harris capture the cowhide chemistry of Joel McCrea and Randolph Scott in Sam Peckinpah's immortal classic "Ride the High County." "Appaloosa" represents four-time Oscar nominee actor Ed Harris's sophomore venture behind the camera as a director; he starred in and helmed "Pollack," (2000) a biography about the famous American painter Jackson Pollack. Harris puts emphasis on period detail in "Appaloosa" and directs the action without calling attention to his technique. A moment stands out when an iron horse locomotive chugs through the arid, sun-baked territory and a large mountain cat saunters into view. The cougar sniffs the air and watches the train diminish into the distance. Indeed, it is a mere moment in time, but it conveys a wealth of atmosphere. Western fans may recall a 1964 Marlon Brando oater called "The Appaloosa" about Mexicans that stole the eponymous pony and Brando tracking them down. This "Appaloosa" has nothing to do with the venerable Brando movie. Harris and Knott drew their screenplay on Robert B. Parker's novel. Compelling dialogue, realistic situations, subtle humor, and strong performances, especially from gimlet-eyed Ed Harris, make "Appaloosa" a hypnotic horse opera.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Harris' revisionist oater is a keeper.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>APPALOOSA (2008) *** Ed Harris, Viggo Mortensen, Renee Zellweger, Jeremy Irons, Timothy Spall, James Gammon, Tom Bower, Lance Henriksen, Adriana Gil. (Dir: Ed Harris) Harris' revisionist oater is a keeper.Ed Harris has always been a fave of mine with his craggy good looks, piercing blue eyes and no-bull- attitude that barely simmers under the surface of calm neutrality. However in his latest endeavor ? and second time as director - he truly lets his attributes flex their muscles.Harris stars as Virgil Cole, who winds up taking a job as marshal for the titular hamlet back in the Old West, who, along with lifetime friend Everett Hitch (stoic man-of-few-words Mortensen) as deputy, fulfill the open position no thanks to land baron baddie Randall Bragg (Irons), whose just dispatched of the previous lawman and his deputies in cold blood by his own guns. The duo are somewhat in over their heads but both rely and depend on one another ? and more importantly - are loyal to one another, knowing each one will gladly lay his life down for the other.To add to the mix a stranger comes to the dusty town in the shapely form of Mrs. Allison French (Zellweger), practically penniless, who takes a job as the hotel pianist, and awakens Virgil's dormant romanticism. The lawman is smitten with her and courts her promptly resulting in a sudden engagement for marriage and the purchasing of a newly constructed home in the town's outskirts.As new information is discovered regarding the Bragg murders, the two friends set out to arrest the lowly killer and find themselves at an impasse when it is also shown that Mrs. French is not who she appears to be.Based on Robert B. Parker's novel, Harris - who co-adapted with Robert Knott ? had a field day as the lovesick yet tough as leather Virgil, a man who knows right from wrong but apparently has no druthers to beat a man to a pulp when his hair-triggered temper gets the best of him (in the one truly shockingly violent moment of this otherwise workmanlike Western).Mortensen is equally good as the somewhat silent but very knowledgeable right-arm to Harris' stalwart anti-hero, and their scenes together have a flinty comic brio (the two collaborated previously in David Cronenberg's A HISTORY OF VIOLENCE) and brotherly love that is clearly established to the hilt.Harris' direction is equally impressive with a fine cast of character actors sprinkled in the midst (i.e. gravel-voiced veteran Gammon and Brit Spall as the town assemblymen) and the ace cinematography by experienced lens man Dean Semler is impeccable.I only wish there was more to it in the long run; the final act feels incredibly rushed and the end scene so abrupt it almost felt as if the production had run out of film stock.Nevertheless this oater is a keeper and just seeing fine actors of Harris and Mortensen's ilk on screen makes all the difference.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Decent western derailed by a crummy subplot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I liked the main story of the movie, our heroes are lawmen for hire brought in to deal with a man who's been running roughshod over a town. The heroes have a history together and are interesting characters, the villain is a typical western baddie, crew of loyal outlaws and no conscience, the town council/owners are eastern dandy's unable to deal with the raw life of the frontier. The actions of our heroes is well done, as are the resulting confrontations although I saw a missed opportunity or two in plot execution. The thing that ruined this film was the "love interest" subplot and the fact that Cole was fool enough to keep trying to make a life with the woman even after he saw her cheat and knew she would do so again and again and again. Frankly it seemed to go against everything we knew about the character who was otherwise an intelligent if not well schooled man, who understood psychology well enough to make a crowd of 20 armed men back down. Spoiler time: Besides the repeated idiocy regarding the "romance" i feel the pardon plot point was woefully flimsy. The villain receives a pardon for all crimes committed in the county, the problem is the murders he was convicted of took place outside the sheriff's jurisdiction and thus outside the county. Overall I give this movie a "C-" its passable but could have been so much better with a little more thought and a little less forced romance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great western,,,,until Renee Zelwegger appears</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now let me preface this first by saying that I have not read the book upon which this movie was based on, nor do I know anything about it. I surely hope the book was several times better than the movie though because if I was basing my desire to read the original book upon the execution of this movie, I wouldn't want to read even one page of it.I'm not an expert when it comes to westerns so I am not going to try and compare this movie to the hundreds of westerns that have come before this. I will say though that the best "modern" western movie I have seen has been 3:10 to Yuma and this movie doesn't even compare to that one in my book.I thought the movie started out very well as I am almost always a fan of narration and I do enjoy Viggo Mortensen's acting quite a bit. The scene in the beginning of the film where Ed Harris's character comes into the saloon and basically takes care of business is my favorite part of the film by far. If you're going to "clean up a town of it's degenerates", that is the way to go and I thought it was gritty and fair all at the same time.Then Renee Zelwegger comes into the movie...and it all seems to unravel from there. In the most simplest terms, she is a complete slut, plain and simple. She's also a manipulator, which leads me to wonder if she wasn't working for Bragg (Jeremy Irons) the whole time. I don't know how her character was portrayed in the book but in the movie, her character pretty much ruined it for me.There was one part of the movie in particular that really bothered me. There was a scene where Ed Harris (Virgil Cole) tells Viggo (Everett Hitch) that the reason he isn't as good of a shooter as him is because "he has feelings." Then he goes on to say how that at that point, he is not letting his feelings dictate his actions. That was absolutely ridiculous. His feelings were the reason he was in that mess in the first place. His "feelings" for Renee Zelwegger were the reason he let his prisoner go and was in that situation in the first place. Ever since he met her, his feelings dictated every single move he made. I thought it was pathetic that a man who had lived his life being strong and not having "feelings" would be swayed so strongly by a woman who at the end of the day, only was with him because he was "there." She had sex with one of her kidnappers for crying out loud and tried to put a move on Virgil's partner! Perhaps that was the point....that he was so lonely that he was willing to sacrifice his own integrity for a woman who really didn't even love him. I can understand that, but it doesn't mean I want to watch 2 hours of that unfold on the big screen.This movie had promise but in the end just sort of limped along as if it was an actual Appaloosa (none of those horses were even in the movie by the way) that had been shot and was just trying to get home before it died.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>High Production Values Make This Mature Western A Winner</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Boy, I love it when somebody makes a classy western. You don't see many of them made today, as opposed to the "classic era age," but when you, they can be astounding, like this movie.High production values make this film a big winner. Some people went to great lengths to make sure everything looked realistic, and it shows. The sets in here are fantastic. So is the dialog. Here is another example of how you can make a western work without a lot of shoot-outs and violence. Oh, that's in here but mainly this is a dialog-driven story, which is no surprise when you realize it's from a Robert B. Parker novel. A best-selling author, Parker excels at dialog. Mostly he does he detective stories.Anyway, just listening to the two main characters talk to each other in this film, alone, makes this worthy to watch. Viggo Mortensen, as "Everett Hitch" and Ed Harris as "Virgil Cole" are just outstanding. Special kudos to Harris to directing this film (and it's well done) and being a big overall part of this production. Guys like him, Kevin Costner, Robert Duvall, Tommy Lee Jones, Sam Elliott, Tom Selleck and others have helped keep the western genre alive.Speaking of actors, it isn't just Mortensen and Harris who shine here: everyone does, from Rene Zellweger and Jeremy Irons down to the supporting cast which includes veteran actors Lance Henriksen, Timothy Spall, James Gammon, among others.If you're a fan of westerns, someone who appreciates realism and interesting characters, check this movie out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie has absolutely no story, and after 2 hours, makes no sense (minor spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So I sat for almost 2 hours and watched this movie. You would think that with an all-star cast, an Ed Harris playing in another movie that he directed that it would soar and be a great flick. CNN.com said it was one of the best movies of 2008.Trust me, after watching this movie, if you spent $20 on you and another person you are going to want a refund.The positives are that the scenery is gorgeous, the set is fairly accurate, and the actors are first rate.Unfortunately the story is weak. Without giving away too much in the way of spoilers, Ed Harris' character apparently wants revenge for the murder of a fellow colleague. And yet he is willing to be with a woman who apparently will sleep with anyone who comes across as the Alpha Male in any group. She flirts with everyone, sleeps with several men, and gives no reasoning as to why she behaves in this self destructive way.The plot surrounding Ed Harris revenge is very weak. The gun fights are over too quickly, and there is too much drivel in this story. I realize that gun fights accurately aren't going to be that long, but there is no build up in any of the action sequences. There's no explanation as to why Ed Harris would care so much as to why one particular college's death would matter so much to him; especially when he seems to eager and nonchalant about killing others.Viggo Mortensen plays the reserved, quiet, but educated partner. And yet for some reason, despite having sat through the entire movie never even raising his voice, he decides to have a gun battle with the protagonist in this movie, and rides off into the sunset.I gave the movie a 2, because at least the actors are top rate big names, and the photography is decent. But the bottom line is, you will regret paying much to watch this movie. I would wait until it is in the cheap section and you have watched all the other movies this fall and winter and are desperate for something else. Ed Harris really needs to go back to the drawing board with this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this with 2 friends in the theatre, and we were all disappointed. One cliché after another, terrible dialogue, too long. Definitely a vanity project for Harris. I stayed to the very end to see who was singing the song for closing credits (Tom Petty) and then I hear another song with a familiar voice - it's Ed Harris! I knew it was him before I saw the credits! He can't sing. If that isn't a sure sign of a VP I don't know what is.Terrible dialogue "I've known you a long time...as long as you've known me..." was actually repeated twice!There was one good line, after a good "shoot 'em up" Everett says something like "that happened fast" to which Virgil replies, "that's cause everybody could shoot."I agree with most of the other comments- it kind of went off the rails when Zellweger came into the picture.Might be okay at home on DVD. 3:10 to Yuma was better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Appaloosa" is a form of new-wave western that centers on a simple plot but with plenty of twists along the way. The story is simple but the acting is spot on. The connection between Ed and Viggo is unique, their friendship being on of the most enjoyable parts of the film. The setting is basic, but beautiful, and the villain, Jeremy Irons, is spot on (he seems to always play a good villain, except for "Dungeons and Dragons"). There really is no reason to hate this movie, but some aspects of the film lead to some negative opinions. For instance, Renée Zellweger's character was really, really unlikeable (in my opinion). Another is the storyline which seemed to jump from character to character with no sense of time and the love triangle within the story can be irritating to the viewer. This film has its moments and issues but other then that "Appaloosa" is a basic western brought to the younger audience to spark a new interest in the old genre.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Appaloosa is the story of 2 men, Virgil Cole(Ed Harris) and Everett Hitch(Viggo Mortensen) who travel the territories of the Old West as lawmen hired to tame lawless towns. Arriving in Appaloosa they are tasked with bringing down a ruthless cattle baron Randall Bragg (Jeremy Irons) who is accused of murdering the towns last Marshall and letting his crew of cowboys run wild and create havoc at the expense of its people. While doing their job Virgil meets the newly arrived single woman, Ms. French (Renee Zelwegger) who he is immediately smitten with. She seems to return his affection but she seems to have a love for other men as well, when left without his company for any length of time, even his partner.With the cast that this movie showcases you would immediately think this one should be a classic. Don't get your hopes up too high. This is a movie that does have some appeal, but if your looking for an Old West, exciting shootout adventure, watch "3:10 to Yuma" instead.As far as a period piece goes, this one may be pretty authentic. The language used seems to fit the time period, the drama is just OK, and it feels as if it is well done as far as real western life goes. The characters were fairly well acted but the writing was done in such a bad way that other than giving up a small line or two about their pasts, it never really gives you any reasons to truly care about any of the characters.. The problem I had was that it seemed to spend too much effort in building up a realistic study instead of providing us with any kind of real action that the genre usually is known for. I felt the same way about the Clint Eastwood directed ,"The Unforgiven," but that one at least built us to a great action sequence ending that made all the build up worth it, where as this film's ending was underwhelming at best. I am all for a good drama but with a western, especially one portraying a couple of mercenary lawmen, you really need to bring it in gunfight scenes even if there are only going to be a few. In this one those scenes are over in the blink of an eye.The "lawlessness" of the town isn't even illustrated well enough to make you hate the anti-hero and his men other then a couple of rather pedestrian scenes that made for some promise that was never delivered. In the end "Appaloosa" was weakly written, not fully developed, and lacks the excitement that makes sitting through the dry dialog worth it in the end. It's a case of wasting too much on authenticity and not enough on entertaining the viewer. I like a movie that gets the time period specifics right, but if that is all there is, I really don't want to watch it. If I want that I can watch the History Channel instead.Like my reviews, hate em?

		<shortDescription>Impressive directorial effort from Ed Harris, with careful attention to a number of raw items given their respective dues.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Appaloosa is a really interesting, really engaging western, a part redemptive text; part love story; part homo-erotic tale, about two men whom come together after a one-time brash bout of masculinity and party up to take on the world, and part causality driven chase flick. The film, directed by one of its stars in Ed Harris, focuses on the two leads and their relationship which very gradually comes apart in a mature and methodical manner, an event of which happens out of the involvement with a woman in a town from which the film garners its title. Appaloosa is a wondrous snapshot of the lives and times of various people becoming unstuck in relation to their old ways, as well as the usual manners in which attitudes towards life are embedded; a fascinating character study with rich attention to supporting acts whom come to affect the protagonists. It is quite the absorbing western.The piece is narrated to us from the future by a certain wondering gun slinger named Everett Hitch, played by Viggo Mortensen. His tones are dry and hushed, even rueful. He speaks of his friend Virgil Cole (Harris), another free spirited gentleman whom he aided in dealing with a bar room brawl some years ago and has since been travelling with ever since; flitting from place to place and helping out where necessary. Their journeying is accompanied by long shots of dry scenery as well as expansive hills and mountains; the current state of play established, the order of their lives and what exactly their lives entail got across, and this is all before they stumble across the town of Appaloosa: a locale in which these two men's lives will greatly change. Appaloosa is the sort of film that relies on its great levels of drama in a reaction or a singular expression, Hitch's gazing at both Cole and French whilst overlooking an inmate in a jail house is telling; his reaction to the news they are later to move into a house that's being constructed particularly telling. To be sure, there is action and reaction involving conflict and a stone-wall villain in Bragg but the film is effectively about what happens to Cole and Hitch in this titular town of Appaloosa; the fear of loosing more than a dear friend, a partner, to somebody else and the fear of facing the big, wide, aggressive world of the Wild West alone with heavy envy hanging over you.The town of Appaloosa exists in a grip of terror instigated by outlaw Randall Bragg (Irons, complete with wavering accent); a rough, ready and sadistic man with an equally rough, ready and sadistic posse of men whom follow him. The lawmen running this town are shot and killed very early on, the attitude towards law enforcement effectively put across and all Hell threatens to break loose therein. Cole and Hitch arrive, the town's officials more than eager to hire them in dealing with the issue: even if it means handing over more power than is desired; with the two men wasting little time in sorting out two of Bragg's cohorts that cross them. Later on, Cole will clash with Bragg in profile as they sit opposite one another in a local café in an uneasy truce; back up for both sides also occupying the room and a real sense of conflict apparent. Running parallel to this strand is another involving Renée Zellweger's character, a recently widowed woman named Allison French whom Cole strikes up a fondness for, and it is here the trouble for Hitch really begins.The film is first and foremost Mortensen's with what's principally at stake the threat of being alone and not at one with the man any longer, looming. The plot involving Bragg and that feud, which later comes to cover the extradition plus trek all over the dangerous rural plains of nowhere, amply supports what is a story about a man having to come to terms with change. Much is spoken about Cole's past instances with other women and the life of love he led, namely, that he has sparsely even known another woman and relationships are alien to him. We get the feeling Cole and Hitch have been doing what they do, with both persistent and routine occurrence as well as calculated efficiency, for a good while through the exact manner in which they appear to tackle the problem of Bragg and his thugs. Later, we are weary of how the two of them stumble in their speaking to one another about Allison; pauses and beats in the conversation when she's mentioned to have asked after Cole that lead to more heated discussions. Up to this point, and we assure ourselves further back in time, easy back-and-fourths as well as the falling back into the proverbial arms of one another was the norm; one scene highlighting the characteristics of aid and honour Hitch has for Cole evident in the sequence he cools a situation down following Cole's drunkard picking of a fight. Cole himself even I.D.'s Hitch as being a man whom "completes my sentences for me" and that intense affair they have with one another feels both prominent before it is threatened.Eagle eyed viewers will notice the casting, that of which is directly comparable to Cronenberg's 2005 film A History of Violence; Appaloosa the film maybe resembling what Mortensen and Harris' characters from said film might've been like in their working together prior to their falling out if their overall morals were of polar opposites to what they are here. It's to the film's great credit we recall such an incidence just the once, feverishly resisting the temptation to hark back and long for what the viewer may perceive as a better film covering more interesting ground with corresponding casting decisions. Even sharper viewers will spot the thematic and narrative resemblances to Edward Dmytryk's 1959 film Warlock, and while this isn't as good, it more than suffices.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a bad movie...but Renee Zellweger cannot act at all...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This overall movie is not terrible. It has a decent story and is fairly well done, although it has places where it drags and could be a bit shorter (or snappier). Ed Harris is not great as a western character, but Viggo Mortensen is quite good. The biggest problem with this movie is Zellweger. She apparently cannot act at all. I do not know if it was because it was a western or what, but she was awful. Every single line seemed trite, forced and fake. She seemed to be trying very hard to seem "damselly." I am sure that some of it was the character that they wrote for her. But she could still have chosen to play it less like a dimwit, seemingly fainting from exhaustion with every sickly sweet line she delivered.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Is love worth dying over?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's good to see that at least a few decent Westerns are still being made. In the sea of sequels, remakes, comic book and video game movies, a film like this is very refreshing. Appaloosa is mostly an Ed Harris project as he writes, directs, and stars as a lawman for hire out to free a town from the clutches of an unscrupulous land owner. The film is sparsely narrated by his sidekick played by Viggo Mortensen. The two gunslingers are a handful for anyone who dares mess with them, and it isn't long before they have the landowner, played by Jeremy Irons, on the ropes and headed for the gallows. It is then when Harris's love for a newly arrived woman (Zellweger) threatens to ruin everything.When Rene Zellweger bursts onto the scene one bright day, both Harris and Mortensen seem spellbound by her. I've never been a huge fan of either this woman's beauty or acting ability, but here she does just fine. Especially since there don't appear to be any women in town who aren't either schoolmarms or prostitutes. Zellweger ends up on Harris's arm, probably since he's the town Marshal, and Mortensen is just his deputy. But on one occasion, we see her make a move on the younger man as well. And as further events separate her from Harris for a spell, we find out that her character will pretty much bed down with the nearest alpha-male no matter who he is. Through it all, and through many gunfights and double-crossings, Harris cannot bring himself to stop loving this woman. Even as it is clearly putting his life and profession on the line.Overall this is a good film, but not a great Western. The first hour and a half play out fairly well, but the story seems to lose its way a bit toward the conclusion. The film does not depend so much on action like the recent update of 3:10 to Yuma did. And it isn't quite as downbeat and introspective as a Heaven's Gate. Harris is just getting his feet under himself as a filmmaker, after such a terrific career as just an actor. Another ten years or so he may be making some gems like Eastwood does to this day. That may in fact be his plan..... 8 of 10 stars.The Hound.</fullReview>

This movie is one of those movies you hardly hear about because it's not polluted by shiny stars and cheap sales tricks. It is slow and patient and deadly strict to the totally logic plot. It could have been a movie from the Cohen-brothers. I loved it, Everett (excellently portraited by ViggoMortensen) simply being my kind of man. The movie is an absolute must for people yawning by movies with the constantly annoying appearance of cocky heroes who never hesitates or wonders what's right or wrong, and where the bad guy is simply to stupid to have even survived puberty.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Anyone else remember the theme from "The Virginian"?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really enjoyed Appaloosa, but my ear got stuck on Jeff Beal's theme music, then I remembered - "The Virginian"! The 1960s TV show, I mean. You can find an episode on YouTube and verify my observation. I didn't feel that the theme music was bad, per se, just that it is OBVIOUSLY derivative - oh, I mean an homage - to the music of The Virginian, by Ennio Morricone. The problem that arises with such a similar theme is that regardless of how good it might be, it does not match the original, and so one perceives that it is off-key or poorly played.The only other thing that dampened my enthusiasm for Appaloosa just a bit was Renée Zellweger as the irresistible new hot chick in town. Really? I mean, REALLY?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really enjoyed Appaloosa but not as much as I had hoped. These days it is hard to find a good western or any western being made for that matter. Open Range was the last western to come out that I really enjoyed. The trailers for Appaloosa had me excited that Ed Harris was making a western and re-teaming with Viggo Mortensen after A History of Violence. I felt the writing in this movie was very witty and often times laugh out loud funny. All the actors did respectable jobs and it was nice to see Lance Henriksen in a mainstream movie and not some made for t.v. sci-fi original! The plot was about average but could have used more time for some back story and character development. Most of the story of the movie was just told as this is what it is and no reasons as to why? Jeremy Irons who was extremely underused in my opinion was the bad guy because the movie said so and he kills some people in the beginning.I don't like movies that are long just to be long or to try and set themselves away from the pack but I love long movies if the time is used to enhance the plot and characters. I don't believe it was more than a walkthrough for most of the actors involved which is a shame because they have all done such great work in other films. I don't care much for Renee Zellweger (sp?) and would really have liked to seen another actress in her place. Overall it was an enjoyable movie and if you like westerns catch this one at a matinée or if you are lucky enough to have a dollar theater in your town as I do that would be ideal.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very uninterestingly done western.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A good new age western is a rare thing, which is also a reason why not too many of them get made now days. Ed Harris tried but also he failed with this movie.Ed Harris directed, wrote, produced and acted in this movie. So you really could say that this was his project and it also does really feel like his own personal project, which in this case isn't really a positive thing to say. It's like he woke up one day and said to himself; 'I really want to do a western!' and threw about every cliché thinkable in to a script and called a couple of his Hollywood friends to ask to help him out with making this movie. This movie really doesn't feel like one that would had been made and released in theaters if it didn't had Ed Harris his name and that of others attached to it already.One of the things with this movie is that it really isn't a very interesting one. First of all, the characters really aren't much interesting or likable enough, despite of all of the fine actors portraying them. But the story itself also feels far too simplistic. It makes some very sudden jumps and the movie just never seems able to find its right pace.Like basically every western it picks a slow pace but this can only work if your characters are still solid and likable enough to carry your movie. In this movie that obviously isn't the case. It also really hasn't got the right story and setup for that kind of approach. The story actually asked for a far faster pace, with also more action in it. That way the movie would at least had been somewhat more entertaining to watch.The characters don't really work out on their own but also really not with each other. I can't really see being Ed Harris and Viggo Mortensen being friends for life and always ride and stick together everywhere, no matter what. But also the whole love angle with the Ed Harris and Renée Zellweger character works far from convincing. And what ever happened to Renée Zellweger's career by the way? Her picks of movies has been pretty poorly the last couple of years.Also a real shame how they treat Jeremy Irons in this movie. When you have Jeremy Irons as the villain for your movie, you need to give him far more interesting and good things to do. Make him more evil. Let the audience hate him! That way the audience might had also cheered more for the 'good' guys Ed Harris and Viggo Mortensen. Now it instead feels like a very shallow and disjointed movie, with a shallow story and shallow characters in it. The movie is really lacking the right depth and emotions that are needed for this type of western.Only thing that still keeps things going and prevent it from being a complete disaster are its actors. Man, I really can't imaging how badly I would had hated this movie if it had a couple of unknown and bad actors in it. Even though none of the characters really work out, the performance by most of the actors are still fine. So you could instead really blame the writing but also really the very bland, inexperienced, lacking directing from Ed Harris for making this movie and its characters not work out as they were supposed to.5/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Much like the Robert B. Parker novel on which this film is based, director Ed Harris has fashioned a minimalist masterpiece.Great photography and tremendous attention to detail contribute to a brisk story of violence and revenge in Arizona. It was refreshing to see the gunfights staged in a realistic manner. No endless shots of the shooters hands and eyes prior to pulling the trigger, and no firearms that sound like small artillery cannons.Ed Harris and Viggo Mortensen speak volumes with their silence in many of the scenes. The viewer is well aware that these two have a history of trust. Jeremy Irons is pure evil as the typical villain wanting to own the town. It was also a pleasure to see James Gammon in a supporting role as Earl May, one of the town fathers.Renee Zellweger is appropriately annoying as Allie French, much like the character in the book. She is the only person who can distract Virgil Cole. There was no need to detail her bad cooking and poor piano playing from the novel. The unspoken visuals between the two actors conveyed their story easily.Appaloosa is a fine western and terrific alternative to the usual shoot 'em up stories we often see. There are three more Virgil Cole novels from the late Robert B. Parker, and here's to seeing another film from this talented crew.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The real old west as seen by Hollywood is far from the glamorous saloons and pretty dance hall girls. The old west was also far from the mystical gunslingers and flashy lawmen who's reputations were the basis for the legends which spawn their heroics. Indeed, this movie " Appaloosa " which is not to be confused with the Marlan Brando version, is perhaps the best western film since Eastwood's Unforgiven. The story is taken from the frontier pages of the Robert Parker novel and is very much a solid story come to life. Ed Harris plays Virgil Cole, a no nonsense officer of the law hired as city Marshal of the town by the same name. Everett Hitch is his loyal and steadfast deputy Viggo Mortensen. Together this experienced team arrives in town to keep the peace and bring order to the territory. As such they are confronted by the arrogant cowhands, bragging gun hands, the rich, powerful and very influential rancher Randall Bragg (Jeremy Irons). The movie is realistic and dark, not in a morbid sense, but in a very dusty, gritty formate reminiscent of the Real old west as described in authentic history books of New Mexico in the 1880's.This movie as directed by Ed Harris is to say the least honest in that, the law doesn't alway win, judges are not without a price and their women (Renée Zellweger) as Allison French are as practical as the west created them. Excellent fare. ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ed Harris Sticks to Tradition with This Modest Western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pretty much the definition of a solid "B" effort."Appaloosa" was clearly Ed Harris's baby, as he directed, co-produced, co-wrote, and starred in it, as well as sang the song that plays over the end credits! Given that, I'd love to report that I thought the film was a masterpiece, but it's far from that. It's a competent, standard western, feet planted squarely within the conventions of the genre.Ed Harris and Viggo Mortensen play Virgil Cole and Everett Hitch, the sheriff and deputy, respectively, of a wild west town, hired to protect its citizens from the deadly bullying of a band of outlaws, led by Randall Bragg (a miscast Jeremy Irons, who can't quite successfully lose his British accent). Like many westerns, the principal theme of the film revolves around male solidarity; Virgil and Everett are so good at what they do because each is closer to the other than either is to anyone else. That "anyone else" includes Allison French, played by Renee Zellweger, looking even more pinched than usual, a lone woman who arrives in the town and hooks up with Virgil. For a while after her arrival, the screenplay flirts around with a love triangle, but it wisely drops that idea and avoids the predictable. It instead stays focused on Virgil and Everett and their quest to bring Bragg to justice, even after he's become a wealthy businessman and won the town's admiration.My biggest problem with "Appaloosa" was its lack of a point of view. Everett begins the film with a voice over narration explaining how he came to know Virgil and hitch his saddle to him, and the film's climax circles back to focus on him again, but throughout the middle part of the film he's treated like a secondary character and I forgot that the film started with his point of view. Mortensen does give the film's best performance, however, followed closely by Harris. Harris's performance might have resonated more if the character of Virgil had been better written. I thought the screenplay was going in an interesting direction with him at one point, in a scene where he abuses his authority, and suggested that the film might examine the fine line that separates Virgil from being as bad as the villains from whom he's protecting the town, but nothing comes of it. And Zellweger's character exists for plot purposes only. I couldn't really make sense of Ally French at all.An admirable effort that continues the mini western revival Hollywood has been enjoying lately that began last year with "The Assassination of Jesse James" and "3:10 to Yuma," but "Appaloosa" isn't anywhere nearly as fascinating as the first film or as wildly entertaining as the second.Grade: B</fullReview>

"I'm here to take the men" "You can't have them" "I'm taking them" bang bang bang. That was it but dragged out for a lot longer.And that was the problem with the rest of the film.

		<shortDescription>An excellent character study set in a Western.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So maybe lots of the people who post negative comments are hard of hearing as well as somewhat illiterate... what's not to get, folks? Start here: Renée Zellweger's character didn't sleep with any male with a pulse, she only slept with the current alpha male. In any given situation. She's a widow, broke, scared and desperate (she arrives in town with $1!) in the Old West in 1882. Doesn't mean I sympathize with her, but it's understandable, at least. Ms. Zellweger always looks to me like she's sucking on a lemon, so I think they could have picked a better-looking woman for Cole to fall for, but everything is explained if you pay attention to the film. ("She's so clean!")The relationship of Virgil and Everett is the key to the film, not the bad guy or the gunfights, or the Apaches.They've been partners for 12 years or so. They don't even have to talk to one another to know what the other's thinking until Allie enters the picture. Cole is not getting any younger. He has no female figures for comparison except "whores and that Indian woman." He can settle down, in a job he knows how to handle, with his companionship issues resolved, and in his own house. He's taking care of #1, people... and he's always thought of Everett as secondary but necessary. But if he settles down, he won't need Everett. Everett sees this coming. He knows Cole even when Cole doesn't know himself.(SPOILER)*******He kills Bragg to PROTECT Cole. It's his last submissive gesture. All he asks in return is that Cole not prosecute him for it, to let him literally ride off into the sunset. The characters are typical Robert B. Parker strong silent types (think, to a degree, Spenser and Hawk).I think maybe some of the nay-sayers on this film are too young and inexperienced (not to mention untutored) to "get it"... which is okay. Nobody *has* to like ANYTHING... but it's an issue when your comments indicate that your dislike is anything more meaningful than a personal choice or opinion. Not the best Western I've seen (not even the best Parker adaptation), but Mortenson, Harris and Irons really make this work. (Not so Ms. Zellweger, unfortunately.) Oh, and real gunfights probably were that abrupt and quick, and maybe the pace was too slow for the ADD generation. It wasn't meant to be another "Quick And The Dead."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fimally--A Real Western For Western Fans!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In my opinion as a huge fan of Westerns, this is the greatest Western since the "Tombstone"/"Unforgiven" era of the early 90s. It's not preaching, trying to be philosophical, or pandering to make this palatable to the masses of Hollywood fans who enjoy the latest Adam Sandler junk, happily-ever-afters, and stupid movies about talking dogs.It has all the essentials of a great Western--1) Fantastic dry/dirt/dusty towns and scenic backdrops, 2) A good guy who has serious personality quirks and isn't always so good, 3) A lilly-livered bad guy who is highly intelligent, 4) A woman who is a little suspect, 4) An ending that's not happy or unhappy. It also follows what all good Western plots are SUPPOSED to be: "Bad guy does something *really* bad, good guy(s) show up in town, good guys drive bad guy's posse from town, bad guy tries to fight back, showdown, bad guy gets his come-uppins. THE END." That's all a Western's supposed to be. Why mess with the formula?The last two big Westerns--"Brokeback Mountain" and "3:10 to Yuma", may be loved by the general populace but seriously miss the mark to most true Western fans. "3:10" is just philosophy all over the place with the talkiest villain ever--Eastwood's Man-With-No-Name would have shot the prisoner just to shut him up.The acting in "Appaloosa" is superb all the way around--no need to list all the names because they all did a great job.Lastly, it was fantastic to see Ed Harris is a wide-brimmed black hat again--slightly reprising his role from "Walker" (1987). I think Harris should have done far more Westerns in his career because he delivers us a damn fine character.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Two Gunmen - or Lawmen as they would prefer to be called - are hired to police a little town in New Mexico called Appaloosa. They accept to defend the town against BRAGG and his men (expertly played by Jeremy Irons) and have to deal with his gang and several other unsavory characters. Throw a gorgeous widow/whore in the equation who turns out to become the love interest of the MARSHAL (with one L!!!). A terrific script matches solid well-tuned performances, a well-chosen cast, location filming in Texas by Oscar-winner DEAN SEMLER (of Dances With Wolves) and the incredibly controlled, sure-footed direction by Ed Harris make this one of the best Westerns of the recent two decades. The climactic shoot-out is a stand-out in a uniformly gripping and riveting winner by second-time director Harris. He's one of the most underrated actor/directors in Hollywood. My favorite scene: Allie running to get Virgil after the shootout with Shelton brothers and that unforgettable fadeout! The chemistry and understanding between the two men and their mutual respect for one another is simply a Western treat! Jeff Beal's rousing score is another consolidating asset. If you love Westerns, definitely catch this one!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Such a Movie and not a Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is such a movie and not a film. I say that because, as the modern day western progresses in front of us, certain films have set a standard in terms of reality and what we expect.Basically... the American audience receives and education at the movies whether they are conscious of it our not. Having that been said, it's not a good idea to make a movie that goes against the education that we've received in the genre of the American western.Appaloosa does just that.I have to blame the DP (director of photography) Dean Semler. The lighting was too obvious and there was too much use of wide angle lenses.The set and art direction bothered me as well... I just felt like I was watching actors on a set and I not could believe this movie.The actors actually had a good script and did a decent job, but the production failed this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>but I watched this movie because of Ed Harris and Jeremy Irons. I kept hoping that between the two of them, this would be the movie that got me to be a fan of Westerns. I was sorely disappointed.Here's a breakdown of the movie. Bad guy shoots law man. Good guys show up in town. Two hours later good guys shoot bad guy. The End. There is nothing in between worth mentioning. There is no character development. There is no thought provoking dialogue. There is no moral to the story. There is no point to the movie.I suspect that die hard western fans will absolutely love this movie. I think everyone else will be frustrated that Ed Harris and Jeremy Irons were involved in this tripe.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I began watching this movie with high expectations. After all, this is Ed Harris. Vigo Mortensen. Renee Zellweger. Jeremy Irons. With a stellar cast like this, how could the movie go so wrong? Beginning with the terrible voice-over done by Vigo, it goes from bad to worse. The sets look like old-school '50s westerns, lacking authenticity. Compare sets used in movies such as "Unforgiven", "Pale Rider", and "Deadwood." Harris could have created a "nostalgic" style of Western without re-creating the silly sets, and then adding the obtrusive music on top of it.Now we get to the awful dialog. None of it was believable, much less authentic. Harris' dialog was okay, but the rest of it? Silly. I laughed throughout this movie. Even the characters' mannerisms were untrue to the period. Ways of addressing each other, social customs of the period - all were ignored. The rambling, pointless plot deserves mention as well. We're given no real information as to how the town villain suddenly became town council's best pal. His men had killed a man and raped his wife? This was the whole pretext to the story; this was why the three lawmen in the opening scene were killed. Harris and Mortensen were called in to bring Irons and his henchmen to heel. A pardon erased all the bad feelings and nasty behavior of the villains? Then he suddenly has the most popular saloon in town. Magically, out of the ether, he's no longer a cattle rancher, killer, and obnoxious villain?Very little of the plot makes any sense at all. And from here, it wanders through a pointless series of incidents until the anti-climax of the supposed showdown. We're given a final poke in the eye at the end with a nonsensical Vigo Mortensen voice-over, worse than the opener.Good god, I wanted to be one of the sheriff's men in the opening scene so that I could have hit the dirt face-first and avoided wasting two hours of my time on this turkey.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Solid Western Like in the Old Times?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The tough friends and partners Virgil Cole (Ed Harris) and Everett Hitch (Viggo Mortensen) arrive in the town of Appaloosa and they are hired as marshal and deputy by the local politicians with absolute power to rule the city. In their first assignment, they face the gang of the powerful rancher Randall Bragg (Jeremy Irons), who had killed Marshall Jack Bell (Bobby Jauregui) and his two deputies, and they kill three gunmen. When the refined piano player Allison French (Renée Zellweger) arrives in Appaloosa, she stays close to the needy Virgil and they decide to live together. Meanwhile one employee of Bragg offers to testify against his boss and Virgil and Everett bring him to court, where he is sentenced to death by hanging. While transporting Bragg in the train to be executed, two gunmen abduct Allie to force Virgil to release the criminal. Bragg escapes with his men and Allie through the desert, with Virgil and Everett on their tail."Appaloosa" is a solid western with a style of those Clint Eastwood's movies in the beginning of his career. The story of loyalty, friendship and power has a key element performed by Renée Zellweger ? a woman refined, clean, that speaks well and plays piano ? that is not a whore, but voluble and attracted by dominant leaders in her community. Her complex character is quite unusual and ambiguous, and Renée Zellweger gives a fine performance disturbing the relationship between Virgil and Everett. Virgil trying to describe his feelings for Allie to Everett is fantastic and makes easy to the viewer to understand why he decides to settle down in Appaloosa and move in together with Allie. Ed Harris, Viggo Mortensen and Jeremy Irons are magnificent. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): "Appaloosa ? Uma Cidade Sem Lei" ("Appaloosa ? A City Without Law")</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good, solid film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was an enjoyable Western for both my husband and myself, but particularly for him as he especially likes the books of Robert Parker. He was impressed with the fidelity of the movie to the book and liked the scenery and acting. I thought it was a pretty good film, but was not as impressed with Ed Harris's acting for the most part as much as I expected to be. I kept "seeing" him step back into scenes after setting them up as director, or conferring with someone on the script. Jeremy Irons was surprising in a Western, and suitably villainous but complex as well. I thought Viggo Mortensen was perfect in his role, and quite low-key but strong. There were subtle undercurrents in his acting that made me think of "Brokeback Mountain." We both felt that Renee Zellweger did an adequate job, but was also a bit troubling in the role. Like was she really up to it? We both decided we were trying during the film to think of who else could have played this role? I thought of Diane Lane right off. We would see the film again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ed Harris and Viggo Mortensen are cleaning up the town of Appaloosa under the thumb of Jeremy Irons</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Appaloosa" is a New Mexican town in 1882. It's under the thumb of an urbane but murderous rancher, Jeremy Irons. The town's leaders hire lawmen Ed Harris and Viggo Mortensen to counter Irons. It's very much like hiring the Earps to enforce a no gun policy in Tombstone. In fact, Ed Harris's character has the name Virgil, an echo of Wyatt's brother. Harris sits in front of his office in the same leisurely way that Fonda did in "My Darling Clementine".The story, however, is very different, even if the basic conflict is the same. Mortensen is much closer to Harris than Doc Holliday was to Wyatt Earp. They are in most scenes together. Their relationship and interplay counts for a lot in this movie, and it's heightened when a woman comes to town that Harris likes a lot."Appaloosa" was a labor of love for Harris, and he scored. It's a beautifully done western, an instantaneous adult western classic because Harris made it in the classic style and filled it with classic content. The characters are deep and on the iconic bigger than life side, but they are at the same time very human, with real strengths and weaknesses.It's not as if we are in an obvious way seeing all that much that is new in such a movie's plot, but yet we are seeing something new. We see here new characters who make an impression. The loyalty and rapport of Harris and Mortensen, the almost child-like joy of Harris with the woman played by Renee Zellwager, her insecurity, the conniving of Irons, and the cool and experienced courage of using the gun -- all of these make an impression. And one thing more, the beauty of the locations and a good many of the staged shots. It's not earth-shaking scenery for the most part, and yet the shots are so well composed that they make the viewing very attractive and satisfying.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After reading several reviews on IMDb and being Ed Harris fans anyway, we decided to give it a try. We never watch new movies live, always recorded, so that we can scrap them if they are not to our liking. It was easy to see this would be good from the obvious production quality early on and we're not western fans but we had a feeling about this one. The day after we watched it, we again read some but not all of the reviews on this web-site. Some mentioned "moments of humor" or possible under or over-playing of some roles. But we didn't have time to read far enough to locate at least one or two reviews which revealed that this was the Black Comedy of the century. This was the greatest tongue-in-cheek spoof on westerns in the history of movies. If the normal shooting time on a movie of this length and complexity is three weeks, this one took an extra week of "cuts" for the cast to recover from complete break-ups over the fine-line comedy they were filming. Possibly the best Black Comedy ever, just in the way it walked a tightrope in disguising itself as something else to all viewers except those who truly appreciate and understand this art form.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Never ain't here yet".</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Appaloosa" was in and out of theaters before you knew it, and that's a shame. But at least it made it. "The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford" was never even shown in a single theater in my area. I thought about that a long while but could never figure out why. Oh well.Since Unforgiven's Best Picture Oscar win in 1992, the Western film has been generally under-represented. It's as if whatever Western is made, it better be an excellent film, or it just might be the last. Fortunately, at least for my taste, every one I've seen newly released since then has met that standard, including "Appaloosa". What's interesting here were the principal players. You don't think of Ed Harris as a Western actor, although he's appeared in a few, and even though Viggo Mortensen raced horseback in "Hidalgo", it also seemed out of character for him to play a cowboy. I think they made a convincing duo here, with Everett Hitch (Mortensen) skillfully backing Virgil Cole's (Harris) play every step of the way. It's a story related somewhat through the eyes of Mortensen's character, as his voice-over bookends the story, somewhat lamenting the passing of an era.The presence of Renee Zellweger's character is a bit of an anomaly, in that she becomes romantically involved with Virgil Cole. The relationship gets tricky here though, because Allsion French (Zellweger) isn't what she appears to be on the surface. She compromises her loyalty to Cole almost immediately with a come-on to Hitch, and then crosses the line with Ring Shelton (Lance Henricksen). Her own shallowness in desiring to be with the top hand, the boss stallion as it were, is dealt with during the campfire chat when Cole takes Everett's word over 'the incident'. This was a great way to explore the theme of honor between partners, assuring us that the bond between Cole and Hitch could not be broken by a woman who got in the way.For all that, Virgil Cole also understands that his partner is not in the same league with him in terms of dealing with absolutes. In a revealing conversation, Cole verbalizes why Hitch isn't as good as him, or even the Shelton boys. It's because Hitch has feelings, and as Cole has observed in his career - "Feelings get you killed". So if you follow that thread, you get to understand Hitch's motivation at the end of the picture when he challenges Bragg (Jeremy Irons). Bragg killed a friend of Cole's, and he wasn't going to get away with it, Presidential pardon or no. It was fitting that Hitch closed out the story instead of Cole, bringing the focus back on his character and how he evolved in his relationship to Cole over the course of the picture.I have to mention this, something I remember from my theater viewing of the film when it came out. The one scene that got a response from the crowd was the showdown at the jail when Cole and Hitch faced off against the Shelton's and Bragg. It was Cole's analysis of the gunfight which left both of them severely wounded - "Everybody could shoot". I was surprised at the reaction, the audience was obviously into the moment and thought it a clever line.So if I mention "Unforgiven" earlier in the same review, it's with some idea of drawing a comparison, and though I think the Eastwood film is a notch better, especially as a revenge story, this one also serves well. And one more thing. Remember the scene of the train carrying Bragg off to Yaqui Prison right after he was found guilty of killing Jack Bell? Watching the scene from a raised vantage point was a mountain lion, and that didn't just happen. It had to be someone's idea to place that mountain lion in the picture, and for that, I have to award a bonus point.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Scattershot western, worth watching for some electric performances</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Though it contains a number of great sequences, "Appaloosa" is ultimately a mediocre Western about two New Mexico lawmen and the woman who comes between them. Ed Harris and Viggo Mortensen play our heroes, but the plot, which involves our duo hiring themselves out to towns overrun by bad guys (why is the chief villain always played by a British actor?), is tired stuff.Still, Harris and Mortensen create a couple of unforgettable characters here. Harris is a mean tempered brute obsessed with learning fancy words in an effort to refine himself, while Mortensen is stoic and observant, always looking out for his wingman. They're a great pair, and deserve to be in a better film.If "Appaloosa" is overlong and poorly paced, it nevertheless closes with a beautiful scene, Mortensen (who delivers some fine facial acting throughout the film; watch how he works his chin and moustache) sacrificing himself for his buddy and riding off into the sunset. The duo have great chemistry. Somebody please cast them in another western.7.9/10 ? Some modern westerns worth seeking out: "Open Range", "Tombstone", "Unforgiven", "Wild Bill", "Bad Company", "Wild Bill", "The Claim", "The Proposition", "The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada" and "The Long Riders". Otherwise, watch the golden age or revisionist classics.Worth one viewing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Awesome Appaloosa</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wow!!!!! I have to say this was a surprise. On the face of things Appaloosa looks like a fairly mediocre western, with two actors that many people have forgotten. Viggo Mortensen is mostly remembered for his Lord of the Rings performance and Ed Harris...has he done anything recently? Yet Appaloosa shows us just why they were chosen for all the films they've been in. They are excellent. Ed Harris plays Virgil Cole like he was born to play the role. The way that he guns down Braggs men in the bar is fabulous, Clint Eastwood is put to shame by the way he pulls his gun. And when Cole and Hitch advance on Bragg and his entourage in the small dusty Mexican town, he seems so confident that you feel a chill run down your spine. Even when he has his knee shot out he seems remarkably composed. I could not leave Harris though without first mentioning his dress sense. That suit is absolutely brilliant and just make shim seem all the more ruthless and undoubtedly cooler.Viggo Mortensen was also somewhat of a surprise. He plays his part very well and seems to be more aware of his surroundings than anyone else. His 8 gauge shotgun is like a part of his character as you will note that when he is on foot it is always near him or in his hands. His final duel with Bragg is also terrific. Unlike Clint Eastwood in his trilogy he seems to be more human. You can see a shadow of doubt as Bragg faces him. Then of course he kills him. This film is a tribute to his acting.The only part of this film that came as an unwelcome surprise was Renne Zellwegger. Many people may disagree with me but I just don't follow what Ed Harris sees in her. When she laughs, her face screws up like a child on the verge of screaming to the point of glass breaking pitch. I also think that she appears to be terribly ugly in this. Whilst the clothes she wears are supposedly fashionable they instead make her look like a Clown with identity issues...If a sequel is made (as there should be) I hope that she is not in it. I am not criticising her acting abilities, I just find her character to be as unpleasant as a rabid dog. So if Renne Zellwegger drops one mark who loses the other? The answer is of course Jeremy Irons. Whilst his character is undoubtedly extremely wicked and malicious his accent is simply appalling. Words cant describe it but trust me it is awful.My final tribute goes to Ed Harris's singing. My oh my but hes bad. So so bad. And yet he is not so bad as to be unwatchable. In fact he actually grows on you...yeah hes not bad...hes amazing...No wait hes really good!!! Well done Ed!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just watched Appaloosa and I kind of liked it. It has everything to offer that is known from the old, good western movies. Shootings, a villain, a nice woman, some funny lines and good actors. Therefore you could say that the movie has a lot clichés. But then again, it had some nice plot turns, which were rather rare in the old days.The movie went on quite a while, but it never seemed too long, slow paced or even boring. The ending was a good one and it was satisfying. I give the movie 8 stars for the story and the good actors. There's hardly something I can criticize. Yes, the story lines where sometimes a bit flat. And Ed Harris was better than he was supposed to be. He said, that the Shelton brothers were as good as he and Hitch were. But they not only killed them without being hurt seriously, but they also killed two other men in the same time.Still a good movie and worth watching it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of my objections to many period movies as well as to most science fiction shows is the temporally challenged writing. It is not a good thing to simply write contemporary attitudes and beliefs back into the past or ahead into the future, although the latter is less objectionable. The paucity of motion pictures and television programmes that manage to sound authentic and non-anachronistic include "Robin and Marian", "Greystoke", "The Warlord" and now "Appaloosa". A study of friendship and attitudes to the Law ring as true as the incomparably accurate clothing, firearms, holsters and buildings (both exterior and interior). I confess to being a nit-picker when it comes to anachronisms in Westerns (even though I can enjoy a good Western even with screaming howlers) but "Appaloosa" gets even its gunfights right (save for one early on) and this is almost unheard of. Perhaps Bragg's men could have worn more colourful cowboy clothing and more black powder smoke could have appeared. The leads are all excellent and conform to 1882 in appearance; there is neither glamour girl nor hunk to be seen. Yes, one might object to the heroes being too old, although Bill Tilghman was older yet when Marshall of Cromwell OK, but it all comes together into one of the greatest low-key Westerns ever made. Kudos to Harris and to all involved.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this after seeing "3:10 to Yuma," which was so bad it made me wonder if I ever wanted to see another western.Thank you, Ed Harris! This film made me a believer again. With a laconic pace that permitted you to enjoy the details, a true western heart, a great story of male friendship, a strikingly ambivalent heroine, great photography, and remarkably good (especially on a budget) art direction, this film managed to be both familiar and fresh at the same time.The story is told from the point of view of Everett Hitch, Viggo Mortensen's character. Ed Harris is wonderful as the quiet mar-shall, Virgil Cole. Renee Zellweger is a decidedly different frontier widow. Jeremy Irons' bad guy may have just a little bit too much fun with his lines, but his character is serviceable and vividly drawn. A pleasant surprise is Spanish actress Ariadna Gil as Katie, the saloon girl who becomes Mortensen's confidante. Some great character actors round out the cast, including a terrific turn by Bob Harris (Ed Harris' father) as a hangin' judge.Nice musical score, too.I really enjoyed this one. Hope you do, too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Offbeat, post-civil war western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An interesting tale of America finding its feet. It's not a classic Western, although Ed Harris, who directs, deserves commendation for trying something original.It must be said that Harris is his own worst enemy in that which doesn't quite work to its potential. It's the classic actor-director situation, the woods being lost to the trees. The biggest detraction for me is the pacing - there are moments in which the film needs to breathe in and out, to absorb its audience into the aspect of its protagonists. Key in this regard is the sequence in which Allie (Zellweger) arrives in town, as seen by Everett. This is the love-triangle drama at the heart of the film and it needs something more pivotal than that which it is afforded (actually, I think Harris knows this but fails to conjure it).Yes, the film has this rather peculiar escalation of moral accumulation - but above this is the love triangle of Virgil (Harris), Everett and Allie. Allie's love has meaning, ramifications but is fickle, conditional. Everett is unquestioningly devoted but impotent in the way a woman can only be. Mortensen plays his role perfectly - terse but not without intellectual depth. Harris manages a pretty good characterisation too, well poised between the hardy male expediency and the cracks of middle-aged vulnerability. Irons is, in the same way, a slippery opportunist. Perhaps Harris had intended that you couldn't quite be assured of the steadfastness of any one bar Everett: this is the film's strength but also it's Achilles' heel. 6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fine addition to the Western crop</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is something fruitfully appealing to the process of watching a court trial during the years of the American Old West frontier. Convicting a man of unlawful activity rests upon circumstantial evidence for the most part. A murder will occur in the middle of the rural terrain, yet everyone will have an opinion as to the exact cause of death. Sometimes the man who committed the crime will reveal the fundamental reality through fear of supposed witnesses giving testimony. This could be the case for rancher Randall Bragg (Jeremy Irons) in "Appaloosa" during his trial in the town of the film's title. An eyewitness is solemnly declaring Bragg's murderous rampage; a rampage that resulted in the loss of three townspeople. Whether Bragg is innocent or guilty of the crime means very little during such trials. It is all speculation. It is all hypocritical also. We have seen the City Marshall Virgil Cole (Ed Harris) carry into effect a killing of great resemblance, and he is the one hoping to hang Bragg high. The whole process is morally ignoble, and it is little wonder the witness needs a head start with the horseback ride out of town.When a Western is updated to appear in the world of modernity, one can do worse than applaud David Cronenberg's "A History of Violence" as a sublime example. You may recall that Viggo Mortensen played the timid Tom Stall, owner of a popular cafe on the main street of this pleasantville, who is stalked by a severely scarred Ed Harris in an ominously menacing black automobile. In "Appaloosa" they are partners and, given Harris is the director of the movie, Mortensen draws upon his Tom/Joey character. His Everett Hitch is once again in the shadow of Harris, this time as the number two man in charge of maintaining the safety of Appaloosa. Everett is suffering from a severe crisis of identity, Although he is cultured in his behaviour, there is a discernible exasperation in his monosyllabic diction and laid-back conduct. As deputy to Virgil's City Marshall status, he is frequently called upon to help with business his job description does not ask of him. Virgil has the unwieldy habit of trying to speak words he must search for in his vocabulary - his inability to speak effortlessly is an Achilles Heel that a Sheriff Everett Hitch would not comprise.Read the full review at my personal website: -- http://www.sightforallseasons.co.nr/</fullReview>

I can't give it a perfect score because the plot is thin and vague. Like picking up a book in the middle and not finishing. But I liked it. Not sure why but it's just laid back and unique. And certainly gives some interest in an 8 Gauge shotgun. There's a fairly good youtube video on this and how to handle one. Which is more explained than the DVD.

		<fullReview>Appaloosa is a good western movie in the tradition of Tombstone, The Outlaw Josey Wales and Silverado. The three main actors are absolutely fantastic in this movie. Ed Harris, Viggo Mortensen and Jeremy Irons bring a great deal of character and life to their characters. Irons has not been this good since he was the voice of Scar in the Lion King. This is Mortensen's best role since Lord of the Rings and Harris is at the top of his game. The story is nicely told and the direction is very well done. The lone negative about this movie is Renee Zellwieger. She is such a lousy actress and she brings a movie that could have been a 10 star movie down to an 8. She does not look the part of a "lady" of the old west either--she looks more of the "call girl" than a lady. She was clearly the wrong choice for this movie. Overlooking Zellwieger---I would recommend this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With Appaloosa we have Ed Harris wearing just about every hat possible in the making of a movie. Star, director, writer, and producer, etc. He even performs one of the songs over the closing credits. This is not the odd thing, though. The odd thing is that he does all these things excellently and puts out a thoughtful and in many ways masterful motion picture.Thoroughly enjoyable and authentic, Appaloosa does not indulge in slo-mo choreographed violence, nor does it make an icon out of its hero. But the picture does get its point across. The characters are real people and are portrayed extremely well by all members of the cast. Some reviewers here have criticized Zellweggers character, Ali, as one superimposed and unnecessary. On the contrary, I believe she is key to this story. Her loose morals and desire to be with the top man is an interesting plot twist (somewhat like Kim Basinger's Memo Paris in The Natural). The only omission is that we are never told why Ali arrives in Appaloosa in the first place. A minor complaint.Also, the movie is breathtaking to look at. Scenes of the town, the terrain, the train, and even small details are filmed with loving care.This is a thinking man's Western, as many of the best of them are: High Noon, The Unforgiven, Stagecoach, The Shootist, Hombre, Butch Cassidy &amp; the Sundance Kid, etc., etc. Appaloosa belongs in this company.See it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Much too good for children</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Appaloosa changed the way I look at life.The film was simply about two lawmen performing the tasks that their life events necessitated. With no climax and no glamor, this unique work effectively becomes unabashedly didactic and embodies the nature of the human condition: we do what we have to do. Its Western setting adds to its charm and raw beauty. It really offers an unparalleled motion picture experience. Saying that it is my favorite movie doesn't even do the film justice. It was just so wonderfully done.Plus Ed Harris pulled off an amazing acting, directing, writing, and producing feat. Virgil Cole is the quintessential ne'er do well bad ass Western marshal and the shine on this gem.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Appaloosa" is probably the first film ever made with all the actors as skilled horsemen and horsewoman. Viggo Mortensen's riding skills are exceptional: the best ever filmed especially when he rides uphill to present the gift of a horse to the Indian. The riders reined with Spanish-grip having the reins pass from the fifth digit running up over the first digit with the thumb on top (12:00 o'clock); this is very different from the American-grip having the reins pass over the first digit running down out over the fifth digit with the thumb forward (9:00 o'clock): like holding a broom handle. Another point I found unique is Harris' and Mortensen's horses looked identical, like twins. And about Renée Zellweger, regardless what a number of film-critics said, her character is essential to the story, and she does a good job with it, IMHO.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ed Harris wrote this? Well it seems like he started writing it sober and then got very very drunk (or vice versa) and tacked on the last hour of the movie.The Allison character enters late, and when she does things begin to unravel. I had high hopes for this movie but not overreaching expectations. The plot just started out so good, but then it became some kind of romance/intrigue play that just so happens to be set in the wild west. It could have been space or Ancient Rome, it does not matter one bit.Avoid this movie at all costs.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not your standard western but better because of it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Appaloosa is set in the 1880s and follows the story of 'peacekeepers' Virgil Cole (Harris) and Everett Hitch (Viggo Mortensen) as they are hired by the leading citizens of the eponymous town to protect their interests from Randall Bragg (Jeremy Irons), whose men more or less bully the townspeople at will. Virgil and Everett have worked together for years and know each other very well; they're a very effective team, but they are thrown off-balance by the arrival of Allison French (Renee Zellweger), who takes an immediate liking to Virgil.At first look the movie seems like a straightforward western ? good guys have to find a way to restore law and order and capture the bad guy ? but I realized, when the 'story' climaxed somewhere in the middle of the film, that I had been fooled (or that I fooled myself); Appaloosa is really about the friendship between Virgil and Everett. There's an external plot, of course, and it is important, but it takes a back seat ? not obviously, mind you ? to the larger picture of the two men. In lesser hands I think this could have been a major backfire, but here, it makes the movie special.Harris is very sharp as Virgil, a man who understands his shortcomings and flaws as well as his strengths. But the movie really belongs to Viggo Mortensen, who is so good here he should have been nominated for an Oscar. Viggo plays Everett with such subtlety and intelligence that he steals the spotlight, and the sidekick ends up seeming like the main character ? and possibly he is, by design. The craft that these two display ? aided by a crafty, witty, smart script ? is impressive; the rest of the cast is very good too (Irons is thankfully restrained), but none of them can compete with the two leads. Appaloosa is a smart, well-done movie. It's not a standard western, but it's far better because of it. It was obviously a labor of love for Harris, and that shows through in every scene. I was deeply impressed with and pleased by this movie; unless you just can't abide westerns (or one of the leads), do yourself a favor and check out this unfairly overlooked film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is not an action movie nor a romantic comedy. It is not comic hero movie or animation. This is just a good movie. From the script, to the direction, to the acting,(top to bottom), to the filming, this movie nails the telling of a story and making it feel real. It even seems like a true story. You wonder as you watch, "Are these real people?" And, by the end, you know they are, although, they are not. An excellent example of the true art of story telling on the big screen. Kudos Ed Harris and all who worked on this fine film! Please give this movie a shot at wide release! Apaloosa is a western for yesterday and today, because it has a purpose. These people; good, bad, right, wrong; represent even today. A city with law in a territory without it until a pair of men bring it only to see authority greater than the right or the wrong destroy it. And the romantic story within the story is also very compelling.</fullReview>

Check. Mysterious stranger riding into town? Check? The obligatory Indian scene? Check.) Yet, the movie's only original idea, a grizzled lawman acting foolishly for a love interest falls short as it is, simply, over the top.The standard I apply in recommending any western is whether I can see John Wayne or Clint Eastwood being a part of the movie. I just can't see either of the two acting in this mediocre effort. I wouldn't even waste my time watching it on DVD.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If Harris can make more movies like this....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>... I hope he lives to be a hundred. This is hands down one of the most engaging and immersive western I have ever seen in my life. The character study in this film hearkens towards the hard men that populated Peckinpah's movies, while at the same time the violence never really tries to be excessively stylish (a crucially positive point in my estimation). It is a world populated with deeply flawed characters who are in equal measures other-worldly and firmly secured within the cling of humanity. Furthermore, while wearing its influences on its sleeve (as any modern western must do), it still retains a sense of originality. It resists the temptation to be a vehicle of stylised violence filled with the usual two-dimensional characters that usually saturate westerns, and opts for a sense of introspective maturity.This is really one of the best films I have ever personally seen about the nature of men and the conflicts that often surround mens lives concerning loyalty, violence and love. The chemistry between Mortenson and Harris works very well (Mortenson is very convincing), while Zellweger is cast perfectly. She completely pulls her character off, because she never becomes the conniving contemptuous she-snake that another actor would have turned her into, but instead fills the character with sympathy and vulnerability, without which the story actually would seriously suffer, in my opinion (I believe Diane Lane was originally cast). Having Henrikson show up was a total treat, as well. The only real flaw in the film was some of the supporting cast: Irons' accent is terrible, despite a convincing performance otherwise; Spall as well really doesn't pull off the accent either. Nevertheless, these are minor detractions to what is overall possibly the most compelling western since Eastwood's 'Unforgiven'. It appeals strongly to the introspective aspect of the male mind, which should walk away from this film feeling moved and contemplative, rather than adrenalised and pumped.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went to see Appaloosa thinking it would be a remake of the film The Appaloosa,which the only thing I remember about it is that Marlon Brando(1924-2004)'s character wanted to get his horse back.But Appaloosa did not result a remake,but an adaptation from a book which was published in this decade,and although it makes a tribute to the characteristics of western,it does not add too much to the genre.But,in spite of that,it results a good movie.Although I am not a big fan of "old westerns",I have liked some of them pretty much and I recognize that Appaloosa follows the theme,rhythm and structure the genre has had from its beginnings : simple moral fables set on the North American old west with characters who reflect the nostalgia for an existence more simple but more complicated,marking the transition from the barbarism of the "wild one" and the rising social culture,which requires less honor and less ingenuity and more subterfuge,hypocrisy and paranoia for surviving on a completely different level.I understand the interest behind that.But,after seeing so many similar stories during a long time,I need a story which gives new life to that.Unfortunately,Appaloosa does not aspire to so much,so it is a rehash of the well-known clichés : the fair and honourable heroes; the greedy and cruel villain who does not respect the law; the flirt widow who falls in love with the two heroes; and,of course,the shootouts in rural landscapes of meadows and mountains.The modern westerns I liked very much had an innovative element which gave new life to the genre : the philosophy of Unforgiven; the visual surrealism of The Quick and The Dead; the humor of Silverado; and the deep emotions of The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford.Although Appaloosa is a good movie,there is not nothing innovative to make it memorable.Fortunately,it has various positive elements.The screenplay is well written and the beginning and ending are very good (the middle part is also solid,but there are some boring and redundant scenes on it).Ed Harris made a good work on his second experience as a director (the first one was the competent Pollock),although his weak point is on the visual aspect,which does not result too special.But,I think his best work is in the direction of actors.Viggo Mortensen and him bring perfect performances and they can bring life to their characters.The member of the cast who mostly stands out is the great Jeremy Irons,who backs to prove his enormous talent,because he is completely natural and credible on his role on this movie.Renée Zellweger brings a correct performance,although she does not have much to do.Appaloosa is a solid movie,I do not deny it.But its lack of originality and not having innovative elements on the screenplay,make of it a good but forgettable experience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Buddies in love . . .</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If Ed Harris's Appaloosa weren't such a good film, it would be a risible parody of the western genre, replete with hired lawmen/gunmen, bad guy big shot with his baddies, femme fatale, and never ending banter, brush, and blue sky. But it is solid drama involving friendship tested, love uncertain, and choices not easy to make between justice and revenge.As Virgil (Harris) and Everett (Vigo Mortensen) arrive in a small 19th century New Mexico town, they are hired by the central-casting town fathers to shoo away some malicious "flies" (I've unknowingly slinked into The Magnificent Seven) headed by the coolly corrupt Randall Bragg (Jeremy Irons), who all help themselves to town goods without paying and blow away a sheriff and two deputies who came out to the ranch to imprison two of the bad guys.The real conflict outside the usual oater good and bad standoffs is the pretty newcomer, Mrs. Alison French, played by Renee Zellweger, whose roving eye doesn't stop Virgil from falling in love with her. Poor Everett?she comes on to him, and he won't tell Virgil, although her complex character eventually reveals itself to the na?ve Virgil. Good ambiguity in this romance, subtle by contrast with the downright cowardice of Grace Kelly's wife in High Noon. Virgil struggles to accept her in the face of her infidelity, and Everett struggles with his love for Virgil and dislike of Mrs. French's roaming.The film tries to explain the survival techniques of a lone woman in the territories, and in so doing it makes it easier to understand the situational ethics employed by the disenfranchised anywhere at any time. The film is equally interested in the relationship of the two buddies, not Butch and Sundance?they're not serious enough, and not Montgomery Clift and John Ireland seemingly in love in Red River, and not the eventually gay twosome in Brokeback Mountain.However, they are ever so much straight guys like me with close buddies for whom loyalty is coin of the realm, not sex.The shots are long and slow, the conversation equally so, and the intersecting interests are a microcosm of world politics. Besides the stunning landscapes, the camera loves the close ups of Harris and Mortensen, both with chiseled features seeming to come out of the rough-hewn landscape.I was rhapsodic about Open Range and 3:10 to Yuma, and now I'm throwing another A at another revival much to the amusement of my radio buddy, Johnny DiLoretto, who, at a young age, loves even older oaters than I. I know you're going to accuse all of us of escaping from women, but really, we're running to them getting help from buddies along the way</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not even an excellent cast can help this often muddled film. Bring back the westerns of the 1950s, they had class, intelligence, and people who could speak their lines.Renee Zellwegger has the part that Shirley MacLaine would have had in the old days. Suddenly, she is on scene as a widow, and after Cole (Ed Harris) asks her if she is a whore, the two plan a house together.Viggo Mortensen is his side kick and deputy Everett Hitch. Mortensen falls for Zellwegger as well but there is no absolute final conflict between the two men.It is Jeremy Irons who is the real laugh here. This erudite actor is horrendously miscast as the villain. Irons sounds more like a sophisticated gentleman than a bad guy in the 1880s.Since when has Chester Arthur ever been mentioned in films? While it is true that the film takes place in the territory of New Mexico, 40 years before statehood was achieved in 1912, the only thing we might remember Arthur for is becoming president after Garfield was assassinated. Students of history would remember the Pendleton or Civil Service Act of 1883, but that's another story.Even the scenes with the Indians have little to no action. Ed Harris, you're a terrific actor and I liked you with that big brim hat, but this picture is a definite bomb.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's a shame this brilliant film has gone so unnoticed.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first heard about the film it instantly became one of my most anticipated, but then when it came out and everyone had the same 'meh' reaction to it, I let that anticipation drop. Well, it turned out to be just as good as I originally thought it would be. Ed Harris' direction is top-notch and he uses every aspect of the film to create this extraordinarily authentic western universe that enables these interesting characters to interact in a very immersive environment. The cinematography and score are both astounding and help tremendously in crafting this world. Harris plays Virgil Cole, who rides into the town of Appaloosa with his right-hand man Everett Hitch (Viggo Mortensen) to become the new Marshall and protect the town from the villainous Randall Bragg (Jeremy Irons).I saw Cole and Bragg as the same person on different sides of the law; they are both sophisticated, quiet men who settle their disputes quickly with violence instead of words. Neither man is extravagant or particularly dangerous on the surface, but their sole presence adds a certain suspense to the scene and you can always feel an evil lurking just beneath the exterior. Early on in the film, we see Cole snap and beat the hell out of a drunk at a bar for no particular reason. This darkness is what made him such an interesting character for me; behind those steely blue eyes there is always something mysterious burning that I found terrifying.However it's Mortensen's Hitch who turns out to be the most intriguing character of the film. In his opening narration we find out that he met Cole by chance when he rode up on him in the middle of a fight with some men, and Hitch protected him. Through that random encounter they became best friends and their loyalty to each other is thicker than blood. Throughout most of the film Hitch seems to be just Cole's badass sidekick, but we slowly begin to learn that he has more depth than anyone else in this story. A little over halfway through, Cole tells Everett that 'feelings get you killed' and everyone seems to live by that little motto throughout the story, while Everett tries to figure out his place in a world with that mentality. In the final act he realizes that everyone is turning a blind eye to the evil of Bragg and what he has done, letting this town and the relationships in it slowly fall apart instead of confronting the man; so he decides to do something about it. His transition throughout the film from Cole's sidekick to the only man who lets his feelings determine his actions was striking. He sacrifices his own place in the town in order to better everyone else, and then he rides off into the dwindling sun.In the end we realize that the film isn't focusing on Cole's time in Appaloosa but is instead focusing on the time that Hitch and Cole spent working side-by-side. We begin with them strolling into the town and end with Hitch riding away while Cole stays in town. Hitch is somewhat of a classic western drifter, who comes upon Cole by chance and protects him from danger so the two work together and then he rides away at the end to an undetermined future. An incredibly interesting character that Mortensen brings to life with a phenomenal performance. He's definitely the most impressive of the cast (and I wouldn't be surprised if he remains in my Lead Actor lineup at the end of the year) but Irons and especially Harris shine as well. It really was a fantastic story with very interesting characters set in a perfectly realized western universe. Loved it. It's a shame that the majority of people have had such a mediocre reaction to it. Oh and for the record I didn't mention Zellweger's performance or character because they were both so uninteresting that they didn't really warrant mention.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Harris as director confuses dryness with simplicity in this well-acted Western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wasn't sure what to expect with Appaloosa, as the TV ads said one thing- the now old "a western in the tradition of Unforgiven..."- and the critics have been saying another (some good, some not so good). As it turns out Ed Harris's sophomore outing as a director, also as main actor and co-writer of the script, has some points that make it an enjoyable enough genre entry, but something is sort of missing in how it was executed. It is not so much that it is poorly directed, as the pacing seems fine, and the performances are pretty much up to par with what we'd expect from the principles (Harris, Mortensen, Zellwegger and Irons, plus that one creepy killer from A History of Violence in a juicy supporting role). What it is, perhaps, is a translation from the source material of Robert Parker's novel - or even, further perhaps, that the novel wasn't any great shakes to begin with.The premise seems simple, and one might think it stays that way, like a stilted sunset, throughout Appaloosa: a Marshall (Harris) and his Deputy (Mortensen) ride into town upon threats from a gang run by a crook who also happens to run the local hotel, Bragg (Irons), and it looks as though not only will Harris have a potential mess on his hands (capture, trial, plotted-escape, pardon thanks to President Chester A. Arthur), but may get the new girl in town (Zellwegger) who comes in as the local piano player. The only big complications in this set-up, aside from some fairly obvious twists and turns involving side-plots and searching and a minute with some local Indians, is that the Deputy may possibly have a crush on Zellwegger, or maybe it's just an honor thing. Either way, it becomes a subtly uncomfortable three-some.Both Harris and Mortensen strike distinctive figures as part of a western landscape, and Harris knows this as director first. Without these two in the roles it could have been just some straight-to-TNT stuff, decent but nothing much to write home about unless a hardcore genre fan. Then again, mostly hardcore genre fans will really dig it, not so much those who think a Western is just 3:10 to Yuma and maybe, if they want to sound 'arty, The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford. But Harris, unlike even those two examples (and for the latter just as that's more ambitious if flawed), can't seem to strike a chord with the story to make it very much interesting past some quirks in the characters (i.e. Sheriff's running-gag in not knowing certain words) and a sorrowful last ten minutes. It is, more or less... dry. It should work better than it does, but a lot of it just rolls along, with its actors caught up in the 'simplicity' of it all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I tried to restrain myself for summarizing this film this way but I can't help but say this is definitely catered to old fashioned western fans. I love the theme, from spaghetti western films to John Wayne and Ford films. I love the period, showing how my country was born.This film bored the people I watched it with, including my mom, and some friends who said they fell asleep during the middle. Of course, they aren't old fashioned film fans like I am. Heres what I loved about the film- The set design and directing was really awesome. Ed Harris was lucky to get good backing for his project. His classic wide-angle direction and still shots were complimented by loads of detail, excellent design to not only the sets, but the clothes and unique guns in the film. This film featured a beautiful train, old Mexican villages, and new towns full of laundromats, Hardware stores, and big hotels.Now the reason why it will bore casual movie-goers is because its very slow. The gun fights were excellent in my mind, but very, very short in duration making it more realistic. Gun fights were quick in those days, most of the people didn't know how to aim those big ol revolvers, heavy on recoil. There are no Hollywood style chases and its a very mellow-dramatic movie, with political tones.The love subplot might have been enough to lure in the female audience, but Renee Zellwegger is just terrible in this film. I think she acted in too many comedies and forgot how to act. I liked Irons and Mortensen best, although Mortenson tried too hard to mimic Clint Eastwood in this film, as so did Ed Harris. Jeremy Irons stole the show, but he wasn't given enough screen time.Overall a 7/10. Satisfying ending, and decent script make it worthwhile. The soundtrack also grew on me. The end credits for this film are amazing featuring great still photography and some great songs!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A transparent movie: two gunslingers who make a living as sheriffs find trouble with bad guys and women. That's pretty much the plot of this movie. What happens isn't particularly interesting. You've got great actors doing their stuff but the story doesn't pull you in. Jeremy Irons does a wonderful job as the villain but is given almost nothing to work with (perhaps worth watching to see what a pro can make of zilch). Renée Zellweger delivers a great performance with pathetically little?really, less than Irons (the two must have been drawn into this movie by friendship with Harris). In writing these reviews one is warned about indicating whether one is giving a review with a spoiler, but with this movie there is nothing to spoil. The ending is a low key attempt?one almost feels sorry for Jeremy Irons?to camouflage the fact that the writers and director didn't really know what to do with the story. Bottom line, good acting in a terrible script with, sad to say, bad directing from Ed Harris, who apparently wanted to place a slow moving somberness over the whole but ended up making a frankly boring movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the kind of film Eastwood might have made when he was still making westerns and when his name tagged to a film was enough to allow him to pander to his own whims rather than those of his fan base. Initially I thought Eastwood would have taken the Ed Harris role, but as the plot unfolded at its own determinedly stately pace it became clear that the Viggo Mortenson character fitted the Eastwood template much more closely.Renee Zellweger is miscast, but her character is an interesting and unusual one for a western. Psychoanalysts could no doubt write a book about her, and the fact that Harris's character not only fails to see her true worth but is prepared to overlook it once it has been made clear to him confirms, as starkly as his repeated turning to Hitch to supply the correct word he is struggling to find, the fact that Virgil is a good man but a man with little insight and limited understanding of people in a world that is changing around him.This film won't appeal to fans of traditional westerns (it's an ironic fact that the near-death of the western means that, generally speaking, only quality western projects that explore universal themes make it to the screen these days) but those who aren't bothered by a slow, thoughtful pace will be rewarded by giving this one their attention.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It kind of flew under the radar, but Ed Harris' film Appaloosa is a pretty solid western. As only his second foray behind the camera, after the very good art biography Pollack, Harris has upped the stakes a bit in terms of scope and execution. Sure an old time western set around New Mexico territory isn't all that posh and expensive, but it is impressive nonetheless. Between the costumes and the authenticity needed to make it real, something that HBO showed was possible with their dead before its time "Deadwood", the film gets all the grit and moral toughness you would expect in a world where a man's word is his bond and the ability to look death in the face a necessity. Credit the actor also for pulling out an inspired performance equal parts restraint and repressed anger, a lawman with the need to educate himself and better his vocabulary, a person that never lies because the truth is just easier. Harris' Virgil Cole is the kind of sheriff you want in your town, one who'd never compromise his values nor let a murderer run free and unchecked despite a Presidential pardon.I find, with a very light western film knowledge, that the best of the genre are those unafraid to stay stoic and deliberate, allowing the events to transpire in their own time, never rushing to a scene of violence or action, but letting them occur naturally. For the most part, Appaloosa does just that. When you have characters like Harris and Viggo Mortensen's Everett Hitch, two men with a common understanding and shorthand of communication consisting of head movements and body language, you know the film itself will probably be just as buttoned up and precise. Feelings may get you killed in a society only on the cusp of order, but these two men know when compassion and emotion are necessary to remain human, despite the consequences that may follow. In effect, both are hired to kill a band of outlaws under control of Randall Bragg, the always-riveting Jeremy Irons. By signing the town over to Harris, the citizens pretty much give him carte blanche on what he's allowed to do to keep order. The job always comes first, but certain circumstances have a way of finding a spot in the plot, shaking things up a bit and leading them astray just enough to add a bit of suspense.Throw in a beautiful newcomer played by Renée Zellweger to stir into the pot and you know trouble will be brewing. The unknowing femme fatale, she is the kind of woman who needs to feel secure and safe, shacking up with the man in charge to make sure she stays that way. Unfortunately, that also means that once the current "love" falls just a bit out of favor, below someone else, she won't hesitate to make her move strong and early. But these boys are cowboys?with nerves of steel and blood cold as ice?they can see the reality of situations and not let emotions fool their minds. The real object at hand is doing the job, serving the town, and hanging a convicted murderer. There will of course be bumps along the way, but that goal will never stray from being at the forefront. Cole and Hitch have been doing this sort of work for too long to not realize what truly matters.I'll admit to not being a fan of Zellweger early on; her character was just annoying and seemingly inconsequential. However, as the tale continued on, her role becomes more crucial and her actions understandable in the context of whom she is. Once the façade of waif-like na?veté wears off, as the truth comes out of what kind of person she is, you begin to see the vulnerability and fearlessness at her core. Still probably the weakest link in the film, I did eventually learn to appreciate the role. Many supporting parts come into their own throughout, including a nice tough guy turn from Timothy V. Murphy and a couple more from Lance Henriksen and Adam Nelson, but the real winners are the trio at the top. Irons is a brilliant combination of intellect and conniving malice, as only the best villains can be composed. His utter brutality and fervor to save his own skin come alive with screams and aggression, but his eloquence and knowledge of the world make you wonder about what lies behind the hard exterior. And both Harris and Mortensen shine as the partners in control, staring their own mortality in the face, knowing they can and will beat it every time. Their dynamic is perfect, especially the need of Viggo to finish his boss's need to pull a big word out of his head.By no means is Appaloosa a masterpiece, but it does its job well. The construction left a little to be desired by me as I almost thought the film would end very early and barely make the 90 minute mark. After introductions and the subsequent capture and trial we all were waiting for happened, there doesn't seem to be much else to see. However, there is more as characters come back and cross each other's paths yet again to lead towards a very good ending that I enjoyed immensely for its mix of slight closure and open-ending curiosity. My one qualm is with the half hour or so between these two successes, a period of time utilized to bridge the end of act one to the climatic final showdown. The time plods along and begins to unravel into nonsense and repetition. Thankfully it all does occur for a reason, and for that I can accept it for what it was and remember the enjoyment I had despite it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>With a solid cast behind him to back him up, Ed Harris does a respectable western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all let's make it clear, Ed Harris is no Clint Eastwood. And it would be terribly unfair to compare him both as an actor or a director of Westerns to Clint, who literally made his career and defined the Western genre. But that doesn't take anything away from Ed Harris' Appaloosa, instead the viewer must watch it with an open mind and stop comparing it to Unforgiven or any other westerns.I enjoyed the movie's slow pace, but there was something about the direction that makes it different than most movies on the silver screen. Only until near the end did I realize that Appaloosa would probably have fared much better as a TV special. Even the cinematography resembled something from a TV series. I thoroughly enjoyed the gunfights, they were gritty and very realistic. None of that ten paces and draw showmanship, just pure speed and a bit of luck. Gunfights shouldn't last more than 5 seconds, maybe 10 if there's a lot of people and wild shooting. Ed Harris is extremely badass in his role.Appaloosa had a great cast. Viggo Mortensen (Aragorn from Lord of the Rings) is an extremely good actor, he really needs to do more movies. He is so well known for his Aragorn character, yet he can pull off a completely different character here. Jeremy Irons is always a great choice for a villain. Renee Zellweger does her familiar role as the love interest between multiple characters, and a surprise inclusion from Lance Henriksen (Ace Hanlon from The Quick and the Dead) adds depth to an interesting story. And of course Ed Harris himself, one of Hollywood's finest actors, he has an amazing screen presence and is good in pretty much any role he's given (and in this case, his own role that he created). His directorial abilities is still out for the jury, but he has done his acting abilities no harm at all in Appaloosa. He was fantastic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Your Everyday Western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Appaloosa is an excellent Western with lots of twists to the old formula. While it has the stalwart hero (Ed Harris) and his sidekick (Viggo M.) in this case both stalwart, it also switches the trends of a male stranger coming to town. In this case it's a woman, Renee Z, Who is she? Why is she there? Why does she only have a dollar in her pocket? No one knows, but soon is she is shacking up with our anti-hero Ed Harris, used as the pawn by our villain (Jermemy Irons) and proving that women can be as self-protective and promiscuous as men. The psychology is as good as the action in this unique Western and if I have any carps at all, they may not even be errors, but deliberate for some reason of the director. They are: 1. Why was Marshall spelled wrong on the sign when both men were word-conscious? 2, Why wasn't the passage of time more clearly indicated after the thrilling shoot-out? A film to add to the list of great Westerns without a doubt.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Different Western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Appaloosa is not Ed Harris' directorial debut (there is the movie Pollock from 2000) but is quite a movie. Unlike the conventional Western (and the last I saw was the copybook 3.10 to Yuma), this dwells on a morally ambiguous woman (Alison - Renee Zellweger) and the cast's interrelationships with her. There is the very public romance with the marshal (Virgil - Ed Harris), the ambiguous relationship with the deputy (Everett - Viggo Mortensen), and then the obvious promiscuity and Everett's final solution that is as abrupt as it is surprising. Life does not always take the paths that one desires, and sometimes one takes ingenuous solutions to get it around to our choices. What truly is the moral high ground of a mere vigilante prone to violence, or the calumny of a villain (Randall Bragg ? Jeremy Irons) who is erudite and convincing and commits little that can be unequivocally labeled as villainy in a difficult time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Traditional western that doesn't forsake old-fashioned badassery in the name of character development</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Far from perfect, you can bet on that, yet endlessly enjoyable old fashioned western. What movie is without flaws after all? Here, to get the bad out of the way right off the start, they take the form of Viggo Mortensen's unconvincing accent, a few technical slipus here and there the result of an inexperienced director, and a jarring, ill-advised voice-over narration bookending the movie. Renee Zelweger is the weak link in the cast and Jeremy Irons's baddie is a stock character. Yet what fascinating storytelling. A simple story, simply told.One thing should be clear though. Harris isn't trying to redefine the genre and I don't find any reason why he should. The seventies are as long ago as the boom of the traditional western from the revisionism of the seventies and the spaghetti western. Audiences aren't fed up with oversimplified tales of frontier justice like they were. They haven't waded through harmless family sitcom after harmless family sitcom to beg for a breath of fresh air, anything different. Shangai Joe was a product of those times. I'd say the ground for traditional western mythmaking is once again open as Harris amply demonstrates with this poignant, unpretentious, traditional western where the bad guys are bad and the good guys mostly good, although not without a mean streak in them that allows Harris to pistol-whip goons before he asks their name.Moving along in an unhurried pace of quietude but not refusing to get dirtied when it must. As much a beautiful character-driven drama as it is a genre western, Appaloosa oneups every other western to come out this decade by fitting together old school western badassery in the form of a gruff, no-nonsese peacemaker Virgil Cole (black-clad in his best Sabata attire), notions of justice, friendship and doing what one must, great writing and period detail. Heck, even an encounter with thieving Indians avoids all schmaltz and politics. And with cinematographer Dean Semler's help (who has, to put it mildly, an interesting resume, with work on Mad Max 2, Super Mario Bros and Apocalypto under his belt), even the slight cop-out (or character inconsistency) of the ending is forgiven in one more astonishing panorama of visual splendor. Many such "print it and hang it on your wall" moments to be had.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The spirit of Lonesome Dove, but not quite as good.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not the person to review this film. Stop reading my review now. Since you chose to ignore my advice, then let me warn you that you'll be reading a review of a Western written by someone who has little experience reviewing the genre nor admiration for it. Appaloosa is the first Western I've ever viewed in theater, and only the forth Western I've seen in its entirety. The other titles I've seen are both versions of 3:10 to Yuma and Lonesome Dove.Fans of the genre will be thrilled to mark the return of "the traditional Western," which is what this film is supposed to represent. I don't apply value to such vague terminology but maybe I should. Can you imagine a successful Western movie without Indians, outlaws, sassy women, and rogue-heroes? I, for one, couldn't, but I found 3:10 to Yuma's (remake) abandonment of many of these tropes surprisingly satisfying. Maybe that film's strength is a source of this one's. 3:10 to Yuma gave a slightly different approach to the Western that may have left audiences craving for its traditional format. Even, and likely, assuming that my inference is a narrative fallacy, Appaloosa is still a good motion picture. I do, however, know that it was made possible by 3:10 to Yuma's box office success and stellar Blu-ray sells.The story is very simple, as it should be. The town of Appaloosa, New Mexico is terrorized by a group of thugs. Most of their names aren't important, as many are either killed or disappear after the opening scene. The ringleader is a cretin by the name of Randall Bragg. Two cowboys, Virgil Cole and Everett Hitch, come to town and offer their services to dispatch the villains. The town marshal gladly agrees and grants them authority to do (and kill) as they please. Virgil and Everett are successful in pacifying the villains and incarcerating Bragg, but ironically, become entangled in a romantic triangle of sorts. Enter the delightful Allison "Alley" French, a widow seeking comfort in a new husband. She easily woos Virgil and convinces him to settle. Nevertheless, she makes several moves on Everett as a potential husband. This is short-lived as Bragg later escapes and kidnaps Alley. While in pursuit, Virgil observes her intermingling with Bragg in a most inappropriate way. Bragg is later pardoned of all crimes by the President and becomes a business owner, until the film's climax.When watching this title, I felt reminiscent of the same sensation I felt when watching Lonesome Dove and reading its novel counterpart. Virgil and Everett have a brotherly relationship, much like Gus and Call, where one man is clearly in authority over the other. Virgil is Gus in this film. He even share's Gus' odd academic interest in literature. Similarly, like Call, Everett is the bulwark of the two. Let me avail you of one thought I've lead you to believe. I am not saying that Gus and Call have been reborn, but their archetypes have been employed here. There are still many differences between the pairs, but I won't address those here.Indians are not prominently featured either. Given their absence from last year's movie, is the Western transitioning into a 21st century identity? I imagine so. Many people are offended by Native American mascots, so I can't fathom how they would tolerate the traditional Western's portrayal of Indians. There is only a single scene in which Native Americans are featured in this film, and they are not treated as uncivilized. I didn't see much use to this scene, and question its inclusion.Speaking of sparse oddities, there are few instances of violence in this entry. The majority of the experience is acquainting with the two leads. I enjoyed this aspect tremendously, but I felt that Alley's character added little to the process. She serves as comedic spice for Virgil, particularly. Her character isn't developed otherwise, and she could have been replaced with a valuable item (which Bragg would have to steal) or something similar. At its core, Appaloosa is a film about the conflict between judicial law and personal justice. The town mayor grants the leads the ability to do as they please, which results in several of Bragg's men being killed. Then, he is pardoned but threatens to kill his former farm hand that revealed his presence. The final sequence is also example of this trend, but you'll have to discover that on your own. If we have only one Western each year, I won't complain. This is a quality film, whether you enjoy Westerns or not. It includes an additional crime solving element, which gives it wider appeal. Despite a few character issues, Ed Harris did a remarkable job in directing, acting, producing, and writing this film. Since Robert B. Parker, author of the original novel, has written a sequel, I hope for another chance to visit Virgil and Everett.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Almost too good to be "true" . . .</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, and make that a drawl, please, after waiting for the DVD and watching it as carefully as an old poot can, with wretched vision and even worse hearing, thus missing subtleties of tone and texture, I find myself, as a longtime fan of BOTH Ed Harris AND Viggo Mortensen, more than pleased and "pleasured." At the start, I thought, what the Hell, this is just a contemporary spin off of ye olde Republic westerns that boasted good black-and-white cinematography and not much else, but, soon, I was disabused of my own predilections. This flick, as the lead "commentator" today, "pswitzertatum" proclaims, is, in fact, a revelation of "today's" values superimposed on the old tintype version of "pioneer" "western" realities. As such, I, like switzertatum, found much to admire and even some to treasure in the evocation and unfoldment of this "classic" projection of onetime American beliefs and convictions. And, as none others evinced in the few "reviews" I also read here, this woman and her husband perceived something no one else did, or did they? Which is to say that the "buddy" theme here is paramount, that the only true "love" here is between two "males," and that sexuality and gender aside, "relationships" are only as strong or meaningful as the truths thereof. Yes, it's a "romantic" as well as feel-good flick, as the hero rides off into that everlasting sunset, having despatched the "villain" since society refuses to do so. Ah, an "adult" "Shane," even as both Mortensen and Harris are actors beyond the skill and vision and achievements of the likes of the late Alan Ladd. Such subtleties, of course, are more or less irrelevant here, except to old-poot observers who recall the likes of the film debuts of, say, Tony Curtis, or Sterling Hayden, or, very especially, Paul Newman, whose maiden effort was nothing short of embarrassing. Still, each of them soldiered on to their respective iconisms. That said, I agree with the poster who averred Mortensen should have at least an Oscar and more than a few "nominations" thereto. And Harris was an even better heavy than Jeremy Irons here, in another underrated meditation on life and living, contemporary or "historic," "An Act of Violence." That IMDb folk rank this film at a mere 6.9 is simply one more evidence of juvey, superficial tastes AND judgments.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Potential Classic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Appaloosa comes close to being a classic Western movie with only a few scars from gaining the recognition it was capable of. The constellation of lead actors were pretty damn good, with some great chemistry as banter flew in all levels flew. Wherein lies scar #1: Sometimes the banter wasn't enough to carry everything that the story was capable of. Not that it didn't enhance things, the playfulness between Ed Harris and Viggo Mortensen was laced with truth and comradeship. Sometimes the potential of falling into the quagmire of various relationships walked the edge and could have made the movie clumsy... but thankfully it didn't. The story builds up to the point that you know doom is inevitable, but unlike the ending of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid it never quite comes to fulfillment. Scar #2 gave you a period in the movie that potentially makes you impatient. For the most part, pacing is adequate, giving shots of adrenaline when needed, but not quite giving you the suspense that is necessary to hold you through the "dry" spots (Like No Country For Old Men). Finally, scar #3 just didn't give me an ending that delivered. Sure, there was a "Riding into the sunset" like many good cowboy movies have, but leading up to that glorious sequence things just happen too fast. This is just my take.The plot is pretty conventional: A town hires mercenaries to take care of a local rancher that shoots down the sheriff and his deputes. And of course you have the girl that just stumbles into town, and other mercenaries that have been hired after the rancher is found guilty. It's an average carriage ride except as I said, it's the wonderful honesty in the conversational banter that really carries this film. It make for a good sit at the local Drafthouse for a matinées, but for me it just wasn't all that memorable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>New Age shoddy...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The 1860s gave rise to unprecedented invention in this country: there was a war on, and there were untapped markets to be milked. Or bilked. It came to be known as "the Age of Shoddy." This newest Age of Shoddy has produced more than its share of dreck- everything from personal computers (which, even when they function properly, are prone to "viruses" that can cost thousands of dollars just to try to repair) (and, if you're one of the lucky few whose printer actually works after the second or third usage, consider yourself blessed by the Gods of Shoddy) to combination vcr and DVD players (which invariably become one or the other, with at least one of the two components malfunctioning shortly after purchase) to cellular phones (whose astronomical costs never seem to justify their usage) to monthly cable bills that continue to expand exponentially, no matter how loud you wail (and cable lineups that offer you little more than reruns of old shows you didn't bother to watch when they were first aired) to bloated, laughably written and listlessly directed movies like APPALOOSA. The remake of 3:10 TO YUMA I could live with (though just barely), but APPALOOSA makes movies like the overrated ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST look good. (ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST is second only to EL TOPO in terms of "homage." And Alejandro Jodorowski himself wrote an entire book detailing the endless "meanings" to be found in his half-baked "spiritual western.") Want to see a really good western? Check out UNFORGIVEN or OPEN RANGE or BROKEN TRAIL or pretty much anything directed by Bud Boetticher. But do yourself a favor and give APPALOOSA a pass.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Appaloosa starts off well with an interesting and believable premise: a partnership between two lawmen, long on integrity and courage, who come to a town to rid it of lawless scum.The plot begins to derail, however, when Renee Zellinger steps off the train. I'm sorry but I find it hard to believe that anyone would be enthralled by old squinty eyes. Then, her character is completely ridiculous. Supposedly refined but ready to hop in bed with any male within an arms length.The film does stay on course when Jeffrey Iron's villain is captured for murder and then escapes with the help of two guns-for-hire. The movie completely unravels, however, when Irons receives a presidential pardon (are you kidding me!) and the becomes a refined business man (thereby losing the edge that made him at least somewhat interesting).Appaloosa then simply meanders on pointlessly for the last half an hour until suddenly, Viggo's character decides out of nowhere to engage Irons in a showdown and kills him. I am admittedly unfamiliar with the book which was the source of this movie but I can't believe it made this little sense.Sorry, if you are looking for the next great western, keep on looking.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good viewing in the main, but only a partial success</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Appaloosa is worth viewing - it is a good and solid Western with something akin to a film noir in it (And perhaps this was novelist Robert Parker's intent - he is a crime writer primarily) and it works best when it is just a straight western.It may not be popular but Renée Zellwinger's character is just too unlikely for my money. She is the equivalent of a film noir femme fatale - but lacks the chops to pull that off - so instead we get a confusing message - and I just couldn't buy Ed Harris' moral marshal falling for her - so the film was greatly weakened for me.A great taciturn performance from Viggo Mortensen - totally believable. Somehow Harris seemed to be distracted - perhaps directing and acting was not the right choice here.The film has excellent production values - and stands out, and goes up a grade for the last 20 minutes. The film could easily have ended 20 minutes sooner, but, unlike many Westerns here we get the full conclusion.Overall, watchable, even enjoyable, but its central pillar of the relationship was a little too stretched to make this one of the films of the year.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What an embarrassment for Ed Harris</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I tell you, I've never walked out on a movie before, but I was desperate to walk out on this horrible disaster of a movie.I respect Ed Harris as an actor and I went to see the movie because I am fond of all the people who starred in the film. However, Ed Harris has proved that his understanding of film-making is greatly lacking.This movie had so many scenes that were directed the way a college student just learning the basics might direct. Bad edits, amateur camera angles, and long... long... painful long sequences of meandering dialogue that did nothing for the story except make you wish it would end soon.There were also some scenes where they failed in the sound mixing so you couldn't catch certain lines that might have been funny... but the direction for the actors was just as poor as the technical miscues and failings. The script had scenes that could have been funny if they had been delivered in a form other than FLAT... which was the feel through the whole film... FLAT. All the lines were delivered with dismissive feeling toward the film over all (another reason the movie fails to capture or interest.) The plot was very basic and straight forward, leaving no surprises... and there really seemed to be no sense of consequence for any action. There was no real tension in the film... or real anything (except for the town itself. I do have to give credit that the town and costumes were very realistic... succeeding in making the town looking lived in).I suggest Ed Harris not direct another movie ever again...and I wish I could get my money back...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This film made money??</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I would not normally care if a film made money or not - but I checked the 'mojo' site and it took in 27M against 20M cost. This has to be due to Ms Zellweger's ability to 'open' a film or whatever the jargon is.Being a fan of KID NATION (as I know one of the kids in that reality show) I looked forward (as the youngster was one of the extras) to this western. The 'movie set' town sits outside of Santa Fe where KID NATION was filmed. Anyways...Ed Harris' work as an actor (and director in Pollock is especially noteworthy) has alway been good. Jeremy Irons, ditto. HOWEVER this has to be one of the worst 'westerns' I've sat through in quite a while. The story line is so absolutely predictable as to be comic. The characters with the possible exception of Mr. Irons portrayal of the corrupt rancher, are wooden. Even poor Renee could not rise above the script or the idiotic story line.New Marshall in town with sidekick to 'off' the bothersome bad guys. Ms. Renee arrives to set up business set in 1887; the lonely widow looking for a man. Immediately she finds the new Marshall (and later his sidekick and more - very questionable morales here) and begins to settle down. I don't think she marries the Marshall (Harris) - or, maybe I missed that part? The Marshall does not suffer fools lightly and kills most of them within seconds of introductions - or beats them to a pulp.He manages to get the real, real bad guy - played by Irons. After a speedy trial (one witness for the prosecution and maybe dozens for the defendant) the judge (direct from Central Casting) sentences Irons to death in another town. Off go the Marshall, sidekick and some other central casting types.Oh no... Irons' gang manages to get him back. Oh no... they are holding helpless, man-lovin Renee hostage. You guessed it - Harris catches up with them only to find his beloved bathing naked with the outlaws (and looking like she's having a great time). This is the only twist in this rather bad screenplay - so you'll just have to see it to believe it.Justice is done and thankfully the film concludes with a song by Mr. Harris himself. YUCK!! Okay - the locations (besides the Santa Fe town) are great and captures the real west - not the Monument Valley, stunning sunset scenarios. The often windy, dusty weather of the high desert is appropriate. Costumes, art direction, cinematography is also top rate. HOWEVER, I can only rate it 3/10 mainly because I just love Renee (even though she was awful in this wooden, misdirected film).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A technical faultless film with faults</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I know it's a strange title but please bear with me. Whilst I thought this film has it all it's missing that 'Je ne sais pas'. It's beautifully shot (but I always think it takes a real hack to make scenery like that look bad), well directed, fairly well acted from everyone bar Renee Zellweger who seems slightly one dimensional, the production design was fab, it also has some cracking dialogue and a great score. It looks like a film which has had a lot more than the twenty million dollar budget spent on it and for that my hat goes off to everyone involved in it. BUT (and as you can see it's a very big but!) something just doesn't sit right with it for me. I have a feeling that it's something to do with the lack of background for Ed Harris' character. We know what sort of man he is but I would have like to have know what shaped him into being the man he is. I also think that there wasn't enough time to develop the relationship between the characters played Ed Harris and Renee Zellweger. I don't the scriptwriters Robert Knott and Ed Harris were to blame for this as after reading a few reviews of the original novel it seems that this is also a flaw in the book.As a result I wasn't drawn into the film as much as I want to be. If the characters had a bit more substance to them I would recommend this film to almost anyone but instead I think only true, non-discriminating fans of the Western genre, (a type of film which after not really liking as a kid I have grown to enjoy immensely) will get a kick out of it.I really hope we see more Westerns on the big screen as it would be a shame to let them die out all together.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Coupla white guys sittin' around talking</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some wag once defined an Adult Western as a show where the hero shoots off his mouth instead of his gun. There is enough talking between the **two** heroes of this meandering film for **three** westerns. And when they aren't yakking it up with each other, Ed and Viggo are talking with the town fathers, with the villain (Jeremy Irons), with the love interest (Renee Zellwegger, looking like she's wearing a Japanese Kabuki mask) and sundry other characters.There also is a bit of four-letter profanity, which is fashionable for movies these days but here is entirely gratuitous.The root of the problem is Ed Harris' inexperience as a director. Static scenes of people talking is about the limit of his ability and since this movie was gone from theaters faster than a late night movie crowd, he isn't likely to get much more experience in the director's chair.Nor is the story so original. Henry Fonda played the town tamer with more style in the 1958 **Warlock**.The picture does succeed on a technical level. Costumes and sets look authentic to the last wagon wheel. The gunfire sounds startlingly real. Jeff Beal's musical score is somewhat derivative but catchy, often affecting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great movie, Even with Renee Zellweger</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love that there are still some strong Westerns being made, like 3:10 to Yuma, and I guess we could say There Will Be Blood, or maybe No Country for Old Men, for a different kind of Western. This film had a classic plot that was somehow fresh. The characters were wonderful--Viggo Mortensen's Everett may become one of my all-time favorite "Good Guys." And Ed Harris, though he had his hand in most of the creation of the film, underplayed his part, creating a unique, complex character. All good yes. But I want to make a case for Renee Zellweger, because she has been the complaint of a lot of people. I'm never keen on her acting, or think she's particularly attractive, but the casting here somehow worked. She was annoying, played piano horribly, and I hated her--but this was the character! Of course I wanted her to leave a scene, she was embarrassing! She could have been charming, her flirting could have been cute, but instead Zellweger created this revolting and at the same time desperate and pitiful character. Silent shots of her playing the piano, alone in the room, made her look old, unattractive, frightened, and this made it possible for the audience to empathize with her. Maybe she just lucked into it, but I like to think that Zellweger consciously created this complex character here who was able to hold her own with the other characters in the film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ed Harris directs, produces and co-writes APPALOOSA, a straight-forward, no punches pulled western. Marshall Virgil Cole(Harris)and Deputy Everett Hitch(Viggo Mortensen)have been saddle pals for too long to remember. The pair shoot straight, ask few questions and shrug off feelings...for feelings will get you killed. The pair arrive in the small town of Appaloosa in dusty New Mexico and are hired to protect the town by taking it away from the ruthless and powerful rancher Randall Bragg(Jeremy Irons). Bringing new order to Appaloosa requires Virgil and Everett to take over every aspect of the town and guard against Bragg's gunmen. A stranger arrives in town on the train; an attractive piano-playing young widow Renee Zellweger, who knows how to charm a man...usually the man in control of the current situation. Of course when Marshall Cole asks her if she is a whore...her answer is giggly and demure. The typical and expected good versus bad with Harris as the almost lazy hero compared to the cocky and manic Irons. Also in the cast: Lance Henriksen, Timothy Spall, James Gammon, Boyd Kestner and Luce Rains.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One Of The Best Westerns Of All Time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Appaloosa is a truly great western. It is not overly violent and the scenes of them sitting around talking are far more entertaining than the gunfights that only last a few seconds. Viggo Mortensen puts in an excellent performance as Virgil Cole's 8-guage shotgun toting deputy Everett Hicks. Hicks is conflicted and complex and turns out to be more of a hero in this movie than anyone, including Cole. Ed Harris is also excellent as the brooding Virgil Cole, a lawman who's been doing his job for a very long time. Ed Harris gives the wide range of emotions that is Virgil Cole. At times Cole is steady as a rock and calm. Other times he departs from being cool and turns into a bar room brawler. Rene Zelwiger is good as Ms. French. But it's not her best performance. All the characters are complex and that makes this western one of the best. Nothing is cut and dry except the loyalty Everett Hicks shows to Cole and the love Cole has for Ms. French. The end credits is a real treat as we hear a comical song sung by Ed Harris about Ms. French.Rayvyn</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Appaloosa is the name of the town Virgil Cole (Harris) and Everett Hitch (Mortensen) are hired by the town officials to clean up.Appaloosa is also the name of a breed of horse. One would think that somewhere in the story, a western story out of the days of the old West, mind you, One would see an Appaloosa horse. I mean even though the story isn't about Appaloosa horses and the title of this movie is what it is, One would think One would see an Appaloosa horse. One didn't or One missed it. Pity. This is a good western, not a great one, a good one. The dialogue is such that it wants to give the impression that all gunslinger man-talk isn't all gunslinger man-talk. The banter is conversational, reasonable and okay -- one that shows a softer side. But, don't be fooled, the gunslinger man-talk is still there when it needs to be. In the beginning you see many buildings in the town, but very few people walking around. That's kind of strange for a town that also has a train station. The acting is good all around, but there appears to be some awkward moments in dialogue when Mrs. French (Zellweger) comes to town. Some awkwardness was to be expected, but this was just too awkward, and I couldn't help wondering why the scenes weren't re-shot. This may have been Ed Harris' first attempt at directing. He also had a hand in the writing too. The only other thing besides Mortensen's unnecessary beard (but without the beard, then we would all think Mortensen was the Leading Man and he wasn't, Harris was. See?) was the time-line when Mrs French meets with Virgil and Hitch at breakfast. Practically, the next scene has Mrs. French telling Hitch that she and Virgil are going to buy the new house at the edge of town. There were other time-line moments that happened too quickly but you kind of got used to it. I wouldn't have minded a sub-title saying "6-months later" or some such. Would have made for better continuity. All the above aside, this is still a good western. The pace is a little slow at times, but we don't see many westerns these days and I, for One, tried to savor every second. I could almost smell the leather. Remember Matt Dillon from the TV show Gunsmoke? Guess what breed of horse he rode? What's the title of this movie? Just thought I'd throw that in. HA! Yeah, it's hard for me to let it go. Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: Yes, not much, there are F-bombs</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>boring because the heroes lack a counterpoint</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I spent some time figuring why this movie doesn't work. Its slow and boring, despite some solid performances.The problem is that two of the central characters are weak. Randall Bragg (Jeremy Irons) is the villain. He starts off well by killing three lawmen single handed. After that it's downhill. In succession.* He backs down on facing Virgil Cole when having 4:1 advantage in numbers. * He is captured going to the toilet. * He then backs down again when having the advantage of 10:1. * He escapes (a brief rally but ...) * Is recaptured double quick and his horse is traded by Hitch to the Indians. * Manages to run off again. * Finally is killed by a perfunctory single shot from Hitch having been slapped in the face.Altogether not the most daunting villain. This accounts for why the film seems to lack pace - because Cole and Hitch as a duo are very powerful but have no counterpoint and hence not much purpose. Allie (Zellweger) is simply batted between strong men. So there's not much development there. So you're left with a character study of two lawmen in an empty film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I wanted to like this one a lot...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>...being an admirer of Ed Harris's work over the years, but honestly, I just can't bring myself to call this one a keeper. It's a decent piece of genre entertainment, certainly worth a watch, a worthy notch in Harris's directorial belt, but does it join the ranks of classics like "Red River," "The Unforgiven," or "The Good, The Bad, and the Ugly?" Sadly, no.Based on the novel by the immensely popular mystery writer, Robert B. Parker, with a maiden screenplay by actor Robert "Pollack" Knott and Harris himself (who also produced and directed), "Appaloosa" tells the tale of two professional lawmen/gunslingers (Harris and Viggo "I'm not Aragorn, I just played him" Mortensen) and their efforts to bring justice to a town in late 19th century New Mexico. Those efforts center on delivering a bad man (Jeremy "Damage" Irons) his due, but things get messy (of course) when an opportunistic widow (Renée "Nurse Betty" Zellweger) and then an old nemesis (Lance "Pumpkinhead" Henriksen) show up. Everything is (of course) resolved: the bad guys are punished, the good guys redeemed, the town saved from lawless exploitation, and our hero gets the girl (for what she's worth). Hurrah! Unfortunately, much of this is so generic and plays out so formulaically that it fails to register on a visceral level, possibly because there's so little back story to the characters, back story that I'm fairly sure the novel probably provided. Harris's professional vigilante is mostly unremarkable; it's only his occasional vocabulary difficulties that distinguish him from scores of characters cut from the same cardboard. Zellweger's weak-kneed bimbo suffers from lack of depth as well as a horrendous make-up job that the lady's natural vivacity and appeal simply cannot penetrate. Henriksen is damn near unrecognizable, which may or may not be a good thing, Jeremy Irons seems to be in take-the-paycheck mode, and even Mortensen, whose acting I admire a great deal (along with Harris) has only an oddball beard and an 8-gauge shotgun to distinguish him from the bulk of his resumé of even-tempered leading men. It's not that the dialog is terrible, or even the mostly pedestrian plot. Dean "Dances With Wolves" Semler's camera-work is at times quite gorgeous, and Jeff "Pollock" Beal's score is reasonably evocative and restrained. The production design, art design, costuming, and so on seem nicely attentive to detail and historical veracity and so forth. It's all just...well, another example of Sturgeon's Revelation. In one eye and out the other, which is a shame. It's a shame that so much talent could be so...forgettable.Your mileage, of course, may well vary. "Appaloosa" is still worth a watch, don't get me wrong. Just don't expect anything out of the ordinary, and you won't be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Good, The Bad, and the Botox.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The pairing of Viggo and Ed Harris in this movie was wonderful, with both of these men seemingly walking straight out of the late 1800's, complete with the slow confidence of true gunslingers apparent in their acting. Watching these two stoic modern-day cowboys define their unique relationship throughout the movie is one of the joys of Appaloosa, and where director Harris does his best work. However, some of the scenes do not flow smoothly into each other, with abrupt shifts in the time line or from day to night. This makes it hard to find a comfortable pace for this movie; especially when you come to expect the story line to flow as slow and steady as the steely performances of the leading men. Renee Zellweger is miscast in this role (and in any other period piece IMHO), and one has the feeling of watching a play from the 1800s whenever she enters the screen, instead of watching a movie about the 1800s. I am constantly aware that I am watching a movie whenever she painfully delivers her lines, and some otherwise great dialog is rendered annoying and forgettable by her uncomfortable and uneven performance. Furthermore, evidently Botox was in full supply in Appaloosa, because her perpetually pinched expression is framed by a swollen face, taking her bad performance and making it almost unwatchable, and the only reason i will not add this movie to my library. I'd like to see Harris and Viggo try another western together, this time with a veteran director and a leading lady comfortable in this genre. I'd give it a 7 or 8 had "Mrs. French" not been so miscast (not to kick a dead Appaloosa or anything.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's Watchable, I Suppose</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I guess if you're a fan of Westerns, you'll be more inclined to forgive this movie's many flaws. However, seeing as I enjoy Westerns, but I'm not particularly a fan of them, I didn't forgive a single one of them.From the opening sequence I was thoroughly disappointed with the acting. Everyone except Ed Harris sounded like they were reading from cue cards off screen, so I became annoyed early on and the movie did nothing at all to redeem itself. The story moved along at a snails pace and, except for one part, was very very predictable. Also, for a Western movie, there was very little action. Appaloosa's does have some good points though. The action sequences they did have were brilliant and realistic (which I really appreciated). There were no drawn out gun sequences, they were quick and packed full of shooting, which makes perfect sense, since everyone in the gunfights are supposed to be well trained gunman. And the acting did gradually get better, all the way up until the last few lines, which were, again, delivered like being read from cue cards. Like I said before, if you are a fan of Westerns, you'll probably be a lot more forgiving than I am being, so you should probably go ahead and see this movie. If you're like me, and can enjoy a Western but not particularly a fan, then ignore it. Yeah, it's watchable and you won't feel like you completely wasted your time, but there's a lot of times when you'll be thinking "Okay, someone either needs to get shot or this movie needs to end."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fail...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Movie started off somewhat promising, then Renee's character, Allie, shows up and the movie is over. To begin, man, is she uncomfortable to look at in this movie. To make matters worse, her character is seedy, deceptive, and underhanded. Yet somehow Virgil falls in love with her, as does everybody else for some reason. She proceeds to sleep with anybody she can get her claws into and still the makers of this movie want us to sympathize with and understand this rotten whore of a character. Not that the movie was exceptional to begin with, but it's hard to even focus on anything else once Allie shows up. I've been good enough to summarize the main points of the movie:1. Bragg shoots old marshal and his deputies. 2. Virgil and Everett shoot some of Bragg's men (you won't see any more shooting for quite awhile - that's okay, Renee's character is about to show up, and apparently that's what this movie was really supposed to be about anyway). 3. Allie gets off train. 4. Virgil (and Everett) instantly agog at this vision of loveliness. Whereas earlier Everett and Virgil only talk about manly, westerny things, from here on out they will reflect only on life and love. 5. Virgil, hardened veteran mercenary,turns into goofy, grinning schoolboy. 6. Virgil asks whore if she is a whore. Whore asserts that she most certainly is not. 7. Virgil and whore/liar buy house together. 8. Allie tries to sleep with Everett. 9. Allie gets kidnapped and sleeps with Ring. 10. Allie possibly sleeps with Bragg. 11. Virgil pines for lost whore and vows to rescue her. 12. Allie rescued eventually. 11. Short gunfight between Ring, Bragg, Chappie(?), some other guy, Virgil, and Everett. 12. Everett, apparently the only man in town with his balls still intact, pimp-slaps Bragg and calls him out in the street. Everett has to shoot Bragg because Virgil has turned into a whiny, love-struck pussy. 13. Everett rides off into sunset. What happens to Virgil and the whore? Nobody cares because Everett was the only character in this movie who you were really with from the beginning. Everybody else was lame.All 3 stars go to Viggo.</fullReview>

Several minutes into the story, after a couple of pretty good little actions scenes, Rene shows up and the two heroes just come unglued as she walks around with a tea cup and plays piano.

Had I not been with my family I would have left early to get away from all the uncomfortable, fleeting dialogue. The movie started at a quick pace and faltered soon after. My partner and I sat and predicted each part of the story a half an hour before it actually happened. I had always heard that the book was excellent, but Harris' turn did it no justice. The only bright spot in the entire movie was Viggo Mortensen's performance. He showed why he is one of the better actors in showbiz and looked as if he was the "stallion in the herd." Renee Zelwegger, if you could look at her scrunched face for more than a second, was dull and seemed to struggle with a simple crafty character. I would have expected more from her and am wondering if the cheesy script didn't showcase her talents. All in all, the dialogue killed the movie and the story was altogether boring.

		<shortDescription>Dull western that has potential that it fails to delivers on</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When a small town has its sheriff and deputies murdered (supposedly at the hands of powerful rancher Randall Bragg) it opens the door to lawmen-come-hired-guns Virgil and Everett to take up the positions, setting their own rules and naming their own price in return for peace on the streets. Things start well, or at least as well as a war with Bragg's gang could start but the arrival in town of the pretty (?), young (?) widow Allison French puts a distraction into the life of Virgil and threatens to change how effective he can be in the fight against local crime.The name involved in this film attracted me to it plus the fact that I do quite like westerns as a rule. That a colleague had said negative things about the film didn't put me off as, because he is an action fan, I had just assumed that the film must be more intelligent than being about gun-play and thus he was bored rather than the film being bad. Shortly after watching this film I texted him to let him know he was right because Appaloosa is a roundly poor film that squanders potential in every regard and ends up just being one big long dull snoozefest that does nothing well. The plot allows for several things to happen in terms of relationships, conflicts, action and moral grey areas but it manage to do none of them. The main reason it fails is in the writing. The pieces are all in place but the dialogue is clunky and the characters are never allow to naturally expand.This means that their relationships and actions do not engage even when they actually happen (which is not all the time). This results in the whole film just sort of "happening" without the viewer buying what is happening and therefore not caring what is happening. The blame sadly must be put at Ed Harris' door because he fails to make it work. The delivery has an oddly comic air to it at times which undercuts the drama inherent in the ideas (but not in the script) and serves yet again to limit how much I could care. The actors struggle as a result. Harris and Mortensen have a good presence for the genre but that is all they have ? they cannot make me care and they don't seem to be able to react to anything with any air of realism. Irons is a solid baddie in the classic "black hat" vein but he doesn't have that much to do and the lack of moral complexity or insight in the film makes him feel a little more simplistic than he is. Zellweger is poor and I continue to struggle to see why she continues to get roles in big films ? others have commented on how unattractive she is but to me this is secondary to how weak her performance is.I wanted to like Appaloosa and even as I write this I have been trying to find something positive to say to at least provide some balance. I suppose, at times, it is an OK film but these times are generally when the potential is shown shortly before it becomes missed potential. There are ideas but they are never realised and the whole thing clunks along, boring much more than it interests and increasingly feeling like Ed Harris was just given too much trust with the project.</fullReview>

It astonishes me that the two of them managed to team up to put out such an absolutely dreadful movie - and that Harris could be so front and centre in such a worthless project (producing, directing and writing in addition to starring.) It starts with some potential. A local marshal is murdered trying to arrest the leader of a gang terrorizing the town of Appaloosa in 1882. With nowhere else to turn, the town turns to a renowned lawman named Virgil Cole (Harris) to deal with the situation. And then - it fizzles. You wait for something interesting to happen. And you wait. And you wait. And you wait some more. Every now and then there's a hint that something interesting might be coming. But it doesn't. And it goes on like this for two dreadfully dull hours. My last peeve - how in the world did they make Renee Zellweger look so absolutely awful? Pinch-faced and totally unappealing.

		<fullReview>After seeing previews and being a western film fan I bribed and cajoled my wife into going the see Appaloosa. What a painful experience especially for my wife. This film is so preposterous and everything seems so wooden and slow moving. The western town actually looks like a movie set without any life to it, nothing going on which would represent a living western town.As soon as the train pulls into the station as in most westerns a woman emerges and you know she will be the love interest to the film. There is some action at the beginning of the film just to give you a feeling of who the tough guys are but then they get limp and loose their dangerous edge. In one scene the whole gang gets together to challenge the sheriff so they all bunch up in a small room so the guy with the shotgun will have a better chance in wiping them out with one shot. One of the gang is willing to testify against his murderous boss and comes to the sheriff. So when the boss is arrested he is taken to jail to find the snitch living in the jail. What kind of witness protection is this? Another scene where the good guys are watching the bad dudes and a party of Indians arrives and does not see our hero's hiding in the bushes about 20 ft away. Then, in a lame excuse to get rid of the Indians a hero walks a horse up to 10 braves and after some steely glances the Indians think this is good deal and ride off with the pony. Why didn't the Indians shoot the messenger and take off with two horses? I could go on and on but don't want to spoil it anymore than I have already. All the way home I was reminded of how Mama Mia was an enjoyable movie and why would anyone make a move like this...etc. I could not come up with anything good about this movie and and am not allowed to pick our next film. I did like the hat Ed Harris wore.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had some expectations for this movie, but it didn't take long to figure out that it was complete and utter garbage. Ed Harris is a great actor, but I hope the director Ed Harris, is someone else...Do not go and watch this movie. It has to be the most boring western I've seen since the old John Wayne and Elvis Presley crappers. The story is very choppy, totally without consistency. As someone has previously noted, its almost like its been written by an aspiring teenage filmmaker. Some scenes that are supposed to be serious, comes out like the first read-through of the script, except that they're actually on set wearing costumes. The performances of the actors are very sub-par compared to other films they've done. I watched through the movie only because I didn't pay anything to see it, and im sure glad i didn't.Stop directing, acting, writing, producing your own movies Ed, you're not very good at it. Ed-Harris actually sing in on of the songs in this movie, the tune was pretty good, but the lyrics were almost worse than the movie dialogue.:(.............garbage</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Harris, Mortensen, Irons. How can you go wrong with these great actors? Put them in a movie called Appaloosa.There was no character development, a thin, cliché plot, awful script and the worst acting I've ever seen from these movie giants. Even Renee Zellweger. She's never been a show stopper, but I have a feeling her first cold reading for her first gig was a million times better than her performance in this film.Every scene was painful to watch. In dialogue there is a time and place for "pause," but it almost seemed as if Harris and Mortensen had to stop and remember each line before delivering it.And maybe I'm picky, but I absolutely cannot stand it when the story of a whole movie (serious movies) only goes on because of a ridiculous error of a character. Let me explain, I mean errors like this. . . In the opening scene, the Sheriff and 2 deputies approach Bragg and his men at Bragg's ranch. After the Sheriff tells a deputy to apprehend 2 of the men, Bragg opens fire. He shoot's the Sheriff, then one of the deputies with a lever action rifle. The third lawman is just sitting on his horse pointing his pistol at Bragg waiting to get shot. In this situation the the 3rd lawman would have shot Bragg. He would have been shot by the other men, yes, but there would have been no more Bragg, and no more movie. This scene, that led to the rest of the events of this movie, could have been done 20 different ways so as not to show the deputy sitting there waiting to get shot.If you must see this movie, borrow it from a friend so you don't have to pay for the rental. Maybe Harris will get it done next time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ed Harris should stick to acting.This movie was so boring and so lame and annoying and filled with clichés that my friend and I, ended up fast forwarding after we had seen about 30 minutes. Nothing works here. The acting is wooden (especially from Zellwegger) the dialog is awful (these two "tough" gunmen actually talk about the color of drapes at one point in the movie, what the hell??) And the problem with two friends and one "attractive" woman is never really followed through. So what is the point of showing it at all? Talents like Jeremy Irons, Lance Henriksen and Viggo Mortensen are completely wasted here. Ed Harris looks way too old for his part and he cannot direct himself.The few action-scenes are dull and boring and short. And in the end where there is gonna be a showdown between Mortensen and Irons, it's over before you even noticed what happened.Stay away from this crap and watch Tombstone instead. Even Open Range is better than Appa-loser.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ever wonder what it would look like if someone with no sense of humor made a parody of Westerns? Then this is your film. Harris, normally a fine actor and director of Pollack, gives us a film created entirely our of clichés, quotes from old films, a perfectly unbelievable story, a two-dimensional hero, an irritating, unattractive heroine, a sappy film score, a predictable outcome, a minimalist set, the sudden appearance of 3 or 4 "fucks" in a script that mocks language, and an almost complete diminution and hyper-stereotyping of whatever it was that "the West" or Westerns meant to Americans craving an old-fashioned, if delusional, sense of justice, freedom, and individualism. This would all be forgivable if anything presented here were clever, interesting, daring, original, but the film just sits there with its legs open, depending for life on the vague, nostalgic yearnings of an audience desperate to remember the familiar trappings of an old, treasured genre and a place that once powerfully existed on screen. This is truly no country for old men whose cinematic memories are still intact.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>AWFUL Movie...Such a let down after much anticipation!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Unfortunately, this movie is a BIG let down. I had been looking forward to seeing Appaloosa since I saw the first trailer, but was highly unimpressed by the poor plot line, the rampant clichés, the underdeveloped characters and the overall ridiculousness of the film. While Ed Harris, Viggo Mortensen, and Renee Zellweger are all great actors, this movie fell short in every way imaginable!!! The plot was choppy and poorly written (with exception of a couple witty comments) and the characters were so poorly developed I actually caught myself laughing at what was supposed to be a sentimental part of the film. I could go on and on about this poorly structured movie but the bottom line is it was awful and I would not recommend anyone waist 2 hours of their life by watching it....Sorry Ed Harris.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Very disappointed. All star cast yet a let down. The plot drags on and on at a very slow mosey. Very little action for a western. Definitely not to the caliber of tombstone or unforgiven...having had to watch this is unforgivable. Very slow story line there was a slight yet predictable plot twist. Hopefully you are still awake by this time. A few one liners for a chuckle. Some very interesting characters are introduced played by some extraordinary actors and actress. Sadly these follow the same style as the dull plot line and there characters never really explode to life. Several times you feel like you are watching amateurs reading off a cue card in the back ground. Like a piece of tumbleweed blowing through this thing goes on and on collecting dust along the way. There never is any real wow in this movie. Save both your time and money and see the two previously mentioned.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After listening to the superb audio-book release of Parker's book, I was really expecting something better. And I think it would have been better in somebody's hands other than Harris's. How about a little humor?, a little suspense? a little pacing? Imagine what Sergio Leone or Howard Hawks or even Quentin Tarantino could have done with this story? (Well, recast it entirely for one thing.). Comment ends here.

		<shortDescription>The worst film I've seen this year</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A big stinking pile. It's a very generic Western scenario with a script that sounds like it was written by a teenager with a small vocabulary and little capacity for complex thought, directed by a guy who maybe watched two Monogram Westerns in his life and nothing else and acted by extras from those movies. Which is weird, considering the talent behind all three of these aspects of the picture is Ed Harris, one of the finest actors around. I never saw his directorial debut, Pollack, but you'd think with all the time he's spent behind the camera would have taught him something. The story is about two career lawmen (Harris and Viggo Mortensen) who take over the town of Appaloosa after the sheriff and deputies were gunned down by a local landowner, played by Jeremy Irons. Into Harris' life comes Renée Zellweger, that perpetual ruiner of movies. Fortunately or unfortunately, Appaloosa didn't even need her in it to be ruined. She kind of comes in between the two men, although the plot starts to move forward (finally) before that can entirely happen. I'm not going to go any further into the plot, but it somehow manages to be too simplistic, descending into a scenario similar to 3:10 to Yuma, and too confusing. Zellweger's character is somewhat difficult to understand. I think by the end I got what was happening, but for the longest time I was thinking it was something else entirely. It doesn't help that every character in the movie is utterly blank and bland. A couple of character actors, Timothy Spall and James Gammon, pop up on the sidelines giving us acts we've seen a dozen times before from each of them ? though I do thank them for trying to breathe some life into the movie ? but they are mostly ignored so Harris and Mortensen can sit around with the same aloof look on their faces. Scenes drag on forever, and are often poorly staged. The movie has absolutely no flow. It lies there like a dead fish. This is only the second time I've ever seen a movie in the theater and considered walking out. The worst film I've seen this year.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Somewhat enjoyable, butch cassidy &amp; Wyatt Earp mash-up.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went to the LA premiere of "Appaloosa" tonight. Before the screening an executive described the film to the audience as Ed Harris's vision and introduced Harris as the most obsessive filmmaker he has ever worked with. Thus, I thought Ed Harris was just being humble in telling the crowd, "we made the film for you to enjoy, so enjoy it."The film is somewhat enjoyable. The scenery, sets and costumes are beautiful, the gunplay is fun and the dialogue is funny and even witty at times. Maybe this is what drew such great actors to do the movie.Problem is that when I see Viggo Mortensen character in the movie, I think he would have been a great Doc Holliday. Both the characters and plot feel too familiar. I felt the plots of a Wyatt Earp tale, Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid and an Arthur-Guinevere-Lancelot love triangle were incorporated into this film. Maybe elements of these plots are used here and weaved together somewhat differently, but it was still apparent to me. One scene that is unique in the movie attempts to draw sympathy from the audience for Renée Zellweger's character, but there is no follow up. The motivations for her actions in the film are never explained. Frustrating.I know why Ed Harris told me at the beginning to "...just enjoy..." and I will try not to hold won't hold anything against his movie. As I see it George Clooney and pals like to make heist movies for fun and I don't hold it against them. So why can't Harris, Mortensens, Irons and others make westerns for fun? Well, "Ocean's 11" was officially a re-make, paying homage to the rat pack, which was very enjoyable. They then copied the same formula twice, which weren't so good. So in comparison, Harris in making this movie has skipped the remake and given us "Butch Cassidy...2".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best western since 3:10 to Yuma.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ed Harris does his directing follow-up to Pollock from eight years ago to give us a well-made, enjoyable, yet mediocre western that lacks in several areas but has plenty in others. The cast is very good with Harris and Viggo Mortensen walking and talking slowly and cuddling shotguns the entire time. Renee Zellwegger is also good as the woman who enters their lives and sets off an adventure quite unlike the ones they have experienced before. Jeremy Irons plays the antagonist who unfortunately we don't get to see much of. The play between the two leads is fun and witty, reminding of Paul Newman and Robert Redford in Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. The sets, costumes and photography are also very nice to look at, but in the end there really isn't too much depth to any of these characters nor the story. The climax is also too early in the story and after that, it seems to be just one unnecessary scene after another until the ending finally comes.This isn't to say this is a bad movie in any way, but it won't be winning any Oscars this year and it can't be compared to Clint Eastwood's triumphs. Still, I suppose Harris was just trying to entertain the audience and stay faithful to the book, which I'm sure he was. So, if you love westerns, this one won't shock and amaze, but it won't make you feel regret for using up two hours.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Absolutely horrible</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was defiantly not worth the watch. I loved 3:10 to Yuma for its cinematic beauty and excellent cast of actors, but honestly Viggo is the only actor in this movie I felt was rightly cast. Everyone else just seemed so damn bored. The lead female role was a horrible pick, bad acting, bad to look at, and an overall shitty character to play. honestly this movie drug on for so long with absolutely no point. It got to the point where I could turn to the person I sat next to and say "hey, i bet there going to cut to a shot of the two cowboys riding, and then a shot of the three of them eating together, with some really lame dialogue about getting a house" and that's exactly what would happen. The quick moments of action in this movie were overall useless to the plot, which was virtually non-existent. I left the theater for the first time in my life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Anyone seen Warlock?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is difficult to watch a Western without referencing the many classics of the genre. Appaloosa at first appears to be a poor remake of Edward Dmytryk's Warlock starring Henry Fonda and Anthony Quinn, before it drifts off into the wastes of plagiarism and mediocrity.It takes a special and talented director to take the well-used Western genre and create something original. The Western should be the test that all directors must take to prove they have the chops to deserve the credit of director.Clint Eastwood proved his talent yet again with The Outlaw Josey Wales (1976), Ang Lee succeeded with the classic Ride With The Devil (1999), Andrew Dominik's The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford (2007) had power and atmosphere, even George P. Cosmatos' Tombstone (1993) and Sam Raimi's cheesy homage to Sergio, The Quick and the Dead (1995) had their moments. Appaloosa fails in all departments (but that Viggo Mortensen does look very authentic).First, is the terrible, I mean terrible musical score. It feels as if it was added very late in the game, almost as an after thought! Second, the unimaginative framing, crap lighting, poor focus-pulling and listless cinematography. Third, the turgid script complete with cutting edge profanity. Balls!Fourth, try and remember Claudia Cardinale getting off the train in Once Upon A Time In The West (1969), now compare that with Renée Zellweger getting off the train in Appaloosa! Get my drift stranger?Unfortunately at about this time any faith I had in seeing an enjoyable Western was gone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Misogynistic Western watch for spoilers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Watch for spoilers!!! This movie is the story of two killers turned lawmen to protect the town of Appaloosa from a very bad guy called Braggs. Most of the story line is very predictable. Ed Harris plays Virgil and Viggo Mortensen plays Hitch, the two "heroes". Both look old and ugly but they are good with guns so they are considered "cool" and very macho. Men can be wrinkly and over fifty and nobody picks on them or make fun of their age. As expected a woman appears on the scene (play very blandly by Renee Zellweger). As in any western, women are either damsels in distress or whores. As expected Renee plays the mean opportunistic whore. The rest of the movie is long, predictable and boring. Most of the story is about how this woman ruins the friendship of this two men; How spineless and cowardly she is and how she sleeps with any man in power. This whole movie is sick and misogynistic. So must be the writer of the novel. As for other comments I have read about this movie, obviously they were made by men. The fact that Renee Zellweger doesn't look pretty on this movie has many men angry, or at least making petty, hurtful comments about this woman. Maybe if the producers had cast an 18 year old sexy girl, there wouldn't be so many complains about the character.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Western without an edge</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What's the point in making a western nowadays without a specific edge? I mean Clint Eastwood's efforts are surely edgy, but you don't necessarily have to chose that path or even blaze a new trail.Appaloosa can be seen as a succession of sequences with no inner rhythm. The movie is not a bore but it never gains momentum: each sequence is rather independent from the rest. The main problem can be traced down to the tone. Trying at the same time to cash in on hard-edged gunslingers and likable cowboys-next-door characters, the storyline never bridges that enormous gap. Because there should never be such a gap in the first place.OK characters have to be more than single-dimensional badasses or bronze hero statues with a sharp look, but it's about psychological contradictions or self-deprecating humor for instance, not just playing jokes along with serious stuff. This approach would be OK in a comedy since you want to mock each and every serious stance. Now if you're going to tell a story of a city Marshall going after a villain without the Marx Brothers spirit interfering it better be a good thriller first.I find no reason to be kind in my judgment on Appaloosa for it's not even an original story. Adapting a book may not be an easy matter yet most of the story/structure/characters are there for the screenwriter(s) to pick and go. If the screenwriter has a poor imagination at least he can show he is technically very good at putting others' ideas together.When the voice-over narration that opened the movie comes back just before the end credits roll, you can't but say to yourself those words that came up to your mind after every sequence: 'So what?'</fullReview>
