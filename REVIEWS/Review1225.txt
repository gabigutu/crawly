		<shortDescription>A must see.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Plain and simple - all the negative comments here are from people that simply haven't seen it. See the movie before you try to disprove points that it's not trying to make. See the movie even if you think the globe is in a cooling pattern for some reason (then you can debate the evidence it lays out before you.) I for one have seen it, and it serves not as a political soapbox, but simply a filmed version of a presentation which Gore has been giving since for over 20 years - only to pick up where he left off after conceding the last election.The film is a call to arms for us to fix a fixable problem, explaining the few things each individual can do to bring CO2 levels back down to where they were pre-1970's - On a whole - the film views a little like a college lecture, because it essentially is one. But the topic discussed is imperative.Don't get bogged down by anyone trying to turn the film into a political issue. It's a right or wrong issue, plain and simple.Just the facts ma'am.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Frightening realizations and insightful discussion -- Best movie I've seen in last year</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just got out of a sneak preview of this film, and I must say that it is the best movie I've seen in the last year. Go see it!Whether you're a fan of Al Gore or not, he isn't really the issue here. He does a great job presenting the various forms of overwhelming evidence for global warming and mankind's link to it, but he doesn't do it in a political or spiteful way. He shows global temperature and atmospheric carbon patterns, and he shows that our last 20 years have been the highest by a longshot over the previous 600,000 years. Frankly, before seeing the film, I'd heard a lot of information about global warming being a myth, but this film dispels that notion with many independent pieces of evidence.Even more importantly, it goes to show why we should care that global warming is occurring. As you may have seen in the trailer, if global warming continues at its current rate, the earth's coastlines will be flooded displacing tens of millions of people, it will increase the strength and frequency of hurricanes and tornadoes, it will irrevocably kill off many of the worlds glaciers, it will dry up lands interior to the coastline (like our heartland), and it will disrupt/kill species after species from polar bears to birds. These changes could occur in as short a time as ten to fifty years from NOW.Lastly, he finishes with ways in which we can affect a change. It would be easy to see this film, get depressed about all the state of affairs, and throw up one's hands in despair, but the film offers us ways, big and small, to help reverse global warming's effects right now.I urge you to see this film, you will not regret it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>... If you do not, and you have grandchildren, you should explain to them why you decided not to." - Roger EbertAfter the closing credits to An Inconvenient Truth rolled, I walked out to my car in the theater's parking lot. LA's infamous haze hung low, crimson in the twilight. In the foreground a solitary grasshopper pump drew up oil that had laid dormant for hundreds of millions of years. If Supersize Me made the prospect of a Big Mac and fries a little less appealing, imagine the feeling of slipping into a six cylinder car for a three mile trip home. Just the same, An Inconvenient Truth is not about blame. It's also not only about the problems that global warming poses. Instead, it sets aside the matter of "who's fault is it" and leaves the viewer with the desire to ask and answer the question of "what can I do?" The film (and companion website) does not fail to deliver: both offer practicable steps to take regarding the literal sea change facing the planet. The movie presents evidence that, to me, was quite compelling. Is it incontrovertible? Not being an environmental scientist, I couldn't say. But it's telling that out of almost 1000 peer reviewed scientific journals the film examines on the topic of global warming, the matter was not questioned by one (though doubted in more than half of the popular literature written during the same time). It's also worth mentioning that while Al Gore hosts the film, this movie is not about him. And while he may have showed up for some six years ago as stiff and stodgy, in this context he is masterful in blending the informative with the entertaining. Go see the film for yourself. Bring a friend. Trust me, you'll be glad to have carpooled.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Is Al Gore is doing a Chicken Little act in "An Inconvenient Truth"? I wish he were. This stunning documentary about global warming is a well-reasoned, clearly-proved, intelligent, cogent, irresistible torrent of scientific data, in a curiously warm, engaging, often funny presentation. What an entertaining horror movie this is! Unexpectedly, improbably, Gore is doing a Hitchcock act here, all affable and chummy... before scaring the hell out of the audience. And that he does, with charts, statistics, projections coming from hundreds of peer-reviewed studies, none challenged, while allowing how some 50% of mass-media treatment of global warming *is* subject to questions. There is even a cute animation segment about exaggerated global-warming claims.There is no need to exaggerate. Unchallenged studies are showing an extraordinary rise in ocean temperatures, the disappearance of glaciers, the melting of the poles - and then Gore twists the knife with a series of graphics showing areas to be inundated by rising waters. In a flooded Manhattan of the future, Gore says, the site of the World Trade Center will be under water. "Terrorism," he says, without drama or overemphasis, "is not the only danger we must face." The threatened catastrophe is not in the distant future. The US Geological Survey predicts that by 2030, Glacier National Park will have no glaciers left. In the last 30 years, 400,00 square miles of Arctic sea ice have melted; polar bears today drown when they cannot find an ice floe to rest on. What has Congress done about global warming? Absolutely nothing.Davis Guggenheim's documentary is based mostly on Gore's multimedia presentation on climate change, a lecture he has delivered hundreds of times in recent months. While Gore is managing the show with powerful efficiency, there is nothing dry or tired about it. The film is virtually flawless, even some of the cornier visuals fit in. Gore's personal remarks are affecting: the death of his sister from lung cancer, after lifelong smoking, forced the family - after generations of tobacco-growing in Tennessee - to quit the business. No overt statement is heard, but there is an inevitable comparison with the world's addiction to many activities directly contributing to climate change.Political references are at a minimum. The only strong criticism of the Bush presidency is in the context of the Republican rejection of the Kyoto Treaty, making the US one of two countries in the world to do so (Australia is the other one). Following a huge list of countries paying at least lip service to the cause of climate control under the treaty, Gore shows a similarly large list of US cities where local government is taking measures not supported by Washington.Gore is clear about the danger of being overwhelmed by the danger of what's happening, and he concludes the film by saying that going from denial to despair without pausing to see what can be done is the wrong course of action, or rather inaction. "Political will," Gore says, "is a renewable resource." Gently, but firmly, he calls for attention to a clear and present danger that cannot be ignored... even if faith-based denial of the evidence before us remains largely the order of the day, with all the comfort of darkness behind closed eyes.

		<shortDescription>30 minutes each of self promotion, fear mongering, and interesting, but poorly interpreted, data.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me start by saying that energy conservation and incentives to stop pollution are A Good Thing.Too bad the film isn't about that topic until the final credits are rolling.Al Gore is on a mission; however, it's not to save the environment. He's on a mission to get elected president. He says he's retired, and opens with a comment of how he used to be the next president of the United States and continuously makes comments about his opponents administration. His tactics are scaring us into believing that he will save us; however, he doesn't even acknowledge the one technology that would actually reduce carbon emissions (nuclear power), except for showing the bomb. Okay, first, about the 'facts': -The graph of the 300,000 years of carbon dioxide and temperatures. Brilliant data, poorly interpreted. Gore smugly states the obvious 'fact' that the changing carbon dioxide is what changed the temperatures over the seven ice ages. He does not mention the possibility, or probability, that the changing ocean temperatures affected the gaseous solubility of the carbon dioxide in the ocean water and resulted in varied CO2 concentrations. Read that carefully, it is just as likely the temperature change over the known history caused a change in CO2, not the reverse.Then he gets on a scissor lift to show the change in CO2 spiraling out of control, without acknowledging the zero of the concentration axis would be ten feet below the floor.-The 'hockey stick' graph--Gore neglects to mention that the authors of that figure did not release their methods for analysis, nor did they release the raw data to others for critical analysis. Subsequent analysis had shown the data are sharply skewed to reflect a stronger contribution from recent temperatures.Then there were tons of pictures showing the earth is getting warmer by the melting (see how beautiful they are) glaciers; however, there are no timestamps on them showing what season they are. Maybe they are permanently iced, maybe they aren'tThen he tugs on heartstrings. He shows pictures of the Antarctic glaciers melting, and follows up with a CGI polar bear swimming and drowning. Then he shows the World Trade Center memorial being flooded from Greenland ice melting. He barely acknowledges that those are absolute worst case scenario predictions.It is probable that the global temperature is increasing, just like the temperatures increased before all of the other ice ages. And, it's true that the CO2 is increasing at this moment. Those are facts, but as I have seen dozens of times in my career as a chemical engineer, two variables trending does not define the dependence of one on the other, nor if there is a dependence, it does not define which variable is dependent.In short, Gore oversimplified a global phenomenon that he does not understand, and tried to scare the world. If, because of this film, people drive slower and use less electricity, then the effect of the film is not bad overall, but to make those statements with such ignorant smugness is irresponsible.That's why I gave it 5 out of 10 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good film overall, but there are a few problems</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought that this was on the whole a good film - I can imagine it being an EXCELLENT film for teachers to show to a class to explain global warming, actually. It explains the facts very well, explains away the objections that people have been hearing about from the media, and is also pretty funny at times. The film basically consists of a tour of Al Gore's climate change speeches around the world. It is, in essence, one long speech in various cities around the world (Al Gore says that he's given this presentation thousands of times), inter-cut with some various other footage. The film starts off with a few diagrams that many of you will probably have seen already, as well as a rather famous Futurama clip. In fact, if you're well-versed in your science, you'll probably already know much of what Al Gore talks about (though probably not quite all) - this film is really for the general public who doesn't quite know all of this, and also for those who might have heard something about global warming here and there but want to see exactly how all of the facts fit together.As I said, a very good educational film. The problems come in the short but noticeable periods when the film tries to be a biography of Al Gore at the same time. Now, I don't know about you, but I was watching this to find out about global warming, not to find out what Al Gore thought about losing the 2000 election. I imagine that these are the bits that teachers will fast-forward over when they show this to their classes, since they don't really add anything to the film. I would have respected Al Gore a bit more if he hadn't tried to make this a film also (in a way) about himself. I guess it's to be expected, since he's a politician, but it's disappointing.In closing, although it's not a perfect film, it's a pretty good one. It is THE film to watch if you want to find out about global warming (at least, I haven't heard of any better films out there). I don't really understand all of the "10" or "1" ratings on IMDb. It's not a "10" or "1" film. Even its biggest fans will have to admit that as a movie it could be a little tighter sometimes. I think it's good enough, but it's not perfect.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good, but flawed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before seeing this movie I thought that it might sway the debate on global warming. I assumed that the entire movie was going to be about global warming, and if it had been it would have been much more effective. While about two-thirds of it is about global warming, the other third is a promo for Al Gore--including footage of the contentious 2000 presidential election. As someone who is deeply concerned about the issue of global warming, I am disappointed because I think this diversion from the ostensible subject of the movie makes it much less effective as rhetoric. It has the immediate effect of alienating any republicans that may be in the audience, and global warming should not be seen as a partisan issue, or nothing will ever get done. I'm afraid that because of this the movie will mostly be "preaching to the choir." It still may be an effective tool for educating democrats that were previously uninformed on global warming. As a doctoral student in climate science, I can say that Gore mostly gets the science right, although he weakens the presentation by not pointing out which things are still open to debate.</fullReview>

Who are the 'friends' and 'small groups of scientists' that gathered this data? - What's up with all the Al Gore biography going on there? Like how he liked playing with the cows on the ranch or that his kid got hit by a car.. too bad but.. what does that have to do with the ozone layer?I've seen MUCH better stuff, in much less time, on Discovery Channel.. I really don't understand why this has such a high score on IMDb. Unless you've been living under a rock, this 'documentary' shouldn't be any news to you... all this is old news... And all Al Gore is trying to do is get some popularity points. P.S. i'm not American so don't even try saying that i'm a bush fan :p</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is an aspect of Environmental Science 101 that everyone should learn. If you aren't big into charts and graphs, you may have a hard time sitting still by the end of the film, but that's the point. Cold, hard facts.Overall, a documentary worth seeing. The bits of animation are cute and eye-catching, and Gore's humor is appropriately dispersed throughout. I could have done without the Melissa Etheridge song at the end.This isn't some platform Gore picked up in the last few years; this is something he has been fighting for his whole life, which gives him a credible and reliable voice in this issue and documentary. The best thing about Gore in this film is that he's straightforward without being blatantly alarmist, which is a welcome change from Moore.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hard Science versus belief and consensus</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Something very strange happens when you talk about Global Warming: science goes out the window and "belief" and "consensus" becomes the topic of discussion.It's because of that fact that I give a failing mark to Al Gore's documentary.Instead of promoting intelligent discussion, he kept the debate at the level of "belief" and "consensus".Of course, when you're trying to sell the world into spending trillions of dollars to "stop Global Warming" you may thing it's a problem to tell the scientific truth: we don't know how much of the current warming was caused by humans. Maybe none of it, maybe some of it, or maybe it has over-ceded the next Ice Age and we got really lucky not to have boiled the planet.But the fact remains that we don't know.so we're asked to "believe" in the "consensus". Never mind that any scientist that strays from the "consensus" is ostracized. Never mind that scientific inquiry is about straying from the consensus. Einstein didn't "believe" in the consensus, neither did Copernicus or Galileo.So why so much scorn placed on those very researchers who would advance the field by asking the tough questions? If Global Warming is so incontrovertible, surely a few people testing that theory can't be so threatening.What is going on here? That's the movie I was hoping Al Gore would have made. Istead, he chose to shore up his support with the true "believers" of the "consensus".Sad, really.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An extremely flawed piece of non-sensible propaganda</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let's be honest shall we? Al Gore no more TRULY cares about the environment than most folks care about contacting foot fungus. It's a hook! Make no mistake, Al Gore is a POLITICIAN! Three years ago he was busted/ticketed in his home state doing 70 mph in a 55 mph zone driving NOT a hybrid, a Yugo, or even a Geo Metro but a LINCOLN (go google it if you like)! Or how about the fact that Mr. Gore &amp; his Hollywood buddies continue to use private fuel-guzzling jets to attend the premiers of "An Inconvenient Truth." Not to mention his house in Tennessee yearly uses as much power as 20 average homes do. So much for conservation huh, Al? Anyway, it takes a mere minute to subjectively look at "An Inconvenient Truth" &amp; discover the main fundamental flaw. While the film parades out many seemingly impressive scientists to tell the audience the EFFECTS of supposed "global Warming" there is not one scientist to tell us with ANY degree of certainty the supposed CAUSE of it. For example: I can take a hundred folks out to a parking lot &amp; they can point out an automobile which is not running right. BUT can they tell you with any degree of certainty WHY? Generally not! A second flaw, just how accurate were the weather instruments 100 years ago (the toilet wasn't even invented yet)? What did they have, a June bug in a match box? Hell, even 50-60 years ago? Therefore, how do we know with ANY degree of confidence that the planet is "getting warmer" when the records of yesteryear are highly questionable at best? Or that man is THE sole cause of it? The answer is we don't &amp; Science is NEVER a consensus. Forty years ago, Newsweek Magazine did a cover proclaiming a "New Ice Age". The real truth is that any 6th grade science teacher well versed in Earth Science will tell you that Volcanic Eruptions, Solar Activity &amp; El Ninos have more to do with our eradicate changes in climate conditions than supposed "Global Warming." Finally, what Al Gore fails to adequately address is; even IF America decides to follow the global gospel according to Al &amp; implement everything he recommends, how are we going to get the rest of the world to follow suit when we can't even get them to agree on something so obvious as terrorism? Answer: It's wishful thinking, Mr. Gore &amp; you being a former VP of the USA know it! If the folks who produced "An Inconvenient Truth" were really honest, they would have titled their film "Al Gore Wants Attention." But what I'd really like is for someone to ask the former VP this; why were two of the planet's biggest polluters (AKA China &amp; India) EXEMPT from abiding by the Kyoto Accords? Finally, in the winters of 2009-2011 with 49 out of 50 states experiencing record cold temperatures &amp; Las Vegas getting 6 inches of snow, how is that "Global warming?". Now there is the real "Inconvenient Truth" for Mr. Gore &amp; company. Well that &amp; the fact, that it's now public knowledge that the scientists proclaiming global warming were caught red handed suppressing contradictory data &amp; fudging the numbers. Time to find a new gig, Al!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Same Meandering propaganda from Elites</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An Inconvenient Truth is as entirely simplistic and demagogic as the turgid slop created by the rabid and idiotic Republicans, it meanders along intangible lines until it attempts to gorge something into your face, namely that we'll all be dead in a few hundred years, which is already indisputable, but who cares, humans are selfish, destructive creatures, I frankly do not waste my time caring about human extinction. I'll just call it a "natural progression". Let the apocalypse begin, but meanwhile, we have to listen to the same brazen, slanted politicians who propose another "new society", well, don't be fooled, we'll all still be controlled by the wealthy, by those in power and by those idiots who created the catastrophes in the first place. Nothing will ever change.Al Gore, whose hypocrisy is quite evident in the film, as he is being driven in a gas guzzling car all alone using a consumerist computer, he also lives on huge acres of land in a rather large mansion, the land itself was used for destructive erosive purposes including cattle, tobacco, pig farming (which accounts for methane gas traces) and who knows what else, his wealth is predicated on exploitation, greed and his investments include numerous large companies in the world with disputable records. I hardly think this man is qualified to lecture the less fortunate, but his prestige is based on his opposition to another ludicrous political party, that is all, meanwhile he emits those very same rancid characteristics that make politics and politicians so appalling. This bozo happens to be living the comfortable life and yet he's lecturing poor people in Africa about crop farming and cut and burn techniques? He travels across the world in first class seats in fuel wasting jets, uses product placed computers in the documentary, and yet he thinks everything is a "moral issue". He's entirely absorbed in his own deluded nightmares, he says he came to these conclusions because of the death of his sister (from tobacco induced cancer and the near death of his son by an automobile of all things). Did he fight against the tobacco companies or propose that automobiles be banned because they are dangerous hulking machines? NO. Everything must serve the "economy", so why is he any different, the answer is he is not.His forlorn and exhausted attempts at humanistic philosophy are disastrous, all this while he's being filmed in the forest or along a little river eschewing stale life affirming quotes. Well Mr Gore, why don't you try living like the common people then? He is a politician, plain and simple, he has a career invested in the power structure. My question is, why doesn't he concentrate on the powerful industrial nations of the earth who are to blame for most of the complications? He doesn't do that because it would be unwise for "investments, stocks and corporations".Al Gore gives monotonous lectures about the subject in the documentary, namely to wealthy white people in the audience, who clap on cue, while showing them graph charts, numbers and percentages, and speaking in a dreary tone, no one without a Harvard (which the elites control) education can make sense out of it, but he tells us everything is going to hell. No kidding, but I think he fails to account for this problem precisely in the approach that capitalism has taken for the planet, namely that it is expendable and a waste dump. He never once mentions how industrialization has created these problems, he just wants to put mild bandages on them but not eradicate the whole oppressive system. Its obvious he was spoiled, sent to the schools for elites and has the same basic temperament for politics as any other back stabbing, inconsistent dullard in Washington. Whoever made this propaganda, as it is in no way different than what the Republicans have conceived, had only goals in mind that were directed by capitalistic impulse. That is to say, someone is going to benefit, and it seems the "new green" politicians who support venture capitalist companies who are buying up hordes of land in an attempt to develop the "new Utopian future" with "new technologies". It's the same old story, Al Gore is a believer in the elitist structure, he actually believes there is a "democracy" in the US which I find very naive. If we aren't paying wages to the oil companies, then we'll be paying them to the wind and solar companies.I find the speech at the end quite rancid, along the lines of something GW Bush would have oozed over to the dumb downed masses, Gore speaks about "people uniting together to defeat communism" in the 1990's, what it had to do with global warming, absolutely nothing but he attempts to get base emotions ruminating in people. With that said, he didn't understand that communism never existed in the world, the systems in Europe and USSR were merely a tyrannical form of authoritarianism and capitalism, no less different than what controls the US interests. Social ecology was not even mentioned here, which is really a travesty. If you want to change the world, then one must dispose of those antiquated systems that are based on greed, exploitation and violence.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Don't drink the cool-aid.This is an opinion piece disguised as a documentary. And to title it as a "truth" is just plain crap. The debate over global warming is far from over, and will only be over when the eco-zombies start acknowledging the mountain of evidence contrary to their beloved theory. Just Google "Global Warming" and "Hoax" or "Junk Science" and you will find a river of information refuting nearly every link in the chain of logic that Gore sites. The reason it is so important for people to educate themselves is the disastrous economic impact that global warming prevention measures would have. Wake up people. Anyone with a computer, a little time, and some common sense can find many many reasons why this theory is not even close to credible. Don't just read articles that support your present opinions, read everything you can find. There is no in-depth analysis to make, really. There is simply too many alternate possibilities and counter-evidence for the theory to have even the most basic level of scientific credibility. It is so uncredible, in fact, that it may be the single biggest hoax in the course of human existence. It's time for people to start speaking out against this kind of propaganda, and it's time for people to admit to themselves and others that you can be a both a conservationist AND recognize the glaring conclusion that global warming hysteria is a big lie.</fullReview>

Oh I forgot about the 8 years he was the 2nd in command of the most Powerful nation on Earth. The film is happy to show shots of a young Senator Gore asking why a NASA scientist was forced to change a conclusion in his scientific paper, but fails to ask about the complicity of Clinton/Gore in global warming. Probably too close to an election year, or maybe it would hurt the chances for Hillary in '08. Either way he's a political coward and party man to the bitter end. He offers no criticism of consumerism, no criticism of capitalism, no way to is the history of the industrial development which has led us to this point in time In the end this film was much more about Mr. Gore himself than about any real problems our environment faces. Mr. Gore if you really wanted to make a campaign film - shorten it &amp; call it what it really is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a slick selling job by a formidable used car salesman (who happens to be an ex-VP). I won't go into the details here, but the conclusions by scientists today are far from conclusive as would be indicated by this film. If you are interested in obtaining information and facts regarding the other side of this issue, may I suggest the book "State of Fear" by Michael Creighton (of Jurassic Park fame). This movie is a slick selling job to whip the viewers into a "state of fear".And the pro-environmentalist/alarmist talking points are well distributed in the postings in this "review" section of IMDb. As far as the cause of (and for that matter, the danger of) Global Warming, the jury is still out and the majority of the scientific community is not in agreement on this issue. This movie brings to mind one of H. L. Mencken's more profound observations."The whole aim of practical politics is to keep the populace alarmed by menacing it with an endless series of hobgoblins, all of them imaginary." H. L. MenckenAnd what better way to keep the populace "alarmed" then by having an ex-VP attempt to sell us this bill of goods.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Truth - Inconvenient Even for Gore</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I honestly went into this movie thinking - well, maybe there is something I could learn about Global Warming...and after I left, I have to say I was a bit skeptical about Gores claimed "complete" support by the scientific community.If you're going to go to this movie thinking it is the hands-down "word" on what to believe about global warming.. please keep in mind that this movie has nowhere NEAR widespread support within the scientific community. To quote a few of the people against the movie: Professor Bob Carter, of the Marine Geophysical Laboratory at James Cook University in Australia, on Gore's film: "Gore's circumstantial arguments are so weak that they are pathetic. It is simply incredible that they, and his film, are commanding public attention." "The man is an embarrassment to US science and its many fine practitioners, a lot of whom know (but feel unable to state publicly) that his propaganda crusade is mostly based on junk science." ? Bob Carter as quoted in the Canadian Free Press, June 12, 2006 Richard S. Lindzen, the Alfred P. Sloan Professor of Atmospheric Science at MIT, wrote: "A general characteristic of Mr. Gore's approach is to assiduously ignore the fact that the earth and its climate are dynamic; they are always changing even without any external forcing. To treat all change as something to fear is bad enough; to do so in order to exploit that fear is much worse." - Lindzen wrote in an op-ed in the June 26, 2006 Wall Street Journal Gore's film also cites a review of scientific literature by the journal Science which claimed 100% consensus on global warming, but Lindzen pointed out the study was flat out incorrect."?A study in the journal Science by the social scientist Nancy Oreskes claimed that a search of the ISI Web of Knowledge Database for the years 1993 to 2003 under the key words "global climate change" produced 928 articles, all of whose abstracts supported what she referred to as the consensus view. A British social scientist, Benny Peiser, checked her procedure and found that only 913 of the 928 articles had abstracts at all, and that only 13 of the remaining 913 explicitly endorsed the so-called consensus view. Several actually opposed it."- Lindzen wrote in an op-ed in the June 26, 2006 Wall Street Journal.Roy Spencer, principal research scientist for the University of Alabama in Huntsville, wrote an open letter to Gore criticizing his presentation of climate science in the film: "?Temperature measurements in the arctic suggest that it was just as warm there in the 1930's...before most greenhouse gas emissions. Don't you ever wonder whether sea ice concentrations back then were low, too?"- Roy Spencer wrote in a May 25, 2006 column.Former University of Winnipeg climatology professor Dr. Tim Ball reacted to Gore's claim that there has been a sharp drop-off in the thickness of the Arctic ice cap since 1970."The survey that Gore cites was a single transect across one part of the Arctic basin in the month of October during the 1960s when we were in the middle of the cooling period. The 1990 runs were done in the warmer month of September, using a wholly different technology," ?Tim Ball said, according to the Canadian Free Press.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bullying = Concensus?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Something that really does not go down right with Al Gore (and his supporters)'s theory is the whole thing about "concensus".If there were such a consensus, why is it that the "believers" in the almighty global warming feel the irrepressible need to try and bully anyone who questions them.Why is it that anyone who does not toe the line on global warming is met with smug accusations of being either stupid or on the payroll of the oil companies (apparently being a professional global warming researcher does not mean you're on anyone's payroll in that wondrous world...) Why is there such a need to tell everyone how the whole question is settled, when it is the very nature of science to honestly question assumptions? For some ideas on the answer to those questions, read Prey by the well-know oil-stooge Michael Crichton... oh wait, he is rich and not on the payroll of the oil companies. He just took a huge career risk in not toeing the line of the Greens and other Kyoto worshippers and told the truth as he researched it. By the way did you know that abiding to the Kyoto protocol would result in almost no lowering of temperatures, according to its own backers? Just a few questions that Al Gore made sure to stay away from lest he not get every penny of the environmental lobby in case he decides to run again.So who's a stooge..?</fullReview>

Also, that the average temperature of the earth has only raised .01 percent in the last 100 years still means we are in a global warming? Yeah...right, and I invented the internet. The earth goes into cycles of warming up and cooling down, these are things called like the ice age. Yeah, ice age...bet you've heard of that. Well, we are about 1,000 years late for this planets next ice age, and the earth actually does get warmer right before an ice age...Al Gore is an idiot and should not be taken seriously.

		<fullReview>A hint I think may be gathered by the various comments on this thread.I was quite amazed at the number of people who liked this film who want to make it "mandatory" or "compulsory".I think this gives us a little bit of insight into the reason this film and the issue underlying it is so polarizing.The Global Warming issue appeals a lot to people who want to force others to "do right". It appeals particularly to more "liberal" leaning people because it doesn't have to do with bedroom morality which is what usually gets conservatives who want to force you to "be good" going.And that's the problem with the film. Al Gore is a politician. And a very successful one at that. He just can't help himself from appealing to those people who want to force others to do as they would. The political appeal is just too great.And there we are left with a scientific issue that may be of huge importance, reduced to a political issue appealing to those in the body politic with a predilection to force other to "do right".Another interesting question is how did the Environmental movement get hijacked by such people?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great documentary that is a must see, especially for all Americans</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I got to see this at Sundance. Sometimes there are documentaries that have been accused of not being straightforward or factual, but this is not one of them. It's very fact based. It had some funny and touching moments, but they were never done at the expense of the integrity of the film. It's very science based but presented in a fascinating way (I have no science background). It was also done on a technical level that was superb. The situation presented on global warming is unsettling, but I appreciate that the filmmakers do end it with some hope. I gave it a 9/10, instead of a 10, because Al Gore (although I respect him more than ever after seeing this) is presented as a lone warrior type in trying to get the message out. I would've liked to have seen a more accurate portrayal of the community of people-- scientists, religious leaders, teachers, etc...-- who speak out for change every day. Still, it alone was worth the trip to Utah.</fullReview>

There is science and there is faith. both are fine by me, but you should not have to "believe" in a scientific theory.By its very name, a scientific theory is something that needs to be evaluated from every angle, contested and tested yet again. That's the essence of science, and it is disheartening to see science being hijacked by people that want you to "believe".I was hoping this film would help foster an intelligent discussion but all it has fostered is a wave of people saying that you have to "believe", and that is the worst thing that has happened to science in a long time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Film overdoses on too much Al</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Regardless of how you feel about Al Gore as a politician, this documentary is worth seeing because of the gravity of the issues discussed. Gore proves to be a worthy spokesman and his arguments are clear and concise at the beginning of the film. In other words, you do not need to be a scientist to understand what he is saying about the environment and the consequences of global warming. He is an effective communicator and good at explaining the problem in layperson's terms.The problem with the film is, ironically, too much of Al Gore himself. Less than halfway through I began to ask myself "Is this a documentary about global warming or about Al Gore?" There is a shift from the message to the messenger; global warming fades into the background while Al moves to the front and center. While a brief personal portrait (family background, political career) could have enhanced the story, in this documentary the focus on Gore dilutes the film's central theme.Towards the end, Gore's examples become slightly disjointed as he tries to "throw too much into the bag" (ex: overpopulation). I blame this more on the editing of the film than on his live presentations (people have criticized the movie as being "about a slideshow", but seeing the film made me want to attend one of Mr. Gore's presentations in person!). Thankfully, "An Inconvenient Truth" ends on a positive note. That alone makes this documentary recommended viewing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What are Al Gore's credentials anyway????</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is nothing more than unscientific propaganda. I've come to the conclusion that Al Gore is either the smartest man who has ever lived or the dumbest - and I'm guessing its the latter. Let's review Big Al's credentials (it shouldn't take long). He went to Harvard University, receiving a degree in GOVERNMENT. Not science, GOVERNMENT. He later went to Law and Divinity school (maybe he can be a Reverend also). How does this qualify him to be an expert on Global Warming? He eventually was elected to the House of Representatives and the Senate, finding time to invent the internet and put PARENTAL ADVISORY stickers on music cassettes and CDs (by the way, aren't liberals really into Freedom of Speech, and didn't these labels limit that?). Anyway, now he is the world's spokesman on Global Warming, which really hasn't been conclusively proved by anyone. His career has been one pathetic attempt after another to make himself relevant, against all odds, and this is just his latest attempt to continue that doomed quest. This film is nothing more than speculation and propaganda, nothing more, nothing less. Al doesn't even practice what he preaches, thinking nothing of flying off in a private jet, to tell the masses how dangerous it is to put dangerous gases into the atmosphere (like the massive amounts that spew out of his private jets), and how we should all stem the tide of global warming. And what about his giant mansion in Tennessee? He is an energy glutton, consuming more than 20 TIMES the energy that the average household uses per year. The average household in America consumes 10,656 kilowatt-hours (kWh) per year, according to the Department of Energy. In 2006, Gore devoured nearly 221,000 kWh?more than 20 times the national average. How does he justify that? Hmm...sounds a bit hypocritical if you ask me. And just what did Al do to remedy this so-called crisis during his tenure in congress, and during the 8 years he was second in command of the most powerful country on earth? The first 2 years of the Clinton Presidency the democrats controlled both houses of Congress, yet nothing was ever done. During the last 6 years, nothing was even attempted. If this was such a crisis, why didn't Al use his power to save us all?? By the way, the average temperature of the earth has only increased less than 1 degree in the last 100 years - oh the humanity! I'm writing this from the Northeast U.S., where we have had one of the coldest, snowiest winters ever. Doesn't feel like it's "warming" up here anytime soon. Avoid this movie, unless you want a good laugh, or if you cannot think for yourself......</fullReview>

Essentially his plan is for YOU to send HIM money to buy carbon credits, so he can continue his life style while YOU are supposed to start living like, well like you were back in the stone age.This movie is to Global Warming what Refer Madness was to Marijuana.

And although i agree with using less fossil fuels.. and with the general idea that we should be more responsible for our actions, lieing isn't the way to about it, even worse.. he claims we can fix this.. that it's our fault so we can fix this.. so instead of worrying about what to do if it goes wrong, he focuses on stopping it from going wrong. While in my eyes, it's gonna get a whole lot worse, and if we can't handle a million refugees, we are gonna have to hurry and learn how to handle them, cause there are gonna be a lot of them, whether it's our fault or not.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let me qualify... I voted for Al Gore, usually vote (but don't consider myself) Democrat, and believe that global warming, as well as energy conservation/alternate energy, are probably the top issue(s) we all need to concern ourselves with... and not just for "save the whales/world" way, but for divorcing ourselves from the middle east economy in general, as well as basic practical pragmatic cost concerns. That said, this movie is the most cloying, sappy, poorly edited, and painful movie I've seen this year. My whole beef with Al Gore is that he sounds like the Minister from the Simpsons, and is as tedious and preachy as that character. And ironically, Al's lecture on global warming begins with a Simpson's parody of a fake 1950's global warming educational film. Add in unneeded footage of him losing the election (suggesting he would have stopped global warming had he won), and Bush winning (yes we get it, Bush certainly is A if not THE problem in regards to energy problems today), the film it comes off as a not-so-subtle biopic, about a candidate reeling from a defeat after being considered having no backbone or mission, artificially coming up with "his mission": traveling back to the Tennessee riverbanks, going to Antarctica, touring college campuses. And edited in a way to be more of an infomercial for his cause, than about the subject in earnest. And instead of offering solutions (which is done in an infomercial way at the end, mixed into the credits) he pushes "separating truth from fiction"... somewhat antithetical to a movie smearing together dubious personal anecdotes and real scientific data. I've seen about 10 far more interesting, terrifying, and mind awakening docs on PBS regarding global warming than this... I would have rather watched them again. This came off, the way Kerry and Gore have in their election runs, as "talking down" to the lowest common denominator, instead of standing up for what they say they believe in. I really looked forward to seeing this, I wanted to be awestruck, and was just oozed over with smarmy sloganeering and cheesy presentation.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>According to Al Gore and all his supporters of the GW myth, we have to do something about climate change or face the consequences. But in reality it has never been proved that humans cause GW. But regardless of the truth in this matter, the notion that we must save the climate from changing lies solely on a false assumption of the current and past climate: That today's climate is tame and easy to adapt to. But the reality is that even today and in the past there have been storms, floods, droughts or too much snow. So what on earth makes GW proponents believe that today's climate deserves peresevation? Tell it to the people in Asia where they have to face the annual Monsun inundations and hundreds of them drown each year. Tell it to the people in Colorado who have to shovel tons of snow from their yards. Tell it to the people who cannot grow anything on dessicated land in Africa. Tell it to the people who cannot pay for their increased heating costs because of hard winters. So where is this oh so friendly and clement climate that deserves preservation? Even thousands of years later people still grapple with adapting to the climate and you know what? They never will because climate is too incalculable. And the idea that today's climate is the ideal climate is just recondite. No, Al Gore proved nothing in this movie. He just parroted the same talking points of people who want to make us believe that GW is a threat. It's just scare tactics to fleece money off governments and to secure funds for future research. Face it: Climate has always been a threat to humanity. And it always will be.</fullReview>

Yet it seems when we hear something that fits are delusional reality we latch on to it. I not only guarantee you cannot prove global warming I guarantee you can't prove global cooling either. I can also guarantee that there is not one human being on this earth now or ever that understands truly the climate or environment of the earth. Sure we can make models and come up with words that describe things we truly do not understand but probability will tell you given a set of rules anything is possible.

While I only watched the movie once, I found it to be littered with self-serving political jabs that overshadowed the purported intentions of the film.For example, Gore makes a major point regarding a Bush aide who edited an environmental report. However, early in the movie we hear a recording of New Orleans' mayor begging for help during the first days of the Katrina disaster, followed by Al Gore's voice mysteriously entering the conversation with "Please tell me what I can do to help." I suppose creating a fictitious Katrina-friendly discussion is OK as long as it continues to paint Gore as some sort of saint.I was also unaware that the fall of Communism was a "truly bi-partisan" effort, as Mr. Gore vehemently opposed every move by the Reagan administration with regards to military escalation up to and including the Star Wars program. As we all know, these were major contributors to the Soviet Union raising the white flag that ended the Cold War.I suppose the biggest question does not involve Mr. Gore's tireless efforts in the 70's, 80's, and over the last ten years. Instead, I wonder exactly what he did to solve this issue when he was the second most powerful man in the world. Apparently Mr. Gore had more important things to do during those eight years.Saint Al could have done so much good with this film, but instead used it to bitch and moan about how he lost an election he should have won in a landslide. By doing this, he lost a golden opportunity to gain bipartisan support. At least it is comforting to know he used a massive motorcade to travel the eight blocks to the movie's premiere instead of following his own advice and WALKING.Do as I say, not as I do.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you like your propaganda served up with more than a hint of smug self-righteousness then this film is for you.The sad thing about Gore's film is that so many of the pompous pronouncements about those who don't agree with him are actually more accurately levelled at Gore himself.From his silly attempts to link hurricane Katrina to global warming (it isn't) to his astonishingly inaccurate conclusion that the melting of the glacier on Kilimanjaro is linked to warming (it isn't).From beginning to end, the film is a littany of misrepresentations, exaggerations and outright deceptions.Even one of his more objective claims - that 2005 was the hottest year on record - turns out to be untrue and that the only reason that 2005 was believe to be was due to faulty computations by people who were predisposed to believe in anthropogenic global warming.You want a real documentary about global warming?

		<fullReview>Everyone has been informed of the dangers of global warming although in reality, global warming is only a theory, it is not a proved problem. For all we know it is like an ice age only backwards, or for that matter, it may stop heating up after a while. In fact, when the world was created it was much hotter than it was today.Al Gore's attempt of informing America of Global Warming is merely him trying to gain people's votes.Besides that, its not like anyone besides a few over dramatic people who always get so emotionally attached to movies will even listen to it. This isn't in anyway a good movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Especially Scientific</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a Republican and by no means a fan of Al Gore, but I was looking forward to seeing this film because I had heard it was a) riveting and b) scientifically informative. I was mildly disappointed in both respects.While the images it portrays and the consequences it predicts are ominous indeed, this film is, at its heart, not a documentary about global warming. It is a documentary about Al Gore giving a slideshow about global warming. To that end, it includes long segments describing Al Gore's childhood on a tobacco farm, a story about how his son was hit by a car, and so forth. Even in the sections of the film devoted to scientific argument, the camera lingers generously on the silhouetted profile of Mr. Gore, showing him looking determined and thoughtful. It's political self-service, and it's unseemly in what is supposed to be a scientific documentary. These sections made the film significantly too long; at 100 minutes, it's the longest slideshow you'll ever sit through, and much in need of trimming. To his credit, Mr. Gore is a fine speaker, but his snarky humor and attempts at political relevance detract from the message of the film.As for being scientifically informative, "An Inconvenient Truth" didn't tell me anything I didn't already know. Yes, greenhouse gases, icecaps, extreme weather conditions, etc., etc. -- this is Science Lite, mostly the basic introduction to global warming you'd get in high school Earth Science. (On the other hand, I'm currently taking a climate change course, so some of the material may have been more familiar to me than to the average viewer.) I was hoping Gore would address some issues that skeptical paleoclimatologists have raised, namely:1. That, historically, CO2 levels have lagged behind temperature changes (rather than the other way around) by around 600 yrs. 2. That global temperature data may be influenced by the "urban heat island effect" (ie, weather stations located near cities show artificially higher temperatures unrelated to global warming).Note that I am neither a denier of nor a believer in the theory of global warming Mr. Gore espouses; I was hoping he might answer these criticisms and give me a clue one way or the other. But Gore does not delve much into refuting criticisms of global warming theory. As a result, "An Inconvenient Truth" is persuasive mostly to those who have already been persuaded.I was VERY disappointed to see that Gore references an article by Nancy Oreskes stating, essentially, that there is a 100% consensus in the scientific literature about global warming. I have read this article, and have also read criticisms of it; furthermore, I have read a large number of articles expressing skepticism about the consensus opinion on global warming (articles which, according to Oreskes and Gore, shouldn't exist), all published in reliable scientific journals. It is important to note that doubting the consensus opinion on the climatic effect of CO2 is a valid scientific view, simply because the environment is so hard to predict and research. Gore belittles non-consensus opinions with appallingly vicious sarcasm.CONCLUSION:"An Inconvenient Truth" is a political vehicle for Al Gore more than an in-depth scientific study. It says nothing new, merely feeding previously researched Science to the masses in polemical form. The film is too long and has too little substance to be interesting as a work of cinema, and the way it services Al Gore is distracting and disturbing. With all that said, "An Inconvenient Truth" is a powerful film and slickly made film, and might serve as a useful primer or refresher on global warming science, so long as the viewer remembers that the science of the matter is far more complex than Gore represents it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Strong Argument Undermined By Al Gore</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Coming into this movie, I was a skeptic. However, I have to say that a fairly strong case was laid out in favor of significantly greater action in combating global warming. That was the good half of this movie. The part of this movie, was the half that was just propaganda for Al Gore. There are countless scenes of the solitary Al Gore, trying to spread the word for global action all by himself. We constantly see Al Gore sitting at his computer recognizing the environmental issues by scrolling through some pictures of glaciers. Throughout the movie we see the highlights of Al Gore's political career. Al Gore came into Congress and introduced environmental concerns, and held hearing by himself. Not much is said about his Vice Presidency, save that he was Vice President. However, in one scene, Gore does use this film as an opportunity to compare himself to Winston Churchill. There are several scenes of him back at the "family farm", and we are told his father (the Senator) won "Best Breeder." Al tells the story of his son almost dying. The movie is also peppered with some jokes written for Al Gore, some of which are kinda funny. I'm glad that Al Gore brings his charisma to this film, but wouldn't it be better if it showed some actual "experts"? Gore constantly says "scientists say" or "experts say" I'd rather hear some other people with more credibility say.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It didn't really deserve a 1, but that's what I gave it. After all, "Triumph of the Will" has a 7.9, and why should this have more? In many ways, they are the same. They are propaganda films, not documentaries. They are meant to convince people that a certain truth is the only truth, that a certain solution is the only solution, that all evidence supports one view, and only those leaders who accept these views are the ones worthy of following by implication."Inconvenient Truth" wasn't horrendous, but it represents a new fusion of art and politics that we haven't seen since WWII (with the fusion between science/academia/art not seen since Victorian England). And then, the Arts world was quick to abandon its blind following of 'the cause' as soon as the war was over. But now, despite thousands of scientists questioning and cautioning the film's claims, "Inconvenient Truth" and co. is the hot item for many in certain ideological and political circles. And just like "Triumph of the Will" 60 plus years ago, it whips folks up into such a frenzy that no other idea, no other evidence, and no other solution will be listened to, or tolerated.I have a feeling that in years to come, folks who have survived the cataclysm-yet-to-come because of global warming will look back and put this movie, and the millions who made it what it is, through the same prism of realism that is so lacking today.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Global Warming is a Scam!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This so-called categorized documentary, is based on junk-science! It has surely fooled a great many in this country, who without question accept it's hypothesis (out of pure desire).Don't get me wrong, I believe the earth is getting warmer. I believe the climate is changing. I don't believe this is caused by man. I (along with many other qualified non-former politicians and non-celebrities) am not sure why the hype is so strong lately but I agree with author Michael Crichton (he wrote Jurassic Park) that the environmental movement is full of bad science, foundations seeking $$$$ and more $$$$ and celebrities who want to promote a cause they know nothing about.Crichton makes a brilliant observation about global warming in Jurassic Park. He basically says that humans are arrogant to think that they can destroy the planet Earth which has withstood much more than we could ever hope to throw at it over billions of years. Excellent point.And Al Gore's movie... The movie cover with the hurricane spewing forth from a smoke stack? Last year was one of the quietest hurricane years on record. Nice one, Al. His movie is a joke! It's a two hour campaign ad.The modern environmentalist movement is about hating America for it's progress. It's a ploy to destroy capitalism. It's a socialist lie. China is polluting at an astronomical rate. In the next few years their carbon emissions will eclipse ours. Do you hear anyone complaining about China? Do you hear the French calling for a global tax on China's carbon emissions? Of course you don't because it's political not scientific. Think about it.For more on this, I recommend the book Unstoppable Global Warming: Every 1500 Years. It's a book written by real scientists (no they're not former politicians or movie stars) who examine the real science behind global warming. I suggest picking it up.Get educated on this and stop listening to the hate America, BS science crowd.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In a sad but ultimately unavoidable state of affairs, the political global warming bandwagon has entered the world of cinema. Al Gore is the latest 'celebrity' to have recognised the fame and attention associated with publicly supporting global warming, coincidently in line with the US presidential elections in which he is actively involved (Hmmmm strange no?). For years now people like Bob Geldolf and Bono have been tirading the public, morally mugging them of their money, of which how much does/can help global warming is unknown. Every year Bob Geldolf curses us all to damnation for "wasting power", Bob presumably lives on the moon for most of the year, only coming to earth to take more money off people. Ironically, Bob calling his daughter 'Peaches' is the real crime, we should be raising money to help her change her name/parents. Bono similarly has he own way of damning us to hell for wasting power, by arranging massive global concerts with overpaid nobody's supposedly who all care about global warming. Of course these huge concerts waste no power at all, they are powered by CO2, so they only help global warming, or so Bono would have us believe. In short, film is not about global warming, its about Al Gores political career.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good presentation, so-so science</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is another one of those Michael Moore type documentaries but even more extreme. By that I mean that at first glance, the film seems to completely level whatever it is attacking (in this case its telling us about how we've screwed up our climate) and does a pretty good job at it but when you really focus in on the scientific aspects, you'll find out an inconvenient truth. In this case it is that you don't here the other side of the story and there is a lot to it.Al Gore is one very good presenter and speaker. He knows how to connect to the audience and how to sell his arguments. But don't be fooled because although there is a lot of truth in what he says and the message is noble, there is more to the story than what Gore bothers telling you. He doesn't do so much lying but simply picks what he says very cleverly and knows what not to say. If you're a bit more familiar with the topic, these things become overly evident.First of all carbon dioxide. Yes, temperature rises (only 0.6 degrees C over the last century) have gone hand in hand with carbon dioxide level rises but there is more to the story. Firstly only a small part of all the carbon dioxide in our atmosphere is anthropogenic (man made), secondly the effects of carbon dioxide on global warming are logarithmic whereby the more you add, the less effect it has and thirdly, carbon dioxide isn't even the largest greenhouse gas. Water vapor (of which 99.999% is of natural origin) is and is responsible for about 90-95% of the greenhouse effect. Plus he neglects to mention all the astronomical factors that effect our climate such sunspot and sun irradiance cycles and the changes of the earth's tilt and orbit among other things. Now aren't those convenient facts to simply leave out? Then Gore talks about the sea rising by the end of this century by a whole 6 meters (accompanied by many frightening shots of famous locations like New York) being flooded. The United Nations lists a somewhat different figure- 0.48 meters. Gore simply takes the absolute worst case scenario prediction and tells us that that is exactly what is going to happen. Then very cleverly he works in all sorts of horrifying images that he passes off as the effects of global warming. One such example is the drying of lake Chad which according to Gore was caused by global warming. He says the same thing about the Aral Sea accompanied by frightening shots of boats in the middle of the desert. Unfortunately for him, both were caused by the over exploitation of the rivers that fed the lakes. There is more, a lot more.He constantly uses demagogy to support his points by showing moving images of a drowning polar bear or the completely unrelated topic of his son getting hit by a car. But despite all his inaccuracies and convenient omissions, the message is still sound. We should be looking for other energy sources and he does touch this subject briefly. Perhaps that should have been the main focus of the film.If you see this film, be aware that there is more to the scientific part of the story than what Gore is willing to talk about. See this to learn how to give a good speech and sell your arguments.</fullReview>

Cut down all the trees you tree Huggers. All green house gas combined only amounts to 1% of earths gas. If green house gas was causing the oceans to heat up, the shallow water would boil before the deep water even warmed up. It would be almost as hot at night as it is in the day time if green house gas was the cause. I'm on broil when it's hot, not bake. Kyoto would only change the climate .007th of 1% in 100 years. Maybe! That's if all the poor people don't panic over the cost of energy and burn every thing they can find. They would! It's solar storms that is causing global warming. The submariners have pumped cold air into the water to freeze water for decades. They can make an island in minutes. Put big fans in the arctic and pipe cold air into the water. Water freezes at 33%. It gets -50 to -120 on the poles. You could freeze enough water with a simple trick like that to make it possible to walk from Alaska to Siberia for practically free. Put big cooling towers on the coastal regions and pump cold oxygen rich air in the water there. Why not pump steam and burned product like sugar beet into the stratosphere and block out the sun.

		<fullReview>This movie is definitely bigger than Al Gore ! As an outsider, I see some political overtones here and there but on the whole, it is a compelling argument in favor of how we could potentially alter the 'global climatic cycles' ! The analogies he draws, his call for action and most importantly his passion for environment come across clearly.Even more so, we understand Al Gore himself as a son, a brother, a father and most of all a human being who cannot just sit there and watch his neighbor's house burn ! As a movie, I would rate it as 'worth a watch' and 'worth telling your movie-buffet buddies about'.Despite all this, the absence of something caught my eye. Al Gore explains all his charts and data very well..... but when he shows this particular chart that has the temperature-CO2 levels projected over the last 600,000 year time line, he only shows how high the 'current CO2 levels' are compared to any other time in this span! At this point, I was really curious to know how the temperature changed with respect to it in recent years and if it still adhered to the previous 'cyclical limits' but he does not display that data or even attempt to project future estimates! May be a convenient omission? I have not seen this data anywhere else but if one of you come across that last piece of information missing in the movie, can you please post it here?</fullReview>

In viewing a "documentary", however, it is interesting to question exactly why it is that Mr. Gore is making assertions which are demonstrably incorrect. His casual dismissal of the medieval warming period, grossly under-represented on his graph, puts his entire thesis in doubt, as does his warning of 22 feet of sea level rise when NASA put this at a maximum of 33 inches two years ago. The scene with Gore standing n front of extinct species, supposed victims of global warming, was particularly amusing as almost none of the creatures were actually destroyed by climate change and the coelecanth still exists!

		<fullReview>An Inconvenient Truth is like a dramatic movie where you need to have some stomach to hold throughout all the length of the picture. You can even shed a tear in the very end, out of sheer enthusiasm or because you're moved. It's at the same time devastating and heroic, despairing and encouraging; it's the equivalent to an epic where the hero dies and the movies ends. What's the difference? The subject of the picture ? or a better word would be documentary - eclipses the medium used. The "we" never had such a meaning, so full, because it is for the "we",the "us" in the broadest and ultimate meaning of the word, that it is set for. All, with no exception, breaking the barriers of religion, sex, origin, political beliefs, cultural background or age. Many of the last movies to receive world-wide acclaim - not to say the Oscar - have invariably touched one of these subjects, ranging from the holocaust, to sexual orientation, war, racism, aids, cultural or religious intolerance. And yet all of these seem to be atrocities of a few - not dismissing their significance -, a sample of man at its worse, but can't be seen as mankind acting against itself. And i find this morally disturbing. The idea of offering a poisoned gift to people that are not here yet, generations to come, is such a weight to bare. What about the movie,the direction, the cutting, the soundtrack? Well ... does it really matter?In the end it said to spread the word, tell the people you know to see it, so: go on and see it.</fullReview>

However, before actually plastering a "Stop Global Whining" bumper-sticker on my car, I felt like I had a responsibility to at least see this film. After all it won an academy- award, right? Maybe my skepticism was misguided and spending a couple hours with Al Gore would straighten me out.Actually, I really did try to view this film with an open mind (and probably had more of one than those who see it already convinced that man-made global warming is real). I even admit to being afraid of what the film might show me. After all, it won an academy-award, right? Hollywood royalty gave Al Gore a standing ovation that night. It must be brilliant!The truth is, I couldn't believe how BAD this film was. I was shocked, in fact. At the least, I expected something to grapple with and arguments that would challenge me. I did not expect the most prominent (and just about the only) source quoted to be Al's high school science teacher who had a few theories. Then, since Al didn't quote sources during the film, I expected the extras in the DVD to contain them; wrong-- they don't; they merely contain commentaries from the producers and the director (Hmmmmm. . . I wonder what those are like?), and--low and behold--more comments from Al; what a bonus! The before/after shots of melting glaciers went by so quickly that I barely saw them (perhaps I was supposed to be simply horrified by the notion that . . . oh my god . . . ice melts!!!!) And the many shots of Al Gore frowning out the windows of (no-doubt private) airplanes and (no-doubt solo) taxi-cabs made me laugh out loud and spew my beer across the room. But thankfully the moody electronic music in the background let me know that this movie was serious and gravely important. No beer spewing and certainly no popcorn mastication allowed. Attention must be paid!B.S! Put up better arguments, quote your sources, engage in debates with some of the many scientists who disagree with your conclusions, and maybe I'll pay attention. As far as this lame piece of propaganda: I recommend it to those who want to swill beer, eat popcorn and have a good laugh. The next morning, the "Stop Global Whining" bumper-sticker went on my vehicle. Until Chicken Little can make a few decent arguments, I'm not buying in.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fine powerpoint presentation, but it is not a movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the powerpoint presentation that made Al Gore famous again. But that is what it is: a powerpoint presentation. Nothing more. It does not deserve an Oscar or a Nobel peace price.The main idea behind this "An Inconvenient Truth" is that Global Warming exist, and that it is man-made. Though i think it is OK that Al Gore made this powerpoint presentation, then it is very wrong of him as to claim that it is a scientific fact that Global Warming exist - because it just isn't.The main pretext for the theory of Global Warming to be true, is that the climate of earth has always been stable, until modern man destroyed the climate with big factories and CO2-emissions. All agree on that.But the thing is that the Earth climate has never ever been stable. A couple of thousands of years ago the earth was engulfed in an ice age. Before that Ice Age, the earth experienced a hot age - a time when the temperature was way higher than today. This is all scientific fact - go read about it in you local library. Before that "hot age", the earth experienced another ice age. Before that Ice age, the earth experienced yet another hot age, and before that yet yet another ice age.The pro-global-warming Al-gore fan would then postulate that man-made CO2 was responsible for those ice ages and warm ages. But that just isn't true. Modern Man with all the factories and cars didn't exist back then, and yet Global Warming happened. How does that fit with the Prophet Al Gores theories of that all Global Warming is caused by man? Fact is that the Climate of Earth have been changing from hot temperature to cold temperature all the ages in which earth has existed. The Earth have experienced much warmer weather in the past, when the amount of CO2 was way lower than it is today (research this, it is true). All these amounts of evidence against man made global warming just shows that man made CO2 does not have a significant impact on the climate of earth.Global Warming happens, but it is not the result of man made CO2. Other factors play in to this scenario as well. Most notable must be the sun and cosmic rays. Do we humans really think that our climate is unaffected by the immense powers of the universe? Hell no! Try to read about this theory. One notable scientist, whose work on this you should read, is Henrik Svensmark. Read some papers by Henrik Svensmark, and you'll find that Global Warming happens, but it is not caused by Carbon-dioxide (CO2), but the cosmos.It is fine that this "movie" got attention. But why did Al Gore get a Nobel Peace Price??? That is really not good. Peace Prices are given to people that actually MAKES PEACE! The Nobel Peace Price shouldn't be given to the maker of a powerpoint presentation.</fullReview>

I love Al Gore as an administrator, but as a speaker, gawd! Zzzzzzzzz. I'm ashamed to admit that I wanted to be wowed with new material. Hey, did you hear of the science teacher that isn't allowed to show Inconvenient Truth? A parent found out and went to the school board.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mark Twain is reputed to have said: "There are lies, damned lies and statistics."I also read the book, "How to lie with statistics" about 30 years ago in my statistics class.As an engineer, I have to seriously question Al Gore's presentation regarding the following:1. 650,000 years of glacial ice studies have stated that the CO2 levels in the atmosphere have been cyclical in nature. I believe this however, I question whether the actual amount of CO2 observed in ice is not obviated (lessened) by age. Picture a bicycle tire after 650,000 years. What do you think the probability is that the tire will lose air during this time? What I mean to say is how are we assured that the air samples containing CO2 within the ice didn't lose CO2 over time? If the CO2 permeated (leaked) from the ice in these prehistoric times, the actual CO2 in the atmosphere could have been much greater. Also, in the same presentation, how can he be sure that samples of Ice were taken for every year between 650,000 years ago and today? There could have been peaks (Very High CO2 levels) that occurred during years that were not measured.2. Al Gore then seems to want to equate CO2 levels in the atmosphere directly to mean temperatures on Earth. I do not know how you can accurately have measured temperature 200+ years ago as any method other than direct thermometer or isocouple measurement is likely a poor measurement at best.3. I believe in cyclical weather patterns on earth and believe that Al Gore did his best to honestly portray the cycles, but I cannot really fathom the difference between what happened during peak warming trends in the past to what is happening today? You really need to question the following?:A. Are the temperature levels different now than they were during high temperature cycles occurring in the past? I do not think this case has been made.B. What caused the temperature cycle to get colder in the past? I believe there were 5-6 temperature cycles depicted in Al Gore's presentation.C. Does man and his air pollution really have a great impact on the Earth? Carl Sagan (A noted and well regarded scientist himself) predicted catastrophic consequences of oil well fires right after the first Persian Gulf war and there was little if any issues with this.4. The pictures of the retreating glaciers was very interesting to me in that only years and not actual dates (Month / Day / Year) information were provided. I could take a picture of my front lawn in Minnesota during January and see a glacier and take another in July and see green grass. Yes we may be seeing some glacial melt over time but I believe this may be part of a cyclical trend.In summary, I believe at current consumption rates we will run out of oil in 20-30 years and this may help take care of the problem if one really exists. I believe we should invest in alternative energy sources because we will eventually need them. But I have to say that Gore being a Democrat uses this movie as a forum for his anti-big oil (See Republican bashing) and political gain. Lets stop the panic</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Yet another childish form of informing people who do not think ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It seems everyone wants to make a soap opera of a definite threat to the earth, to appeal to advertising senses of the human being. All I keep seeing is people still do not care about what marketing and manufacturing in its present form is doing to the earth. it doesn't matter how you can educate people, either with cute comics about melting ice cream or looking at the stats, or telling me how cool Al Gore for being so sensitive, none of this transforms how we can improve our lifestyle and still be energy sensitive: "Well, that's great, Al. Your the man. I'll chat about this with my friends amid talking about sex and beer and how wasted I can get tonight and think I had a good time."I don't care about Al Gore and how cool he's supposed to be or about what he faced at losing the election or whatever. All I hear is some "celebrity" publicising he cares about the earth, teaching the world like children how the earth works. Better to teach people that global warming is one effect of showing we all have no identity.Yesterday, Sydney had Earth Hour: 60 minutes of lights out as an awareness of emissions caused by electric stations. I went to the city centre by the Opera House in the hope that I could share with people the beauty of looking at the night sky like I had when I was at the Grampians National Park and the sky was ablaze with stars. But, no. Everyone is still eating in restaurants that couldn't think to work in candle light. Street lights were still pumping in case of liability of any accidents that were bound to happen. And so this great moment, where people were faced with speaking to their neighbour in wonder, was lost. I hear so many stupid conversations on public transport all the time, and no one thought to consider or wonder about the consequence of the failure of this event.Wake up, people. You don't need 80% of the things being made for you to buy and have a brilliant life. Remember where you live and who lives with you. The greatest travesty in life is not to use your mind. Use your instinct and think. No, these are not 2 opposing ideas. God forbid if someone starts writing about instinct v thinking. Spare everyone that, please.Who cares if some politician tells you something, like an evangelist, that you already know? Why do people think stars are so amazing in films, but never remember the message? You are the greatest star. No one is greater than you. Think about that.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>...If not written for a 3 year old. The fact laden material I am not going to argue with do to the fact that NO environmental scientist can agree, but I will say that I agree with the message put forth in the film. Once again, NO environmental scientist can agree on a certain inalienable truth, but obviously Al Gore has found hundreds of sources to agree with his cause (once again, I agree with the message put forth). Any person that has taken a university level course dealing with atmosphere or any Earth science is sorely disappointed, but again, this movie is made for the people that obviously failed to go to college or take a biology course where they went... Not worth watching if you have paid attention for the last 20 years, if not, then see this, then pick up a copy of Nature magazine.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Al Gore is a genius for creating a hoax more elaborate than Bigfoot, and then perpetuating mass hysteria. Funny thing is, Gore's "science" came from the same meteorologists who can't accurately predict yesterday's weather, and Mr. Gore wants us to believe they are right over the next 50 years? Talk about a leap of faith. The most troubling part of this film is not that he sulked about losing in 2000 more than he quoted fact, rather, it was that many facts he quoted were manipulated to fit his argument. For instance, the CO2 graph against the temperature graph... many of the world's leading climatologists (people who study long term climate change, unlike Gore's meteorologists who only have records accurately dating back 150 years) have testified in front of the U.S. and Canadian Governments that CO2 is a RESULT of temperature change, not the cause, so naturally they will fit together. However, Mr. Gore's claims are as absurd as saying that lung cancer causes smoking. Science has also proved that 450 million years ago, the coldest period in the last 500 million years, the CO2 levels were 10 times higher than they are today, funny Gore's graph didn't go back that far. Polar bear numbers have also increased over the last 50 years, and contrary to what Gore claims, 11 of the 13 species of polar bears are still increasing in population. This movie was an absolute joke. "It is difficult to get a man to understand something when his salary depends upon his not understanding it." -Upton Sinclair. This quote, which Gore uses in the film, is most fitting for him. It is hard for someone to find the truth, when they are getting paid six figures, and awarded honorary degrees for speaking falsehood.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Truth?...from Al Gore???</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the fall of 1968 Al Gore claimed that he'd influenced the nomination acceptance speech of Hubert Humphrey through conversations with a Chicago Sun columnist. Al Gore asserted he was Humphrey's ghost writer, but the columnist said that he had nothing to do with that speech. Al Gore's claim wasn't true.In 1987 Al Gore told the DesMoines Register as he began his Presidential campaign that his youthful reporting had led to the indictment and imprisonment of several people, but that wasn't true.In August 1987 the Los Angeles Times reported that Gore had bragged that half of his Presidential Campaign staff were women, but it wasn't true.In February of 1988 the Washington Post quoted Al Gore that he been shot at in Vietnam. It wasn't true. That claim was shot down by Newsweek in December of 1999.In April 1988 Al Gore told a League of Women Voters gathering that he had written the law of Superfund. Recently he changed his story because the real author of the Superfund law was James Florio.On October 30, 1992, Gore denied that there was a dump on his father's farm, but national television showed the pictures.On December 15, 1997, Time magazine reported that Al Gore claimed that he and Tipper had served as role models for the Eric Segal novel, Love Story. That wasn't true.On March 9, 1999, Al Gore told Wolf Blitzer on CNN that "I took the initiative in creating the Internet." It wasn't true. The Department of Defense got the Internet underway in 1969. Al Gore was 21 in 1969.On April 25, 1999, Al Gore told the Detroit chapter of the NAACP that his father was a fighter for civil rights, but he didn't tell them that his father had voted against the Civil Rights Act of 1964.On June 1, 1999, at a Women for Gore event, Al Gore said he'd always been pro- choice, but that wasn't true. As a Congressman he had voted pro-life on many occasions.On October 14, 1999, Al Gore's website proclaimed that he'd worked for the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty for 20 years, but that claim wasn't true. As late as 1992 Al Gore had opposed that Treaty on the Senate floor.On November 1, 1999, Time magazine reported that Al Gore had claimed to have authored the Earned Income Tax Credit. That wasn't true. The Earned Income Tax Credit was passed into law in 1975 and Al Gore didn't even enter Congress until 1977.On November 24, 1999, The New York Times reported that Al Gore claimed to have been a co-sponsor of the McCain Feingold Campaign Finance Reform Bill. But Al Gore never served in the Senate with Senator Feingold. It wasn't true.In June of 2000 Al Gore said "I introduced the very first free t.v. legislation in the Senate in 1988," but more than 150 bills on that subject had been previously introduced in previous Congresses. It just wasn't true.At a convention of Teamsters on September 18th, Al Gore said that one of the lullabies of his that he'd been sung to as a child had been a union song. Then he sang a few words of it, but the song he sang wasn't written until Al Gore was in his 20s. It simply wasn't true.On September 22nd Al Gore told the Associated Press that he'd been part of a discussions on strategic petroleum reserve since the days it was first established. But that reserve was established in 1975 and Al Gore did not enter Congress until 1977.In a presidential debate, Mr. Gore said that he'd accompanied Jamie Lee Witt, the head of the federal government's emergency response team, to catastrophic fires in Texas, but that wasn't true. He didn't accompany Mr. Witt and he didn't go to those fires. He made it up. It wasn't true.The New York Times quotes a professor of psychology in saying that Al Gore's record is "like the false memory syndrome where people end up believing that they were abducted by aliens." The head of the California Democratic Party says that he cannot explain Al Gore's behavior because he is not a "psychiatrist." Now, Al Gore presents us this film which is filled with many more examples of his pathological penchant for making things up and lying. Gore refuses to debate any climate scientist not on his payroll.One thing that will disabuse any thinking person of being sucked in by the man-made global warming scam is this: Volcanoes have caused more atmospheric pollution than all of human created CO2 in history...sometimes with a single eruption cycle! The natural filter of ocean algae converts CO2 into oxygen. When there are large amounts of CO2, more algae thrives. Human activity causes only minimal amounts of CO2...0.001% of the atmosphere...not enough to get excited about unless you want to make people feel guilty so they will give you money and the power to tax and control evil capitalists...Temperature variations of earth's climate are mainly caused by the sun...but this fact does not fit the agenda of Gore and his followers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very interesting perspective on global warming</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film gives a very interesting view on global warming. The issue of global warming have came up a number of times in the past and is a matter of great controversy. The film is very much like a lecture. While it does provide good argument and reasoning, the movie may prove to be dull to some viewers simply because of its style. Global warming is a issue that are believed by many scientists to be caused by solar ray, volcano, and other factors that really have nothing to do with human input of carbon dioxide. While the film is mildly entertaining and somewhat educational, it may potentially get the viewers all fired up about global warming, which is something that we could have nothing to do with. I think, before further scientific evidence are provided, this film should not be viewed too seriously.</fullReview>

It is a message that people should listen to and try to follow.I see little reason for negative reviews of this documentary, unless it is just political bias or skepticism regarding global warming. The only issue that I had was that his personal 'biography' segments weren't entirely necessary, but they were still interesting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie is horrible and dishonest globalist propaganda.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off, Al Gore has been for years, and is, a lackey for globalist bankers and elitist eugenicists. That is why he made this film. This movie is one of the most appalling pieces of dishonest and (dare I say) evil propaganda ever produced in the history of our world. Its a damn shame that we all fell for it so easily. But now, after billions have been wasted and Gore has been made an extremely wealthy man, the truth is beginning to come out about this massive farce. Honestly, if the world were a just place, Gore and the producers of this movie would be thrown in jail for the money they swindled from the public with this piece of garbage.I do not have room to provide all of the supporting evidence for my claims. The part about Gore being a globalist lackey is my personal opinion, but the stuff about this movie being false is quite provable, below are some links to check out if you don't believe me:One of the main climate scientists in charge of research at East Anglia University admits the earth is not warming, among other things:http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1250872/Climategate-U-turn- Astonishment-scientist-centre-global-warming-email-row-admits-data- organised.htmlThe Global Warming Swindle: http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-5576670191369613647#Not Evil, Just Wrong: http://v.youku.com/v_show/id_XMTQ2ODQ0ODky.html</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Two Narratives</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the early 90's the CIA changed its charter from monitoring the Soviets to looking at all serious threats to the nation. Out of this came Project Medea, focused on climate change. Using classified intelligence ? much of it still classified ? this large project concluded absolutely that global warming was occurring and that it was an immanent threat to the nation. This was reported in public by the Director in 1996.When Bush came to power, the project was dismantled by Cheney who as Secretary of Defense fought the establishment of Medea. The results were buried and denied and Bush went on record saying that climate change was a hoax. (Both he and McCain now admit that climate change is occurring but that we need to "be deliberate" and "cost effective" in responding. You know what that means.)Some of the material from Medea is used in this movie: the Arctic Ice Cap thickness survey, but if Gore (who was briefed at the time) could have used that larger material, his case would have been even stronger. It is strong enough, despite a few unnecessarily dramatic photographic effects that bend the context here and there. That classified science might not have made for a cinematic presentation because much of it deals with extinction-scale pandemics. The presentation program used here is KeyNote, Apple's competitor to Microsoft's PowerPoint. Its worth noting that it is a very snazzy product. Apparently much of the design from that period came from the wishes of Gore for this project and the demands of Steve Jobs for his own keynote speeches. Its a great story by itself.In terms of narrative construction, there are two stories here. One is the story of the collapse of the Earth's weather system. Frankly, I think he could have done a better job on this. The science is complex but overwhelming. But it does not lend itself well to pictures or simple predictions.To make this palatable, you need a wrapper story, a framing narrative. What's refreshing about this is that the usual choice wasn't made: to focus on the "conspiracy" of climate change deniers, a couple of outlier scientists and a passel of industry groups and ideologue political organizations. Instead, they chose to wrap the slideshow with a story of redemptive idealism about the presenter. I think it works, but it carries baggage. About two fifths of the electorate voted against this guy, and many of those did because they preferred a different myth, a different story. That's a pretty heavy burden to overcome if what you want to do is lubricate the essential message. I had only a little trouble with it because I know how truly earnest he is. But earnestness and dedication isn't science, and facts, truth is supposed to be the issue at core.You cannot be successful in advertising that with personal voyages and memories.But so far as the slide show. Its definitely worth watching.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Boring piece of propaganda</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is so bad I hardly know where to start. After watching it and reading the viewer reviews, I can't believe the average rating is over 2.First, this isn't primarily about global warming: it is really a PR piece for Al Gore with global warming just a teaser to get you in the door. But it isn't even a good PR piece. What we learn is that Gore still has a chip on his shoulder about losing the election. Do we really need to hear about all of his family history, tragedies and near tragedies? Does it help global warming to find out he grew up on a farm where they grew tobacco? (Tobacco?!!)The "facts" presented went through a fine sifter where any questions, contradictions and doubts about global warming were carefully removed. The result is not a scientific report; it is pure propaganda intended only to promote his cause. Where is the discussion about the Earth coming out of a mini ice-age, warming occurring on Mars, sunspot activity? We see polar bears falling in the water, but he doesn't mention that the polar bear population has been increasing for the last few years. By the way, polar bears swim to hunt and for recreation. Much blame was put on global warming for Katrina, but you hear little mention of the low hurricane activity since then.Simply judged as a movie, this effort fails miserably. Only the true believers can make it through this boring lecture without dozing off. This wouldn't even qualify as a halfway interesting college lecture let alone something you would rent for entertainment. The Academy Award it received is proof of the political agenda of the movie Academy.I don't understand how anyone can listen to Al Gore's call to action with a straight face while knowing that he lives in a huge mansion that uses as much energy as a small hotel, rides in a Cadillac limousine and flies alone in a gas guzzling private jet. If everyone lived Al Gore's lifestyle the planet would be barren. And how about his tobacco farm: how many people have died as a direct result of the product he grew?If this movie was entered in a high school science fair, it would not receive a passing mark.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Facts Vs Propaganda</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a Media Studies student, I've approached this movie critically. Watching Al Gore dish out the facts and the somewhat shocking statistics was very effective. Yet I found myself questioning the validity of his sources, the gathering of his evidences and wondering how he could've presented the opposing arguments with their statistics and then defuse them. He didn't do that consistently. However, I did find the first 40 minutes of this 'documentary' quite engaging. Then his arguments became repetitive and tedious.Don't get me wrong. Al Gore is a brilliant narrator with a flair for explaining his arguments precisely, effectively and user-friendly. He broke down these complex discussions into simple and understandable terms and theories. I liked the part where he talks about the natural climate change and links it with Global Warming, thus introducing small measures of opposition arguments. I also admired him for linking the changes in Population and Nuclear Arms with his topic. The film itself is brilliant from a technical perspective and the filmmakers use film theories on effectiveness flawlessly. If this was a fictional film, I would award it a much higher rating.It was those filler clips with Al Gore's personal and professional life completely eliminates this film as a serious documentary investigating the topic of 'Global Warming'. What these clips represent to me, is Al Gore's production team creating an emotional connection with the audience that is completely irrelevant to the topic of discussion. E.G. The overlong sequences of him with his kid, talking about growing up on his farm, of Hurricane Katrina - which was a serious and terrible tragedy - but I felt Al Gore was using this as an excuse to emotionally blackmail people into believing him while highlighting the failure of the Bush Admin. I even managed to catch a clip towards the start of the film where the camera frames his finger with his wedding band in clear view, and also when he choked at the mention of World Trade Center and linking it - trivially - to his topic by saying that the memorial would be underwater was despicable. This was a clear and deliberate sign that propaganda was at work.In then end, I feel that Al Gore could've tackled this in a lot of different ways. Particularly, the human element that he failed to deliver in this film, could've been approached with him motivating the audience into action by showing ways to help combat Global Warming. This part of the topic is restricted into the last 20 minutes. 'An Inconvenient Truth' promises a lot, but delivers little. It is a disappointment as is he. Why 4.5/10 then? I still believe that his research and the arguments he did provide were enlightening and admirable that he is attempting to make a difference but these qualities are greatly overshadowed by the obvious propaganda he tries to stir. Perhaps a less questioning generation would have appreciated and accepted this alleged documentary.(I believe he addresses this issue too, saying that doubting articles make the consumer confused - true, but do we really want to live in a society where information is not questioned? Where it is not regulated?) My personal affiliations with the topic are somewhat ambiguous; I want to help 'save the environment' but I don't know how and will I even be able to go through with the 'right thing' procedures. Before watching this film, I did and still do believe in Global Warming. However, this 'documentary' did not offer anything for me: I expected him to make the issue into a substantial global alert but what I got were some references to other parts of the world with most of it featuring the problems in North America. Some may argue that Al Gore, being an American who has dabbled in U.S. politics would concentrate on that continent with a special interest in China, the world's fastest growing economy. Once again I have to ask, then what does this documentary offer to me and to viewers like me?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As an educator in high school I was forced (politely coerced) to display this to my students. It was excruciating.I consider myself an environmentalist. Having lived next to the ocean in Southern California, I have seen, over the decades, an increase in pollution along the coast. Therefore, I am very sensitive to our civilization's dire impact on what not so long ago was as pristine as it was when it first came into existence.Enter the narcissist Gore who makes a documentary that's supposed to be scientific. I had my doubts then for the lack of scientists interviewed to substantiate his premise: that global warming is the result of human action. Now, (2009) an overwhelming majority of scientists agree that there is absolutely no reliable data that verifies any global warming at all.Why make up such claims when there is enough concrete proof to document man's blatantly reckless abuse of the earth? The answer, some will argue, is an attempt to hastily dissuade environmental destructiveness and discourage capitalistic endeavor. But to do so with a depiction of a very cute, computer generated polar bear cub drowning in an ice-less, arctic sea, is imagery for the very na?ve, and despicably, propaganda directed at the very young.This, and an occasional interruption that chronicled Gore's personal defeat in his presidential election bid, caused me great embarrassment for him, myself and my school, and for the entire teaching profession in America. To think such a clown actually won the popular vote. . . and a Nobel Peace prize. I am sure a more scientific and persuasive endeavor can be produced to reveal civilization's impact on the earth. Gore's film only does harm to a very important issue.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Powerful, Convincing And Frightening: From A Conservative</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers Ahead:First, I am very conservative, as you might deduce from my religious imagery. I went into the documentary quite skeptical, as with all politicians. What prompted my interest is that here, in Oregon, the winters are shorter and warmer; the summers are getting, empirically, longer and hotter. The days of being a little boy in three feet of snow are a distant memory now. Gore uses almost all audio / visual evidence with easily understandable empirical charts interspersed with shots of receding glaciers, disappearing lakes, eroding land based glaciers filled with melt-water streams plunging into holes in the middle of the ice mass. Seeing is believing, as others have noted, thankfully there is only one brief moment of revisiting the 2000 election which is a bit inappropriate; the overwhelming majority is empirical, photographic evidence that I found more cogent than statistical tables. Graphs and tables can always be attacked or impugned, time lapse photos of glacier recession over years is much harder to argue with. Gore seems to know this, the majority of his evidence is world-wide photographic evidence of glaciers and lakes disappearing. When you pair the photographic evidence with the hard data of the empirical statistical charts of CO2 increase paralleling global temperature rise: the conclusion seems unavoidable.When people laugh at anecdotal evidence, as I led off with, remember how insignificant we are in geological time. How vast the periods of climactic change are in terms of millions of years; when you notice empirical changes, that you even can perceive, trust me, it is not insignificant evidence. Given the scale of planetary climactic shifts, we should not even be able to notice any salient change. Gore is admirably self-deprecating, his using of an elevated lift to narrate his graph is accompanied by,"They showed me how to use this thing; if I don't kill myself using it I should be able to show you something interesting." He throws in his childhood, a family tragedy and his love of nature as a boy on a farm. Yes, fellow conservatives, he does mention that the majority of his life was spent growing up in a room in the Mayflower Hotel. He lived there when his father, also a senator, was in the Senate during its sessions. Empirical tables are well done, easily understandable and not so recondite that you need a statistician to explain it to you. He is quite methodical and meticulous in his presentation.It starts with just the gas changes to the atmosphere, he saves the consequences, quite horrific, until the very end. You sense his awareness of not waiting to chase you out the door with what is coming. My favorite part is showing how the melting of just Greenland or half of it with part of Antarctica would raise sea level twenty feet. He takes you around the world, city by city, showing the areas inundated under the rising waters. For fellow conservatives, as the other great reviewers have pointed out, this is democratic politics free. Gore does not subject you to their progressive ideology on social or business issues. Gore is at his very best here, his manner of speech is not the Achilles' Heel that damaged him so in his runs for office. There is no slow-motion pedantic, patronizing speech cadence that implies he is translating it for the thought-impaired. I always thought it was this that damaged him so; here, he talks like a regular person. I went in filled with conservative scorn for what I was sure was a typical progressive hit piece on business. When it was over, he convinced me completely. I went from totally mockingly skeptical to endorsing his conclusions.I cannot exaggerate the impact of time lapse photographic proof from around the globe. His presentation would have failed if it relied too heavily on empirical statistical charts. These can always be impugned, the evidence of your eyes is a bit harder to refute. As I gaze at pictures of Venus, whose oceans are now all in the atmosphere, for a miles deep atmosphere with a surface temperature of molten lead; I can not but wonder if once there were people and a civilization there. Perhaps, they waited too long also? Is this what Dr. Michio Kaku means when he says most physicists think nobody answers because they all destroyed themselves?

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly Effective and Relevant!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to say that former Vice President Al Gore takes on the global warming crisis. He was surprisingly effective. I used to call him "Gore the Bore" for his usual stiff presentation. Here, he seems relaxed and confident in argument. There is not much to persuade me. I do believe in global warming. Proof is the stronger hurricanes, tornadoes, and storms that occurred in the world. The glaciers are melting at an alarming rate and polar bears are drowning too. Gore shows a lot more than slides and presentation. He shows a side of himself that works in making him more likable. He didn't win the presidency in 2000 but maybe it was just as well. His calling has been to get the world involved in global warming and try to prevent it's eventual catastrophe. He has the knowledge and the equipment to deliver to his audience in an effective manner.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sincere intentions &amp; Scary truths; you have to see this one!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Forget all the other reality shows and get ready for the scariest one as former American Vice President Albert Gore takes you through saddening earth truths. Since the movie or rather the documentary has no plot except for bringing out realities, I thought of putting down some key takeaway points here in public interest. Gore begins by showing an earth picture from an Apollo mission in 1972 and goes on revealing stark truths. On global warming, he says people believe that earth is so big, what could we do to it but in reality, that thin atmosphere is as thin as a coat of varnish on a painting and this layer is being thickened by pollutants leading to more infrared rays get trapped inside which makes the earth hotter. So, if your kid&#x2019;s ice cream melts fast, blame is on global warming. Larger changes in the atmosphere are linked to growth in our civilization. Threats, glaciers are retreating, Mount Kilimanjaro will soon have no glaciers. Himalaya that supplies water to 40% of people on earth will soon have a problem. Same fate is in store for the Swiss Alps, and those in Peru and Argentina. He mixes the story with some of his personal accounts, one where he says he lost his 6 year old son in an accident and his focus shifted to larger earth issues that are not political but moral issues. He correlates last seven ice ages with the rise in carbon levels. With present levels way beyond what it was ever before, it is bound to hit extremes unless something is done. Also, 10 hottest years ever measured in history have all occurred in the last 14 years. Heat waves in India to storms and hurricanes including Katrina in the west, flooding in China, droughts everywhere, lakes drying up, permafrost cracking; warming is to blame. The ice shelves melting down not just raises water levels but endangers animals that live within and while those living on ice would just drown. Ecological damage affects reproduction of migratory birds which earlier coincided with caterpillars. With both peaking at different intervals, birds now go without food and beetles are damaging crops. Many cities were set up above line of mosquitoes, are now face risk of diseases. Showing that there are concerns bigger than terrorism too, Gore also highlights growth in world population to emissions. Relatively America, Europe, Russia and Indo-China contribute to 20, 28, 13 &amp; 12 percent to global emissions. Critiquing lack of adequate action by the Bush Administration, he quotes Jon Sinclair &#x201c;It is difficult to get a man to understand something when his salary depends upon his not understanding it&#x201d;Churchill&#x2019;s old quote is now a warning to the world &#x201c;The era of procrastination, of half-measures, of soothing and baffling expedients, of delays, is coming to a close. In its place, we are entering a period of consequences&#x201d; looms large. Gore closes it saying it is our time to rise and secure our future so that kids don&#x2019;t think why our parents didn&#x2019;t wake up then? Shaken you up, you are asked: Are you ready to change the way we live?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The robot ex-vice president, Al Gore, actually came to life to lead an education campaign on the dangers of global warming. He is shown on a road trip from city to city, presenting a slide show which uses charts, graphs, and photographs of Earth from various space missions. He points out that climate change is not a political issue, but a moral one. The film is well made, and anyone with the least amount of common sense will agree that we have destroyed a good portion of the world with our lifestyles, especially here in America, with our big SUV's and Mcmansions. The Polar Ice caps are melting, the seas rising, and temperatures increasing yearly, as we spew more and more carbon gases into the atmosphere. Seven billion plus inhabit the planet, and as we add to this number, the death of our home inevitable. At least be informed as to how it all happened, and why. An Inconvenient Truth is just that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Uses Intelligence Rather Than Fear</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Former vice president Al Gore shares his concerns on the pressing issue of global warming in this documentary entitled,An Inconvenient Truth.This was directed by Davis Guggenheim about Gore's campaign to educate citizens about global warming via a comprehensive slide show that, by his own estimate, he has given more than a thousand times.A long-time environmental activist, Gore first became aware of evidence on global warming in the 1970s, and since leaving public office he has become a passionate advocate for large- and small-scale changes in our laws and lifestyles that could help alleviate this crisis. An Inconvenient Truth records a multi-media presentation hosted by Gore in which he discusses the scientific facts behind global warming, explains how it has already begun to affect our environment, talks about the disastrous consequences if the world's governments and citizens do not act, and shares what each individual can do to help protect the Earth for this and future generations.This documentary can be described as a film that invests hard science with impassioned moral drive.It is a powerful film about a man determined to educate the public about the issue of global warming.While global warming is a hotly-debated subject, what everyone on both sides can agree upon is that, if real, it's a very bad thing. Since losing the 2000 presidential election to George W. Bush, Gore has busied himself by being an outspoken figure against this potential environmental disaster. As much about the man as about greenhouse gases, this candid, powerful and informative documentary illuminates some of the myths surrounding both of its subjects equally well.And this film obviously fulfills its objective as it uses intelligence rather than fear in the arguments it presents.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Confused</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I recently read Michael Crichton's "State Of Fear." Last night I watched Al Gore's "Inconvenient Truth." Neither man is an extremist or a rabble rouser. Both are well motivated and have good credentials. Both stand accused of jiggling their data selectively, And we get two directly opposite views. There are more questions than answers. What prompted Crichton to debunk climate change? What prompted Gore to make a movie about it? Is it perhaps early days in another bid for the US presidency? Is Crichton just being a contrarian? The amazing thing, certainly a reflection of public concern on the issue, is the immense popularity of Gore's film which, although well done, is essentially two hours of his talking head. I tried twice to rent it at my local video store. On one occasion, a mid week day, all of the 11 copies were out. It would have been nice had there been some mention of Canada. But then we're accustomed to being ignored up here. There has been a raging debate in Canada over Kyoto. The much vaunted Alberta tar sands are a major contributor to North American green house gasses (as well as water depletion.) Parts of Ontario, including the resort areas of Georgian Bay, Muskoka and Algonquin Park, now get heavy smog in the summer that originates in the American midwest. Nor was there much on the horrific air pollution in China and other parts of Asia, traces of which are recorded in our upper atmosphere, borne east by the jet stream. My own view? It's a combination of factors; a natural cycle exacerbated by green house gasses. Watch it. But also read Crichton's book. Maybe you'll be able to sort things out better than I have.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Before watching this movie I was very supportive of Al Gore's case; like everyone else I'm not against the environment. But this manipulative pseudo-scientific power-point presentation almost makes me wanna spray as much CO2 in the atmosphere as possible. He shows how a glacier melts in only 35 days. Of course it melts; it's spring. It'll grow back next winter. He takes 30 years of scientific data and extrapolates it over thousands of years. And the accident Al Gore's son had in 1989, however tragic it may have been, has absolutely nothing to do with the story. Just like many other scenes it's only there for sentimental purposes. So even though the message of this movie is worth telling, I despise the way it's presented.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Educationally this documentary intrigued me and fulfilled somewhat of a knowledge gap in my understanding of the topic, Global Warming. Some people criticize this documentary as being more of a political campaign than an educational warning. I would argue against this statement but offer the thought provoking question of 'should this not be a political campaign?'As many other reviews have stated, this documentary touches on multiple mentally stimulating opinions and facts, but overall fails to provide complete evidence of all statements made. Especially in regards to the information provided around the 'exclusive' studies discussed. Who are the 'friends' and 'small groups of scientists' that gathered this data? One investigative element when determining what is correct or incorrect is the ability to acknowledge the source as being trustworthy or not. In this regard the majority of studies, polls or pictures do not provide a source, logically provoking the assumption that all evidence has been tampered with in some way, to manipulate the desired result and influence on the presentation.Elements of the documentary that i found extremely inessential were the cuts about Al Gore's life. It seemed irrelevant and frustrated me when the attempt to connect it with the presentation failed immensely. Which occurred in the majority of the cut scenes, creating a sense of scenic segregation (the feeling of watching two different documentaries mashed together).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The overall impact of this film is like a re-charge of the brain, like being punched in the stomach, like having a few ants running up your bare arms and into your sleeves. This may sound like a negative explanation, but this film is not nearly as negative as it may sound. Re-charging of the brain is a good feeling, is it not? Being punched in the stomach and having ants crawling up your arms are two prospects that are not really positive in any way (unless you are having the heimlich manoevure done on you or unless are a person who worships ants and thinks it is an honour to having them crawl up you as if they know that you love them). But these prospects, if you are a person who already cares for the environment anyway, or does NOT believe that global warming is a MYTH, will make being punched in the stomach like a bitter realization and urge to save the planet even more, and will make ants crawling up your back a frightening realization that, again, the earth can be helped more by you.Yet, it seems that, even people who have watched this film, still believe global warming is a myth and will not receive any kind of urge to help the earth even more. This is shocking. Al Gore clearly demonstrates what is happening and has happened to the earth, because of our seemingly uncontrollable pressure we are putting on the planet. People who do not believe anything he says, easy as some parts are to understand, are obviously horrible, selfish, misguided people - and who can also be stupid. This last sentence is as purely an honest account as could be made by myself.I personally think that Al Gore does very well in explaining the problems happening on our planet and showing the affects of what could happen if we do not change our ways soon enough. He presents it in a way which can be understood by a great deal of people, apart from those very very annoying people in the world who will just not believe. Er... Hello...? Engage brain..!Another thing I like about this film is that even though Al Gore explains many negative views in the film, he also addresses the positive points as well. Like explaining how you can change the world "Recycle" etc. These positive points like "Recycle" are obvious to me. What I find shocking about many people all over the world (not just including people who have not believed this film) know that they can recycle and they know about it - but they just do not. This is an almost horrifying prospect to me and I admire anyone who shares this feeling with me.I recommend this film to people who wish to know more about the environment, people who are studying the environment and people who CARE about the environment. People who do not care for the environment should not watch this, as it just presents more negative saying about this film, which should not happen at all.P.S The reason I have rated this 9 rather than 10 is because I found the length of this film almost too much to deal with, I prefer lighter and shorter things. But this is hardly a negative comment on the film, only the reason why I did not give it an extra star.P.P.S I know I have repeated myself on many points in this review, but I AM JUST TRYING TO REACH THE MESSAGE ACROSS! :-)</fullReview>

Basically this movie is a filmed slideshow environmental conference hosted by Al Gore intercut with a portrait of Al Gore, his life and career. The conference is obviously the more interesting part of this documentary and the main draw of the movie.As the host, Al Gore is excellent, frequently using humor but never letting the viewer forget how serious the issue at hand is. He is extremely convincing and brings up a number of very interesting points (being environment conscious does not mean lesser financial profit, for example). Do not not watch this movie if you're not a liberal, it is not "bullshit liberal propaganda", it is not political. This a movie which transcends politics and national borders.This is a movie which should be given a chance by everyone, even if you don't usually watch documentaries.

		<fullReview>I expected this to be a documentary version of his slideshow, but it is a slideshow presentation that was filmed, mixed in with some autobiographical content that really belongs in a separate film. Gore's presentation is on the whole highly polished and quite informative, even just to frame knowledge you may already have in a new way. I didn't treat everything he said as gospel, but one internet poster's complaint about the scales he used appeared to be incorrect. For example, the parts per million graph if displayed in full shows a small change, but what we do with scales is change them to something meaningful (as anyone who's done high school maths will know). Running through my mind as I watched this is that it's not change that's the problem, it the rate of change that's the problem. If the sea level noticeably rises and rainfall rates change over the course of one lifetime, this is very disruptive. As a government insider Gore has a unique perspective, for example on the US's fuel economy targets, which lag behind even some developing nations, and formerly classified Naval data on the Artctic ice sheet thickness. He's also picked a great selection of quotes that are quite cutting in regard to the oil industry and global warming deniers.The presentation ended on quite a manipulative note though, attempting to inspire us to make change rather than letting the previous 50 minutes speak for themselves. I think a documentary like this by a former politician requires fact checking to be viewed comfortably (just did a little). Despite Gore's bias, at worst he's close to the mark. It's got me thinking about the subject again and I hope the human race pumps less carbon dioxide into the atmosphere and burns less undisturbed wilderness before even the most ardent global warming denier accepts the accumulating evidence.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I will not discuss the details, particularly the scientific details and methods. There are a few things that are not entirely acceptable. For one and only instance he manipulates facts when he pretends no scientific voice has spoken in doubt of the global warming theory. Richard Lindzen who is an important climatologist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology has widely and wildly spoken against it. But he is true on one fact. There is no reason to do something that could be harmful in a way or another and that we can avoid. Going against pollution and carbon mono- and dioxide emission is ethically good because there is no reason why we should pollute and emit carbon mono- and dioxides unnecessarily. This is also economically wise because there is no reason why we should produce waste since then waste-processing is an economic cost that will cripple the economy in a very short period of time. He is also right on another thing. It is a political issue and it has to be dealt with as such. But the film is not even a documentary. It lacks several elements to be one. For one it does not provide an opportunity to anyone to speak: it is a monologue. For two it does not provide an opportunity to anyone to dissent with the only point of view that is defended here. In other words it is perfect propaganda, advertising, and nothing else. Even worse, the term of truth is irritating to the utmost. We are not looking for truth because truth does not exist. There are only points of view. So we have to convince people and to do so we have to be balanced and listen to other points of view and not to impose one point of view by unilaterally calling it truth. And anyway when that truth becomes A truth that means there are more than one, but then they are not truth, they are points of view. The same remark goes for the direct quotation of the Book of Revelation, also known as the Apocalypse. Any apocalyptic vision is to be rejected if we want to work on the reason of people and not on their fear. Any ethical decision is ethical only if it is based on conviction and not on fear. Al Gore, in a nice tone, with a cool intonation, spreads fear with even some symbolical elements like the Twin Towers Memorial being underwater if his apocalyptic prediction turns true. At least that is what Milton taught me three centuries ago. Even worse again. How dare he quote Winston Churchill speaking of Hitler and Nazism to speak of climate change and the apocalypse he is announcing? That is gross, un-respectful of the people who fought against Hitler who was not a simple tornado and was slightly more systematic in his apocalyptic bulldozing of the world than a hurricane would be. Bad taste indeed. His knowledge of history is also particularly warped. He attributes all positive elements to the US, including the French Revolution ? who was a great blood bath by the way ? but he forgets to attribute the two atomic mushrooms that ever exploded over a city to the United States in violation of the Yalta agreement: then he becomes general and the fault is nicely laid down on the threshold of humanity in general. It is also by far too personal, nearly a life story, and definitely the political allusions about recent presidential elections and other events are out of place in a documentary on climate change, and it destroys some more the ambition of this film to be a documentary. But it sure will lead to constant and wide debates on the question of global warming.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne &amp; University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines</fullReview>

If he found select anthropologists to proof text his positions I would care even less. Experts are everywhere these days. . .newscasts, courtrooms, city counsel meetings, etc. An "ex" is a has been and a "spurt" is a drip under pressure. That's the definition of experts with regard to movies like this.Experts have so enlightened me in my lifetime. In 1967 I was told by experts used by the media that air pollution would kill everyone in 20 years--no stopping it. In 1974 I was told by experts that in 20 years the world oil supply would be gone--kaput! In 1977 I was told we were entering a new ice age. In the early 80's I heard that the ozone layer was being destroyed and that skin cancer would be the death of us all.And now for another "Inconvenient Truth." Yes, we may be seeing climate change--but there has always been climate change and it is more dynamic that anything humans would have aspired to do to change or stop it. I'm sure our primitive ancestors who chased mammoths on the glaciers which covered much of North American would have loved to hunt in the sun and fun. Their descendants got to do so without even one Republican caucus intervening. Of course, by then the mammoths were gone but buffalo proved a tasty substitute (sorry to you PETA folks but my canine teeth tell me I'm a carnivore).Now, I, too, am tired of the left always waving their arms in panicked exclamation. The evidence is hardly in, and even if Manhattan is under water in 20 years, I'm sure we will adapt just like our Mammoth hunting forebears who had no one to blame for the climate change.However, in 20 years I think it is more likely that the Mets and Yankees are still playing in the New York, and Manhattan will still be just a subway ride away. In those days to come our living descendants will have movie nights where they watch "Reefer Madness" and "An Inconvenient Truth" for the shear fun of seeing how panicky the modern left had become.

		<fullReview>I had heard lots of raving reviews for this documentary, but had missed it in the theatres in Amsterdam. I regretted that, and was eager to see the movie sometime. Today I saw the documentary, and let me say that I am not a Republic, nor an American, nor a Westerner, nor a Scientist. I am just a one of the audience from a developing country, who gets worried of the way we are destroying this world and would like to do something to save our planet.The documentary is about 100 minutes long and 70 percent of it is about creating fear in the minds of Americans showing all the possible data about how the planet is getting destroyed. The data and information in the documentary is presented nicely in very good visuals - making it simple and easy to understand. One gets convinced that surely the world is on a brink of major global disaster. I was much interested in the last 30 minutes when Al Gore the main protagonist of the documentary starts talking about the solutions. He presents three solutions ? population control, technology advancement and energy saving. And I found that there he fails to solve the global problem. It was too superficial and typical American ? scratching the surface and thinking that they will be able to change the souls.Al Gore's analogy of frog getting boiled in a slowing increasing temperature was so misrepresented ? because unlike humans - frogs do not destroy anything for their survival. Gore came very close to saying the INCONVENIENT TRUTH, when he showed the balance with gold on one plate and planet on the other. But his presentation blew that key slide away. He said that - it was the choice economies had to make in compared to saving our planet.I think after 20 years of studying environmental related facts ? Gore still remains an American and trapped in the mentality of thinking about Americans as super-power. Gore was arrogance to say call for Americans to save this world ? just like Hollywood movies like "Independence Day".Still I think for common people ? it would be an interesting educational movie. For children ? only after some more editing - it could become a necessary viewing in educational institutions.At certain points in the movie ? I could not stop laughing when Al Gore showed his "energy consuming life-style" and proudly stating the names of world cities and showing himself as a globe trotter? emitting enormous amounts of carbon-dioxide and contributing to global warming.Being an American, Al Gore could not stop being marketing himself high and moral! Being a politician ? and a democrat ? he could not stop being taking a shot at republicans! Being a westerner ? he could not stop showing fingers at India and China's growing population! And lastly being an elite ? he could not stop preaching energy consumption messages world over ? to everyone! (5 Stars)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Almost Perfect Political Marketing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Al Gore presents this outstanding documentary about the effects of the global warming that will certainly be his flag for the next North American election to the White House. I do not trust on politicians, but the flag of defending our planet must be the individual objective of every human being; therefore this documentary is a must see to be promoted to every friend or acquaintance of each viewer, inclusive in schools and universities. The presentation discloses, like in a seminar, a compilation of scientific data about the degradation of Earth and the effects of the global warming along the centuries, highlighting in the last decades. Further, it gives a pessimist projection for the next decades unless the world in general and particularly USA do not change the relationship and concerns with the health of Earth. His presentation is almost perfect, but unfortunately he uses and entwines footages of personal dramas of the Gore family, such as the accident of his six year old son and the death of his sister by lung cancer, as metaphoric examples with the global warming issue, but actually it is a sentimentalism to move the electors, revealing a family-man politician in a visible political marketing. There are excellent lines, and I would like to highlight the following ones: "It is difficult to get a man to understand something when his salary depends upon his not understanding it". "Doing the right thing move us forward". "When you pray, move your feet" (African proverb). "Political win is a renewable resource". Congratulations to Mr. Al Gore for his brilliant presentation of this moral issue, but he should have kept the global warming issue on focus without the insertion of his personal biography to give more credibility to his concern. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): 'Uma Verdade Inconveniente" ("An Inconvenient Truth")</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Global Honesty Debate Warms Up</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Global catastrophes have pummeled Earth and its inhabitants more so recently than in other times as recalled by our collective memory, opening vast opportunities for the cinematic community to chip in with its different takes on the issue.Consequently, nature and ecology-related releases previously relegated to home video and/or television media have been finding their way increasingly onto commercial exhibitors of mainstream motion pictures.It wasn't too long ago we beheld March of the Penguins (also known as Emperor's Journey), a nature flick packing potent emotional relevance for human viewers, and now here comes what essentially amounts to a traditional documentary-cum-travelogue, or a variety of product previously undesired by theaters busying themselves with money-making blockbusters.However, a sensitized audience ever more concerned with gas prices and worldwide climatic transformation has made it possible to place An Inconvenient Truth alongside The Da Vinci Code and M:I:3. The result is thought provoking as intended, but not the unbiased triumph we would have hoped for, since its creators' agenda does creep into proceedings more than the bare minimum mandates.Director David Guggenheim does well, having cut his teeth on a host of high-caliber TV projects like Party of Five, Alias and Deadwood. He helms a 100 minute-long look at former US vice-president Al Gore's world-hugging travels in promotion of CO2 emission reduction, a bid described by Gore himself as desperate and one set against a ticking time bomb embodied by rising sea levels and temperatures.We follow Gore from locale to locale as he eloquently demonstrates the dangers faced by humanity, using some animation and lots of low-key, subtle exposure of various landscapes. Gore is seen visiting China, for example, and his ancestral farm, where he grew up learning first hand about tobacco as an economic engine and health hazard.Unlike what some have been expecting, Truth doesn't cover a wide spectrum of environmental issues, but rather focuses almost exclusively on greenhouse gasses and the current state of energy production. One memorable sequence superimposes higher sea levels on Google Earth images of major world cities, chillingly visualizing the devastating effects such an eventuality will have on our civilization.Other highlighted segments include sentimental, but not mushy, iconic images of mother Earth observed from space, with Gore, in his droning but all the same caring monotone, reminding people that there's really nowhere else to go.Although dealing with a tremendous topic, Truth avoids deploying overtures, hyperbole or major clichs, and throughout maintains a personal instead of bombastic approach. The camera pans close to its subject matter, goes in and out of focus, shies away from grand visages. In total, the effect bring to mind borderline-indie pictures like Sofia Coppola's Lost in Translation and Michael Winterbottom's superb but rarely seen Code 46.An Inconvenient Truth likewise boasts no top-dollar effects to dazzle you with, hoping to sway the opinions of those in attendance by simply putting forth what most of us already know, yet opt to ignore because acknowledgement is indeed inconvenient to our present lifestyle.Thankfully, there's little of the horse-flogging so traditional with preachy items of this ilk. Gore doesn't point fingers at anyone in particular, yet succeeds in letting us know precisely who's to blame for each problem denoted. This is because Truth covers familiar territory. It does not reveal any hitherto unknown facts about climate change, nor shatter staunchly held misconceptions, save maybe for its outright conclusion that debating humanity's impact on the environment is a moot point. Gore claims there's no question as to whether we are influencing our own habitat by way of technology, a quandary of syntax more than factual validity.An Inconvenient Truth's greatest contribution lies in being a pleasant wakeup call, poking folks with painful realities without the thorny criticism and ensuing guilt-trip. Of course, having a seasoned speaker like Al Gore helps a lot, and it's easy to listen to him explain those things we'd like to forget knowing.What's not so effortless for them is maintaining credibility, and when Gore comes out and says now mainland China has higher environmental standards than the US things begin to fall apart, as anyone who's ever been to both parts of the world knows full well. Such sweeping statements go against the otherwise subdued grain of the project, and serve as one more post-it note: that perhaps there's another agenda running in the background.We're not saying Gore's clamoring for another go at the White House, but certainly something's afoot, especially with the obviously positive play China gets in the documentary, with not even a peep out about its repeated environmental disasters, poor enforcement, rampant development and otherwise dismal track record when it comes to issues of ecology.All that goes on to the tune of denouncing American and other Western societies as chiefly responsible for adverse environmental changes, and while this too is handled with care and laid-back class, it's discordant nonetheless and indicative of a hidden current bubbling under An Inconvenient Truth's supposedly benign surface.Hence, this comes to pass as a public-minded exercise demanding cautious respect from observers. Go watch it for the prime relevance it has on your life and the lives those who will come after. Watch it so you can hear some elements of the truth, particularly those we should be conscious of but elect to ignore.Don't watch Truth with a gullible mind, and keep ready that all-important salt shaker, it'll come in useful once taking what Gore says in perspective becomes as imperative as ingesting the responsibility we all have for our common fate on this blue planet.From stylish presentation to ludicrously banal environmental tips upon closing ("recycle", "buy en electric car"), Truth still defies grading. It gets the job done even when devoid of bona fide revelation, achieving goals in a rational manner while wanton activism tempts, and that is impressive.Rating: * * * ?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wouldn't call this movie a "film" so much as a "forum" in which Gore is given the ability to inform the public at large of a very REAL problem that our earth is facing.The hard facts and plain-as-day graphs are shocking to those who have not done research on global warning. But, all these facts are perfectly complemented by a quirky, humorous demeanor (believe it or not) and an overall sense of optimism.I went from feeling fairly uninformed about global warming to feeling as though each of us as individuals can truly make a difference and participate in promoting change from the ground up.I left with the understanding that global warming is a pertinent problem that we need to address for the sake of saving lives, and also for maintaining the same comfortable level of life we have learned to live in our lifetime and for generations beyond.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's time to tell the truth. This is probably the best well-known power-point presentation ever. Still, there were some flaws</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While, I give the movie credited for raising international public awareness of global warming and reenergizing the environmental movement. There were still plenty of inconvenient truth omitted in former U.S Vice President, Al Gore critically-acclaimed, scientifically-controversial documentary. Directed by Davis Guggenheim, the title stems from a quote stating that people will not believe something, even if it is true, and their livelihoods might depend on it. While, I wouldn't call myself, a 'global warming skeptic', since I kinda do believe in some of the information that Al Gore is, trying to say, and it's hard to prove against global warming, otherwise, but I do have an understandment, that documentaries like this, might have some sequences that can be somewhat subjective and placed selectively to fit into a wider narrative drive. This movie is full of scenes like that. Some good examples is the scenes, where Al Gore tells the story of his sister dying from lung cancer, and how doctors at the time, believe, cigarette smoking was pretty harmless. Don't get me wrong, it's an interesting, yet somewhat sad story, but it has little to do with global warming, in my opinion. It's a little too broad. There is a more awkward section, later on, where Gore explains his decision, to turn his attention to environment reform. He stated out, the reason, he did this, was because, the fact, that his young son was nearly killed in a car accident in 1989. First off, while, it might be somewhat odd for him to decide to do something about the culture, because of unrelated incident that has little to nothing to do with climate control; my big problem with his statement is that he didn't do much, environment reform with President Clinton, until 1997 with the Kyoto Protocol. That's nearly 8 years, after the fact. I wish, Al Gore would be, more honest with his failures. Another moment in the film, is how Gore talks non-stop about, how he lose the 2000 election. Once again, what does all this political talk, have to do with saving the environment!? Could we please, focus on the main problem in hand, here? Thank you. The movie really does leans too hard on sentimental devices, as Gore looks repeatedly look like the victim of bad luck. The black and white images and sad music feel more exploitative than explanatory. I really didn't like, how the film uses emotive images of Hurricane Katrina and the freakiest 2005 Hurricane season as a reason to claim it, was done by global warming. The reason why is because the 2005 Hurricane season was a one-off event. Since, 2005, the hurricane seasons around the world has somewhat turn back into normal, pre-2005 level of active hurricanes in a given season. Another misleading fact, is how film threatens that global warming could stop the Gulf Stream throwing Europe into an ice age. Most scientists now, claim that this was more scientific and mathematically impossible, because the fact that the Gulf Stream works in such a rapid pace, due to the gravitation pull and the melting ice is way too slow in thawing to catch up with it. Another big mistake is how the film suggests that evidence from ice cores proves that rising CO2 causes temperature increases over 650,000 years. However, the film was a bit misleading with that. It's over that period, the rises in CO2 lagged behind the temperature rises by 800-2000 years. Still, I did like the sequence where Al Gore needed a lift to show where the CO2 graph was going, in how funny, it was, not because how factual, it was. Indeed, Gore documentary was so controversial that in October 2007 the High Court in London found 'nine errors' in its scientific proclamations. Subsequently, a host of scientists around the world began filing law suits against Gore's film for its various other errors. Despite the errors, that I point out, one of my biggest problems with the film is how hypocritical, Al Gore can be. He is a carbon billionaire, and yes, I do believe his profiting way too much from his own environment advocacy. If he wasn't, why is his speaking fee more than $100,000!? That's way too much for somebody that says, that they cares so much for the environment. Not only that, but he has an alleged conflict of interest from his role as both an investor in green-technology companies and as an advocate of taxpayer-funded green-technology subsidies. Also, it's really hard to take his advice on limiting waste and population control, when he has 4 children and waste way too much, on private fuel jetting around the world, speaking in global warming conventions. Then, there is his home personality lifestyle; owning multiply large houses do not exactly scream "environmental moderation". Still, you have to give it to Gore. He indeed gave a wonderful, extravagant power point presentation of skyscraper graphs, pie charts, diagrams, etc. here. Despite all, the flaws that I have pointed out, I do agree with some of the film's claims. Claims like the melting snows on Mount Kilimanjaro, Antarctica, and others could be evidence of global warming, because it does match up with the widespread glacier retreat in mid-to-low latitudes across the globe. I also agree with him, on the examples of man-made environmental disasters like bad agriculture, mining practices, and bad irrigation projects. However, the film is blemish, a bit because how already dated, this film is, and the fact that not all the informative presented here, are scientific proved. Overall: While, this film introduces complicated scientific, political, and social issues, very well, it's clear, that more research, need to be done, to get a better understanding of what global warming is, and what we can do, about it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Director Davis Guggenheim films Al Gore giving a presentation about Global Warming to an audience. He was introduced to rising CO2 emission levels by his college professor Roger Revelle. He has been fighting to bring the issue to the political world. In this, he explains the issues, the scientific evidence and the possible solutions.This is an important environmental movie. The problem with most of these type of movies is that they are preaching to the choir. This one lays out the evidence in easy to understand bites. After years of dry back-and-forth political and scientific arguments, this is the turning point where the denier community is forced to react to the movie. This is a slick understandable presentation. No matter which side you're on, this is a powerful movie that you either love or hate.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Solution but not one many will seriously support</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is simple, the atmosphere is absorbing solar heat and not re-radiating due to the presence of carbon dioxide. So reduction of volume of Carbon Dioxide or reduction of Solar energy reaching the Earth is necessary. Now we can do only a small amount in reducing carbon dioxide: but we can easily reduce solar heat reaching the Earth. We were warned of "Nuclear Winter" in the cold war era. why not use our capability to scatter some fine light dust such as "Fly-ash" residue from burning coal, using our Rocket Technology putting the dust beyond 21,000 miles out past the TV satellites so it won't fall back down. A few thousand tons could balance the heating effects we are experiencing. It is that or a few Nuclear devices set off on the surface to throw dust high into the uppermost regions will cure our overheating for a couple hundred years until our technology progresses to provide a permanent solution.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Inconvenient Truth...First of all, I thought the movie was quite good, but some of the points were a bit misguided. The message of the movie is one that everyone should take note of...that global warming is happening. It is not my 'opinion' that the earth is getting warmer globally due to human production of greenhouse gasses, it is a scientifically excepted fact. No researchers, trained in studying climate, disagree that we aren't causing the earth to warm unnaturally. So please go ahead and check the background of the 'scientists' who deny global warming. Most of the time they are scientists, but trained in completely different areas than climate science and therefore have no experience or knowledge to make statements against global warming.I think the movie probably spends a bit too much time on Al Gore's life, but the part about global warming is quite well done. The only thing I can say is that stating that specific incidences of weather are due to global warming is not very accurate. Due to global warming, there will be greater chances that extreme weather will occur, but to say that any specific event was due to global warming just guessing.Everyone just needs to understand that global warming is happening. It is not an 'opinion,' it is a well studied scientific phenomenon, and again, no real climate scientist denies this. Don't listen to the random and misinformed dissenters of global warming who give this movie one star ratings, remember that the scientists, who spend their lives studying climate and climate change are the only ones qualified to make statements about global warming, and everything I have written in this post is based on such scientific material (I have taken a couple university courses on climate dealing with the global warming science) Thanks for reading.</fullReview>

However, as someone who has studied geography, Al Gore leaves out a vast majority of facts in climate predictions and IPCC-theories. By mainly relying on the Hockey Stick Curve, he's already reduced to an eye-roll worthy politician in the eyes of people with a pinch of more geographical knowledge than FOX News.I'd argue he gives his audience such a small presentation of the facts, and by leaving out so many theories and general geographical knowledge,He presents his case to suit his political agenda, which makes him a good politician.

		<fullReview>Director Davis Guggenheim eloquently weaves the science of global warming with Mr. Gore's personal history and lifelong commitment to reversing the effects of global climate change. A longtime advocate for the environment, Gore presents a wide array of facts and information in a thoughtful and compelling way. "Al Gore strips his presentations of politics, laying out the facts for the audience to draw their own conclusions in a charming, funny and engaging style, and by the end has everyone on the edge of their seats, gripped by his haunting message," said Guggenheim. An Inconvenient Truth is not a story of despair but rather a rallying cry to protect the one earth we all share. "It is now clear that we face a deepening global climate crisis that requires us to act boldly, quickly, and wisely," said Gore. This Movie Is A Documentary With Flaws. Yep FLAWS IN A DOCUMENTARY. As An Example When Al Gore Shows The Slide Of the Ice Core Graph At The Beginning Of The Movie, The Numbers On The Y-Axis Are Wrong - The Average Is At 0.5, &amp; The Negative Numbers Are Flipped. The Slide Is Wrong &amp; Therefore Misleading. Okay Before People Start Clicking No To The "Did You Find This Review Useful?" Question I Am Not One Of Those @$$holes That Say "Global Warming Is A Bunch Of Crap" I'm Just Saying This Movie Makes People More Worried About The Globe Heating But At The Least It'll Probably Happen About...Say 2300. I'm Not Saying "Hey Stop Worrying You'll Be Fine" It Is A Serious Issue Because You Don't Want Your Descendants To Die At Technically Your Own Hands But Al Gore To Me Makes People A Little Bit More Worried. His Little Speech About Battling This Issue At The End Was Correct: "Future Generations May Well Have Occasion To Ask Themselves, "What Were Our Ancestors Thinking? Why Didn't They Wake Up When They Had A Chance?" We Have To Hear That Question From Them, Now". Also This Movie Also Proves How Dumb George Bush Is He Had A Picture Of A Scale Even Holding 6 Gold Bars *Hmmm Those Bars Sure Looked Good* &amp; On The Other Side The Entire Planet. Now I Don't Have A Degree In Logicity But...Would You Choose The Entire Planet? Thought So. Judging On The Future Years Of President Bush He Chose The Gold Bars. Now I'm Not Saying This Movie Is Complete Bullsh-- But Its Not As Serious As...You Know "Hey In 2012 The Earth's Crust Will Melt".

		<fullReview>This piece of celluloid won awards? It's not a documentary, it's a political diatribe in a documentary format. To be effective, a documentary has to be be objective; that is not the case here. Instead, a disgruntled politician with an ax to grind uses the documentary format to attack his political opponent. Is mankind responsible for global warming? Maybe, maybe not. Al Gore is not a scientist and is no more of an expert on this issue then the next guy or gal, yet he is sounding the alarm, as if he's the only one in the know. We don't need Al Gore to alert us about climate change. It's an old story and one that he has co-opted to discredit his political opponents. Well, he has a right to voice his opinion, but that's all it is, an opinion and his carries no more weight than anybody else. This "documentary" claims that scientists are unanimous in the belief that man-made global warming is a fact, yet he neither cites any specific scientists nor does he provide a list of sources backing up his assertions. Instead Mr. Gore expects the audience to believe him. Beware of the politician who is pushing a cause. Such activity always masks a hidden agenda, one that is self-serving. From vice-president to environmental shill, that seems to summarize the career of Al Gore.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"An Inconvenient Truth" is Al Gore's message to the world about the threat of global warming. Gore's presentation is bolstered by facts, which he usually lets speak for themselves.The documentary's style closely follows Gore's tried-and-true Keynote presentation given many times around the world. At intervals there are some more personal observations from Gore that show why he is passionate about this cause. There's nothing really special about the documentary's technique but I did like the way that the closing credits gave suggestions on doing something about the cause that you'd just learned about.The topic of global warming is certainly not edge-of-your-seat material but Gore &amp; company do a pretty good job of keeping it interesting. There is no shortage of facts and, as the saying goes, a picture is worth a thousand words. I could have done without the Gore family reflections but I understand that they are meant to connect the concerns of global warming to the people who are affected by it.This is a thoughtful documentary and I appreciate the fact that Gore lets the facts speak for themselves. Sure, there are glimpses of what we could be headed for but where some might see opportunities for scare-mongering, Gore sees opportunities for improvement. Hopefully this documentary raises awareness to such a level that politicians can no longer ignore the issue.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As an educational film, "Truth" is effective and eye-opening</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What's the best way to teach the general public, especially in America, about a serious and often misunderstood issue? Make a movie. Al Gore and director David Guggenheim figured it out with "An Inconvenient Truth," a film about the global warming crisis that is part documentary, part video lecture. As a documentary that weaves in Gore's life in attempt to give some emotional depth to the facts, it kind of seems pointless at times, but as an educational film, "Truth" is certainly effective in explaining global warming and empowering the viewer to do something about it.Educationally, the footage of Gore's lectures and the technology at his disposal allow for a very clear although at times very statistical explanation of what global warming is, what causes it, how it affects the planet and what we can do about it. The evidence, while sometimes confusing in the form of charts, is strong and eye-opening. Gore certainly demonstrates his expertise on the subject.Dispersed throughout the film are Gore's reflections on different aspects of his life and career set to pictures, some of which pertains to global warming directly and some of which is supposed to relate metaphorically or symbolically. You can kind of tell why Guggenheim put in these different bits when he did, but sometimes they detract from the issue at hand. There's also several shots of Gore in cars, typing on his Apple PowerBook and waiting in line at airports, none of which, as you'd imagine, are the least bit captivating. So it's hard to decipher if we're supposed to feel pity for Gore or merely get a sense of who he is politics and the 2000 presidential election aside. In general though, the knowledge aspect is quite strong in this film. While it would have benefited from more than just video lectures and actually taken us out to locations to see some specific examples of the impact of global warming, there is plenty to learn and understand that will change your perspective (or enhance it) on environmental issues.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Who would have thought Al Gore could hold our attention for an entire film? The man we thought was boring speaks with conviction and ease about a topic that affects all human beings and the fate of our future. An Inconvenient Truth is a tough film to review because like any political film you have to objective to the film-making and not the message. I don't agree with Al Gore on all of his issues but I feel he has put together a well made blueprint for the green movement which affects people of all political affiliations.My fear walking into An Inconvenient Truth was that Gore would place blame on the Republicans for the problem and further polarize this issue which should not be polarized and he does to a degree. We see footage of Bush, Reagan and Dubya giving their own take on the issues of global warming. I really wish Gore wouldn't have done this, but I guess it's his nature as a politician. Al Gore's name is the only real thing plaguing people from seeing this film which is a must see even if you see it to be objective. We are seeing Al Gore the politician but he is giving a heartfelt speech on something that is beyond politics. People have complained that the film is merely a power point presentation but I find that the film benefits from showing Gore interact with his audiences and showing their reactions to the data.The data is there and there is no disputing it. I think few can argue that global warming is a real problem but the fact is I wish Gore had done more to inspire his audience to the cause. We are getting a fire and brimstone talk of world's end. I wanted to know how I could save mother earth. Gore should have devoted a section of his speech to offer methods of how the middle class could help the reduction of greenhouse gases. What Gore does propose is change on a huge global scale but the film could have been more productive if it gave tips on how the everyday worker could affect the environment.My real problem with the film are the cut away scenes. Gore has taken acting lessons and it's noticeable. He looks fake and inorganic. We have a staged phone call from a secretary telling him about a Bush administration EPA leader who worked for Mobil, it is painfully fake and lends venom to the people who say this film is propaganda.In truth it is propaganda but it doesn't have to be liberal propaganda. If we had someone charismatic and with no political affiliation give this show it probably wouldn't have the controversy and scrutiny it had</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More propaganda than truth</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am not a scientist and cannot agree with or refute any of Gore's statistics. I was a history major in college, and one thing I learned from my history professors is that good historians look at all sides of an issue. Some historians fail to follow this precept, and apparently some scientists (or politicians-turned-scientists) do likewise. Gore dismisses anyone who does not believe in global warming as an ostrich with his head in the sand, hiding from reality. Global warming is a theory, not a proved fact. It may be true, it may not. As I wrote above, I am in no position to take a firm stand. However, I am suspicious of anyone who condemns as stupid anyone who dares disagree with him. Gore has built a cult around global warming, and we all must believe or be ostracized. He tries to scare people into following his mantra using terrible statistics to prove his theories. Mark Twain (or perhaps someone else - the quote has been attributed to more than one person) said "There are three kinds of lies: lies, damned lies, and statistics." If you know a little something, you can prove anything with statistics. Again, I am not saying Gore is wrong or that he is lying, I am only saying that he would be more believable if he were not so smugly dismissive of those who disagree with his theories.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, Al Gore definitely landed on his feet, losing the presidential election gaining 30 pounds and growing a beard, or you could say he broke and the environmentalist crowd picked him up.So, about the movie, I'd say it was informational, I'm not discarding it. But by the time this documentary hit the theatres it was outdated and didn't present enough to convince many climate scientists of it's findings... Quite a bit about the climate is still unknown, so much so that anytime someone says they found "something that could be devastating", another person says, "well, it's actually quite mild", and if i write anything about sunspots, extremely slow ocean currents or how the eddy current viscosity isn't accounted for in the navier stokes equation resulting in a systematic error for every climate model, it would be out of date by the time it's read. Anyway, a lot of the stuff that's being said here isn't up for debate, because debate won't prove or disprove it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film was produced with the best intentions from Mr Gore and may convince many people with his scare tactics by showing all the worst case scenarios but he misses several key points, and although i can repeat what other reviews have written i shall only explain the one that struck out most prominently to me. Yes carbon dioxide emissions have risen in recent years, there is no denying that and temperatures have also risen, as expected in an interglacial period. But there is no mention as to why these two phenomenon are linked, probably because he has no proof. These two variables could be linked the other way around with higher temperatures causing higher levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide. This film, essentially and ego trip for the former vice president, became tedious less half way through because of Mr Gore reiterating the same point over and over. The use of gimmicks such as the polar bear scene rendered the film useless as a scientific exercise. I am not doubting Mr Gore's public speaking and persuasive skills because they are excellent but the presentation is lacking in substance. Perhaps if Mr Gore had spent more time explaining how we can combat the threat of global warming before the end credits rather than showing us how he has flown 1000 times around the world in first class exerting more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere then this film would have been more effective and persuade more educated people to believe in his cause.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A very good introduction to the idea of global warming by Al Gore.This movie will help bring awareness to an environmental issue that has been around for a while, yet, we seem to never do anything about it. Maybe something will be done when water from the oceans start lapping up on Congress's building doorstep.Al Gore does his best to keep things simple so that this movie can be consumed by anyone. At first he states that pollution is thickening the atmosphere and then at some point starts talking about carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide is not really pollution - its just the stuff that gets released when we burn fossil fuels, or breath. Yes, it is the stuff that causes the earth to become warmer when it is added to the atmosphere in large amounts.For those of you that are more interested in this subject now that you have seen this movie, I have another, much better movie for you to watch. Its called Crude, and I saw it on the History Channel. This movie will explain the Carbon Cycle and will explain how the oil formed and how the earth will deal with the fact that we are burning it. Its the best movie regarding this subject that I have ever seen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The errors in the movie - there are not many of them</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are several climate skeptics who have made lists of so-called errors in An Inconvenient Truth - the book and/or the movie. I have scanned the internet and other places to collect a list of 130 alleged errors - some of them called 'serious scientific errors'. I have then evaluated each alleged error carefully, and I end up with the conclusion that there are 3 errors and 7 flaws in the film. In the book there are a few more flaws, which makes a total of 14 flaws and errors. This is a very small amount of errors compared to those made by Bj?rn Lomborg in his books.So, there are indeed errors in the movie, but there are not many of them.

Gore points to the dangers of carbon monoxide emissions and there is some political gibes given by the former Vice President as well when we see former President Bush ridiculing the Clinton-Gore team on global warming several days before his defeat in 1992.Notice that the states that have attempted to do something regarding global warming are the very states that Mr.Gore carried in 2000. How coincidental.An informative piece of information even for those, such as myself, who never cared a bit about science either because I found it boring or had some miserable people teaching it 40 years ago.

Mr Gore shocks us with facts and statistics and leaves the viewer feeling quite jarred by the end. Some people have criticised the film for being "autobiographical" but again, being South African, I found the anecdotes about Mr Gore quite interesting and informative.

Al Gore, yes that Al Gore, delivers a profound perspective on the severity of the global warming problem via a cerebral &amp; clever presentation. I did not realize Gore had so much warmth; maybe this former dull politician has so much current hot charisma in him that he himself is contributing to the global warming problem. All kidding aside, Gore excels in educating on the various perspectives &amp; prognosis on global warming or as likes to better define it "the climate crisis". I also was fond of Melissa Etheridge's inspiring song "I Want to Wake Up" which ironically woke up the Academy enough to reward it with a Best Song Oscar. "An Inconvenient Truth" did run 15 minutes too long; enough for it to cause me to think that it had "too much Gore". Kidding Al! I still "gorify" you, I mean glorify you with "An Inconvenient Truth". So take out your "green" and purchase to view "An Inconvenient Truth". **** Good</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Inconvenient Truth offers a compelling look at what happens when we as people are not careful.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The plot of An Inconvenient Truth described in one sentence is: Ex-vice president Al Gore gives a slide show on the effects of global warming. That doesn't sound that interesting and seems to be quite boring. However, this documentary by Davis Guggenheim is actually quite fascinating and will make you think twice about whether to buy a Toyota or a Ford. Ever since losing the 2000 presidential election, Al Gore has been touring the world giving a slide show about global warming and how it harms the environment and the planet. He has given this presentation thousands of times before and has now decided to put it on film to give his plea for help wider distribution.Sure, it sounds extremely boring, but Gore and Guggenheim make it absolutely interesting and it also makes one think about how to improve the world. They use photographs, statistics, anecdotes and even a clip from the show Futurama to help explain their concern on the subject. I was somebody who thought that global warming wasn't a big issue. My reaction was "Isn't it a good thing that the Earth is getting hotter?" Well, An Inconvenient Truth has opened my eyes on the dangers of it. With ice constantly melting, the chances of seaside towns getting flooded are getting higher. Hurricane Katrina, that hit New Orleans in the summer of 2005, was also possibly a consequence of global warming. It is a serious issue that must be dealt with.There are some who will accuse An Inconvenient Truth of being propaganda, but despite the presence of a former Democratic candidate, this documentary is not about who you should vote for in the next election. This is a look at what can happen if people are not more careful about what they throw away and how they do it. The one major flaw that irked this reviewer was the jabs at President Bush and his administration by Gore. It's obvious that he feels a grudge about losing the election and that he thinks he could have handled September 11 better, but it would have been more professional if he kept his feeling on the current American leader to himself. Despite that, An Inconvenient Truth offers a compelling look at what happens when we as people are not careful.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Inconvenient Truth</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Al Gore and Director Davis Guggenheim did a fantastic job with this film. It is definitely a must see movie. An Inconvenient Truth is just as enlightening as it is frightening, it is the perfect film for those who know little about the topic or have heard about global warming but aren't really sure what it is or what to believe. First time viewers should prepare to be alarmed, this movie is quite the eye opener. Gore does an amazing job at showing viewers the noticeable affects of global warming through pictures, graphs, and scientific evidence. He opens up the show with a comedic gesture "Im Al Gore and I used to be the next president of the United states" which draws a good laugh from the crowd. He then goes on to explain the basic principles of Global Warming, he does this with the help of a funny clip from the popular TV show Futurama. Immediately from the beginning Gore pulls you in with his charm, detailed information, and a comedic prowess. Throughout the film Gore presents many eye opening charts and pictures that undeniably support the idea of global warming and climate change. Gore states, and I found this very interesting; that there are good people in politics in both parties, and these people keep global warming at arms reach because if they recognize and acknowledge it then then moral imperative to make dramatic changes will be inescapable. As Gore explains throughout this film; politicians have put this topic on the back burner for decades now, assuming the problem will take care of itself through the means of new technology, simply not believing in the matter, or focusing their attention on other matters. Gore used this quote from Winston Churchill which explains masterfully what we as the human race are getting ourselves into. He said " The era of procrastination, of half measures, of soothing and battling expedients, of delays is coming to a close. in its place we are entering a period of consequences." This quote contains a lot of truth, however Gore gives ways we can combat global warming. Global warming affects so many things on earth, more than just the temperature rising. Gore discusses the misconceptions that surround global warming and squashes those misconceptions in the process. All in all I recommend everyone watch this film, Gore presents the information in such an insightful and jaw dropping its hard not to be moved by this film. Gore also ties in some emotional pull into the film which draws the viewer in more, the stories it tells of Al Gore all help further explain why he is so passionate about global warming and how his fate has been chosen to spread this knowledge worldwide, city by city, family by family in hopes to change enough minds one day so we humans can make a change and save our planet.</fullReview>

Even actuaries, discussing the insurance risks of continued overbreeding, meat-eating &amp; refusal to get off fossil fuels, or generals in the army and navy, would have made better presenters than Gore.The USA needs true leftwing radicals running it, who advocate going to war against fascist Arab countries like Saudi Arabia and against the fossil fuel industry, defending &amp; building up the solar and wind industry.

		<fullReview>The statistics in this movie were well researched. There is no doubt about it! Al Gore certainly presents his case very well and it is no wonder that this movie got the praise that it got. Al Gore is certainly quite an actor. He sounds so concerned. But actions speak louder than words! Throughout this movie, there are political tidbits and references to his political career sprinkled throughout the movie.Jimmy Carter, unlike Al Gore, is a man of integrity who not only talks the talk, but walks the walk as well. When Carter thought we needed to conserve energy, he turned down the thermostat in the White House and got warm by wearing a sweater.Al Gore tells us that we have to conserve energy and claims that we are creating global warming while he travels around in his own private jet. How much energy does his jet use and how much more pollution does his jet create? How much energy does it take to heat Gore's swimming pool behind his mansion? It would be nice if we could conserve electricity by using smaller appliances and making it a point to turn off anything that is not being used. But if we did, the power company would react to a 50% reduction of energy by calling it a "50% loss in revenue" and recouping their losses by raising the rates by 50%. So "just turning it off" would not be a very good idea.This movie is a veiled appeal to allow Big Goivernment to take control of everything, in the name of saving planet earth, that is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>At the time this movie was made, I suppose cynics could have suggested that it was a propaganda piece to boost Al Gore's chances of winning the presidency in 2008 by linking him to an issue that was growing in popularity. The cynics would be wrong, of course. Gore didn't run for president in 2008 even though he would have been a pretty serious contender. Conclusion? Maybe he really believes in this! Basically, I thought Gore put together a pretty effective documentary on the whole issue of global warming. He seemed to have a pretty good grasp of the facts and the science (although I admit that I am no expert on global warming, nor am I a scientist.) He also showed a surprisingly witty sense of humour that wasn't often on display during his years as Vice President that made this seem a little bit like the good lectures in university offered by a popular professor. Most effective, I thought, was that he didn't avoid or ridicule contrary points of view (as, say, someone like Michael Moore does) but rather he acknowledged them and then quite effectively confronted them. There was also a good use of graphs and pictures throughout, and useful suggestions for how individuals can make a contribution to fighting global warming. It's true that there were a few occasions when politics intruded. I think, for example of an extended scene (well, actually I guess it lasted two or three minutes) that dealt with the results of the disputed 2000 election that eventually made George Bush president. I thought that was unnecessary and out of place.Overall, though, I was impressed by Gore's way of presenting the case for confronting global warming. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Completely inaccurate</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie (I refuse to call it a documentary because that implies that it has accuracy) is completely exaggerated and inaccurate. Al Gore was a government major in college and knows absolutely nothing about science. There are countless things in this that are exaggerated and nonfactual but the biggest one is the cornerstone of this "prophet's" cult religion. That is that carbon dioxide causes global warming. Fact is the increase in temperature from solar activity causes release of carbon dioxide from the ocean, not that carbon dioxide causes the temperature to rise. The research that Al Gore himself is referencing in the movie blatantly states this; read it for yourself. Fact is, Al Gore knows that no one will read it and they will just blindly believe him. Anyone that says otherwise will inevitably be branded as evil, doesn't matter what the truth is. The actual scientific data that is legitimate shows that global warming is happening but is not in anyway whatsoever caused by human beings. Global warming and cooling (which was the last big scare over 40 years ago) is a natural occurrence. Whether we are causing it or not, how delusional is anyone that thinks we could possibly do anything about it. It's movies like Armageddon that make people think that people somehow can prevent their own extinction or control the sun or the earth. Al Gore uses this to gain political power, money, fame, and perpetuate the myth that capitalism is somehow the enemy. Believe me, he has an agenda. The most inconvenient truth of all is that Al Gore has become rich because of this. If you don't want to read or don't know how to find the real research (it is hard to find because of political motives), you can watch the great global warming swindle (http://youtu.be/tJ- 1iL9g8nU). It was pretty good and has actual reputable people making logical and legitimate points. Still, I have no doubt that some people who have their head so far up their @$$ and have no sense of logical deduction or reason will say that it is BS.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While I feel unconvinced that Al Gore's intentions with this documentary were entirely selfless and that it is quite possible that this film was partly made to make him more popular, this film convinced me sufficiently of global warming to take action and to genuinely care. The first scene of the film is an absolute wonder- so simple, yet so brilliant- I wouldn't want to ruin it for you in case you haven't seen it. This film is essentially just an opportunity for Al Gore to give you his presentation on global warming that he has apparently given over 1000 times and he presents his case clearly and well with good humour. The thing about the film that frustrates me is undoubtedly it's focus on Al Gore, I really don't feel I need to know all that much about his upbringing and childhood to find out whether there is a connection between the rise of CO2 concentration in the Atlantic and the temperatures at the poles. I realize that several of Gore's predictions on global warming have been patently false and that recently, the north pole's ice cap actually grew rather than shrank as he predicted. But at the end of the day I really can't be bothered analyzing all the facts and coming to my own conclusion so it's easier if I just act as if it was true that humans are causing Global Warming since I don't believe it's worth running the risk of being to skeptical since this really isn't the kind of mistake that the human race can afford to make. 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An Inconvenient Truth (2006): Dir: Davis Guggenhein / Featuring: Al Gore, George Bush, George W. Bush, Ronald Reagan: An alarming documentary about global warming that has its moments of clarity as well as its moments that seem forced and more message driven than allowing for any hint of entertainment value. It contains no colourful characters of broad interest like in a Michael Moore documentary and it isn't anywhere near as entertaining. Al Gore uses his celebrity power to create awareness with regards to global warming. He instructs a classroom of students as well as address the camera with charts that travel back to early 1900's and the gradual downfall the earth has taken. Director Davis Guggenheim achieves the shock intended but more importantly is Al Gore's encouragement claiming that the problem has a solution but it needs addressed by a wider population. With that said, the film contains negative energy. It is obvious that global warming is an important issue that needs to be addressed and dealt with but viewers are practically beat over the head with almost hopeless solutions. The film is well made and it drives its message home but viewers should be encouraged to better the planet not shamed for the problem arising to begin with. In the end this film contains a lot of truth while narrowly avoiding becoming one big inconvenience all its own. Score: 6 ? / 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the powerpoint presentation that made Al Gore famous again. But that is what it is: a powerpoint presentation. Nothing more. It does not deserve an Oscar or a Nobel peace price.The main idea behind this "An Inconvenient Truth" is that Global Warming exist, and that it is man-made. Though i think it is OK that Al Gore made this powerpoint presentation, then it is very wrong of him as to claim that it is a scientific fact that Global Warming exist - because it just isn't.The main pretext for the theory of Global Warming to be true, is that the climate of earth has always been stable, until modern man destroyed the climate with big factories and CO2-emissions. All agree on that.But the thing is that the Earth climate has never ever been stable. A couple of thousands of years ago the earth was engulfed in an ice age. Before that Ice Age, the earth experienced a hot age - a time when the temperature was way higher than today. This is all scientific fact - go read about it in you local library. Before that "hot age", the earth experienced another ice age. Before that Ice age, the earth experienced yet another hot age, and before that yet yet another ice age.The pro-global-warming Al-gore fan would then postulate that man-made CO2 was responsible for those ice ages and warm ages. But that just isn't true. Modern Man with all the factories and cars didn't exist back then, and yet Global Warming happened. How does that fit with the Prophet Al Gores theories of that all Global Warming is caused by man? Fact is that the Climate of Earth have been changing from hot temperature to cold temperature all the ages in which earth has existed. The Earth have experienced much warmer weather in the past, when the amount of CO2 was way lower than it is today (research this, it is true). All these amounts of evidence against man made global warming just shows that man made CO2 does not have a significant impact on the climate of earth.Global Warming happens, but it is not the result of man made CO2. Other factors play in to this scenario as well. Most notable must be the sun and cosmic rays. Do we humans really think that our climate is unaffected by the immense powers of the universe? Hell no! Try to read about this theory. One notable scientist, whose work on this you should read, is Henrik Svensmark. Read some papers by Henrik Svensmark, and you'll find that Global Warming happens, but it is not caused by Carbon-dioxide (CO2), but the cosmos.</fullReview>

This kind of movies just makes me remember the guys that ear money by doing conferences all around the world about how to get rich, how to success, business relationships into markets never eared... and so on..</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Does Not Give Enough Answers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"An Inconvenient Truth" gives a much needed message on the dangers of global warming but it does not spend enough time telling us what we can do to make things better. Instead it is 90 minutes of Al Gore talking at us about how dangerous global warming is.I got the message in the first 30 minutes. The next 60 minutes just seemed like repetition. It isn't until the ending credits does it tell you what you can do as an individual to help make things better. Even then it is real small things like buying compact florescent bulbs and setting the thermostat lower. In this regard, I consider "An Inconvenient Truth" a failure.If you really want to make a difference for the environment, read "The World Peace Diet" by Will Tuttle and "The Food Revolution" by John Robbins. Both books show that the amount of resources to make 1 pound of animal protein versus 1 pound of vegetable protein is causing a lot more damage to our environment than the factories and the cars. In other words, eating less meat, dairy and eggs does more for the environment than driving a Prius.I admire the message that "An Inconvenient Truth" was giving, I just wish it had done more as far as presenting a solution.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Inconvenient Truth was the breakout documentary du jour for 2006.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An Inconvenient Truth is utterly convincing, it's emotionally powerful and it makes Al Gore look more charming than he ever did as a presidential candidate. The former US vice-president tours the world, giving lecture to heighten awareness of global warming.There may be nothing new here for those who study environmental matters closely. And cinematically, it's little more than a filmed slide-show. Yet Gore is remarkably persuasive, addressing the public over the heads of other politicians seemingly intent to avoiding engagement with this most pressing of issues. Since the film's release, An Inconvenient Truth has been credited for raising international public awareness of climate change and reenergizing the environmental movement.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An inconvenient truth, it's time to change!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An inconvenient truth is not a question of numbers, images or statistics, it's a matter of attitude!The goal of Al Gore is alert the most people to the problem that is global warming. I think this documentary can do it in different ways for different audiences using a good communication strategy based on practical examples.Alert to issues such as technological developments (now much discussed) that is beneficial but has consequences, although are our mistakes that lead to more serious consequences. I think the approach of the political issue was important. Economy vs. Environment. We have to think that now our priority is to save the planet. There is no point in thinking in profit first and then "whom comes in the end that close the door." It is a question of intelligence. There are situations where we have to move backwards to obtain benefits later. I've been reading considerations that this documentary and the books associated are alarmist. I don't agree, because the data shows that whenever we think that things will not be so bad, or when we make an estimate future they always end up being even worse. The aim is to change habits and ideas and accept that this problem is real. How could we get that if we didn't show the dark side of things? And even then, isn't that side truthful, isn't real? How can we get a reaction without shocking?What I think that it's vital in this documentary, despite everything I have seen and read about it, is that the warming is global, and as the name suggests, it is a responsibility of all of us, and therefore we must work together to beat it, we must think in "the future as a civilization". I think that all the communication around the global warming, with more or less impact, better or worse, with or without Al Gore, has a common goal: to do something to live in a better planet.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An inconvenient truth has doubtless had a profound influence on the general publics' want for action on the case of global warming; however I do not feel Al Gore, in the documentary, has provided adequate evidence with which to back his claims. In many cases, he cites his evidence as coming from "a friend of mine" failing to clarify who this "friend" is, and whether or not he may have a biased opinion on the matter. I'm not saying that global warming is not occurring, but "An Inconvenient Truth" defiantly seems more subjective than objective. Few counter arguments are explored, and if they are even mentioned, they are usually brief and biased. The use of hyperbolae is quite incredible since, human nature being what it is, people tend to voice the worst, and this is indeed the case with Al Gore.The underlying fact is, if one portrays a message in a seemingly selfless, objective manner, people will tend to accept it without question.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Al gore - does that name ring a bell? Probably it reminds you about Bush, as the world witnessed intense battle between these two candidates for the world's most powerful post! Yes, the fortunate or the unfortunate runner up in the 2000 US Presidential elections that saw the tyranny called Bush take over the reigns at White House and the bloody gore the world has had to suffer as its aftermath. Inconvenient truth is about Al Gore or is it? Here he leaves behind the scars of not becoming the commander of Air force one and wears the cap of an environmental activist. From Iraq bombings he switches track to Global warming. In this 2006 Oscar winning documentary, the former deputy of Bill Clinton issues a Global warning about the impending quagmire that the world will force itself into if the Climate issue is not addressed.The documentary shot in the form of a presentation that The 2007 Nobel Peace Prize winner makes to a select American audience is a blend of subtle expression and startling statistics that eases the audience gradually into the core subject matter. With visual aids adorning the otherwise dark backdrop, Al Gore painstakingly pitches in for the need to realize the gravity of the situation.He leaves no stone unturned in his quest, as he forks in data from the days of his graduation to the recent samples that indicate a total unanimity among the scientific group about the existence and the concomitant ramifications of Global warming. Traveling from the North Pole to the South Pole, from Greenland to Antarctica, covering a host of areas around the globe from the US to Europe to China to India, the documentary is a testimony to the efforts that Al gore has committed to the cause of making people aware of Global Warming.The documentary lends a personal touch to itself as Gore disembarks from the world at large to experiences in his own life, about how his father gave up tobacco farming after the death of his elder sister, the difficult times he had to face as his son was tethered in the hospital bed and displayed great courage in the face of death. He owes it to his professor at the college for throwing light about Global warming in formative days.At times he stokes with sarcasm and satire about the American way of political thinking, the audacity of American commercial establishments to disrespect human life with utter impudence, about how the United States acts as the biggest polluter and contributor of Global warming to the tune of 30%. The photography in 'An inconvenient truth' is mesmerizing to say the least, it has enough awe to make the desired impact and leave a lasting impression about the perils of not taking any steps to purge the evils that shroud the earth. From the picture of the Blue rise taken from the Apollo mission, to the Muslims formed by molten water gushing through the crevices in ice capped land masses, there is a touch of class about it.'An inconvenient Truth' may not be a bone chilling experience but it leaves your feet cold. It may not be a numbing experience but it has you thinking. It is a sincere attempt sans any glamor or grudge that everyone has to watch as responsible citizens of this world to get a glimpse of the current situation and develop an understanding of the need to look at the future with a certain perspective.The documentary is a stunning glory for the Gore team in authentically brining out the gory consequences we have to face if we do not act quickly on the burning issue of 'Global warming'.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A good and accessible documentary. Al Gore comes across as a talented communicator. The numbers speak for them self, the documentation is, as far as I can tell, solid. My only beef is those occasional breaks from the lecture, in which he shows some sentimental scenes in which he tries to be profound. Flowing rivers, beautiful countryside and a family photo with an injured six year old who survived an accident. It feels tacky to me, but oh well - some (women) will probably appreciate his sensitive and soft qualities. Anyway, not my cup of tea in an otherwise very respectable presentation.If you can stand a few sentimental lines coupled with idyllic landscapes, you should see An Inconvenient Truth, because it makes global warming an approachable subject for mortal beings.</fullReview>

The highlights of the disasters of hurricanes show how the world is getting destroyed. Along with footage of warm temperatures that prove the earth is simply over heated. The message is thrown our way too to use less carbon like stay away from riding our cars and instead walk to work or ride a bike. No matter what political side or your stance you take on this issue overall this is an okay doc that's more educational than entertaining even though it probably won't launch a movie career for Al Gore.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw a documentary not too long ago titled: "Who Killed the Electric Car". "An Inconvenient Truth" seems like a natural spin off. They both address carbon dioxide emissions and its damage to the environment. Whereas they were both interesting and informative I liked "Who Killed the Electric Car" more because of the variety.Al Gore's documentary was a lecture style presentation of facts regarding global warming. I have nothing against Al Gore, but less of Gore would have been better. I like documentaries that have different people giving different perspectives on the same thing. This documentary had only Gore speaking and at some times it was more like a Gore autobiography. That may be of interest to some but probably not to most. Plus, with Gore being the main mouthpiece, people not partial to his politics will automatically tune him out.I like the information of the documentary, as I think it is of the utmost importance. I only wish there were more scientists and other intellectuals to chime in and give their take. I also would have liked to hear more in-depth talks about the solutions to the problem. One thing I've found out by just being alive and being around human beings is that people can always tell you what the problem is, but few are the people who have solutions, and even fewer are those who offer detailed solutions.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worst propaganda film of the 21th Century?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is a total disgrace. The lead character, former vice-president Al Gore, travels around showing people his bogus PowerPoint presentation on luxury high definition projectors and presenting lies and half truths to scare people to stop emitting CO2, leave their hard earned money to him, and renounce the environmentalist's latest Satan, the CO2 molecule.Here you will witness a man with no scientific training whatsoever, but with plenty of shroud political and rhetorical talent, feeding on insecure people's fears, and trying to start a new global religion, where emitting CCO2 will send you to hell and science itself becomes a disposable victim of collateral damage. Who is the new God then? Maybe it's Gore himself. The scene with him using a lever to rise himself up to face the curve with the falsely correlating CO2 and temperature will be the a joke on TV and online video sites for the coming 100 years, as the globe cools and the CO2 jamboree splits and shreds into the core of fanatical anti- science, global governance gang it once emerged from.There is given NO evidence whatsoever for CO2 driving temperature in this film. Then again, how could anyone present evidence that is not there?There are lots of examples of climate catastrophe and famine, none of which can be attributed to CO2. Gore falsely claims polar bears are drowning, whereas they are some of the best swimmers amongst land-dwelling mammals. We now have more polar bears on the planet than in the 1960s. He claims sea level is rising, but that's been a truth since the last ice-age, 15 mm per decade for at least 8000 years. He claims there are now more storms and hurricanes than ever, but the global warming theory tells us to expect less storms and hurricanes as the temperature difference between the poles and the equator gets smaller, and so on. For every false claim that CO2 causes temperature change and that global warming causes this and that, the film deteriorates more and more into a religious farce with no connection at all to well-known known scientific theory, in field after field.He also tells us about his 5th grade friend, a pupil that discover that South America and Africa could be fitted together, and the teacher telling him, that no, there is no such connection. This story, like much of the rest of what Gore comes up with in this so-called documentary is a fairy-tale. It was not Gore's classmate that discovered this, it was Alfred Wegener, who about 80 years after his death, rightly was accredited for his theory of Continental drift and the super-continent Pangea.But anyway, get a copy of this movie. It will be rising in value over the years to come. People 20-30 years from now will have something to laugh at, when they find out that this film received two Oscars, one of these for 'Best Documentary', and the fact that the CO2 theory led to Al Gore and the UNs IPCC won the Nobel peace price on lies and utter propaganda by the disruption of well-known science and the scientific method.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although you could quibble over some of the statistics and scenarios presented in this film, at the end of the day, the need to address the reality of global warming is almost certainly essential.This film could also be entitled 'The world according to Al Gore'. It is essentially his take on the environment and global warming-including a bit of home-grown farm-boy Americanism thrown in. (A short note of irony-in the film he discusses growing and sellling tobacco on the family farm-something his family stopped doing when his chain-smoking sister died of lung cancer. But like the envrionmental debate-did his general family success rest partially on some of the very things he now advocates others not do?).However, some of the stats presented may be a little out of context or exaggerated, (as various environmentalists try and outdo each other to present the worst possible scenario-and in so doing advance their own mantra and/or careers), but that doesn't stop the fact that a warmer earth poses some serious issues.The world is steadily getting warmer, the question is what does this mean for all of humanity, and what can we do about it? I must admit I am one those optimists who think that eventually some big (and probably expensive) long-term solution will present itself, (such as large-scale carbon dioxide extraction from the atmosphere) and all the doom and gloom will wither away-but I could be wrong.This film argues the case that the effects of global warming will continue, and indeed steadily get worse. But the film, at least for me, doesn't really offer much in terms of long-term solutions. The issue of global warming is problematical, not because of its undeniable reality, but rather, because just how does one go about addressing it? My only suggestion is that various long-term and innovative solutions could be addressed in a sequel, as there isn't many provided in this film. (Turning off that extra lightbulb at night isn't going to do very much. And telling developing nations not to use fossil fuels when the west has been doing so for much longer and in much greater volumes isn't going to help struggling economies).Alternative opinions/scenarios have been simplified in this film, (which is a common theme in these sort of political issues), but overall, well presented, and one might also ponder what might have been if a few hundred more voters in Florida in 2000 had voted for Al Gore instead of George Bush. I think I preferred his farm-boy approach to Mr Bush's retardate mumblins.But Bush has been here several times since the former Mayor was his college roommate (and he was given the post as Ambassador to Poland! -- that's politics) and not once did I have any desire to see him. To me, he is a villain as he took that election from Gore (the person who had the most votes!) and has consistently made this country into second class. But, back to "Native Son" Al Gore, TVA is situated in Tennessee and has built several nuclear plants with those polluting smoke stacks. Not far from here, in Kingston, you can see one of the first with more than three tall smoke stacks polluting the air.When Oak Ridge was developed, we in Knoxville were kept ignorant of the bomb making and all of that excess pollution was blown on the winds into this valley to cause many locals to die from cancer. If he is concerned with global pollution to the environment, he should look on his own doorstep. (Actually, he does not live in Tennessee.) He had bragged that he invented computers! Since his devastating loss in Florida, where Bush's brother is Governor, he has been on the board of Apple computers; now he is a senior adviser to Google, the most corrupt agency on computers. He has developed Current TV and Generation Investment Management based in Hamburg (why?) and David Blood is one of the founding partners. Could this movie be a hit? No way! He secured the funding from such celebrities as Laurie David and Jeffrey Coombs.If he wants to point fingers, all he needs to do is first look at his chosen home state. Actually he grew up in Washington, DC and went to school up North. There's not much Southern about Gore. He doesn't even have our courtesy. He came to UT to speak on this very issue using large screen with some of this film to validate his expertise on the subject. At some places, he demands between $150,000 to $250,000 to give a lecture. Imagine. Grim, ungainly, rude Al Gore being paid to appear important.Perhaps, his lecture at a Tennessee university was one of his freebies, but on the t.v. news he was abrupt and refused to answer questions for the public at home. I'm glad I didn't make the effort to go the short distance to see this garbage.</fullReview>

Then, he starts going on about how his father farmed, and a bull in a field along with a bunch of other irrelevant nonsense.

		<shortDescription>Mediocre at best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me state, up front, I have never been a fan of former Vice President Al Gore. He was a right of center Democrat who worked in an administration whose environmental record was considered, by most ecological groups, worse than the two Republican administrations that preceded his, and held that office at a time when the earliest stages of global warming, which he now decries, were first becoming known. As the second most visible politician in the country, did he sound the alarums then? Well, no. He wrote a book or two, but did nothing of any real consequence with the power he had. However, his Johnny Come lately status as an environmentalist, which led to his winning of the Nobel Peace Prize, as well as an Oscar for the 94 minute 2006 documentary, An Inconvenient Truth, has nothing to do why it's a bad film. That's due solely to the film's director Davis Guggenheim, most noted as a network television director?. The film is basically two thirds of Gore preaching to the public about global warming by giving a slide show with some neat graphics. Again, the vast majority of what he states is incontrovertible, and the few areas where he exaggerates are minor disagreements between the scientific community where he chooses the worst scenario for dramatic effect. This is forgivable on Gore's part, and even the filmmaker's. It is also quite effective. But, where the film tanks, and also goes way beyond any reasonable standard for calling itself a documentary, is in the interspersed other third of the film, where we get the fetishistic close-ups of Gore as saint aborning, and in the hamhanded voiceovers. Putting aside the fact that the writing of the voiceovers is cringe-inducing (see above), Guggenheim could have at least put on a patina of objectivity by having the voiceovers done by someone else- perhaps another Left Winger like Tim Robbins. Instead, we are left with the unseemly deification of Al Gore?.by Al Gore!Even worse we get a parade of Oprah Winfrey-level sob stories about how tough a life Al Gore has- being born with a silver spoon, political power, and the disappointment of being out-scioned by George W. Bush for the Presidency. There are some genuine bad things that the film inexplicably digresses to, such as his sister's death from lung cancer and his son's near-fatal car crash. So? I mean, what is the point of the film- to act as a documentary about the global warming crisis, or about Al Gore's 'indomitable courage'? Such courage which propels him to 'walk alone' in airports- as if he's just a 'regular person.' Or to spend hours on his laptop computer monkeying with graphs. Ooh, he's deep. Yup. Yes he is. Yessirreebob! But, if Guggenheim could only stop with the up the nostrils viewpoint so many of his shots have. I mean, even if Al Gore is the greatest man in the history of our species, do we really need to be able to count his nose hairs??.Overall, An Inconvenient Truth has important ideas, but is a bad film precisely because those ideas are made secondary to the ego of Al Gore. That is not Gore's fault, but Guggenheim's, yet is precisely why An Inconvenient Truth is a bad film, and not even remotely a 'documentary.'</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very timely and a Must see but overpopulation is the inevitable killer</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Al gore makes an important documentary that has successfully focused more attention on the theories that climate change and global warming are due mainly to man.Where the documentary fails is that it fails to put enough emphasis on other factors effecting the earths ecology such as overpopulation.There are many documentaries now being produced that counter the theories in Gore's film and he should have taken more care to take into account the opposition to make a more balanced view at what are still theories in many people's minds.I personally believe that Al Gore's message is right but the inevitable march of human overpopulation makes the solution impossible and therefore we are all doomed.I recommend the film but please recycle your anti-depressant pill packaging thoughtfully.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The presentation by Al Gore is extremely effective as it slams home the hard facts that 1) CO2 emission is causing a devastating effect on the environment, which is almost universally accepted as uncontroversial; and 2) everyone has a personal responsibility, which borders on becoming a duty, to reduce CO2 emission.Al Gore has masterfully communicated those two facts in a simple way and this film is a majestic example of how speeches should be given. Prior to watching this movie I, as a lay person, know global warming is a huge problem but never thought the Earth is already showing so much of the horrible and devastating 'symptoms'. Every smoker knows their health is seriously jeopardised, but a famous rebuke is "look at Mr. Smith who smokes everyday since 18 and now he is still alright at 85". The smoker will still not be convinced if he is told by a doctor that Mr. Smith has cancer, because it is a medical condition and we tend to think only doctors can diagnose those complicated symptoms. Afterall Mr. Smith is still alive! The smoker is less likely to argue if he sees that Mr. Smith cannot stop coughing, is spitting out blood every minute and looks sick.The movie is convincing precisely as it does not attempt to convince us that the Earth has caught 'cancer' by means of technical diagnoses. Instead, it shows you various symptoms: rising temperature every year; disappearing glaziers, forests, rivers; polar bears drowning; natural disasters happening much more frequently. We can all judge for ourselves by looking at the pictures and we do not need a PhD to see that. If anyone could explain all those devastating images other than by global warming and CO2 emission, it would be most welcome (and to my relief) but I doubt anyone could dismiss global warming as a MAJOR (if not the only) reason.The only flaw is, as pointed out by others, that certain of his personal experiences slipped into the movie which have no direct bearings on the impact of the message he delivered so well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"What gets us into trouble is not what we don't know. It's what we know for sure that just ain't so." - Mark Twain.This is the quote with which Al Gore starts his presentation on Global warming, in his documentary, "An Inconvenient Truth". This documentary has completely shattered my beliefs about global warming, its cause and its effects. It is now that I realize how big this problem is and that our planet is in grave danger. What shocked me the most is realizing the fact that hardly any measures has been taken to curb this problem in fact measures have been taken to silence this issue.Al Gore presents scientific evidence to prove the connection between Carbon emissions and global warming. He is brilliant in his presentation and uses a very simple language to describe the issue. "An Inconvenient Truth" is an Oscar winning documentary. It reveals many present effects of global warming like Glacier melting, Storms, floods, alteration of oceanic currents, drowning of polar bears, spreading of diseases and many more effects.Trusly one of the best documentaries ever made. I rate it 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Inconvenient Truth is a long-awaited documentary about global warming and the effect it has on the humankind. It is filled with interesting (and shocking) findings about the global warming that is getting worse everyday. This documentary proves to the non-believer (whether it's because they choose not to believe or they try to tell themselves that this is movie is just a hype) that Mother Earth is ailing unless we do something about it.When watching this documentary, please remind yourself that it doesn't matter who give the lecture. What's important is what he/she is trying to tell us. It's what he/she talks about that matters. It is important that we have an open mind. Let us refuse to listen just because he/she comes from a political party that you do not support.Now back to the documentary. Many proves are put forward to convince the audiences that global warming is for real, and that we'll soon be heading into a catastrophe unless the humankind to something to stop it. As of now, the Co2 emission to the atmosphere is at a worrying state, and that it is the highest ever recorded by scientists.Something has to be done. At the end of the documentary is a lists of what we could do to to help Mother Earth. Remember, small bits count a lot when many people pitch in.</fullReview>

Al gore proves himself, after endless years of research he s been through his life solely to "ENLIGHTEN" people on the ways and cruelty of man towards mother nature that we are surely not helping anyone by the way we are progressing. I really had a thought that this documentary presented by Al gore would be more of a "POLITICAL ISSUE" , he has proved that there is nothing political about global warming. " AN INCONVENIENT TRUTH " also does not have the sole goal of winning Oscars. The purpose would be fulfilled only if we realize that world is such a beautiful place we live in .

		<shortDescription>Confronting Global Warming Today</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There has been a sudden surge in recent years in the number of documentary films that have managed to make it successfully to audiences in the movie theaters--THE FOG OF WAR; BOWLING FOR COLUMBINE; FAHRENHEIT 9/11, and so on. Put AN INCONVENIENT TRUTH into that same illustrious category--especially since it talks about a threat to this planet far more insidious than even terrorism, though one that is still caused by human beings--Global Warming.Noted television director Davis Guggenheim teamed up with former Vice President Al Gore, a tireless advocate for environmental causes, to make this film, and to make it a warning to us that human activity and the allowing of extreme levels of carbon dioxide and other so-called "greenhouse gases" are things that are causing extreme shifts in climates throughout the world: lengthy droughts in Central Africa; the disappearance of glaciers in the highest mountains of the world; chunks of Antarctica breaking off; and the explosion of Hurricane Katrina into a monster super storm that nearly destroyed New Orleans. While it all may seem didactic, the evidence presented in AN INCONVENIENT TRUTH is extremely compelling at the very least, and quite indisputable. Gore himself has seen first-hand the effects of human carelessness, and so he knows whereof he speaks when he talks about climate changes bought by this insidious thing that environmentalists have been worried about since the political and social turbulence of the 1960s bought about changing attitudes about the world we live in.What is particularly compelling is the data that shows how many American cities, especially in the West, experienced temperatures during the summer that were well above normal, often breaking records, and how these extreme temperatures, alternating with severe fires and severe floods, are caused by pollution. As Gore says near the end, however, the technology to combat global warming is already in our hands, and it requires only the will to make it take place. Of course, there are cynics on the far-right of the political spectrum who, not content with having derided Gore while he was in public office, will deride him as a "tree hugger" now and call global warming "the biggest hoax ever perpetrated." But the evidence is so mind-numbingly clear, the answers so obvious, and the means so readily available that, as AN INCONVENIENT TRUTH points out, it would be the worst kind of folly not to put any of these things into action today, rather than wait fifty or a hundred years when the problem may be irreversible. The time to combat global warming is now, and AN INCONVENIENT TRUTH makes its point about as well as any documentary has done in recent times.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First it was my world history class. Then I saw it in my economics class. And my socicial studies class. And my home economics class. In total, I, a Northern Lankanshire high schooler, say I have had the film An Inconvenient Truth shown to me by four different teachers this year."I really don't understand why they keep showing it," says I (my parents asked that my last name not be used). "I've spoken to the principal about it, and he said that teachers are instructed to present it as a debate. But every time we've seen it, well, one teacher said this is basically a two-sided debate, but this movie really gives you the best idea of what's going on." I educated myself enough about both sides of the climate- change controversy to know that the Al Gore movie is too one-sided to be taught as fact. Even scientists who back Mr. Gore's message admit they're uncomfortable with liberties the politician takes with "science" in the "film". But, I maintain most of my classmates are credulous. His teachers are not much more discerning. "They don't know there's another side to the argument," I says. My mother was outraged to find out that Mr. Gore's film was being presented as fact in my classroom. "This is just being poured into kids' brains instead of letting them know there's a debate going on," she says. "An educational system falls down when they start taking one side." It's time to face reality. We have been overrun by traitors. The only option is war- with faith in God. Either that or lay down. Which I do not. Nor do my people. You Christians have every right to defend yourselves against tyranny. Do so. God is with you. I am with you. Only fear and apathy can take the republic from you.</fullReview>

Al Gore tries to make this issue sound complicated, even though it just needs common sense to see this whole thing is a big hoax by a man with his own moneymaking agenda!How have scientists estimated historical temperatures of this planet? By estimating the sun spot activity. Has nobody ever questioned if this method has been accurate? No, not even Gore himself! So how the heck would it not be accurate to forecast future temperature with sun spot activity if it has been that accurate in the past? According to sun spot activity the temperature today is totally in line with what it should be. How come the temperature in the entire universe has risen (relatively) equal much as on earth? Does our SUVs cause temperature on Jupiter to rise?Use some common sense! You do not need to be a rocket scientist to figure out that this can be nothing else than a HOAX. Please research it yourself. What does Al Gore and his elitist friends like Rothschild (banking family that arranged live earth event) to gain from this? Well, the new world bank will be founded on carbon credits, that is tax on everything that gives CO2 omissions, and it is easier to get away with these taxes if the people are lured to think it is to save the world when it is only about money, centralized control and more power to the elitist bankers. Al Gore has even a company that sells carbon credits! Is it not noble to pay voluntarily carbon credits to save the world, especially if it goes into his own company? I do not want you to blindly believe me, please do your own research and use your own common sense and I am sure you will come to the right conclusion!</fullReview>

My friend is not a scientist but he claims that there are scientists who refute what Mr. Gore says. After watching the movie all I can say is Al Gore is right - the naysayers are those who first of all haven't seen the movie or read the U.N. report - they get their talking points from Tom Delay and/or the oil company lobbyists. The movie itself is not one of those deadly dull documentaries - it is entertaining because Al Gore is one outstanding presenter - he obviously is passionate about this subject and that comes across loud and clear. His story is easily understandable and free of jargon. This movie will make you think if you take the time to watch it. It may even make you want to take action. Mr. Gore is not by any stretch making himself the center of attention - he makes our planet the main attraction and so far we have not been very good stewards. What is sad is that the remedies Gore recommends will help the planet even if the claims are somehow exaggerated. Go see this movie. You will be surprised.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wish IMDb had negative ratings because I would give this -10 stars. It is clear that Gore suffers from a Napoleon Complex after coming up short in the 2000 election. However, the bruising defeat has not tempered the former next president's aspirations to be remembered as a Gandhi, baldly apparent when he vied for the title "creator of the internet" and now as some global climate savior.Other viewers have rightly observed that this is Chicken Little revisited and therein lies the rub. No one likes a Chicken Little, at least not in America. We're a bunch of optimists and can't be held back. Even if Chicken Little is right, we still feel rubbed. So if Gore thinks he will be canonized for his efforts, he is wrong, not withstanding his Oscar.Americans hate losers and hate losing. And let's face it, Gore is a loser. An also-ran. Eventually he, his film, and his Chicken Little crusade will fade from memory much the same way Our Gang and the Little Rascals have faded from public consciousness.</fullReview>

What scared me the most about the movie was not the global warming side of things, but the fact that he opened up the movie with "I'm Al Gore, I used to be the next president of the United States" - right away, I knew it was politically-oriented. Global warming cannot be summed up in one film by a boring politician who knows nothing about scientific facts. The purpose of this film (which I would not call a documentary) is to scare the public into believing something that may or may not be true. A documentary has to provide facts, while most people are just following the leader and believing Al Gore word-for-word.The main issue here is that Al Gore is a huge hypocrite, and doesn't even bother practicing what he preaches.Show me a real documentary with real facts and scientists, and I may give it another shot.

		<fullReview>Unfortunately I don't think that Al Gore is going to be able to achieve what he so desperately wants to, which is to change the minds of people the world over one person at a time. The reason being that this has become such a polarizing issue that no matter how well presented the facts are and no matter who is presenting them you're mind is not going to be swayed if you already have it made. I must say however that this is an excellent presentation of the known facts on global warming so far. It boils the major scientific points down to easily understandable facts and displays the information in a hard to refute manner, if a bit too simplified. But unfortunately I must say that Al Gore is not the right person to be presenting this. He's too polarizing a figure. Too political, and somewhat too self centred. That's not an argument to stay away from the film however as it's one of the better documentaries out there, sadly one of the only, on the issue of global warming and does a good job of hammering home just how dire an issue this really is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had heard some stuff about the subject matter of this documentary, so I was very keen to see what many people in this world are choosing to ignore. Global warming and climate change are crucial facts, and Al Gore - the man who could have been president instead of George W. Bush, here presents a multimedia slide show, one of his many he has done around the world. He wants to show people that if we do not make change in the world, we could end up damaging the Earth and life on it much more crucially than we could imagine. Significant dangers include flooding caused by ice cap melting, serious weather patterns (mostly tornadoes), fatal heat waves, all unavoidable stuff. The documentary also sees the life of Gore growing up, campaigning for these changes, and of course standing for President (twice). Filled with both serious facts, interesting media footage, mixed with a little humour, it is one of those documentaries you can't forget for a long while after watching. Hopefully it will make you think to make changes to your lifestyle, that is probably the idea. It won the Oscars for Best Documentary, Features and Best Song for "I Need To Wake Up".

		<shortDescription>persuasive and important, but still a very mediocre film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Look, I think it's great that Gore's movie gave a push to the environmental movement. Gore makes a very strong case, and while I'm still a bit skeptical, simply because I've been hearing we were a decade from environmental meltdown every year since I was a kid in the 60s, I think that the reason we haven't hit that meltdown is because there are always people like Gore out there pushing people to at least do enough to delay that meltdown. Gore has made global warming concerns trendy, and while that probably won't translate into more than five years of public awareness (remember how trendy saving the homeless was in the 80s? We must have solved that one, since you don't hear much about it anymore), in five years we may do a few things that will keep the planet going a while longer.But none of that makes An Inconvenient Truth a good movie. It appears that people review this film based on how they feel about the message rather than how this holds up as film making, but just looked at from that perspective, it's not at all good. Certainly it's not a movie that should have won an Oscar.First off, as everyone knows, it's just a power point presentation. It's a very nicely done power point presentation, but that's still what it is, and the movie just shows you a lecture with pictures. This is really the sort of thing that would be expected to turn up on PBS, but for some reason they managed to turn it into a theatrical film.But the film's biggest problem is the interludes about Gore used to pad it out. Gore talks in hushed tones about his family or the environment or the film does a quick overview of the theft of Gore's presidential win, all set to a moody, minimalist and decidedly uninteresting score. This not only adds nothing to the film, but actually subtracts from it. After suffering through the first few segments I simply fast forwarded through most of the rest.There is nothing wrong in adding something to Gore's bare bones presentation, but this was not the way to do it. While as a general rule I feel it's always good to remind people Bush stole the election, the fact is it doesn't really have anything to do with the future of the fight against global warming. And all the bits of Gore talking about this and that feel artificial and generally irrelevant. The film could have given us a cinema verite view of Gore's lecture circuit. It could have presented Gore's work outside lecturing in a less impressionistic way (you get glimpses into what he does, but not in a way that makes you actually know what's going on - you just know he's doing something). There could have been supporting scenes showing other presentations or scientific data, or just archival footage of earlier environmental battles. There is little you could have shown that wouldn't be more interesting than what was done.The only clever film making in the movie was the final credits, which neatly alternated between credits and advice on saving the planet. Outside of that, what cleverness the film delivers all comes from Gore's presentation rather than from the film maker.This is just a competent filming of an important lectured interspersed with utterly useless vignettes.I can't believe people are giving this 10 stars. I'm only giving this 5 stars for the sake of the message; I'm being too generous. And I feel sorry for the documentary film makers whose films got trounced by a piece of poor movie making.Still, worth watching for the information contained therein. Think of it as gold bars in a dirty gunny sack.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Al Gore makes a persuasive and well presented case but I remain sceptical about his claims. For example, the fact is that the global temperature of 2007 is statistically the same as 2006 as well as every year since 2001, while the CO2 has relentlessly risen from 370ppm to 380ppm, which contradicts some of Mr Gore's claims. This film should only be screened back-to-back with 'The Great Global Warning Swindle', which is even more thought-provoking about a subject which is still open to debate despite the hysterical claims of the converted. Afer all, to paraphrase Al Gore, if a man's salary depends on certain claims he is unlikely to search for data that destroys his livelihood. The Global Warming Industry has been the fastest growing since the Dot-Com boom - not only are scientists and researchers making a comfortable living presenting ever more hysterical forecasts of doom but manufacturers of everything from solar panels to light-bulbs are cashing in too. It would be interesting to learn how much Al Gore has made from his numerous lecture tours! Forty years from now, An Inconvenient Truth may make amusing viewing showing how people were hoodwinked in the beginning of the 21st century, similar to how they were threatened by forecasts of a new ice-age in the 1970's.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Al Gore's An Inconvenient Truth is a good start. I applaud him for his efforts in stopping Global Warming.His aim was to stop Global Warming, yes. But the movie should be more into HOW we can stop it, we all know that its happening. The facts he showed should NOT be taken as law. No one can say exactly what will happen to the Earth in the future, and as such those graphs are only predictions. (With too many variables where the change could be minuscule or major) &gt; It should've had more of how to stop it, less factsHe mentioned that we have stopped many phenomenas before, including the production of CFC's. CFC's are still an issue, yes the modern world has stopped using them, but developing countries still release them.Another thing that should've been shortened/taken out was the whole "Election 2000" bit. We know what happened, and this movie is about Environmental protection and Global Warming, not playing Politics. Anyway, how could the "Election 2000" bit be important if he's meant to be retired?With all those graphs showing how the whole world is destined for "doom", he never tells us what the exact measurements are (except for the years), and where the x axis for the graphs is positioned.He also says the USA and Australia should sign the Kyoto protocol. Firstly, Australia contributes very little compared to the rest of the world in terms of greenhouse gases, and secondly, our economy might not be able to support such a change.Overall its a good movie, but it definitely shouldn't be taken as truth or gospel. I gave it a 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Al Gore is "An Inconvenient Fraud"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Al Gore's supposed masterpiece should be stored under the heading of "masters of fiction." That's all this is, a work of pure unadulterated fiction and scare tactic. What is Al really doing here besides making another speech no one really wants to hear. This is a good companion piece to THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW, another work of fiction.What has really been done? Nothing. What has Al Gore really done? Make himself a boatload of money! That simple. The only reason this film was given a 7/10 rating was because it seemed humorous (Futurama scenes only).Al Gore still jets around everywhere, not thinking about his supposed impact of global warming, all the while condemning mankind for their "atrocities." He's nothing but a washed up joke. His time is over, his fifteen minutes of fame were up in 2001. Give up Al, it's over, you're a has-been.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why hate pollution!?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not really a fan of this movie... alright I hate it. Maybe I am the wrong sort of person to review it; see, I love pollution, I pollute things on purpose. But this movie, it has a lot to hate, regardless of me being Al Gore's antithesis. First off, it is biased. Al Gore seems to forget that pollution means products, pollution means jobs, money... take that away and what will happen to workers, their families? And factory owners, people tend to think of them as corrupt monsters in business suits and tailored skirts. In truth they are people trying to make a decent living, just like us. There will always be controversy on global warming; Al Gore insists it exists, and that pollution is the cause. But is it really? Maybe we don't know as much as we think we do, just because some beady-eyed little lab guys did some satellite aerial photographs and read some charts? If you are really a fan of all that environmental protection, earth saving garbage, watch something not to biased. Silkwood is a drama film based on a real story, is not biased. Nor is A Civil Action, the Insider or Davd Suzuki's TV documentaries, as pointless as they may be. Just don't forget, when you want to support any cause, no matter what, don't fall for the first thing you see, listen to both sides of the story. This film won't help you if that's what you're trying to do. The book of the film is the exact same, I saw it at the local library and a sticker had been taped to it, reading, "Warning, the information in this book and film is biased and unsuitable for research purposes." This much is true. Don't waste your time or cash for this movie, it isn't worth it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In 2004, the creators of the box-office hit Independence Day came out with another apocalyptic science-fiction film. Roland Emmerich's The Day After Tomorrow soon became one of the highest grossing films of all time. The crisis brought into account something that the entire world had been avoiding and hushing up for quite some time. Global warming, although indirectly, was finally being addressed to. Critics however did not much agree with the scientific accuracy of the film. Nonetheless, the destruction the film showed, opened eyes.In 2006, came out a documentary on global warming. The piece was written by former United States Vice President Al Gore. An Inconvenient Truth was not merely a film on global warming. Not only did it address the entire topic at point blank, it also did not make the use of computer generated graphics to show us the crisis we were facing. Finally, the issue that the world might indeed be on the verge of chaos, the fault being our very own, was coming out into the open.An Inconvenient Truth, apart from being an eye-opener by the time it ends, is also a film made with a lot of care. Just by looking at Al Gore throughout the entire screenplay, one notices the flawlessness with which he talks about the issues of rising CO2 levels and the state of the earth at the time of the last Ice Age. Even if The Day After Tomorrow was termed as scientifically inaccurate, it showed us things which, after seeing An Inconvenient Truth, one will realize were right. The known fact that students have learnt in school, about the temperature rising and the melting of the polar ice-caps resulting in a rise in sea-level, which eventually drowns low-lying areas, etc etc; is all true. All that and more. A particular sequence in the film shows us Al Gore commenting on satellite images of various low-lying areas of the world- The San Francisco Bay, the area around the rivers of Japan, the Bay of Bengal. Then comes the unexpected turn. The images that follow show us the state these places will be in in less than fifty years time given the continuation of dumping CO2 into the atmosphere at the present rate. The images are shocking, showing us the displacement of over 100million people all over the world. And that, speaking for itself, happens to be just the beginning.When they marketed the film with taglines like 'Nothing is scarier than the truth' and 'By far the most terrifying film you will ever see' they actually meant it. An Inconvenient Truth beats any blood and gore slasher film when it comes to chills. The photographs of places on earth taken now and decades ago will shock you beyond belief. The change the earth has gone through in the last fifty years is more than the change it went through in the previous thousand. That itself is fact enough to make anyone realize the need for change, and the time at which the chance to act is running out. A very noticeable factor about the film's narrative is that Al Gore explains the entire progress of global warming, its consequences, etc etc; almost in layman's terms. More often than not he uses cartoons to explain the situation and bring it to life. The technique not only adds as a comic relief, but it also acts as a more effective explanatory technique ending with the realization of something dire. Making the truth all the more difficult to handle. It is a contrast that he uses to full effect.An Inconvenient Truth also shares with us the life of Al Gore. One gets a very warm feeling listening to his story, right from the start. From where he lived, to how he grew up, and all for the purpose of showing us how much he wants us to care for his cause, how much he wants to see this world care about itself. It's very easily noticeable, how much effort the man himself has put into this project. The fact that the entire team have dedicated their heart and soul to this cause shows very clearly. This is not a film. This is a lesson. A lesson about the wrongs we have done to our planet, and the consequences we must face unless we rectify them. A lesson that everyone on the face of the earth should learn to see what Mother Earth is going through at the cost of our progress. It is time to face the music.At the end of the film, contrasting the image of the Earthrise, which is perhaps the most influential environmental photograph ever taken, Gore talks about another photograph (the one above). It is a photograph taken by the Voyager 1 spacecraft taken from a record distance of 6.4 billion kilometers away. Known as 'Pale Blue Dot', the image is exactly as its name tells us. It is the Earth, lost in the vastness of space, a small dot in the middle of nowhere. An insignificant speck on the face of the Universe.. Or is it?Care.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An important movie?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Who is Al Gore? "I used to be the next president of the United States." Indeed, his life and career would suggest him one of the most American of Americans. However, is his movie any good? The Academy Awards suggest so, having won Best Documentary.An Inconvenient Truth, a documentary by Davis Guggenheim, features Al Gore's slideshow presentations on global warming along with his personal excursions to the Arctic, Antarctic, etc. Apparently he has presented over a thousand times in cities around the world. Along with clips of these presentations, the documentary shows images rarely seen outside of the exclusive scientific community. This is somewhat reflective of Gore's presentations, that they usually attended by those already informed along with the media and corporate and political dignitaries. This movie, then, is made for the rest of us.Who is this man? Albert Gore is born into an upper class American family with his childhood split between Washington D.C. and a farm in Tennessee (his daddy was a Senator). He served in Vietnam as an army reporter and had later careers in law, politics, business, etc. Most notably he served as Vice President under Clinton and has ran for office twice. He is very eclectic. The film also suggests bits and pieces of Gore's own motives for his dedication to the environment.Critiques for this movie may come from attacks on Gore's character- that he is too rich, or that he is too American. Both of which, though true, hardly detracts from the reality presented by the film. Apparently we have the technology required to reverse the trends but somehow it just isn't happening- why? You best judge for yourself. As Gore puts it, this is a moral issue, which is personal. He also suggests that the choices are somewhat limited and a society of procrastination is quickly turning into one of consequence.An Inconvenient Truth has been out on DVD for a while and I would recommend watching it by any means necessary.-G.G.</fullReview>

What kind of POLITICAL statement, in a movie that says it is not about politics, is this? What were the sections about his life and upbringing have to do with GLOBAL WARMING? Sure, this movie was VERY IMPORTANT, and GLOBAL WARMING is the MOST IMPORTANT catastrophe happening to us today! But, I ask: Why did GORE place so many SELF-SERVING segments in this movie about GLOBAL WARMING? Why indeed, if this movie was really the precursor to him throwing his hat in the ring for the next presidential election race? My answer, is that this movie was CONVENIENT to Mr. Gore. Sure, he imparted an important message that I respect. BUT WHY mix it with politics if he keeps saying that it is not? I ask you...Why?</fullReview>

We'd been trying for a month, but when your video store (Video Busters, the best video store around these days) only has 2 copies, you might have to wait a while.The movie is all about the hot topic these days, global warming. I knew global warming had something to do with pollution, but that's about it. Now I could write an essay on it (although i'd probably get a D, so.....). The format of the movie is Al Gore addressing a uni class, with other clips inserted of his push in various avenues (a bit self-glorifying at times) It's informative, and forces you to think about taking some action, and is comforting as most of it is America's fault, something you don't hear a lot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Scientific Theory vs "A Theory"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was a good movie and inspired me to look further into alternate energies and minimizing my impact on energy consumption.I wanted to point a common misconception on the term theory. A scientific theory is an established and experimentally verified fact or collection of facts about the world. Unlike the everyday use of the word theory, scientific theory is NOT an unproved idea, or even just some theoretical speculation. In science, the everyday use of the word "theory" is called hypothesis.A previous comment mentions that you should not have to "believe" in a scientific theory. Its not about belief in a theory (see above).After viewing this movie, I gained a lot of respect for Al Gore. At the very least, I think that if the movie is viewed with an open mind, it can inspire you to change your habits. Both alternate energy sources and improved energy consumption are two commercial areas that will continue to grow and will be very profitable in the future. As the U.S. auto industry stagnates and falls other international companies, this may be the next wave for the US economy.Some have claimed that Gore warns of much greater climate change than scientific estimates. If anything, Gore's warnings are in-line with the range of scientific predictions.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have met Al Gore, personally. I found him to be very stiff in his posture and a boring speaker in 92. However, the Inconvenient Truth is a Baby boomer's wake up call edited slickly. It takes what could've been a boring hour and made it a life story about AL GORE! He has devoted his life to taking care of global warming. Hybrid cars made in Tennessee Toyota plants, saw grass research done at University Of Tennessee and other ties to Tennessee industries aside, the film is very forceful in it's presentation. He could've sat back like his father and lived a very easy southern life as a Tobacco Farmer and Us Senator. He decided to go into politics?

		<shortDescription>what a Great Man</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Why should I credit the director? He clearly hasn't got the franchise. His role, just like at the Oscars, is to look up at his Leader with doggie eyes, and he does this with aplomb. Now, I'm a reasonable man; this movie would probably convince Siue's dad that global warming is not 'cyclical,' which is worthy work, and I'm sure Gore is doing more good out of office than in. But you will not learn from this movie that Democrats ever did anything bad regarding anything at all; you will not learn that oil companies have interests that do indeed conflict with those of other 'people'; you will not learn that saving the world involves more than recycling and praying and leaving politicians to their most worthy work. Gore made a slide show about global warming; the hacks behind the camera chose to make a movie about Gore. That is the true meaning of all the personal interstitial stuff down on the ranch and so on; instead of opening up the context, the movie NARROWS it to this one guy, like we were stupid and needed a leader. Gore plays into this for sure, but I'd certainly rather see his sales pitch live than mediated through the catastrophic Great Man Alone framework that makes the entire documentary field such an endless gift to STOPPING the changes that will enable us to survive. Of course, if it had tried to be anything else it would never have been distributed. Maddening.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Year That Oscar's PC Was Confirmed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 2004, the political agenda of network broadcasting was confirmed. In our hearts, we knew it all along. When Dan Rather shouted "We got him" and rushed to bad judgment about the false national guard documents, all doubt was removed.Similarly, in 2007, it became abundantly clear that Oscar was a PC shill. When movies receive votes for their political correctness instead of their entertainment or artistic merit, the value of any Oscar is inevitably diminished.Inconvenient Truth is nothing more than poorly executed propaganda. Gore's wooden style is a metaphor for this travesty, which will someday rank with "Reefer Madness" as a sign of myopic times.Although Gore invented the Internet (and perhaps the wheel), I'd like to get my information from true scientists. Unfortunately, any climatologist who questions the orthodoxy of Global Warming is losing his/her job. Perhaps someday this scaremongering will be recognized in the same class as ill-founded concerns over breast implants and electric transmission lines. The trash bin of history can't come too soon for Inconvenient Truth.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not so fast Mr. Gore. Consider this reality first.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am the founder of a small independent non-profit research company that has done research on the issue of global warming. I have made some very important and telling discoveries that need to be shared, considered, and investigated further. My findings show that the human thermal energy contribution into the aquatic environment over the past two hundred years has in fact been semi accumulative in relation to the aquatic environments ability to release that thermal energy, beyond the natural amount of thermal energy that was already being feed into this aquatic structure by it's direct contact with the surface of the earth from below and from the solar and tropical contribution from above. This reality can be better understood once one realizes just how much thermal contribution is naturally being transferred into this aquatic structure through its outer surface, and just how little of the outer structure is actually releasing more thermal energy than it is taking it. That figure is in fact roughly a very small percentage of somewhere between 7 to 15 percent. That means that over 85 percent of the aquatic structure's outer surface is already naturally drawing in or absorbing thermal energy, thus cannot release our human contribution, which means, that even though the energy is being dispersed rapidly and greatly undetectable, it is still being trapped or suspended within this aquatic environment. The only place that this added unnatural energy has to go is down into the colder deep waters that act like a massive natural heat-sink. Problem is; this structure was isolated from the entire outer surface of the aquatic environment until recently. It used to draw in and down all of the thermal energy that nature through its way and still was able to maintain its strength and integrity. But since humanities massive contribution has directly invaded it. The size and strength of this deep cold water structure has diminished to the point that some very serious changes have occurred, that apparently only I've realized or detected up until now. The once isolated structure is now releasing vast amounts of that trapped thermal contribution into the areas where the direction of thermal transfer has been changed from a natural downwards direction to an upwards direction for the very first time in hundreds of millions of years. Thus melting off the ice at a rapid rate due to the abnormal stimulation of the molecular environment pushing up the freezing temperature of that environment. Thank you! Randall Scott</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie is a platform for change - regardless.If you want to see a tree-hugging, sky-is-falling, chicken little doc full of little liberal conspiracies and hogwash - then that's what you'll see, even if the world temperature happened to climb 200 degrees as you were watching it. However, for any remaining concerned humans with their heads out of the sand and their ears to the ground this serves not as a be-all-to-end-all, but as a call for an open mind to the issue and POTENTIAL that the data suggests - right or wrong. I'll never understand the mentality that suggests that because 100% of an observation is not incontrovertible that the whole thing should therefore be dismissed ("You're only 97% correct - what an idiot!"). Likewise for the assertion that because you can't offer a 100% solution then your input and observations should be wholly ignored and negated for that reason. Until someone offers a reversal study that demonstrates that increasing our population, stuffing our world full of pollution, stripping our resources, and pumping our atmosphere full of gasses actually contradicts the issues or affects suggested at in 'An Inconvenient Truth' then there really is no reason to not embrace the ideas wholeheartedly, without political affiliation, and with immediacy. Note: 'embracing an idea' does not mean that you're weak, or that you have to scrap your beliefs, or that you have to become ignorant to the other side of an issue, or that you have to become a partisan lemming - it only means you have to stay open to the 'possibility' of things...I agree that super-left Democrats should see it for reasons of impending action and deeper inquiry, and that super-right Republicans should see it if only for it's numerous dismissal opportunities due to it's 'liberal' association and long term message. See it and think. No more, no less.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Everyone Owes It To Themselves To See This Film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Al Gore is a Liberal, a Democrat, but he does not intend this movie as a manifestation of politics. It exposes and demonstrates the truth as it represents agreement among the world's experts.Why people would avoid assessing how they feel about facts like global warming being real, that it is caused by human activity, that humankind and its governments are obliged to launch high-priority action to stop and overturn it. Is there any true merit to avoid these concepts because you didn't vote for Al Gore? If we do nothing, in about 10 years the earth could arrive at a "tipping point" and begin a slide toward devastation of our civilization and most of the species on this planet. After the planet touches that peak, it will be too late for any chance of halting or reversing it.These facts are stated by Al Gore. Disregard that he ever ran for office. Regard him as an alarmed person going to great lengths and efforts around the world to speak out about the impending destruction. He stands on a stage in front of a sizable screen, before an audience. The documentary depicts him giving a demonstration he had been developing for six years, substantiated by remarkable visuals. He shows the famous photograph taken from space by the first American astronauts, then a series of later space photographs, noticeably signifying that glaciers and lakes are dwindling, snows are melting, shorelines are receding.He presents figures and data: The 10 hottest years in the history of our existence were all recent. Hurricanes are hitting places that have never suffered hurricanes before. Pacific typhoons are setting records. Katrina went from Category 3 to Category 5. Cores of polar ice show that carbon dioxide is much, much higher than ever in the past 250,000 years. It was once thought that such things went in cycles, but Gore stands before a graph showing them over the centuries. Yes, there is a cycle, but lately, the graph keeps going higher and higher, off the chart.The key man-made root of global warming is the burning of fossil fuels, taking energy stored over hundreds of millions of years as coal, gas and oil, and discharging it rapidly. This initiates global warming, and seeing as glaciers and snow mirror sunlight but sea water soaks it up, the more the ice melts, the more of the sun's energy is hung on to by the sea.Gore says that although there is "100 percent agreement" among scientists, a database search of newspaper and magazine articles shows that 57 percent question the fact of global warming, while 43 percent support it. These figures are the result, he says, of a disinformation campaign started in the 1990s by the energy industries to "reposition global warming as a debate." It is the same strategy used for years by the defenders of tobacco, and to some extent, those of the pharmaceutical, alcohol and meat industries.The director, Davis Guggenheim, uses words, images and Gore's concise litany of facts to build a film that is fascinating and relentless. Everyone owes it to themselves to see this film. If you have children and grandchildren, you owe it to them, too. Yes, I am implying that you should feel guilty if you deliberately avoid this movie. I think that to be objective and fair on the issue of global warming necessitates that one has to take Gore's view. There is no other position that can be supported. The Republican chairman of the Senate Environment Committee has said, "Global warming is the greatest hoax ever perpetrated on the American people." Whether you dislike Gore and favor the aforementioned Senator or vice versa, consider the evidence. Consider which stance can be defended.</fullReview>

If you want special effects and a hero &amp; heroine then you are mistaken so please don't comment on this title with such considerations in mind.Al Gore is making a difference and if he uses political tactics to do so then it is only as a result of his profession. You know he did go for presidency and was ousted by a cretin. Perhaps this validates his honesty a little don't you think? Gore is a good speaker and captivates his audience.

I'm just not too happy by the fact that this movie focused a lot on irrelevant things and i would say about 50 percent of the movie had absolutely nothing at all to do with the movie. it talks about how many times he has done this speech, 1000 times at least, big deal get on with it, talks about his childhood and family, nobody cares get on with it, talks about the election he lost, he lost nothing can be changed get over it, and get on with it.all in all see for yourself perhaps you will be totally gripped by al gores life along with the global warming on the side as filler</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Notice Something Interesting in the Comments Section?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are too many comments about the relative merits and faults of this documentary for mine to add much; without being a scientist himself, Al Gore has exhaustively compiled, over many years, all of the studies/findings he can accumulate that point to the possibility of global warming. Yes, there are some moments of implied bitterness sprinkled here and there about his loss to Bush by dubious Supreme Court decisions. His documentary has been attacked because it does not show both pros and cons of the global warming debate equally. However, if it did, it would make no point. There are two interesting points, both in the documentary, and in the comments section for this documentary: Gore actually got ahold of an internal memo from a corporation that flatly stated its intention to "reposition" the global warming findings not as a scientific conclusion, but as a "theory", by paying media &amp; "experts" to raise doubts; an undertaking that succeeded. The second interesting point is if the reader goes to the "hated it" section of the comments section, they will find extensive refutations of Gore's documentary, not written by the average viewer, but by what appear to be paid writers &amp; journalists that exhaustively refute point by point the documentary film from beginning to end, complete with references and quotes from everyone they can find, scientist or not, that disagree with the documentary. These "comments" don't read like comments, but like editorials in the Nation and other right-wing gung-ho publications. They are so obvious it is funny. And there are a Lot of these so-called comments! If you read some of them, the writers seem to have shot themselves in the foot; they reveal themselves not as average viewers, but as part of the interests that seek to cast doubt the global warming findings. There are dozens of these comments, many appearing to be clones of each other, and some of them even quoting the conservative senator who attacked the concept of global warming! "The greatest single hoax perpetrated on the world" is found over and over again in some of these "comments". If there is no conspiracy to cast doubt on the global warming issue, why are there so many of these attacks that read like editorial pieces appearing here? And this is just IMDb we're talking about. There is way too much energy being spent on trying to debunk Gore's warning, by way too many writers, citing facts and figures your average viewer wouldn't have at his fingertips. Read the "hated it" section of the comments and you'll see what I mean. It's goofy and strangely unsettling at the same time, that such a large group of fake commentors would go to so much trouble to so aggressively refute every word coming out of his mouth.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Al Gore Will Be Right Back After This Important Corporate Commercial Message</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film very much plays like a Corporate Managers Power Point Presentation to his employees. It is designed like a pitch that a manager makes to convince his employees that the company is right and they are wrong. Gore does it here, &amp; if you have seen many of these corporate honchos doing pitches, you will see through the smoke &amp; mirrors of the presentation. Note- this film has no credit for anyone writing the script. That should sound an alarm as no one wants to take credit for writing any of the content.What is interesting is that the current global economic crisis is in large part happening because the global banking system has no previous experience doing business with modern technology like the world wide web &amp; cell phones, etc factored in. An Inconvenient Truth is that if Al Gore invented the Internet as he claims, he is responsible for the current crisis. Since Gore didn't do that nor invent Power Point presentations, there is not much to be said for his theories. The power point should clue the viewer in - this is a major corporate effort to make money by fooling the viewer into a belief that will sell their products. In other words, the film is a defined Corporate Commercial.Reality is a recent study by Swiss &amp; German Scientists that conclusively proves that our sun is in a hotter burning cycle. Evidence includes polar ice caps on Mars are melting too. There is Archelogical evidence that proves the sun has had these cycles before in Earth history &amp; the earth has survived. This is real science backed up by NASA &amp; Archelogists whether you like it or not.Global warming is a religion being preached by people wishing to make money while cherry picking statistics. Man really controls how hot the earth gets? Get real - Sun Cycles are the Scientific view that can be backed up with facts. Warming &amp; cooling of the earth are cycles, &amp; change from year to year, month to month, day to day.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Changes in global weather is a reality. What is NOT a reality is the dire predictions and unscientific data hawked by Gore. The New York Times has recently found that this work is alarmist in nature, and should be tempered with "real" science.We are likely to incur a 30 year cooling period beginning soon (between now and 2010), and the oceans will rise...about 23 inches, not feet! There have been cycles up to 20 times worse than right now, without affecting a polar shift. There have been at least 10 times, according to the experts, when global warming was a greater threat than right now.The UN Report states categorically that there is NO BASIS for believing Gore's presentation.My question is why? Why did it take over a year and an Oscar win to make the scientific community stand up and say, "Wait! Gore is exaggerating!" He is creating a culture of fear where we are not even allowed to question this. They are teaching this in SCHOOLS now! They know if they get the kids, then have the generations to come.The c02 doesn't cause global warming. There has been no rise, so you can't blame that. The last big rise was in 1945, and global warming didn't occur! You have to stop the consensus of the HYPE! The incentive is 6.2 billion dollars US a year to make us believe this. They are using scare tactics and gross exaggerations to make us buy into their money machine. Listen to Glenn Beck, and feel your intelligence rise!I've nothing for this bull***t, and I wish the populous was more intelligent than to buy into it.This piece of detritus rates a 0.0/10 from...the Fiend :.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>AN INCONVENIENT TRUTH Directed by Davis GuggenheimThe crowd is hushed in anxious anticipation as the man they wait for makes his way through the maze of the backstage corridors. The fervor builds as the man stops to shake another's hand, pose for a photograph. We can only see him from behind. We can barely make out who it is. Until, the wait comes to its end. Ladies and gentlemen, the man you've all been waiting for, The self-described man who used to be the next president of the United States, Al Gore! And, the crowd explodes in a respectfully enthusiastic show of admiration and reasonable applause.In AN INCONVENIENT TRUTH, former Vice-President of the United States, Al Gore, plays host to a lecture series audience on the impending impact global warming will have on our planet in his and your potential life time. Although it may sound odd in passing, Gore's lecture series has been given around the globe, hundreds of times. In the time since he lost the bid for presidency, he has rededicated his life and passion to the subject of global warming and made it his priority to increase the awareness of its importance to people everywhere. Contrary to what one might expect from a lecture given by Gore, for example a long snooze, this particular series is actually thoroughly engaging. Of course, the subject matter itself is compelling enough as Gore walks us through image after time-lapsed image demonstrating a shockingly sparse amount of ice where once there was plenty and numerous graphs, be them bar or line, showing significant hikes in temperature and carbon dioxide emissions in the earth's atmosphere from recent years. No matter the topic, one needs a compelling host to make sure the message hits where it should. The shock of the advanced progression of global warming may end up taking a back seat to the complete personality readjustment of Al Gore as he is charming, witty, sarcastic without being obnoxious and ultimately very comfortable, both with the material and himself. One can't help but wonder why he didn't demonstrate this side of himself when running for the presidency in the first place.One also can't help but wonder that because filmmaker Davis Guggenheim breaks up Gore's seminar with allusion to Gore's past from his upbringing to the election debacle in the state of Florida in 2000. The goal is to demonstrate how Gore came to be crusading for global warming awareness. Drawing a link between the death of his sister from lung cancer due to years and years of excessive cigarette smoking despite the knowledge of it's likely tragic outcome and the general population's ignorance towards the effects of global warming and our need for tragedy to inspire action is one thing. Drawing a link between a near-fatal car accident his son had when he was very young and Gore's conviction towards the importance of human life makes sense but detracts from the focus of the film. Gore's motivation or interest in the subject seems almost entirely irrelevant as the film is about the presentation, not the guy giving it. Not only does this filler detract but it also taints. Bringing up America's decision to ultimately vote George W. Bush into office seems somewhat damning, as if to suggest that global warming is not getting any better because of you America. You voted for someone who doesn't care about the environment and therefore disasters like Hurricane Katrina, which the film says was much worse due to the warming of the ocean water it traveled over between Florida and New Orleans, might not have been as bad had you voted in a president that cared about the planet. I'm sure Guggenheim isn't trying to make such strong accusations but the implication is still made through his editing and the film falls off track occasionally as a result.AN INCONVENEINT TRUTH is being dubbed the "Must-See" documentary of the summer, picking up where past hits THE MARCH OF THE PENGUINS and FARENHEIT 9/11 have left off. I have a difficult time agreeing with this praise. I do believe it to be must-see but this is because the content is important and the facts need to heard. And albeit an enjoyable experience, the content cannot be all that is judged as it is still a film and it is one that is flawed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Problem(?) Fig. on p65 of Gore's book: Inconvenient Truth</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I believe in global warming. As a scientists, though, I am concerned with some data in the movie, which is also a Figure on p65 of Gore book: An Inconvenient Truth. This figure shows temperature as a function of time from 1000CE - present. (1) Why is there BOTH red (hot) and blue (cold) data in the period toward the right (the period from ~1950-present, when there is only red OR blue data elsewhere?(2) By normalizing to data from 1961-1990, Gore is accentuating the red period (hot) from ~1950-present. If the data were normalized for 1000 - 1900CE, then there would be other regions (e.g. 1000 - 1400CE) that would also be red (hot). The latter makes the especially HOT period from ~1900 - present more obvious (and it IS HOTTER!), but it does seem misleading.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Movie is nothing but informative. It is clearly a product of ignorance and false evidence. This is why:1.) Authors only mentioned scientific research that supports the idea of global warming. However, countless legitimate scientific researches that doesn't support author's opinion have been ignored. This makes this documentary un-objective and ignorant.2.) Authors have decided to play emotional card on people: Al Gore's life (which is irrelevant to global warming) was glorified and sometimes it looked like the movie is about him and his "humble" life in "service" for the people. Half of the movie Al Gore is talking about his childhood, family and other stuff unrelated with the idea of global warming, and this is to make him look as a good person and bring empathy, which is out of place in a documentary. This movie is very boring and teels only one side of theory. I, personally believe that it is a piece of propaganda to help justify CO2 taxation and divert people's attention from the real problems in the world.</fullReview>

This film is very good, done by the man who should have been President of the USA. They should run it on TV. It is well paced, informative, and shows what people who want positive changes in North Americas pollution standards are up against in terms of a thick as a brick mentality that resists the solutions to these pressing issues. I believe that the new litter of cars that are supposed to be 'green cars' for 2010 frequently have pollution standards that are exceeded by standard cars made by Ford in the early 1970s.

I'm not sure if performance is the correct word to use but I've certainly never seen him so entertaining as he is here. The film itself is a rather interesting one, although I've seen better stuff on the Discovery Channel and other programs. This film is certainly one sided and I would have liked to have seen Gore debate this topic with others but that's not the point of the film. The film works well in telling and showing what's going on and in the end it certainly makes you think.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The companion piece to the former VP's book of the same name, this film is nothing more than a recording of Mr. Gore droning through a slide show. While Mr. Gore's wooden presentation may be a cure for insomnia, his editor and cinematographer deserve kudos. They were able to hide the fact that some of the slides Mr. Gore used as 'evidence' actually belie many of his proofs. He also fails to mention that nearly 20% of the scientists whose names are on the UN report that forms the foundation of his hypothesis had to threaten to sue the UN to have their names removed from the report...because they disagreed with the report's conclusions. Also, for every scientist who agrees with Mr. Gore's assertions, there is at least one (including the Meterological Scientist who founded The Weather Channel as well as NASA's chief Meterologist) who disagrees. So, Mr. Gore, the debate is not over. Overall, this is nothing more than a propaganda film for the modern Progressive movement.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This American documentary is interesting to watch and think about problems of climate change and the possibility to change it.The lecture with slides of Al Gore is interesting to listen to, though in some episodes words coming from the vocabulary of ecologists do create minutes of the viewer's bore. However, it is in many cases avoided with the humorous remarks. The narrator (Al Gore) even uses satyric cartoon disclosing the problem of climate change solution.From time to time in some episodes one can get the feeling that the narrator is the lone soldier on the battle for climate change, the politician who suffered a lot and lost the elections.Therefore, one should remember the additional footage in which Al Gore discusses the additional facts dealing with climate change (in the DVD edition for the UK).Therefore, one should remember the nine errors noticed by the High Court in the UK as discussed in the articles of the newspapers (The Times of October 10, 2007 and others) to get the real vision of the climate change problem.Nevertheless, the documentary is really an interesting to watch, re-watch and think about your actions how to avoid climate change, Your possible actions are explained at the end of the movie with the clear, concise text and reference to the website.Undoubtedly, this documentary adds new ideas to the context of climate change awareness all over the world.Undoubtedly, it does shape and will shape the ideas of people about climate change...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's impossible to say whether future generations will one day look back on Al Gore as "the man who saved the planet," but they will at least be able to point to the documentary "An Inconvenient Truth" as the key factor in leading the ex-Vice President back from the political wilderness.Once an object of ridicule and scorn for many on both sides of the political aisle, Gore has recently achieved near-rock star status thanks largely to his unwavering commitment to awakening the people of the world to the very-real dangers posed by global warming. Armed with charts, graphs, photographs, and an unbridled passion that is truly infectious, Gore makes a convincing case in this film not only that global warming is indeed real but that if we don't act now to counter its influence, the world we live in will soon be a much less hospitable place in which to raise our kids and grandkids. Given the evidence that has piled up over recent years backing his claims, it's hard for even the most cynical among us not to see Gore in oracular terms."An Inconvenient Truth" is essentially a big screen version of the sophisticated slide show that Gore has been presenting for years to largely sympathetic audiences. What's most surprising, given his reputation for pomposity, condescension and stiffness, is just how relaxed, witty and avuncular Gore appears on screen as he ever so patiently and succinctly lays out material and data that could, in less capable hands, have come across as dry, arcane and incomprehensible to a less than scientifically literate lay audience. The movie also shows how some of the events in his own personal life - the near-death of his son in an accident, the bitter loss of the election in 2000 - awakened Gore's consciousness and led him to educate himself and take the lead on an issue that has always meant so much to him.Like any good social crusader, Gore first raises public awareness of the problem then offers concrete steps that individuals, corporations and governments can take to help solve it. With the spirit of a revivalist preacher, Gore implores everyone with a conscience to come together and do his part to eradicate the threat before it is too late for any of us to truly make a difference.Of course, the most common criticism leveled against the film is that it is little more than anti-capitalist leftwing propaganda, a slanted screed that provides only one side of the argument and that is essentially designed to make big business and the political right look like villains. And, indeed, unlike in, say, a "60 Minutes" segment on the topic, director Davis Guggenheim does not provide equal time - or, to be honest, any time at all - to dissenting voices to make their case. In fact, there are no interviews even with scientists who SUPPORT the claims being put forth by the film, a weakness that has allowed dissenters to charge Gore with playing fast and loose with the facts. This has also led to the second most commonly stated criticism against the film, which is that it comes across at times like a vanity production designed more to rehabilitate Mr. Gore's reputation than to make a legitimate scientific case for global warming. I guess it would be possible to make such an argument against the movie, but the literature sure seems to back Gore on his assertions, and his commitment to the issue certainly comes across as both deep-seated and genuine. He is, after all, no Johnny-come-lately to the scene, having devoted much of his adult life to the cause, long before it was trendy to do so.For most free-thinking, forward-looking people, "An Inconvenient Truth" will be both an eye-opening and a mind-opening experience. For those who don't fall into that category, it may soon be time to break out the surfboards and get ready to ride the waves down 5th Avenue.</fullReview>

I would like to challenge all of the narrow-minded 4 year politicians, that if we don't have a habitable planet to live on, the Economy won't be an issue, because there will be none!

		<fullReview>An Inconvenient Truth is, to say the least, a very sobering film. I had already knew most of the information that Al Gore was discussing in his film, but that doesn't stop it from being interesting, and to the film's credit, there is a vast sum of information which i didn't know that not only is highly complex, but made easy to understand. First off, there are many interesting facts such as the explanation to the whole debate over global warming. Gore explains that a panel of god knows how many researchers showed that all of them, despite their political affiliations, all agreed that global warming is real, and is resulting in consequential events. Many more facts are explained via Gore's speech, which is surprisingly entertaining as it is informative.Gore has a natural tone which is very absorbing, not at all like the stone reputation he has warranted over the years. A trait he commonly pokes fun at. And in response to the films cut aways to mini biographies of Gore's life, some say this is distracting and unneeded. But what they fail to realize is that without these cuts, the film would be one long seminar. It's better to break it down into separate parts in order to not put a strain on the viewers. And, the biographies are not only interesting themselves, but do serve a purpose to the film. They show the reason why Gore is so passionate about this and that he is not some overly concerned individual. More so, they are personally inspiring. The most important message the film conveys is that Global Warming is not a political issue. Liberal or Conservative, this effects us all equally.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The documentary built on facts</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's too bad I didn't know about this side of Al Gore back in 2000. I would've voted for him if I had known. I heard much about this film being powerful and influential with indisputable data before seeing it and I have to say that I'm quite surprised to see a few naysayers even on this website. It must be that these people have some personal quibble with Gore or some other strange problem. It could actually be that they are crazy. Yeah that's right. The simple truth is that this film does make an indisputable argument for global warming and the causes behind it. And, the main cause is the United States of America and it's backwards governments. I say "governments" because it's not just the Bush administration. It has been happening for a very long time. Ever since, as we see in the film, Gore was in college, when one of his professors was trying to prove the increase over many years of carbon dioxide in the earth's atmosphere, has the government tried to silence the global warming argument. At odds with the causes for global warming are old habits that are now a deeply rooted part of our economy. This has been an aspect of the global warming problem that I thought would always be difficult to resolve. But, it turns out from seeing this film, the exact opposite is true. Being Eco-friendly now benefits the economy as we have seen with Japan's cars which as everyone knows are number one. One reason why American cars can't compete with Japanese cars on the global level is that we cannot sell our cars in many countries including China and Japan because of their strict laws regarding emissions. So, it's not a problem of our efforts hurting the economy when we choose to implement Eco-friendly laws. The film also points out many misconceptions about whether scientists agree on the occurrence of global warming. It is not argued over because now not one medical journal out of just under one thousand has disputed the evidence in favor of it. The most convincing argument I saw in the film regarding global warming was the pictures showing icebergs and glaciers now and 20-50 years ago. If there is any evidence that supports global warming this is certainly the most convincing. The film shows pictures of Glacier National Park, Mt. Kilamanjaro, the Swiss Alps, Greenland, Alaska, Artica and Antartica. And guess what? All of these pictures show the same thing: melting ice. That's why the people who bash this film for being untruthful must have either not seen it, or they are in a state of tremendous denial. There have been a few gripes about how Al Gore makes this film about himself a little more than is acceptable. But, this aspect of it takes nothing away from the general presentation of the problem. It only serves to show that the man is sincere in his quest to present this evidence in favor of global warming to people all over the world. The man should be awarded for his dedication because there truly is no greater problem facing humans than the threat of climate change in the next 50 years. But, the problem is that the change will sneak up on us. And before we all know we'll wonder why we didn't listen to Al Gore and accept the inconvenient truths he has so lucidly presented. Therefore don't pay attention to the detractors. They truly don't live in reality.</fullReview>

But I think it loses a lot of its emotional effect by resorting to stats to explain most things. He takes very bourgeois and anthropocentric approaches to a number of issues, for instance his idea that we need to overcome global warming by becoming even more technological, and blaming poor countries for overpopulation when overconsumption by the West is by far more a problem. I am glad that he put this film together because it helps to make people aware of the problem. But his very moderate solutions seem extremely optimistic. Sadly, even his weak reforms would never survive a vote in Congress because as the saying goes, the business of government is business. And though environmental reform might be great for everyone in the long term, in the short term they're always going to pick the bars of gold.</fullReview>

However I found it a little patronising and the examples used could all be Winter/Summer footage and even warm year cool year variations in the climate. The real truth is that in 100 hundred years time we can look back and say yes it was Global warming, caused by people-kind but by then we'll have 20% less arable land to feed 100% more people. Not to mention the methane coming up from the seabed and the Siberian tundra. Most European's will be aware of these facts and the next step is to stop out-gassing in committees and actually take action. see www.tax-aviation-fuel.com.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I work at the CN Tower in Toronto and one day my boss and I looked down on the city and noticed how nice the weather was. People were jogging in t-shirts and it was a bright clear day with mid-to-high teens in the temperature (measured in Celsius). There was one problem though. This was December, this year! My boss mentioned that, "man cannot be simply ignorant anymore. This is the time of global warming." Seeing the weather outside proved extremely difficult in proving him otherwise. This January of 2006, where I lived in the Peel Region of Ontario, I saw for the first time in my life, not only grass on the ground in January, but NOT ONE SNOWFALL DURING THE MONTH! When I saw the DVD at the rental store, I knew I was going to watch what I already know, but the real question is, why isn't there any measures to stop this? The story of Al Gore and his demonstration on global warming, its causes and its impact on us, here and now and in the future.Al Gore's slide shows show us not just what we know, but how severe it actually has become. This movie has become the most effective tool for soliciting, nearly enforcing, change. Here in Canada, our current Prime Minister, Stephen Harper, Time Magazine's Canadian of the Year, and his party, have been slammed so hard for their lackluster environment policy, that they have to rewrite the whole plan from scratch and take a more stern stance on the Kyoto Protocol, something our country has also been lacking on. Our Green Party, of all things, who have not one elected seat in Parliament, have had over one million votes last election and is slowly gaining acceptance.When you see the movie, take a look at how everything's changed, in the weather and since the movie has come out. Right now outside, it's bright, with the sun beaming warmth on my face from the window with a couple clouds outside. Not one speck of snow in +5 degree weather. 15 years ago, I would have been tobogganing and making snowmen and forts at this time. With less than a week away, it's likely that this is the third year in a row where there is no white Christmas.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An unexpected treasure! Entertaining and inspiring.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this reluctantly in my capacity as an occasional film reviewer and I was thrilled by it. It is entertaining and well presented, clear and reasonable (what a contrast to Michael Moore, who hops around all over the place, makes wild unsubstantiated claims and can't resist a snide tone most of the time). But just as I was thinking, I better move to a mountain top and have no children, Gore shows how we can reverse this terrifying trend, how we can all band together and do something wonderful - it's not too late. I was profoundly moved, by his commitment and his inspiring example. Have committed to reduce my CO2 emissions to zero (he says this is completely possible) by end 2007. Go and see it, it's much more moving and engaging than I could have imagined.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Does it matter who is right or wrong?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought this was a great film, sure there is debate about the facts being correct or not, but most of this debate is in America and I think that is one of the best points of the movie. The rest of the world has come to the conclusion that climate change is a reality and we have changed our habits of the past to reduce our impacts on the planet. Why would every other major country in the world except America increase their emission standards? Perhaps thats why Gore claims that Americans still contribute the most CO2 emissions per capita than any other country. Get with the programme guys and even if "Global Warming" does turn out to be untrue, at the end of the day we will all end up with a cleaner environment - and surely that alone has got to be worth changing for?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a solid documentary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Al Gore has been in the lime light, promoting the destructive force of global warming. Since college years and into his Vice Presidencey, Gore has constantly tried to push his facts and bring this message to the public; trying to shake the global public wake. After his term in Office, Gore travelled the world to spread the message. Armed with the simple Powerpoint Presentation, Gore has presented his talk over one thousand times.An Inconvenient Truth focuses on one of his presentations. Methodically planned out, with facts abundant, Gore lays out the facts one by one. With each new fact, his ultimate goal and message constantly becomes ever so clear; things need to change. Through simple pictures and graphs, the illuminated facts are powerful and stark.Even though An Inconvenient Truth is not the greatest documentary ever made, it's one all should see. It really is the wake up call that everyone needs. Facts aren't radicalized and truths twisted, it's all laid out in matter of fact simplicity. With quips and the use of clips from film and shows, The deterring part of An Inconvenient Truth is Al Gore himself. It's not that he's on this "crusade" as such, it's the elements of his past and side stories that detract from the overall message. The insight into Gore and his past while enlightening, distracts from the facts and the message. There is a real positive reinforcement running behind this documentary, but there could have been a harder hitting, fear inducing, element. While shocking what Gore is presenting, this could have scared you wit-less on the bleak future we're heading towards, but ends up more gasping than horrifying.Yet it is the message that is the most important part. Though from the side steps, the facts all come together in the end in and galvanize what Gore's aim is, to change our ways now before it's too late.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Half-truths and outright lies combine to make one big waste of time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having seen REAL scientific evidence concerning global warming, this movie was just as much a waste of film as it was boring. Normally I wouldn't bother to write about something so obviously bad, but when I see so many uninformed people actually believe this steaming pile, I could not let it lie (no pun intended).Scientists agree that the earths' temperature has risen about 0.2-0.6 degrees Centigrade over the last 100 years. Not the 2-6 degrees predicted. If you measure from 0 degrees Kelvin to 275 degrees (where we are) Kelvin, one sixth of a degree is a change of about .18 percent. (If you don't know what Kelvin is, look it up) .18 percent is nothing. If the polar ice caps are going to melt it's going to take a hell of a lot more then a half of a degree.Something that this movie ignores altogether is that the earth has gone through warming and cooling cycles since the beginning of time, including the unexplained medieval heat wave, when it was hotter than it is now.I am not disputing the claim that we are experiencing global warming, but it's not caused by us puny humans, and there is nothing of significance that we can or should do about it.Al Gore should go back to politics and leave the fake documentaries to Michael Moore.</fullReview>

If he'd shown only half the personality he displays here ... he'd be the POTUS right now, instead of George W. Bush and could not only talk about Global Warming (subject of this movie), but do something against it.That's not to say that other can't do anything about it. And although it's difficult to talk about something like that (what irony, talking about power reduction, but using a computer to do so), without being preachy.

		<fullReview>Al Gore triumphant! Didn't think I'd ever say that.I didn't vote for him in 2000. I didn't like him, and thought he'd be no different than Clinton. I thought another four years of Clinton would be a bad thing for this country (nevermind that hindsight is 20-20, and it's hard to imagine how Gore would've been worse than Bush). Say what you want about Bush, but you know what you're getting with him. He doesn't volunteer information, but he's not deceptive like Clinton was. Gore seemed less trustworthy than Bush.Imagine that.Six years later, Gore comes off as charming, likable, intelligent, and funny. Instead of the slimy politician I've always pictured him as, he's very open and personable in this film. Never thought that'd happen.This documentary isn't what I'd thought it'd be. I was hoping for a concise argument for the cause of global warming being anthropogenic in nature. I don't need one, because I've already been convinced of that, but I was hoping this would be a good resource for the argument. That's not what this film is about, however.Instead, Gore summarizes some circumstantial evidence (such as the obvious and well established fact that CO2 levels have jumped off the charts, and have been steadily increasing since the industrial revolution), making only the most basic case for global warming being caused by humanity's actions.Instead, Gore is making a plea to the greatness within us all. Convincingly, he argues that we have it within our power to do something to halt global warming from becoming worse, and that there is still time to save a bit of what is so great about this planet.Ultimately, this film breeds hope, not despair.If you see this film, don't go into it expecting to be convinced that humanity is the cause of global warming (if, for some reason, you don't think that already). He argues that, certainly, but he doesn't devote a lot of time trying to convince you of it. Go into this expecting to hear a concise, clearly stated, and erudite wake-up call by a man who did a marvelous job making me, for one, forget how little I like him.Amazingly, he's the star of this film without overwhelming the topic. Michael Moore should study Gore in this film, because the ex-VP did what Moore's never been able to: make an engaging film that's personal and intelligent without being closed-minded and inflammatory.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The People Who Most Need to See This Documentary Won't</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"An Inconvenient Truth" is an issue-oriented film containing a passionate message by the man who won more votes than George W. Bush did in the 2000 election. Accordingly, potential audiences are likely to approach it as a political film -- and to go it, or stay away from it, precisely because it is Al Gore overtly campaigning on global warming. That's unfortunate, because the people in the audience are already convinced (or prepared to be convinced) by Gore's message while those who decline to see it will not allow themselves to be exposed to a set of facts that are ultimately irrefutable. The question is not whether global warming is real or a false alarm but what to do about it. And what to do about it is a difficult question that requires serious and open-minded debate. Aside from the declining number of political leaders who refuse to acknowledge that the scientific consensus admits of no doubt about the truth that Gore insists on telling, there is really not yet a "Democratic" or "Republican" nor a "liberal" or "conservative" answer on how best to proceed. That debate is yet to come -- and it is yet to come because a large number of people don't want to face the terrible facts marshaled in this documentary devoted to Gore's lecture, data and graphics. "An Inconvenient Truth" is a superb achievement, not just for Gore personally but for Davis Guggenheim who pieced it all together into an utterly persuasive documentary. The best one can hope for, however, is that those who have seen this film will be galvanized into action, forming an irresistible political wave that will breach the dikes in Washington the way that Hurricane Katrina overwhelmed the levies in New Orleans.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I must admit that respectfully listening to environmental analysis, or analysis of any sort, from a former United States senator of either mainstream party challenges my ability to keep an open mind.But there is a time to recognize when one's natural prejudgments descend into an ad hominem fallacy (ad hominem is essentially that the character of a man determines the validity of what he says). Instead, as Sgt. Joe Friday would say, we need "just the facts, Ma'am." And Mr. Gore has assembled quite a few facts in evidence of genuine, relatively near-term environmental threats to human civilization, if not survival. Further, Gore displays a remarkable intellectual courage and integrity in taking his message to audiences around the world.I only have a couple of quibbles: I'd prefer to have more quantitative data on his charts?he does include the data but not always. I'd also like to have had more suggestion of solutions. Finally, I can do without so many of his reminiscences of personal/political life. But on the level of genuine human concern, his personal touch is, well, touching.### An Inconvenient Truth begins with some beautiful space shots of the earth from Apollo and Galileo spacecraft, a rich multicolored oasis spinning in space. Our atmosphere is the most vulnerable part of our ecosystem because it is so thin: it is equivalent to the thickness of the veneer on a desktop globe.In college Gore was a student of Dr. Roger Revelle, who in the mid 1950s with Charles David Keeling began to measure atmospheric carbon quantities. Carbon was ratcheting up yearly. As CO2 increases in the atmosphere, more radiation is retained, warming the earth. It ain't voodoo science.Now we're seeing the effects, the 10 hottest years on record have occurred over the previous 16 years.Glaciers are receding, Arctic ice is melting, Antarctic ice is melting, Greenland ice is melting, the latter two runoffs causing ocean levels to rise. Because of the increased temperatures of the water, hurricanes are much more intense, e.g. Katrina. Recent news stories warn ocean warming is disrupting the food chain.I just read a story in the AP this a.m. (12/10/06) "Balmy temps, lack of snow may cancel out Europe's winter." This isn't only bad news for ski operators: much of the water supply for Europe comes from runoff of mountain sources.By the middle of the 21st century, unless something is done, the temperatures and carbon dioxide will be off the charts.What can we do? Obviously, reduce carbon emissions from burning fossil fuels. Also find ways to scavenge carbon from the air?my personal recommendation is massive worldwide cultivation of hemp or other prolific vegetation with wide benefits. That's just me.Many other actions are available and we need to act, like, you know, now. Climate science is a complicated business, but virtually no scientist argues that the gross effects of higher anthropogenic CO2 and warmer global temperatures are not catastrophic.For my complete review of this movie and for other movie and book reviews, please visit my site TheCoffeeCoaster.com.Brian Wright Copyright 2007</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The facts and science are on Al's side</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Al Gore has presented an excellent, breath-taking document. Mostly, it's something we've already heard, but it's wisely enriched with surprising and shocking facts. I think Al has chosen a very efficient way to talk to the people. Talking to intellectual elite, scientists and politicians is not what can make a change. Showing people - the general public - the truth, while making points, suggestions, encouraging them in thinking and taking action is the best way to actually push things forward. The facts and science are on Al's side. He seems to be very educated in the problem. He seems sincere and concerned. His message is at least 90 % scientific and nature-oriented, max. 10 % political. The movie is very interesting to watch. The only weaker moments of the document to get through are the passages of Al driving through nature or sights on dad's farm, that lack further point. It's good that Al has brought himself to the message, but these passages do not seem to have as much value in the document as it was probably expected by the producers. I would recommend this movie to everyone that is aware of importance of environment, would like to know more about it, hoping for a twist in the direction of civilization of the past 50 years.</fullReview>

He has finally learned how to talk to an audience (with the back up of a GREAT team of visual aid people). Despite the inter-weaving of personal "insights", which reach into the realm of self-promotion, and the occasional tug at your heart strings, this is one of the smoothest flowing, best organized, highly savvy media presentations I have ever seen. If nothing else, media students need to study it. ALL THAT ASIDE, he makes good points in a variety of ways and does not often cheapen the subject with excessive pot-shots at the Republicans? occasionally, but not often. Most of this film/lecture is on the subject, and it's presented very well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Despite the flaws, this film is a must-see</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It was only a matter of time before someone cranked out a movie about the horrors of global warming. While I half assumed a studio would have greenlit a filthy and clichd script about the unknowing terror every citizen on the planet is facing every day of their lives, I was surprised to see it come in the form of a documentary. A documentary starring almost US President Al Gore of all things. I was intrigued, and so was the rest of the film world. It just took me a little longer to see it.Basically, for all who have yet to discover this documentary, it consists of a huge pile of statistics, stock footage and Al Gore delivering a powerpoint presentation for more than an hour on global warming.While it may bore you at times, the film is beyond thought provoking. Gore and his company of filmmakers have truly created one of the best documentaries of the last decade. The film hits you consistently with hard hitting data on what is exactly happening with global warming, and it never lets up. It terrified me to watch some of the changes certain mountain ranges and bodies of water have gone through in the past thirty years or more. Just watching their gradual change through pictures was enough for me to have to pause the film and take a breather. It is intense, and will downright scare you with how truthful and authentic it is.Gore himself, is something of an anomaly. You would think a politician would be very otherworldly when speaking to a large group of people, and try to show off how much better off he has been. But Gore really is the opposite. He is very down to earth throughout the film, and cracking jokes left and right. Yes, some of them fall flat, but others hit at just the right moments. But you can tell he is an important man, and knows what he is saying is of the most vital importance to anyone watching the film. This guy has a great personality, and he is clearly very dedicated to his humanitarian effort. By making this film, he is trying to reach the greatest number of people possible, and trying to incite them to change. Just listening to his voice rhyme off facts every which way is simply eloquent and masterful. The entire speech is a study in itself in how well prepared and delivered it is.But while the film is well prepared and Gore is right on the money with what he is saying, did the filmmakers not think that giving the audience ideas for what they can do to help the cause was useful? Did they really need to leave it these ideas right until the end of the film, forcing people to sit through the credits trying to understand how to do their part? It strikes me as bizarre. The film really is not all that long, and only drags out very briefly in the middle. They know that they have the audience hooked, and that they will continue watching despite this fact, but they never bother to add in anything other than the hard hitting truth. I wanted to hear Gore tell me what I should do in order to make up for the mistakes of the past. I do not just want to hear him being all negative on what is happening. I want something positive, something useful for me to do. I assume I am not alone in being incited to do something, so why not add it before the credits? Another bizarre thing, which I think took away from the film's hard hitting messages, was the little history lesson on Gore. When we are talking about global warming, is it really significant to show archive footage of his defeat to Bush in the 2000 election? Do we need to know about his tobacco farming days? I never found the use in knowing some of these useless facts, and I really just think they were added in as a bit of padding to help soothe the movie from point A to point B. I am sure they could have added more about his effort to get his message out to the rest of the world, and not just dwell on it for mere seconds before jumping to something that is not important. Hell, they could have added the facts about what we can do to help curb global warming. Would that not have made sense? It is a documentary about global warming after all. It is not about Al Gore. That is the movie he is bound to be putting together now as a result of his immense popularity in Hollywood and around the world.But I think the power that lies deep within the film is in how easily the message of change is brought across, despite its flaws. Yes, he uses some complicated terminology, but it all slowly makes sense. Gore's use of the projector and the many graphs is particularly enlightening, as it really makes it clear what the gravity of the situation is. It also makes the film more simplistic, and easily identifiable. It brings up a lot of moral questions, and is quite a lot of material to digest.But in the end, the film is really just a call to action. Gore demands and begs us to change. And we need to do the same. This documentary is only the first step. I can only hope it will not be the last.8/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Haven't watched a documentary movie for quite a long, but this one can not be missed if u do care about the Earth and has some conscience. Most time the truth is always scary and unacceptable, and we just put too much time immersing ourselves into a world without worrying about these stuff because we deliberately choose to be isolated from the messages even we hear them from time to time, how the environment has worsened, we still have a naive imagination everything will be fine eventually instead of doing something.Only the braves will face the problem and try to solve it, and it needs a lot of effort and courage. We may feel nail-biting and try to do some change but the motivation is always ephemeral and then again we will be occupied with other stuffs, gradually we forget the motivation and back to the original state. That is the exact situation of me! Single person's willpower is easily broken, so the more people aware of this more effort we can make to change the environment and make the Earth a better place to live.I have no interest in politics, thus I barely have no impression of Al Gore, but his speech is convincing and powerful, really a politician! And was also very funny in this year's Oscar awards ceremony, congratulate for winning the Best Documentary and Melissa Etheridge's winning for the original song "I Need To Wake Up". She's a charming and brave woman and this song rocks!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You'll never read the weather page the same way again</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Discussing the weather used to be a reliable way of making small talk. After all, everyone had an opinion on the weather, but it wasn't the kind of thing that provoked controversy and argument, either. That all seems to have changed within the last year or so: now, if you mention that the weather is unusual, the conversation will immediately turn to global warming. And much of the credit for this, I think, has to go to Al Gore's global-warming expos, "An Inconvenient Truth." It's an eye-opening, well-reasoned documentary (much less snarky than something like "Fahrenheit 9/11") that already seems to have had a major cultural impact. Still, if you haven't seen this movie yet, you should; the more impact this makes, the better.The movie is just Gore's global-warming lecture (he modestly refers to it as "the slide show," but it does have some snazzy computer graphics), interspersed with passages where Gore takes a more reflective tone. Gore's presentation is expertly timed, occasionally humorous, always earnest without lapsing into a politician's phony sincerity. But of course, the statistics and images?the graphs of carbon-dioxide content in the atmosphere, the photos of vanishing glaciers?are shocking enough to speak for themselves.I think the movie could have been even more effective, though, if it put more emphasis on what people can do to solve this problem. After being barraged with alarming statistics for an hour and a half, it's easy to feel helpless, and to want to beg if there's any way to avert catastrophe. So at the end of the movie, Gore lists changes that, combined, would cut our carbon emissions to pre-1970 levels, and interspersed with the end credits are additional suggestions of things to do. But coming at the end of the movie like this, it feels like a perfunctory palliative, rather than true hope and reassurance. (For one thing, Gore mentions that humans have already repaired the hole in the ozone layer, which recent evidence shows not to be true.) Also, Gore is such an engaging lecturer that it would be easier to remember the suggestions if we saw and heard him discuss them, rather than reading them during the end credits.So, because these things can't be said too often, I'll repeat them one more time: Hybrid cars, public transit, bicycles, walking. Turning down your thermostat and turning off your air conditioning. Planting trees. Buying fewer disposable plastic items. Agitating for the US to finally sign the Kyoto Protocol. Seeing this movie, and dragging all your skeptical friends along with you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Inescapable Truth</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw "An Inconvenient Truth" on DVD the other night. In that documentary, Al Gore argues two cases. One well, and the other... not so much.The talented film crew (see "The Making of..." in the DVD's extra features) provided a truly impressive communications capability to Gore, for him to sell something that shouldn't and wouldn't need that much salesmanship, if we had a society with a government capable of making reasoned based decisions. Not having such, this film is an important means of communicating what is most definitely a message of existential importance, which I will phrase a bit more forcefully than Gore: If we don't stop what we have been doing to kill the planet, the planet will kill us.Gore's second argument appeared to be his primary motivation: His not so well done attempt to subliminally convince viewers that he is our hope, the lone ranger political Messiah, who will save the planet, and us with it. Both his action and in-action, when he was the "Environmental Vice-President" serve to negate his clumsy political self-advertisement attempt. He claims to have given his "Inconvenient Truth" lecture "a thousand times." He didn't give it on primetime TV, from the Naval Observatory (Vice-President's residence). He didn't give it in Kyoto. When he was empowered, he didn't serve the good.Some have criticized the smallness of the little things artfully suggested in the documentary's closing credits, which individuals might do to make themselves a little less a part of the problem of Global Warming. However, the inescapable truth is that those in power -- whether red or blue -- will continue to destroy the planet, and the only serious counterbalance will be the little things we little people will do.What Clinton-Gore proved beyond any reasonable doubt is that, in the very best light -- the most polite characterization -- the more "electable" of the two electoral non-choices provided by corporate entities, in their elections of deception, will do what should not be done, and will not do what should be done.In November of 2008, I will not be pulling a top lever for a white man, a black man, or a white woman, of which none of whom will have any intent to do good with power. The sociopathic and malevolent non-human entities which own all of them would never allow anyone of them, that might have good intentions, to advance beyond a major party primary. I won't be voting red or blue, white or black. I will be voting Green. And if there is no Green candidate for POTUS, then my vote will be counted among one of the Board of Elections' euphemisms for votes cast for "None of the Above" (Blank, Scattered, Void).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>First film to impact natural history of the planet</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Al Gore's tireless campaign to educate the whole world about its own imminent climate chaos. Objectively this is the most important film of the year, since it could have an impact not merely on history, but also on the natural history (AKA "evolution") of this planet. How many films can you say that about? I gave discount tickets to all of my college students, from frosh to grads. Out of 95 students, more than half did go to see it. The rest worried that it would be too boring, and it's not their business. About half of those who saw it were very impressed, because they _hadn't realized any of this before_! This is precisely why the film needed to be made and why people need to see it: they aren't reading the daily news. And what news they do read is so fragmentary, rushed, and contradictory that they don't get enough from it. This week, the UK decided to show the film in every public school around the country. My students were also surprised that the film isn't boring. Gore's warnings are on the modest end of the range of scientific predictions. Since the film was released, we're being told again by yet another huge study that climate change is coming faster and greater than was predicted last year.P.S. 8/2007. Over a year later, it is interesting to note that the film is gaining attention rather than losing it. This is perhaps due to the fact that climate change is now in the news daily around the world: drought in Australia, floods in England, heat deaths in Greece, polar bears drowning (real ones this year, not the animated ones in Gore's film) and that even the average numbskull can look around them and feel the effects even if they failed to grasp the stats. The last few remaining scientific skeptics have now faced up to the overwhelming consensus arriving from hundreds of studies. The rest is silence.</fullReview>

This is a highly informative presentation piece that should really be required viewing, while moderator and recent Nobel Prize Nominee Al Gore demonstrates a welcomed charisma. However, the lecture is oddly inter-cut with artsy segments exploring Mr. Gore's personal battles in life, which leads the doc in a more political direction, and can actually defeat its own purpose by turning away the conservative base and preaching to its own choir instead. Why haven't liberals learned to make a bi-partisan film yet? Then they might be taken seriously. Nevertheless, the point is clear? Manwithavan may soon be Manwithabike.

		<fullReview>This movie was very very well put together. I think that people need to know these things about Global Warming. I also think that Al Gore should be president. George Bush is an idiot. If Gore was president, there would be no war in Iraq. There is no point for the war and it is very stupid. Al Gore is an intelligent genius man who needs more recognition for what he is trying to do for this planet. I think that it is a stunning documentary, and Al Gore presents himself very well. I need to fill the other three lines of this comment. this is Darren. I love Nirvana. Kurt Cobain was murdered. loll. Any body who has actually seen this movie and likes it. Has very good good taste. It is a brilliant movie that needs to be seen by everyone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Despite I am a proud republican, I think this is a great movie. Don't get blind before Gore only because he's a democratic guy, what he's explaining is pure "truth", scientifically proved. More people must be aware of this REAL problem and act quickly! Be part of the solution and not of the problem, I am a proud American and proud America produced such a movie. And since I believe so strong in my country and people, I think we can change this stupid way we keep running. I hate to be known as the second bigger polluter in the world after Australia, that's really a shame and we can't ignore it. If you ignore it, you don't love enough your country and your world.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>We've seen the movie and was completely moved. As farmers in the Midwest and in the Breadbasket we are concerned about our Mother Earth. Everything we do effects our ecosystem and our planet. Most people try and pitch in and help our planet by recycling, riding a bike or walk to work or school, use renewable resources that agricultural products provide, but there is much more we can do. With all the emissions and smog released in our atmosphere from all means of transportation on the highways and byways today we can stop all of this. Yes, by purchasing hybrid vehicles, but those vehicles need to be recharged,using electricity. I know how to recharge these vehicles, without electricity, for FREE! Not costing anyone or the United States a dime for oil, and depending on other foreign countries for our oil supplies or tapping into our reserve. If interested, Mr Al Gore, on how we can do this contact me and I would be happy to explain it to you and show you how it can be done.Thank you for the eye opener! We liked the movie and have shared it with others. We think the whole world should see this movie. Keep us informed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Al Gore's Presentation or "An Inconvenient Truth"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Al Gore comes across well in this movie. The presentation is not new but is, as would be expected, now a polished performance, with a liberal sprinkling of humour,and the human touch, that insight into the man, his upbringing and his values.The comparison with JW Bush is unavoidable but he doesn't overplay this, merely leaves the viewer to draw his own conclusions about the present administration and the ignorance and misinformation which prevails there.The camera footage is excellent and the visual aids superb. There were few surprises in the message for me. I do not share his optimism for a tidal change in environmental issues but at least its a start and good to see that the NE states and CA are getting behind him.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I liked the movie and the subject matter was great however there is a serious misrepresentation of fact on the DVD special feature section when AL Gore gives a one year update. AL Gore says that 70 million tones of carbon dioxide are emitted in the US daily, but the real number is more around 16 million tones daily per the US DOE. I'm sure this was an oversight of some kind, but in the interest of factual integrity it should be noted. I have been in the environmental business for a while and have been doing a lot of research on global warming and climate change. Also the reference to greenhouse gases as "global warming gases" is also kind of discrediting to the film among us in the business. I applaud the Vice Presdients efforts and he is undertaking in a great cause and there is no doubt that we all have to act collectively. .</fullReview>

Obviously you don't want to believe your lying eyes as the 10,000 year old Larsen B ice shelf slides into the sea.In conclusion, to modify the Upton Sinclair quote in the film: "You can't make a man understand something when his lifestyle depends on him not understanding it".For the rest of us, this film is essential viewing.</fullReview>

It is very similar to the way a reporter/anchor who reports on Bush or anything that is inconvenient gets fired. Fired because he let the cat out of the bag, and had to resign. Free Speech was the American way, and that is very sad.Maybe some of the information in this documentary is not totally backed up, the essence of this documentary is important and should be viewed by all. It is far more correct then the BS story that Bush told to get into Iraq and that we do teach in the schools. FAIR and BALANCED? I do not think so.....</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'll freely admit that I didn't know much about Al Gore before I watched this. I have heard about global warming, and it is a subject that worries me. From I first heard of this, I wanted to watch it. Whilst the basic idea may sound dull... it can, with some truth, be described as a film of Gore showing a Power Point presentation. Granted, this is hardly an eventful piece; there is little action and few developments. This is not a Michael Moore film; we aren't bombarded with facts of varying degrees of truth, with a humorous, if smarmy, commentary. Al Gore calmly describes the problem, the misconceptions regarding it... and most importantly, the solutions. Yes, it is idealistic and it has an agenda... but it does not talk down to its audience, and the moral is one of world-wide interest. Gore has great charisma, and clearly believes very passionately in his cause. With fact-based argumentation, he describes many of the effects that the green-house effect may have, if we don't prevent it. There is even a small amount of humor, delivered perfectly, which doesn't detract or distract from the serious nature of the subject. There is almost no political content herein; it is focused on the issue, which, as Gore points out, is a moral one. The editing and cinematography are subtle, and it feels more like simply watching Gore have the speech, attending his presentation. The credits roll as numerous pieces of advice on how to help, through simple, everyday actions appear on the screen, and rather than claiming that the battle is impossible to win, as so many who oppose the fight have, he ends the feature with naming the ways we can alter our lives to keep Earth around. Remarkable documentary, very worth watching. I recommend this to any fan of documentaries and anyone who has an opinion on this subject at all... whether or not you agree with Mr. Gore. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Most important film of the decade!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Here it is May, and I know there will be no more important film of 2006 than the Al Gore doc "An Inconvenient Truth". This film WILL drastically change the political and environmental consciousness of our country, and carve itself a mark in National history. This perfection in cinema will be immortalized for posterity, and emerge as the preeminent example of our medium's power of education and influence. When the lights came up, I made for the door. The entire audience stayed for the credits, but I instantly wanted to be alone. My reactions had been emotional and it was painful stifling my welling elation. Three young girls (sixteen to eighteen, at the most) filed out of the cinema in front of me. One sniffled restraint over her own reaction, as they pushed open the heavy wooden doors and squinted into the light. "I trading my car in tomorrow," she proclaimed. "Tsssst, come on!" her friend jeered. No doubt, the group's eternal skeptic and future anachronism. "I don't care what you say. I'm doing it!" she persisted. The skeptic piped down and the three solemnly exited the structure. I have never had so much optimism for our future, youth, and culture.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>See this film before you comment. It isn't hurting anyone.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have read a lot of the negative comments on IMDb about an Inconventiant Truth, which is one of my favorite movies. I will keep this really short. Don't say this movie is a push for Al Gore's political campaign because he started giving this presentation with his professor right out of college around 30 years ago. View this as just a "taping" of a presentation he has been giving most of his life. I believe in Global Warming, and I respect the fact that their are people in the world who do not, and there may always be; however, this movie isn't hurting anyone. So do not get defensive, scared, or worried that you will feel obligated to begin fighting global warming. You don't have to do anything. You don't even have to recycle if you want. This movie is not trying to make you feel guilty, just aware. This movie is also not trying to give you "homework" so don't feel obligated to make a change. Lastly, I can't understand why anyone would have a problem with a film that isn't hurting anyone. Reducing green house gases, and cleaning up the environment is something we need to do REGARDLESS. I don't care if you don't believe it, because its true. This is our planet and we should take care of it. I know many people don't believe what I am going to say next, and they will probably hold it against me if they respond to this message. BUT I PERSONALLY find Al Gore as one of the heroes of our generation, and electing Bush instead may have been one of our greatest trageties. It hurts me to see people leave terrible comments about this film.Just ask yourself: What kind of world do we live in if we want to bash and condemn someone who tries to make it a better place.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Normally, a film featuring a politician discussing a subject he really cares for wouldn't be that interesting, especially if most of the movie consists of a Power Point slide-show being shown to a live audience. But then again, Al Gore isn't an average politician, and the environment and our planet's climate aren't average topics, which is why An Inconvenient Truth, justly awarded two Oscars, stands as one of the most powerful documentaries in recent history.Gore, we learn, has been concerned about the issue of global warming since college, and started doing research while he entered politics. The results of that research are shown under the form of graphs, which Gore showed to the public during a tour that covered almost all of the USA and Europe, and, frankly, what he has discovered in thirty years is unsettling: within five decades, our world could change irreversibly, as the North and South Pole have already started to melt, pollution is still causing trouble, and catastrophes like Hurricane Katrina seem to be linked to the increasing rise of the world's temperature (most alarmingly, the ten hottest years ever all occurred between 1990 and 2004: accidental? Don't think so). If a solution isn't found, we might end up in a scenario similar to The Day After Tomorrow (which is featured briefly in the movie).Gore's charisma and methods ensure An Inconvenient Truth never feels like a tiresome lecture: despite the serious subject matter, he manages to successfully use humor and irony to convey his message (the use of a Futurama episode to explain what causes global warming is the best example). He even finds time to quickly comment on what happened to him during the 2000 presidential election, by introducing himself with the phrase "I'm Al Gore, I used to be the next President of the United States of America", and then adding "I don't find that particularly funny" when the audience starts to laugh. In fact, his statements about our planet's problems are delivered with such accuracy and straightness it's hard not to wonder what America would be like now, had things taken a different turn. Unlike others, Gore knows what he's talking about and has solid evidence to back it up. Any doubts the public ever had about Earth's most significant environmental concern should be wiped out, the leading man providing all the answers without ever making the film boring, courtesy of alternating his exposition of the facts with anecdotes regarding his family, which give further insight on why he became so determined to let the world know the truth, no matter how inconvenient (rarely has a title been more apt) or shocking it may be.With all the hype it has generated, it's likely An Inconvenient Truth will prompt people to start looking for solutions to the global warming problem. And therein, as a matter of fact, lies the movie's biggest problem: after an hour and a half of quite depressing news, the only suggestions of what to do are inserted as captions between one credit and another in the closing sequence. Shame the average moviegoer will have left the theater or turned off the TV by then, thus missing the opportunity to help. Had Gore and director Davis Guggenheim been a little more careful with the last part, they could have delivered a perfect piece of powerful cinema. The flawed conclusion, however, doesn't diminish the impact of the rest of the film which, for once, is something EVERYBODY should see, and I really mean it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>There are no such things as ethical dilemmas; only unwanted solutions.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The title reminds me of something my dad always taught in his Ethics class: There are no such things as ethical dilemmas; only unwanted solutions.I've always wanted to watch this docu, and so I was really glad that our company (Ayala Land, Inc.) gave us the chance to see it for free. Having us view it during office hours drove home the point that the company means it when it says Corporate Social Responsibility is part of our business. Re: the docu, it wasn't boring at all. The introspective shots and flashbacks to Gore's own personal life were indulgent but you allow him this because you can't help but admire his tenacity yet feel his frustration. I like how he punctuates the serious mood with his droll humor:Al Gore: I'm Al Gore, I used to be the next president of the United States of America. (laughter and applause from audience) Al Gore: I don't find that particularly funny. In a way, An Inconvenient Truth was like The Pursuit of Happiness; seeing Gore lug around his laptop and preaching to a tough-sell audience all over the globe is a daunting task indeed, much like Will Smith's character in The Pursuit of Happiness who was lugging around and selling heavy bone density scanners to doctors who didn't see the need for it yet.The US and the world would have been very different had Gore won vs. Bush in the presidential elections. We probably wouldn't have had as much oil-related problems. But what's admirable is Gore just keeps on chugging along, never mind if he's not the president. The sad thing about most well-meaning environmentalists is that they come across as all doom-and-gloom and become really boring holier-than-thous. But Gore is able to use his political nature to rouse and convince and hold people's attention; hopefully, we all will listen and actually do something about it before it's too late. Losing should not be an option, as this is one battle where we should all be on the same side.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought this was quite a neat piece of advocacy ? the charts and graphs and glossy photographs were very impressive. I didn't mind the personal stuff ?it helped explain why he is campaigning so hard.I was interested in Al's assertion that if the Gulf Stream "pump" stopped working because of the rapid collapse of the Greenland Ice Shelf we would have a climatic catastrophe such as the one portrayed in "The Day After Tomorrow" though he did not spell out exactly how fast it would occur (or refer to the movie). Geological events, apart from meteor impacts, volcanic eruptions and earthquakes, tend to occur slowly. "A thousand ages in thy sight is like an evening gone." Ice ages take a while to come and go, and the effects of global warming have taken several centuries to be felt. So I wondered whether there was a little scaremongering going on here, no doubt for the very best of motives.The other thing I wondered about was remedial action. Al was surprisingly light on this, considering this is now the issue. Even a sceptic like me has to admit the prudent course is to take action, for as the titled English economist pointed out, the cost of taking no action is likely to be much greater. The need for modification of one's own extravagant lifestyle (in CO2 production terms) was rather understated, yet both industrial and personal action is required. Al mentions the Kyoto protocol, but clearly China and India have to sign up for it to be effective.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a dramatic actor Al Gore is no Lawrence Olivier. And as an inspirational speaker he's no Billy Graham. And he's not especially photogenic. To be perfectly honest, he has only three main virtues on display in this documentary. (1) He speaks slowly and clearly, even at his most hortatory. (2) He's obviously got brains. (3) He's got vision.Mostly this is his filmed lecture, the one he's been giving around the country and abroad. There's a good deal of graphics that illustrate in a simple way some of the more complicated statistical points he's making, and lots of easy-to-read maps. The text of the lecture is straightforward with no more than a minimal amount of scientific jargon. It has few jokes. And it bashes no one openly so that, unlike, say, Rush Limbaugh or Keith Olbermann or Hannity and O'Reilly, the presentation handicaps itself by not being able to cash in on collective anger. His counterpart would be more like George F. Will, except that this particular social problem is neither liberal nor conservative in its properties. The emotions elicited are not rage and not adulation for the speaker, but awe at the magnitude of the problem being addressed and anxiety over the possibility that it may not be addressed at all.The guy really believes that global warming is underway and that it is in fact increasing and that we are among the leading contributors. Well, he's convinced me. Not that it took much convincing. A year or so ago, having read so often than global warming was "a theory" and that it was "controversial," I went to the bother of looking up some of the research that is repeatedly cited to refute global warming. I'm not a climatologist but I have spent thirty years in research and I know how the machine works. In reading the contrary research reports on global warming I was really surprised. Even in my own field, behavioral science, I've never seen such openly corrupt research taken seriously. Here's one technique that's used in the contrary studies, often funded by the American Petroleum Institute, to refute global warming. Find an exception to the rule and publish it as if it disproves the rule. In my own field, this would be as absurd as challenging the generalization that all people speak languages by finding someone who is mute and publishing a case study. Thus, "all people speak" can become only "a theory" or a "controversial" idea.Should it have won an Oscar? I don't know. It's competently done, the issue is of manifest importance, and the emotional tone is restrained and civilized. It's not innovative in the way that Errol Morris was or is, but, yes, it's pretty well done. I don't know what the other contenders were like. The only genuine problem with the film that I could find was a dumbed-down gumbaya type of folk song, "I've Gotta Wake Up," played under the end credits.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Scary Wake Up Call for Those Still Napping</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The only people who will watch "An Inconvenient Truth" will be those who need no convincing that global warming may just be the single most pressing issue affecting modern man -- yes, even more pressing than the war on terror. As much as jihadists would probably like to think otherwise, radical Islam just can't compete with annihilation of the entire planet.Consisting almost entirely of filmed footage of a fancy slide show presentation Al Gore presents around the world to various groups, "An Inconvenient Truth" lays out a formidable array of statistics to prove the validity of global warming and its effects on the environment, and makes it painfully clear (if it wasn't already) that those who still and inexplicably refuse to consider its reality are ostriches with their heads hopelessly buried. The film's title is a perfect one; those who dismiss global warming as the apparition of liberal scare mongers don't want to admit of its existence because it would be awfully inconvenient for them to. Inconvenient for governments because, as Gore says, they would then have a moral imperative to do something about it. Inconvenient for individual citizens because they would have to make some changes to their lifestyles that would cause them to give up minor conveniences.Moments of the film are deeply scary, like the one when Gore explains what will happen when and if a chunk of Antarctica or Greenland breaks off, elevating the sea level worldwide by 20 feet, drowning Manhattan and most of Florida, and submerging humongous cities like Shanghai in China and Bangalore in India, homes to millions of people. The United States couldn't even deal with a flooded city like New Orleans; what will it do when Los Angeles and San Francisco become disaster areas?Luckily, "An Inconvenient Truth" ends on a hopeful note, suggesting that the challenge our planet faces due to global warming is not insurmountable, and that the human race has been able to reverse seemingly irreversible problems in the past (like the hole in the ozone layer). More importantly, it explains what the average citizen like you and me can do to make ourselves feel a little less helpless. Let's hope that the call to action is not only heard but understood by those who need to understand it most.Grade: A</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this documentary only a couple of days ago after buying it on DVD. Due to its overwhelmingly positive publicity, I've already had an inking on what it's about and what it covers, but seeing the film itself has totally opened my mind and left me stunned. First of all, its replaced "Fog of War" as my favourite documentary. Secondly, I see now that there is a definite difference between reading about global warming and the supporting evidence in a newspaper article or editorial crammed onto page 10 compared to actually seeing the facts laid out graphically on screen in front of you. It is not because most people are unable to read or understand, but because visual aides always work better to enhance memory and full comprehension.This film and the included slide show contains a serious message, one that ex-Vice President Al Gore delivers perfectly. His arguments for bigger action on global warming are succinct, persuasive and supported by scientific fact. Occasionally laced with witty humour and full of enthusiasm, this film not only lays bare the overwhelming scientific evidence pointing to global warming being a real issue, but also presents it as moral issue as well as (or rather than) a political issue. Gore urges against a partisan attitude towards global warming, pushing instead for a global effort to prevent the destruction of the third planet from the sun. Seeing this movie made me want to get up, to go out there, and fight alongside Gore and thousands of other environmentalists for our planet's future and the future of our children and the generations to come. I would seriously recommend "An Inconvenient Truth" to everyone. No matter what your age, political affiliation, religion, upbringing or beliefs are, you should go see this movie.

How can we turn a blind eye to the destruction of our planet, our home? This is a jaw dropping investigation into how our planet has changed, and how we,as a generation, have destroyed parts of our world essential to the balance of life and survival on our planet. Educate your friends, family, children now... show them this film and take steps to begin to reverse this destructive pattern before it's too late... it's your home, we all have a responsibility.Unlike the political agendas of others, Gore does not pander to the audience about his own agenda. He is passionate, educated and knowledgeable without claiming to have a scientific 'truth' - he merely presents the facts which are both undeniable and frightening. we must bad together on this issue. Recycling, reducing carbon emissions and collective responsibility are a few of the many methods which will help to reverse these damages.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film of course is a very important one - for the United States....not so much for places like the EU or Japan. Since they have been establishing tough (but more than justified rules) concerning the preservation of nature, the USA have not by any means met standards that are worth of a major industrialized society. I was shocked to see that in the USA there is in fact a discussion whether global warming is a true phenomenon or rather an urban legend of the "radical environmentalists and the radical left". But the film itself was not entirely convincing. The first thing that bothered me about it was a chart that showed the increase of CO2 emission over a certain time (i don't remember exactly which period was covered, but it's of no importance right now). The thing was: there were no units on either axis! So the chart can be stretched and formed however wished. While I believe that the issue of global warming is a very urgent and true one, it does not help to work with semi-scientific data! The other thing was that Al Gore quoted "a friend of mine", or "my friend" quite often. If i get any quotes I'd like to know by whom. It would have been better to actually name them. The same thing happened with "2 major studies". Instead of just calling them studies he should have named them. The best solution (which also would not have interrupted his speech) would have been to just show the name of the scientist and the information on his study in the corner of the screen so that interested persons can actually get additional information on his resources.But, and that I must say: Thanks to Al Gore for finally trying to get the US society to get information on the catastrophe we are all heading at if we don't act to preserve the earth!Finally: have you seen the propaganda-videos of the oil-lobby which is actually propagating the increase of CO2? Just google for "They call it pollution. We call it life." or search for "Global Warming" on youtube. Videos made and distributed by "CEI.org". If it weren't so incredibly irresponsible it would be really funny!</fullReview>

American politician Al Gore was a student of Professor Roger Revelle, one of the first scientists to study this phenomena, when he attended Harvard, and soon became a constant advocate of environmentalist causes as he considered the results of Revelle's investigations a frightening prediction. Now, almost 50 years after Professor Revelle's initial discoveries, global warming seems to have worked the way Revelle theorized and the consequences begin to be noticed. This is the initial premise of "An Inconvenient Truth", a documentary about global warming starring Revelle's former student Al Gore where the intention is to show his views on this debate, in an attempt to convince Global Warming skeptics that this problem is a reality."An Inconvenient Truth" is essentially the film version of Al Gore's slide show presentation that he has given in many of his conferences across the world. In this presentation, Gore goes on explaining what is global warming, it's effects on our environment, and the possibly negative consequences it will have if mankind does not reduce the amount of human-generated greenhouse gases in the future. In the presentation, Gore also talks about the economics and politics surrounding the heated global warming debate focusing mainly on the U.S. politics on the subject. With the aid of animations, charts and Gore's personal life anecdotes, the makers of "An Inconvenient Truth" attempts to offer a clear description of the problem and their suggestions on how to solve it.The film was directed by Davis Guggenheim, who even when is probably better known as a director of famous TV series like "Party of Five" and "Deadwood" among others, makes a very good job at making Gore's slide show presentation work properly as a documentary film. Guggenheim's restrained direction keeps the film's message as the main focus without adding too much visual flare that could be distracting. However, his very effective work of edition makes sure that the movie moves smoothly and at a nice pace, something really important in this kind of films. While Guggenheim's documentary lacks the personal style that Michael Moore and Morgan Spurlock gave to theirs (movies that have been compared to this one), the movie never gets boring or tedious, and manage to deliver Gore's message without distractions or obstacles.While not visually impressive, the power of the film is on the words of Al Gore. A skilled orator, Gore delivers his message with confidence and charm, giving enough time to explain every point he touches during the presentation. One could think that a film revolving around a conference would be boring, but Gore makes sure that his message is delivered in a simple, clear, and at times entertaining way; it's a serious and important message, but he knows his audience and is willing to make the learning process a pleasing experience. Additionally to the conference, the film includes Gore's meditations about the problem and some personal stories that helped him to decide to be an environmentalist. It's probably in this additions where the film tends to lose some force, as often they feel as unnecessary, and politically convenient for Gore's career.This kind of flaws is what lessens the power of "An Inconvenient Truth" as a tool of scientific teaching, as while for the most part Gore takes an apolitical stance, there are some moments where the film seems to be a political attack to the Republican administration instead of a socially conscious documentary. Now, please note that this in no way lessens the value of Gore's message or his intentions, but it comes up as an odd and, as written above, unnecessary inclusion; as even when the problem indeed has political undertones, they could had been handled them in a subtler way. However, it's worth to point out that the way Gore handles the scientific data is remarkably honest and the science used as basis for the film is accurate and presented in an unbiased light.It could be easy to dismiss "An Inconvenient Truth" as propaganda, specially if one is not completely on agreement with its ideology; however, it is an important film, because not only it is about global warning in general, it is about the conservation of our planet, and about taking the responsibility to protect it, as it is in the end our only home. It doesn't matter if one agrees or not with Gore's politic ideas, this movie is definitely a must see for its scientific and social content. A great and very noble effort. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disturbing, on many levels</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film is very much worth seeing, it addresses a very important issue, and gives people at least one side, presented very intelligently with a great amount of detail.Al Gore has a pleasant demeanor, and an appropriate level of humor to keep it interesting - he's a funny guy when he wants to be.It convinced me that this is an important, issue that needs to be dealt with, regardless of one's politics.Nonetheless, the implementation of a solution would be very political, and he does have a track record, most notably Vice President of the United States from 1993-2001. (I voted for him 1996). I don't see how you can discuss the implementation of a resolution realistically, without considering the fact that he was Vice President, and what example did he set with his actions then, vs his words now. It's very relevant to this movie and issue. According to the movie, he's been aware of Global Warming since he was in college.During his administration, Globalism advanced more rapidly than ever. Gore even debated Ross Perot in favor of NAFTA. Why push so much manufacturing outside of our jurisdiction of our regulations (and control) of the United States, if such large change in the way of doing things is needed? A large number of Americans, perhaps the majority did not want NAFTA.His administration, was also the era of the 'sport utility vehicle', a vehicle exempt from mileage standards. More of them were made in 93-2001 than ever. I recall it as the era where the energy conservation ethic in motor vehicles completely collapsed.His administration also passed MFN-China, again, enormous amount of manufacturing outside of our jurisdiction and control, and it sure as heck didn't help American workers.His administration is also the era where the computer industry was pulled out of the hands of the Americans who built it, and sent to India.The building up of both India and Chinese middle class, without any improvement whatsoever in the carbon footprint of the average middle class person, greatly aggravate the problem, as automobile use in India and China exploded - all the while at the expense of the American worker, as fuel demand increased gas prices as their jobs were lost.Last but not least, immigration into the United States exploded during 1993-2001. Far more pressure of our polluting infrastructure, again, at the expense of working Americans. How do we begin to communicate compliance of new rules to immigrants who don't speak our language, and in many cases began their life here breaking the rules?All of the points above, make me very concerned about the possibility of solving this, if he is in fact on the level about the seriousness of this, which I think he is. With the exception of controlling freon, which did help, it seems like everything else his administration did hurt this cause AND was against the will of the American people he's now lecturing to!! How does he expect us to change this and future administrations, when he couldn't control his own from the inside? Something to think about, next time he takes a long drive in his full size Cadillac.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Looking to my dark thoughts I can't help but feel that Al Gore is delivering the "Sermon on the Mount" and how can we not buy into it at least because the facts that are delivered are hard to dispute. I think Al Gore not only is convincing but he is the guy that should have been running this country these last two plus years. There, I said it. Just what a lot of us have been thinking. I just can't help but wonder what if this movie had come out b/4 the election? Bush would have been unemployed (just kidding). What is so obvious about this particular documentary is it was so timely after Katrina. We saw how Bush and company botched it and dropped the ball into the Mississippi. I have to say it. Al should have had his shot. We'll never know but will continue to say ...what if?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gore provides all the information we as inhabitants of the Earth need to know about the cause and effect of global warming. This was basically a taping of his seminar he gives on stage around the world, with a few added scenes and pictures. I have read his book "Ecology and the human spirit" and now have seen the film "An Inconvenient truth" and I have to say he is the most passionate person I have ever seen concerning the status of the Earth environmentally. When you see the stats and figures of his collective findings it's hard to believe republican politicians that say that global warming is just a big joke and that it's nothing to worry about.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie is an excellent attempt to sensitize people about Global warming. Al Gore's acting is superb. He uses simple language to make understand the complex problem in a simple manner. His own history helps him see what others seem to be rather oblivious if not resistant. The movie is very well edited and kept the audience in mind rather than making it any other science fiction movie. Global warming is not just an environmental issue, but also a political moral and spiritual issue. The title of the movie is very appropriate because developing countries around the world still don't pay attention to limit pollution of poisonous gases that destroy the ozone layer and causing severer climate changes. Al Gore presents abundance of scientific research and data, and really proves that the situation is quite worrisome and requires fast and determinate actions. The sound track by Melissa Etheridge is awesome and really seeps down in soul. The movie is not boring at any point. All I want to say that it's a "MUST WATCH". The promotion of the movie is still very limited. A campaign must be initiated in which free DVDs should be sent to universities, NGOs, Government Institutions not in US but other countries especially developing countries so the message reaches around the globe. I am sure the movie can make a difference people would take a notice at their consumption trends.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I put this on in the video store the other day expecting to get a little scared. Unfortunately this movie did more. I'm now spreading the word. Well kind of.Al Gore some how puts comedy in the extremely serious situation. That is global warming. Before I laughed at the idea of global warming but now I fear it. This movie tells what no one wanted to tell you. The message is, "If we don't act now, than we won't make it much longer."The film was very well done. It gave you breaks after inhaling all the disturbing statistics than went off on something else like Al Gore's childhood life, vice president term, son, etc. Gore isn't the most fun to listen too but he does present the information well. I recently thought the movie HARD CANDY was the most disturbing movie I've seen in a while; now this PG movie disturbs me more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Powerful information dryly conveyed may alienate some viewers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This latest environmental warning of a documentary stands out as perhaps the most grave and clearly argued of them all, though not without it's setbacks. As we are led through former Vice President Al Gore's global warming power-point lecture, it does become painfully obvious that the documentary is merely the heightened classroom speech that Gore has been giving around the world ever since his bid to become the next president had been crushed with a veil of controversy back in 2000. While this admirable man had been interested in the global warming phenomena decades before his rise into power after his unfortunate and stinging loss to Bush during the Florida voting outrage, Gore retreated from the spotlight and quietly continued to pursue one of his biggest passions-preserving the integrity of our environment. Make no mistake; the facts, projections, comparisons, and expertise are all carefully laid out in typical Gore (slow and informed) fashion to present the argument for cleaner, wiser living for the planet's well being beyond the shadow of all rational doubt. The amount of empirical data and side by side comparisons of former glacier hot-spots will leave few skeptics with much ammunition to argue the contrary. However, it is those skeptics, and the majority of casual moviegoers, I fear will not even be open to receive the profoundly important message Gore and company are putting out there, simply due to the documentary's stilted, fact-based tedium. Aside from a few personal and humorous touches, An Inconvenient Truth is essentially a glorified 1 1/2 hour lecture, and despite the information being some of the most concise pro-environmental arguments being made for our public to come to terms with, the movie simply does not make itself accessible to enough of an audience to promote the beautiful, clean, world-wide agenda it so nobly pursues.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What was most surprising to me after seeing An Inconvenient Truth was that the movie was not necessarily a movie about the problem of global warming but a movie about Al Gore's slide show presentation and his effort to inform the world. Through the clips of his presentation the overall message is clear, that if we don't change certain things global warming will have a devastating effect on the world. That is a very important issue that I think should be brought to everyone's attention, at the end of the movie they give a website to find out how you can reduce carbon dioxide emissions and such but this is during the credits. An hour into the film I was thinking to myself that so far the movie had only shown how bad the circumstances of global warming will be, not until maybe the last 15 minutes are any solutions offered. This movie has been promoted as a wake up call of sorts to the nation but after watching it I felt more like it was a look at what Al Gore is doing. This personally doesn't bother me, I enjoyed it throughly, however I think many people would be turned away from the movie just because it is so political and not just scientific. There are several instances Vice President Gore jokes about how he was supposed to be president and takes shots at the current administration which unfortunately may turn away some people. I just felt like if this is such an important issue why not make the information available to the largest group of people possible? Instead of running it in limited release where the average person has to seek the movie out why not air it on at least a cable station? Politics aside the movie does what it does very well. It explains about Gore's past and explains why he is so passionate about his cause. The movie does provide lots of eye opening information on what global warming is doing and what may happen but manages to still be light hearted too. At one point when he is showing a graph the line of data went so high that he got on a crane device to reach it which added humor to a serious topic. There was an animated clip shown which I recognized the animation as looking like "The Simpson's" and found out it actually was from the creator of that show's other series "Futurama". These type of things kept the film from feeling too serious. Some things were brought up that I think they should have gone more into if they were going to scratch the surface, specifically conspiracy theory type claims that the Bush administration has altered or kept information from the public about global warming. The few things that were shown were convincing and if they are true they deserve a movie about them on their own.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thought &amp; action provoking documentary on Global Warming</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was a fascinating documentary on Global Warming presented by Al Gore. It is the most engaging documentary I have seen, in the same league as "Bowling for Columbine". It was factual without being patronizing and has provoked my family into action. We were already more environmentally sensitive than most of our neighbours and have taken it up a notch. I am an Australian citizen and was disgusted to learn that Australia has not signed the Kyoto agreement and have since joined lobby groups to pressure our government into doing so.It is worth seeing whether you are a believer or a skeptic or somewhere in between. Do your own research afterwards to confirm the facts. This is no "Da Vinci Code" with theories based on theories and masquerading as fact. Good for all ages from 12 years.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>aside from an occasional wisecrack from Al Gore, this documentary was really quite serious and scary. Basically, Gore discusses the dangers that global warming presents to the world and the dramatic climate change that will occur if we don't work together globally to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The documentary proved effective in creating a fear factor out of the global warming issue (if it hadn't been before) while also remaining as politically neutral as possible. Still, I thought Gore talked too much about his personal life and his presidential bid in 2000 although he did tie them into the general theme of the film. This movie further validates the theory of global warming and makes one like myself want to do more than just sit around and wait for the day of reckoning. Overall, an Inconvenient Truth was quite provocative and thoughtful and left me with a sense of guarded optimism (well that is if the U.S. signs the Kyoto Treaty) for the future of mankind.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Politics are a renewable resource</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Al Gore should be forgiven for what could be perceived as weakening his message with shots of his childhood and political life. The message on global warming is loud and clear and this documentary rightly focuses on stimulating a reaction from the public, on saying something can be done rather that seeking to blame or find the culprit. We know we all are. The key answer to this apathy on the part of worldwide audiences is obviously politics. When issues are so big they make us individuals feel we can not single handedly solve them, that is when politics have to step in. Regardless of where you stand it is hard to deny that the current US administration is environmentally very weak and has repeatedly played the cards of the oil and military lobbies. All this documentary is saying is that given this huge problem and given the US's very weak record in tackling it the only way this can get any better is if there is a change in administration. It is happening already at the State level, it will follow at the federal level in 2 years time. Politics are a renewable resource and the US will eventually move from being a laggard to being a leader as it has done throughout its history, this time to the benefit of the whole planet.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A must-see for all in industrial nations</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As the credits rolled at the end of this film, my wife leaned over to me and commented about exiting the theater and climbing into our big 8-cylinder SUV and not doing our part to save our most important resource ? this planet Earth!Al Gore's film "An Inconvenient Truth" drew a round of applause from many in attendance. The ovation was not for Gore. Instead it was a thank-you for the 1.7 hour education and eye- opener surrounding the issues of global warming and the greenhouse effect. Gore opens this film by introducing himself as "the former" next president of the United States. He makes light of this but the film is as serious as they come. He details the effects of global warming by going back hundreds of years and how in past 30-years we see clear indications of the effect on our planet. Let's face it, Gore isn't the most electrifying person to listen to but in this film he is interesting, engaging, funny and sincere. He does his best to dispel the myths and misconceptions held by a few scientists, various industry and lobbyists. I have seen more than 50 films in theaters this year and this film is in a category of it's own. Every adult and child in industrialized nations should see "An Inconvenient Truth" as it is one of the best educational pieces I have seen in many years. The message is clear. We must all do our part to save our planet for future generations.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An excellent introduction to the issues of Climate Change</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film makes the science behind the problems contributing to Climate Change accessible to anyone who takes the time to watch it. And if you're unfamiliar with these arguments then it's really important to watch it.I've read the other comments on this page and I must say that I wholeheartedly disagree with the commenter who says it's all propaganda and that CO2 can't warm the planet to the extent claimed.Anyone who's seen the film (or read any papers on the subject) will have seen the way in which CO2 and temperature are directly related throughout all of surveyable history and that the limits within which Earth allows easy human habitation are being stretched. The way around this is not to further stretch them through new technologies but to learn to live within the limits of our planet.I'm not speaking from a propaganda point of view, I'm an Environmental Science graduate, now studying for a Masters degree in Environment, Policy and Society. If evidence were to appear that proved global warming and Climate Change to have been overestimated I'd be extremely happy but there really isn't any that I've seen and I can't comprehend a way in which the current predictions can be wrong; the only propaganda I've seen is from American oil-company-sponsored organisations and research, e.g. "CO2: They call it pollution. We call it life." All the independent research (certainly here in the UK) points to the need for immediate and drastic reductions in CO2 emissions, to an extent with which the UK Government is far from comfortable.In short, An Inconvenient Truth brings the facts to the masses and empowers them to decide whether to make the changes in their lives necessary to ensure our continued comfortable survival on Earth. Al Gore has done very well here and I hope his fight continues in the same vein.</fullReview>

It is really mind boggling to try and understand how politicians in the US are so greedy that they sacrifice lives all over the world with their greed and lack of support for changes in current policy regarding CO2 emissions. My only complaint is that Gore infers that it is only the BUSH administration that has dropped the ball, however, GORE was in office for eight years as Vice President and did nothing...so why is he finger pointing. I think this might be a platform for the Democrats to run for office, however, it does not take away from the fact that the facts are undisputed and the results are clearly documented. I think if we could get away from fossil fuels we might have something that our children can use in the next 100 years. Otherwise there will ocean front property in many new place and millions of people dead from lack of change. It is always hard to change, but it seems to me that our politicians are some of the most corrupt in the world at this time. We need a new vision, and not from a rich, greedy, oil magnate, we need good responsible leadership from someone who cares about this country and where it is going..please see the movie and force your politicians to move in the right direction!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love IMDb because they give the reader the opportunity to filter out the positive reader comments immediately and read only the negative comments. The one out of ten comments are always the funniest; they can be divided into the "scientists" who maim a film because they have "better" information; the political conservatives who denigrate Gore because he was that evil man's VP and finally a few writers who feel that only God can destroy the earth without people's help. Poor Al copped all of these and more. And for what, because he dared speak the truth and had enough political grunt to carry it off- it being the obvious truth about what humans are doing to a once pristine planet.This topic is particularly relevant to me living as I do in Australia. Indigenous people have inhabited this continent for 60,000 years and when, some 200 years ago, Europeans stole it from those caretakers; the continent sustained abundant life: flora, fauna and human. My point is simple: if the Aboriginal people can sustain the continent for over 60,000 years why are we making such a muck of it in our brief tenure on ours as well as the other continents.Our West Australian newspaper seems every issue to have an environmental story about something on the planet that is going wrong. All the things that Gore pointed out in An Inconveniet Truth are happening as you read this; Gore is not wrong and I hope the canery doesn't have to fall off its perch for us to wake up to his message.I held back one point from my vote only because of the didactic quality of some of what he said.

		<shortDescription>"That Al Gore Film"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Most Americans have heard of "that Al Gore documentary." Well here it is, AN INCONVENIENT TRUTH.If you've followed U.S. politics at all over the past 20 years, you know that Al Gore is the environmental poster-boy thanks to his take on global warming and other green issues. It wouldn't be difficult to surmise that his presidential run may have been hamstrung by this very topic. Big Business doesn't usually sit in the environmentally friendly arena, and Big Business most certainly contributes (via backdoors) to candidates financial checking accounts.For better or worse, Al Gore lost his presidential bid. The "better" aspect is that Al was then free to do whatever he liked with his life. He wouldn't be in the spotlight or battling legislators. So what did he do? He went back to his roots.An Inconvenient Truth, a lecture/slide-show Gore has probably given hundreds of times, would otherwise be pushed aside by politicians as an attack on industry if it were done by anyone else. But Gore's been on the inside. His science is strong and his data backed by nearly every scientist on the planet (note the word "nearly", as some simply do not agree, but the overwhelming majority ? 90% or higher ? do). This is an important fact, as scientists follow data, not personal beliefs or the S&amp;P 500.The entire documentary is about global warming and how amazingly ignorant or apathetic the world has become because of our reliance on outdated technology, our increasing population, and our refusal to change. The outdated technology is mostly about automobiles, since they produce the most greenhouse gas emissions. The fact that the world's population has gotten out of control can be seen simply by looking at various countries' census reports and then comparing them to agricultural and water needs. Our refusal to change is focused on throughout the film thanks to our reliance on oil, coal, and other non-replenishables.Al Gore has to be commended for doing such a great job on this documentary. He is the center of it, but he so effortlessly takes the focus off of himself and puts it on these hot-button topics that it's easy to forget we're learning material from a former vice-president. That was truly astonishing.Gore's passion for the global warming issues are admirable and most will probably be thankful that he's out there pushing this topic, trying to bend the ear of every person he possibly can. Make no doubt about it, he's making money off this project, too. But viewers would probably rather see someone as important as Gore making money this way rather than working for Enron or Exxon/Mobil.</fullReview>

It's a documentary of course... narrated/hosted by Al Gore where he goes over the cause/effect regarding global warming, especially in light of increasing changes in climate and weather just in the last year. Thankfully, he also goes over solutions at the end of the movie as well, even the credits give suggestions on how to fix things. Basically, reducing carbon dioxide emissions is at the core of human prevention. The bits and pieces of his life and politics weren't that obnoxious, though he could have done without them. Besides the environmental data he explained, I think the most startling fact to me was our population increase. For the whole of recorded history until the baby boomers were born, the world population grew to 2.3 billion people. We're talking for thousands of years. And then, since the 1950s, it's gone from 2.3 to 6 billion people with a projection to 9 billion people by 2050.Up until seeing this movie I was in the camp that said human impact on global warming was negligible when compared to natural climate cycles. I've changed my mind.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Inconvenient but exciting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When Participant Productions set out its goal, "to deliver compelling entertainment that will inspire audiences to get involved in the issues that affect us all", the results were a little uneven. Good Night, and Good Luck, was an Oscar-nominated dramatisation of events from the McCarthy era focussing on freedom of speech. North Country also looked at social issues, again with an impressive Hollywood cast, and picked up nominations for acting although its screenplay verged on cheesy in its upholding of women's rights. Syriana was a compelling thriller with a well-researched subtext exposing the intrigues of the global oil industry. Now into the fray comes An Inconvenient Truth, a documentary feature with Al Gore, "who used to be the next president of the United States", getting us fired up about global warming.It's an impressive science lesson, but if that doesn't sound exciting enough to get you out of your armchair and along to your multiplex on a Saturday night, maybe look at it from a different angle. Will it inspire you? Will it move you? Will it give you something to discuss as you come out of the cinema? And will it give the thrill of emotion that you feel you deserve having coughed up the price of an admission ticket? The answer to all those questions is, probably yes.My heart supported the movie even before I went to see it, but part of me felt that although it was very worthy that someone was tackling global warming, there was no real urgency to get to the cinema. Maybe, if Spielberg did a bank-busting, special-effects laden, futuristic adventure of the world slipping into chaos with melting of ice-caps, yes; but after I had dragged myself along to An Inconvenient Truth almost out of a sense of duty, I had to take my hat off to Mr Al Gore for presenting as an exciting, well-produced and fulfilling a movie as I could want for the price of a ticket. If he was a school-teacher, no-one would have ever skipped class.When global warming is bandied about so much, I enjoyed having all those questions we're meant to know the answers but don't like to ask explained. How do greenhouse gases cause climate change? Drought? Hurricanes? Floods? and so on, rather than just, well, a slightly nicer summer. It might not be rocket-science, but no-one ever told me as a kid. Gore doesn't miss his chance to say that the administration had been accurately informed of the extent of the damage Hurricane Katrina would cause, but he does so as part of a wider exposition rather than as political point-scoring. He comes across as witty, sincere, responsible and intelligent - he really does - which made me wonder if the American elections might have turned out differently if he had made this film years ago. There's something rather human about his passion. It says rather more about American values than, "he made lots of money, enjoyed spending it, and went to church every Sunday," and it makes you want to trust him. He appears to have pursued the facts about global warming with no little scientific integrity over many years and his production makes a welcome change from a political speech where we know the object is for the guy just to sell himself. Gore's transparent presentation skills alone make me want to watch it again and try to pick up some tips.You won't see many bad reviews - the main hurdle is making the effort to buy a ticket. Like the global warming debate itself, we tend to be locked into a lifestyle of minimal attention span. Thrillers, even second rate thrillers, fill seats, but a 'documentary' sounds off-putting. Gore suggests that there is zero dispute in the scientific journals over the main facts, whereas popular articles are split down the middle - a fact he attributes largely to deliberate campaigns by vested interests, which "reposition global warming as theory rather than fact". But how many of us spend the time to read a scientific journal? In a chilling reference to 9/11, the film shows a map of where the memorial will be, and projects a map to show the likely scenario where large parts of Manhattan, including Ground Zero, are under water. Although the film is very sober and thorough, the academic in me still wants to be able to check the quoted references personally, and it is a shortcoming that more sources are not listed, even in the film's end-credits or on the official website.Given that the time-scale before it is too late to prevent widespread disasters involving millions of lives is put quite believably at less than fifty years, and that governments, particularly the primary worst-offender, the USA, are in short-term denial; Gore is remarkably upbeat about the possibilities of success in taking effective action. It is this quality of indomitable optimism, armed with a solid armoury of reality, that makes us marvel that he is making movies rather than leading the most powerful nation in the world.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gore Opens a Vital Door to a Period of Consequence in Thwarting Global Warming</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like many others, I have been impressed by Al Gore's passion for environmentalism since reading his thoughtful and meticulously researched 1993 book, "Earth in the Balance", just as he became our Vice President. Reinforced by his decision this morning not to seek again the U.S. presidency in 2008, Gore obviously has an unwavering commitment to an all-encompassing, foreboding cause even as the oil companies continue to malign the validity of his arguments.The accountability of fossil fuels has engendered such heated controversy that Gore constantly seems on the edge of becoming a political pariah in contrast to more media-attuned topics such as terrorism and the economy. Even so, I was not expecting to be so enthralled by what is essentially a slide show that he estimates he has given over one thousand times in sixteen years on the perils of global warming. I am happy to report that first-time feature director Davis Guggenheim has done a superb job in capturing Gore's veracity and personal dedication with vigor and candor.Guggenheim reveals not only a Gore with foibles and a level of humanism missing from his previous media appearances but also an eye-opening look at the climatic chaos that Gore believes is quite fixable. In certain ways, the documentary is like watching a filmed record of a one-man Broadway show after the mandatory out-of-town tryouts. The result is polished in the best sense with an even-keeled pacing and a clear-eyed presentation of findings that increase in scope and personal proximity. The off-the-chart graphics presented are startling, for instance, the ten warmest years on record have all occurred since 1990 with 2005 the warmest on record. South America experienced its first hurricane off the coast of Brazil this past year, and an unprecedented number of typhoons have recently hit Japan.Gore shows comparative photos of the world's glaciers dramatically receding over the years, and also how a substantial piece of the Antarctic ice shelf has suddenly collapsed. His meticulous tracking of Katrina is revealing for the preventative measures that were ignored by political naysayers. He provides evidence of Greenland on the brink of a significant meltdown that would raise the global water level by twenty feet and then goes on to show the consequences in topographic maps of southern Florida, the San Francisco Bay Area, Lower Manhattan, Beijing, Shanghai and the Ganges River delta, areas where hundreds of millions will be permanently displaced.For all the palpable visions of Armageddon, the most surprising finding is the difference in press coverage between the scientific community and the mass media around the subject. Gore shares that there have been a total of 928 peer-reviewed papers supporting global warming according to a 2004 Science Magazine survey of all scientific studies of climate change. Meanwhile, a similar sample of stories from the mass media showed that a whopping 53 percent claim global warming is unproven, a belief hammered home by Senator Jim Inhofe of Oklahoma, who is shown in the film stating emphatically that global warming is all a hoax. Inholfe could perhaps have greater credibility if the U.S. was not responsible for over thirty percent of the world's greenhouse gas pollution.Perhaps Guggenheim's most noteworthy accomplishment is not turning the film into a political commercial for Gore. With the possible exception of an extended sequence where Gore shares his devastation with his controversial defeat for the U.S. presidency in 2000, there is a refreshing lack of pandering, as the former Vice President shares personal recollections - his childhood on a tobacco farm, his sister's death from lung cancer, his son's near-fatal accident - that make his perspective all the more resonant. Although I wish there was greater prominence to proactive steps than the end credit crawl, the film at least identifies them in quick order for viewers to start diverting the trend. This is essential viewing for anyone who mistakenly believes global warming is a partisan issue.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Important film that is not a biography about Al Gore</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are some that believe that this film is some secret agenda about Al Gore complaining about losing the 2000 election. This just isn't so. The sequence in the film that these people are referring lasts a couple minutes. It was placed in the film after explaining the US is responsible for the most CO2 gas emissions and how the US is not working hard enough to reduce these emissions. Basically, it is to contrast Pres. Bush, who comes from a family who has stakes in oil, and Al Gore, who has been working since the 1980s to reduce CO2 gas emissions. Any other references to Al Gore's life was to make the consequences of CO2 emissions more realistic on a human level... how the loss of life affects us. This sequence is by far NOT the focus of the film. I think it adds a wonderful element to the film so that it is not just a lecture, but also a documentary.</fullReview>

This documentary can give you lot of options why to watch this.The fore most, which I can also give is that, we will know where we along with our lonely planet are heading towards. Al Gore has given all the description in a very very convincing way. He has tackled all the information in the comical way. but he has been able to move the message across. This is a must see also because, this will tell us the way we can redeem ourselves, which of course is very important in the context of the result, what Mr. Al Gore assumes. There is a lot of scientific data that goes into this.The thing what Al Gore would like to say is to the respective governments with the aid of this documentary is that, we have no time left to play the blame game, what we should try is to try and cover our mistakes as soon as possiblefolks if you want to watch the future of this lonely planet(provided that, if we carry on as we are doing now) Then go watch it......</fullReview>

He even uses fun cartoons, and you'll see how he made the best out of his defeat from being President in the election of '99.As the docu progresses, he even discusses how global warming has its repercussions that extend towards effects such as epidemics, and new diseases that have emerged.His closing is delivered with much reiteration and finality; and even recollections of American triumphs - which display no reason that everyone has an excuse NOT to change or work for the better. It's also a very touching and optimistic denouement, but on the very last note - he tells us to hear our children asking "that question", right here, right now. I enjoyed the captions at the closing credits.A must see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Global Warming Warnings.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Former Vice President Al Gore attempts to educate viewers on the problems the world faces due to global warming. Fascinating and frightening simultaneously, Gore's environmental forays seem more and more legitimate due to recent natural disasters across the globe in the past few years. Director Davis Guggenheim goes the Michael Moore route by pointing his finger (and his camera) at conservative politicians who seem more worried about issues that are either overblown or just plain trivial. Gore is humanized and his obvious passion towards this subject matter makes the whole thing that much more relevant to casual viewers. Critically strong film that will likely grow in importance to social and scientific studies. 5 stars out of 5.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It doesn't matter what your opinion of Al Gore is. It also doesn't matter if some of the figures shown in the film were exaggerated as some suggest here. All you need to do is step outside next summer and feel the heat. In just the past 10 years, the summers here in Denver have been getting progressively hotter and drier. I'm sure many of the others reading these reviews can attest to similar conditions where they live.In this film, Gore presents to us visual proof that things are changing dramatically all over the planet. The presentation of the data and figures is undeniable and somewhat shocking. A lot of social conservatives tend to argue, "you can't believe everything you see and hear". Well that may be true, but you also can't disbelieve everything you see and hear. I find it unimaginable to think that somebody could watch this film and think that everything in it was false or politically motivated. Go see this film with an open mind, free of political bias, and decide for yourself.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"An Inconvenient Truth" is without question the the movie that defines our age. It ultimately asks--Do we value this little orb, this 'pale blue dot', as Carl Sagan poetically nailed it, which we bequeath to our children and grandchildren, or do we sink into armchair self-interest, turn up the a/c and ask the kids to bring us another cold beer? The sobering truth is that there are no viable alternatives to caring for this one-shot little orb. This is it! I confess, I found Al Gore's narrative astonishingly fare and balanced. He is no angry prophet hurling jeremiads, no mean spirited also-ran, but the quiet, measured voice of reason stating the objective and compelling case that the earth is in trouble. Without an international effort, that needs front loading with American will and expertise, we have, it appears, perhaps 30-40 years to turn things around. Even then, it seems, we may have lost to the advancing ocean thousands of miles of coast land and tens or millions of homes of a presently somnolent population.This is not a movie to argue the merits of. We don't have that luxury.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>1st watched 1/8/2007 - 8 out of 10(Dir-Davis Guggenheim): Well done documentary on the global warming crisis with Al Gore giving us more of himself than I witnessed in his entire vice-presidency and his presidential campaign. He might have won the election if he would have just focused on showing this movie. Anyway, he not only gives us the scientific facts behind the crisis but also his personal reasonings behind pursuing this at various points in his life. Everything from being taught this by a college professor in the late 50's to his son's near death experience woke him up to his need to share this information, and share it he has to over 1000 cities in the world and now a movie that is on DVD and can be seen by more people than ever!! The movie only hints at past political mistakes of others, but instead drives home the facts and the ability that we have to change the situation. This has to be the best documentary of 2006, if not just because of it's timeliness but also because it's very well done. And when you watch this movie, make sure you pay attention to the final credits(which I always do, of course) because more insights are given into what we can do to make a difference. Again, Gore uses a very non-political common sense approach to the facts, the problem, and what can be done today by all of us and he even adds a little humor in the mix(yes, even Gore has a sense of humor believe it or not).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was surprised to find out that congress and the scientific community had been informed of global warming since the 1960's. It doesn't surprise me they don't care to do anything. Mr. Gore tends to get a bit poetic and seems to be the optimist that we can somehow change. Mankind is a destructive force on this planet and we always will. When the time comes to take action it won't be hybrid cars, recycling, or cleaning up the environment. We will move out into space the Moon and Mars and continue to destroy those new lands we claim. Already NASA makes plans for a Moon base in my lifetime. Mankind will survive but the Earth won't, it will be tossed into the trashcan of space and humans will just move on. Most people who watch this documentary will say how sad it all is and continue life just as before. My sister refuses to watch it, saying it is just another "DOOM and GLOOM" picture, there is no global warming. Tell that to my neighbor his lawn is green and it is after Christmas, we should have at least 2 to 3 feet of snow where I live. This is a great documentary, unlike most it stays away from politics and puts the information in your face. Anyone saying there is no global warming after watching this is either hiding their head in the sand or has a personal gain from the destruction of our planet.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The world changes drastically for the worse in just fifty years. Sound like a really bad movie? In this case, it's actually an excellent piece of cinema.Former Vice President Al Gore opens our eyes to a subject that we tend to turn away from and stick on the back burner. An Inconvenient Truth pulls the veil from our eyes to show what is going on around us and has been for years. The documentary centers around one of Gore's deluxe PowerPoint-like presentations on the subject of global warming. The film also chronicles his struggle relaying the bad news, from his college days through his career as a politician, to as many people as he can reach.If the truth hurts then this film is pain. His presentation contains information so scary and so disturbing that it seems almost impossible to be true. What Gore brings to the table is information backed up with years of research and analysis that shows startling truths. Yes, the world is getting warmer. Yes, the ice caps are melting. The biggest truth, however, is that we are not doing enough to slow down these devastating changes. Through technology and innovation we are climbing the ladder to new heights where possibilities that were not even dreamed of are becoming realities. Sadly, we are still relying on old ideas and technologies that are not helping the cause to save the planet. The biggest reason is not that we don't have the money to but the lack of desire from big corporations and industries more concerned with the amount on the check than the millions of lives impacted each and every day. Rather than cleaning up energy sources we let glaciers disappear and lakes dry up.It's not all doom and gloom, however. The message of the film is that it's not too late to make a difference. There is still a lot that can be done to ease the planet's suffering. There are laws being made and people who are waking up and answering the call to action. Cities, states, and nations are rising up through the smog and breathing in the air of tomorrow. A cleaner, more efficient tomorrow that may one day have the word pollution stricken from the dictionary and placed in the history books as a word of the past. Our children and their children may not have to suffer if we don't take action. This, Gore's promise of tomorrow, is shaping up today.Through an assortment of graphs, still photos, videos, and models, the horror that is global warming is illustrated clearly and to the point. In fact, to the film's credit, there is very little scientific jargon and a lot of straightforward information that hits home. The film itself is relentless in its purpose. Filmmaker Davis Guggenheim portrays Gore not as a political figure but as a representative of morality. He allows one man's voice to be heard so that it can echo in the hearts and minds of others so that global warming becomes not just a theory but a reality for every living thing.Putting all creeds, religions, and political parties aside, this film speaks to the world as a whole. Gore's plan of acting small and having a snowball effect could one day save the planet. Skeptics and those unsure of where to stand on the issue of global warming should challenge themselves to see this film.Let it be known that I am not trying to persuade you into thinking global warming is real. I possess no credentials that would make me a credible source on the subject. I just watched the movie, listened to what Mr. Gore had to say, and relayed what I took from it to you, the reader. Gore quotes Winston Churchill who said we are in an "age of consequences." Clearly, we are starting to feel the repercussions of our actions of the past century and they are hurting us dearly. An Inconvenient Truth is exactly that. Global warming is an inconvenient truth that we all have to face today. If we don't, there may not be a tomorrow.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a truly important documentary, showing an intelligent, articulate and passionate leader doing his best to EDUCATE the people as to the imperative of addressing this global threat to humanity.Unlike such media-hyped threats to humanity as "World Communism", "Islamo-Fascism", "Global Terrorism" and the like, there are no mega-corporations with their hands in the cookie jar to hype this threat beyond reality. In fact, the threat is so pervasive, and on such a scale that the others I listed are trivial in comparison. There are no quick bucks involved, no government handouts as are prevalent in the "defense industry" and thus, as Mr. Gore points out, the corporate media has been falsely claiming that there is scientific debate as to whether or not global warming exists, and as to whether or not human activity is causing it. Mr. Gore points out, quite accurately, that this is false reporting - in fact a complete distortion of the views of the scientific community on this issue.Gore also shows that the kind of doubt being inculcated by the corporate media parallels the intentional spreading of doubt by the tobacco industry after the discovery of proof that cigarettes were the greatest cause of lung cancer.Anyone who sees this film, who sees the evidence of the need for fast and decisive action on OUR part and ignores it, will certainly get what he or she deserves.</fullReview>

Everyone that I have spoken to Also agree's with what Al Gore is saying in his documentary. What I don't like about the situation is that yes we can and I do start being more energy efficient in our own lives for example: Changing your light bulbs to the energy efficient ones - car pool - and heating but what really aggravates me is the the Government doesn't care (I.E. George Bush) Like Al Gore said they would care if there salary depended on it... If this was such a major issue - which it is... Why Doesn't the Government make Hybrid cars cheaper so Honest hardworking family's could purchase them.. I believe that if All Americans drove a Hybrid car of some sort it would make an substantial impact on the pollution going into the air... But then the smaller car producing companies would go out of business and that would be so bad for them... These car companies could make a huge impact on our planet but they are to worried about losing money then saving our planet...One Huge movement that could help save our planet is Why don't all the car companies merge into one company that makes hybrid/solar more efficient vehicle's and stop selling gas and diesel engines and make them affordable for everybody... But that would be a huge call to make on the vehicle industries's part.... Are they willing to help save our planet? Are they willing to take a cut in pay or are there pay checks more important? I want a life for my children, I want to make a difference but I'm one speck in this huge world.Is anyone else with me on this? Lets stand up.. Let our voices finally be Heard.............

However, while one cannot prove that one's turn at a game of Russian Roulette finds the bullet in the chamber, it would be foolish to gamble.

Here he lectures to a group of university students on matters such as unhealthy CO2 emissions, greenhouse gasses, melting ice caps/glaciers and freak weather conditions as well as the individual steps we each can take to do something about it.On paper An Inconvenient Truth must have seemed more like a potential insomnia cure than a movie idea. Former presidential candidate Al Gore, a man with a notoriously one tone voice, droning on about his views on what we can do to save great mother earth. So it's to his credit that this film is very interesting and holds your attention right to the end. Gore has a noticeable sense of humour and sense of incredulity in his voice, blowing away any misconceptions that he's the most boring man on earth, and rather than drone on continuously about the subject, he intersperses his lecture with cut scenes where he shares his personal feelings on events that have happened in his own life, such as his son being rushed to hospital and being put on a life support machine as well, of course, as his feelings on losing out to Bush in the elections. But he never forgets to mention what drives him to feel so passionately about this matter, some of which is very touching. All this and a Futurama clip to keep things flowing nicely. And, as if the movie wasn't doing enough right already, Gore doesn't forget to round his argument off properly by stressing about what we can do to make things better, rather than simply giving us a big doom and gloom prophecy.A very well made documentary, then, on a subject that's becoming more and more important with every passing day. ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a lecture...evocative, resourceful and alarming. AN INCONVENIENT TRUTH as a movie may be less interesting. Based on his book, former Vice President Al Gore raises the thoughts of the challenge for the future of our planet to change attitudes, climate and man-made pollutants in order for survival. Eye-opening and compelling dialog by Gore brings the wake-up call that global warming is a clear and present danger. Gore has developed this documentary over many years, as a way of educating civilization of the destiny of the world if global warming is not taken seriously. Political change can not be expected to be the solution...each and every life is to be part of the solution.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not many movies can scare me AND have a lasting effect. I was so incredibly impressed by the way Al Gore delivers his information. It's simple, straightforward and most importantly it's researched. I've seen many campaigns against global warming but I think this was the first to really open my eyes to how much we actually CAN change.I think in this film your emotions go straight from interest to denial to despair to hope, in that order. I feel this film should be seen by everyone. This is one of the few films I would support piracy or theft of, because it may be one of the most important films of our generation.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>ineffective for the educated, but then he doesn't need to reach the educated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An Inconvenient Truth is Al Gore presenting his truths about global warming. I believe that global warming is happening and that the scientific proof is there, although Al did not present it in a manner that left no questions. Some of the examples were wrong and not explained properly which would leave educated people questioning his facts. If educated people question this, then the uneducated will also question it, if they even take the time to pull their head out of the sand to watch it. I liked it, but it was not an extremely good work. It is a must watch, but again as Al said, you can't get lazy self indulgent people to watch something that would mean they change the way they get their cappuccino. I think we should have accountability attached to this. If the conservatives are correct, then the liberals should be chastised in the history books and if the liberals are correct then the conservatives should be chastised in the history books. The only problem is that global warming may exclude the need for history books since there may not be anyone to read them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I hope Al Gore remains outside the political arena</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In reading the comments on this film, the politics are obvious. Yet, this isn't about a political issue, but a moral and ethical one. Hence my summary... If Al Gore can continue to remove the taint of partisan politics from his public persona, he can squelch some of the reactionary criticism that accuses this film of bring a shameless bid to further a personal agenda. Of course, on one level it is - but only because environmentalism is at the core of much of his personal agenda. However, by staying out of partisan politics, he can partially neutralize those who would say that he's only doing it to create a groundswell which would sweep him back into power.But all that ignores the point of the film... Even if Gore's motives were as self-serving as some accuse, does it change the issues presented in the film? Of course not! There is a natural human tendency to dismiss good advice coming from people we don't like. If you were standing on a railroad track and Hitler (or Stalin, or Idi Amin, or {insert your own favorite villain here} told you a train was coming and you should move, would you stand your ground because of your personal distaste for the one advising you to move? Well, you might if you're an ideologue (and/or an idiot), but a smart person wouldn't.Which brings us back to the film. It doesn't take anything more than access to Google to verify that the facts, as presented in this film, are largely accurate, if overly simplistic. Similarly, it doesn't take that much to discredit many of the film's critics who have neither the credentials nor the data to support their criticism. Worse yet, most have personal stakes in maintaining the status quo.However, let's do talk about the science a bit... Human-induced global warming with CO2 as the primary culprit has become a bandwagon issue. This is unfortunate since it probably is a straw man. This has both good and bad aspects. It's bad that someday the errors in the current theory will be revealed and compromise the whole environmental movement. It's good in that it gets average people to step up and support environmentalism. Redneck Joe Sixpack might not care about coral reefs or polar bears or Amazon deforestation, but tell him global warming might ruin the barley and hops crops and he's on board in a heartbeat.This film does an excellent job of laying out a clear, concise picture of popular global warming theory. More significantly, it is a great film to recruit new converts to environmentalism. Regardless of its accuracy in discussing global warming, the larger message is respect for the planet and better shepherding of its natural resources. With raised environmental consciousness, it will become a moral imperative for each one to do something to become part of a solution rather than part of the problem. It doesn't require political activism, although that's a path many may choose. It does require a personal commitment to take individual responsibility to contribute to a solution. These are points emphasized in the film.This having been said, it's not perfect. It's a little overly slick in spots and some inconvenient contradictions are glossed over, ignored, or summarily dismissed, making it a ripe target for nit-picking. Still, the overall argument is compelling. When you can witness deglaciation on an unprecedented scale in Antarctica and Greenland, or if you do the research on coral bleaching, the nits being picked fall into perspective.Finally, for the remaining fence-sitters, one question has to be asked. If there's even the remotest possibility that what this film is saying is true, can we afford to ignore it? Doing so is betting the lives of future generations on our presumptive understanding of complex phenomena that we're only beginning to understand.This may not be be the best or even the most accurate film ever made, but it is perhaps the most important.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie is very concise and striking, thanks to the calm voice of "Al Gore". We were frightened to see again the causes of climate crisis. I think many nations doesn't apply the Kyoto system of rules to save our earth. I got two friends in California one of them told me ten years back: "John, we got just one earth under our feet, we must save it". USA have said "NO" to the Kyoto accord, but i'm sure million of American people are all for. I was sad when I saw the disaster of Katrina on the New Orleans state. the hurricane are one of the most destructive power resulting from the climate crisis. Here in Martinique and on the continent Europe, Germany and some other states are working to save our earth applying what is necessary. France is somewhat slow thanks to the gold people who prefer to ride in a car whose energy is destroying the earth, to sell cars burning gas and so on. The people themselves, beginning with me and my neighbor, are not yet applying all for that.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Even though I have nothing to do with the United States, I was kind of devastated when Al Gore, in spite of getting more votes, lost the US presidency back in 2000 to that W fellow, especially because the former VP was well known for his concern over the environment. We all sure needed that kind of man in the White House... Our good old Earth is obviously heading towards disaster unless people wise up, that has become clearer and clearer throughout the years. I used to say to my kids and to my students that the world THEIR children will live in will be a much more troubled one than it is today in terms of environmental issues. Now I'm not so sure, maybe we won't have to wait that long, maybe 'irreversibility' is a word that will apply to too many growing problems even in my lifetime (I am 42): for instance, some even say that it is already too late to stop and reverse the sea rise. Maybe. What is worse is that much of the older population can't or won't be 'educated' anyway, so this documentary should be shown in classrooms all over the world, in every school, in every college. Congratulations, Mr Gore, for this 'climate crisis bible' called "An Inconvenient Truth". In some ways you are (still) our global hero.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An inconvenient truth may be preaching to the converted, but that certainly doesn't detract from the delivery of this impassioned appeal by the man who was once almost the U.S. president (that fact hurts almost as much as our movement towards self-destruction). Al Gore's documentary showcases his ability to communicate and articulate huge concepts with great skill, and his ability to grasp these concepts are as worthy of noting as is the current sitting U.S. president's inability to do the same. Gore cares deeply, and he feels it is humanity's ethical obligation "to do the right thing". He rightly believes that where there is a will there is a way - the enigma really is why the will is so hard to find in the world's greatest contributer to climate change. This is a must see for everyone - especially those who are ambiguous as to our impact on this suddenly shrinking and unpredictable globe. Leave your arguments for after you've been informed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The scariest movie I've seen in years!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw "Saw III", and "The Grudge", and although those are movies that may frighten you, at the end of the movie you feel relief... "An Inconvenient Truth" is another kind of movie. I felt scared while I was watching, and 3 hours later, I'm still scared. In The US, some people may see this as a "liberal" piece, or some kind of advertising made by "tree-huggers", for "tree-huggers", or even psychological eco-terrorism. I don't subscribe to this point of view. It's not a documentary 'per-se', it's a slide show about Global Warming. It's not very flattering to some republicans, and would be such a ignorant thing to see the message of the movie as 'pro-democrat'. There are more important matters then partisanship here. Anyway, I recommended it, and I left a message to our north-American brothers: you should really think about change your way of life.</fullReview>

I drive a car with a very small engine: 800 cc! This car does not compare with cars with big v engine with eight or six cylinders and a capacity between 5000 cc and 6000 cc,imagine the emissions that this cars release in the air!It is a very well done documentary about global warming danger and i will tell about it to my friends!This is a real problem friends and we have to do all that we can to prevent a ecological disaster!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To my opinion, this is a very effective film. It succeeded in its initial purpose: to raise public awareness, to bring attention to the issue of ecology, climate change and to how we treat this problem. In that respect the film is absolutely successful, and I am very proud to have worked on it as part of production team. In the film, Al Gore states, "Global warming is not a political issue, it is a moral issue." To me it is both a political and a moral issue, of course, but both are important. When Gore reflects about the White House poster/chart with the woman drawn on it/ looking at the scale. On one side of the scale there is a gold bar, on the other ? the entire planet. The woman is choosing reflecting: which one to chose?.. Ever metaphor that Al Gore uses is very effective and often very witty. One can argue about details, certain scenes, certain photographs, but my overall recommendation is to see it. It is important, contemporary, and puts Hollywood means to good use.</fullReview>

Although some of the statistics shown may be incorrect, do we really expect correct statistics? Wouldn't it be too late then? Ask yourself,...what matters to us, and what should be ignored but to know what is the right thing and when to do the right thing.I am confused myself (as a person out of billions), as to how am I suppose to re-act tho this? Would one person make a difference? Because people do not seem to bother anymore at this time, maybe because of greed. Why are we controlled by these rich people, when everybody has the right to own this planet. Just because they have the ability to control certain market, does not mean they can grab our happiness away. What is this earth belong to them solely, and people outside their class should treat them like Gods? This is extremely absurd. One thing for sure, we have to stop thinking that we are incapable of doing the right thing just because we do not have monies. We can, as long as we still live. Think of the present and the future.

My favorite was the editing of environmental news that went on in White House - that part alone is worth the admission price.Maybe the only thing that impresses more (in a bad way though) is the stubborn denial, by some, of the environmental bad news, a denial that intensified as this film came out.

I cannot emphasize enough how people have to take notice of the damage that is being done to the planet. I applaud Al Gore for what he is doing, and it was absurd that the American public should be revered from voting from this man because his views were more concerned with environment than the economy ... This man is ahead of his time in terms of American visionary .. he looks beyond the immediate .. All too often America and whoever else are too ready to rush without forethought or planning. If people did pause for a moment and think about the consequences it could bring more fruitful rewards... (look at the environment conscious Toyota who are about to buy Ford out). All should take leaf out of Al Gores book...

Gore does a fabulous job of explaining just how fast this planet is starting to warm. The scary thing was seeing that in a few years there will be no more snows of Kilmanjaro.

With the lack of water resources some cities/towns are down to drastic levels. If all new developments had tanks made compulsory, there were be no need for new large dams. The longer the "big dry" continues, this documentary appears to have the answers. Solar energy is not used enough here either. With all the sunshine, solar energy would reduce a lot of the greenhouse gases. Al Gore has recently visited Australia and met with our leaders, but he hasn't been able to convince our Prime Minister of the need to change. Animals are suffering as well as people.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I first saw this documentary on a plane trip from Australia to the USA in September and was unimpressed we were about to watch something I thought would be completely boring - after all this is a long trip and good movies are essential!! I was completely wrong!! I was really impressed by Al Gore's presentation - he was absolutely compelling and had me captivated from the beginning. Before seeing this documentary, I was complacent about the effects my actions would have on the environment and global warming, but this movie changed my thinking dramatically.If you care about YOUR world for YOUR children, watch this documentary and get your family and friends to do the same.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wish this movie could be on every TV station for 24hrs every day until we change what we are doing.The movie would be improved by cutting out scenes with Al Core looking out various windows. The Bush/Gore election scenes could also be removed to avoid making any political references. Also, if you don't like Al Gore, don't ignore the message because of the messenger. My views of Al Gore have greatly improved due to his excellent presentation. No wooden or cowboy style here. Too bad he did not make this movie before his failed election campaign. He comes across as an excellent spokesman, intelligent, witty, ethical, and responsible. His role in history will be far greater as a spokesman for this cause than as a president of a nation which is rapidly loosing the respect of the international community.The fact that New Orleans will be rebuilt at the same place where it was destroyed is totally irresponsible. If Mother Nature takes a house away, no rebuilding should be allowed unless the house is rebuilt to withstand another disaster, with possibly greater impact. The "2K problems", which were predicted, never happened. But those predictions were based on faulty technical understanding of how oil, electricity, water, and food is produced and delivered. Now the fault in thinking is that Mother Nature will fix this, or other people will change.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A "Must See" Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just as it is commented, "the most frightening movie you will ever see." People can't have everything and be lazy about it. The people of the world can't say to themselves, "Hard work pays off later, and lazy pays of now." Uuummm NO!!! People need to step up and take charge of the situation of global warming. This is our home we're talking about! Our only one! It's time to stop being lazy and do the hard work now. It has come to the point where we don't have the choice to put it off. If half of Greenland and half of Antarctica melted, the see level would rise 20 feet. That is not okay!!!!!! That is basically what this movie is telling us. It will probably be the most important movie you will have seen yet. What is more important than saving our one and only home. Isn't it evident that we should do something? Ooohh um I don't know, is not an answer. Now is not the time to be lazy!!!!!! Losing a vast number of species is imminent. Highschools are encouraged to start clubs that can contribute to helping this cause against global warming. At Crescenta Valley Highschool, there are already some clubs that help the cause; such as www.projectcooldown.org and The Green Earth Club. Everyone should have clubs like these. Al Gore makes an extremely important point. Watch this movie and you will surely get your head turned and ears turned on to the situation. I recommend this movie to everyone!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Al Gore Is The Bringer of the Truth - A Must See for Any Conscious People.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I found this documentary riveting and shocking even though I have had concerns about global warming, I am now alarmed. This documentary reveals that we each need to prioritize our love for Mother Earth. Al Gore backs his Global Warning with indisputable scientific fact - this is not a political ploy by Al Gore who has been concerned about the environment for decades. If this documentary is not enough to make you wake up, the shots of huge icebergs crumbling before your eyes will. Believe the facts and only the facts. View this documentary and make up your own mind, do not be swayed by media propaganda by the oil companies, the electric companies or the Bush Administration.As you are shocked and instead of concerned, you become alarmed, before fade-to-black you will ask yourself - what can I do to stop Global Warming? Al Gore gives you many ways to take action beginning right now. What kind of planet are we leaving for children and their children and their grandchildren's children? See it - believe it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>And now that we all know.....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Al Gore created the film AN INCONVENIENT TRUTH as an important step to alert the global audience to the threat of global warming that is all too terrifying. Some may dismiss this well-made documentary as Gore's reaction to the election debacle that placed our current 'President' in an undeserved office, but that is just another true piece of this alerting film. Gore is the preacher/prophet here and he comes off as an admirable, warm, human, wise teacher whose mission is to bring us all into action.The facts are now clear, thanks in many ways to both Gore's book and film. Gore takes the role of professor here and demonstrates by graphs and charts and then terrifyingly real photographic comparative images just how endangered our planet really is. This may not be a film that allows us to put our heads on restful pillows at night, but then that is the purpose. Without threats, without shouting from the pulpit, Gore merely relays the facts, negates the skeptics, and finally extends his hand to show each of us how we can participate in change, be that change communicating with our government officials to take immediate action or how to convert our own walking atmosphere into a healing place.Art has always opened the windows of light on society's foibles. AN INCONVENIENT TRUTH does just that and now that the DVD is out perhaps even broader coverage of this disastrous situation will find its way into the homes of everyone. We are all involved in the warming of the globe: we are all responsible and must excite change. Grady Harp</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Thank God I live in Chicago... Just Kidding! Boy, that wasn't a good way to start off this comment. :P I just watched An Inconvenient Truth because my mom has just been driving me insane with her watching all this global warming stuff on the weather and history channel, I just wanted to get my facts straight since I don't watch that much television and could finally get her to quiet down about it. But this turned into a decent and straight to the facts documentary about what has been happening to our planet for the past 4 decades.First a paragraph on the two things that ticked me off about this film. First off, Al Gore, there were some clips about his childhood, his son being in an accident, and how he lost the election in 2000, I have one question, unless I missed something, what did that have to do with the documentary? And secondly, I'm so sick of America living in constant fear of this and that, and An Inconvenient Truth is well, inconvenient! It's just adding fuel to the fire.However, I believe this is a movie not to be missed, because I'm going to admit this for the first time, I was in a lot of denial. I didn't realize truly how much we take the earth for granted and we need to try our best to help prevent these horrible tragedies from happening. Although I'm still not sure if this will be happening in the near future, only God can tell us that, and we just have to do the best we can to prevent it. An Inconvenient Truth is a very important documentary we should watch, for at the sake of future generations.7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hits you with the power of your inescapable responsibility</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Al Gore presents an extremely persuasive, entertaining and convincing lecture on the science of global warming, it's impact and our role and responsibility towards it. Like most people watching, I do not have a scientific background and don't know enough about the science to verify for myself the claims that Gore presents. Thankfully though, we live in the information age where the research I have done has only supported this movie.To tackle some common complaints: first of all, Gore hardly mentions the 2000 election at all, and where he does it is only presented within the context of his motivation to hit the road and continue presenting this lecture. To suggest he spends anything other then a couple of minutes on this is a gross misrepresentation of the movie. Secondly, Gore does not 'claim' anything himself here; he merely presents inarguable fact to reach an inescapable conclusion. It is astonishing that there are so many would-be intelligent people who try to muddy the whole issue of global warming to satisfy a base desire to score some cheap political point. It's inappropriate, irresponsible and dangerous.Ultimately, this movie leaves you with both a desire to make a change (and points you in the direction of how you can start) and leaves you feeling an appropriate level of guilt for your part in the collective eroding of our beautiful world that has taken place over the last fifty years. Compelling and unexpectedly entertaining also, this is one of the few must-see movies of 2006.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An inconvenient Truth, the title speaks for itself. A great documentary on the basis of many proved scientific facts cannot leave you unaffected. Of course there is always the other side of view, the side of the money. There are people who don't want to know the truth, because it's too scary, they prefer a happier lie. And there are also people who don't want to know the truth, because of personal benefits. Al Gore didn't make the film for his benefit, but for the profit of all mankind and future generations. And he has proved that fact.A global warming is an issue that you cannot deny. The sooner we start doing something about it, the less painful will be the consequences.If you consider yourself to be a bit broad-minded see this movie. But not only knowledge matters, this movie is about action. Everyone, everywhere can put its piece together to the better and healthier future. And we all want that, don't we ?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Vital for the mainstream, but no radical solutions</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've not posted before but don't believe that a review of a film whose purpose is telling you about climate change could contain spoilers...This is a compelling and important film, putting what I believe to be one of the most urgent issues of our time before a wider audience. The accumulation of information really makes the point that something serious is happening and that action needs to be taken and taken now!However, I did feel that it's a bit too much of an "Al Gore Show" and crucially, he doesn't really use the ultimate four-letter word - less. Al Gore is one of the majority who really seem to believe that we can carry on living our lives pretty much as we do now and yet still make drastic cuts in our carbon emissions.I suppose that for the majority(?) who know little or nothing about global warming it will be a real and essential eye-opener, and as I don't fall into that camp perhaps I'm being overly critical here.He suggests that we can all make changes - change our light bulbs for low-energy versions, turn down our thermostats, drive less and so on. All these are essential steps in reducing our consumption, but ultimately they are limited. This is where I feel the film is lacking in any political analysis - surprising from a politician! Al Gore says tellingly at one point "This is not so much a political issue as a moral one." and I believe that that is why we're in such a mess. How did we manage to separate the two? Politics in more than ever before about the power and influence of moneyed corporations dictating the agenda. If morals have left the scene then what are we going to get? It also allows Gore to avoid looking at the political obstacles being put in the way of measures which could reduce our emissions and how we redress them. So much of this film is about what's not addressed by it.The US government has extraordinary links with the fossil fuel industry so I don't understand how people posting comments here can say that this is not a political issue - it's the biggest political issue we've ever faced! Politics is about applying a philosophy of life and we currently have a philosophy that says whatever big business wants it gets - and the planet can go hang.How will we you get binding international frameworks on carbon reduction by turning down your thermostat? And technology will not save this one. We have more efficient appliances than every previous year but in which direction does our overall energy consumption go? Yep, upwards. We must buy and use less. This is a drastic global problem and it needs drastic global solutions but it's much easier to pretend that changing your light bulb will do the trick - "I've changed all my light bulbs, now where did I put my air ticket for the week's holiday in the Seychelles?". The suggestions at the end of the film are essential for each of us to make, but we need deeper personal changes and we need serious political changes too. Now. But I certainly believe that this film is an important part of the former.</fullReview>

Climate change is just such an issue, because in order to confront this truth, we have to do inconvenient things, like driving smaller cars, switching off the air-conditioning. Yes, there will be incorrect details in this movie, but the overall message is so clearly correct. The movie is enthralling - Al Gore is a self-effacing star in the best sense. I urge everyone who cares what we leave our children to see it, go home, think and act. The reason I say act is because this dilemma will not be solved by grand gestures from politicians (who are always self interested.) It needs you and me, our friends and enemies to act in such way that we shame our leaders into real action.Go see the movie.</fullReview>

Global dimming is said to create a cooling effect that "may have partially masked the effect of greenhouse gases on global warming".The predictions in this movie is frightening, and a person who doesn't even consider the facts of global warming to be true in my opinion is closing their eyes too the facts. It can't be a political issue to at least look at the facts and make your own conclusion.BBC make some of the best documentaries there is, and this one is well worth seeing even if you don't believe in the effects of global warming.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie started fairly predictably with a scene of a river floating slowly by. Thick-leaved branches hanging over and into the water create an atmosphere of serene, natural beauty. Then one of the next shots depicts some dark plume coming from a chimney of some industrial installation. Al Gore speaks fluently and authoritatively about issues of Global Warming. His slide show and graphs would look impressive if you are in the real audience, seeing them on the big screen. It doesn't quite work in cinema. He also gets the points across quite impressively and comprehensibly which is quite good for those who don't know what Global Warming is. However, I thought that the movie is not strongly enough concerned with the fact that Economic Growth invariably adds to Global Warming and that if we want to change anything than we must change our consumerist attitude towards life. Only by reducing consumption can we reduce Greenhouse Gases. By changing resources (ie. from Oil to Biofuel) we will just create another problem with solving the first one. It was, in my opinion, fairly apparent that Al Gore would not go into the Economic details because he would probably not make as much impact on the viewers as otherwise.Global Warming cannot be halted unless we dramatically change our attitudes towards consumption. Katrina was just the beginning. Fasten your seat belts. Good Night and Good Luck !</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A doc mostly for Americans, a little overdramatised, but good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If it weren't for the inserts of Al Gore being thoughtful and melancholic about his kid's accident and him losing the elections, this would have been a better film.What it basically describes are scientific facts, presented in a managerial or politician's way (lots of slides, few words, no numbers or math), that show that we as a species are responsible for what is happening to the weather now and Americans most of all, being the most polluting country and the less concerned about it. A few cheap shots at the present administration don't really hurt, they are few and are actually fact based. This is mostly a popular science documentary, not a political show, and the only thing different from, say, a Discovery Channel show, is the personal way of presenting it, with Al Gore being the narrator and showing his own point of view.So, it's a good watch to raise awareness or a nice lunch or breakfast film.</fullReview>

We are being swamped in disinformation by selfish corporate moguls who want nothing other than to perpetuate their own worldwide fascist empires. This represents a spectacular failure of leadership. Of course Gore had to address that issue or else the movie would be meaningless hand-wringing.The 'autobiographical' part was included to illustrate the courage needed to effect change. He made two points with his own personal story. The first is that even his own family had an integrity issue with the tobacco plantation, and that they gave up their business out of regret for the deaths they had caused. He showed that change is required on a personal level. The second point is that when influential people go on TV and call environmentalists 'crazy', or when the Supreme Court hands over the nuclear arsenal to a malevolent spoiled brat, it is up to the rest of us to step in and lead.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As nearly everyone must know, this documentary brings to the big screen a visually enhanced version of Al Gore's slide show on global warming, a talk he says he's given at least a thousand times over the past several years, from Beijing to Portland. It is a brilliantly assembled effort, the first feature documentary by the director, whose previous work was limited to TV drama episodes, one narrative feature and a couple of shorts. Statistical charts and excellent footage illustrate in an entirely convincing manner the potentially cataclysmic consequences of what is probably the world's most worrisome looming problem. Did you know that the 10 warmest years in recorded history occurred during the last 14 years? Have you seen the huge contraction of glacier masses around the world? Are you aware of the thinning of the arctic ice mass? Of the melting of ice in Greenland? (All are vividly displayed here.) Gore's narration is remarkably effective. Unlike Michael Moore, Gore avoids self promotion and emotional hyperbole. Yes, he appears often for brief moments throughout the film. But he is unobtrusive; his manner is even toned and understated. He lets his meticulously arranged information and visuals speak for themselves. Talking heads are nowhere to be seen. Every voting citizen, every politician, should see this stunningly accomplished, chilling movie. My grade: 9/10 A (seen on 08/11/06)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book "Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!" Get it at Amazon.)Who is this truth inconvenient for? It's inconvenient for ExxonMobil. It's inconvenient for the Bush White House. It's inconvenient for the evangelicals who think that the rapture is only a few years away--so who cares if the planet turns into a humid swamp a few years down the road? They and their topees and their Jerry Falwell posters will be going to heaven--so, so, sorry, non-believers! I really didn't expect a lot from this production. I've read at least my share of books on global warming. So I didn't expect anything new. Yet there was something new. The fact that the soil loses moisture to the atmosphere as the temperature rises, the fact that sea ice breaking off can accelerate the breaking off of land ice, the fact that typhoons in the Southern Hemisphere have hit record levels--these facts and a few more I didn't know until I viewed this video. But even more significant was the lucid clarity of the presentation. Instead of writing a book for the few, Gore made a video for the many.You don't want to miss this. Here is a guy who could be president of the United States. Here is a guy that arguably got cheated out of the presidency. Here is a guy who is light years ahead of the present occupant of the White House in almost everything that we consider noble in humanity. And what does he do after losing a microscopically close race that maybe he really didn't lose? He recognizes the greatest problem facing humanity; educates himself to an outstanding degree on the subject, and then puts together a program for informing as many citizens as possible about the grave danger facing this planet. This production is the result of all his work.All I can say is, Gore for President in 2008! Would that it were possible. The special interests and the head-in-the-sand couch potatoes will find some way to ridicule him; and the corporations against the truth about global warning will pour massive bucks into making sure that he is not one of the candidates in 2008.One of the other things that I thought about while watching this outstanding video, this PowerPoint presentation deluxe, this slide show for the century, this beautifully presented visual argument for action now before it is too late--is how amazing it is that the people who control the media, who make sure that, as Gore points out, the truth of global warming is thought to be scientifically "controversial," when in fact there is no scientific controversy at all, only a commercial media controversy--how amazing it is, I thought, that despite all the mass media control, the message is getting out. This video is being seen by millions of people.Be sure you see it. The worst case scenario for global warming is worse than almost any other imaginable disaster. Terrorism, even nuclear warfare, pales in comparison to the earth in a runaway greenhouse catastrophe. Imagine Venus with the surface temperature hot enough to melt lead. Global warming could lead to a sterilization of the planet.And THAT is why Gore has devoted himself to warning us.Bottom line: this is a smart, sharp and very moving visual presentation, brilliantly directed by Davis Guggenheim, a presentation that I hope reaches an enormous audience, who will in turn assert themselves toward saving the planet before it is too late. Remember, a runaway greenhouse effect could reach a stage, without our knowing it, past the point of no return.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can't believe how many truly ignorant people have actually seen this movie, and then taken the time to pound out 10 lines of text. I've never sided with any political party and didn't vote for Gore, but this film did a very good job at keeping his climate speeches separate from his personal/political life. Very well done! It would be insanely easy to just make a movie to bad mouth the administration and republicans in general, and granted he did,but it was not the focus of the movie. Back to my main point, this movie was about the consequences of our decisions to use extremely dirty methods of producing energy, period. The fact that this gentleman decided to make a more dramatic, however not unscientific, approach to pointing this out doesn't negate the fact that there are very serious consequences to consuming fossil fuels. Also, republicans please take note that the Bible is all drama, from eating the forbidden fruit to killing your brother to the apocalypse. The thing I detest is that republicans take offense to this movie because, whether admitted or not, it was put out by a liberal, the science isn't exact and to make any corrections would be expensive and detrimental to the oil industry. I've noticed that a lot of the posts about this movie from people who obviously disagree, mention money, be it how expensive alternate fuel systems are, to how much it would cost to clean up the environment to the cost of reforesting the rain forests, etc. The best thing about this movie is not the facts that the Ice caps ARE melting, that Greenland's glacier's ARE melting, that overall the planet's temp IS rising, and the FACT that the Atlantic current does dictate a huge part of the World's climate and any small change like the ice caps/Greenland's glaciers melting would affect the Atlantic and throw us into an ice age, (This relationship was all in Meteorology 1001, ISUN) and could all just be a cycle of our Planet. Who cares if it's a cycle!? An Ice Age is an Ice Age, and we can't survive it! So back to the best part of the movie... it makes people think, it makes you think whether pro or con about problems that we may (or may not) have caused, and we need to work out a solution, period, whether it happens in 2006 or 5076 , we need to take care of our home.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"An Inconvenient Truth" is a documentary on Al Gore's traveling presentation about the reality of global warming, the greenhouse effect, and what we can do as ordinary people to save our environment for future generations. After reading some online reviews, it seems that a lot of people are judging this documentary *before* they even see it. Politics aside, you *don't* need to like Al Gore or have a liberal political leaning to appreciate the data he provides in this very coherent and well presented documentary. It could have been any other person giving this talk, and the facts and results would be the same. So I urge people to go watch this with an open mind, and make your *own* judgments based on what is presented. Think for yourself.With that said, I give this film a 10 out of 10 mainly for message it sends out, as there are better documentaries out there like "Why We Fight" or "Bowling for Columbine". This one, while well done and humorous at times, is really simple. It records one of the talks that Al Gore gives, interspersed with some more "dramatic" pieces (which sometimes can be a bit cheesy). The main point of the movie lies in the facts that Gore presents, even if the correlation between the facts and what's happening to the Earth could be debated. While those of you who follow environmental science news will already know all the information he presents here, it's still worth a viewing just to get a more coherent presentation of all the data.There are many opponents to film and the greenhouse effect theory, and people brushing this film off as "scare tactic" (as one can see in my comments section, someone already replied before I even wrote this full review!). Yes, I will be the first to say that this movie does present a one-sided view on the connection between greenhouse gases and global temperature, *but* is the message bad for our world at all? Save energy, use more efficient machines and vehicles, be kinder to the environment... What is so offensive and "scary" about all those suggestions that Gore gives? Thus again, go see the film yourself and then make a judgment. Don't just judge because of what others say or only because you hate Gore.Speaking of Gore, he surprised me in the film. He's definitely not the wooden guy in the 2000 elections anymore. He's actually funny now, and that is quite surprising to me. =) Anyway, this may turn out to be the most important documentary to come out in a while, as it affects our future generations and us. Watch it, then go collect data yourself, and make a decision for yourself. Hopefully enough people will change their lifestyles enough that the dire predictions in the documentary will never come to be.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gore's magnum opus.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A good movie. Gore presents compelling points in his slide show documentary. The movie is marred by diversions from the main idea, but they come together in the end. Many of them are distracting and self-aggrandising, mostly with the purpose of making himself look more fervent as an anti-global-warming crusader, but the movie is very good nevertheless. It uses charts and graphs to make its point compellingly, but I do have a gripe with the movie. Watch the numbers on the graphs carefully when you watch the movie. The fuel efficiency standards of various countries chart, for instance, makes the US look like its fuel efficiency standards are a quarter of Europe's until you look at where the chart's bottom and top are. This does not alter the point Gore is seeking to make, but it can be misleading. So: very great movie by an undoubtedly honest man, but watch out on the graphs. Just be wary when you see a graph.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Inconvenient Truth</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SYNOPSIS: Humanity and the fate of the world as we know it is sitting on a time bomb set to explode. If the vast majority of the world's scientists are right,we just have ten years to avert a major catastrophe that could send our entire planet's climate system into a tail-spin of epic destruction involving extreme weather,floods,droughts,epidemics and killer heat not to mention the plague and waves that are beyond anything we have ever experienced. In all a catastrophe of our own making. A planet that we called Earth is headed for self destruction unless something is done about it.If this sounds like a recipe for serious gloom and possible doom of everything that is vast on this planet,think again. From director Davis Guggenheim comes one of the biggest hits out of the Sundance Film Festival. The motion picture documentary,"An Inconvenient Truth" offers a passionate and inspirational look at one man's commitment to expose the myths and misconceptions that surround global warming and inspire actions to prevent it. That man is former Vice President Of The United States Al Gore. Not to mention by the way that this is Al Gore's motion picture debut and he is very conceiving as an actor and narrator in this movie that runs at a mere 90 minutes in length.After a stunning defeat in the 2000 election,Gore resets the course of his life to basically focus on a planet that is not only saving it,but also saving it for irrevocable change. His eye opening and poignant portrait of a planet in jeopardy is riveting in stunning detail as the film keys in certain conditions where the planet is about to face turmoil. It is thought prokoving information,fascinating and sometimes frightening with images that will not only make you think but take notice very quickly. Gore is funny,engaging and downright open on fire about getting surprisingly stirring up the truth about what he calls our "planetary emergency" out to our citizens before it is too late.. Gore's point here about our planet is very simple: "We have a moral imperative,as individuals and as a nation,to do something about global warming". The film takes a deadly serious problem and gives it a personal and important matter that needs to be addressed before the worst comes. Brilliant piece of documentary film making at its finest.And they say,"The DaVinci Code" is one of the must see movies of 2006? They are sadly mistaken. This is not only educational but logical in a grand way. "An Inconvenient Truth" was surely be an Oscar contender for Best Documentary. One of the best of 2006.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A smartly-crafted doc</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Al Gore is not waffling these days: He believes deeply in humanity's acceleration of global warming through wasteful practices. His documentary, An Inconvenient Truth, is also 100 minutes of mildly engaging Gore, a much improved model over the failed campaigner for president in 2000.The waffling comes now from the general population, almost evenly divided on the causes and remedies. On the liberal side, film critic Roger Ebert speaks plainly about being an advocate for Gore's warming campaign and this documentary: "In 39 years, I have never written these words in a movie review, but here they are: You owe it to yourself to see this film. If you do not, and you have grandchildren, you should explain to them why you decided not to." On the other side is The New York Post's Kyle Smith: "But there is wide disagreement about whether humans are causing global warming (climate change preceded the invention of the Escalade) and about whether we should be worried about the trends. Look carefully at Gore's charts and you'll see that the worst horrors take place in the future of his imagination." Gore does have convincing moments despite this skepticism. He says: "There is no controversy about these facts. Out of 925 recent articles in peer-review scientific journals about global warming, there was no disagreement. Zero." This almost irrefutable statement is substantiated by photos of earth before and after showing retreating shorelines and shrinking glaciers among other depressing images so well known they are almost certainly untouched.The subtext of this smartly-crafted doc is whether or not Al Gore can be a viable candidate in 2008. The more salient question is whether the planet will survive that long to let him try to do what he couldn't in eight years as vice president: Halt the relentless warming of the planet.</fullReview>

This was a very eye opening documentary and pretty much shows you a global warming problem that is increasing so rapidly, it will bite you in the butt in years to come, especially future generations. It's actually crazy to see what we are doing to our planet. Global warming is like a silent killer and this documentary shows charts, graphs, images, and forecasts of what will happen if we don't change our ways.

		<shortDescription>The Best Disaster Film Ever Made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"An Inconvenient Truth" is the best disaster movie ever made as well as the most frightening horror film ever. This film should be required viewing for every citizen of the planet.In my estimation, global warming is a clear and present danger and one that threatens the future of planet earth. It is true that the planet goes through natural cycles of climate change, but it would certainly appear that human beings are having an unnatural impact on those changes. The facts as presented in this film seem undeniable.While the film is indeed alarming, it is also hopeful for it refers to global climate problems that we have largely conquered such as CFC emissions. It also tells us what each of us can do to reduce our personal contributions to CO2 emissions. Now if we can all just apply pressure to the politicians and the large corporations to summon the political will and the capital to do what they can to reduce CO2 emissions we can make some real progress in combating this problem. It's not too late for planet earth!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Who knew that the oxygen content of our air is a matter of national security? Gore presents evidence that's never been made available to the general public before, and it is convincing. What's also impressive is that Gore has personally traveled to many of the hot spots where global warming is evident. This is a man who cares about his cause. Yes, it's a one-man documentary, but it's far from dull, and the implications raised are alarming. If, by the end of the film, you still don't believe that our planet is in crisis, you must be one of those who prefer the pseudo-science of (un)intelligent design.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a political masterpiece for Al Gore. A clever film that puts the ex-vice-president right back into the front &amp; center of American thought and discussion.However, regardless of whether you're on the left or right side of the political fence, or whether you admire or ridicule Al Gore, this documentary compellingly shows how the planet IS warming, what the effects have been to date, and what WILL occur if things carry on in this direction.The movie runs through plenty of charts showing CO2 levels, temperature levels, and so on over the last 100 - 100,000 years, and leaves no doubt about it... things are now well beyond the standard cyclical changes! Human civilization is changing the atmosphere, and pictures of receding glaciers, evidence of dying reefs, and melting ice-shelves drive home the point.There are a scattering of jibes at the existing administration, and plenty of jokes that will have democrats laughing, but this is not a Michael Moore, agitate the loony-left movie. It comes across as a poignant sensible update on our place in the world which leaves one wanting to drive less, turn the lights off, and find ways to minimize our impact on the world we live in.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A compelling and interesting presentation but the film doesn't help itself with side issues that only divide the audience unnecessarily</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Taking the form of a documentary, the former next President Al Gore presents his PowerPoint presentation on the issues of climate change and global warming. Taking a light hearted but data-based approach to the issue, Gore makes an accessible and compelling case.By the tone of my plot summary I suppose my politics are clear and indeed those that know me beyond my username will contest that my training and career to date is within the field of industrial environmental management. So in a way I was the converted in this subject but it is not to say that I am in some way perfect ? like many of the "converted" I tend to believe the theory intellectually but not to the degree where I decide that I have no option to alter my lifestyle (as I write I am a few weeks from several transatlantic flights for work and pleasure). So if you count me as the converted then perhaps it is no bad thing that this film will be mainly preaching to the converted. It is a shame that it does this because, although the material does do this by its very nature, the film doesn't help itself by introducing other factors that split the audience unnecessarily.By this I am specifically thinking of the personality that is Gore. When he is delivering his PowerPoint presentation and building his message on a strong bed of graphs and data he is compelling and the viewer is only faced with agreeing or disagreeing with his "facts". However in other sections we see personal reflections of Gore and also footage from his 2000 election "defeat". Such additions do not help the central debate much but rather they introduce divisive material into an already controversial topic ? a factor that the film didn't need if it is trying to win people over. These things aside though, if we focus on the film as Gore's presentation, it is a compelling and engaging film. I did not totally agree with all of his points and I had the odd "yeah but" thought at certain times but mostly the volume and degree of his presentation is hard to totally counter. I liked the way he brought the common sceptical arguments into his presentation and rather than just dismissing them of ten built a case around them and let the audience reaction tell him that he had done enough.Of course to the sceptics this film will be one they dismiss in the same way that they dismiss many other statements on climate change but this was to be expected. OK, so the film turns off some other audience sectors along political lines that it didn't need to do (or could have worked to minimise) but generally this is strong enough as a film that it should grab some casual viewers and get them thinking ? which is of course a good thing. An engaging and compelling presentation then (documentary is probably not the right description) that concludes with a nice touch of making suggestions (national and individual) rather than leaving us with just a bleak message to deal with.</fullReview>

This film provides indisputable evidence that global warming is fact not fiction. Quite simply; if more serious measures are not taken quickly, then the world we know will be a distant memory.This documentary follows ex vice president Al Gore as he travels the globe giving an informative presentation on the global warming issue. While the focus is on his presentations, Gore also narrates the story about how he first found out about this topic back in his high school days. For those who think this is a political platform of an angry ex presidential candidate, you are sorely mistaken. The film ends up being more like a public service announcement not just to our government, but to all of earth's people. This film should be required viewing for all ages.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've always considered myself in the know about major issues, but I've never seen so much irrefutable evidence on climate change assembled together as in this movie, and I feel enlightened by it. I have a newfound respect for Al Gore, and I appreciate the unassuming tone of the movie. Like the great book "Fast Food Nation", this movie simply rolls out fact after fact, and lets them speak for themselves without getting into opinions. Opinions would only help if there were gaps in information, leaps of faith needed to cross those gaps - in the subject matter of this movie there are no such gaps. Scientists by their nature are usually averse to speaking in platitudes and certainties, which unfortunately puts their conclusions at a disadvantage versus whatever flavor of the week opinion is being propounded by the slick and unscrupulous media. This is one major issue where everybody's got to get their heads out of the sand. We can all do little things that together will contribute greatly to protecting the sustainability of our existence.</fullReview>

It is a fact that within 50 years this world will be so hot that it will be unbearable to live for human beings. Global Warming causes a whole bunch of disasters and problems mentioned in this documentary. There are signs around us everyday. Just that we are not aware of it because it is not right next to our homes. But the Earth is trying to warn us. Maybe someday technology will catch up and save us all. But until that happens we can't deny the fact that this Earth is dying everyday at a rapid speed. It is not little by little anymore. It's like a high speed train which will hit us in the near future. I think this documentary really needs to be shown to more people and politicians should stop being so ignorant and realize what is most important to us.

		<shortDescription>"In America, Political Will Is A Renewable Resource." --- Al Gore</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"An Inconvenient Truth" (2006) Directed By: Davis Guggenheim Narrated By: Al Gore MPAA Rating: "PG" (for mild thematic elements) "In 39 years, I have never written these words in a movie review, but here they are: You owe it to yourself to see this film. If you do not, and you have grandchildren, you should explain to them why you decided not to." --- Roger Ebert In His Review Of "An Inconvenient Truth".I begin my review of "An Inconvenient Truth" with what I believe is one of the best quotes to have been written about this documentary, because it sums up my opinion as well. I watched this movie in a state of stunned silence, unable to take my eyes away. Sometimes, I believe, the world just needs a slap in the face for action to occur. Global Warming is a very real issue and it is happening every minute of every day. It is happening around us?and we are causing it. This is unacceptable and having this knowledge is something we must deal with. The title, "An Inconvenient Truth", says it all. Global Warming is true and we certainly know about it?but it is considered to be too inconvenient to deal with. Why bother with ensuring a safe world for our grandchildren?when it does not affect us at this very moment in time?Al Gore, one of the most recognized politicians alive today (due mainly to his unsuccessful run for President in 2000), has had a deep interest in the issue of Global Warming for quite some time. "An Inconvenient Truth" is, therefore, his pet project. It is an informative look at what caused the issue of Global Warming, the effects brought on by it, and what we can do to help. Weaved into Gore's lengthy lecture on the subject is a few highlighted moments from Gore's personal life. It is not merely a documentary. It is a plea for worldwide change and a cry for protection of Planet Earth, not just a sphere floating in space--our home. "It is now clear that we face a deepening global climate crisis that requires us to act boldly, quickly, and wisely," Gore stated?and he is right. If we want our grandchildren to have the chance to live in the world that we know, something must be done. We don't have much time anymore."You can't make somebody understand something if their salary depends upon them not understanding it." --- A Statement By Al Gore, Quoting Upton Sinclair.Al Gore, who introduces himself with a sly, "I'm Al Gore, I used to be the next president of the United States of America", is probably best known for being a rather dull man?not a bad man, not a bad politician, but one who really never elicits much excitement. In "An Inconvenient Truth", he remains that same way and, though most people will merely want to shrug this off as being boring and bland (after all, it is Al Gore discussing the world), this movie is anything but boring. It is an enthralling documentary, not because of Gore, but because of the message he is bringing. Using creative and compelling ways to share this information (I found the "Futurama" clip to be the most inventive), Gore keeps this movie intriguing and interesting."An Inconvenient Truth" is probably the most famous documentary released since "Fahrenheit 9/11" (with its only serious competitor being "This Film Is Not Yet Rated") and I certainly hope that its fame leads into some serious change on behalf of the world's populations and governments. Al Gore puts aside his political beliefs (okay, so most of them) for the sake of this cause and it is time that our world leaders do the same thing. Who cares if we disagree politically with another country? As Gore states, this is not a political issue. It is a moral issue. We cannot afford to let this go by unchecked. On the downside, this documentary did slag a little bit and there were a few scenes that probably could have been deleted altogether. However, "An Inconvenient Truth" is probably the best documentary of the year and the most important movie you will see all year.Final Thought: "An Inconvenient Truth" is the slap in the face that the world needs.Overall Rating: 10/10 (A+)</fullReview>

You have to see it, Al Gore is great here. As you may know the film is about the phenomenon known as "Global warming". Heard it before...? I thought so. The former vice president of the United States informs us viewers about the HUGE problem and at the same time proves that those who actually still thinks this is just something that will pass - while we calmly sit and watch - are totally and incredibly wrong! We are the major reason for this crisis and we are the ones that have to correct it. This is not a movie based on opinions and feelings, it's a movie based on true facts folks. True heart-clenching facts. It's a film full of diagrams and scientific research, but it is told in a simple and touching way. I myself have never though much about global warming, but this has made me realize where we stand right now. How big this problem really is, and that we have to do something right NOW!And just remember, everyone can do something, and every step leads somewhere... This is just a brilliant film!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You Won't Doubt Global Warming After This Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a movie showing Al Gore presenting a slide-show about global warming. For more excitement, he throws in some videos, cartoons and background footage on his life growing up in Tennessee.First, let me say I expect Al Gore to be boring. I love Gore, I voted for him in 2000, but he does come across as really dry and there's not much I thought could be done about that. But he comes across here as being warm, thoughtful and sometimes fairly humorous. This film will change your opinion of Al Gore and show you why he is fast becoming a celebrity in his own right.Second, if you doubt global warming or that humans are behind it, watch this movie. I was under the impression that global warming was largely natural and that humans only affected the Earth marginally. Well, the science in this video really put things in a way I couldn't deny or argue with. Global warming is real, and it is very dangerous. And some day, people will look back and say "Al Gore, you are super awesome."Many people, myself included, have seen the parodies done by "South Park" or heard people's reactions to the film (including George Bush's refusal to see it) but had not actually watched the movie. It's not bad! In fact, it's great, and if it does not win the Oscar for best documentary I will be really surprised.What more can I say? Rent this film, or even buy it, because you're going to want to show your friends. The person I watched it with was already watching for her third time. And she would gladly watch it again and again. So would I. It has a logic you just cannot refute. And it has clips from "Futurama", so that can't be bad.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In a matter of speaking the documentary "An Inconvenient Truth" presents the facts and figures behind the Hollywood machine's disaster flick "The Day After Tomorrow". However, this film is far more frightening and unsettling than any fright flick Tinseltown can toss out. It reveals clearly and concisely the effects global warming has had on our planet over time, and especially over the past thirty years since Al Gore first learned of it. The film focuses much of it's time on several of Gore's many speaking engagements he has done on the volatile subject, and his deep involvement in trying to get the word out about our planetary ticking time bomb. A bit of time is put forth examining Gore's personality, upbringing and devotion to this cause, which helps to humble him to those only familiar with his political face. Thanks to the recent acceptance of documentaries as a form of mainstream film-making, hopefully this call to action film will be seen by enough persuaded viewers to change course.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To be clear up front. I am a left-leaning conservative. I'm not ultra right, but I would not be considered a liberal by any means. I say this to say to everyone out there to please watch this movie regardless of your prior convictions about Al Gore. This movie, which I would hesitantly call a documentary (more about that later), tells the tale of the emerging problem with CO2 emissions and the possible outcomes and effects. Some of the devices used to promote these changes are a bit suspect to me...like showing pictures of old post cards and modern pictures with no real way of knowing if the original was in a different season or an uncommonly snowy year. But the hard facts are still there for all to plainly see. This is a growing problem. The movie doesn't try to lock us into paranoia but gives us simple things that we can do to make a difference.I appreciated Al Gore's personal candor about the reasons he has to tell this story, his journey into this issue, and his personal Growth. I hesitate to call it a documentary as it was definitely made with one purpose in mind, is mostly an informational dump, and fails to accurately delve into the other side of things when presented with options. But it doesn't really need to and that wasn't the point. I would call this an editorial or opinion piece more than a documentary.Regardless of prior convictions, personal beliefs, etc please go see this film and make some of the minor changes required to make a difference.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Nutshell Review: An Inconvenient Truth</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"You can't make somebody understand something if their salary depends upon them not understanding it." - Upton SinclairNow if there's a story that's terrifying, An Inconvenient Truth is more horrifying that the recent slew of horror and disaster films out there, because, if you buy the message, this is true, and what's happening right here right now. We can't escape the consequences if we continue doing what we do to harm Nature, but yet we still have the power and ability to make a difference.Sounds simplistic? Well, maybe. Then again, cynicism will not help any bit. An Inconvenient Truth is a documentary, touching on the very issues of our survival and existence on this only planet we call Earth, the only one we can call home. Al Gore, used to be the next president of the United States, or could be if going by popular vote, brings to us, on the big screen with the assistance of director Davis Guggenheim, an issue he holds dearly, as seen in his relentless crusade around the world, to spread the message that the Earth is sending out SOSes, and we need to respond.The issue of global warming, and the cranky weather and natural disasters we are facing of late, is nothing new. But perhaps, in about 100 minutes, here is something, a presentation that hits home, that summarizes succinctly all the cause and effects, the whys and the how tos. Filled with charts, facts and figures, and lively animation, these are but some of the techniques Gore uses in his slideshow presentation to ring home the message. In fact, I would say it's an excellent package put together for presentation, and anyone could take away a tip or two, on effective public speaking.To some, the documentary is a no-brainer to put together, as most of it focuses on Gore delivering his message, as if you were there listening to him from the stage floor. True, the setup might not be impressive, but the message is too engaging for you to realize that it might be a little bit lazy in the film-making aspects. Having said that, it's precisely jazzier styles were not adopted to keep the attention on the message instead.And keep to the message it does, with just little time on the outside of what Gore does on his travels, some little glimpses into his family life, life before, during and after the close-call year 2000 presidential elections. You do wonder though, about the what-ifs, should he had won the elections, and what difference he would have made on these issues when in the White House.It is clear that modern civilization has an increasing negative impact on the environment, and with the mega developing countries seeking its path to economic equity, one would only shudder at how much more damage could be done, and the devastating after effects. Politics usually steer clear of issues like these, and instead, picks and chooses battles with a higher confidence of success. It's sad, but true.The funniest part about this, and I'd bet during any screening, is whether anyone will buy into what was being delivered. There are tips handed out during the end credits, on how individuals like you and me could help do our part to save the environment. They aren't huge projects, but very simple ones. And no prizes for guessing there are many uninterested, heading straight for the door when the credits start to roll."It ain't what you don't know that gets you into trouble. It's what you know for sure that just ain't so." - Mark Twain</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's beyond my comprehension that so many people can hide their heads in the sand when it comes to this film. Whether the film is itself engaging isn't the issue. With documentaries we need to look to the content as much as the film-making. The fact of the matter is that energy is finite. The key is when you want to use it up. The universe continues in a pattern of neutralization which eventually leads to a centering. This process will take billions of years for the universe. On our earth we have much less time. I really get a kick out of people who talk about how we should quite scaring people. We ought to be scared. I have a young son who will have children before too long. What's in it for his grandchildren? The other night I heard of a major oil find in the gulf, one of the largest located. If it becomes a good source do you want to guess how long it will last. The U.S. would use it up in two years. What's the first thing some do when faced with the realities of climate change. They find one scientist out of 5000 who disagrees and say, "See. It was all made up." This film is just one in a series of documents that have the same conclusion. Quit looking at it as political. Otherwise, crank up your three SUV's and burn up the precious fuel we have left and forget about your grandchildren.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An Inconvenient Truth is a great movie. I believe it should be compulsory viewing for all Australians. I was most impressed with Al Gore. For me his priorities are spot on.Australia is one of the driest places in the world. I identified with Al Gore's background and his relationship with the land. Watching water supplies diminish and productive land becoming less productive is devastating. I think many people in Australia have experienced this.The optimism in the movie was encouraging and it was good to be reminded that the ozone layer problem seems to have been solved.The movie is thought provoking and offers solutions to a situation that is becoming more desperate throughout the world.The US is so powerful! It is vital that it addresses the issues raised in the movie. I hope that Al Gore is able to influence environmental decisions in the US. Unfortunately Australia seems to blindly follow US decisions and it was terrible to see Australia and US as two of the countries that do not participate in the Kyoto Agreement.If only Al Gore had been elected President! The world would be a much better place.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If the American voting public had seen this Al Gore in 1999 I believe that recent world history would have changed. This film impressed me by Mr. Gore's sincerity and concern for all of our futures. It pointed out the folly of our current way of life and the real dangers that we, and future generations, face if we don't change our ways. At the same time it offered us hope by challenging us to save ourselves and our children by relatively simple changes in our life styles and by demanding that our elected representatives and industry and commerce take global warming seriously. I hope that every citizen and certainly every student from grade 7 and up see this film. As a retired College Prof. I was very impressed with Mr. Gore's presentation.

Its about time that an advocate of saving energy and trying to stop the planet from boiling us alive took the story to the mainstream.I have a lot of respect for this man and am heartily saddened by the fact he so narrowly missed out on becoming the President of the USA. If only someone in power like that had Al Gore's foresight and conviction, the world would, I'm sure be a happier and safer place. It would be a happier and safer place without George W in the driving seat anyway but the difference in attitude between these two is incredible. Shame on you America. Having said that however there is surprisingly little political comment in the film only cold hard facts and figures to get every one thinking. It should be shown to every schoolchild before they join the rat race and the world of commerce and industry.

		<shortDescription>Eco-Apocalypse and the Power Point Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Al Gore's An Inconvenient Truth may get the honor of being the first widely distributed PowerPoint film (apologies to David Byrne), based on the Microsoft PowerPoint software that has become popular for professional and public speaking all over the world. The film breaks new generic, production, and rhetorical ground.While many critics call it a documentary, it is a generic hybrid: part PowerPoint public-speaking tour de force, part jeremiad, part documentary, part potential campaign film. Most of all, An Inconvenient Truth is a strong piece of political persuasion that begs to be critically evaluated on those terms.What is this film trying to do? As a piece of pedagogical rhetoric (by which I mean not deceptive speech but well-considered, ethical persuasive discourse), the film seeks to inform and move its audience to action. [...]It is hard to deny that the PowerPoint form of the film makes otherwise very abstract points and arguments seemingly concrete. This is because, as with water levels rising and taking over Greenland and Florida or with polar bears drowning after having to swim longer distances to scarce icebergs, the points are visualized. This is very important. The visual and oral today are gargantuan in terms of public address after the hegemony of print. People can read all they want about global warming, melting ice caps, Florida covered with water, and polar bears drowning, but it doesn't hit them the way a clip art-animated polar bear foundering in the waves does. Voice-overs and soundtrack compound the emotional effects and direct the attention. And the fact is that fewer and fewer Americans are reading newspapers and magazines, where writers can use the space to elaborate arguments with testimonies of authorities, statistical findings of scientific studies, in a descriptive and engaging style. But the art of the story here, somewhat sensationalistic and true to its generic precedents, is what can be easily overlooked due to Gore's seemingly nerdy PowerPoint style and disarmingly populist appeals. The film's studied shots and soundtrack cunningly punctuate the narrative for the viewer. Narrative? One might not think of a PowerPoint presentation as a story. Isn't it just a lecture about global warming after all? Not at all. It is a story of blind human extravagance, selfishness, political machinations, and hubris that hearkens back to the jeremiad literary and preacher style. Sort of. The brilliance of Gore's style of address is that it is never that of preaching or intimidating. One never feels like one is watching footage of the Nuremburg rally or a Pat Robertson sermon, or an episode of The O'Reilly Factor. Gore is avuncular. Like a campaign film, this film celebrates Al Gore as one with the viewer/the people, a necessary connection in inspiring change. An Inconvenient Truth is full of overtures to the viewer for identification. In the film's style, Al Gore is not some elite nerd-politician who reads environmental science journals full of gobbledygook. Nor will he put social security in a lockbox. He's the gentle and semi-hip guy who was "once the next president of the United States," successful for Saturday Night Live and Futurama audiences as well as for those watching his PowerPoint presentation. We are asked to identify with him as celebrity and human being: the man who was to be president, who lost his sister to cancer, who nearly lost his son, and who is then moved to value the preciousness of life and therefore the colossal threat of global warming. Gore gently traces the history of his own understanding of the problem to the influence of a teacher he once had. In this way, the film is a kind of subtle argumentation by analogy, whose success rests on the viewer's desire to identify with Gore. At other times, Gore's populist overtures have nothing to do with global warming, as when he is mounting a kind of hydraulic lift, not unlike those used by telephone and cable line workers, ironically for a ride up higher from which he will point to a map as he lectures to the audience gazing from below. He addresses the audience with something like, "I don't know any better than you how these things work." There are close-ups and mid-shots of Gore heroically at work on his laptop, tracking down the forces of environmental evil at work in Washington politics and the global economy. This gives the story elements of intrigue that are raised and dropped but have the function of allowing Gore to look like George Clooney in Syriana for twenty seconds. To be sure, Gore's overtures for identification are often highly emotional and in the form of barely perceptible analogies. Through the story of his sister who died of cigarette-related cancer, he makes the analogy that global warming is just such a silent killer to which we must awaken before its cancer is beyond treatment. The analogy extends further in that his family had been tobacco growers but made the difficult choice to change their lives and stop growing the problematic herb; so we are encouraged to stop our many self-destructive behaviors and save the world. Again, I think such emotional touches are necessary. And this is about saving the world. The narrative is also cunning and classical in that sense. Three-fourths of An Inconvenient Truth is developing a problem, trying to move the audience first to believe and feel that there is a sense of doom. Graph projections of pollution, ice melting, sea levels rising, and so on move irrevocably into an abstract but somehow visualized apocalpyse. It is the Ghosts of Christmas Past speaking to Scrooge, showing him the future, moving him to act differently here and now. "Save yourself!" is the implication. .... continue at http://www.brightlightsfilm.com/53/gore.htm</fullReview>

In a time where the average American film is full of teenagers in high school its nice to see a documentary like this come out of the US. don't get me wrong, I do like those average American films, but this was a refreshing change. I had my doubts about going to see it. I wasn't sure of the format and I was not sure as to how genuine Al Gore would come across but I was pleasantly surprised. He has a great screen presence and when he talks, you listen. I thought it might be a bit long and perhaps a trifle boring the way the topic of global warming is generally presented by the news but it was actually quite humorous, Al Gore knows what he's talking about and the information is presented well and with great continuity. Plus the cuts between his lecture and his own thoughts and reminisces of his childhood was incredibly well done and made for an entertaining though provoking film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disturbing Clarity, Short on Solution</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gore is a deft, knowledgeable, and definitively concerned presentation artist whose message here, imparted with disturbing clarity, implies that nothing short of a kick in the pants is deserved of those who sit idle whilst their children's futures go wasted due to self-gratifying distraction and unforgivable negligence. In short, see the film and then...do something.Unfortunately the solutions presented here come up short on realism. Most, though well-meaning, will simply go forward waiting for someone else to "fix it". About the only thing that would immediately stir the masses from their drifting daily reverie is a swift punch in the pocketbook, let's say, $15 per gallon gasoline. Something of this ilk couldn't help but initiate a constituent-fueled, government-implemented, sustainable/alternative energy program that would make the Apollo program look like Aunt Sophie's sewing circle -- oil oligarchy be damned.

		<shortDescription>Hats off to Al Gore</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A brief explanation ? I did not intend to go see this movie, I was waiting for it to hit the video stores. Michael Moore's last two releases being an exception, I rarely buy tickets to see documentaries. In fact, I was going to see Superman Returns, in IMAX. The film started out fine, but thanks to the dreadful heat wave that hit New York last week, the air conditioning was turned up as high as it could go in the huge theater, and five minutes into Superman the power went out. I received tickets to go to any movie that I wanted, and the only thing that was on was this ? Al Gore's film about Global Warming. The simple truth of it is, if it wasn't for the effects of Global Warming, I never would have gone and seen this film. Do you think Mr. Gore would have appreciated the irony? Hats off to Mr. Gore. Gore did not, like so many other failed presidential candidates, let himself be tossed into the trash can of politics; and rather than being content with entering the history books as The Man Who Was Almost President ? and let's face it, his loss was particularly painful and controversial as elections go ? he found an agenda that is close to his heart and pursues it with all his might. Despite what some Bush-ists might tell you, this is not a Gore propaganda movie; the 2000 elections are referred to very briefly, and he does not linger on it. Instead, he precisely and strongly makes his point. And a good point it is.An Inconvenient Truth is a wake up call, and it draws attention to a subject that is not generally given remotely enough attention. The United States all too often pokes its nose so deeply into the problems of the whole world, it fails to see the problems at home; the statistics that Gore reveals are staggering and worrying, and it's time somebody took the issue seriously. Is the film biased, are the statistics at times treated in a less than objective manner? Does Gore use at times emotional manipulation to help make himself heard? The answers to these questions are yes. And if that's what it takes, I'm all for it. You might also argue that Gore gives the viewers very little practical advice of what they can actually do to solve the problem. That's true. The sad truth is, an individual can do very little to actually change this frightening reality. But if with this film Gore succeeds, little by little, to raise awareness to the problem and to make just a few more people care and think about it, then little by little it will get better. Eventually, maybe enough people will care that someone in a position of power takes notice, too. If that happens, the film did its job.An Inconvenient Truth is hardly fun, but I honestly think everyone should watch it. Take no heed of the closed-minded people who say that Gore is dull, charmless or pretentious; he is in fact a highly skilled speaker, incredibly intelligent, with bags of charisma, and also, you'll be amazed, a great sense of humor. I had only two regrets while watching the film: one was that I could not ask Gore any questions ? his speech drew me in so deeply. The second was that this man did not become president. I have a hunch we'd all have been better off.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An Inconvenient Truth is based on the presentation on the global climate change that Al Gore has traveling the world delivering. This film is an excellent source of information on global warming. All the information in this film is politically objective and scientifically backed by literally thousands years of research. Al Gore not only presents a well researched documented case showing the current effects of global warming, but he also addresses the potential effects. Al Gore explains global warming in an interesting easy to understand manner. The film addressed a little of Al Gore's life and how he became interested in global warming. Al Gore is passionate about this subject, and his level of commitment is inspiring. He discuses the myths and misconceptions that surround global warming like, that scientist are undecided about global warming. He not only addresses the problem, Gore encourages actions to prevent further damage. He gives solutions and options, a lot of the suggestions we can all do everyday.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having worked at the Environmental Protection Agency for many years, I wasn't unfamiliar with a lot of the material in this film, including the anecdote about the report EPA once sent to the Bush administration's Chief of Staff for Environmental Affairs, a former oil industry lobbyist who took it upon himself to edit out the Agency's conclusions about global warming as speculative theory before he released the report. Relatively minor quibbles about scientific methodology aside, that remains the main conservative objection to the overwhelming majority of the scientific community's concerns about global warming?since it can't be proved definitively that human activity is the cause of what might just a natural historical cycle of environmental climate change, nothing need be done. Which is sort of like saying, there's no actual videotape of anyone hacking a voting machine during a presidential election so it shouldn't be investigated, despite the fact that there is a lot of empirical data circumstantially pointing in that direction that can't be rationally explained away by simply refusing to examine it. And that is not an analogy I make lightly, because that issue haunts this documentary. During the beginning of the film I thought, oh no, too much irrelevant stuff about Al Gore's personal life and political career, this is going to be self-serving infotainment, but following the montage of media clips from the 2000 election, Gore's narration grows more involving as he describes the position in which he found himself, certainly not your Average Joe, but still a private citizen disenfranchised by insider political corruption, wondering how he can make a difference?hey, join the club, Al. But instead of yachting around with corrupt ex-presidents, he gets Brownie points for dusting off his PowerPoint presentation, loading it onto his Apple PowerBook and trudging around the world, trying to create an informed sense of community about important issues among the people that he meets, which in the end is all that any of us can do.</fullReview>

While that may be a pipe dream, perhaps viewers on both sides of the fence will see fit to follow at least some of the tips from the credits regardless of their personal beliefs...Can't hurt, right Right?Even if you think Global warming is a myth, or at best real but not our fault, there is no harm in walking, taking transit, using less electricity, etc. If you are right about climate change being a crock, then at worst you get some exercise and save some cash... if you are wrong on the other hand... Well, why not better safe than sorry?I don't understand why this is a debate at all when the solution to the problem is so easy to swallow and has so many benefits to us even not considering the impact on the climate.So non-believers, I ask you- why not "go green" anyway?

		<shortDescription>not a political issue, but for the sake of our survival</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Above all, what we should learn from "An Inconvenient Truth" is that preserving the planet is not, as Bush would have us believe, a political debate; it's a moral issue. The very fact that Bush didn't respond to it shows how out of touch with reality he is. I just would like to ask, as Al Gore does, what has to happen before there is any meaningful action to curb global warming.In parts of the movie, I wonder if Gore went a little overboard in trying to humanize himself by telling about his childhood. But he has more of an excuse to than Bush ever will. I was surprised to learn that the US can't sell it's cars in China. I wouldn't be surprised if GM and Ford have to get bought by Japanese companies.But back to the main point. I know that skeptics will try to present data showing various warming trends throughout history, but if they try to deny the data that Gore shows, I must wonder why they don't care about humanity. As Gore notes, with serious action, we can get warming below the 1970 level. But we don't have much time left. All in all, as Roger Ebert noted: you owe it to yourself to see this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie comes highly recommended!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many years ago I came upon a book in a book store that introduced me to the issue of Global Warming and it gave me a great curiosity on the subject. Following this I read a number of books on the subject but at times found it difficult to maneuver through the facts. Many were written for those in the field of science and the jargon did not allow for a fluid understanding of the subject. Thanks to Al Gore, who spent many years pursuing the information, then many years fine tuning an explanation for teaching purposes, the general public can now absorb the information. The movie comes at you like a lecture in some ways, but a lecture by your favourite professor who is truly excited by what he teaches. Sprinkled in with the well organized information that is built up so you can absorb it, are mini clips of moments in Al Gore's life that reflect the events that pushed him in his mission to teach us what we need to know. I went to see the film with my husband and teenage son and we all enjoyed it to the point that we talked about it for a while after the film finished. My son was even wondering if he could recommend this film as a part of the curriculum at his high school for all students who reach an appropriate grade. I would highly recommend this film!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Finally saw this film .I saw the movie "In Invenenient Truth on the evening of Wednesday August 16..Now , I had read about the science and its implications long before.. I had accepted this as truth, before I saw it because, I read much, and a very good friend who was a science teacher told me about it, and it's truthfulness.. So, I believed this ahead of time , mainly because I trusted this friend for his honesty, and I have known him for over 35 years, he knew this subject, and wouldn't lie to me.. ..So seeing the movie, was somewhat anti-climatic. ..It is an impressive film, some excellent visuals, some humor, quite sobering, but one must ask three questions about it? A. Is the science presented factual? ..B. Is Gore a lier C. If Gore is a lier, Why?A. .I do believe the science is factual..Almost all independent climatologists who have examined these charts, pictures, and numbers, says what he is saying is truth.. ..A few studies say otherwise, but, if one looks at who is financing those studies,and who is paying those scientists, one finds those studies questioning the validity of Gore facts, are not independent, but financed by oil and coal interests..They obviously are not independent. They have something to lose.B. Is Gore a lier? Would he purposely lie about all of what he presents? While some of the film seems self serving, that is not important. Are the fact presented lies....If so, why? Spoilers ahead.... ...Gore presents his history, about the germination of his beliefs when he was a student at a university in the 60s. He names the professor who motivated him, shows the professor's research projected into our times, which has been proved correct, and he shows, his efforts later in Congress in the 80s to make the country aware of these ideas and efforts to change the laws (His efforts at that time failed)....If you watch the film, one gets the feeling this is not a new issue, but something that he believes in deeply, and would not lie about. More importantly, these beliefs are not new, but have developed in him over a 40 year period. . .... C....Let's assume he is a lier.Why? Why go to this much trouble to lie, and deceive everyone?...Does he think he can get away with it??Certainly after the films release, people would check his numbers, pictures,and charts and prove him completely wrong..I do not think that has happened.. ..His thesis is not, that "global warming is taking place." Everyone agrees that we are in a warming period. ..His thesis is that over the last 200 years," the rate of temperature is increase caused by recent human development,the results of the industrial revolution, .and population increases, is far greater than would normally exist. Also, this dramatic increase is caused by the increase in greenhouse gases, due to production of electricity, cars, etc. .. This rate is so much greater than it would normally be, that it actually threatens us all"... If he were indeed telling lies throughout, there would be rush to disprove every word in that movie.. This has not happened.There are many impressive photos, contrasts, charts, and graphs presented here. Clearly the most impressive chart was one shown that demonstrated the climatic changes over 650,000, years.. If you see this film, this particular chart, is really the key to his thesis, since it spans several ice ages, and takes into account the warming and cooling of earth without man, which has naturally occurred..and the warming that has occurred since man, and since the industrial revolution and the last l00 years., the last 50 and the last 10... ...The movie concludes with hope.This fact from the Associated Press appeared after the film was released into the theaters. I would like to add it in support of seeing this film...This story has been widely circulated,,,I suspect that it is not news, but is of interest to potential viewers of the film.By Associated Press Published July 14, 2006, 1:19 PM CDTWASHINGTON -- The first half of the year was the warmest on record for the United States.The government reported Friday that the average temperature for the 48 contiguous United States from January through June was 51.8 degrees Fahrenheit, or 3.4 degrees above average for the 20th century.That made it the warmest such period since record keeping began in 1895, the National Climatic Data Center reported.No state was cooler than average and five states -- Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, Nebraska, and Missouri -- experienced record warmth for the period.While much of the Northeast experienced extreme rainfall and flooding at the end of June many other areas continued below normal rain and snowfall.As of June, 45 percent of the contiguous U.S. was in moderate-to-extreme drought, an increase of 6 percent from May.Dry conditions spawned more than 50,000 wildfires, burning more than 3 million acres in the continental U.S., according to the National Interagency Fire Center.Worldwide, it was the sixth warmest year-to-date since record keeping began in 1880....I urge everyone to view this film..Decide for yourself the truthfulness of "The Inconvenient Truth." Soon it will be on DVD, you can rent it, and eventually you will be able to get it at the library for loan...Most libraries charge a dollar or less.. It is worth it, and the time spent watching it.... Even if you accept only some of this film, it is still worth seeing, because we need to ask ourselves this very important question.. ..."If the science in this film is truth, or has a reasonable chance of being the truth, then can we as humans afford to ignore it?" .................................................. ......................

		<fullReview>A documentary that is chilling in its facts and more 'warming', no pun intended, in its solutions to the biggest crisis on earth we have ever faced. Gore expands on a series of lectures he has given around the world for twenty years and is more humanized in this dry process by sharing with us how his life-project was formed originally on the family farm, nurtured in university and personalized by death of his sister from lung cancer (his family farmed tobacco) and the near-death of his six-year old son. Gore presents all the FACTS, and I bold-type it as some reviews I have seen dispute this glaring hard evidence, agreed upon by every scientist in the world and written about in every scientific journal for many years. Yes, Gore projects a catastrophic turn of events on a global scale if we don't pay attention (Katrina anyone?) but also tells us there are solutions and we can go this website to find them:http://www.climatecrisis.net/A ground breaking documentary with haunting images - melting north and south poles, ships mired forever in mud, the devastating news that never reaches MSM of the floods and deaths in India, China and Shangai.A must see for anyone concerned about the world that we have on loan from our grandchildren.And of course it is political - we need to engage more in the election process, have traceable, audited votes and responsible, truthful, accountable politicians.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Al Gore states that CO2 has risen, and has caused a rise in earth's temperature to the extent that changes have begun, changes that will become more pronounced in the near future. These changes, if allowed to continue on their current path, will result in tragic consequences. Thus is a believable statement, due to the evidence. Among the most prominent and simple evidence is that the 10 warmest years of planet earth, as measured by the average temperatures of the planet, have all been during the last 14 years. Simple. Anyone on this website that claims Mr. Gore's assertions are not believable are either uneducated or are motivated by other reasons. In the past, most of the world has been challenged to simply survive; put food on the table, put a roof over their head. However today, most people are no longer challenged this way. Instead, the majority of people will assume new challenges. One of which is to reduce CO2 emissions by making the necessary changes, both large and small, in our daily lives. Welcome to modern times. :) While it took millenia for the earth's population to grow to two billion, it has taken just a fraction of that time for the population to triple, to 6 billion. It will also take just a fraction of that time for it to grow to 12 billion. Just as people made changes to eliminate the earth's ozone problem, we can make global changes to reduce CO2 levels - and reduce the earth's temperature. plant a tree, increase vehicle m.p.h, reduce dependence on oil, use less electricity, etc, etc...www.plant3trees.compeace, out</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>In response to the ratings of "1"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Here's a logical thought: be suspicious of a dichotomous rating structure for a movie in this blog: the 1's versus the 10's. The division is all about a political reaction to the film (not the documentary itself). Quick gloss over the comments made by Al Gore suggests that he made this film for a-political purposes...while such intent is only known to him, most viewers will not regard the film in such an a-political light...(I for won started silk-screening my Gore in 2008 t-shirts - for sale on the corner of 21st and M streets) Politicizing this message is NOT a bad thing. The catastrophic message of global warming - supported by fact-based research and analogized anecdotes - would be compromised or at least corrupted by an a-political film. Numbers that reflect and abysmal last-place standing for the US on this issue suggest some mobilization and in that regard and I applaud the film's emphasis on morality over politics. Knowing the track records of past administrations, this could have been a trash-fest (especially at the expense of Mr. Bush, Jr. or Senior) Unfortunately, this film has limited release but see it if you can. I know my boyfriend and I felt good about riding to-and-from the theater on our bikes to see it -- and just streets away from 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. Incidentally, it's not like your $9 could go anywhere else worth while - Hollywood's movie-mill just keeps spinning out the same forgettable tripe anyway.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Even as far back as the 1970s we were being educated on the necessity of conservationism, or recycling, of working with our Earth instead of stripping it dry and naked. It seemed that then times would lead us as a nation to reevaluate our way of living and that we would act accordingly, but come the 1980s and Reaganomics, it all went to pot, and we as a nation forgot what the Seventies had begun to show us. We turned our backs on everything and began our rapid descent into the ME syndrome. Even with the advent of the ozone hole, or the need to be less dependent on oil, and look for other sources of energy (and granted, they're all out there, just waiting to be taken into use), we did nothing, and then we wonder why somehow rivers have dried up, why summers are hotter and come earlier, why winters come colder in some places or not at all in others, or why there are stronger hurricanes even in places where clearly there shouldn't be any. 2005 alone broke records in storms and hurricanes -- we hit the Greek alphabet, and several of the later storms went to places where normally they would be unheard of -- Africa and Europe. As someone who has lived in Dominican Republic I wasn't surprised to see the clear demarcation where one country ends and the other, poorer one -- Haiti -- begins. This demarcation is drawn from the dark green landscape on the Dominican side, as opposed to the barren side that is Haiti. (And then Haitians wonder why they are not wanted in Dominican Republic, but that's another story.) What hit me most were the numbers, the alarming rise in temperatures that seem not to affect us as much as the entire planet. Even though I was aware of some of the issues of global warming as early as the Seventies, it took Al Gore's documentary to really hit the message home. We're in trouble. Big, huge, frightening trouble. And the worse of it is, is that despite the promotion being given to AN INCONVENIENT TRUTH, people will still not do anything to help and only until something truly devastating happens will the media take action. The snows of Kilimanjaro will be only a memory shown in a movie because to look at it now, they're not there at all. Lake Chad is gone. The sheaths of ice are disappearing faster than we can blink, and it will only be time before the ocean levels start to rise, cover the entirety of Shanghai, India, Florida, and parts of New York City. Al Gore has been given major access to see the damage that we -- all of us -- have unleashed on the planet, and how he presents these statistics starts to unfold like one of the scariest horror movies I've ever seen: and on this note, this has to be one of the scariest documentaries ever because it's seeing the place we call home, standing on the edge of an abyss, as the populace gets the "reports" that deny what scientists have been barking at all along: that there's a 500 pound elephant in the room and no one is noticing it.At least Gore has enough faith in society -- and those who see his documentary -- in the fact that it will in one way or other react to the warning sign. I strongly believe that people should see this documentary, not once but many times until the message is clear enough that they will open their eyes and smell the toxic waste that will inevitably burn us where we least want it to. The reason is, I also strongly believe that there are parties that have their own invested interests in keeping the public blind as to facts that are real and facts that are manipulated. Thankfully, the public did react in time to reverse the hole in the ozone layer, so this might mean a return to basics and a less dependency on fossil fuels. Maybe the inflation of gas will force Americans into alternative modes of transportation -- it has to happen eventually, and it's better now than when there is nothing left.By the way, if you do go to the theatres and see this movie instead of the garbage that attempts to pose as blockbuster entertainment (which brings nothing to the table and numbs the brain into blubber), please stay after the end credits. There are great insights on how to take steps into helping the environment, how to act, and directs the viewer to Gore's site. This is the single most important movie you will need to see this year, or any year. And one that will make you think more about what surrounds you, and that the bad weather and flood occurring in somewhere remote may ultimately have a crippling effect on your own life.</fullReview>

Never in the least boring, the film presents the facts with compelling clarity and touches of humor.Furthermore, the call to action/let's change our ways orientation is a real plus. My demographic profile = middle class, middle aged, and, significantly, I have not had as much passion about environmental issues as I've had about other social causes. I sure do now!! If the "so what?" (or "what are the implications?" "what can I do?") questions are the ones that determine which documentaries are catalysts and ultimately classics, then this one couldn't possibly have succeeded more brilliantly. To wit: I am re-thinking my wasteful purchasing and transportation habits, I got a friend to consider dumping her SUV (by quoting the film incessantly), and just now sent a note to the 100 in my email file...

		<fullReview>Al Gore's involvement with the environment is at the center of this wonderful documentary directed by Dennis Guggenheim. The film is basically the lecture Mr. Gore has toured the world to point out the problems caused by men as our world is suffering from a series of catastrophic events that, in his view, could have been easily prevented, had governments paid a close attention to clues the scientific community has been pointing out for quite some time.Unfortunately, it appears that our country is one of the ones to be blamed the most for not controlling the hot gas emissions that are thrown into the atmosphere.The last sequence of the documentary is the most poignant one. We are shown how insignificantly small our own planet is in relation with the rest of the universe. Only watching it in the way it's presented in the film, some of us will be humbled in learning how small and vulnerable we are, which makes Mr. Gore's point to try to salvage our planet by whatever means we can.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>might be the greatest power-point presentation put on film this decade</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>And I say that opening summary line in saying that, perhaps, this isn't a perfect film. Al Gore, the would-be SHOULD be president (political views aside for now aside from that bit), tells some bits from his own stories here and there in the film as cut-aways from his slide-show presentation to his audience, and the bits are almost very interesting. Here and there these bits are even heartbreaking (seeing the replay of the 00 election, but also the story around his son's hospitalization). That they detract from the main trajectory of what the film is about is, I guess, just a way for the director to make it feel like a full movie. But that observation, if not outright criticism, aside this is one of those must-see movies if you care about, well, life really. While the film is not without putting some background on Gore and moments of his politics, 99% of the time he is really just a person relaying what is lacking in not just films and television but from other media sources- empirically backed facts that can only help and provide a basically 'scholarly' foundation for this case.And this case is not, of course, a bi-partisan kind of effort in spite of what some politicians and sadly uninformed skeptics would try to say. For those who may follow and believe already that, for example, the world is only 6000 years old and there were dinosaurs alongside us like in the Flintstones might be harder to convince on the outset anyway. But because the problem goes across party lines, and oceans, and mountains and glaciers, even over the poles, it does deserve attention on this medium. The main thrust behind Gore's global warming argument is presented in what would be basically just a power-point presentation, one of those where a click sends up the next image to get some contextualization. But the actual presentation itself is brilliantly put together to flow very well. It even starts with something very amusing with a cartoon from the Matt Groening world (whether its from Simpsons or Futurama I can't say). The context is mainly based on how global warming affects Co2, the oceans, the countless glaciers in the world, and how hurricanes, tornadoes and typhoons are all apart of this big ecological f***-up that could send the civilization to a stand-still within 100 years. I knew at least some things about what Gore was presenting, but the amount of facts that keeps piling as staggering as this is what sells the content completely. Sure, Gore is a politician, and who is to trust him any more than the average shlub? It's more than what he might stand for, even as he does present himself as well as he ever has on screen. The information here is bigger than he and us as viewers really are. And for anyone walking around in the Northern hemisphere surrounded by at least one of the catastrophes mentioned linked to global warming An Inconvinient Truth is a big zap of what could have come just as well from a scientist, and has, many times over (i.e. one big fact that interested me was that out of over 900 studies on the issue not one says that it is not from a human cause). Along with some of this shock of reality Gore does try to provide some hope with what can be done by people to stop at least some of what is going on. In a sense the real strength of the film is like in the strength of an academic research paper- an extraordinary one- where what can be proved is just as important if not more so than the results. That the film-making style that corresponds this is good in this corresponding slide-show way (and inventive here and there within a documentary aspect) is impressive.So run, don't drive (heh), to see this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"An Convenient Truth" in June 2006 is so far the Best Film of the Year. Exceptionally well researched and well executed in its depiction of Former Vice President Al Gore's mission to bring enlightenment to the issue of global warming. It is possibly the most important film of the 21st Century if it gets people to stop believing big oil, big business, or other politicians who claim their is a "debate" about whether global warning is occurring. I live in the San Franciso Bay Area and I may be underwater if Greenland and/or the Polar Ice Caps melt in substantial quantities. I can't swim very well and I won't allow the low intelligence smucks that buy into the horse manure the Bush Administration is shoveling on global warming that was his reason for not entering into the Kyoto Treaty, not increasing fuel efficiency for automobiles, and not committing to lowering CO2 emissions. All the Red States have to look at is the horrendous weather of 2005, the New Orleans Superdome after Katrina and the inability of the Bush Administration to handle the major human crisis to know who to believe on global warming. Tell your friends and everyone you know to watch this film and spread the word. It might be one of the most important things you do in your life.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is more than just another movie. This movie was life-changer for me. I thought I knew something about global warming, but this movie documents the URGENCY of the problem. (Notice the extreme weather conditions we are experiencing NOW?) People who live in the US have the power to change the direction of this threat to our environment, since we create more than half of the problem on earth, and the film outlines ways we can do this without much pain. Have national standards and buy cars that get the most miles per gallon; see Japan and China standards vs. US standards. Build wind farms for power instead of burning oil or coal. Recycle. Etc. These are not new ideas. We simply have to take them seriously and do our part. If we don't, in 10 years huge changes will already occur, which may be irreversible. If we don't solve this problem, we can forget about all the others, such as war and famine; we are simply rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic. Saying there is too much of Al Gore in this movie is a red herring. Listen to the message, don't disparage the messenger.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The take-away is simple...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>... and it's this: If the data presented in the movie holds up, we are in trouble. All of us. Republican, Democrat, Baptist, Atheist, Muslim. Deep trouble. And not the kind of trouble that will hit some abstract future generation that may or may not be around when things go south. If you don't plan on leaving this existence in the next few decades, then you are concerned. Personally.So really the relevance of this movie depends on whether that data holds up. For the uninitiated but critical viewer, it is very difficult to get a feeling for how solid the presented evidence really is. There is only so much a movie can do on this front, but I suppose it does not help that much of the movie shows Gore giving a slide-based presentation, which compounds the effects of two media (slide show and moving pictures), both of which are rather hostile to the presentation of facts. This would be its main flaw, in my view.But perhaps one should see the movie as an appetizer, as motivating people to dig into the subject, rather than as a complete education about it. Here, it actually does a pretty good job. It raises many of the issues, addresses many of the objections, and presents a lot of the supporting evidence. It shows Gore giving his spiel, and he turns out to be a pretty decent public speaker. He is shown as someone who feels strongly about this subject, and who makes no small personal investment in spreading what he considers to be the truth. There are some personal interest sidebars that focus on parts of his life more or less relevant to the topic or Gore's involvement in it.All in all an very watchable movie about a very relevant topic. My preference would have been for a documentary that spends a little more time with the facts and the various footnotes and caveats that one needs to be aware of when interpreting them. But even as it stands, it is a film that will contribute considerably to an important discussion, and likely become one of the standard references people will cite when talking about this issue outside of academia.</fullReview>

And though I already feel passionately about the subject matter, I was really impressed with both how clearly and convincingly the information is presented and how enjoyable it is as a documentary. I had heard beforehand that this film was about a power-point presentation, and it is, but it's also a pretty emotional picture about a man who has devoted his life to deliver an important message.I think everyone in America should see this film. (I should say here that I was born in Texas and lived there for 25 years.) Unlike Fahrenheit 911, this is not a piece of polemic but a presentation of the available scientific information that is cleverly paralleled with the sometimes tragic life of a politician. It becomes obvious by the end of the film that to tell some of the more significant facts about climate change it is necessary to have an hour and a half to spell out what it is and what is at stake. Sadly, global warming is still being 'debated' in the US. I would urge people of all political persuasions to go and see it for themselves, it's a very moving film and ultimately a very important one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>No other film I've seen in my lifetime calls the viewer to reevaluate their thinking and personal priorities. An Inconvenient Truth casts in stark relief the very real plight the human race faces IN OUR LIFETIME! Al Gore is simply the messenger in this story and this message should transcend partisanship. The real story of this film is not Gore but rather the drastic changes in climate in just the last 20 years. Gore articulates from every angle how mother nature is slapping us in the face begging us to wake up. 9/11 was terrible and terrorism should be a serious concern but a real weapon of mass destruction is headed our way that will dwarf the loss of that tragic day. No I'm not going to say that anyone who voted for the Bush administration has unwittingly signed the death warrant of their grandchildren but the Republican Party simply must make radical changes to their environmental platform. I reiterate this is everyone's problem. Al Gore's mission here is to illustrate that we're not talking about the abstract here. This is not something that we will be forced to address 100 years from now. This problem is immediate. Tsunami's, hurricanes, fires and floods are just the beginning. Now as a film An Inconvenient Truth could have been unbearable with it's grim message but Gore offers a ray of hope that change is possible through technology and political will. American's bear the lion's share of this responsibility as our co2 output far surpasses other countries'. This means that you as an American voter has been empowered to quite literally save the planet. I urge everyone to explore their Rep's environmental record and vote accordingly. The writing is on the wall will someone please read it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To be honest, I hadn't really spent much time following AL GORE's career path since he lost the election to the big W. I guess in some way I always distrusted him, but ironically it was because of Tipper... and her short-lived music censorship plans of the 90s. I can also vaguely recall the big hullabaloo the media made over Al's new "mysterious beard" look a while back. But then again, I hold the media in the same high regard as I do the latest administration. But then I caught the latest WIRED Magazine issue where there is a neat article about his upcoming film release... and an insightful interview with the ex-vice president himself, along with the new environmental order being directed by consumers. My interest was piqued. Today, my wife and I went to our little cineplex in Manhattan Beach and watched the documentary... AN INCONVENIENT TRUTH. From a cinematic perspective, this gem will not win any artistic merits. But that in essence is the charm of the film. Simple, and to the point. And powerful. Both of us came away very impressed with Mr. Gore, his vision, and his slide show (as he likes to call his very compelling presentation*). BTW, at least 80% of the running time of this documentary is watching Al present his slide show in front of several live audiences. See this movie and prepare to be informed. This is not the hack work our pal Michael Moore likes to produce with sleight-of-hand and editing magic. No, Mr. Gore deals in hard facts and delivers what may be one of the best politically-charged documentaries ever... presented in a straight-forward style, without resorting to name calling or buffoonery... like the aforementioned auteur. This film makes me proud to know there are still American leaders you can look up to in this country. I won't hold anything against the man any longer. Hell, not even Tipper. *His "slide show" was created on a Mac, using their fantastic presentation application called Keynote. This program kicks Microsoft Powerpoint squarely in the balls. ///thechooper</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Strong scientific arguments; frightening movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Al Gore, after losing the 2000 election for presidency, returns to giving his environmentalist lecture (give over 1000 times) across the world, and now has produced a movie summarizing his key points. Interspersed within are various tidbits about important events within his own personal life which may have shaped his views on environmentalism and moral responsibility.While not being a global warming expert (most of us are not), I consider myself a pretty well-informed, smart professional. His data, presented for a general audience (this is a movie after all) in easily digested sound-bytes woven into a long but engaging argument, was fairly comprehensive and made good common sense. All measures, obtained independently from one another, appear to indicate that a significant cause in global warming is an increase in atmospheric CO2 to heretofore unseen levels (i.e., off the charts!). The data show a sharp rise in CO2 in the past several decades, compared to the past several hundred thousand years (as inferred from trapped gas bubbles from Antarctic ice frozen from snowfalls eons past). The curves he presents for explosive human population growth, rising fossil fuel usage, sharp rise in atmospheric CO2, peaking average global temperatures, etc, eerily match up to one another. One would have to be in plain denial to not even consider a causal relationship between human activity, CO2 emissions, and a climate gone haywire.The prediction of warmer oceanic temperatures contributing to more powerful hurricanes appears to have been realized. Other predictions are made: should ice sitting on top of continental shelves melt into the ocean, sea level would rise 20 feet and result in the redrawing of almost all major coastlines, resulting hundreds of millions of people displaced (think hurricane Katrina in New Orleans magnified by 10^3). He suggests a tipping point of no return resulting from ice in the North Pole and Greenland melting away, resulting in a net absorption rather than reflection of solar energy into the ocean which would hasten this process.Mr. Gore asserts that the seeding of doubt by popular press, in likely service of large corporate interests, has done much to keep public awareness stagnant. When he presents data regarding scientific articles in peer reviewed journals, compared with articles in the popular press, 100% of scientific journals are in consensus about mankind causing global warming, whereas only 50% of popular press articles are in consensus. The polarization of the American public opinion on this topic is evident in this forum, with a clear bimodal distribution of votes for the movie... one peak at 10/10, the other 1/10. Clearly there are other motivations at work here.Yet Mr. Gore's final message is optimistic, and he encourages US citizens to become active in the face of this impending catastrophe, rather than throw one's hands up in despair. Despite any criticisms that people may raise about the movie (conspiracy theorist, partisan-inspired, alarmist, a re-election campaign strategy), this recommendation along with others provided at the finale to reduce dependence on foreign oil and promote a more energy-efficient economy are largely indisputable. It is up to us whether we wish to work toward these goals, or remain in our comfortable homes and maintain the status quo... with possible disastrous consequences for the latter path.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Funny how this movie's approval rating is the inverse of Bush's</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>And no coincidence. Those in the "reality" based community will be able to appreciate a film that is very clearly presented, factually rich, and geared to those without extensive scientific training. Gore makes a compelling moral case that is apolitical and that appeals to viewers' common sense - rather than the fear, anger, ignorance and greed of those who argue that massively unbalancing the planet's environment is somehow trivial, unavoidable, or nonexistent. While right-wing Bush loyalists will surely slam this film without seeing it, will argue that drilling for more oil in environmentally sensitive areas is better than employing existing technologies to eliminate our need for oil, that smoking is healthy, and that the earth is flat, any true "conservative" will be inspired to renew that now dead "conservative" notion of conservation. Remember the good old days of "conservative" Republicans: "If fish could vote, they'd vote for Nelson Rockefeller."My only criticism is that the movie could have mentioned that nearly half of the CO2 released into the atmosphere is absorbed by the oceans (called the carbon sink), and that this has measurably raised oceanic acidity in the past few decades to the point where the shells of phytoplankton are dissolving. As phytoplankton are the base of the entire global food chain, the increased oceanic pH level will have catastrophic ramifications for all life on earth, starting with massive declines of oceanic life - which we are seeing already.If you are someone with any concern for the future of earth, who realizes that the world is highly dynamic and not decreed fixed in stone tablets, and who wants to ensure that we and our children don't have to face catastrophic tragedy, this film is a must see. While some may savor the life ending potential global warming presents in the hope that biblical Revelations will bring an end to this world, those with vision, determination and a sense of moral responsibility can act to employ idle technologies and idle will and address a looming disaster that is barreling towards us with the same visibility as hurricane Katrina crossing the Gulf on a radar screen.</fullReview>

What he does is not easy to do. And to think, we might have had someone like that as our president....Inconvenient strikes a wonderful balance between fact and entertainment, caution and optimism. Just as the weight of the message caused me to begin teetering between denial and despair, Gore mentions the human tendency to do just that and gently heads away towards how we can make a positive change. Scary, effective and necessary, this movie must be seen and appreciated as one of the best uses of our movie culture.</fullReview>

Although he was orders of magnitude more eloquent, the basic facts to which Mr. Gore referred can be found in the National Geographic Channel piece on global warming and the ice age that will follow. Surely we cannot accuse the National Geographic Channel of being liberal.Bottom line, Al Gore is as right as one can be. He is using the best evidence available to show us that we are in serious trouble. Not only are we irresponsible if we don't see it, we are irresponsible if we don't take action.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Reality is Back</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I believe the spoiler caveat does not apply to this film. It's obvious what it's about and the position it takes. If you have no clue, then this review has spoilers and you might want to stop reading now. There are two necessary objectives in this documentary. One is building the credibility of the speaker, Al Gore. The other is building the case for recent global warming being the result of human activity. Both stories are necessary to make the case. You have to believe the presenter in order to believe the case he makes.In the end I believed him as a person and I believe he has his facts in order. However, something else happened to me in the end. I made a similar journey. I incorporated these facts into my story, my history, and my future plans.Those of us who were teenagers or older in the 1960's saw a glimpse of this 45 years ago. It took a lot of money and drugs, but we were able to ignore it. Well, reality is back. Double talk is dead. How do I accommodate this into my life, my choices? That is the question Mr. Gore raises for himself and, in the end, raises for me.This "film" is really performance art. It's like the concert tour movie: Gore travels the globe giving the same slide show from his laptop. The presentation is filmed and edited with B-Roll footage. He makes a case for being a real human being himself and does it much more effectively than he did while campaigning. It's not about him, though. It's about us, each of us.One last note. He has compassion for us and does not raise our anxiety. He raises our awareness and nudges us toward a necessary acceptance in a loving way.See it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Does human green house gas production CAUSE global warming?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film shows how the concept of causality has become so elusive for scientists themselves -- the very people most citizens expect to be most familiar with it. That clear, functional (in the mathematical sense), and at least coincidental relationships exist between recent green house gas production and recent global warming is undeniable, as is a mechanistic explanation of how such alleged results of human activity can lead to global warming. Since no peer-reviewed expert in the field of "climate change" has put forward to my knowledge, a generally scientifically acceptable theory as to an alternate source of these sudden, vast amounts of gases, the generally accepted theory, which Gore presents, is probably the best example one can hope for these days when showing a scientifically supported theory of a cause and effect. It remains for his critics to show clearly that causes other than human activity are the culprit.Incidentally, this film shows how Harvard can have such a reputation for excellence, if a former student can remain so inquisitive and inspired by what he learned there, so long ago.</fullReview>

It's not all doomsday - and there is a glimmer of hope, but Gore explains how quickly it's fading. I would have preferred Gore spend a little more time on this area of the film, but he does cover it, and overall makes a clear cut case for taking action now before it's too late. Ultimately, this is more than just a film or a documentary, it's a political and social statement about doing the right thing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The scariest movie you will see this year</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It will come as a surprise that in a year that has already brought us such horror films as The Omen, Silent Hill and The Hills Have Eyes, that the scariest film of 2006 is one narrated by the man who was formally the next President of the United States.To what I am referring is An Inconvenient Truth, a documentary starring Al Gore which details the effects of global warming on the planet we all like to call home.The film is textbook presentation. Al stands in front of large screens and scares the bejesus out of us by showing how CO2 levels have risen in the past century, how polar ice caps are mysteriously disappearing and our constant use of fossil fuels have affected the weather patterns (and not in a good way).Like sitting back in high school with a bag of popcorn in our laps instead of love notes to be passed forward, the film throws statistics and graphs at us quicker than a speed freak trying to explain to the police that he isn't high. We learn in horror on the same screen that Wolverine snitted his claws the week before that ten of the hottest years on record have occurred in the past fourteen years, and that at this continued rate of climatic change the costal cities around the world would suffer catastrophic flooding resulting in the potential death of hundreds of millions of people.An Inconvenient Truth has it all. It has the details, the science and the visuals to back up its claim. Seeing pictures of various glacier regions and mountain tops from yesteryear and again in 2005 will prove without a shadow of a doubt that the world is changing and that that we being both the disease and the cure need to change our thinking in order to avert disaster.This all makes An Inconvenient Truth an important film to see (although waiting for the DVD release would not be such a bad option). Al Gore as its host, narrator and sole voice of reason brings just the right amount of intelligence, charisma and humor (yes, you read that correctly) to keep us informed and entertained through the film's end credits. If you can get past the fact that he star lost his shot at the White House due to a state that could be underwater in 10 years and that he continually uses the phrase "?a good friend of mine?" like someone at a party you want to skewer with the toothpick keeping your martini olive afloat.But just as Gore is the right man for the film's complex roll out of facts and heavy presentation, the segments containing his retelling of his upbringing and personal experiences and tragedies are the film's one big drawback. No offence to the man that might have one day had his finger on the button, but seeing pictures of him as a youngling retelling stories of how he used to work on a tobacco farm, strayed from the overall message and felt more like a campaign for re-election rather than progressing the narrative towards a work-for-the-future conclusion.But that is just a small snake in a movie with plenty of ladders. An Inconvenient Truth will be a frontrunner for Best Documentary once the Oscar nominations are announced for 2006. But, more importantly, the movie will become a staple for education departments around the world. And that is the convenient truth.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film is essentially the lecture on global warming Gore has delivered for years, "probably more than a thousand times." As a result, the presentation is polished, thorough, approachable, and compelling.Gore, the self-described "Former Next President of the United States", aims to raise awareness of the problem of global warming. The globe is addicted to an unsustainable lifestyle, and as we've heard with other addictions, the first step to recovery is admitting you have a problem. But as the evidence accumulates, so too do the greenhouse gases. The solutions offered in the closing credits give small comfort. And rather than Melissa Etheridge's "I Need To Wake Up", perhaps REM's "It's The End of the World As We Know It" is more apt.Which isn't to say it's the End of the World. But the world will change, and drastically. What remains to be seen is if those changes will anticipate the trends we're observing today, or simply react to the damage yet to be done.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brother Al's Traveling Salvation Show</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although the Bible says "ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free", in today's media-dominated corporate America, knowing the truth and informing others about it may only lead to personal attacks, thwarted careers, and deep denial, especially if that truth threatens powerful interests. David Guggenheim's film of Brother Al's Traveling Salvation Show, An Inconvenient Truth, does not hold back, however, from telling us unpleasant truths about the effects of global warming, including the fact that ten of the past fourteen years have been the warmest in our history. Brother Al of course is Al Gore, former candidate for U.S. President in 2000 who lost the election to George W. Bush by a hanging chad.The film features a warmer and more spontaneous Gore who, in recreating the multimedia presentation he has shown all over the world, takes a passionate stand on the environmental issue he claims should have the highest priority in our political agenda. In his slide show, Gore displays the disappearing snows of Mt. Kilimanjaro, the shriveling lakes in Africa, and the disappearance of glaciers in Glacier National Park. He asks us to look at unprecedented hurricanes fueled by warming currents in the Gulf of Mexico, temperatures in excess of 120 degrees, and an increasing envelope of air pollution in Los Angeles, Mexico City, and Shanghai, China. The film is a personal essay that includes reflections on his sister's death from lung cancer and his son's automobile accident at the age of six. It is also a spirited call to action.While it may be uncertain whether mankind is simply contributing to very long-range climate instability or is solely responsible, Gore presents a strong case that the environmental choices we have made have contributed to the current climate crisis. He also doesn't hesitate to point out that the U.S., with 5% of the world's population, contributes 30% of the total CO2 emissions and that the present administration has filled high environmental positions in his government with representatives from the oil and gas industries. According to Gore, if we do not reverse the current trends, our future may see an increase in deaths from global warming to 300,000 a year, the rise of sea levels that could inundate coastal cities, an increase in heat waves and droughts, new diseases and crop-attacking pests, and an extinction of species and disruption of existing habitats.While some may scoff at the dire warnings, history abounds with evidence of sudden climate changes that may have wiped out entire species or even civilizations. While suggesting that political action could force manufacturers to curb pollution and persuade Detroit to manufacture more fuel-efficient cars, Gore's message is mostly directed at each individual and the energy choices they must make. The closing credits also list hundreds of things that each of us can do. Political will, Gore says, is a "renewable resource" and, if given the proper respect, the film can be an important catalyst for change.The reality, however, is that we live in a world filled with fear, greed, and corruption and it may require more than correct energy choices to effect change. The crisis it seems is not only in our atmosphere but also in our values, in the things we hold to be important and unimportant, which are reflected in our economic system. We cannot simply sit back and "go gentle into that good night", but must "rage against the dying of the light" whether it takes the form of environmental choices, political action, or simply an expanded awareness of our potential for love and compassion. An Inconvenient Truth entreats us to "reach the candle in the heart of man, waiting to be kindled" and, in our own way, to re-light the flame before it is extinguished forever.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sure, we know all the environmental stuff. Why see the movie, right? I saw it, anyhow. It was far, far beyond my expectations. Yes, it contains a huge amount of incontrovertible information. It also gives us a living, breathing picture of Al Gore that never made it into the media when he was running for President. He's, in a word, astounding. One watches him for a minute or two and cannot help contrasting him with what the Supreme Court picked. One watches for a half-hour, an hour. The longer the film goes on, the more breathtaking the performance, the starker the contrast between what is and what might have been. Bring your children and grandchildren to the movie--this is a legacy to bestow.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>See this movie - It Rocks</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Man, is this a good movie. Its like a science fiction thriller with real science. Its straight forward, fast paced, relevant and intelligent.Aren't you tired of "Monster of the Week" movies, "How Fast Can People Drive" movies and "How many people can have sex" movies? If you want to watch something you haven't seen before, something that you'll actually care about after you leave the theater, you'll love this film.There is NOTHING more misunderstood than Global Warming. People don't understand any of the theories or science behind it. Why should they? CNN, Fox News, MSNBC have better things to do than talk about climate change. They have Aruba to talk about after all.Don't be afraid you'll be bored. Its as good as any movie you've seen in the last year, and you'll walk out of it feeling lucky to have seen it.Gore, by the way, was a great narrator. Too bad he didn't win Florida in 2000. Ah well, he wouldn't have made this movie if he had.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>too weak</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film is too weak and doesn't deliver for what its purported purpose is. It stops at just noticing that somethin''s wrong and asks the poo' folks to turn one lightbulb off each... It totally fails to even attempt to go into the reasons why the situation is the way it is, and why there is resistance to what appears to be both evident and truly dangerous. Al Gore uses this movie more to display the Apple logo wherever and whenever possible (he's on Apple's board!), to lament about his friggin farm which once produced tobacco, drags his unbelievably long and monotonous monologues, and does more service to the Chaneys of the world by failing to go to the root of the problem, than to the idiot audience the movie supposedly is geared for and who are supposed, for the first time I guess, to learn about pollution and global warming. For those who started suspecting that the environmentalist movement itself has been hijacked by the elites and used with a spin, this movie is yet another hint. Ain't it too suspicious that Gore fails to raise some real questions? How come he CAN have this movie shown all across the country theaters with all 4 or 5 folks in the audience as was the case when I saw it? Much better documentaries, with much more to say, can't. How come? Who's AG really working for here, eh?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great message but weak on solutions</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Al Gore has made an informative and shocking documentary/thriller that had many strong points but lacked in one aspect: solid solutions. While Gore's exhortation of more efficient lightbulbs et. al. household solutions are helpful, they will not (let's be frank) make a large difference in the long run. Love it or hate it, nuclear energy is the answer. I could write essays on why nuclear is the best solution, but I do not have room here. All I ask is that you skeptics out there actually research nuclear energy, rid yourselves of your media-induced ignorance on nuclear waste, and keep an open mind. Had Al Gore not been a Democrat, this movie could possibly have been complete. P.S. I am looking forward to the upcoming documentary on the "mysterious" disappearance of the electric car.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all I was sorry to see so few people in the theater, and most of us were older. This is a film to take your kids to, and talk about with friends. Share this film with your church group or any group that you can. I also recommend NOVA's "Dimming the sun" and Discovery's "Global warming, what you need to know with Tom Brokaw".Only thing about the film that I found disconcerting was that it seemed chopped up with scenes of Mr. Gore walking through airports.Our country and the world is being run more and more like a business and everyone is going to pay the price. If you don't protect your assets you will loose your business seems not to have occurred to some of the energy companies. I remember our sixth grade science teacher telling us that we would run out of coal in our life times. That would be good but by then nothing will be growing and most of the population will be gone if the climate does a major shift. Yesterday we went to a little political gathering and a sign said, "---------, didn't learn from 9/11. 9/11 is not the worlds biggest problem, global warming and a president who admits he doesn't read science is the problem. We can't take a lot longer to change, time is running out. Putting all our resources into ending our dependency on oil is what our government needs to be doing.Political action is one route but personal choices do make a difference. We put all energy saving florescent bulbs in our house, keep the thermostat at 75 in the summer and 68 in the winter, and recycle everything we can. Everyone needs to pay more attention to what is happening because if/when we hit the tipping point there is no solution that will save most of the planet as we know it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A moving eye opener, but can it overcome media-controlled apathy?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An incredible documentary. We live in a world where the 24 hour media presents fearmongering coverage that gives us only the issues that are in someone else's interests. Individuals have to read between the lines every day to try and get proper perspective and form an informed opinion, and this documentary should be the starting point for all of us on this incredibly contentious issue. No doubt many will criticize this film for its viewpoints, but fundamentally, I think Al Gore's point is made quite clear. Pollution is bad whether you believe in global warming or not. Our population is exploding, whether you believe in global warming or not. Technology does exist to affect and possibly reverse the trends we are seeing, whether you believe in global warming or not. Al Gore obviously has been following this issue for most of his life and whatever the bias of evidence he presented, he portrayed himself as a deeply motivated individual, with a moralistically centred cause that he wants to try to convey to others. This documentary should be seen by all with an open mind and whatever your opinion afterwards, get involved and read more. Choose your own direction, but realise that apathy is never an option. For more on globalisation and the balance of environment and economy, read Thomas Friedman "Lexus and the Olive Tree" and "The World is Flat". For an opposite viewpoint, told as fiction but with "non-fictional" research, Michael Crichton's "State of Fear." There is so much information out there for us, given by good people. With 24 hours in the day, can this not become a daily issue for all of us? Hopefully the status quo will not continue into the next Presidential term. P.S. Given the quality of his public speaking alone, just think of what the world could have been like...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Why is it that Europe is already so hip to the idea of carbon-emission responsibility and Al Gore is still trying to convince people that global warming is real? It's embarrassing. If the science presented in this movie is correct, we are in trouble if we don't change how we dispose of our waste, use up the world's resources and tread more lightly on the planet.Even if the science is incorrect, anyone who lives in a city can taste how bad the air has gotten and knows where that throat-scratching smog comes from. Even if the world is not going up in flames, we should realise that our cars and factories pollute the air. Jut like cigarette smoke promotes cancer, inhaling the exhaust fumes from a car will no doubt contribute to our illness. One day it will no longer be viable ot be in the oil industry. If America wants to continue to be an economic giant it needs to be on the forefront of new technologies. Another commenter (Jeff Davis?) touted the education level in the U.S. Well, your bright scientists should be able to come up with energy that doesn't stink. And while they're thinking about that, they should start using up a little less energy, get a little exercise and have a better attitude for our future. Stop bickering about whose right- there are so many signs in our lives that show that how we are living is not healthy!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Misleading Reviews on this movie and the science behind it...Beware!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Since most of us are not scientists a controversial issue such as global warming can be very confusing. In this movie All Gore did an excellent job of explaining it and making it clear that human kind needs to make some changes. This is not a left vs. right issue any more than an earthquake is? but it is a political issue. It is political because in this case human kind is causing the "earthquake" and a small percentage is making a huge profit off of the technologies causing the "earthquake"? I mean global warming.An example of someone who is trying to undermine the movie, the science of global warming and All Gore is Tom Harris. Tom Harris is listed as "Guest Writer" is effectively a lobbyist and his organization is a member of the Canadian anti-Kyoto group. This site won't allow links so go to Google and search "An embarrassment to Australian science" and the first link will illuminate much. This link has a lot of other good links in it too.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You know, there are some movies that just totally blow you away, like The Shawshank Redemption or The Mission. But this one's different because IT'S TRUE. When the movie was over I turned to my brother and said, "Why didn't I take the blue pill?", as though I had just been shown the real world in The Matrix. And boy, they're not kidding when they say that 'ignorance is bliss'.However, this is exactly why you SHOULD see this movie. It's time for Americans to hear the wake-up call Gore has been shouting for years. It's time for Americans to stop buying Hummers and SUVs, and realize that we're down a path which is becoming exponentially worse. Mankind, at this time, is like Scrooge from A Christmas Carol, being told by Marley what chains we shall bear in time.The most disturbing part of this whole equation is that An Inconvenient Truth was given a PG rating for 'mild thematic elements'. By 'mild thematic elements', do they mean 'the truth'? God forbid that someone should actually make a movie that tells 'the truth'! See this movie. If you value this planet, if you value your future, if you value your children's future, see this movie and join the wave of change that can save us.</fullReview>

We need very good and, very importantly, engaging. Al Gore is doing what I have not seen anyone else able to do up till now, get ordinary people to listen. As the climate crisis becomes more and more inescapably in our faces, more politicians will jump on it, but Gore has lead the way, has been leading the way, for a long time while it was an issue most people were happy to avoid looking at.Some may see this as a shameless bid for popularity. Hey - if it gets him popularity, he's earned it! By getting people to look at a not only inconvenient, but scary truth, Al Gore is demonstrating himself to be an actual world leader.

		<shortDescription>A very good presentation on global warming</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Al Gore is doing a very good job at exposing this issue.He presents scientific facts, lists actual research and results to document his point, along with visual photographic proofs of the evolution of climatic changes. This is more important in the documentary than Al Gore, his charisma or whatever detractors will comment on.I have an engineering background, and I don't believe hype and messages without foundation. I don't believe marketing. I am inclined to believe Gore's message, because he presents data that is not BS (instead of saying it's twice as worst or anything, he presents plotted data with actual axis and meaningful values). OK, he's also a great presenter.I am inclined to believe the scientific data presented is real, from verifiable sources and NOT made up. If so the data is solid.OTOH, I unfortunately do not trust the government on the issue nor the media:- The government acts on the will of lobbies, and if a Green lobby is not powerful enough to tip the balance, then the Oil and business lobbies will control the outcome of government policies, NOT the people. The Bush administration has a clear bias towards these industry lobbies. - The media looks for sensational news, but also is very conservative. The media is also very prone into using deception, fabricated truths and confusion. The media relies on the government support and advertisement funding. We the people do not fund them directly, and therefore cannot rely on it for its loyalty to us. It is only loyal to money and ratings.Al Gore's speech states that *There is NOT a single scientific paper* that puts in doubt the reality of the responsibility of human activity on global warming, nor the fact that there is a global warming. OTOH 50% of the news-media mention spread doubt and uncertainty on the topic. This was a survey of close to a 1000 publications. So it looks like the government and industry is just spreading FEUD.If there are detractors to AL Gore's message, then THEY MUST refute his words, and if they call him a liar, produce actual proof, and accept the proof to be scrutinized.I believe the government must pass laws to enforce cleaner industry and cars. There can't be free enterprise if we don't all follow the same rules. For example, if we don't set the same pollution rules as other countries for cars, the US manufacturers will not invest in R&amp;D, and will be caught short and non-competitive suddenly, and face a crisis and go bankrupt. Oh wait! That was the 70's... Oh wait! It's happening again!Let's hope we'll soon get a government that is not shortsighted and will strive to ensure a good future for the children.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all, people say that this movie is just a PowerPoint presentation. Well, mostly. But within the presentation there are some amazing things. There's even a comical explanation of global warming animated by the creators of the Simpsons! Aside from the presentation, a large section of the movie is Gore talking about his personal life and how it has led to what he is today. The movie is well put-together and extremely engaging. It puts anything about Gore's stiff composure to rest.More importantly, though, the facts in this movie are deeply disturbing. The fact that half of Florida will be underwater if Greenland melts should be enough to motivate people to do something about Global Warming. Not to mention, Greenland could melt in the next few decades.And to all of you that have not seen the movie, but insist on denying the facts in it, I would like to say this to you: GO SEE THE MOVIE BEFORE YOU COMPLAIN TO EVERYONE ELSE! Also: WE ARE NOT IN A CYCLE. Not in the past 600,000 years has the parts of CO2 in the air per million parts everything else gone above 300. With the exception of the past couple of decades (up to and including now). To those who say natural water vapor causes global warming, I say this: Humans cause more water vapor to form by warming the oceans! And finally, to anyone who thinks that the facts in this movie are false, I say this: Do you really think Gore's just looking his stuff up on the internet or some other unreliable source? I mean, he's got connections. He could have the best meteorologists and climatologists and other scientists providing their research for him.This may be the most important documentary, if not movie, in history. I hope people listen. It will determine the future of America, the World, civilization, and humanity as a whole.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Otstanding. An Inconvenient Truth is truly a powerful film - well beyond a political promotion. Al Gore is fantastic. However, even those who are not his fans should see this for two very good reasons. First, I think this movie lays to rest any question about the reality of Global Warming. Less clear is the cause and effect of man's ever greater pollution of the planet and its contribution to the rise in global temperatures. However, even the skeptics should agree that the only alternative we have is to work on what we can control. Reducing air pollution, planting trees, maximizing fossil fuels, and moving to alternative energy sources now make sense. The second reason for viewing this film is because it is a masterpiece in its construction. How can a Power Point show from a politician become an interesting and engaging movie.

Millions of species wiped out. What a minute...humans, we're a species, aren't we? Gore does a masterful job at presenting the data and evidence. I'm not sure if re-opening the wounds of the "election" of 2000 was good idea. Or even flashing the face of anyone in the opposition. Although I realize he used these setbacks as an opportunity to address global warming to audiences around the globe. This issue transcends politics.People see Gore as a private citizen. A family hit by lung cancer and an auto accident that almost took the life of his 6 yr old son.I trust all the fact-checking will come up with agreement with the basic findings presented and that we challenge our leaders... political, business, educational, civic and otherwise, to start addressing our damaged environment in a meaningful way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Remarkably important film for all to see!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK, I thought I was up on the startling and scary details of this global warming thing, not that I think about it 24/7. But this film, especially the animated graphics of water rising in major cities around the world after the (potential) melting of the ice sheet over Greenland, made my eyes bulge. I know I wasn't alone in the audience, as I heard gasps several times throughout. Go and see this film with this in mind: you will be changed, you will be influenced and you will start thinking, 'what kind of commitments can I make to change my life?'There are no shortage of things you can do yourself to change your lifestyle and behavior (the film touches on a few in the end credits), but, in my view, the BIGGEST impact we can make is to make a commitment to take some of our time to be citizen lobbyists. All it takes is a few hundred thousand people DEMANDING that Congress change the so-called CAFE standards (auto fuel consumption minimum requirements) to make a GIGANTIC change. In this regard there are 1,001 ways to make yourself a rabble-rousing, agitatin' nuisance. I'll just recommend one EXCELLENT organization out there: The Apollo Alliance (http://www.apolloalliance.org/) whose goal is "Three Million New Jobs. Freedom from Foreign Oil."Sadly, the film failed in two ways: 1) Over emphasis on technology as savior. Technology will certainly play an important role in backing away from disastrous climatic change, but ultimately it will be political, economic and social changes that must come about. The West, esp. we in the United States cannot continue our ways of extraordinary consumption and waste. We must learn to live more simply and share community resources. Also, our use of technology must be scaled back to low-tech (appropriate technology is the term I heard in the 70s) and decentralized. The more food we grow as close to its final use, the better. In general, it will require a re-thinking of everything we do.2) The film also failed to consider the other side of the global warming equation. Sure, we know we need to reduce our production of CO2 in our transportation and centralized manufacture of goods, but what can we do to increase the production of O2 in the atmosphere? The answer is simple, yet hard to put into practice. Trees and LOTS of them! We must save our remaining old-growth (and medium growth) forests with a fervent passion and undertake a gigantic effort to plant more. As we all know from grade school science classes, trees breathe in carbon dioxide and breathe out oxygen, so it follows that the more trees we have the more of this excess CO2 in our atmosphere can be "sequestered" out of the atmosphere.Here are two excellent organizations working to end the destruction of our precious forests:Native Forest Council (www.forestcouncil.org/) and Rainforest Action Network (www.ran.org/)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Calling Davis Guggenheim's An Inconvenient Truth "just a film of a slide lecture" is the ultimate reductivism. Al Gore's lecture around which the documentary is built is an impressive performance, but also the result of a lifetime of passionate commitment to the environment.We're conditioned not to realize that Al Qaeda's worst attack is like a mosquito bite compared to what Mother Nature can do when aroused. As Gore offhandedly puts it, 9/11 was a terrible event, but maybe we ought to worry about other threats besides terrorism. There's a scientific consensus that climate change is currently dramatic, and that the major element in it is human and therefore reversible. It's also obvious that the US is the major contributor to global pollution, but is unable to deal with climate-caused disasters when they come, as the material and human damage done in the Gulf region last year by Hurricane Katrina vividly illustrates.In Guggenheim's documentary, Gore summarizes most of the major evidence of the warming phenomenon, with emphasis on melting ice and variations in carbon dioxide and temperature levels over the whole detectable range of geologic time. He explains what these changes are causing and predicts further future consequences ?- draught, floods, deaths, homelessness, species extinctions and increased disease, destruction of cities and loss of arable land (the world population has tripled in Gore's lifetime, one of the main contributing causes to this problem). Most dire and dramatic of the possible human outcomes: flooding of urban centers and settled lands resulting in displacement of as many as 100 million people.According to Gore, it's a major misconception that there's serious disagreement among scientists about climate change and the human role in it, a myth perpetrated by popular journalism. He cites a check of over 900 scientific articles related to global warming that found 0 that questioned its existence; and another check of 500-odd popular articles that showed 53% presenting it as uncertain. (The truth is that some scientists disagree, but they are in a small minority.) Another claim Gore deals with is that the US auto industry is holding its place by having bad emission standards. Given that GM and Chrysler are failing, this argument appears specious.We're like the frog in water slowly heated up to boiling that doesn't know to jump out, Gore says. Though the climate changes in fact are extremely rapid, they aren't perceived as such, but Gore hopes we will still be jolted, as his father was jolted to stop raising tobacco when his older sister died of lung cancer.As a Congressman, Gore tells us he thought his fellow politicians would see the urgency of ecological destruction. But they didn't. They tend to set aside any matter that isn't prominent in the minds of their constituents. Al Gore quotes Upton Sinclair: "It is hard to get a man to understand something, if his living depends on him not understanding it." Apropos of this, Gore gives the notable example of the Bush environmental official who altered scientific statements, then, forced to resign, went to work for Exxon Mobil the next day. It's interesting to contrast Gore's obvious clarity about science with those other leaders who favor bad science that they don't understand. A Gore administration would have been very different, one hopes, and his joking introduction, "You know me: I used to be the next president of the United States" is a sad reminder of that.The film opens and closes with a beautiful country scene in summer by a riverbank with everything quiet, verdant and blooming. It ends with the wish that our grandchildren don't have to look back and wish we'd done something.Despite this film's accomplished quality -- its sharpness and conviction, its smooth flow -- it has some obvious drawbacks. One of these is its focus on Gore's own personal history, and even the fact that Gore himself is unabashedly at the center of it. His unifying presence, and his forthright identity, make everything a political as well as scientific and moral issue. The film might even be seen, and in some circles is being seen, as a push to get him re-nominated by the democrats for President. But as has been pointed out, the dems lock-step voted against Kyoto ratification. In fact Gore comes though as calm, passionate, rational, and smart; he's not the people-pleaser that Clinton is but may have more real warmth. Gore has become more outspoken, strong, free, his own man since his "defeat." And that shows in his appealing speaking here. But still unfortunately Gore's reputation as numbingly boring, though belied by this film, may put off some people from watching it. Those who ignore that reputation will be surprised at the wit, humor, and personal honesty of the man -- and at his hope.Gore believes that there is hope, but in this film there is more about the basic phenomenon and less about what we can do about it -- which is almost presented as an afterthought, since such suggestions for individual action are peppered through the closing credits rather than contained in the body of the future. There could be more about popular campaigns to change policy as well as about the policies of other nations' governments. Overall there is more emphasis on the problem than on the response.And there is the same danger most committed documentaries have: of preaching to the converted, and alienating conservatives and non-believers in the facts the more because it's the last democratic nominee for president presenting them. And yet for Gore to pretend political non-affiliation would be un-candid. It's essential to his commitment that he should be all he is in his presentation.This is a powerful film, whatever its faults. And that not all will be swayed by it doesn't make it unimportant but underlines the need for it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I thought this was going to be b-o-r-i-n-g, but I was wrong!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If there were categories in the Academy Awards for turgid technical data made interesting, this movie would get it, hands down. An Inconvenient Truth is not inconvenient to watch. And it is important to see because the fate of our planet is at stake. It is our Spaceship Earth that shelters us from the harshness of space. Our crew members are of every nationality, race, religion, and everything else that separates humankind. Surely, we must learn to live together in cooperation, or we will not live at all.Sharp editing moves this film lot faster than Cars. Al Gore, defying danger in a cherry picker to reach the high point at the right side of his projected graph to create suspense, is a tongue-in-cheek hoot. That's as much action as you'll see except for the excellent animations. No trucks were harmed in the making of this movie.The facts come steadily, but slowly enough to absorb. The animation helps reinforce the message. This is a pedagological wonder that educators would do to imitate, if they could afford to duplicate it. Camera crew followed Gore and his projectors around the U.S. and to China and the Poles--and loping through airports--to capture his highly sophisticated "slide shows." A recent AP story surveyed some 28 climatologists who affirmed the accuracy of the facts except for some minor details that they said were not serious errors.There is no doubt there is global warming, especially of the oceans. Any idiot with a thermometer can measure it. Gore's big graph of hundreds of millions of years shows average temperatures getting higher in a jagged slope. Cause and effect is always a tough correlation to find, but Gore shows us a contemporaneous graph of carbon dioxide levels. The two look like they could fit together. The steepest slopes are in the last ten years, especially since 2000. When the oceans get warm enough, the natural circulation will stop eventually and temperatures will plummet into another ice age, scientists predict. While gradual warming was increasing in a linear fashion, there comes a "tipping point" when the effects increase exponentially--and we may already be there.Although another big freeze will solve the problem, and the Earth will probably survive it as it has before, the climatological changes wreak havoc on the world as we and other little fragile creatures know it. The melting of the polar and Greenland ice sheets, already well under way, will put major cities under water. Animation shows water covering a good part of the south end of Manhattan including the site of the World Trade Center. The warming trends have upset natural cycles so that caterpillar larvae now mature before baby birds hatch, depriving them of a food supply. Heat waves around the world have been more intense and so has drought in the cracked moonscapes of impoverished central Africa so that Lake Chad is more like a gully. In temperate climates around the world, including the U.S., mosquitoes, flies and other insects are advancing farther north than ever before, bringing new diseases with them. We've seen more frequent and more powerful hurricanes in the last several years in the Southeast U.S., unprecedented floods in the Northeast, and killer heat waves such as the one that killed hundreds in temperate-zone Europe in 2003. Earth's creatures will probably adapt, but there will be continued insurance premium hikes as coastal homes continue be washed into the sea--and a lot of death and hundreds of millions of refugees, those from drought seeking water, those from floods seeking higher land.After presenting the case, Gore concludes with showing how our present technology can use sources energy that do not contain the carbon in fossil fuels like oil and gas. Solar and wind energy is plentiful and renewable, and hydrogen is already being used. The technology already exists to remove carbon dioxide from the air. The most low-tech equipment are trees. We need to cut down fewer and plant more.Will this entertaining movie be force for changing public opinion and public policy? From what I can see, the people who go see it are those already inclined to believe it. If the film can galvanize their beliefs and convince those who are undecided we are not doomed. The human mind seems to be hard-wired to grasp immediate threats and react, like terrorism. However, we don't readily perceive gradual threats like global warming that would do far more damage.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Great Documentary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So many others, who have also seen the movie, said it better than I every could. I'll let you read their comments.Like any great teacher Al Gore explains global warming with a deep passion that began at a young age. The slides and other visuals are well done and easily followed. He ties warming process into how it affects our lives. Along with weather changes, I didn't realize the little things that are really quite big. Mosquitos are migrating to areas they haven't been before. The bark beetle isn't only effecting the Southwest (lost my trees) but Alaska as well. I know the beetle is always present but with global warming the trees don't have the sap to keep the beetle population down. We need cold snaps. We need rain. I didn't realize "how" the bird population was dying off. The caterpillars arrive two weeks before eggs hatch. The offspring's food source. It is the whys and hows that isn't being told in the general media or word-of-mouth.Grainy at times. Not a high budget film. Some comic relief. Not particularly a political statement. Altho some of his arguments were in Congress. Showed his background work for added credibility and sincerity. Very impressed with the orderly process of the movie and the ideas/hints shown during the credit run. See the movie. Then debate the global warming issue. Let's leave politics out of the debate. Use it for solutions.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a mind opening movie, I have so much more respect for Al Gore now, than I ever did. He could have done anything with the fame he has, but he's chosen to blanket the world with a message, a message of warning, but also of hope. This shouldn't be political, and he says that in his film. He also gives simple ways to do something about it, But his best point is that almost everything is renewable, including politicians. He doesn't sugar coat or get melodramatic, he just tells it like it is. Everyone should see this movie, even if you never thought about the environment before, it dispels a lot of myths. The only things I wish he would have done differently is that I wish he would have called out some of the main polluters more, and I wish he would have given more examples (on his website) or what we can all do to help.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Hidden Truth</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In college, we were taught about the "commons problem" -- this is where the actions of the individual don't materially affect the resource, but if all individuals fully exploit the resource, then it will collapse. The individual then has two choices: exploit as quickly as possible and get as much as s/he can before the resource collapses, or preserve the resource for all to enjoy, albeit at reduced "profit." It's one thing for fish or timber, or where the resource can be substituted (substitute farmed salmon for wild, etc.), or where the effect will happen within years, but another when it our global home and there is no substitute, and where the consequences will be borne by the next generation (sound like the federal deficit, social security or other "commons"?). That is the message of AN INCONVENIENT TRUTH. That is why it is a moral imperative. That is why until we MAKE it an issue, those in power in the public and private lights will not act.The film sends these messages loud and clear. Less confrontational than a Roger Moore piece, it presents its message (yes, it is propaganda) in a clear and matter-of-fact way. I do believe, however, that a Moore style approach is also needed. The quote of Winston Churchill sums it up: "...now is the time of consequences." Complancency will not be rewarded.My 11 year old daughter understood it quite well, which is good since she will be more affected by the subject of the film than I. Now if only those whose beliefs more materially affect our collective behavior would also understand it....This review is not about the film, but about the message. The fact that the message gets through speaks well for the film. The fact that there is a film, speaks well for the importance of the message.-Steve</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A must see film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a must-see documentary which truly goes to the heart of the matter in a scientific and objective manner. There are limited political statements thrown around and the film concentrates on the science of global warming. It presents tons of data collected over centuries to show and prove that global warming is real and not another politically hot issue of the moment.As a biology research scientist, this was particularly interesting to see because it was presented in a scientific way, as opposed to through childish soundbytes. Al Gore comes off more as a scientist than a politician here.It also showed the fact that not a single professional, scientific publication disagreed with the validity of global warming. There are some disputes as to the technicalities and details, as in evolution, physics, chemistry and other sciences, but the big picture is agreed upon by everyone, except those that are ideologically opposed to it, since their money profits are at stake. That would include our "beloved" president.Al-in-all, GREAT documentary! I gave it an 8, because I thought it wasn't adequate in terms of offering solutions to global warming, except a quick 10-min run through at the end of film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A way to fight Global Warming not mentioned in the movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The most important thing that you can do to fight global warming was not even mentioned in this movie. Global warming has been called humankind's "greatest challenge" and the world's most grave environmental threat. Human activities are causing large amounts of "greenhouse gases" (gases that prevent heat from escaping from the Earth's atmosphere) in the atmosphere. This then causes the air around the Earth to become hotter, which scientists say will increasingly lead to catastrophic natural disasters, such as more frequent and intense hurricanes, flooding, and drought. Many people are trying to help reduce global warming by driving more fuel-efficient cars and using less electricity, but by far, the most effective thing that you can do to fight global warming is to go vegetarian.The billions of chickens, turkeys, pigs, and cows who are crammed into factory farms each year in the U.S. produce enormous amounts of methane, both in their digestive processes and from the feces that they excrete. Scientists report that every molecule of methane is more than 20 times as effective as carbon dioxide is at trapping heat in our atmosphere. Statistics from the Environmental Protection Agency show that animal agriculture is the single largest cause of methane emissions in the U.S. Raising animals for food is causing global warming.

		<shortDescription>most important movie of this century</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If only half of the warnings contained in this film come true, this movie will be remembered as the most important film ever made. I find it revealing that 15% of the respondents who voted on this film rated it the worst--their submission cannot be one based on its technical brilliance, but, I suspect, on its content: these people are worried the film will boost the political hopes of the film's narrator, Al Gore. They miss the point. If the film was narrated by Al Smith it would still be a must-see. The issue is not politics, but some folks cannot see beyond their own agenda. I sense they fear political fall-out for the non-action taken by recent administrations on the issue of global warming. As Florida sinks beneath a foot of water and large parts of the coast lines of many nations are subsumed within the next 50 years, such concerns will seem, in retrospect, provincial, ignorant, and silly. Gore has done us all a great service with his lectures and Cassandra-like alarms. Please, see this film, do what you can to avoid what is coming at us like a meteor, and tell others to see it, too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Scariest film I've ever seen.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One need not spend hours searching the internet to come to grasp the subject matter of global warning. Al Gore does a terrific job of telling the story. I cannot envision a better way of getting the points across. Every person on the planet should rush to see this documentary. I saw the film in Owensboro Kentucky with my wife on the opening Saturday night. Owensboro is Kentucky's third largest city. The parking lot at the multiplex was filled to capacity. I'd never seen such a collection of trophy SUV's and pick up trucks in my life. I would estimate that the average fuel economy of the vehicles in the theater lot was between 12 and 15 MPG. On opening night the most important film of the decade drew a total of two viewers. What film did all those people with the gas guzzlers go to see? I can't imagine. Dukes of Hazzard has come and gone. There are no more Ernest movies in the making since his untimely demise. When I returned home I went to my computer to check out the local reviews of the film. No mention. Nothing on the Fox news or CNN websites. No commercials on local TV. In 30 years half of Florida will be under water. Billions of people in south east Asia will become refugees. Polar Bears will exist only in captivity for their natural habitat will be gone. Europe will be entering an 8th ice age because of failure of the normal ocean currents. The film was scary and probably close to 100 percent accurate in its predictions of gloom if huge changes in human behavior are not undertaken immediately. Even scarier to me is the fact that my wife and I were the only ones in the theater tonight.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is quite obvious that the vast majority of those individuals posting negative reviews have neither seen AN INCONVENIENT TRUTH nor read the book. I strongly recommend them both as a powerful introduction to the topic of global warming and climate change. Of all the facts, figures, statistics, and graphs, the one that particularly jumped out at me was the projected human population growth as we continue into the 21st century. It appears we will be in the neighborhood of nine billion people around the year 2050 (We were at about one billion in 1800 and are at about six billion now). I'm not sure the Earth can continue to sustain that many people indefinitely. So do we start making smart, incremental changes now, or do we wait until clean water, food, and energy become scarce and highly-fought-over commodities? Like many problems, the more we put it off, the more painful it will be.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It is not a political issue but a moral issue - and I totally agree</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all let me tell you that I am a liberal not a conservative. But that does not have anything to do with my rating of this movie. From the time this movie came out, I have wanted to watch it. Finally, we got the time to do it today (July 2, 2006). My wife and I left our daughter at our friend's home and went to Tivoli Cinemas in Kansas City (in the historic Westport district). We have never been to this place and wanted to check it out. No other theater in the Missouri side of the Kansas City is playing this movie as far as we know.This movie opened my eyes to the sincerity displayed by Al Gore. The facts presented seem very believable and logical (I am pretty good in science and am a practicing engineer). I even learned last week that almost all the scientists and climatologists that have seen the movie agree with the science behind it.It was heart wrenching to see the snows and icebergs melting everywhere. It is extremely believable to look at the ice cores all the way to 650,000 years before and see how we are at a height of carbon-Di-oxide levels right now. It makes me angry to see a country as powerful and rich as ours display such a shallow mentality to this global crisis. It looks like we are so greedy about our everyday lives that we are not looking at the consequences. It almost seems like we are in the mode of party until we drop. Seems very juvenile. The movie has some comedic moments, such as "write to your congress-person to make them change", if they don't change - you run for congress. I am awaiting my US citizenship any day now, watch out America, I might run for congress someday. Hopefully we are not too late to avert Armageddon.We moved from Pennsylvania to Kansas City only a year ago and the political landscape is quite different here. Judging from the bumper stickers that people have at my work, it looks like most people treat George W as god. But, I was quite surprised to see people chide and snicker at me when I mentioned that I am going to watch this movie. I got responses saying that I am going for a brain wash, etc. These are engineers that I work with and I hope they got a sound scientific education. I am appalled to know that there is so much controversy about something this basic. Oh well. All I can say to everyone is, if you have an ounce of concern about the environment, please go watch this movie and spread the word.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Overrall, I believe this movie does a great job of showing the effects of global warming. Since the other comments already show the positives, I will focus on what I saw were setbacks. This movie's largest set back was the irrelevant clips on his election in 2000 and family life. First, by reminding the audience of this election, he naturally divides this movie into a democratic/republican subject. Yet, global warming should be a subject important to all parties. Furthermore, the election portion had little, if not nothing, to do with the subject at hand. Thus, had he not focused on this portion of the movie, I would have liked the movie better. Furthermore, he focused on certain subjects related to global warming too little. The economy is a very influential subject to the public. By focusing more on how the economy will benefit from environmentally-friendly measures, he would have created a better presentation. Furthermore, he should have focused more on solutions to global rather than focusing almost entirely on the obvious problems with our environment. Lastly, rather than simply using a bunch of clips from his presentations and making the movie almost entirely about his take on global warming, he should have had other scientists, policymakers, and environmentalists opinions in his movie. By using only his voice and presentations, it makes his presentation very easy to pinpoint as one-sided.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>At first, I figured that a movie based on a PowerPoint presentation didn't really need to be seen on the big screen, but having finally succumbed to good buzz from friends and media, I found that I was mistaken after all. Surprisingly, the still photos Al Gore offers of the effects of global warming are quite effective ? breathtaking and disturbing ? on the big screen. There are, of course, some videos too, and even a few quite funny cartoons, but the director chooses to show all of these through Gore's giant video screen, which means that we are, barring some autobiographical interludes in Tennessee and so on, firmly placed in the seats of Gore's college audience. This seems like folly, but it is surprisingly effective.Speaking of those autobiographical bits, Gore narrates some key turning points in his life, but I wish he had explained what epiphany transformed him from a guy that couldn't carry a CSPAN session to a guy that can carry a major motion picture! I definitely want him for president now, almost in spite of myself. As for the science, I did learn a lot, and I thought he was most effective when he took shots at the characterization of global warming as "theory." This movie is a force for good and its actually well mad and honest; it's nice when these things come together for once.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gore has some excellent graphics: photos, charts, etc. galore, and is quite thorough is his explanations. Photos of glaciers back when and today, diagrams of melting in the Anarctic and Greenlands and the effect on sea level, charts showing the relationship of CO2 to temperature, etc. It's all very clear and unmistakable in its implications. Gore travels to far away spots to see firsthand how far certain phenomena have gone down the road to disaster and is a non-professional, but quite good student of the scientific literature. One minor criticism is that neither James Hansen nor Ross Gelbspan get much notice. Gelbspan is never mentioned, as far as I recall. And, Hansen is discussed because of the Government trying to silence him. But Gore never says anything about the fact that it was Hansen's congressional testimony in 1989 that represented the first cross-over moment for the issue of global warming. Bill McKibbens, author of The End of Nature, isn't mentioned either. McKibbens is important, because, while his data is not up to the present, the sort of philosophical grounding in that book will never be out of date.Definite thumb up!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just saw this movie yesterday. I am amazed at how moving and sobering it is. The points are presented very clearly and logically. It's not boring, it's not shrill, it's not all cold, scary science but not all touchy-feely stuff either. It works.And I'm sorry but I believe in science. What have we come to when people have to apologize for accepting scientific data? (Sure, data can be faked but overwhelming amounts of it most likely cannot.) Do you not trust science when it comes to your medical care? So some science is OK if it directly benefits you. Sad.Why is it so hard to believe that human behavior can affect the earth? Or is it just easier to think that it can't? Wouldn't it be better to err on the side of caution here? Or is it because Gore is a Democrat that he MUST be trying to pull something over on the world? I admire Al Gore tremendously for even attempting to take on such a huge issue (one surrounded by so much contention and vitriol). He's made himself a target for all the flat-earth people and he doesn't care. We still have time to do something. We can do this. Would you rather make changes to your lifestyle or have them made for you by events beyond your control?If the United States doesn't rise to this cause and begin to do the right thing, not only will we suffer the climatic consequences; we're going to suffer the political ones as well. Our standing in the world is going to fall; indeed, may already be falling. Other countries are stepping up to the plate on this...would you like for the USA's leadership and scientific and technological strength to be eclipsed by China?Americans are bigger than this...we used to know the importance of sacrifice and facing the truth that enable us to live in such a great country. We were tough! Now we're soft and greedy and comfortable. Again, if you just can't stomach the science and nature part of the climate change equation, think about this: our leadership position in the world is going to fall because we are choosing to no longer LEAD on this issue but wallow in our comfort and complacency.

		<fullReview>This film is excellent. Al Gore is a funny, and intelligent human being with immense integrity. I took my son to this film and he understood it and he enjoyed it, especially the Max Groening cartoons. I asked him afterward if he found it boring or too complex but I knew his answer before he said it. "No, Mom! Everyone should see this movie!" This, coming from a 13 year old boy. I can't help but believe that anyone with anything negative to say about this film either is employed or indirectly employed by the oil/gas/coal/U.S. automotive industry or thinks that environmentalism is a dirty word. This planet belongs to all of us and being stewards of it does not mean we have to be irresponsible and reckless stewards. We can, and should, be trying to learn as much as possible, if not for our own sake, then for our children's sake and for future generations. This earth is the only home we have, let's pull together and take care of it and let good stewardship and solid science transcend politics.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Environmentalists as the new Priests and Oracles</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Today, one of the most powerful religions in the Western World is environmentalism. Environmentalism seems to be the religion of choice for urban atheists. Why do I say it's a religion? Well, just look at the beliefs. If you look carefully, you see that environmentalism is in fact a perfect 21st century remapping of traditional Judeo-Christian beliefs and myths.There's an initial Eden, a paradise, a state of grace and unity with nature, there's a fall from grace into a state of pollution as a result of eating from the tree of knowledge, and as a result of our actions there is a judgment day coming for us all. We are all energy sinners, doomed to die, unless we seek salvation, which is now called sustainability. Sustainability is salvation in the church of the environment. Just as organic food is its communion, that pesticide-free wafer that the right people with the right beliefs, imbibe.Eden, the fall of man, the loss of grace, the coming doomsday---these are deeply held mythic structures. They are profoundly conservative beliefs. They may even be hard-wired in the brain, for all I know. I certainly don't want to talk anybody out of them, as I don't want to talk anybody out of a belief that Jesus Christ is the son of God who rose from the dead. But the reason I don't want to talk anybody out of these beliefs is that I know that I can't talk anybody out of them. These are not facts that can be argued. These are issues of faith.And so it is, sadly, with environmentalism. Increasingly it seems facts aren't necessary, because the tenets of environmentalism are all about belief. It's about whether you are going to be a sinner, or saved. Whether you are going to be one of the people on the side of salvation, or on the side of doom. Whether you are going to be one of us, or one of them.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a movie, it's not exactly a thriller, but as a means to communicate something as complex as global warming, it's great. Al Gore comes across as a funny, self-deprecating, smart guy - which I'm sure he is, but too bad he didn't have these editors in 2000.The movie is structured around the famous PowerPoint presentation that he's been doing all over the world. Over the course of the movie, I guess the entire presentation is shown. Intermixed are personal stories from Gore about how he got interested in the subject originally, his early tries to draw attention to it, as well as some of the personal tragedies in his life and how they further focused him on this cause. Only the briefest mention of the 2000 election is made - I would have liked to have more but it would have been a distraction.Unfortunately, with its limited, art-house, blue state release I'm afraid it's not going to reach the people who truly need to see it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>~Anyone who knows me also knows that I am one who would rarely ever stand on my soapbox, trying to cajole people into one thing or another. Out of respect for our God-given individual diversity, our unique manifestation of Spirit, and the simple cognizance that if the only thing humanity had were a few billion clones of me (or you) to make this world go round, we'd never have made it this far(!), I actually appreciate the differing worthwhile viewpoints, pursuits, and contributions of each of us that are uniquely our own. This is because I believe that eventually everyone benefits from our collective talents and strengths. A key word here, of course, is "worthwhile": defined in this case as falling in the category of being in harmony with God's plan, as opposed to Hitler's "worthwhile activities" for Hitler's plan.~Keeping my position in mind, I hope you'll understand that for me to now encourage you to do something that you'd perhaps otherwise not do, I am emphasizing to you the importance to me that I place in the following statement.~If you only see one movie this year? no, if you only see one movie this decade (and please, do not wait until the end of this decade), I feel that you owe it to yourself, your family, our ancestors and the civilization that birthed us, and most importantly, the children yet to come, to see "An Inconvenient Truth".~If we are to consider abortion to be a form of mass murder of some of our children and their children, then we are compelled to view certain other seemingly hidden, ignorance-based, and (in the end) devilish human antics as being no-less a threat to all of our children and their children. Indeed, the fate of civilization and our world as we were gifted hangs precariously in the balance, certainly and swiftly murdering and destroying if we blindly carry on in our poorly informed and oblivious state.~This story is presented as a movie documentary that presents with a simple clarity and in a relatively under-stated manner a highly inconvenient truth. It is one that, whether or not one chooses to ignore it, is now (and will, with a dramatically increasing consequence) affect every person upon this earth, as well as all possible future generations. In a relatively less important side-bar, this movie also weaves the story of how one human eventually found his biggest contribution to humanity by way of his apparent failure in American politics. Love, hate, or indifferent to Al Gore, no matter what your previous perception, you'll discover that he has become a rather remarkably changed man following his exit from the political scene. That said, Gore the messenger is not the message of this movie; a crucially important yet inconvenient truth is.~Thank you for reading and listening, and (hopefully) seeing "An Inconvenient Truth". ~Robert M.

This is perhaps the most crucial film of our time.Now, of course, it's not really an important movie for the thousands of climate scientists worldwide who already understand these issues. It is important to nearly everyone else, though--everyone who would benefit from a better understanding of the latest evidence on the Earth's fragile atmosphere and how humans are having such increasing effects on it that the term "Act of God" may soon be inapplicable to hurricanes and megadroughts.It especially is crucial for those who REFUSE to see the film (or, worse, want to review it poorly without having seen it).Now there is a way to maybe help those who are on the fence.ShareTheTruth (http://sharethetruth.us) is a site whereby anyone can request free tickets to go see An Inconvenient Truth. Others inspired by the film can help the cause and sponsor free tickets for others. If you found this film as compelling as 90% of the critics on Rotten Tomatoes did, help your friends and family into the theater. Offer to pay. If you can't afford to pay for them, lead them to ShareTheTruth and the site will pay for them.Without awareness, change is impossible.</fullReview>

Recently, we were honored by receiving lifetime movie passes to any movie any time at no cost! So we can see whatever we want whenever we want. The point of this is that CRITICS count for ZERO. Your local critics or the national critics like Ebert are really no different than you or me. The only difference is that they get to write about the movie and are forced to see hundreds of movies whether they want to or not.Therefore, it is our belief that if you get your monies worth for two hours of enjoyment that is good enough for us! We NEVER EVER listen or read the critics. We only care about our friends and those who we know like the same things as us. Well enough about that.All we can say is that everyone should see this movie. It is not political except by the virtue of the fact that the Republicans have ignored the FACTS.

It takes a dry, scientific subject and nails you to your seat for 100 minutes. When it was over, there was silence for a few beats and then the audience burst into applause. Even the teenage boy sitting next to me was spellbound for the entire film. And, it makes you heartbroken for how the environmental movement was abandoned in 1980. If we had had a responsive governmental effort for the past 25 years, we might have made a huge difference.

		<fullReview>"An Inconvenient Truth" attempts to explain the devastating effects of extreme carbon dioxide release on the environment in such a way that a child can understand. For those who have ever seen his live presentation, the movie is basically the same thing, with Al Gore's personal experiences in researching global warming as a narrative. The movie details all the ways that carbon dioxide release ruins the environment, but does not take into consideration the fact that the planet's second-best source of cheap energy, coal, will be burned up quite rapidly when the world's oil runs out in thirty years. Among the movie's several omissions, it does not explain at all how several coal power plants built in the 1950's by the TVA have been recently refit from the inside out, rather than replaced, in order to avoid installing costly pollution controls. The movie barely mentions "carbon-capture" technology, a means by which carbon dioxide is sequestered in coal-fired plants and buried rather than released into the environment. If the goal of "An Inconvenient Truth" is grassroots environmentalism spreading like wildfire through the general public, than it is a great film. This movie has the potential to make people think they can help save the world. "An Inconvenient Truth" gives moviegoers hope, which is more than any other movie currently in theaters does.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First, let me say that I'm from the polar (ha ha) opposite side of the political spectrum than is Algore. Still, I think this movie has a great deal of merit and should be seen by as many as possible. I'm giving it a very high star count more for the topic (and my thanks to the Algore for bringing it to the screen) than for technical achievement in movie making.I'm tired of the gloom and doom from both sides of this debate. I personally do think that there is climate change due to human activity, but also believe much of what we're seeing lately is due to nature cycles. Where I disagree with the critics of the global warming bunch is their contention that reducing carbon emissions would collapse our economy. I see no reason to believe that. Also believing that the oil companies and US carmakers (who can't build a decent small car) aren't at all involved with the counter propaganda is naive beyond belief.I withhold a star for two reasons. First, nobody, even Gore, will directly address (although he mentions) the largest single contributor to all environmental issues - the huge human population. That's the 900 lb gorilla in all environmental talk.The second reason is his taking cheap pot shots at Bush and indirectly, people like me, just to get a giggle from his True Believers in the audience. This bozo is still crying in his beer over the 2000 election.Overall, I highly recommend everyone, and I mean your kids too, see this movie. It's just too darn important to miss - even if the movie itself is somewhat flawed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well not really. When I ride my Expedition to the airport tomorrow though, I will think of this movie..Of course, I will just think about it, but won't actually do anything about it. See, I can't buy into this whole man-made Global Warming theory. Sure, many people have gone out and bought Hybrid cars because its trendy to be sensitive about such things as gas guzzling SUVs. But I have to think the hybrid car crowd are descendants of the bunker building parents of the nuclear age of the 50s and 60s. You know, stock up on supplies, build a bunker under your house and wait for the pending nuclear war.Some people are easily swayed by "authority figures" such as Al Gore lecturing on matters such as the impending doom of man made Global Warming. But people need to take a step back and catch their breath and ask fundamental questions: 1) Is the earth actually warming? And we know this how? The earth is 4 billion years old, yet our statistical evaluation of temperatures is of the last 100 years. Hardly compelling data. 100 out of 4,000,000,000 is hardly scientific.2) The earth has gone through many environmental cycles over its history. There was a time during the ice age when a sheet of ice covered the US all the way to Florida...and get this, it melted all by itself...! This was of course after scientists determined that the Artic Circle was once 70 degrees year round. And there were no SUVs to my knowledge roaming the earth then.3) The environmental lobby is a powerful lobby and will always take on big business. Whether its saving the rain forests, protecting the owl, or producing movies about a hyper heated earth, they will always say the end is right around the corner.Al Gore won't rebut the type of questions or facts that suggests a naturally dynamic earth. He won't explain how, or why, the earth heats and cools irregardless of mankind's impact. He won't answer it for the same reason I won't answer such questions: Because nobody has a clue why the earth reacts in such a manner.I watched this movie, and could not help but think how many people are going to run out, buy hybrid cars and say to themselves, "I am making a difference". The problem for these folks are, I am going to be behind them in my Expedition at 75 mph motioning to them to hit the gas pedal or get out of the way. I think then it will dawn on them they were suckered. But they'll have a trendy car that looks like an alien ship.I am giving this movie three stars out of ten. Its not a horrible movie, but its not factual either. Its just one man's opinion who, after inventing the internet, has channeled his energy into saving mankind from melting under oppressive heat. I give him an "A" for effort, but in the end, its just another opinion on the environment.On another note, I could not help thinking about the Dennis Miller quip of rising earth's temperatures. It was something of the effect: "I am supposed to believe the accuracy of temperature data from 1911, yet the guy recording the data had to sh!t in the woods..."?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The novel, State of Fear, has an interesting epilogue where the author, a many time award winner, several time best seller and Harvard trained scientist, talks about the global warming issue. The world came out of a mini ice age around 1850 and has only warmed up around a degree. Global warming may be a true problem and man may play a part, but we really aren't sure. To destroy the lives and jobs of millions of people to satisfy the political left seems a dangerous solution to a problem whose cause is unclear.The world has previously had ice ages and been a tropical rain forest, not to mention a desert. Almost all of that happened before men were even relevant to anything. Air pollution in America is dramatically better in the last 25 years. All that said, global warming may be true, but unless someone convinces China, most of Asia and India to remain poverty stricken, there isn't much we are going to do with the issues raised by Al Gore.So many of these left wing scares, population bombs, the end of resources and a nuclear winter have proved absurd. AIDS and Moslem terrorists are a bigger and more present danger with more obvious solutions. Al Gore may still want to be President. That's fine, but don't treat political ideology as science. We may have a problem, but Al Gore does not prove it or offer a practical solution.</fullReview>

Stick these 'I see the other side of the coin' people on a field full of land mines, tell them there is 30%, hell, let's say even 5% chance they walk across the field they'd get blown to bits. And tell them, if they put on these magic boots, they'd be 100% fine. I'd really like to see what these PhDs and skeptics would do. The real truth is, a good proportion of the general public wont bother with this saving our planet business until they are 'scared' into it, and even then, there will still be a number of people who just wont act on it. In Canada, our cigarettes packages have pictures of lung cancer plastered all over them, and hey, people are still buying, but that's none of my business.So we need everyone who is so 'foolishly' falling for Al Gore's dodgy statistics, like myself. Who's gonna act on anything that's an inconvenience, when there's no 'or-else's to go with it. A few might, but most don't...and who would make a documentary like this: Hey, global warming might be happening, but, it might not be. Here are some facts and counter facts. Go home and do your own research. End of film.I don't mind if the filmmaker exaggerates to get us do something for a worthy moral cause, call me ignorant.

It's like telling people that the world is going to end. "yeah, someday, we all know, thanks, preacher man." People won't hear things that sound outrageous without a consensus of opinion first.Because the "global warming" is only a THEORY, public opinion is not yet in consensus that this is a REAL problem, or that if it is there is anything we can do about it.For that matter, writing a comment on a board with 79 other comments, none of them in agreement with each other is about as likely to change anything as saying we should SOLVE WORLD PEACE.So for those of you who DO read comments, and DO want to understand what this movie is about, I will say this:See it, and make up your own mind. Tell everyone you know to see it, and make up their own mind. Tell everyone you know to tell everyone they know to see it and make up their own mind. If we actually do that, believe or not, we'll have a consensus of opinion, and maybe, just maybe we'll do something to change things.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Can Science Really Polarize This Much?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was impressed with Gore's ability to keep the film almost purely science-focused, especially in much of the first half of the film, without delving into politics and attacking our current administration. Global warming really does transcend politics, and I think he did a good job showing this through the factual information he presents and his lack of "bias" (arguable, but still, all is presented in a highly analytical light).However, I was also very interested (and a bit dismayed) to see the breakdown of the rating votes on IMDb - right now the film has an average at 6.8/10. I wondered why, when it clearly did a thorough job investigating such a far-reaching global problem and sparking Americans into action. So why the mediocre rating? In fact, there are very few ACTUAL mediocre ratings in between 2 and 7; the vast majority of user votes either gave this film a 9 or 10, excellent, or a 1! So did these 21% of voters who gave it a 1 reject the scientific premise of the concept of global warming itself and walk out of the movie enraged at such propaganda, or did they not see the movie at all and give it a 1 on principle to discourage other curious IMDb browsers from seeing it? Just curious.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Aside from stock narratives (such as the nationalist segment about American inventiveness at the end of the film or the reductive comparison between humans-facing-global-warming and complacent-frogs-in-water-heated-to-boiling-temperature), this movie is compelling, mobilizing to action, and powerful. I did concurrent research on the Kyoto Protocol treaty in 2003 for my bachelor's degree in Political Science, and many of the findings are overlapping.After seeing this film, I am finally motivated to transform my lifestyle and house into an environmentally responsible one. There are many recommendations online of how to reduce one's carbon emissions in daily living. My partner and I switched our regular incandescent light bulbs to compact fluorescent light bulbs, which should cut down our electric expenses by 75%. I also decided to quit flying on airplanes. Both of us don't even drive cars.As well, Al Gore offers us an optimistic call to action that will make even jaded liberals feel hopeful about the future of this planet. He also offers connections between the global warming issue and other political issues on both the liberal and conservative sides of the political discursive field.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>We're gonna die. That seems to be the main thrust of Al Gore's symposium on sunshine and line graphs.Woiking that Power Point mean machine like a Marketing Manager Gone Wild, the man who used to be "the next President of the United States" assails us with facts, figures and forecasts in *An Inconvenient Truth*, outlining possibly the most dangerous threat to our way of life since Dubya took the oath: global warming. In a compelling and easy to understand presentation, Mr. Gore's accumulated data illustrates how mankind's mass-production technology, coupled with bloating populations, has brought an artificial imbalance to an ecosystem which has been naturally balanced for billions of years, and is nothing short of an indictment against our wastefulness and shortsightedness. Analogous to Toffler's *Future Shock* (where successive generations are inundated with superseding technology faster than they can assimilate it), the shockwave of industrialization has attained a critical mass. Humans could never hope to actually "destroy the planet"; regarding Earth purely as a space rock, it will prevail, but - as Gore puts it - "the earth and our civilization are at war"; the key word being "civilization," i.e., the luxurious existence we take for granted.Fully realizing he can only squash so much harbingering into 100 minutes, Gore (who has given this presentation thousands of times across the country) focuses on the end results of decades of scientific studies, keeping it succinct and vital, with short asides on how his personal life slots into his crusade (to earn him substance that a mere lobbyist stance alone will not). Director Davis Guggenheim exerts a steady hand over the proceedings, re-discovering the beneficial uses of this medium which is so overtly misused. Yet even as we sit being educated, economic gears grind in adjacent theaters screening da Cruises, da Wolverines and da Vincis. You may not exit *Truth* as breathlessly as you may exit *X-Men: The Last Stand*, but you will be just as shaken.(Read this unabridged review at: www.poffysmoviemania.com/AnInconvenientTruth.html)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After viewing the movie, aside from contemplating its message and warnings, and heeding its obvious profundities I couldn't help but think, "what would George Bush's 'An Inconvenient Truth' movie be?"Ever notice how appealing people like Al Gore or John Kerry are when they're not being "handled" by their party's power base? Needless to say, one (anyone) could knit-pick and debate whether the photos comparing mountains or ice caps were the same time of the year, or comparable seasons, etc. But the thrust of Mr. Gore's presentation seemed irrefutable. Much reminded me of a 60 Minutes piece I saw a few weeks back A wise ad writer once wrote, "It's not nice to fool with Mother Nature."Let's hope we can put our political differences aside and heed this man's advice. Those not part of the solution are part of the problem.Period! Way more entertaining than I thought it would be. A definite must-see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This documentary not only demonstrates the truth of global warming, but the current and future consequences are laid out in such an understandable way.

As I sat watching his thoughtful presentation, I couldn't help but wonder what a better place the world would be had Gore been president for the last 5 1/2 years instead of George Bush ... may I tell you how much I despise the Bush Administration? Much of what was presented about global I have seen or read about before, but this documentary gets my highest marks for its graphics, photos, film clips and narrative. BTW, someone should hog tie Michael Crichton so he can watch the movie and be disabused about the reality of global warming.</fullReview>

Yes, there were quite a few charts and graphs, but they clearly illustrated the point that needed to be made. This path of potential destruction needs to be reversed, or we will only have ourselves to blame. The only thing that would be more devastating than the potential outcome is the fact that humanity has the means and the power to stop and even reverse the damage, yet took little if any action to do anything about it. This is not slanting information for anyone's profit or benefit. It's just statement of fact. I hope global and local action is taken- before it's too late.</fullReview>

Now, suddenly, there is a movie for all to see, that shames our ignorance and apathy, and questions our ability to do our moral duty. Al Gore loves this country, and, based on our history of rising to the occasion, he thinks that we, Americans, are capable of meeting the challenge. But he hasn't seen it yet. This movie removes all the obstacles keeping us from understanding the problem, removing the myths and false choices. All we need to do is watch it. Will this information enter into the sphere of the general public's consciousness? That is the question of the hour. If so, then, and only then, will there be the ability to make the necessary changes.Al Gore's charisma moved the majority of Americans in 2000, so let's hope he can do it again!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hope.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An artist hopes for one thing. Craftsmen do not hope; they merely make something, and sell it.A craftsman would be a music group like the band "Hot Hot Heat." They make a song, they make it so someone can listen to it, jump around to the beat of the song, relate to the lyrics on an emotional and philosophical level, and feel an emotion as an effect.One could use the verb "hope" in terms of a craftsmen in that, "They hope someone will like their song, and buy it, and that they can be famous, so they can have sex with lots of pretty girls who like to jump around to the beat of their music," but that would be not my usage of the word hope. I would say, "A craftsman wants someone to like their song, so they can get paid, and do what they like to do with their life." This is no different than Apple computers making their iPods the coolest and smallest they can make them. "Hot Hot Heat," whose music is quite fun and cool, and deserve all the pretty girls they can get, makes their songs as fun and cool as they can make them. It is NOT more vain that they just want someone to like their song, it is NOT immoral ; it is what most people do ; but it is without hope.All men need hope. Artist and craftsman. I need hope, and that is why i will remain an artist. Craftsmen find hope through other means. But an artist, through what he creates, hopes. Every sentence, note or brush stroke he produces can be translated to: i hope. What does he hope for ?An artist hopes for change.An artist hopes one who experiences what has been created he or she will not be able to live their life the same way after the fact. An artist does not necessarily try to create beauty, he does not necessarily try to create truth, he does not necessarily try to soothe OR stimulate ; an artist could chose any of these things, or he could chose none of them, but he chooses them to hope for change. Sometimes, this is small change in one's life. For example, the famous William Carlos Williams poem:so much depends upon a red wheelbarrowglazed in rain water beside the white chickens Now that you have read that poem, your life will be different in a very small way. You might say the word "chickens" with a slightly different feeling for the word. You might see red as a little more of an interesting color. You might notice the weight of the things you say, the heaviness of the syllables, the heaviness of the thoughts they bring, or you might just every so often mutter to yourself, "Beside the white chickens," because it has a pleasing sound to you. Williams does not care if you "like" his poem, if you would pay five dollars to have it read to you--for proof, read his collected letters to publishers. You may end up paying five dollars for it, but that is not his concern. He wants you to be different, he wants to toss you into the horror of his world, and make you understand it. He wants change.An artist is a terrorist. I paid five dollars today.I saw An Inconvenient Truth. It was art. It was a kind of art i do not often view, It was art whose materials were equal parts science, drama and truth. Like Williams' poem, it was hoping. But it hoped far beyond anything Williams ever wrote. It hoped with a child's mind, it hoped with a purity and a logic. And it changed me.I don't know who else in the small small matine audience it changed, but i hope it changed everyone in there. I cannot go on living my life in the same way. I mean this with sincerity i rarely know. I am weary with catharsis, i have cried and i have raged and i have hated, and now i am ready to move on. I am ready to be someone different. Starting with these words. I want you to like this review, and i know there are many reasons why you might not. For example, the style is very plain and may come off as careless ; and its logic might seem ill.But this review is art. To me.You may decide if it is bad art, but it will still be art. Because i wrote this in the that you will be changed after reading it, and you will go see An Inconvenient Truth tonight at seven at your local theater, instead of the Da Vinci Code, instead of Mission Impossible Three, instead of Garfield: A Tale of Two Kittens, instead of even another movie i have give a rave review to in the past. Even the movies that are listed as my all time favorites, i hope that you will see this first, and then them ; and i hope that you will be changed by it. I hope you will see that, if we do not change, we are truly doomed. And that is why i believe in art. That is why it is my God.Because it creates Change. The only thing that will save us. Nothing else will.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well Done, Impeccable Data, Incontrovertible Conclusions</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First let me say there has been a wonderful rebirth of the documentary film, beginning with Michael Moore. A well made documentary is now just as likely to draw a good crowd as the latest schlock from Hollywood.And that's good news.This film is spot-on one of the most important films ever made. It lays out the argument, building some pretty incontrovertible, direct correlations between the man-made build-up of CO2 gasses and the rise in the earth's temperature these last 14 years.One bit of data is already dated, though, and I wish they would have fixed it. In the film Gore discusses a core ice sample taken in Antarctica that gives a representation of atmospheric CO2 roughly half a million years ago. It showed no comparable period of CO2 buildup in all that time. And Gore says it goes back the farthest of any study. In the last several weeks, the results of an Arctic ice sample going back 50+ million years ago were published. The conclusion was that green house gases do heat up the earth, as they are doing now, causing the Arctic and Antarctic ices to melt. There can be other reasons for warm ups, but clearly green house gasses are involved and appear to be the principle cause.As you read the reviews of the film, you will likely encounter right- and left-wing politics galore. Just a few days ago the White House decided to cut NASA's funding for global warming studies. They don't like the conclusions so, like in all totalitarian countries, they make the problem "go away" by ignoring it.Except this is a problem that won't be politicked or ignored.It's not something public opinion or voting can change.Global warming either is or is not happening. Warming's root cause either is or is not being created now by human CO2 emissions from our technologies. Warming will or will not slowly cook and boil the earth, compromising the ability of the planet to sustain life.If those who agree with data are wrong, then nothing bad will happen by cutting back on CO2 gas production. If anything, the technological revolution created to stop CO2 emissions will be great for all economies, creating new jobs.If those who disagree, based on God knows what, that the earth is not warming due to these reasons and they are wrong, we're cooked. Literally.For American businesses, if the rest of the world perceives, rightly or wrongly, that the American automobile is a principle cause of the warming, they will stop buying our stuff. We will have one less good to export. Our trade deficit will bleed the country dry of capital that much faster, sinking us deeper and deeper into economic ruin. As it is, Gore illustrates that we have a tough time selling into the rest of the world because its MPG standards are out of reach of American cars. This is not good for America as an economic power.We can't afford to be wrong about this, either ecologically or economically. And Al Gore's film explains why not.Go see it. Left or right, rich or poor, science-minded or religious, go see it. And pray.</fullReview>

The movie begins with a very well thought out Powerpoint presentation given in a lecture hall setting and switches between exotic locations showing signs of global warming and shots of different periods in Gore's life. I was not aware of this, but Gore has been working most of his life towards preserving the environment, starting when he was a boy, continuing through his years in the Senate and culminating in his two terms as vice president. While presenting the information, Gore even cracks several jokes about the 2000 presidential election, showing that he holds no grudges and has moved on to an endeavor that can do so much more for the people of the United States and the rest of the world: bring the subject of global warming to the forefront of public consciousness so it can be halted before it is too late!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"An Inconvenient Truth" is a 90 minute environmental science lecture delivered by Al Gore. You'll laugh, you'll think, you'll eat popcorn. You've done worse things with 90 minutes. And no -- I don't think he's planning to run in 2008. Global warming is indeed a theory. So is gravity. Gore argues that the connection is the speed of the consequences if you choose to ignore them. You know what happens when you ignore gravity. Things have changed enough that the consequences of ignoring climate changes are hitting us just as hard and fast -- more tornadoes, more hurricanes, more droughts. I was blown away by Gore's lecture, but apparently the fossil fuel industry execs were even more blown away than I was. They've started running attack ads, and are spending a fortune to convince you and the people around you to ignore this movie, and ignore this issue. Their mantra is that there's nothing wrong -- go back to sleep. Remember, there's no link between tobacco and cancer. There's no relationship between diet and obesity, diabetes, high blood pressure, and heart attacks. There's no such thing as acid rain. Wiretapping your phone keeps you free from tyranny. Plants convert carbon dioxide into oxygen, so there's no way that carbon dioxide can be an environmental problem. Oceans are so big that they don't change temperature. Glaciers melt all the time, and then they reform. It's all normal. There's nothing wrong. Everything is under control. Go back to sleep. There's an old saying in Tennessee - I know it's in Texas, it's probably in Tennessee - that says, fool me once, shame on ... shame on you. It fool me. Fool me twice and ... you don't .... you don't get fooled again.So get in your SUV and go see An Inconvenient Truth -- take your kids. Get everyone you know to see this movie. Get them to get everyone they know to see this movie. You've done worse things with 90 minutes.Think about the data. Draw your own conclusions. Decide on your own course of action.

		<fullReview>First off, the people here quoting their facts obviously haven't seen the movie. They disagree with the scientific consensus on global warming and are pushing their half-baked ideas that they have been fed upon the general public.Global warming isn't a political issue. It affects us all, Democrats and Republicans, Liberals and Conservatives and everyone in between and to either side. The scientific opinion is clearly on the side of global warming, and I'm sure the scientists who write peer reviewed papers are far more qualified to comment on this manner than people sitting at their keyboards ranting about grapes in England grown by the Romans.Getting back to the movie, I highly recommend it. It's wonderful and caused tremendous introspection. Upon coming home, I went to the website and took a quiz and realized that I emit about 25% more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere than the average citizen. This movie has caused me to set a goal for myself, to evaluate every aspect of my life so that I can minimize my impact. If nothing else, the movie will make you think and in this day and age when we are fed pre-processed, pre-chewed information by the media, anything that makes us think is a good thing.There are of course those people who will claim that the Earth's changes in temperature and the change in CO2 levels in the atmosphere is solely due to natural, geologic events; however, that point has been addressed in the movie and by scientists. Ultimately, if you enter the theater with a closed mind, then you might as well have saved the eight bucks. Go only if you are willing to open your mind.</fullReview>

I expected a filmed lecture, somewhat dry and humorless. However the film is an emotional experience. Its logic is cold and merciless, its material grips and its anecdote chills. Despite this, the film is not perfect. There are cartoon sequences that condescend to the viewer and some (understanble) partisan swipes at Kathleen Harris.

		<shortDescription>Necessary Viewing and quite possibly the most important film I've ever seen.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wow.When my friend and I left the theater having seen this movie, a highly illuminative and inspiring science documentary which doesn't bore you for even a nanosecond and makes for highly compelling viewing, we had to take a moment to remind ourselves of the importance of what we had just seen. Throughout, both of us had gasped along with the rest of the audience numerous times, in surprise, understanding and horror. Images we'd seen had shocked us out of apathy. Insurmountable logic leapt with stunning clarity into open mouths and wide eyes. The entire audience gave the film an ovation and applause when it was completed, and no one leaving would forget the website that the film leaves behind where more information on global warming and what we could do to stop it, could be found.Yet still, we knew we had to take a second, collect ourselves, and agree to never forget just how horrifying the threat was. Once we left the theater, it was easy, having been conditioned to see images of all sorts of things in movie theaters, to kind of let it wash right out of us, and to allow the dire importance of what we'd felt and seen to diminish with the fading of the immediacy of the picture itself. We pledged not to allow this to happen; to drag every friend we knew. The threats we saw were too real to leave behind in the dark theater.I cannot recommend this movie enough. If it is tempting for someone who just saw it to exhale when its done, and allow apathy to creep back in, imagine how impossible the effort is to move people who weren't in the theater to understand what's at stake? In the hectic lives we lead, who has time to look into this? Information comes from all angles. People have many agendas.This movie transcends all that. It transcends typical film critiques. Attacking its style, or editorial choices, is worthwhile in only a tangential fashion. This is not a movie that has to please or impress like any other. Simply its being as a conduit for vital information in a way that is highly accessible and engrossing is justification enough for the highest possible rating on any objective cinema scale.This movie is doing you a favor. Now do yourselves and (if you have them) your kids some justice, go to the movies, and prepare to change the way you live for the betterment and preservation of mankind itself. This movie is ultimately an inspiring call to activism and to inquisitiveness; as such, it will be a rousing success.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A documentary worth noting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>for its complete lack of basis in truth. I give it a "10" simply because it is a perfect embodiment of the Clinton Era- a time when the definition of any particular word or event could, and often was, arbitrarily ignored and replaced with something more convenient for that moment.As a side note: it is interesting to see that the latest marketing efforts have removed any apparent reference to the "star" Al Gore himself. Perhaps he wishes to remain humble as the Crusader for Global Warming- after all, we have already come to recognize him as the Creator of the Internet.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is not a political movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This documentary is a great piece, and is something everyone should watch. Those who care for the environment, and even those who hate the environment. This isn't a liberal or conservative thing, it boils down to money, and how the corporations dictate our lives, the things government can control. Our money! You don't think they can charge less for gas?? C'mon.The real reason why environment doesn't seem to affect many as it should is because its a thing we don't notice. You can't tell how much the smog hurts your lungs. Don't bring up age expectancy and tell me its better than it was pre-industry, because through technology, we are getting to live older, but our health is horrible, and the environment has a lot to do with it. I've been to other continents, and a place like Europe, has cheap, great food, with no hormones just so the huge corporation can make billions at the cost of our health. It's you do for me, I do for you. Republicans (regardless of their feelings on the environment) are held up by strings by the biggest industrialists of the nation, and the Democrats (some), who speak for better regulation will get peanuts to run with.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The earth's primary problem was not forcefully stated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>And that primary problem is overpopulation. Yes, Gore touched on it but it is undeniable to or by anyone with half a brain that we are producing way too many people much too quickly for this earth to maintain in health and prosperity. The earth is finite, but the rapidly reproducing number of humans on it is not. This problem will reach the tipping point soon as humans continue to reproduce until the earth will accept no more and will then tell them in a severe language they are certain to understand....death on a massive scale if not total annihilation. This will occur, in many scientific opinions, within the next 100 years at the present rate of earth destruction. And, when this happens, the earth will cease to be livable, and remain unlivable for thousands of years if not forever. That harsh truth is what needs to be said by Gore or anyone else, as even though Gore's message was tough in other points, it did soft peddle the real truth about overpopulation which is much, much worse than what he did say. We are killing the earth more each day with our increasing billions, and the punishment for doing so is not that many years away. But, even with that truth facing us we humans still only care about today, as moronic as that unconcern is. Even conservation groups such as the Sierra Club won't object to massive illegal immigration and its mass overpopulation affects on the US environment as that reasonable and rational stance may turn off potential future paying members. What a complete sell out for money, and from a group whose self-proclaimed mission is to deal with serious earth preservation problems(but, of course, not illegal immigrant overpopulation!)that humans alone have caused.Almost all of the earth's atmospheric and ground pollution problems have resulted since the Industrial Revolution began 200 years ago, which is no more than a blip on the radar of human history so it is scientifically clear that the earth would still be as healthy as Eden if man didn't evolve his inventive brain which is causing all of our overpopulated "advanced civilization" problems and which, as it developed, seemed to force out the "earth as our beloved mother" inherent concept of balanced and adoring coexistence that was so crucial and spiritual to indigenous peoples who never damaged, and never would damage, their own "mother earth" as modern man has. What an apocalyptic shame that modern man lost that life nurturing concept as his brain became more material-seeking and selfishness-enslaved over time.Our own great-grandchildren may not be able to even exist on our polluted earth in 100 years, much less be able to live as we do today. As Gore said, humans do not respond at all to subtle messages, and the earth's climate changes are, very unfortunately, humanly perceived as subtle and not crucial to them this very minute which is only what they respond to, and are definitely not seen with the same concern as are earthquakes, tsunamis, hurricanes, floods, droughts, volcanoes and the like which are certainly not subtle and can quickly kill in large numbers. Perhaps God, if there is or ever was a God, should change the way he gives us severe wake-up calls about how we are treating the earth, and make those messages like those mighty tragedies told in the Bible. Now, those catastrophic messages we would heed, but everything else, hey, forget it, as "we're busy having way too much fun right now so let our grandkids deal with it. Party on!" Gore's film was effective in what he did say, and at least he is saying something helpful, but he didn't speak enough about the real cause of the earth's troubles surely due to the damage it would cause him politically to shout that "the problem with our earth, the only real problem, is that there are just too damn many people on it! Now, let's talk about what we can do about that and then do it!" That would be the world's toughest job, and I hope it is not too late for any success there to save the earth for human life. And, we will end it all, as we want to always live as we are now living....we just can't seem to help ourselves no matter the later cost to our own flesh and blood!Another thing...Gore has four kids(I have one). So, how much can he chastise others about overpopulation when he and his wife have replaced themselves not once but twice(to be fair, this happened before he became earth enlightened)? I'm sure that's why he was not forceful enough on the catastrophe of world overpopulation, and he lost some serious credibility in my mind and heart as a result. I am glad that Gore is saying what he is saying about earth destruction but remember, he is a politician first and foremost. You may agree or disagree with how I have reviewed this film, but you cannot disagree that our earth is in its early death throes totally due to human-caused damage in the last 200 years. There is still a chance that we can help it last longer but we all must start by reducing our personal impact on the earth now. Are you going to help now, or just see films like this one for diversion and then uncaringly continue to contribute to the end of all worldly life by living just as you have all your wasteful lives? Start to really care.(The negatives here on my call-to-action review seems to show that few people truly care at all about what happens to this earth if it means changing the way THEY live. We will pay a big price as a result of that selfish unconcern. Most of you will personally see the harsh consequences of your unconcern. And, you will deserve it.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The reaction by some people is more scary than the movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Firstly, I have only seen the trailer - it is not out in my country yet - but from what I have seen it appears to be a very timely movie - even if it only restates the evidence. I will put forward another review once I have watched it in full.I am writing after having read some of the comments. This is not a political issue - it is a matter of evidence and science ? and yes I am sure it is being used as a political football in America just as it is in Australia and therefore the science gets obscured by the hired guns on both sides for political purposes. However, that aside I am simply amazed by the complete inability of some of these folks to actually look at this issue objectively.Global Warming is a theory - we also have Global Dimming ? another theory - caused by smog and particulate build up in the atmosphere (although the thinking of some of those who have commented may be adding to the particulate matter build up). Theories can be disproved and I am sure any scientist true to his name would be prepared to drop either theory if there was sufficient evidence to the contrary. However, to date there is, and has been an enormous build up of evidence for climate change on an unprecedented scale - the evidence continues to build and for most of us we are living the massive changes in climate first hand. They are about to launch a whole new category of Hurricane/Tornado/Cyclone because they are becoming more intense than the previous scale. In the 80's you could easily mount a case that this was simply a natural cyclic change - but today the evidence is overwhelming that the change has been dramatic and the greatest in hundreds of thousands of years. Even the insurance companies are feeling the effects. Thinking as citizens of the planet and as the human race is the only way we can tackle these global problems. Yet even this threat is treated as fodder for political point scoring.</fullReview>

Go to climate-crisis.net Watch trailers downloads Go to rottentomatoes.com extra clips from ifilm with interviews of cast members. I hope a lot of conservatives see this. Besides taking care of the earth and not wasting our resources is being conservative, hence conservation. I am a bit weary of Al Gore, and I hope he does not blow it in this film. The bottom line is that global warming is a major crisis. We as a global community must unite. It sounds kinda cool for the world to get together and fight pollution and global warming. Like a futuristic sci-fi, where a counsel of earth's nations gather in some space bubble overlooking the pacific ocean, and all harmonize on non-selfish ways to save the earth for the greater good of man-kind and nature. Drag a lot of people to this. This is the real Mission Impossible.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great message... not so entertaining... but still great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is what people need to see here and now. It should be mandatory viewing for every 8th grade student in the country. Sure it may be boring at times and some of it may be over-dramatized but its heart is in the right place and we can only hope that the American public will be smart enough to understand the problem now that it has been spelled out to them in a (overly) simplistic way.Gore's keynote slide show is the outstanding centerpiece of the film. It moves logically and smoothly from point to point involving insightful examples as it covers a large breadth of information. Also, who knew that the guy could be so funny... six years ago I thought he was made of mahogany and here he is talking about a cartoon frog?! Go figure... but the humor is not to be missed. On the negative side, I must say that some of the sections about Gore's personal life were over the top and, for many, probably unnecessary. However, the fact that Gore came from a ranch and has a strong family life will lend him credibility in the "that guy has a pickup truck and a ranch... and i like both of those things- therefore he should be the president" camp. In a nutshell: this film is not about entertainment. It is not about feeling guilty. If it works correctly and you are 9.9/10 Americans then you will leave the theatre feeling as bad as I did. Hopefully though, you will also feel hopeful and empowered because ultimately, it is you and I who can solve the problems that this film addresses.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In this movie Al Gore presents us with his views regarding the issue of global warming and convincing evidence to back up his assertions. He does so earnestly and with great passion. The movie is very well crafted and keeps you interested all the way through. It is well worth seeing and hopefully it will lead the viewers to become more involved in the issues and investigate them for themselves.Speaking as a space scientist, a skeptic, and a someone with an open mind I did not find any fault with his aims. The flaws in the movie are what he did not state, and that there is no counter-point. I would have liked to have seen a few interviews with people who disagreed with his main points. I also think he should have pointed out that the increase in carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has been historically preceded by an increase in temperature and not the other way around. Brushing this major issue under the carpet had me wondering what else he left out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Convincing Argument Against Fossil Fuels</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Quite simply, the more CO2 there is in our atmosphere, the warmer our planet gets. Period.Lower the carbon dioxide level, and the earth cools.This is not rocket science; it's blatantly simple.Al Gore compares the current 'doubts' about global warming to the old 'doubts' whether smoking was harmful to one's health. Oil companies, just like tobacco companies before them, have a strong will to survive - so they create a 'doubt' campaign. Gore says 100% of scientists say that Global Warming is real, however - 54% of news articles on the subject, present the idea of Global Warming as 'doubtful.' After seeing then-and-now photo comparisons of melting ice shelfs and glaciers around the world - the severity of our current situation becomes obvious.Gore goes out of his way to avoid Bush-bashing. Making this a political film would be counter-productive. Yet, the fact that the Bush family has strong ties to oil remains impossible to hide. The current Administration states that lowering emissions will hurt our economy. Gore smugly points out: without a planet, there is no economy. Fortunately, individual states are taking their own initiative to follow guidelines listed in the Kyoto Treaty, to prove that it can be done.The film concentrates on Gore's traveling 'slideshow' presentation, and then periodically inserts some of his biographical details - to serve as an intermission between lecture sessions. This way, the film never becomes monotonous.The case he makes is overwhelming. Unfortunately, Gore only lightly touches on what we can do about this problem. The bulk of his pro-active suggestions are not presented until the end credits of the movie.His suggestions? Consume less energy. Use hybrid vehicles. Recycle.More ideas can be found at the movie's website: www.climatecrisis.net</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the most important movies ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is so incredible. Al Gore explains in a very accessible way the science of climate change, why global warming matters, and makes an argument that is impossible to ignore. It is all based on science. His presentation is positive and easy to understand. The graphics he uses are incredible as well-- both visually and informationally. No credible scientist disagrees that humans have had a dramatic impact on changing the climate of this planet. Yet the general media, perhaps in its attempt to be 'balanced' or for some sinister reason, present this as something still in dispute. While the movie is about some very overwhelming and sobering things, it is presented in an inspiring and motivating way. For those who don't believe in climate change or for those that want to learn more, this movie is a must. And, seeing it will have the added impact of making a statement to business and government that you take this seriously and that action must be taken immediately. We don't need to change the quality of our lives to address global warming, but if we don't address it, the quality of our lives will surely be changed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There is a growing question of "Why Al Gore?" The reason for Al Gore is because it is not a movie solely about global warning, but a documentary on Al Gore's attempt to convey the message of global warming. People who speculate that the movie is being used as a political ploy could be correct, but he simply provided all the evidence leading to global warming that he has collected throughout his career. Al Gore has stated that he does not plan on running for office in 08 according to ABC News, so that point of political gain looses credit. The movie was great and it will likely win over some critics to change their mind.</fullReview>

He has been giving this presentation for free and has given it over 1000 times to teach people about Global Warming and what is going to happen if we don't take action. He didn't want to make it into a movie, but was convinced by the producers to do so, so that it could reach a wider audience.

Anyway all I can say is this documentary gives me chicken skin already, and it's a welcome relief to have an eloquent speaker with a great voice such as Al Gore.He doesn't sensationalize the issue and thus it gives more credibility to the documentary and the cause he's been passionate about. I used to not like Al Gore so much in 92, but I have a lot of more respect for the guy.Who cares he "used to be the next president of the United States" or as some would call it here, the "loser in chief". What matters is the important cause he's fighting for, and that should inspire people to do the same and for some, to realize how they are locked-in in a world of categorizations and non-sense... words such as losers, patriots, traitors, they all come from the same narrow minded and indoctrinated people who can't see reality for what it is, or as it is."An inconvenient truth", however inconvenient it will prove for millions of Americans to watch it and let it sink in, will hopefully serve its purpose towards the inevitable shift away from oil energy and towards greater and greater awareness of and responsibility towards the fragile balance of our ecosystem on which we all depend for our existence.</fullReview>

I'm rating this movie based on entertainment value because anyone with the slightest scientific background past high school would file this film under fiction as well, along with X-men 3. Global warming doesn't exist, it's just environmental hysteria. There are multiple points in the film that are Michael Moorish in value as they are opinions trying to be played off as fact, merely by presenting them as fact. I'd mention specifics about the film that are blatantly wrong, but I don't want to "spoil" the surprise for any of you who have a scientific education. If you are a fan of true science, you may also want to file this under comedy. I had a few good laughs, seeing Al Gore with a serious look on his face whilst describing "travesties" that do not exist, or describing why something bad is going to happen. I'm sure he had extensive classes in environmental studies when he was getting his Bachelor of Arts degree in government. I'm pretty sure that's a science heavy degree. Oh, and it's pretty surprising that a guy who "invented the internet" and was the Senior adviser to Google, still doesn't seem to have the basic research skills to look something up on the internet and see why scientific data supports the fact that there is no global warming problem.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Problem with the Global Warming Crowd</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Environmental movement was extremely successful in cleaning up the air and the water. So successful in fact that the Environmental Lobby was faced with a hard question: What next? After all, those jobs would disappear if some new "environmental emergency" was not discovered before the money ran dry.With that, the environmental lobby turned its attention to "Global Warming" and engineered a Big Scare designed to keep it in business for the next 200 years. After all, what is better than a "problem" that may take centuries to manifest itself.Next on the list was to line up scientists to support this thesis. Not too difficult given that research grants would flow (note that i'm not against weather research - it's certainly a worthy endeavor).Next step, call those self-interested scientists a "Concensus" and convince generally science-illiterate politicians that this was a "crisis" of enormous gravity, even though there may or may not be any effect until centuries from now.Buttress all those theories with "computer models", which can be made to show anything, and as the local weather report shows us can't be trusted to predict the weather a week from now, and then you have a so-called "scientifically proved" fact, based only on suppositions and projections (and pretty much anything based on projections is bound to be proved false).Which leads us finally to Al Gore's movie. The strange thing about it is that Al Gore is not scientifically illiterate. He's a rather bright guy, or at least he was when he wrote Earth in the Balance, which I found quite interesting and well-researched.What has led Al Gore to become one of those Global Warming activists, for whom Global Warming is a quasi-religion would make a great movie, certainly a more compelling movie than the half-truths presented in this one.The reality is that we don't know if there is a global warming occurring. We don't know if the global warming that is supposedly occurring is countervailing a new ice age which may or may not be upon us (which would be a good thing) or if we are at a tipping point, as the alarmists claim.The reality is that we don't know much about global weather patterns, no matter how many articles crucify anyone that dares say the contrary (by the way, isn't it interesting how scientists who don't buy int other Global Warming craze are labeled "shills of the industry", when the Global Warming supporters are "independent" even when they benefit from big research grants generated by their work...).And I expected more from Al Gore than this mish-mash.Seeing this movie made me feel that if he were elected, there's a good chance Al Gore would become a Democratic Richard Nixon. He just seems to have lost it the same way Nixon did after he lost the election to Kennedy in similar circumstances.</fullReview>

The stark contrast in the first sentence is a lot like the contrast in the reviews of this movie (odd that this movie has not been released at the time of this review, and there are already reviews of it.) People already love it or they hate it. This contrast is also seen in people's views of the subject of this movie, man's influence on Global Warming.I would think that everyone would draw a connection between carbon dioxide trapping heat in our atmosphere, and all the CO2 released by man's burning of fossil fuels, but this concept is proving a tough sell for many Americans. But we pay little attention to people who believe the Earth is Flat, why should the camp who claim the burning of millions of barrels of oil a day has no effect on the environment receive more time allowed to the Flat Earthers? What I want to see from this movie is a solution. Since the 1980s I have heard Global Warming is happening, and from endless headlines like "January 2006, warmest January in recorded History" I am sold. Closing my eyes, and covering my ears is an option for some (especially those in the business of selling fossil fuels) but this is not an option for me. I want to do something to cut emissions of CO2, at least to 1970s levels, and I hope this film will show me how.I will write a part 2 after I see this movie on opening day.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Al Gore hits the big screen with a sham "documentary" about global warming, and it typifies everything that is wrong about Al Gore - his arrogant condescension, his oblivious attitude toward common sense, and a trait he shares with the rest of the intelligentsia - self-appointment to "take charge" of a crisis.Gore lays on thickly about "moral choices," noting how a relative died of lung cancer and thus forced his family out of the tobacco-farming business, as if that relative's own personal choices were somehow forced by the Gore family's tobacco farming. This, though, isn't rational thinking or policy prescription, it is the knee-jerk thinking of someone without the courage of facing the big picture.Global warming does not exist. This is the inconvenient fact the film leaves out. All the "evidence" to support the notion of global warming ultimately collapses because of the reality that warming and cooling cycles are geological routine. Scare stories about melting glaciers are just scare stories, not real science or even relevant to anything. That the sun has hundreds of thousands of times more effect on planetary conditions than the entirety of Man's production of "greenhouse" gases over millions of years further discredits the entire global warming mantra. That the same panic over global warming was applied barely 25 years ago to an pending new Ice Age is also overlooked by the film.Nor does the film bother to wonder that the net result of any global warming might actually be for the planet's betterment, in the form of increased plant growth and improved environment for Man and animals.There is scare talk about how the US has not signed the Kyoto Treaty, never mind that virtually no nation that did sign it actually adheres to it. And it all becomes too much for the rational viewer to stand.There is no global warming, and to acknowledge this fact would eliminate any reason for the film (beyond feeding Al Gore's grotesque sense of self-worth) to begin with. Thus has the documentary genre continued to erode.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Don't wait for the DVD or global warming! And certainly don't bring your friends! Why would you wait for global warming to end the world when you could just go see a 'documentary' with Al Gore as himself?!? If sitting through this political pornography for an hour and a half doesn't make you wish to have a meteor come screaming out of space and slam into the Earth and put you out of your misery, nothing will!! Global warming (or global climate change as the kids are starting to call it) is as real as the mutant threat facing America. And with that said, go see X-Men tomorrow!! Movies, at least the ones we pay to see should entertain, not indoctrinate. Especially on Labor Day weekend. But if you're the kind of person that would rather go listen to a whack job, not to mention one of history's biggest losers, like Gore rant and rave on a three day weekend then maybe that meteor needs to hurry up.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Oh great, an entire film of Al Gore carrying on about some imagined crisis that REQUIRES, no, that DEMANDS massive government action! Oh puh-leaze! Al Gore never found a problem that didn't require bigger government and more taxpayer money. This time it's about the so-called Global Warming Crisis! I hate to rain on his parade but, there is no crisis. Global warming is real alright - but it's a natural thing that has been going on in cycles for billions of years. It is the height of arrogance to link the current natural cycle to human activity. Ah, but Al Gore is nothing if not arrogant. And sanctimonious. And on a crusade. And the facts be damned! Never mind that the reason the Earth is warming up recently is because the Sun has been putting out more energy of late. Oh no, it must - of course - be due to mankind's e-vile efforts. Of course! And the solution must, of course, be more big government to save us from ourselves! What crap. What amazes me is that people are still listening to this blowhard and taking him seriously. I mean, hell, this guy couldn't even beat George Bush! And now he's off on some crusade in response to a crisis that doesn't exist, is not our fault, and is just part of a natural cycle? And people are paying money to watch this guy rant and rave? And Democrats say Republicans are stupid for voting for Bush? This movie, in a word, sucks. More overly pious, overly sanctimonious, overly sensationalistic propaganda that is high on alarmism and awfully, awfully short on facts. If this is what Al Gore truly believes than I'm actually thankful that he lost back in 2000 even though that meant we had to put up with the likes of Bush in his stead. Sure, go see this film if you already BELIEVE in the CAUSE as you're already way past the point where mere facts will have any effect on you. But if you don't want to be preached at for 100 minutes by some cosmic level blowhard then save yourself the $8.50 and avoid this film like the plague.</fullReview>
