		<fullReview>The acting was solid. The production value was superb. Everything else was really poor.The back story and character motivations are laughably sparse. Most of the characters are completely one-dimensional, with the possible exception of Loki. The plot is the most boring and typical of all action plots - some "bad dudes who happen to be really ugly" decide to "destroy the world for no reason other than being evil" and "only our hero can save us all", etc. Moreover, it was lazy writing - whenever an absolute miracle needed to happen, it conveniently did, every time. Of course this is a mindless blockbuster Marvel movie so we shouldn't expect much. But the thing is that these kinds of films CAN be made with a reasonable plot, pacing, and character development. The writers were obviously just going through the motions to cash in on the surefire moneymaker sequel, and from a business perspective it is hard to fault them. But it says a lot about the sad state of Hollywood in 2013 that this film currently has a 7.7 on IMDb.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Worst Film Of The Year. Loud, Obnoxious and All Over The Place.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Go ahead and find this review not useful. But listen to me. I love Marvel films. The Original Spider-man Trilogy was amazing and The Avengers was awesome. But when I saw Iron Man 3 I was bored out of my mind and I felt it was not good. So I lowered my expectations for this movie and hoped it would be better right? Because from what I learned, the lower the expectations, the better the movie. Big Mistake.Thor The Dark World is all over the map with scenes of badly choreographed action scenes to bad comedy to laughable acting.I really wanted to like this film because I liked the original Thor. It was really good and it was directed by Kenneth B. who is the man who made The best adaptation of Hamlet Ever. But the movie suffers from production troubles to a bad script.The Film begins with this super magic thing called the Ether... I think which causes destruction. They find it and this one guy says "Lets Destroy it." but this other guy says "ITS TOO POWERFUL! We must put it in a place where it is easily touchable!" I knew this was going to be a bad film because the beginning suffers from cliché after cliché.Thor returns to Earth because Jane gets the Ether in her and they must heal her. The Dark Elves who are the bad guys for the film attack Thor's planet and the main baddie tries to line up the main 9 planets and cause darkness everywhere. Thor gets Loki from Prison and they go stop the evil baddie.The script and direction are extremely weak. The script sucks because the dialogue is horrendous. The acting is hilarious from Anthony Hopkins as Odin as he overacts a lot in this movie.The action scenes are poorly choreographed and make no sense.Also, Heroes should have weaknesses. Thor nearly throughout the whole Has none. Why should we care if they are unstoppable without any weaknesses, that takes away the credibility of the character.Also, this teleporting plot line makes no sense. They go nearly everywhere in this movie. In the final fight scene fall everywhere going back from place to place. They never explain why these teleports are randomly put all over the map but it really annoys me.The jokes... oh my god. They are so unfunny. Who cares if the Professor guy's pants are not on? Bad comedy has to be understood and this movie doesn't understand comedy. The character of Darcy is obnoxious. She was alright in the first but she always has to say HOLY SH*T 500 times a scene.The special effects are alright but its not always about the effects. One effect actually hurt my eyes and I didn't know if it was the 3D or if my eyes just hurt.There are very few good things about this movie. The guy who plays Loki is one of the only redeeming qualities of this movie and he is very convincing. The Stan Lee Cameo is also great and funny like always. There is a awesome twist I wont spoil. But that's about it.This movie is just super loud in its bad action scenes are poor acting and ear bleeding sound effects.Thor The Dark World is the worst movie of the year without a doubt. I was disappointed severely. Marvel can be much better then this and I hope Captain America The Winter Soldier does a better job at being a better superhero movie.25/100 D</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Even more shallow than the first.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The plot barely exists for this film. Generic evil people try to take over universe, Thor stops them, the end. Which might have been alright but there was very little action in this mindless action film. What little fighting we got was poorly orchestrated and repetitive.The dialogue is wooden and adds nothing. The characters with the exception of Loki have no depth and only exist as an assortment of clichés. Hiddleston makes for a great Loki but that is literally the only good or interesting thing in the entire film.Thor continues to be the worst Marvel movie franchise and Hemsworth is possibly the worst actor to ever star in multiple major movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Completely on autopilot...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me start by saying that I don't hate superhero films. I like them very much when they are done well. I hate laziness in films and superficiality. The problem is that pretty much every superhero film made is very lazy and most of them are entirely superficial. Marvel's initial idea of an Avengers universe was inspired from a marketing stand point but I am beginning to question whether or not it has been a failure from a creative stand point. 'Thor the Dark World' is a terrible movie. It does absolutely nothing to add to the mythos of the character or this Marvel universe. The only reason it exists is to draw up excitement for the next Avengers film. There are no stakes to this film and there are a lot of places to direct blame. The acting aside from Tom Hiddleston is next to unwatchable. The thing is that this is a very talented cast we are working with here. Anthony Hopkins and Natalie Portman have both won Academy Awards. Stellan Skarsgard is one of the most fascinating character actors in Hollywood. I like Hemsworth a lot too and thought he was great in the first 'Thor' film. But none of them invest anything in the material. Hopkins looks bored and emotes nothing in his delivery. Portman's performance is terrible too and in the process of it being terrible it makes a terrible script look even worse. Jane Foster is a horrible character here. She is by far the stupidest damsel in distress portrayed in comic books recently. Portman is too lazy to give her any sort of character. She punctuates every cheap joke and many of them are just about how ditsy the character is. This kind of writing and performance make me almost agree that comic books offer a flawed and stereotypical depiction of women. Stellan Skarsgard, an actor I think has great depth, is played as a complete fool here. I hated every time he appeared on screen and I am a Stellan Skarsgard fan. I don't place the blame all on him but yeah everyone here did something very wrong in bringing these stupidly conceived characters to life.In actuality though they are not the biggest problem with the film. The problem is that there is no threat to anything or anyone. The villain here is so completely forgettable and has a plan for evil so half assed that they movie really had no chance of working. This is the ultimate example of a conflict for the sake of having a conflict. If actor Christopher Eccleston is not rewarded a Razzie for his portrayal here than that award show has lost all credibility. Villains even poorly written ones with no motivation like this Maleketh should at least offer the actor the chance to try to ham it up with the tropes of goofy villainy. Eccleston doesn't do that. He has a boring calm delivery that evokes no response but laughter. And since Eccleston's performance is such an overwhelming failure I was drawn to how stupid his make-up looked too. I wish I could give this a bomb rating, I really do. To be honest though Tom Hiddleston is too damn good in the Loki role to say the film is completely without merit. They don't do anything new with his character here but he's so entertaining and in every Marvel film he adds new layers and nuances to a very interesting character. A whole movie could have been made about this stage of Loki's life and it would have been so much more entertaining and compelling than this load of work. Hiddleston portrays Loki as unchained with no loyalty to anyone. This is the first film where we see him as a trickster and Hiddleston delivers suffice to say. The problem is he isn't really in the film long enough. Jane Foster, Darcy, and Dr Selvig all get more screen time than Loki. Here's my brilliant business proposition to Marvel. Don't make any movies but Avengers films. Give your golden boy Joss Whedon the four hundred or so million you spent on 'Iron Man 3' and 'Thor the Dark World' and see what he does with it. In watching 'Iron Man 3' and this film it is clear that is where the mindset and passion are. I hope the Marvel cinematic universe can be saved but I have to say that their track record is looking really bad right now. Kevin Feige and Disney should look back at Favareu's first 'Iron Man' film. It was gutsy and took risks and there was no guarantee of immediate endless sequels.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's time that comic book fans started to demand more from these films before the entire genre evaporates into a disposable, commercialised heap like it does here</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Thor: The Dark World left me wondering why for all its popularity and box office hype the superhero genre so regularly fails to ignite the faintest trace of excitement and imagination in its narrative and storytelling. This sequel, following Kenneth Branagh's reasonably funny 2011 film, was written by no less than five writers, who between them have only mustered another dull, achingly generic story about saving the world. Aside from less than a handful of funny self-referencing points, this is a hugely disappointing by the numbers blockbuster that under services its embarrassingly rich cast and offers its enormous fanbase too little that is challenging, inspired or even surprising. What's confusing about the deliberate complacency in the script is that it's entirely unnecessary. There is no financial risk to comic book adaptations anymore to justify this kind of dumbing down. Earlier this year, Iron Man 3 became one of the top five highest grossing films of all time. While Christopher Nolan's Batman films have achieved financial success without succumbing to simplified narrative lines. Some even complained The Dark Knight Rises had too many story threads. How many filmmakers today would crawl over broken glass for a cast featuring Chris Hemsworth, Natalie Portman, Anthony Hopkins, Idris Elba, Tom Hiddleston, Chris O'Dowd and Stellan Skarsgard? With such talent it's not unreasonable then to ask for more than obligatory special effects and indistinguishable villains, who are included only to prop up pseudo- scientific plot points. Little effort has been exhausted into humanising these characters. Thor (Hemsworth) is a blank slate who swings his hammer and growls at people. It makes Chris Hemsworth look like a boring actor when we've seen how charismatic he can be, like he was in Rush, with the right material and director. There are fewer fish out of water jokes that I enjoyed in the first film. Natalie Portman, normally a delightful, charming actress, is embarrassed here as Thor's girlfriend, playing a character devoid of plausible emotional responses and desires. Her first reaction after being warped from London to Asgard is to say "Hi!" and "Let's do that again!" Never mind that her skin is now infected with the Aether, a weapon of mass destruction from an ancient group called the Dark Elves (who speak perfect English no less). She's more impressed that Thor told his dad about her! The Dark Elves are led by Malekith (Christopher Eccleston), who wants to use the Aether to destroy the world. Comic book films rise and fall on the quality of their villains. The Dark World has two, both of whom are substandard. The Dark Elves, branding swords and laser weapons, aren't very interesting. Though Thor's brother Loki (Hiddleston) sometimes brings comic relief to the film's dry, seriousness (I did enjoy one clever shape shifting moment) he still doesn't possess the physicality of Tom Hardy's Bane to be a truly menacing physical threat. Locked up in a cell for nearly half the film, there's not a lot for Loki to do. What should also be a haunting surprise at the end of the film is badly telegraphed. When Thor and Loki inevitably team up, the brothers take a few more punches than you might expect, but still recover very quickly, even after a severed hand. Marvel is a subsidiary company belonging to Disney so this is largely bloodless action. This is the first comic book feature film by Alan Taylor, who replaced Patty Jenkins under controversial circumstances. Taylor has worked on television shows like Game of Thrones, and he brings little distinction to the action and the way the story is told. The camera isn't particularly mobile and significant plot lines like the Aether are lazily signposted through the film's prologue. He opts to intercut Thor's main story with a subplot involving Jane's scientist friends back on Earth, including an overly excitable Kat Dennings, who are discovering the alignments of Asgard's nine realms, if that matters. Sometimes they lighten the mood but they're still cornball stereotypes (the wacky sidekick, the crazy scientist and the dorky intern) that don't instill any visible subtext to the plot. The two narrative threads collide with Taylor's most elaborate set piece, as Thor fights simultaneously between universes, a battle that is undone by Thor's own indestructibility. Over the closing credits are shots of the film's concept art, which could be totally interchangeable with most of the plotting. It's time that comic book fans started to demand more from these films before the entire genre evaporates into a disposable, commercialised heap like it does here.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My god this is a terrible movie....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am not sure where to begin....Maybe I was a bit lost because I never saw the first "Thor"...and I am not familiar with the character and what he is all about...But regardless...this movie was rambling and disjointed. All the characters were so superficial and one dimensional that I did not care in the least what happened to any of them. Apparently the entire universe was at risk, and this film managed to make that prospect completely boring and leave the viewer 100% indifferent about the outcome. Impressive.There were a few attempts at humor thrown into the movie. They were all childish...they failed...and in fact were so "unfunny" they made me cringe.About Thor. How interesting is a character who is apparently entirely omnipotent....? Near as I can tell, he can neither be hurt nor killed....and can travel the universe at more than the speed of light. Yawn. I have enjoyed Natalie Portman in many films...but even she could not contribute anything useful to this turd.Having said all this...as of this writing this movie has a 7.6 IMDb rating. I don't get it... I felt I had to post an honest review to counter that nonsense.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie is absolute garbage.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me start off by saying I had fairly high expectations for this film, not only being a fan of the first film but of Thor as a comic book characters. To be nice, these expectations were not met. To be realistic, this is easily the worst of the Marvel movies. This is my first review so sorry if I jump around a lot with what I say. Let's begin with the characters. Thor was.. okay. He said nor did anything noteworthy really. He didn't grow that much as a character, and simply felt boring. Natalie Portman was horribly boring to watch, and in some scenes her character was written as an idiot. That seems to be a common problem with the movie. Jane Foster? An idiot. Eric Selvig, an originally intelligent character that had some serious, good talks with Thor? Running around naked because the Tesseract made him go insane... or something. It wasn't very clear. Speaking of, if he went insane because of the Tesseract, why was Hawkeye completely okay after a bonk on the head? Darcy? The most annoying girl on the planet. She was meant for comedy but came of as GRATING to listen to and watch. Odin was a douche who didn't know how to rule properly. Malekith was just... boring. The makers had so much to work with, considering in the comics what a clever sorcerer he is, as well as a deranged homicidal madman. In this movie his motivations are unclear and his only character trait was he likes to frown at things with his puffy looking face. Character wise the only saving graces were Idris Elba as Heimdall and Tom Hiddleston as Loki, which did not matter much considering how little they were in the movie. Which is strange because Loki is in the trailer so much, but has MAYBE 20 minutes of screen time. The special effects in this movie were just ugly. Every monster looked fake and many of the scenes looked like they were pulled out of a last gen video game. the set design was okay, but not once did I feel immersed. Everything felt like a flimsy set. It was just an ugly movie to look at. The plot was just all over the place, with cuts to different scenes happening frequently. Many scenes were completely useless could have been cut altogether. Literally the only good scene was when Loki and Thor trick Malekith. Also, considering it was never explained how Loki was able to survive a stab wound, switch places with a guard, then switch places with Odin becoming the new leader of Asgard, the ending makes absolutely no sense whatsoever. The dialogue was just... horrendous. There were multiple points where myself and the people I've seen the movie with just laughed at the ridiculousness of what was being said. Speaking of, the movie was farrrrrr too funny. Don't get me wrong, I like comedic relief in these Marvel movies, it works for the established universe but GOD they literally play every scene for comedy it seems. Even the final world ending battle with Malekith was played for comedy. For Christ's sake, THOR RODE TO THE BATTLE IN A SUBWAY CAR. There's a gag where him and Malekith are sliding on the side of a building with office people looking outside blankly, completely meant for comedy.. IN THE FINAL, WORLD ENDING BATTLE. Avengers, Thor, Iron Man 1,2 Captain America, all these movies had the common sense to put the comedy in scenes where it was necessary. Hell, even Iron Man 3, the most comedic movie behind this one had the common sense to say "This is the final battle. Let's make this badass". Another problem with the final battle itself is that it has no 'WOW' moments. There's no real climax, everything is just bleh. OH and Malekith is squished by his spaceship. That's something. Oh and why the hell do Asgardians and Dark Elves have so many technological based things?! They have star ships, turrets, laser cannons, ray guns, etc. There's nothing here that feels like magic, which is what Thor should be about. And the Aether. The main point of the movie. The weapon to spread darkness throughout the universe essentially ushering an era of rule under Malekith. I couldn't tell you a damn thing about this thing other that it spread... darkness. whatever that means. The concepts that this movie is trying to give are incredibly under explained. Where did the Aether come from? Not explained. How did Jane end up actually finding it? Not sure. What's the Convergence? It's when the 9 realms line up so Malekith can... spread... darkness?.. How powerful is it? I have no idea. Apparently universe shattering, but Thor doesn't have much trouble fighting an Aether powered Malekith. It's actually kind of sad how easily he was dispatched. There is little fun to be had in this movie. It's just stupid. I didn't care about a single character besides Loki, who was actually somewhat developed and easily stole the show when he was on screen. This movie is absolute garbage and has ruined Thor cinematically for me. I truly hope Captain America: The Winter Soldier and Guardians of the Galaxy are good or I truly worry for the Avenegers 2. Please save your money. Don't see this movie. Don't tell the studios that this Transformers 2 level garbage is okay to put out, that these characters are okay to ruin. In the end, I give this movie a 2 out of 10, because Idris Elba was good, Loki was fantastic, and it had a single scene in the movie where it gave me a glimmer of hope that it would be redeemed. I'm sure I have far more to address but I'm trying really hard to forget this film and reread the latest Thor comic epic, Gorr the God Butcher. If you want to see some good Thor, read that rather than watching this. Please.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well they got the "dark" part right. Does it distress anyone at all that somewhere deep in the bowels of Hollywood there are people who make many times what you make for coming up with the idea that watching a lot of banging and clanging in an alternate universe that -- at its best -- resembles Central Park at midnight is .... entertainment? If it does not, it should. The problem with sequels like this -- aside from the fact that they are actually produced in the first place -- is that they serve no useful purpose other than making the original in the franchise look better than it was. I promise you, IN THE NAME OF ODIN AND ALL THE 9 WORLDS, that half way through this exercise in controlled depression, you will long for Thor 1. (With its really clever opening -- essentially the story of a Boy and his Hammer, having been separated therefrom, and finally reunited). Tom Hiddleston steals all his scenes, in some places he is more interesting huddled in a corner reading a book than all the CGI flashbangs and associated pyrotechnics combined. Sir Anthony -- a man seemingly untroubled by how poorly this phase of his career pales in comparison to his prior work -- is lost behind his eyepatch and almost unrecognizable. Portman has never had better H&amp;M (hair and makeup) and in the chatgroups there are fanboys prattling on about watching this with the sound off. A final factoid: In the 60s, in the days when Marvel was only comics, Thor was never top gun, it was the artwork (flaming yellow hair) and the pleasant predictability of the stories and the arcane language that carried the brand. So far, Marvel has yet to really translate this into film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Following on from the events of the Avengers movie, Thor is back in Asgard, delivering Loki, who is damned to spend an eternity in the Asgardian dungeons.Jane is in London, still pining for the titular character, as she hasn't seen him for two years, but still holding out for him.But there is a new threat from the dark elves. They seek an elixir type essence that will cause darkness amongst the nine realms.Jane however has found a portal into one of the realms, and gets infected by the essence. Because the dark elves can trace this source, Thor rescues her and takes her back to Asgard, much to Odins dismay.But the elves plan an attack on Asgard, and after many lives are lost, Thor realises that only one person can help him, and he's damned for the rest of his life....The first movie was wonderful. Not only was it exciting and refreshing, but it was one of the funniest Marvel movies released yet. This however takes a huge step back, and really taints phase two of the Marvel releases.Hemsworth is as good as ever, as is Hiddleston, but apart from Portman, it appears that the rest of the cast have been sidelined, so Thor and Loki can carry on their war of nerves.It's also very convoluted, narrative is lost as there is so much going on, and by the end of it all, you wondered what on earth went on, an also what happened to a few of the characters, there are plot holes aplenty.The humour what was wonderful in the first movie, feels really forced in this, and instead of causing unexpected laughter, had me rolling my eyes as to how silly it felt. Dennings is a thorn in the movies side, she is a parody of her character from the first, and ruins every scene she is in.The best joke in the film, which was in the trailer, steals from Raiders of the Lost Ark anyway.Visuals are bland and boring, and Asgard feels like something from The Phantom Menace, combined with Flash Gordon, and the rest of the realms could have come from any Lord Of The Rings movie.Its a shame, because Marvel know they have a winning formula, but here it feels like they are just in it for the money, and all the cool references and a brilliant cameo, cannot save such a disappointment.Many will call it Thor-some and other play on word praises.But for me, and I really hate saying this because Hemsworth is really good, it's pretty Thor-ful.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This film did not seem to do it for me.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I guess it may be the fact that I never actually got into comic books (beyond Asterix and Tintin that is) that this movie didn't really appeal to me. I guess in another way that I did not find that mixing the gods of the Norse pantheon with the world of superheroes really worked all that well. To me it just seemed to be wrong. Okay, I understand that Thor is the member of the Avengers, and the comic series that bears his name is quite popular, but to me parts of this film did not seem to work. In fact I found it quite boring.Okay, I did manage to spot Stan Lee, and I did like a couple of the twists at the end, but I am also glad that I missed the end-end sequence (as opposed to the end sequence) but then I have never been one who really wants to sit through a bunch of credits just to see the end scene. Some people suggest that we should sit through all the credits to acknowledge the contribution that the people made to the movie, however that may be, and they are entitled to that view, but my understanding is that if your name is in the credits it means a lot more than just me seeing it. I my name was in the credits to a movie I would rather potential employers see it because that is evidence that I have experience working on a film set.Also, the other thing that gripped me with this film was the numerous references to 'The Avengers'. Now, I have seen The Avengers, but it was over a year ago and I simply cannot remember much of what happened in that film. The references in Ironman 3 were okay because that assumed that you had seen the film but may not have remembered many of the details (I remember a giant centipede flying around New York City and Robert Downey Jnr) whereas this film seemed to assume a working knowledge and deep familiarity with The Avengers, something which simply did not work for me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good entry into the Marvel Universe</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having just watched a premier screening, I am delighted to come away from the cinema to write a positive review. Thor Dark World is a spectacular special effect driven film, much of which is set in Asguard.I was worried that including Loki yet again might become a little repetitive, but in this film he excels as a great character, I only hope however that they don't overdue his presence in the Marvel Universe. How many times can this guy come back from the dead?There isn't as much character development as the first film, and Thor's friends are nowhere near as interesting as the Avengers. I guess they simply needed these characters to all remain as they were so as to keep continuity within the Marvel universe, but its noticeable how little impact the storyline will have on anybody.The armies of Asguard were noticeably lacking in fire-power and weapons (even though they have an armoury), which is made even more evident when an entire guard division bring knives to a laser-gun fight. Their turrents were the only defense they had against an Ariel assault and proved to be practically useless. You would expect them to be better prepared.The healing powers of Thor, Jane, and even a smashed alien space-craft become a bit of a running joke as well. But at least they get hurt, even if it only takes them a scene to heal. And if smashing every column holding up a building is still not enough to take it down I'm not sure what will be. Christopher Eccleston played a competent bad guy, although his intentions for what he was doing was still unclear as to why. Its simple to say he was insane and just wanted to kill everybody, but when a threat of that magnitude appears and planetary alignments are in effect, you expect half the Universe to show up and stop him or take advantage of the situation, or come looking to take the power for themselves. I also expected to see the entire army of Asguard come to help out at the end like they apparently did in the past. Not just Thor who appears there by mistake.The scientist with the miraculous plot saving devise is also a little hard fetch to take in, especially when he creates a remote control for cosmic anomalies. Along with Loki's illusion power which also serves as a convenient plot-saving devise at times. I'm willing to overlook these but there's no denying what they are. Overall its a good enjoyable superhero movie, which you will want to watch several times and is a decent entry into the Marvel Universe.P.S. Watch it in 2D, The 3D added little of worth.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pure Enjoyment!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Occasionally in life there are those moments of unutterable fulfillment which cannot be completely explained by those symbols called words. This sequel is one such moment. I do need to see it again. In terms of pure enjoy-ability, I put it top 3 of all sequels that I have enjoyed.What I really liked...-Every single character gets a moment to shine and every single actor cast in these parts are perfect. -The comedy is perfect. It's such a fine balance overall and everything works because it's very subtle and fits in with certain circumstances. -Some very tender emotional scenes. I won't spoil anything with specifics. -Some superb action and what could very well be award winning special effects. -All characters interactions are great and handled very well. This is a fantasy story that really cares about character first and it shows all the way through. Even Natalie Portman's Jane feel more fleshed out than she did in the original film. -The set pieces and other realms talked about in the first are seen here and are beautiful and well done. Asgard was even better believe it or not. -The mid-credit and end credit scenes, both cool. Make sure you stay for both.Marvel hit a pure home run with this endeavor. This film works because of the great cast and the fact that they took this subject matter seriously but remember to have fun. Chris Hemsworth was again perfect. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What did I just watch?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Personally I am more of a DC fan than Marvel, but it seems like everyone has been pressuring me to watch the second installment of the Thor movies, and...it was disappointing.Thor 2 is directed by "game of thrones" director Alan Taylor who proved that he has a future in Hollywood, Alan Taylor is a great director, Thor 2 looked beautiful and the fight scenes were great. Sadly Alan Taylor's great directing could not overcome Thor 2's disappointing story, in my opinion it is too early to make a Thor film that takes place in Asgard, but it made sense because it seems that the Thor franchise can not survive without Loki. The film felt very messy as we learn about Malakith, a villain who barely appears in the film, the viewers just have no connections what so ever with the MAIN VILLAIN of the movie. Instead the writers focused on Loki who was amazing in this film, but the countless "is this guy Loki?" confusion was way too much, the viewer was unable to relate, first it was Loki against Thor (in the cell), then it was Loki with Thor (while going to the secret passage) then it was Loki against Thor, but we find out it was a trick...then Loki "dies" BUT we later find out he betrayed Thor...that was Way too much "Lokiception". In the film we see a slight tension between Sif and Jane Foster which I found to be completely unnecessary because except for the awkward looks they give each other, nothing really happens between them. The humor in Thor 2 is outstanding, but it gets repetitive at times. It felt like some points in this film were just not necessary at all! I understand that the writers wanted to make a point but the scenes were very briefly explained (the date in the beginning of the film). Although Chris Hemsworth did a good job as Thor, but it's starting to get old, I don't get the feeling i get when watching Robert Downey Jr as Iron Man or Hugh Jackman as the wolverine. But Tom Hiddleston is brilliant as ever. Overall, Thor: The dark world is an overrated film, where we see messy writing, mediocre acting (except for Tom Hiddleston) and unnecessary tension between the characters. Although Thor 2 had some flaws it is still worth watching Alan Taylor's outstanding directing in the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You should lower your expectations</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched the movie yesterday in the evening and honestly I did not enjoy it at all. Firstly we were shown 50 minutes ( yes 50 minutes!) of advertisement. I can proudly say I know all the kid's toys now.I was expecting much more better Thor movie however I was wrong. First half was "Narnia" and the second half was "London City Guide for Tourists" founded by some ministers probably. Odin was same , he always makes mistakes and Thor is always right. It was very weird to watch how they connect Jane Foster character and her fellow friends to the movie . Things happening all the time without any sense. Crazy weirdo scientists ( Hollywood likes to show weirdo crazy British scientist lately - Pasific Rim - Agents of Shield etc..), a very bad villain and thousands of Asgardian Guardians (Lets say headless chickens), very amateur Asgardian King( I do not even let him to drive my car, he is the king of stupidity.). I do not believe someone else could write this movie worse than them. 110 minutes of getting bored just to watch a complete disaster. By the way weirdos saved the universe with a game-boy and couple of sticks. We do not need any superhero anymore.If you are 12 okay you will enjoy I am sure. Stay away!!.And to Hollywood : Guys OK you can make special effects but please learn how to shoot a proper movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Thor: The Dark World" is just another cash grab for Marvel Studios. Its totally unoriginal, boring, bland, predictable, convoluted, and stupid. I don't understand why studios pour millions of dollars into CG effects that look so fake, when practical effects are much cheaper to achieve and cost effective, and actually have conviction and a sense of authenticity to them. Plus it takes forever for a movie to get released when you go for CGI because of the months it takes to polish up the effects work....At least the first couple Spiderman and XMEN movies felt like real films, this and Iron Man 3 were lifeless and robotic. I like the way Tim Robey of The Daily Telegraph put it... (Thor 2) feels entirely made by committee?the definition of house style, without a personal stamp in sight."........Why does the world and the whole universe have to be at stake in every movie nowadays? and the humor in this movie was very weak and lame, that hipster chick was so annoying too.....Its an entertaining enough product for most people I'm sure, Natalie Portman's easy on the eyes, and there are a few decent scenes, but overall its the same crap we've seen a million times before.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Poor writing and characters</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are a number of reasons why I found this film to be disappointing, unlike its predecessor which I enjoyed very much.1) Underdeveloped Bad Guy Syndrome: I know almost nothing about the bad guy even after watching the film. A dark elf who wants to blow everything up. Apparently that's all we need to know and all we'll ever know about the main villain in the film.2) Pointless Main Characters: The main characters in this film offer nothing of substance or value. For example, you could have replaced Jane with any other character without affecting the film. She exists solely as plot vehicle. The film does not explore her relationship with Thor, her reaction as a character to being transported to a different world, etc., etc. She's as thin as cardboard, like the rest of the main characters of this film.3) Very Poor Humor: Almost all of the jokes in this film made me roll my eyes and groan. It's as if the script writers liked the humor in Avengers and attempted to duplicate it without any knowledge of how.4) Ridiculous Plot Devices: Things in this movie only happen because the script says they have to. For example, Jane being the one possessed by the dark energy. Or the car keys being discovered on another planet. These things make no sense but exist solely because they have to for the plot to continue. I hate that.I had high hopes for Thor II but in the end it was just another disappointing let down.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well, that was a surprise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just got back from seeing this and thought I'd put in my thoughts.This is by far the most intricate and thoughtful of the Marvel films to date, with a great story and some superb performances, particularly Hiddleston's as Loki. The characters from previous Asgard related outings are there, but thanks to some good writing, are more 3 dimensional and therefore, interesting. This is one of the few films that would have benefited from an extra 15 minutes or so to explore further the motivations of the key protagonists. There is plenty of large scale action, as well as some laugh out loud humorous moments that help to keep this kicking along.I am both surprised and delighted that this is not only the best superhero movie to date, (even eclipsing Spider-Man 2), but currently the best movie I've seen this year.Don't miss this!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An unfocused mess</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first Thor was probably one of Marvel's more trickier movies since it centered heavily around Norse mythology. To make it work in the "real" world was a massive task. Integrating a billionaire playboy who doubles as a tech-powered superhero, or a scientist who turns into a green rage monster was easier to accomplish than the fantastic world of Asgard, Gods &amp; Monsters.Credit must go to Kenneth Brannagh who found the right balance between the fantastic and "real" (that's a stretch anyways) world. Furthermore, Brannagh focused on the characters instead of bombastic vfx (he still provided tons of beautiful shot visuals though).His replacement Alan Taylor however goes in the opposite direction and favors stylish visuals over character development. Worse still, the pacing and tone are all over the place.The Dark World tries to hard to provide the same brand of humor Joss Whedon is known for but fails to deliver the laughs, or they are rather misplaced.Bottom line: It's a too unfocused movie that suffers from a weak script and a director who tries too many things at the same time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Disney have produced some fantastic marvel films throughout there takeover. Ironman 1 and 3, Thor, and the avengers were awesome. They don't try to be the dark brooding DC films, they cant be, they're of a larger scope, more comprehensive in appeal. They're packed with humour, action, and riveting twists, and as a whole capture the characters spot on ie Downey jnr. This however, does not. This film is saturated beyond humour with joke after joke after joke. Thor has his lighter tales, but malekeith is a darker adversary, brooding and malicious. Thus the plot should reflect this. Yet this film kept joking and joking, so much, I didn't care about Malekeith, he didn't seem that menacing at all. He butchers millions...yet the humour detracted from that beyond belief. The twist in plot from Loki is its saving grace, as is Hiddlestone's acting, hopefully Thor 3 can recapture that which was Thor.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A sequel just for the sake of a sequel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a very unpolished sequel that seems to have gotten made, because they wanted a sequel and more money for the studio (probably more about the money). I liked this less than the previous first installment and I am not even a fan of the first one. It has more action and special effects, but that doesn't make a superhero movie any better. It just wasn't interesting nor did it have anything for me to attach myself to. After few minutes in, I just wanted for the final action set pieces to come in (which is actually cleverly done) and be done with. I know humor isn't suppose to be the part that stands out in a superhero movie, but my goodness, the humor in this is just forced and awful. Some of the characters seem more annoying than beneficial to this movie as a whole and just seemed to be there, because they were in the previous movie in this franchise. This movie brings nothing new to the superhero genre, they had the mentality of "if it works previously, why fix it?" direction. It's like one of those video games that does well with the first installment, but does the same thing with the gameplay and everything for the next installment with a different story with just another different villain that is generic as it gets.5.9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Once again, a sequel comes up short</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's nothing more disappointing than a sequel that does not live up to the original film it came from, therefore, my cinematic experiences over the years dealing with such efforts have certainly been tragic. Yes, there have been second films that have equaled or surpassed the original ("The Empire Strikes Back," "Superman 2," "The Godfather: Part 2," just to name a very few), but these are as rare as Academy Award nominations from "Weird Al" Yankovic.So, die-hard Marvel Studios fans may want to exit this website now and forgo any bitterness they may feel when they realize this review ? while not a whole dismissal of the newest superhero epic, "Thor: The Dark World" ? may not exactly be what they want to read at this moment.True to my nature as an optimist, however, I will highlight the positive points of the new production. First, Chris Hemsworth is the perfect choice to play the stoic, unemotional, dispassionate, apathetic, unmoved Nordic leading deity to a tee (actually, I'm not sure these are good points). It does not require a whole lot of animation to jump from the sky, punch someone out or throw a hammer. Hemsworth does a very good job in his portrayal of such a character and, as long as he does not try to break the acting ceiling like he did in "Snow White and the Huntsman," I think we'll be all right.The other good thing about this movie (and it's probably the best) is Loki (Tom Hiddleston, "Midnight in Paris"), the deeply troubled younger (and let's not forget ADOPTED) brother of the first prince of Asgard. It's his third appearance in the role and he has grown quite comfortable as the smirking, conniving schemer. Here, he makes every scene he's in delectable. It's too bad he is not in more. Plus, the sequences where he appears with Hemsworth are not only the best in the picture, but they elevate the latter's status and acting credentials even higher than they should be.Okay, we have discussed the positive, now let's look at the concerns. Replacing first installment director Kenneth Branagh (who was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Director ? and lead actor ? for 1989&#x2032;s "Henry V") eliminated the whole Shakespearian angle with the fallen brother, the troubled prince and world-weary king, which punctuated the action scenes and made for much more intelligent viewing than your average superhero narrative.Alan Taylor, while adept at television drama (several installments of "Mad Men," "Game of Thrones" and a host of others), has not helmed a feature film since "Kill the Poor" in 2003. His contribution to this feature ? at least as far as the Bard connection goes ? is negligible and thus much of the drama of "Thor" is replaced with the mediocre of standard fights, screaming and explosions. Yes, "Thor: The Dark World" looks good, but there is a troubling blandness and sameness to the enterprise.Sadly underused (or misused in some cases) are Anthony Hopkins ("Red 2") as King Odin, Natalie Portman ("Black Swan"), Stellan Skarsg?rd ("The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo") as Dr. Erik Selvig and Christopher Eccleston ("G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra") as the main villain ? that's right, Loki isn't even to top bad guy here ? Malekith. Hopkins is given even less screen time than in the first film, while Portman bitches and moans and nags so much about Thor being away one understands his reasoning completely. She is both bland and annoying, a difficult tightrope to walk (see "Mr. Magorium's Wonder Emporium" for a perfect example).Meanwhile, Skarsg?rd has been reduced to a comic relief buffoon and Eccleston, who began his career in 1991 in a great little British film, "Let Him Have It," is easily one of the worst Marvel villains of all-time, sort of a lightweight Bane, but without the menacing demeanor. Heavily made-up and CGIed to the point of complete obscurity, he comes back (after failing numerous time in the past) to use the all-powerful Aether to blow all of the realms to pieces, for whatever that's worth. The best spy, war and superhero movies have one thing in common ? great and terrifying bad guys (Goldfinger, Darth Vader, Lex Luthor, Loki). Malekith is certainly a name few will remember in the annals of filmdom's evil malefactors.Few will remember the plot of "Thor: The Dark World," as well. Basically Asgard is under assault from Malekith and Thor is forced to release Loki from prison (where he has been since the end of "The Avengers") to aid in the protection of the realms. The real drama is whether the kid brother can be trusted. Seems a logical concern to me. There are trips to other planets and Earth gets a few location shots. Monsters are destroyed, good guys are pounded and, for a while, we wonder if anyone can survive the onslaught of out-of-control special effects. One funny sequence involves Thor and Malekith bouncing around the universe while the mighty hammer of the Norse god struggles vainly just to keep up with the action."Thor: The Dark World" is nowhere near enough to surpass the first experience, and while not a bad movie at all, it just seems like a temporary diversion until a part three (or "The Avengers: Age of Ultron") comes out. Sadly, that's just not enough for a studio with a much better track record than this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first THOR was a hard sell? A demigod with long blond hair and an ancient hammer isn't your typical brooding comic book hero? And so the earthlings, including Natalie Portman's Jane, a beautifully brainy love interest and her colleagues, including sarcastic hipster chick Darcy, who, using a snarky monotone, second-guesses the bizarre situation, helped make the audience believe this was all really happening?But after THE AVENGERS, we don't need further confirmation. Thor, played by Chris Hemsworth, is very real and his home-world Asgard is in danger because of a monolithic structure Jane discovers between worlds? Part of which enters her body? And when she quickly travels with Thor to Asgard, the stranger in a strange land concept doesn't quite work like when Thor came to earth?Although a worthy actress, Portman's tone/voice sounds more like a valley girl in a local arcade. Meanwhile, back on earth, as the scientists gather to figure things out, Darcy's forced comic relief is annoying, distracting, and downright unfunny?Thankfully there's Thor's "brother", that instigative menace from THE AVENGERS who, locked into a permanent glass structure, is freed to help destroy the big bad (and completely uninteresting) villain? Thankfully, the dependable Loki, like Gene Hackman's Lex Luthor in SUPERMAN 2? after being replaced as the central villain? keeps the dry humor flowing ? some lines hit, other miss, but that's the best thing DARK WORLD has going for it: the camaraderie between two polar opposite brothers in a colorful world where dazzling special effects have an old school matte painting aesthetic, while space ships zoom around like in the STAR WARS (or current STAR TREK) universe?It's when Thor joins the small band of earthlings to thwart the city-ravaging beast, while strategically jumping from various wormholes into either dimension, that things gets convoluted, ponderous, and with a second AVENGERS already planned, somewhat pointless too?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Most disappointing sequel you'll ever pay to see!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Thor: The Dark World was truly a dark disaster. Although many critics disliked Thor for lack of plot, the Thor sequel fell entirely short of its predecessor.The first scene opens up with a red, demon-like, liquid spirit and evil force that will eventually inhabit Natalie Portman's character and Thor's love interest, Jane Foster. The creepy, flimsy aliens that have possession of it are not only weird, but let's face it, just down right ugly. In addition, fans of the first Thor expected for the chemistry between Thor and Jane to develop, something that never quite happens. Yes, Jane and Thor kiss and yes, Jane fondles over Thor as he passes out while saving the world. But the two just "happen" to meet again, giving no real connection to the audience. Thor just happens to "fall in love" somewhere in the first movie, a scene that had to be deleted from the big screen.The biggest fault, be it mine or the producers, was the continuation of the film from the events of the Avengers. Because I didn't see the movie, many scenes I simply did not understand. Had I known, I would've seen the Avengers prior. But I thought I was going to see a Thor sequel and not an Avengers knock-off? Overall, it was even more disappointing than I could have imagined. Better luck next time, Marvel!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>First Was Okay, This One Was Meh</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film was just okay. Maybe my expectations were too high for Thor 2. I was really hoping it would improve on the first one (which was good but had so much more potential.) I saw some good reviews for this one and some bad ones, so I tried not to have my expectations up TOO high whenever I saw it on my own. Don't get me wrong--it was an enjoyable movie. It had its funny moments, many of them involving Tom Hiddleston. There was also more time spent on Asgard, and Jane finally got some more screen time. But overall, the film was average. Perhaps I was expecting more from it, but it fell down from my expectations (only slightly, as I did not love the first film but thought it was just decent). I really, really wanted to love it, but I didn't. So I guess I was disappointed in it.SPOILER ALERTThe plot of the story was mediocre. We're given a back story about the main antagonist, Malekith, and a little about Asgard and his connection to it, but it's a little incoherent. Which isn't totally bad, I guess, but Malekith's reasons for wanting to destroy Asgard just seem flat to me. He feels like your atypical I-Wanna-Destroy-Your-World type of villain, which has been done many times before.The way they make Jane get possessed by the evil source or whatever that Malekith needs felt like a forced way to have her in Asgard. She spends a lot of time passing out or cowering behind as battles wage on. It gets a little better near the end, where Jane helps Thor defeat Malekith, but overall she isn't given much to do. I don't expect her to be superman or whatever, given that she has no powers, but I wished she had been given more to do as opposed to being the victim of an evil entity. She also doesn't have enough chemistry with Thor to make me feel like they really love each other.Darcy was funny in the first film, and still was to an extent in this one, but there was times when she was annoying. She got too much screen time, and I believe that a comic relief needs less so that they remain funny and not get annoying. Her sidekick, or intern, also feels useless and is used to temporally replace Eric Selvig, who, thanks to Loki, has gone insane and does crazy antics for comic relief.As I mentioned earlier, Loki was fabulous in this film, having very funny one-lines and making smart remarks. However, his motives get a little messy in this film. It makes since that he would be a sort of shades of gray character, but when (and there's a HUGE spoiler coming up here) he is supposedly killed to sacrifice himself for Thor and then appears to be alive and wanting the throne is Asgard as Thor leaves to Earth, I'm left confused. What was the point of Loki "sacrificing" himself if he wanted the throne? Was he pretending to die so that no one would suspect he'd become king? Maybe that's just apart of the mystery of his plot, and I'll have to watch the next film to see. But, as a stand-alone, it's confusing.Odin is reduced to being a jerk for the sake of the plot. He shows little to no concern for Jane when Thor brings her to Asgard until he discovers what she is possessed with. He also basically tells Thor that the only difference between him and Malekith is that he "will win" the battle. This seems a little out of character from the Odin we met in the first film, who wanted to be a fair and strong ruler. I know why they did it-- to give Thor a reason to want to stay on Earth--but by making Odin do something that seems so rude kind of turns the audience off from his behavior.Once again, Thor's friends (Sif, Fandral, Volstagg, and Hogun) receive little screen time or anything character development in general. Fandral, Volstagg, and Hogun say little to no words in this film; a possible love triangle between Sif, Thor, and Jane is implied and then quickly gotten rid of. These characters are fun, and I really wish I got to see more of them.Some of the comic relief felt odd. For instance, Selvig is glad when Thor tells him that Loki dies but quickly offers Thor some very awkward condolences. I completely understand why he would want Loki dead--this IS the man that possessed/made Selvig go crazy, after all-but the audience is led to believe that Loki really has died. Maybe they expected us to know that he hadn't? I know that I didn't believe his death, so maybe that's why. But there were other places where the comic relief felt odd, too, mostly exchanges taking place during the battle scenes. At least they were funny.And finally, the film feels entirely too short. I get that they might not want to make it longer for budget reasons, but if that's the case then they shouldn't try and throw in character development. Some things just felt rushed, and some characters feel underdeveloped. Admittedly the length is not as bad as it was in the first film, but this is mostly because we've already gotten to know the characters and they are now being expanded on.SPOILER ENDSo that's pretty much how I feel about Thor: The Dark World. I guess it sounds like I disliked it more than I liked it, and maybe I do, but it wasn't a bad film. I'd watch it again if someone asked me to, and I'd laugh at the comical parts and still enjoy the movie. It's just one of those instances where a film is okay, or even good, but could have been better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I like the first Thor but honestly this one was so boring and predictable that I left the movie theatre tired and incredibly bored. It starts off with a huge battle and that is great. I like battles but it is between the Asgard and the Dark Elves. The dark elves get beaten and thought of as dead. And for some reason Asgard, protector of the nine realms does not really confirm this, they just assume. So an entire millennium passes. Then Natalie Portman is in London. Just like that, for some reason she is in England and then for some reason, just like that in a warehouse is an inter dimensional gate to a dark cave that holds some crazy slimy looking evil ghost like thing, that naturally possesses her sort of. She is still herself but if some touch her they are thrown across the room, while if others touch her they are fine.Well after an hour of this, then finally the Dark Elves attack Asgard, attack London and take the evil from Natalie Portman who survives naturally. Thor does a bunch of punching and tough stares. Loki lies a bunch of times and naturally there is a big alien battle in London and of course Thor saves the day with the help of Natalie Portman and her earthly friends.I honestly found this movie so boring and recycled that I found myself actually wanting to fall a sleep in the theatre. I had such high hopes for this movie because I thought the first one (see my review for it) was pretty good. This one I am not interested in ever seeing again. It is predictable, long and boring.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went into this movie very excited. I love marvel movies. In fact, The Avengers was one of the best movies of the last couple of years. While I thought the first Thor movie was the worst of the first wave of Marvel movies, I went into this one with high hopes. But within the first five minutes of the movie I was bored out of my mind. Throughout the entire movie NOTHING happens. They spend the entire movie talking about doing something, or talking about things they did off screen. Even the action scenes were incredibly boring. they just bounced around from punch to punch. Nothing really ever gets resolved. Then there's the writing. The characters are very one dimensional. There dialog was very unrealistic. I mean, no one talks like they do in this movie. And there is absolutely no character development, the characters end the movie exactly where they started! Then there's the villain. I love Eccleston. But they didn't give him anything to do. He simply walks on screen, looks at something, then walks off. He's BORING! Just like everything else in this movie. All this movie is capable of is beating you over the head with all of the pretty lights. And while the movie is gorgeous. That doesn't cover the lack of story. In the end, this movie was terrible. It was one of the worst excuses for a movie I have ever seen.</fullReview>

Question circulating in my head was what kind of people did give this rating different than 1. It is a disaster I cannot even explain, horrific play and scenario, won't even talk about the interpretation of the Scandic mythology as whoever has seen the first one knows its done by people with no sense of it at all. Indeed, this thing is a serious offense against the culture of the Scandinavians.In a few words, it reminds me of a cheap Hercules style series, looks like the budget has been $14, 189.67 in total, is made by people with no sense of mythology and is totally disastrous. Worst 8 euro I have ever spent in my life, worst by far. Movie deserves a parody. Cries for one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you like fantastical characters and fantastical worlds that make as much sense as going to the local crack house for vitamins, then this film is for you. Its a cruel world were you spend your hard earned cash on such an over all bad film experience. Sorry I could not find anything constructive to say about this film. I struggled all the way through until finally (three quarters through) I give up and left the cinema.As this is my very first review I even ran out of words to fulfill the unnecessary 10 lines of containment text to leave a comment. :(</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What???</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't know how some of the reviews here are so positive! Bad. bad movie. All the happenings seem so constructed, that I couldn't stop thinking why the figures in the movie act so stupidly. Very bad writing. The scenery can be good from time to time. But the events in the movie just seem like none of the characters could make A SINGLE logic and useful decision. 2 stars because it had some good pictures in it. Otherwise more than horrible movie that made me think "What? Oh, come on!" about a hundred times. it almost seems like a spoof of a good vs. bad plot. And on the way we have a bunch of bad jokes to mess up this movie even more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Did not live up to expectations</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We had a midnight viewing last night (Wednesday 30th Oct midnight)and for some reason there were less than 20 patrons, so that was the first warning sign. Then there was 30 minutes of adverts and promotions - okay maybe I exaggerate just a tad, but I was just so excited to see a movie I've waited so long to see, every second of delay was torture.When the movie started the real torture started. Probably I'm getting too old and I've seen all this shat before, I just expected something different for a change. If your mentality is below 12 you might like it, otherwise it is old hat with unimaginative villains that were even too far fetched for a cartoon.By the time Thor was half-way through I was bored and couldn't give a flying sardine who did or didn't get killed. The directors (I don't even want to know) obviously couldn't take the scrip seriously (and who could blame them) and it showed with idiotic out of place comedy. I believe this was done just to distract the long suffering viewer, except it did remind me of a dumbed down version of Dr Who - if that is possible! The bottom line here is credibility, no one in this work of fart could act there with a straight face. There was never a doubt the Universe was going be saved - I'm not kidding - it is this stupid!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Terrible movie. As bad as the first entry and this is hopefully the last. Convoluted, blurred, and without meaning, this was a mess from start to finish. I give it 4 stars for some humor, and the fact that I own several 60's Thor comic books and hope the attention increases the worth of my collection. BAD! I fell asleep early on, went to get popcorn and soda to wake up; after another 30 min found myself dozing again. This is amazing considering it was cold and very loud in the theater. Forgive me, I like story development, and characters to root for, or root against. There is nothing worthy here. This was made because the previous entry made money, so why not chase the cheddar shall we?! Hollywood and their overuse of CGI is increasingly bad and overdone. The characters hop around, as they do in Man of Steel another bad flick. They move really fast and do things we could never imagine characters doing 30 years ago on screen. Well so what?! It looks sooo fake and the result is an unimportant, needless and ridiculously boring movie. AVOID! ps, get a look at the elves as they run in their costumes (big laughs), they actually look like they are in costume! Enough already!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I studied the convergence for 25 minutes. This movie gets high ratings for the same reason that The Hobbit does: people love to see great effects that are neato, and rumbling sounds. One more sign of crumbling intelligence in a crumbling society. Most of the great movies have no special effects whatsoever. Few of them come from modern day Hollywood. Save your time and pick your nose in the bathroom at home. Crap, I don't have enough lines. I can't figure out how to write a long review about something as vapid as this movie. If you liked "Android Cop, "I, Frankenstein" or "After Earth," then you will love this one. I took my son to this and 25 minutes in I told him I would buy him a toy at Walmart if we could leave. The total price for the evening was $15 for the movie + $45 for the LEGO set = $60. However, he got a new toy and I didn't have to watch that crap movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Walking out of Thor: The Dark World I felt I just watched Transformers: Dark of the Moon again. It has the spit out formula that blockbuster movies like Iron Man 2 have. It feels like TV has another spin off cop show. The CGI is big-budget, but the story here has hardly any suspense and is boring. The movie reuses the short action, talking, villain creates problem, talking, and conclusion plot line. The movie starts with a small-scale fight with irrelevant enemies to introduce Thor. Then Jane messes with a portal while an ancient vengeful antagonist who lost long ago shows up, all the way to the mid-point when Marvel recreates the Star Wars The Phantom Menace battle with the energy shield dome and two armies run at each other, and it ends shortly, to restart in the ending. Thor has no weaknesses and he needs Loki for distraction. Describing the ending in one sentence sounds like the premise of The Avengers ending. Save your money for the next Marvel movie. I wrote this review this morning and six hours have passed and I have forgotten most of the movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have seen Thor 1 and I thought that it was a nice introduction to something good they will come up with in future. I didn't like the character of Thor, the way it was portrayed later in the avengers and was disappointed with it. Then comes Thor: The dark world and i have been reading pretty descent comments about it everywhere and decided to give it one last chance and boy i was wrong. This movie has thoroughly and utterly disappointed me, there wasn't a single WOW moment in this movie, special effects had nothing special in them, story: over complicated along with astro physicists and their weird instruments and what not. It was humorous at time but seldom the timing was appropriate. My verdict: I will personally not suggest my friends to watch this movie or any future Thor movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just Wonderful! Packed with action, heartfelt emotion, humor, drama and intensity.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Thor The Dark World is brilliant and completely tops the first film. There are a lot of extremely funny bits in it as well as some dark and moving moments. Probably a much funnier movie than it had any right to be given the subject matter. Loki is done perfectly and the dialogue between him and Thor is superb.If you're a fan of the first, this certainly won't disappoint at all. Without spoiling anything, the scale of this film is very Avengers-like in that the action pieces are amazing. During a sequence halfway through, I literally turned to my friend and said, "this is freakin' awesome".Needless to say, I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. Each frame is packed with action, heartfelt emotion, humor, drama or intensity. I was expecting to simply see crazy mythology with monsters destroying the landscape of the nine realms for two hours. Instead, I was shocked at the depth and complexity of this film. You definitely need your brain and your heart turned on for this one, unlike other CGI mishmashes. If you want a movie with just dumb action and no plot then stay away from this exceptional film. The performances are top tier and the visual effects may be the best I've seen this year. I have to join the majority of people and even critics that are praising this film. It's a true joy and such a pleasant experience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When the character I was looking forward to seeing the least becomes the best of the bunch, I'm pleasantly surprised. And the second Loki was on the screen, I fell in love with him all over again.Thor: The Dark World also jumped leaps and bounds over its predecessor in regards to CGI and overall look. I actually laughed and shook my head a lot ? at the original for its terrible CGI. During this one, I barely noticed a thing wrong with the presentation on screen and that's a good thing, since the first film's disastrous graphics were an incredible distraction.But, getting back to Loki, or who I like to refer to as: Loki Luthor, since he's in every Thor-appearance movie to date, and Lex Luthor was in 4 of 6 (if you don't count "Lex Corp" in the background of Man of Steel.) It was just overkill and lacked originality. Even though, he was one of the few bright spots here, in this Thor sequel, I might change my mind if he's, once again, in a third Thor movie, or heavens, The Avengers: Age of Ultron.Thor's sorta cleaning up the mess left by his brother in chains, Loki, when the incredibly long intro back-story kicks in, i.e. Thor's long-distance girlfriend, Jane, gets attacked by a "Spawn from Hell." Then, he sorta has to clean up that mess with the help from, yep, Loki and the Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.'s Leo and Jemma. Oh, wait, make that some characters from the original Thor and one failed comic relief dude.The story's a mess, barely coherent at times and hardly original, pacing and length had me squirming at times, the dialogue's barely acceptable ? and the subtitles did nothing to cover up the bad script, the editing's way off and Chris Hemsworth all-but phoned in this Thor. But, dang, that all said, I had a much better time here than the first movie which was way more a mess. Here, in part two, while Anthony Hopkins, Renee Russ and even Natalie Portman did what they could and were entertaining, it was really Hiddleston's Loki that stole every scene and you could sense he was both the glue to the film and the most enthusiastic person to be in this movie.For the some parts, it was a fun and funny ride ? I did laugh out loud a few times, only not at the movie, this time around, and it's entertaining for probably one viewing. Noting huge, but definitely a make-up for part one.* * * Final thoughts: I was told there were two "extra, Marvel-sig" endings during/following the end credits. Come on guys; the movie was long enough as it was and after the second of three endings, pending you're counting the real ending, was actually pretty lousy and not worth the 2 minute wait for that one. I did leave at that point since I knew there was a minimum of 10 more credit minutes. Lucky I did take off; I found out later that thee final ending was actually worse than the first two. Bah!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For starters, I loved this film! I was a fan of the first but this one is superior in every way. The actions scenes are better, the plot is better and there is great banter throughout the film. Due to these factors it is entertaining and has more than enough in it to keep you interested. The acting is fantastic, especial by Chris Hemsworth and Tom Hiddleston, as they work great together and appear to have a great understanding of each others roles. I just can't understand why people don't like this film unless they are not a fan of superheroes. After seeing this film last night I read through a few of the reviews afterwards and was shocked as some people were giving it lower than 7. These people are clearly boring and have no idea about an entertaining film and enjoy watching films that just depress you and have no idea about what a fantastic superhero film this is. I recommend you watch this immediately as you won't be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Marvel has out done themselves again. Great Film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Infinitely better than the first (which I liked) because of better action, humor and emotion. All those people who were worried about Thor being underpowered are going to be pleased. The effects are wonderful and it is indeed a very funny and a very moving movie in places. I'm happy to report that neither factor is overused or gets in the way of the feel or story. It's the right amount of humor and right amount of angst. Cinematography is great and the score is amazing. Whoever scored this film should do so for the rest of the Marvel movies in my opinion.I knew they would nail the pathos but was pleasantly surprised by the creative fight sequences. They are phenomenal. Not overly long but when they rage, THEY RAGE. Also, Kurse can rival the Hulk in terms of scary power. He was better utilized than the Destroyer was in the first film. Loki is the scene stealer that was all hoped to see! Jane and Sif add more than eye candy but you would expect no less from Marvel. Hemsworth has cemented his legend as Thor with this effort. My only real disappointed is a minor one. They didn't really show the nine realms in any real detail. It seemed a cop out that hey're just open landscapes. Yet, maybe they didn't want to commit to anything for future movies.Overall, this is a wonderful movie and maybe Marvel's best solo film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unfavorable Thor 2 Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie's only saving grace was every scene with Loki, who sadly isn't going to be in Avengers 2 according to Joss Whedon. This film spent way too much time with Natalie Portman and her throw-away friend characters trying to dish out quirky comedic relief, which resulted in painfully unfunny scenes that dragged and dragged and dragged... I'm not sure what it is about Natalie Portman's acting but for me it was excruciatingly reminiscent of her Queen Amidala performance. Her acting tends to be pretty hit or miss for me but these Thor movies just haven't been doing her any favors. The relationship she has with Thor is so unconvincing and bland that the movie can't even be bothered to tack on a little farewell scene for the both of them when Chris Hemsworth goes back to Asgard at the end. It cares that little. Also, generic evil bad guy is more undefined than any other super villain the Marvel movie universe has come up with so far. Why is it so difficult to write a memorable antagonist in these movies?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Aether, the Dark Elves and Loki</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Odin (Anthony Hopkins) recalls when his father Bor and the warriors from Asgard vanquished the evil Dark Elves and their leader Malekith (Christopher Eccleston) that wanted to send the universe into the darkness during the convergence of nine realms unleashing the powerful weapon Aether. Mallekith escapes and Bor hides the Aether in-between two stone columns.In the present days, on Earth, the scientist Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) that is waiting for the return of Thor, investigates a gravity phenomenon in an abandoned factory with her assistant and her intern. She finds the column where the Aether is hidden and the substance possesses her. In Asgard, Heimdall (Idris Elba) reports to Thor (Chris Hemsworth) that Jane has disappeared. Thor returns to Earth and finds Jane; but when he sees that he has a strange energy protecting her, he brings Jane to Asgard to be healed. However, Malekith also awakes and goes to Asgard to retrieve the Aether. After a bloody battle, Frigga (Rene Russo) is murdered by Malekith and Thor proposes treason to his warriors friends of Asgard and teams up with Loki (Tom Hiddleston) to seek revenge for the murder of their mother and to vanquish Malekith before he destroys Asgard with his Dark Elves. "Thor: The Dark World" is another great adventure of Thor. In this movie, Thor makes the most unlike association with Loki and the result is a wonderful movie. The scene of Loki fighting with Thor is the best moment of "Thor: The Dark World". Chris Hemsworth perfectly impersonates Thor and the conclusion surprises. Last but not the least, the movie is to be watched until the very end of the credits because there are two additional scenes in the credits. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): "Thor: O Mundo Sombrio" ("Thor: The Dark World")</fullReview>

The girl that was suppose to be Portmans assistance was utterly pointless and annoying. To top this there was an assistant to her, this man was even dumber than her. I think it has become an sport to make male characters with no spine and brain in Hollywood movies, it makes the feminist happy. Back to the movie, 30 minutes through we were literally falling sleep, so looked at each other and just left. There is no plot that can have anything remotely to do with any possible laws of physics, anything goes. No characters to relate to, and special effects well, there are explosions that is all.

		<fullReview>Thor: the dark world drags you in to complete darkness, you will find not a single reason why the makers have made this film, no matter how much you juggle your Head. The story starts with history lessons about Thor's grandfather. You will never see him again for a single second in the whole movie. And the point was to create an enemy who is enormously strong but hiding out for centuries, another senseless thing. Well Loki is in prison and became a "Family Guy"!! Is it possible ? Natalie Portman is in danger and she is not safe even in Asgard. Thor's entire contribution was to save the girlfriend and leave the people on their own. Things are happening on earth too, Erik Selvig runs without cloths not wears his pants, I don't know what was the reason behind that. Chis Hemsworth has done a terrible job, Tom Hiddelston over shadowed everyone else through his spectacular performance. Idris Elba and Anthony Hopkins are as good as they are. Action sequences has nothing new and quite boring at some places. Vfx and special effects are too heavy for this plot. Background sound is terrible and film's biggest drawback.You can watch Thor 2 only under one condition, You are a die hard fan of LOKI. All my 2 stars are for Tom Hiddelston.</fullReview>

Basically, I saw the first Thor film when it came out and it didn't exactly blow my mind, so I wasn't expecting much from this film. My gut feelings proved to be justified. I cannot believe all of the praise this film has received and even most of the critics go on about how great it is, which proves how little they know. This film is a two-hour special effects show, with no plot and actors that are too unbelievably good-looking to be true. I would imagine that this film would only appeal to comic-book nerds or 10-year old boys and anyone else would be bored stiff after the first hour. I am angry that this crap ever got the green light from Hollywood and angry at myself for wasting my time and money to watch it. I have seen better DTV films than this, which were made with worse actors and a much lower budget. Avoid this crap like your life depended on it and, if you really must see it, wait until it turns up on TV. At least then you won't have wasted any money to see it. Simply awful.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Far exceeding Thor (1), The Dark World is brilliantly shot, well-acted and leaves the viewer wishing for more. In truth it could've been 20min longer but I liked it. People love to complain about this movie *SPOILER* (DO NOT READ IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THIS FILM) The reason Thor and many others shift through one realm into the next is due to a Once in 5,000 Years event called The Convergence, where all Nine Realms line up, causing energy and matter to be able to pass realm to realm as though through a door. Some people can't grasp this and therefore, due to their sloping foreheads, will never grasp this concept. When asked, "what is your favorite Marvel Film Franchise (?), a noted physicist said Thor 1 &amp; 2, because of how true these events actually are being considered in the real world. (Wormholes, etc.) But back to the film. This is great. Im seeing people say They hate this but loved Avengers, or vice versa. This is ludicrous. Say you don't like Thor, fine. I have no issue with personal taste. All I'll say to sum up my feelings are, working at a comic shop, reading Thor all my life, this is a great story with great banter and action. Even my die-hard DC friends love this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Technically superb Thor sequel that is missing a heart...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>1st watched 12/4/2013 ? 5 out of 10(Dir-Alan Taylor): Technically superb Thor sequel that is missing a heart or a reason to care. Visually this movie has a lot to offer, but about halfway thru a realization comes that the fluff isn't enough to sustain a seasoned movie-goer. I had a similar reaction to the Harrison Ford epic "Blade Runner" and other movies that have a lot of style, but very little heart. The story revolves around a matter hidden deep beneath the Earth called "Ether" that can change compositions quickly and is sought after by an evil elf-like creature from a world before there was light, Aka. The Dark World. He believes this Ether has the power to bring back his world. Natalie Portman, plays Jane Foster, a companion of Thor and a scientist ? who comes upon this substance during an investigation and it possesses her. The evil creature is then after her and Thor(played by Chris Hemsworth), and he, of course, wants to protect her. The settings in the movie consist of Asgard ? ruled by Thor's father Odin(played by Anthony Hopkins), London, and the dark elves' world?.the movie jumps back and forth between these worlds partially because of a weird warp found during the investigation that transfers items across these worlds?but Thor seems to be able to go in and out no matter what. There is plenty of action to be had, decent acting, and a little humor but other than the expected battle between good vs. evil there is no real reason or emotion to stay with the movie to the very end. The movie should probably win some visual effects awards, but I'm looking for a complete experience and in my opinion ? this isn't one. It is a good try but not quite good enough for my approval.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Underwhelming, soulless.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A weak entry into the Marvel lineup, this film has most of the right ingredients but lacks something vital.I left the cinema disappointed - but without any great glaring crime to judge the film for.The action sequences are filler, lacking exciting or creative choreography in favour of formulaic exchanges of gain and loss, the mechanics of drama laid bare. The plot is epic, but no-one seems to have any real grasp of what 'the end of the universe' would really mean. The villain is an excellent actor not given anything to work with - a character without a personality, without either strength or weakness, without any motivation except that issued bluntly in the prologue. He hasn't a single meaningful line. He has none of the layered darkness and intrigue of Iron Man 2's villain, or Thor's own Loki.Loki excels in his tightly defined role, but as a side-story he only scores so much screen time. Thor remains well-played but has acclimatised to Earth standard remarkably quickly across his two brief holidays there, lacking any of his brusque viking charm or culture clash from the original.Heimdall is a weak depiction this time around - very much the same character, but with none of the barely-contained, frightening power of his first outing.Asgardians and Svartalfar alike are faceless, masked or helmeted mooks, serving only to die in battles with all the energy and realism of a children's play directed by a nine-year-old Michael Bay.All in all, the film is simply... Dull Hollywood entertainment without any threat, drama, darkness, or intrigue, and all too much comic relief that costs the atmosphere rather than being part of it. The closest it gets to interesting is in its reality-bending gravitational anomalies between worlds, which remind one more of the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. franchise or the classic novel Roadside Picnic than anything else.Odin has been tragically rewritten into an angry, elitist grump even before the plot gives him a reasonable excuse.I'd say avoid this one, much like The Incredible Hulk, and perhaps Captain America. The three weakest entries in the Marvel movie lineup, barring the disputed Spider Man set.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thor? More like Bore</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Marvel factory rolls on, and the next widget down the assembly line is 'Thor: The Dark World'. Devoid of much of the wit, heart and character development that made the first 'Thor' a surprisingly solid stand-alone film, 'The Dark World' tries to skate along on its breathtaking visuals and the good will created by 'The Avengers'. It doesn't succeed. From its info-dump opening to its dull, drawn out finale, I never gave two Sifs about anything or anyone in this film.After this past Summer's dreadfully dull and lifeless 'Iron Man 3', Marvel's post-'Avengers' slate is now a big 0-2. Sadly, they can't hear my complaints over the sound of ringing cash registers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When we left our friends in Asgard, all was right in the 9 realms after Loki was thrown into an abyss for his selfish ways and almost destroyed everything the Asgardians hold most dear. But it has been 2 years since Jane Foster and Thor parted ways and now they are reunited because of a darkness that shrouds over Jane's inner body as she infects a most powerful and deadly weapon that could not only destroy her but the entire 9 realms ? it takes a vicious monster Malekith (played wonderfully by Christopher Eccleston) to destroy all of the races in the universe to converge it all in darkness.But it takes Thor (Hemsworth) along with Foster (Portman) and Loki (Hiddleston) to save the day. But what we don't know may surprise us ? that the Tesseract, the Aether, so close together creates something more deadly than what they could ever even think that could happen to the fate of the entire universe.This movie was excellent and I am looking forward to seeing what is next for our mighty god of thunder.</fullReview>

With a fantastic contrast of scenes and emotions this film kept me entertained and hooked until the very end. It made me laugh, made me scared and made me cry (especially the scenes surrounding Loki). Kat Dennings and Stellan Skarsgard made some hilarious jokes and made me and all of my family laugh. Chris Hemsworth and Natalie Portman conveyed the relationship excellently, Christopher Eccleston was captivating and Tom Hiddleston made me smile and cry, what more can I say( he is an amazing actor and my idol).The plot twist at the end was fantastic and totally unexpected, the whole plot was well planned and written. I cannot wait for the next installment of this franchise! Fantastic writing and acting!!!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Maybe a "3" is too high a grade for this film, but I guess the special effects has to be weighed in, although they are completely wasted since the overall content is totally crap. Firstly we have Thor: A completely uninteresting character played by someone without any skills whatsoever. Secondly it is a world with space ships, where all soldiers has clubs, axes and swords. Duh? Thirdly? well, the story is completely uninteresting and hard to follow. Probably because they try and pack a lot of viking stuff into some kind of modern package and while doing this they have not only lost the audience but themselves as well.I dunno.</fullReview>

I forgot the characters and the story, I only remember that there was some kind of battle with some ancient enemy. Just like in Thor: TDW. We also have some ancient ?powerful" enemy which has been defeated aeons ago, when he tried to take over control of the universe, or something like that. Now this enemy is back along with some kind of super-weapon. And our heroes evil brother Loki is also present and continues with his schemes and tricks. Our hero is - as before - invincible and in the end we have big battle on Earth and on the plant of Who-cares-heim. The powerful (read boring and forgettable) enemy is defeated and in the end of the movie we some some hints for things to come in planned sequels. Nothing new. But, I must confess that Thor is a likable hero so there are some laughs in this installment. See it if you must.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thor the Bor</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Though I'm a devoted fan of SciFi, video games, fantasy and anime, I've always felt like an undernourished geek because I missed the superhero/comic book fan gene?especially when the genre can produce something as seductive as "The Dark Knight." Watching "Thor: The Dark World 3D," however, has cured me of any residual shame in my belief that comic book stories are more cartoonish than cartoons. This movie is just a comic book with lots of frames, and not a good one at that: poorly directed, badly written: "I believe fate has brought us together." Argh! 'Kiss' had more subtle makeup. The storyline disintegrates like English cow patties under a cave golem: before there was even light in the universe there were the Dark Elves. Despite this implausibility, is that why they're called Dark Elves? With the war (over what again?) lost, along with their "aether" (OK?the aether graphics are cool), being some cosmic evil essence, I think, supposedly to be hidden so thoroughly that no one would ever find it?"ever" lasting only until Natalie Portman accidentally falls through a rabbit hole to trip over this most unfindable object on a pedestal under a spotlight. Acting OK but even Natalie Portman is lackluster and unbelievable in this kind of movie, a 'superhero (god, whatever) defeats (insert evil dude here) who wants to destroy the universe', crash bang kapow story we've heard and seen way too many times. Oh, and destroy a major metropolis in the process?any will do, as long as there are identifiable landmarks to pulverize?the destruction of which is as gratuitous as Thor delicately dabbing himself shirtless at the holy water fount, not that we're complaining. Sorry, Thor, while we appreciate your saving the nine realms and sterilizing London, it's just not going to work out?though your mother likes her, Natalie's got to be pushing 40 and you're over 5,000, you're an Odinist, she's Episcopalian? poor deity?palace annihilated, bossed by father, his mother and brother murdered, knocked about by Dark Creatures?but nothing gives the god of thunder even a grunt of discomfort but the repeated bitch slappings of the physicist scorned?

		<shortDescription>Latest adventure of "Thor" is a narrative mess</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It seems that film goers nowadays have a sudden fascination with the God of Thunder known as Thor. For three years in a row, a film based on the popular superhero has been released each year. In 2011, director Kenneth Branagh released "Thor", a solid introduction for newcomers to the comic book character. Last year, writer-director Joss Whedon brought us "The Avengers" in which Thor battled Loki and his forces with the help of Iron Man, Captain America, and the Hulk. Now, we have director Alan Taylor's "Thor: The Dark World", the latest film on the adventures of Thor and also the weakest.Summarizing the plot to this sequel is almost pointless given the narrative's sloppiness and confusion. Thor (Chris Hemsworth) is back in his home world of Asgard where he is being prepared to eventually take his father's (Anthony Hopkins) place as king of Asgard. His adopted brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston) is imprisoned in the dungeons of Asgard for his actions in the previous films mentioned earlier. When Jane Foster (Natalie Portman), Thor's love interest from Earth, is accidentally transported to another world and a powerful weapon infects her body, Thor must do what he can to save Jane's life before the Dark Elf Malekith (Christopher Eccleston) tries to destroy her.From that plot summary, it would not sound as if it was too confusing, right? Well, now let's add several subplots into the mix. These subplots involving a romantic triangle with Thor, Jane, and Thor's childhood friend Sif (Jaimie Alexander), exposition regarding Malekith, Jane hitting it off with a man on Earth, Jane's fellow scientist Erik (Stellan Skarsgard) running around naked on television (No joke), and Jane's other assistant scientist Darcy (Kat Dennings) having an intern. What makes the narrative to this film so frustrating compared to the original film is that these subplots either put the narrative to a screeching halt or are not compelling and well developed enough to belong in the story.The subplot involving Darcy and her intern could have easily been edited out since it completely distracts from the tone that this film was creating. The love triangle between Thor, Jane, and Sif could have also been taken out of the final cut since it was barely even there to begin with. Malekith is one of the most forgettable villains in recent memory due to zero character development, generic designs, and a lack of excitement on screen. Anyone who hasn't read any of the comic books based on Thor will most likely be the first to become confused by the dialogue and the plot of this film since it is that foreign to understand or even get into.What director Taylor does do well with this follow-up is incorporating challenging dilemmas for Loki between him, his foster mother (Rene Russo), and Thor. Nothing else can be discussed further on this matter since it deals with heavy spoilers, but that part is handled well. Aside from that, "Thor: The Dark World" is a narrative mess.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>About as flat as a lazy Saturday morning cartoon</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not going into details about the movie because at the heart the problem Thor has is pretty simple: It ignores a lot of the motivations of the characters on a thinly laced plot.The first Thor took a while to grow on me, but it still outdoes the second installment. But why is it a better movie than the second installment? It's mostly because the motivations of the characters and villains are clearly laid out and establishes a better impetus with the story. Loki is struggling to find out who he is, Thor is trying to become who he is expected to be, and the frost giants work out the rough edges in the story arc, the same can't be said of The Dark World.You don't have any sort of interesting dynamics between the characters and instead get references to the first movie, or things that worked for the first movie, and try to play them out again. The movie never really picks up any identity for itself and just continues to harp on the events of the Avengers as well as the lead into new films of the franchise being its primary focus which makes the plot really spread thin and boring after a while.For the sake of not repeating myself, concerning the villain that is, I'll leave it at that. Save your money.</fullReview>

Yes I know this is entertainment, and this movie was moderately entertaining, but once again the makers have tried to please everyone by adding a bit of everything; action, special effects, romance and humour, just far too much of the latter for my taste in a genre that does not require hilarity to succeed.Although it has a lower IMDb score I much preferred the 2011 Thor, a stronger storyline, darker and no laughing matter!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quite the disappointment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Thor the Dark World was quite the disappointment. Sure, it was fun to watch, but that was all, and the clichés were quite annoying. Frigga's death was perhaps the most glaring of them. And she dies for the only reason (if you can call that a reason) that they need Odin to loose control and prepare to go after Malekith like an enraged bull (which he never seems to get around to do, leaving everything to Thor once he and Loki get to leave Asgard. Also, Asgard's defenses and army were pathetic. Being caught unawares makes no sense, as Bor was supposed to know that Malekith was alive, and thus so should Odin. And even caught at unawares would not provide for such a ridiculously easy victory by the Dark Elves over Asgardian forces and such a horribly silly idea that Frigga could take care of herself (I mean, seriously, what is the good of having an army in the palace if they can't even guard the queen?). And all that so Thor could be shown as the only one that could fight the Dark Elves. And Odin only gets to kill one with Gungnir!! Of course the cliffhanger at the end was just silly. I believe we are to assume that Loki was disguised as the guard that came to announce the arrival of his "corpse" to Odin (considering the sidelong look the guard gave Odin), and thus managed to overpower him somehow (which should be very difficult indeed, but, hey, the movie is way less coherent than the comics, so...). Another thing that annoys me (that was somewhat present in the first movie, but not to this extent) is Odin's and Thor's insistence that Asgardians are not gods. They are! They are the Norse gods. Seriously, I can only think they were afraid of offending the sensibilities of Christians watching the movie, but, come one! Odin is called the All- Father because the is supposed to have created the Nine Worlds. And so on and so forth. Just boring. Ah, by the way, if Asgardians are mortal and not gods at all, why does Odin refer to Jane as "mortal"? He should have used a term like "short-lived" or something like that. Of course the magical day-saving device Erik and Jane put together is not a problem: Marvel does that all the time, like when Dr. Doom manages to create a device that steals the powers of the Beyonder, a being so powerful and alien he should be beyond the understanding of any human without centuries of studies and scientific progress. But Doom, like Reed Richards, is supposed to be a genius, which apparently means, in comic book parlance, he is wiser, more knowledgeable and more intelligent than anyone (except Reed Richards, of course. :) As a final comment, no, the film did not have the promised wider scope: the 9 reals are barely shown, Hogun's village is just as bad as any cheap Conan-like under financed TV production, Svartalfheim is just a desert filmed through darkened lenses, we just get to see enough of Asgard to, as I said, see how badly organized they are, and then we come back to Earth... again! My perfect Thor film would be if they compressed the old Colonizers of Rigel Saga into a movie. No saving the Universe (which is also a boring cliché, like, Thor will only show up on the big screen when he is saving the world), but just fighting an alien race waaaay away from Earth.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Oh was that not the name of the movie? Could have fooled me that's for sure.When people talk about this movie they often talk about how great it looks, well the budget is 170 000 000 dollars so OF COURSE it looks good.It would take the biggest idiot on earth not to be able to make it look good with that big of a budget, just hire a great director of photography, set director and CGI artists and everything will fall into place... Visually.To get it right story-wise and acting-wise of course requires a little more finesse which in reality is not the movies strong parts if we're being realistic here.The plot is messy and throw random sci fi logic (with very little actual logic) and events around like they are sprinkling an ice cream and not really seeing the full picture of what story they are trying to convey, random transportation ports and monsters for instance is very convenient to say the least.And the acting, oh no, Nathalie Portman who I usually like a lot does the definition of a phoned in performance clearly just doing the movie for the money and the rest of the cast is not that much better.But who cares about plot and acting in a Marvel movie right? Clearly not that many considering the high rating (of currently 7.1).If people asked for more than just a stylish movie and didn't sucker in just because a movie looks good and has cool action scenes then perhaps we would have gotten a little more substance to it, but clearly that is not a lot of people's priorities which is unfortunate.</fullReview>

I was expecting a SUPER-HERO movie, not a war movie. At the start the movie seems promising but as it goes on it becomes painfully obvious that little was invested towards writing an interesting plot line and script for this stinker. Evil elves versus Azgardians? Give me a break! Maybe if they make a third movie they can pit Thor against an evil villain here on Earth and the earthlings can be more than minor window dressing in the plot line.

		<shortDescription>A wasted opportunity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Thor's character, motivation and relationship to his brother Loki and with a mortal young woman has been the focus of the first Thor movie and extended into the Avengers. Yet not much was ever revealed. I went into this movie, thinking that we would learn much more about Thor, his home world, his relationship with the young woman he loves, and the consequences Loki's actions have had for Thor's family. Only a very small portion of that is ever fulfilled in this movie.Sadly, we don't see much character development, and not much consequence is given to the conflict that involves forgettable villains and schemes. The main characters are not given any time to reflect or show emotional attachment, even when one seemingly important character is killed. Furthermore the action scenes tend to be overdone, and lose interest as they go through the motions. The movie is filled with humor, and in my opinion it goes too far. There is no investment to be made for the characters. I can understand when a movie does not want to take itself too serious, but this was bordering on comedy, where I thought that lines that were delivered didn't fit the intended mood of the scenes in any way. The performances were very bland, and Loki's character seemed to be the only one believing he was in a science-fiction/fantasy world, whereas the rest of the cast were pretty much dialing it in.So a missed opportunity, not even a big budget can save it from feeling perfunctory, with too many shallow underdeveloped characters and a boring conflict that doesn't seem to carry any real depth for us to care about.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm going to be blunt, mainly because it's 5 am and I'm finally done watching this underwhelming movie.I will start with the worst port which is the main villain. Malakith seems like a mere target practice for Thor even while super powerful. He will never ever strike you as a really dangerous bad guy...and that's because he isn't. His soldier Kurse seems to be more bad-ass than him. Such a waste of a bad guy.The second bad thing is Loki. Yeah I know, people say that he is the best part...well he's both actually. Brilliant at times but severely overused. He makes the movie interesting but it gets annoying when you see that his side-story outshines the main "universe destroyer" by a mile.Third part are the funny scenes and humor. It's good to have silly jokes here and there but there are SO MANY in this movie that you can't really take anything seriously. Darcy character should be funny but It really and utterly IS NOT. All in all I wouldn't recommend this movie but it's not the worst I've seen. It will maybe make you laugh, possibly cry, and definitely feel nostalgic for THOR 1 which was way, way more clever.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thor: The Lackluster World</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>** out of **** While the first Thor generally received favorable reviews, it wasn't exactly met with acclaim. But I liked it a lot more than I had anticipated, so I thought lightning would strike twice (pun- intended), especially since this time around, reviews weren't too striking (pun-intended) for "The Dark World". With my logic, the reviews would REALLY not subside my experience of the film. Well... they were spot-on. The top critics that is. I'm not going to re-tell the synopsis for you. It's Thor. It's the sequel. There's a comic book to it and when you read a review for a blockbuster sequel, you just want to know the simple answer to a very simple question: Is the movie good? No... but let's not get too carried away with the fact it's not great, because it's not bad. So where does the problem lie?Well for starters, this movie was underwhelming as hell. With so many twists and turns, and changes in character motifs, you'd think the film would be very emotionally enveloping. But it just feels so dry, because the pacing is too abrupt to let you soak in the material. And characters just pop in and out of places, without a sense of cohesion or above-average scriptwriting. The first to me really nailed the chemistries between characters, but this one didn't make me care for anyone with the exception of- you guessed it- Thor. I found Darcy to actually be borderline obnoxious here, and Jane was just... Natalie Portman. Even Anthony Hopkins felt underused with his character.I understand being a sequel, you want to rush to the big action set pieces and show off every penny you've spent on graphics/effects, but what made the first Thor so great is while it was visually pleasing, it connected to its viewers on a more emotional level. This made for some truly epic moments and considering it took its time, the payoff was way more substantial.Also, while I viewed this in 2D, I feel it would be so unnecessary to see in 3D. No 3D moments. It doesn't seem like it'd have this grand depth of field. It just looks like a lovely 2D production.While "The Dark World" may snag an Oscar nom. for its art direction, there's a reason why the nominations stop there. I'm not saying "Thor" should aim at an Oscar (that'd be spectacular though), but just saying it should aim at least somewhat higher. With a more rushed pace, a lack of cohesion (feeling dodgy in parts), and a more than underwhelming resolution, "The Dark World" roped me into a lackluster one. It's not exactly a bad movie, but with the inflation of movie tickets, who wants to see an inferior sequel to a better-made original? (Which is cheaper to view by the way).</fullReview>

The movie was way too underdeveloped and zoomed through the plot, me and my son could not understand what was going on at times and we could not keep hold of the characters., with the exception of Loki. In addition the last hour or so of the movie became terribly predictable and extremely boring. But regardless...this movie was terrible and awful. The characters were just so superficial and very one dimensional that I did not give a hoots to what happened to any of them. Apparently the universe was in trouble, and this film managed to make that concept completely boring and uninspired. Leave end of world stuff to X-men movies. They do it better. There were also a few pitiful..attempts at humor thrown into the movie. Which were all extremely kiddie...and..childish...they fell flat...and in fact were so "unfunny" they made me cringe.

There is a good bit of comedy and emotion bouncing back and forth between Thor and Loki. Jane and Thor get back together (obviously from the picture) and Thor has been watching over her.Chris Hemsworth has been bringing peace to the 9 realms after the great Battle of New York. An old power thought to be extinct threatens Jane and the world. watch and see the twists and turns and pain they have to go to just save the world yet again.</fullReview>

I don't understand why people are hyping Loki, yes the actor that played the part did an excellent job but the actor that play Thor also did an excellent job in how he portrayed the title character . I can't honestly see anyone else as Thor. I liked nearly the entire story the movie told and I did not find the villain to be as lacking as has been claimed by some, I just accepted him for who he was. The villain make have had a different personality to differentiate him from his counter part in the marvel comics.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A visually stunning mess</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gotta say, digital eye candy can be pretty astonishing. Wish I could look at the worlds they created all day. Screensaver maybe?But as for what's going on in front of all this stunning art direction, it's all pretty ridiculous and confusing. Honestly, by the end I just got tired of things smashing and breaking for no real reason, and found myself desperately hoping the thing would just end already. The scenes with Loki were the film's saving grace; while he was around, I found myself interested. But trying to make sense out of all the rest of this slop just made me tired and frustrated. I'd gladly watch about half of it again with the sound off, and I recommend the film highly to the deaf community.Surprised to see it's so highly rated here. Well, I guess that's what passes for entertainment today.</fullReview>

It won't teach you about the wisdom of life and it won't show how difficult life can be. But what this film does good is to provide epic high-level entertainment, if you are the type of person who could relate to such kind of a fantasy movie. Chris Hemsworth is great. Natalie Portman makes a solid performance as usual.Only thing I did not like was the voice effects they used on Chris who sounds a bit like a robot. Not necessary.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Come on guys!! This was blooming awful!Bad acting, clichéd story-line, iffy effects and just a lazy, cheap,gap-filler between the really big, well financed Marvel epics such as the Avengers series.I was bored pretty much from the beginning. A hotch-potch of ideas woven into an overly complex story-line that fails to deliver on ones expectations. Token big names give the film some kudos, but again the performances are disappointing, let down by a poor script that falls into the world of geek like an Acme boulder.And why are British actors still being stereotyped by Hollywood as villains, toffs, and idiots. 11 lines of review in order to qualify to have your message uploaded. So much for freedom of speech, minimalism of thought, sparsity of speech. I therefore have to waffle on and on cuz I've said all I'm going to say about this film, as I type i'm watching it, cringing when Hopkins struggles to act.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My review of Thor: The Dark World (2013)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being directed by Alan Taylor; I had high expectations for this film, even though I don't think I've ever seen one of his films I have watched episodes he has directed for TV (The Sopranos, Rome, and Game of Thrones). Chris Hemsworth reprises his role as Thor and Natalie Portman returns as Jane to re-spark the romance that was (thankfully) left out of The Avengers. One of the first problems I noticed with the film was that the dialogue was really bad; a lot of the time it added nothing to the story or characters. An example of this is that we get the same explanation of the 'Convergence' from about three or four different characters. Yes, I get it; it's a major plot point, MOVE ON! And the time that isn't dedicated to hammering in information that we already know, is filled with unnecessary quips and one-liners. One of the worst culprits of this is Loki; there's almost an entire scene where he just makes some really terrible jokes, I just wanted him to shut up for the rest of the film. Although I will say I do actually like the character of Loki (despite the fake deaths); he is a good character played by a good actor and they do give him some great moments (His part in the ending of the film is pretty cool; don't worry I won't ruin it for you). I did feel that the relationship between him and his "mother" Frigga (Rene Russo) was a bit forced as I didn't really get the feeling of a deep connection between those two in the first film. On the other end of the spectrum; a love triangle between Thor, Jane and Sif is introduced and doesn't get built up at all throughout the film, ultimately leading to nothing anyway, so what was the point? Most of the action scenes in this film just made me question how the Asgardians had defeated the Dark Elves before, considering they have those awesome grenades. The film excels in special effects and they did a great job in creating the beautiful Asgard set. With some great music to build the excitement of the scene, it proved to be a really enjoyable piece of action. I was very disappointed to realise that Malekith (Christopher Eccleston) is a terrible villain; firstly I downright didn't like the look of the Dark Elves, their motive was really bad; they don't like the light though at most it's of a slight annoyance to them, like a fly that keeps flying in front of your face (doesn't mean you have to destroy the universe). The Dark Elf on steroids was really the antagonist; if you're going to watch the film, watch it for this guy, he's pretty cool, Malekith just ends up looking like the damsel in distress. The ending was nothing inspired; the teleporting around was pretty cool but the novelty wore off after the second time. I hated how they end up defeating Malekith; it was boring and predictable and made no lasting impression. All in all this film was below average. Though I thought the directing and special effects were very good, the writing on the other hand was awful; it had bland characters and an uninteresting story filled with pointless dialogue. Even the actors didn't seem to care about this movie. Some of the action scenes were good but that was mostly down to the visual effects and music. And even though it was nice not to have Loki as the antagonist; Malekith was just plain awful.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lazy writing leads to lots of missed opportunities</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me start immediately with my major gripe; the writing is awful across the board; the story, the dialogue and the action are all extremely bland.Ten minutes into the movie, the story appears to be identical to that of Avengers, and it stays like that until the end. An immense old power is found, the good guys try to destroy it and the bad guys use it to take over the world. The power is nondescript and functions as a deus ex throughout the film. The big disappointment is that, you don't get a good demonstration of what this power is until 90 minutes into the movie, and without spoiling too much I can say that it really isn't that much of a threat at all, just like the relatively small army of aliens in the Avengers wasn't much of an actual threat either. I truly can't imagine any way the premise of the movie could have been worse. Copying the premise right from your last major release and making the bad guys even less of a threat...The dialogue consists mostly of cheesy one-liners, which doesn't help making the relationship between Thor and his family, and him and Jane more interesting, even though things got of to a reasonably good start in the first Thor movie. There's hardly any real tension save for the most textbook cliché's with Thor challenging his father in an argument, where the king's position is portrayed as such a blatant idiocy he loses all his stature.The enemies are 'dark elves' which all look identical and about which we learn absolutely zero-squat except that they are invisible to everything and everyone unless they need to be beaten by a bunch of Asgardians to aid the progression of the 'story'.Meanwhile, we visit Asgard, but we learn nothing about it either. We see identical and disposable soldiers/guards and a king sitting in a large EMPTY palace, and that's all. The one star I gave is for the rare moment of humor and displacement when the queen of Asgard briskly tells Jane to do everything she tells her to without question, and Jane immediately realizes that this woman who's bossing her around is not just a demigod but also her new mother in law. There is so much more room for stuff like this, however it's never used.The fighting choreography is awful; mainly lot's of close-ups of elbows hitting prop-armor. The tactics of Asgard's armies are those of kindergarten play-warfare; run forward and shoot, nothing more.Truly a lackluster affair..</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Thor - the dark world' has some good moments, particularly the gags and the characters of Loki and Thor himself, but most of the rest is bloated CGIsville and ham portentousness. The plot is straight out of 'Lord of the Rings.' The dark side of life portrayed by the Black Elves (very reminiscent of The Teletubbies!) are rising (originally the Universe was dark until Thor's Grandad sent them packing and brought the Light). However, the Elves' main ultimate weapon - the Aether (cue misty red smoke) - was not destroyed but buried beneath a fifties car park in East London!!!! Where's that Ring when you need it?! Thor's girlfriend (Natalie Portman - the Elves are taller than her!)discovers it and becomes a carrier - fortunately she does not suffer Gollum's fate of disfigurement. Now that would have been a plot twist! The rest of the film is the Black Elves trying to get hold of the Aether while Thor, Loki and assorted London-based Earthlings attempt to prevent them. The best bit is the relationship between Thor and Loki with some good acting from Hemsworth and Hiddlestone, but the attack on Asgard is a copy of Michael Shannon's rebellious effort on Krypton, and from then on in the plot holes get bigger and bigger. True, the destruction of Greenwich - as Thor and Chief Baddie battle it out - does not go on as long as 'Man of Steel' in New York, but is a yawnfest. Isn't it about time that audiences started to give these Comic book adaptations the b**'s rush? They are getting so similar and boring.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Incredibly generic apart from an inspired final act</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Thor: The Dark World' basically plays out exactly as one would expect from a Marvel Universe movie. There are many wisecracks, fights, explosions and post credit scenes. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, it's just that a good 75 ? 80% of the film gives off an aura of 'been there, done that'. Of all the Marvel Universe films that have been released thus far, beginning with the fantastic 'Ironman' in 2008 and most recently at the time of writing with the average 'Guardians of the Galaxy' in 2014, this second film starring the God of Thunder would rank close to the bottom, but although since all but one Marvel Universe film is 'OK' at the least, that's still saying that even the lesser films of this saga are only just entertaining and nothing more.Chris Hemsworth and Tom Hiddleston give the only performances of note as the two main characters, with Hemsworth again owning the role and Hiddleston showing Loki's sneaky and cunning side with amusing results (A scene where Loki transforms into different characters, including a certain Captain, is one of the few genuinely imaginative and entertaining parts of the film.) The only problem I have with Loki is that, during the first half especially, he just isn't in the movie enough. For roughly half the running time, Loki is reduced to sitting in a prison cell by himself, which isn't high on the list of the many things I want to watch Loki do. Apart from these two, none of the other actors are particularly memorable, which is a shame since there are great actors like Natalie Portman and Anthony Hopkins in the film as well. No one in the film gives a bad performance, it's just that the performances are only serviceable and nothing more. For example, take the villain, Malekith played by Christopher Eccleston. Malekith growls and snarls in both English and Dark Elfish in a deep menacing voice, complete with threatening villain features and a plan to destroy the universe (I wonder though, what a boring life that must be if your plan to destroy the universe actually succeeds). Malekith is the definition of a bland, stereotypical villain in an Action/Adventure/Fantasy/Sci-Fi film. He does nothing interesting, his plans are conventional, he possesses no individual or memorable characteristics, his lines are never witty and even his physical appearance is bland and generic. This is a shame since he is played by Christopher Eccleston, an actor I like very much and whom I know can pull off memorable villains. This then begs the question, why hire a good actor like Eccleston only to alter his voice, have him speak gibberish and obscure him in makeup so that he is close to unrecognizable? You might as well hire some random guy off the street of roughly the same height/build to play the character if there's that much makeup and alterations rather than hire a professional. Lots of money could be saved and hardly anyone would notice.The whole film, except for the inspired finale, has a run-of-the-mill feel to it. Other aspects, such as the direction, cinematography, production design and score feel bland and workmanlike. The composer of the film is Brian Tyler, whose work I usually enjoy very much, but he phones it in here, offering standard order action movie music. Usually I find Tyler's work has a distinct personal stamp to it, with him being especially good at subtly emotional cues in the midst of action movies (For example, his work on 'Eagle Eye', 'Battle: Los Angeles' and even 'Thor: The Dark World's cousin, 'Ironman 3') but none of that was evident here. Alan Taylor directs most of the film with no personal style or flair (Much unlike Kenneth Branagh from the first 'Thor' film) until the truly inspired and entertaining finale which is a nice break from watching cities getting obliterated by otherworldly beings in action films nowadays. I won't spoil but I will say that this is where the film truly becomes entertaining and I only wish that the preceding 80 minutes or so had been as fun and creative as the final act. Let's just hope that director Alan Taylor's next film, 'Terminator: Genisys', is more in the vein of the final 20 minutes of 'Thor: The Dark World' and not the other 80 minutes of boring, generic action and exposition.Finally, one problem I have with not just this film, but the entire Marvel Universe, is that in each new standalone adventure, the stakes are always low, which doesn't exactly make for edge-of-your-seat viewing. Because whatever happens to Thor, Ironman, Captain America or anybody major, you know they'll survive because A: The film will extensively tease what's to come, B: The next film will most likely already be in production, C: Even if a character does die then they usually find a way to revive and D: Marvel has already planned out their films until at least the end of the decade. Combine the knowledge of all these factors while watching a Marvel film such as this one and the result is incredibly uninvolving. There may be lots of action, but it is rarely exciting, since you know that these characters will defeat the enemy and be all ready for the next adventure. In the end, 'Thor: The Dark World' feels less like a movie and more like a product, only here as filler to advertise and build up to what's to come, while unfortunately forgetting to create a unique identity or personality all its own.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wanted to give this sequel a shot as the two attempts I tried with the first movie failed miserably to please but I had heard from a friend that this one is different, I know not how.. From the beginning we have a poor plot, like most Marvel movies. For some reasons, Dark futuristic space Elves want to wipe out the world that they failed eons ago. Taking too much out of the great battle of the Lord The Rings, the Elves are broken and exiled, promising to return with a weapon to destroy and rule all life *cough one ring* Meanwhile somewhere else in the space time spectrum, Thor and his cliché mundane battle brethren who seem as out of place as the swords and axes with their stupid cross over space ships, grenades and guns, are waging war with other.. things not explained. Returning after certain victory with Thor on their side, our Northen hero in space gets an itch that tells him that whats her face, Jane I think, comes into danger by stupidly touching an alien and obviously evil substance. Oddly enough she isn't abducted by a secret American syndicate, something I thought was definitely going to happen with this plot but alas, it's more simple. Jane is brought to Valhalla as they are the ones to remove said evil substance where we are sadly subjected to Hokins horrible over acting( a shame), Loki being as ordinary as ever( really we have seen this character in a lot of movies, The black sheep of the ruling family intent on taking it over) Loki is in jail, Loki is suddenly not in jail, fight between siblings, more fights, more fights in more stupid sword and gun cross overs, fights on Earth and some professor without pants, obviously a Stan lee cameo ( the only laugh) and more fighting with a nice little boring love moment, all wrapped up in a foreseeable and weak excuse for a plot twist. Pretty visuals... that's really about it that's worth it. I was sad to see Chris D in it. I really just wish movies with such a huge budget put money to novels or more thought out comics with better plots and less stupid content.Thor had great visuals, Decent enough typical blockbuster action and an Australian. 3/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Solid blockbuster with good mix of effects and entertainment, although needed to play to its strengths more</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Years of disappointment and bad experiences have told me that most summer blockbusters are not the event movies that the advertisements would like you to believe; yes they are about the spectacle but with large TVs and strong sound systems being the norm now, it is not a big loss to enjoy such films in your home away from talking people, mobile phones, crowds and inflated prices. So it was with the Thor sequel. The original film had been pretty good but seemed cluttered with introductions and franchise stuff. The second film doesn't have so much of this and it mostly works pretty well although it must be said that it never seems to consistently play to its strengths.The plot does seem to link to Marvel lore that fans will appreciate but for the casual viewer it works well enough to do the job without knowing too much. Basically some dark power has escaped and Jane has been exposed to it making her a target for some dark elves who seek to destroy everything. Thor must not only protect her but also destroy the dark power before it can be harnessed by the elves ? a task he can only perform with the help of Loki, currently rotting away in a cell. As a plot it sets up lots of confrontation and this is the main thing we are here for, so in that regard it works well enough. That said, it doesn't seem to be able to do enough of its better stuff.The better stuff tends to be the less serious material; Thor is a character and a story steeped in serious words and big Norse gods whereas Iron Man (for example) has a playboy at its centre, thus making the fun and swagger easier to come by. This film benefits from Loki being fun and playful as a villain and when he is around the film is better; there are a few other aspects where the playful fun comes in but mostly it is associated with Loki and there are frankly too few of these scenes. The fun adds to the entertainment value and while it does still work without it, it doesn't work quite as well.The special effects are good though and if you are looking for distracting noise and spectacle then this does the trick ? perhaps not enough to hold your full attention but perfectly fine if you wish to switch off the brain to a certain extent. The cast act well considering they are mostly on a green screen. Hemsworth gets the balance right between playing a big god and also having a bit of fun, his only issue is sometimes the material doesn't let him do this. Portman is not so much of a presence although she does well enough and she has good chemistry with Hemsworth. Hiddleston gets the best material and has fun with it. Hopkins booms out his lines and Eccleston is a good (but unrecognizable) villain. Support is good from Alexander, Stevenson, Russo, Dennings, Skarsg?rd and others, while HBO fans will enjoy seeing two very strong characters from two shows represented by Akinnuoye- Agbaje (Oz) and Elba (The Wire).This isn't an amazing film but it is a solid blockbuster with good effects and plenty going on. I prefer it when it mixes some fun into the more faux-heavy dialogue and I'm not sure why it doesn't do this more often but it still works pretty well if you're in the mood for effects- driven action and spectacle.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If there ever was one character from The Avengers that I was least interested in, that'd be?.(No not HawkEye, cmon give that guy a break)? Thor. Yes the Asgardian Odinson, the God of Thunder. And blame that on the 2010 movie Thor. Compared to other Marvel movies at the time, I found Thor to be lackluster. There was action, there were epic set- pieces, there was fish-outta-water comedy and most of all was the origin story of Thor and Loki who'd be seen more in the upcoming The Avengers. But while Iron Man, The Incredible Hulk set the perfect stage for The Avengers, Thor's origin story faltered at it. I could only see it as a companion piece to the Marvel Phase One and nothing else.Directed by Alan Taylor, who's directed a whole bunch of HBO Shows, Thor The Dark World's story takes place in Asgard and London, presumably coz New York was still in ruins post the incidents from The Avengers. And our world's once again at stake, all thanks to the Dark Elf Malekith and Thor is instinctively called upon by Jane Foster who, of all the people, stumbles on the very thing Malekith wants?some gooey evil thing called the Aether. We are once again counting on Thor to save the day (or save Jane). Thor The Dark World is as drab as the original but I was impressed with the pacing of the movie. It had a lot of fun moments as well touchy drama sprinkled around. Usually I'd be taking mental notes when the movie gets drab but Thor The Dark World didn't give a chance for that. Was it coz the movie was that good? NO! Was it entertaining? YES! I was constantly thrown around from one set piece to another. The movie also cleverly manages to incorporate several nods to The Avengers and its upcoming sequel as well S.H.I.E.L.D., as the story progressed.Chris Hemsworth once again dorns his Asgardian armor and cape as the Thor and he was very much in character and makes me wonder if he's always so. Then again, having seen his Red Dawn, I need not raise a bet. I was not a Loki fan, neither in Thor nor in The Avengers. But here he was just mind blowing. I'd say this one is one of his finest performances ever. A real show stealer! And a particular scene with a grief stricken Loki showed every bit of it. An immediate comparison would be to Heath Ledger's Joker but we all know that ain't so.To my surprise, the gorgeous Natalie Portman, once again takes up the role of Jane Foster. Is she being a good Samaritan not leaving the role for somebody else? Or is she really rooting to play the role again? An actress of such caliber does need her own break and I suppose Jane Foster makes for a wonderful one. Christopher Eccleston plays Malekith with admirable sincerity but I felt his character was severely underwritten and towards the end he felt lesser and lesser intimidating.Kat Dennings is just plain annoying. I don't know why. Despite the few smirks that her Darcy delivered, she felt more like a character which was being dragged onto this one just coz she was there in the first one. Other notable roles include Zachary Levi's Fandral, Idris Elba's Heimdall and an old but exceptionally well-acted Odin by Anthony Hopkins. And btw I feel Jaimie Alexander would make a spectacular Diana (Wonder Woman).If you can forgive the weak story and its tendency to inject humor at odd moments, Thor The Dark World is thoroughly enjoyable and will be entertaining even for people not keeping up with the Marvel Phases. I for one, was glad that as a stand alone movie, it entertains and excels more than its predecessor.PS: Stay back for two shawarmas after the credits roll.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is in no way a knock on the first Thor because I enjoyed it a lot, but, as said with Captain America: The Winter Soldier, Thor: The Dark World impressed me more. The look of the film is wonderful, Asgard is just as colourful as it was in Thor yet also darker too, matching the darker, bolder tone very well. The photography and editing are stylish and the locations, especially Iceland, are stunningly vivid. The special effects are even more dazzling than in Thor and the same can be said for the stunts. The music score by Brian Taylor is dynamic and never repetitive or pedestrian, adding to the action sequences rather than detracting. Speaking of the action sequences, they are packed with thrills with battles almost on scale of Lord of the Rings and smack-downs that are enough to crush the bones. But Thor: The Dark World is not just about action and spectacle, it has substance too(or at least it did to me), laden with humour that will genuinely make you laugh but doing so without over-powering the dark nature of the story or the tense sparring between Thor and Loki. The story is compelling with the right doses of action, humour and drama, it's bigger in scale and bolder in tone than the first Thor but also more expansive in characterisation. The acting is top-class with most of the cast getting more to do, Anthony Hopkins is always dependable and Natalie Portman brings a touch of class and Stellan Skarsgard has some very funny moments but the acting honours do go to Chris Hemsworth, who's more robust and poised than he was in the first Thor, and especially Tom Hiddleston, who is terrific as Loki and pitches his mellifluousness and serpentine-like malevolence perfectly. My only complaints here are Christopher Eccleston having very little to do so he gives a somewhat one-dimensional performance that exudes moody menace but not much else and Loki surrendering and Thor forgiving him too easily and quickly. All in all however, a truly excellent follow-up that improves even more over the first Thor. 9/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

Spoiler alert in next few lines. Trying to pose Loki as changed person as a twist? Too Predictable. What was more annoying was getting rid of him instantly. If you dig in a twist in story, you let it sink, not flush it away. They should try to make a low selling game instead. Hope the mistakes are learnt and the pathetic twist and prequel to possible 5 to go are made better. watchable :p. Adios</fullReview>

Because of shallow plot, this movie will fail to take you along. In these kind of movies Villains are very powerful and invincible. But heroes look for out of the box solutions to get them down but in this movie Villain character is very weak and is without any convention. Villain doesn't look intelligent and dangerous to me. He was just a villain to fill space. Good news is there are 2-3 laughs as well though I didn't laugh as I found them not very laughable.Direction was OK. Acting was good as normally is in these kind of Films. Portman was bit better. This movie has high production value. Lot of effort and money used in creating stunning visual effects.So my suggestion to readers is that "Don't watch it in 3D" specially if you have watched Gravity in 3D recently. You will feel very bad like me. And will curse 3D technology which I think is mind blowing if used properly.Its OK for one time watch but nothing memorable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The World's in danger; let's laugh about it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As much as the action is intense and the special effects are stunning, the film - in my opinion - was ironically rather dull. There where a few things that made me lose concentration and interest in the film. For example in the middle of a big destruction filled scene, they try to make you laugh. Why? the whole purpose of an action scene is to become fixated on the screen, to hold your breath while chaos ensues. Not to make you laugh. But OK, the action scene resumes and it build and builds and then....yes they try to make you laugh again. And why? Well because when you strip back everything; when you retract the unnecessary comedy; when you holster the money making action scenes; the story is dull. So, they inject a lethal dose of comedy and romance to try and distract you. And hey, there's nothing wrong with adding comedy to give a more varied experience for the viewer, but doing it in the midst of a Malekith (the so called villain of the film; played admirably by Christopher Eccleston) attack is preposterous; all it does is undermine the fear factor that the villain is supposed to carry; he may as well have been wearing a t shirt saying "i have no chance". And it was constant; no real focus on the villain, just little bits here and there. Him and his cronies may as well have been at Santa's workshop preparing for Christmas.Let's build a "monster" of a villain and laugh him to death. The World's seemingly beginning it's end and unless you are a scientist you are running for your life. That's basically the story of the film, with also too much happening in it. In order for a superhero film to succeed it has to focus; although profits would disagree with me. But it is because of the special effects that people empty their pockets, to be in the cinema and hear the roar of Thor's hammer, the rumble of explosions. Not the story. Look at Batman's latest outing, three films focusing on the darker side of a superhero; it was simple, the villains where built to be feared. It stayed on track, and apart from one or two one liners in each film, there wasn't any need for comedy because the story was so good. Thor, like Iron Man, Like Avengers will always make money,they will always be blockbusters. But they are not solely superhero films, there is always another character who is just as important as the hero and that should not be the case; unless of course it is the villain and in this film there is no sign of that. The villain is vanilla and when you don't have a great villain, then the hero cannot reach greatness. Action was amazing but everything else was uninspiring.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More like a Star Wars retread, only with the Marvel label.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Following the fast-paced and adrenaline-pumping Marvel film Thor, this sequel pales in comparison. It features the return of super god Thor (Chris Hemsworth), who tries to save Dr. Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) after she gets cursed with a powerful entity known as the Aether. However, an evil race called the Dark Elves wants the Aether to conquer the universe.This movie was rather slow and at times, boring - just a lot of talk that really goes no where. The overdone special effects made the movie look like a Star Wars retread and a story appeared it couldn't make up its mind if it's a drama or comedy. At certain poignant moments, the characters didn't really show any emotion, with the plot not allowing time for the audience to generate any sympathy. And, much of the comedy were very corny and lame, making you not wanting to take this film seriously.Hemsworth and Portman still had some good chemistry and did their best in their acting with what they were provided. Thor's fellow warrior comrades, Sif (Jaimie Alexander), Fandral (Zachary Levi), Volstagg (Ray Stevenson) and Hogun (Tadanobu Asano) were great in the film, but sorely underused. I could have really done without the corny Darcy Lewis (Kat Dennings) and her clueless intern - really lame jokes and dialog offered by them, and they served no real purpose in the movie as a result from their dumb performances.There were dabs of exciting action scenes here and there, as well as a suspenseful plot point where Thor have to rely on his not-so-friendly brother, Loki (Tom Hiddleston) for help. But overall, there's really nothing new in this movie - just another hero vs. villain-who-wants-to-conquer-the-world story with messy CGI effects.Grade D+</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>All action no substance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think my one major issue with Thor is that he is so vapid. I'm also not entirely sure that a second movie was required to tell a nonexistent story. If Thor had something to say or even more substance then I could see the benefit in this movie. The whole thing is filled with arrogant one-liners and pointless statements. There are some brilliant action sequences but overall it's lacking in emotion. Even the actors seem a little lacklustre and not fully committed to their roles. It should be better as there is so much talent in this cast but a bad script will always hurt a movie.I know I'm going to cope flack for this but Thor is certainly the worst marvel superhero that has been turned into a movie. He's one-dimensional and barely deserves his hero title. Watch it if you enjoy an action movie with no storyline cause that is exactly what you'll get.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tired.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now before I start, I want to make it absolutely clear of 2 things; 1. I liked the original Thor movie, it wasn't great but I'd call it entertaining enough that, if anyone wanted me to sit through it again, I wouldn't object. 2. I know that this might sound like "Oh, Morbius is just going on with the same old thing, he didn't like The Avengers so he obviously will just blindly hate on every Marvel film" no, I can assure you, in this review I have measured up each pro and con as fairly as I can.The plot is basically the same thing you've seen in a ton of these films; bad guy tries to take over the world, hero tries to stop them and get a love interest into the mix. There isn't that much else besides that. Its been done to death in these films and for the most part, done better.However, I do have to defend other aspects of this film before I get to the complaints. Firstly, the CGI is amazingly well done. The acting is from just about every player, pretty solid, the action scenes are all really well done and I'll at least say, its watchable.Now onto the complaints, now you would've probably seen the first film. Assemble in your mind each and every single complaint; the love relationship is underdeveloped, the humor is bad, the writing is bare bones simplicity and it under uses the movie's best talent. This film has all of those things but to a worse off degree than the first. As if, instead of saying "How do we improve this over the original?" they said "How do we make more flaws in writing than the original?"First off, the movie's talent is just, as I've said twice, under used so much that its pretty much ridiculous. Stellan Skarsgard is the worst one because as much as Anthony Hopkins and Christopher Eccleston are under played, at least they don't have this god awful humor. What passes off as a joke in this film? Skarsgard running around Stonehenge naked, Skarsgard not wearing pants, and the oh so funny antics of Kat Dennings, even though the Jar Jar Binks comparisons are a little harsh, she's still pretty bad.The love relationship is just terrible in this movie. Natalie Portman and Chris Hemsworth have little to no chemistry and most of that, I blame on the writing. Now, okay, when it comes to other blockbusters where Portman played the love interest, it had worse writing (STAR WARS EPISODE 2) but in this, they share little to no scenes together, they barely talk to each other alone (and wouldn't she question "hey, what was up with that alien army I saw you fighting on TV?") and they don't even say goodbye to each other when the film ends. However, to their credit, both actors are trying, good god are they trying, but nothing works and after reading that, how can it? Apparently the Bifrost Bridge is repaired...out of nowhere, so what is keeping them apart? In the first one, it was made clear, in this one, its like Thor has ADD and can't decide whether he wants to be with her or not. But, oh, that would ruin Marvel's formula. Um...f#ck formula! The Marvel formula has been in use since 2008 and its getting tired! Captain America 2 had the "f#ck formula!" attitude and its by far the best Phase 2 movie.So, overall, I don't hate this film, there are certainly good things about it but enough for me to like it? No. While its not the worst I've ever seen, it is an annoying film with the "playing it safe" bland formula Marvel has decided on what works. Hello. Can just one Hollywood movie take a risk? That's what makes people remember it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>great fun and exciting superhero movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dark Elves are an ancient nemesis to Asgard. Their leader Malekith (Christopher Eccleston) tried to use Aether to send the universe into darkness. In a great battle, the Dark Elves were routed, Malekith managed to escape and Asgard buried the Aether beyond use. It's many years later in the present day. Loki (Tom Hiddleston) is imprisoned. Thor (Chris Hemsworth) is fighting to bring order back to the nine realms. Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) is alone on Earth since Thor left her in New Mexico 2 years ago. She's now in London with her intern Darcy Lewis (Kat Dennings) who in turns has her own intern. Erik Selvig (Stellan Skarsg?rd) has gone a little crazy and very naked. Jane is doing research on an anomaly which Asgard and the Dark Elves call Convergence. She gets sent through a wormhole to Svartalfheim where she's impregnated with all the Aether. Thor brings Jane back to Asgard despite Odin (Anthony Hopkins)'s disapproval.This is a lighter and jokier affair. Its broad jokes delivered mostly by Kat Dennings playing the traditional best friend rom-com role to Natalie Portman. Portman continues to be a weak point in this franchise. It's more her Jane Foster character who really lacks consistent chemistry and reason for their love affair. This is a love that spans the universe and I can't explain it other than they're both played by really gorgeous human specimens.The best parts are that the world of Asgard is expanded more. It's not just a set but a real place now. The movie gives a real sense of it. Also Thor and Loki expands their relationship. Their brotherly rivalry is deeper this time and Loki is set to become a big Marvel character in the future. Malekith is a slight disappointment as the villain. Quite frankly, all the usual fun villainy characteristics are given to Loki while Malekith is merely a one dimensional plot device. Malekith is really only a secondary character and maybe that's a good thing. The battles are great. The final battle is thrilling with a lot of fun. That's how I would describe the movie as a whole.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thor: The Dark World. The writers must have been hammered.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Maleikith (Christopher Eccleston) leader of the Dark Elves possesses the Aether, a weapon with which he intends to destroy Asgard. Thor, (Chris Hemsworth) prince of the Nine Realms, doesn't want to be King of the Nine Realms, but neither does he trust his evil brother Loki (Tom Huddleston) to be King of the Nine Realms either. When trying to slip through a wormhole to try to meet Thor, Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) is infused with the Aether, and given supernatural powers. Malekith wants to retrieve the Aether from Jane to destroy Asgard and the Nine Realms. Thor can't kill Malekith by himself, he needs the help of his brother Loki. Does Loki help Thor or join forces with Malekith? What happens to the Aether?Thor is when the Marvel cannon of characters hits the bottom of the barrel. Thor is the weakest of all the Marvel superheroes in my opinion, a Norse god with a hammer as a weapon. What's so super about that? The mythology around him is weak, Asgard is not exactly Krypton, Thor is hardly Batman, or even Spiderman, there is nothing compelling about the character, and unlike Iron Man, neither the story nor the character draw the viewer in. I don't care about Thor, or his rivalry with Loki, so what is left is a story with no plot development, no character development, and a movie that jumps form action sequence to action sequence, from special effect to special effect, with no rhyme or reason. And the terminology just sounds like so much gobbledygook. What the heck is Aether, the convergence, the Dark Elves, the Nine Realms? What do the Dark Elves do? Bake evil cookies? This movie suffers from the same problem as the Avengers, a scant plot, underdeveloped characters, and a rush to get to the action scenes and special effects. Again, it took six people to write this dreck, did they take turns writing in crayon?Chris Helmworth is a wooden actor, he brings no dimension to this character. Hemsworth seems only interested in creating a larger than life character, but he brings nothing else to the role. Tom Huddleston is not a menacing presence, neither is Christopher Eccleston. Natalie Portman can be a good actress when given a good script, but she's back in Queen Amidalla mode here, she has very little to say, trying to sound important but is only used as a love interest and damsel in distress. Anthony Hopkins is brought in once again to try to class up the proceedings, it doesn't work. For more Thor-ough reviews, visit my blog, reviewswithatude.wordpress.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While this is a continuation and some people might eventually get fed up with all the superhero movies, this really is a nice follow up, not only to the Avengers, but especially to the first Thor. Whereas you had Thor as fish out of water in that one, this time around someone else takes over that department.It's also very nice to see Natalie Portman back again, her missing out on the Avengers. There is always some reason why the other Avengers are not present and I guess you could question that, but you would take a lot from your own movie watching experience if you did. Plus you have enough on your plate here (or on your screen to be exact), that holds your attention. The mood and the fine line this walks (fantasy and comedy) continues, even though the reigns were handed from Branagh to a Game of Thrones director. Good choice it seems ...</fullReview>

IRON MAN 3 looked very different than the other Marvel movies. I went to the theaters to see if my friends were right. IRON MAN 3 was amazing. Shane Black did an amazing job. Robert Downey Jr. was remarkably great in this film. He did something that he didn't do in the other IRON MAN movies. Overall, the movie was unique and funny at some moments. Then, THOR: THE DARK WORLD came out...I didn't get to catch it in the theaters so I downloaded it. I jumped on my couch and turned the TV on.The movie was absolutely spectacular and just plain awesome!! I mean the effects were so revolutionary that it feels like I'm actually in one of the Nine Realms. I loved the performances by Chris Hemsworth and Natalie Portman. But Tom Hiddleston did an incredible job portraying Loki. Alan Taylor did an amazing job here. The story was good and unique as well.Hang on, though. This will not be the last you'll here from Thor (and Tony Stark too)..</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The rating on this is justifiably declining now that the "honeymoon" period is over. From a plot point of view, there are no surprises with everything that happens pretty well announced before it happens, resulting in very little suspense. So I am not ticking the spoiler box because the film spoils itself.The most annoying thing for me was the long drawn-out aftermath of Friga's death being accompanied by music which is a repetitive rip-off from the Lord of the Rings score, and is even more boring than the original. I just don't understand why more effort isn't put into film scores these days.</fullReview>

I thought that Natalie Portman who played "Jane Foster" did better in this movie than the first one because she was cooler and tougher. Tom Hiddleston who played "Loki" he can be dramatic, funny, and mean. He has some great personalities. Christopher Eccleston who played "Malekith" was one of the toughest super villains in the "Marvel Cinematic Universe Phase 2" so far. He was unstoppable compared to Loki.I thought that Brian Tyler did a great job of making "Thor The Dark World" soundtrack and it's themes, it sounded beautiful.This movie should've been the beginning of the "Marvel Cinematic Universe Phase 2", because "Iron Man 3" SUCKED, big time!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It was okay. Watchable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Dark Elves want to destroy and shut out the light from the Universe. Their leader, Malekith (Christopher Eccleston) searches for the Aether, an indestructible force and finds it in Jane (Natalie Portman). Say what? Thor (Chris Hemsworth) must find a way to save Jane and defeat the Dark Elves. Thor needs the help of his brother, Loki (Tom Hiddleston) who is in prison by order of his father Odin (Anthony Hopkins).This was okay, but the CGI sets showcased all you see and they are spectacular. The action scenes are very good. The only comedic lines were uttered by Loki and to be truthful Loki steals the show. I suppose the professor running naked at the Stonehenge site was funny to some, not to me. It wasn't funny and didn't add much to the story. Why have it? Not much happens between Thor and Jane although she had been waiting for his return for 2-years. This was okay, but the Convergence when the 9-Realms line up to a point when Malekith can use the Aether to destroy the known universe should have made us pause and be concerned, but that didn't happen. Things happened too fast and we knew Thor would be triumphant. It's really not good to say that we just didn't care, but we didn't. This was okay, but for a civilization as advanced like the Asgards their weapons of choice only seemed to be knives and swords and we did see the Dark Elves use what looked like ray-guns. Oh, yes, Thor has his Hammer. Knives and swords? Give me a break. This was okay only because of the action scenes and sets design and they were very good. Now for the dilemma: Two people die in this. What will a sequel bring us without them? One is kind of important to the Thor story. Huh? However, there is that scene at the very end that confused me and may confuse you too. (5/10)Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: No.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to admit to biased reviewing when it comes to this and some other franchises. That means I can be forgiving but also heavy with criticism. For example, Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines incurred my wrath not because of the monumental task of succeeding T2JD, but because the cut was so terrible. By the same token, I welcomed Terminator: Salvation although it wasn't as good as I hoped it would be.That's pretty much where I'm at with this sequel. I thought it had a lot going for it but the execution could have been much better. The film was made for the masses certainly, but they didn't have to spend so much time on the setup to the anomalies discovered by the children at the warehouse. They could have visited a story arc involving Sif and Thor.Likewise, Loki wasn't necessary for my entertainment here. I really like Hiddleston's characterization of Loki and I know its difficult-to-impossible to tell a tale of Asgard without him but I don't feel this installment was well served with so much screen time dedicated to Loki. At certain times, I felt like I was watching a rehash of the discussion atop the rocky outcropping in The Avengers. I like Darcy too, but again, too much screen time for (in this case) a non-integral character at the expense of more interesting story lines.Malekith was a bit underdeveloped even with the prologue to explain his purpose. He could have been a little more fleshed out, but again, I understand the challenges facing the writers in the Hollywood environment we are stuck with. I would gladly trade all the screen time dedicated to Darcy for more back-story of the antagonist.The treatment of everything Asgard was wonderfully executed and believable. Yet, when compared to how the Earthlings interacted with the immortals (I didn't like how Jane treated Thor or Loki at first even if the tie-in to the events of The Avengers justified her reactions) it made Asgard seem like a slapstick version of itself.Even if the script had too much story where story wasn't needed and some interesting points that would have been a better investment, my overall take on the movie is a 5/10 even as a fan of the Marvel universe. As the Iron Man installments went, sequels aren't always able to captivate this viewer because of many different things. I tried to like this film and I do to some extent, but I'm glad I waited to view it on Amazon Prime as opposed to what it would have cost me to see it at the movie theater.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As the "pre titles" - history section - to the story tells you, the bad guy - Malekith the Accursed - creates an ultimate weapon to rule the universe, gets stopped, and goes away plotting his revenge. That should give more than enough scope to have large scale battles between the protagonists, plenty of opportunity for Thor to run around smashing righteous thunder into anything he encounters. Like Gimli in Lord of the Rings, but with Legolas's hair. Yet the battles are more one on one. The acting may be strong in parts (which is to be expected with Portman, Hopkins and Skarsg?rd), yet it would have been good to see some more of Eccleston as the main protagonist. And you can tell that Malekith has spent his time not only plotting, but also in R&amp;D, while the Asgardians haven't learnt much from the previous film. Not to mention the number of pillars that get destroyed, no wonder the world is dark! Hiddleston shines as the tricky Loki, with the rage of a son betrayed by his father, the despair of a son lost to his mother and the contempt of a betrayed and lost brother. He may have been the obvious figure head of evil in Avengers Assemble, but here he gets to play a full range of roles and comes out as the real star of the show. And despite knowing Zachary Levi was playing Fandral, if I hadn't I wouldn't have recognised him with the blonde hair!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Thor: The Dark WorldThe upside to being the God of Thunder is that you have a solid excuse every time you fart.Thankfully, the fair-haired deity in this action movie isn't passing gas.When a cosmic event creates porticos between realms, Thor's (Chris Hemsworth) girlfriend Jane (Natalie Portman) travels through one portal and ends up being contaminated by an ancient weapon.Jane's contagion awakenings a Dark Elf (Christopher Eccleston) who wants to use her ailment to bring about the elves evil empire.To prevent this, Thor must collaborate with his greatest enemy - his incarcerated half- brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston).And it's solely that brotherly interplay that makes this sequel acceptable.While all the exciting elements of the original are present, Dark World lacks a villain with enough oomph to save a simplistic script that fails to venture beyond its comic book derivation.Incidentally, the Mighty Thor is the ideal Halloween costume for Jesus.

		<fullReview>Solid title, lets hope it really is dark...yeah right. Its only been two years and we have another Thor adventure. The first film wasn't too bad considering the source material is a tough cookie to film, so I went into this sequel with a relatively positive outlook. So far Marvel has done us proud so why worry.Oh dear, now I would mention the plot outline briefly, as normal, but put simply...I can't. The reason being I genuinely don't really understand what I just saw. I haven't been this confused in a film since I don't know. The bad guys in this film are called Dark Elves which sounds pretty sweet admittedly...and kinda 'Warhammer-ish'. They all look quite cool with their creepy gaunt expression-less masks on and their leader Malekith also looks really good and evil...and kinda 'Hellboy 2-ish'. You could also say they all feel a tad like Stormtroopers especially with all the lasers being fired everywhere, was that laser fire? looked like it.The Star Wars similarities became even worse when the elves started attacking Asgard in rather familiar looking spacecraft. Asgard itself also looking suspiciously like the capital city of Naboo, Theed. So even though these Dark Elves look quite cool they simply end up as masses of faceless hammer fodder for Thor and his buddies. There is also an uber Dark Elf monster thing that Malekith created with some of the Aether? again visually great with a nice body suit but why didn't Malekith just do this with all his elves or as many as possible? Oh and one minute he's with Malekith after being changed/infected, and the next scene he's captured and in Asgard?! wut?!The script is a complete mess, the film jumps around just like the characters do in the final half of the film. What exactly do the Dark Elves want?? they just wanna errr...destroy the universe? shroud it in darkness?...why exactly? At the start when Portman is sucked into another dimension or something I had no clue what was going on or why she was sucked in. Then there's this Aether stuff...what the hell is that suppose to be? is it a living being? what's its purpose? where does it come from? did anyone make it?. Damn unlucky how Portman's character got zapped straight to where this lethal universe destroying stuff was though huh, wow what are the odds!The action is generic and boring throughout, sorry but it is. The escape from Asgard is typically absurd as Thor manages to pilot a craft he's never stepped foot in before. OK that aspect is joked on by Loki but he still manages to pilot it skillfully evading lots of laser fire and treacherous tight spaces. None of the elves pose any threat to Thor or his mates whatsoever, including a big stone creature. This could quite easily be a lightweight 'Lord of the Rings' spin off frankly, replace elves with orcs, they're both useless against good guys. Most of the fights are pointless as Thor's mates are all invincible yet at the same time Asgardian soldiers seem to be just as useless as the bad guys.You can tell things weren't going as well as hoped because they have stuck Loki back into the fray to try and boost the film. Easily the best character for sure but Jesus Christ you can't rely on this guy every time, I'm amazed the characters are still dumb enough to even trust him sheesh! They actually closed the book with Loki really well in this film but nooooo...couldn't leave it at that, had to have that last twist to spoil it. Continuity wise the film is great no doubt, everyone is back and the story follows on well from the first film. I hope this is the last we see of Portman though as I simply cannot stand her, she has a small range of facial expressions and she uses them over and over. Plus she looked really bored here. Bad guy Eccleston (Hollywood loves a Brit bad guy don't they) had nothing to do and very little to say, great makeup but wasted badly.Sure the film looks delicious with lovely CGI but did you expect it not to? Well I say that but everything falls apart in the London finale, yep the end of the world happens in...Greenwich. The last long long action sequence is the biggest flapping muddle ever, there are characters jumping and falling through portals like no ones business. Weapons and debris flying all over the place and popping up here there and everywhere, the elves look like tacky extras from Doctor Who as they run around the London streets, its all ridiculous.The entire plot is utterly preposterous, it makes no sense half the time and the other half is virtually unexplained. It all hinges on this Aether stuff and the alignment of the nine worlds...aaaand as I type this I'm boring myself. This whole film just feels like filler until the next Avengers outing, nothing more. The action is tepid and bland, half the characters didn't even need to be here as they have little screen time, the Earth based human characters were annoying, the plot is something else and the end of credits scene with Del Toro looked absolutely awful!! Sorely disappointed with this generic effort.4/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good movie though felt held back than letting loose with the scope Thor Universe has.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having mix reactions about the movie, on one hand i loved minor characters like Darcy &amp; her Intern, The Warriors Three were a hoot. In the big league, Loki was awesome as always though his deceptive plot seemed simple than complex which i prefer.Thor was being Thor, while i grow less of a fan of that beard by each passing movie, i do enjoy his dialog delivery. Jane Foster is growing tiresome at least on me, her animated counterpart was better portrayed in Avengers EMH, i guess Natalie Portman can't do much about this one as the cinematic character itself seems to lack scope for development. I really want Marvel to move to Thor &amp; Sif, Sif for the brief period i saw her in Thor tales of Asgard, grew on me quite well.I was looking forward to the Dark Elf but again Thor Tales of Asgard did a better job with Algrim than Dark World with Malekith. Like Man Of Steel the movie can be better experienced in moments than a complete experience, the end credit scene for example just increased my curiosity &amp; some scenes featuring Loki did bring out the best of Thor.I hope the Next Thor movie can build on this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The first real disappointment of the MCU.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am going to skip my usual format and just have an open dialog about this film. I found it incredibly hard to come up with any "The good"s let alone some "The great"s. Simply put, I think this is the first MCU film that I don't like at all.If you read my review for Thor (2011), you will know that I really loved that film. I loved the cast, the humor (in particular the physical comedy), the redemption story, the introduction of Hawkeye, pretty much everything about it. The Dark World trashes everything that was great about the first movie, and I don't even know why.To start, the comedy of the first movie is almost entirely around Thor and how he doesn't understand the world he has been thrust into without his powers. He is hit by cars and subdued by orderlies. He smashes cups and drinks his new found friends under the table. His ego is the joke and we laugh and smile along with him as he finds his feet (and his place) in a new world. In TDW, the jokes are much meaner and, to me at least, far less funny.One of the principal sources of supposed humor in TDW is Dr. Erik Selvig's mental breakdown. We see an absolute shell of the brilliant scientist we saw in Thor. He runs around naked, gives lectures to a group of disinterested mental patients, and takes off his trousers to think. This is funny how? His mind was almost destroyed by being forced to create a device that killed thousands and practically caused the downfall of his own planet. Har Har.Another source of "humor" is Darcy's Intern...cause picking on/abusing people is funny.Unfortunately, the fantastic ensemble cast is entirely wasted. Sif is turned into some sort of love rival and the Warriors Three are turned into mindless, characterless drones who do what Thor tells them, no matter how dumb. Darcy is a joke, a caricature of her character in Thor, and the chemistry between Thor and Jane is as flat as ever.There are so many other problems with this movie. The plot doesn't make sense and relies on so many outrageous coincidences. Death happens too easily and with little real emotional impact. Unnecessary twists happen for no reason. It treats the viewer with such little respect, I could go on for pages.In summary, did not like, won't watch again anytime soon.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The worst Marvel movie so far</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Thor: The Dark World is the worst film Marvel has done in their Cinematic Universe. So far. And it still means that, by any objective standard, it's a good film with plenty of great action, phenomenal visual effects and good actors.It's just that the story is boring. We get to see Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) once again as she continues to unravel the mysteries of the universe with her band of plucky sidekicks. Meanwhile, an old threat awakens to cast a shadow over the peace of Asgard, the Realm Eternal. And thus Jane and Thor (Chris Hemsworth) meet once again to protect the Nine Realms. Sounds exciting? It could have been. Unfortunately, whereas in the first Thor movie we had an extremely interesting and dynamic villain in Loki (Tom Hiddleston), here the villain is about as interesting as watching a cattle drive. It sounds and seems exciting at first, but the monotony settles in very quickly. Malekith (Christopher Eccleston) has no edge, and quite honestly no personality either. He wants to take over the world because... he wants to take over the world. All the Marvel villains before this film had been huge. They were individuals, larger than life, always scheming, plotting, usually with a smirk on their face. This... man... elf... emo band reject, on the other hand, is only distinguished from his troops by the fact that he speaks a bit more and has a snazzier uniform.The rest of the movie is fine. It's not as good as the first Thor, or any of the other Marvel films, but the returning actors are on the top of their game, it's certainly nice to see Jane, Darcy and Erik once again, not to mention Loki - who still absolutely steals every scene he's in - and the visuals works splendidly. It's only that the story cannot be as captivating as it needs to be without an effective villain.Thor: The Dark World is not the first bad Marvel film, the coming of which we fearfully still await and hope to avoid completely, but it is the first Marvel film that can only be described as average on the whole. Which makes it disappointing, but ultimately still worth a watch.</fullReview>

This movie is sucking up to a well-mapped audience which has no care for quality, as long as they get their 10 minutes of something cool to tell their friends about.

		<fullReview>What can I say? Yet another mediocre output from Marvel, sure it's not bad, in fact, it's completely watchable but is that all we demand from blockbusters anymore?Though, that is not to say Thor 2 is without its merits. It's greatest achievement is perhaps it's absolutely flawless production design. I'll congratulate the fellow who could find a single fault within the sets, costumes, make-up and/or CGI and even directing and acting. Moreover there are more than a handful of Grade A action/comedy sequences that truly transcend the film and may I say, are completely kickass.But there are some major things wrong with the film and with a production this flawless, the blame can only fall on one spot... The writing.As a screenwriter myself I got a lot to complain about here, I'll try to keep it short but get ready for a roast...Character development is lacking with no real motivation for the Dark Elves actions and no significant growth in Thor or other characters by the end of the film. The pacing is uneven and sporadic, with way too many breaks for exposition. Which brings me to..Too many things set up and not enough payoffs, ex: whatever happened to the Asian guy in the beginning? I would have loved to see that tie together to something at the end.And lastly, there is a lack of momentum and sense of scale to the story. Instead of a slow build to a giant payoff the movie sort of meanders and wanders. Worst of all , even though apparently the entire universe is on the line it never feels that way. I mean what the hell?! the Dark Elf invasion of earth is like one ship and a few dozen soldiers..End roast.Long story short, Thor 2 is a beautiful film to look at but overall suffers from a script that doesn't do justice to the material. Though, despite the scripts numerous shortcomings it has just enough moments of brilliance to keep you watching all the way through. If you keep your expectations low you'll have a decent time with the movie, just don't expect much.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>And in this movie you will see... everything you have seen many and many times before</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My opinion about this movie will be clearly opposite from the most of the rest viewers. Not because I hate comics, neither because I love them so much that I can't take any deviations in the movies from the printed original versions of the stories. It is because this movie was dull, boring and full of almost painful clichés. If you have seen previous Marvel movies, here you won't find nothing new, except, of course, new villains. A very huge flaw is the plot as it is duplicate of the casual superheroes saving planet Earth movies. There is an exiled great evil - the ark Elf Malekith who lost against Asgardians and for some reason waited eons of years for revenge, his seemingly unbeatable (of course, falling because of cheesy trick at the end of the movie) sidekick for dirty work Kurse, lots of not so clever minions made to be beaten buy the good guys. Most of the movie is about how they have their vengeance and obtain the all-powerful universe destroying weapon Aether. Then there are some good guys who help hero just before the culmination of the action, over concerned father Odin, a hated traitor Loki who, of course, sacrifices at the time of need, a hero's girlfriend Jane Foster who is to be saved. And naturally almighty hero Thor who suffers from personal life problems. In this movie they even have a demented scientist and incapable of performing everyday cares Jane's friends but who also happen to be extremely helpful than the Earth is attacked by super powerful evil entity. The villains to destroy the universe yet again will have to attack the poor Earth where they lose (though after winning in Asgard against gods). Despite all this sarcasm I can say that the last scene of the movie was great and was the only part not according to the usual superhero film script plan. By the way, there is additional extra scene just after the credits... Acting, in my opinion, was average. It could be because of the fact that in such type of movies there are only few characters who have development. Cast was good but exceptional performances were made by those who played the bad guys - Christopher Eccleston (Malekith) and, Tom Hiddleston as Loki. Chris Hemsworth is probably the best possible actor as Thor. Others, however, did not shine so bright. Even Academy Awards winners Anthony Hopkins and Natalie Portman did not looked so perfect as they always do. Most people enjoy screening of comic book based movies because greatly executed special effects and entertaining fight scenes, especially if it is in 3D. More than a half of movie consists action scenes, so you will get both heaped. However, fight scenes are boring and predictable since you can tell before even they start whose time has come to lose and die. Fight scenes look messy although both inventive as creators mash up medieval, modern warfare and Star Wars like weaponry at the same time. Landscapes seem much improved form Thor 1. Soundtrack and cinematography? There reason why people usually don't talk about them in comic book based movies... There are a lot of jokes, some of which are cheesy one liners and some are fairly descent. This slows down the tension. In overall it is not a bad movie. Had great potential with strong cast, great visual effects, great director Alan Taylor and astronomical budget. However, its predictability, lack of creativity and clichés kill the interest in the movie for those who are not Marvel movie fans.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not directed by Kenneth Branagh, "Thor: The Dark World", seems to suffer for it. The problem which really made the movie turgid was awful over- usage of of sitcom 1-liner humor trying to play off as wit. Rather there at least a dozen "joke" lines that are feeble, unimaginative, and make you wonder if you're watching a super-hero movie or a Thursday night made-for- TV outing. I don't understand how this kind of script gets green-lit, devoid of intelligence or editing. The other issue for me is the dull yacking of characters for about the first 30 min of the movie - GET ON WITH IT filmmakers - stop trying to describe a movie through dialog - show it happening! Looking past these, the movie starts to take off finally for the 2nd 2/3 of runtime. It does not have the focus, soundtrack, wit, and direction of it's predecessor. Give it about a 6.5/10 closer to a 6 maybe. Could've been much better.</fullReview>

It has some better references to Star Wars (lasers, sounds), Star Trek (cloaking device) and Chronicles of Riddick (ships, SFX effects). It is all that a movie of this genre should be in the first place (and, for example, Green Lantern was not): an illusion of reality that entertains. No morals, no subtle messages. Plain simple, yet intelligent, script, fun, action (with destruction, of course), very good acting (considering the "circumstances"; the casting was excellent), direction, editing and music. SFX is really superb and very convincing. This movie sort of sucks you in, relieving you of all the bad mood or frustrations you had before watching it. It delivers. It makes you sleep well afterward. Highly recommended for those moments when you need something to make you feel - "this was made for me". Now grab what you usually do before a (really) good movie and watch it. And have fun. People that made this movie did it for you, not just themselves :)</fullReview>

There are a constant stream of cheesy one-liners and occasionally one manages to be funny.Thor and Loki are well played as usual, but Portman's character is just annoying and uneven.

		<fullReview>These Marvel movies just keep getting better. The one, and only thing I noticed though is the lack of cross over tie in product placement that we have been seeing from the other movies in the franchise. Sure there are a couple of mentions, and a few guest cameos, but there were no logos, not a bad thing actually, I am bringing this up because I think it is a good factor that makes this a better movie. You are not given a movie that is just a walking toy ad like Transformers movies are, or that last The Wolverine&#xfeff; movie(which was good, but the cross-branding was just too much I think). I really Enjoyed this movie even though three stops in the tube would have taken more then the 6 or so minutes that Thor was expected to be keeping Malekith busy. Or the fact that they all have to walk, or run across the Rainbow bridge, which should take a week the thing is so long. However you don't need me to recommend this movie, you will see it, and you will get a great ride out of it, that you can count on.</fullReview>

The story, villain, and connectivity to The Avengers is laughable and the cliché humanoid 60's Star Trek aliens take you out of the movie. This should have been a home run but it's quite disappointing if looking at it objectively and not as a drooling Avengers fanboy.

All of these were delivered. Surprisingly the acting was not too bad at all in places, although the Darcy Lewis character is one of the most irritating that I have had the misfortune to experience on screen.There was some confusion early on as there were references made to events that weren't in the first film, so I must have missed another Thor film at some point, but I can only find one other on IMDb. This also detracted from my enjoyment.In a nutshell, after a promising start, the film nose-dived considerably, but then managed to claw its way back up from being "awful" to simply being "mediocre". As brainless sequels go this was a reasonable effort, but I won't bother watching it when it is eventually on the telly.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not So Epic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Out of all the heroes, my favorite is Thor simply because I love the dynamic between him and his brother and because its set in Asgard (which is ten times more awesome than Earth). Plus, this movie I was incredibly excited for just for the simple fact that Alan Taylor was directing it, the same director who did the most awesome Game of Thrones episodes.Now, on to the actual review. Was this the best movie I've ever seen? No. It really wasn't, it had some humor but not as much as Iron Man 3, had some good action but not as great as say, Game of Thrones and Jane Foster was more irritating than in the first movie. The start of the movie greatly mirrored the start of the first movie which began to irritate me already, why copy what was already done and not that great? I loved the chemistry between Thor, Sif and the Warrior's Three and was sorely disappointed that they didn't get shown more. Loki's scenes were incredibly interesting though they once again, like in the first film, didn't emphasize on the relationship. They hinted that Loki was close to Frigga, had learned magic from her but it was nothing really detailed.Odin was a dick, extremely so. Jane, as I said, was annoying. Thor was good but he could have gone so much farther. His and Loki's scenes were the best out of the whole movie but they were short and ended so abruptly. I wish that this movie would have gone more into the entire relationship of the royal family, to show the bond and the broken pieces instead of just brushing against it. It bothered me the potential and it just wasn't met. Malekith was just not, that great of a villain. He sort of fell flat and that too irritated me because he had the potential for a cool story.Now don't get me wrong, the movie is fantastic. It really is great, good action, great chemistry, awesome special effects (except at the very end) but there was just the potential for?more. So much more. I would have loved it if the Aether had taken over and controlled Jane. Would have loved for a little bit more Thor and Loki, more royal family, more of Sif and the Warrior's Three. Just more. Less elves and Jane, more Asgard. The twist at the end was fantastic but again, I wish that they would have explained like why Loki kept saying sorry when he "died". We can all guess but I would like a for sure answer. Did he mean it or not? What happened to Odin? Obviously Sif and the Warrior's Three didn't suffer that bad of a punishment (after credits scene alert) but why? Loki hates them along with Thor (maybe), so why spare them? AND WHY COULDN'T HE KILL JANE? PLEASE GET RID OF HER!The after credits scene was awesome, I couldn't help but squeal at such a strong hint at Guardians of the Galaxy. Ah! So exciting.All in all, good movie just a little disappointing but totally worth seeing especially for the Captain America cameo. Ugh, best part if the whole movie (and it was between Thor and Loki! Imagine that).</fullReview>

Its was nice to learn a little more of the back story of Asgard but it was the Asgardian acting that made the film particularly bad.Lots of people are talking about how the anti-hero of the story, Loki, is this total rebel bad-ass and compare him to other beloved villains like Heath Ledge's Joker but not so.

Firstly I'd like to say that I enjoyed most of the film. The Dark Elves looked quality with their Armour and masks etc. Thor was good. Loki was better. Special effects were great. Fighting and action scenes were a good example of how to show action without the use of shaky cam, which is far too common in "family Friendly" action films these days. The main issue I had with the film was the humour. It was way out of balance. In particular, Dennings' character. I didn't care about her. In the first film they had a great balance with the seriousness, action and humour. Dennings was in the background and said the odd dopey thing, but in this film they really shoved her silliness down your throat and ramped up the jokes which ruined the balance of the film. She had way too much air time for a character irrelevant to the story. Hiddleston Was great as always. Rene Russo looked like a bad-ass with her blade.Anthony Hopkins was....Anthony HopkinsThor's friends weren't in it enough.Thor has some issues for wanting to be with Portman over Jaimie Alexander.

		<shortDescription>Action hero movie, emphasis on the ACTION</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In this movie, there is way more action than plot. It appears that the director/writer was focused on making the movie "exciting" first, then coming up with some plot devices to fit in with it. The "Aether" is particularly uninspired as a choice for the big bad. It's an excuse to skip writing any characterization for the antagonist; ("Hey, it's just an evil entity that's silent and just sort of.. there. Yay! Less work for us!"). (SPOILER) My biggest complaint with the movie (and this bugged the heck out of me) is the completely out-of-place spaceships and fighters (Think x-wings like Star Wars. Yes, really.) Asgard is supposed to be a realm out of myth. There is a reason everyone gets around using the bi-frost, isn't there? If everyone has spaceships, why were we told in the first Thor movie that the destruction of the bi-frost prevented transportation to other realms? And if these people have guns, why do all the characters on Asgard fight with swords/clubs/daggers? I'm trying to get over my annoyance about this ill-advised overlap with sci-fi. Not having any luck with that. The movie is entertaining, though, in the same way that mindless summer blockbusters are. This would have fit right in with summer releases. Some nice in-jokes for Marvel fans. Now for the actors:Natalie Portman is pretty boring. She doesn't have much to do except swoon, really. Chris Hemsworth does a good job; in my opinion there are limits to what you can do with Thor as he's written in these movies. A bad actor could make a disaster of it; a good actor can make it just fine. There's not much room for an actor to show off his craft. Anthony Hopkins is never bad, but both he and Rene Russo are just sort of there to occupy roles that have to be filled. Very one-dimensional, but then again, that's not out of the ordinary for superhero movies in general. The best part of the movie?? TOM HIDDLESTON. The dude wears Loki like a second skin now. He steals every scene he's in. The character of Loki would, in anyone else's hands, be as simple and one-dimensional as all the other characters in the movie. Instead, he brings subtlety to a role that could easily be reduced to scenery-chewing. He's a master at the grin that conveys, all at once, the mischief of a little boy, the evil of a true villain and a bit of the resentment of the orphaned and overlooked son. I found myself paying much more attention anytime he was on screen just because I find his portrayal to be bordering on the sublime. 6 out of 10 overall, because of the (gag) spaceships and the lack of any suspense for the audience.</fullReview>

This is when all planets in the nine realms are perfectly aligned and thus easier for Malekith to use the aether to darkify all worlds at once. He loses and is forced to flee and put himself and his surviving people into stasis until the aether is accidentally found once again by a certain brown-haired scientist. Cue Thor and the problems this brings to his world and family.Mal and Argrim/Kurse- Neither character has any real depth. The director said that unfortunately most of it was left on the cutting room floor. However, even though kurse does most of the brute strength work in the movie, and Mal really doesn't get to do anything groundbreaking until the final battle, both are deliciously intimidating and menacing. Basically they are everything Loki failed to be in two movies. Good villains. They lack strong characterization but they both got the job done. Their actors worked with what they had and they did it beautifully. Also of special mention is the dark elf language. It was made especially for this movie and sounds deliciously demonic.When the aether is awoken again Thor is forced to team up with his deeply untrustworthy adopted brother Loki, and his shallow as a kiddle pool love interest Jane Foster. He is more mature here, but also still very likable. Movie hit its stride when Thor and Loki are together. Great chemistry. Their screen-time together is unfortunately all to brief. Gotta get back to what's important Jane's posse and their'funny' earth scenes.Jane- she serves three unfortunate purposes and they are the plot device to get Thor to earth, his depthless love interest, and a damsel in the distress. Seriously she literally spends the second half of the film knocked out, has no speaking lines with Loki after the infamous slap, and barely any lines of note with Thor either for that matter. She does get to be of use in the final battle, but it's a little too late. Foster (and friends) needs to be written out of the story someday soon.Loki-I liked the character yet again and he is the sole reason I went to the theater to see this. I saw Thor and the Avengers on Netflix. He has such a strong presence that the screen feels empty when he isn't on it. His overall characterization and agency felt more at home here. Like this is the real continuation of Loki from Thor 1 instead of that pathetic comedic mess he was written as in the Avengers. This movie just proved to me yet again that Loki is treated better as a character in the Thor movies.Acting overall was good.I loved the ending credit artwork.No love triangle crap. Asgard was beautiful. It looked more lived in here. Music was decent, but scenes go by so quickly that you really can't appreciate it. You will actually have to youtube if you actually want to listen to it.Fanservice pandering is very evident here to the detriment of overall characterization. Will become very apparent what I mean by this after the movie is watched.Comedy- overall execution is the problem. Sad things happen in this movie and yet I didn't care. Couldn't care. A lot of the comedic points were strongly misplaced.This leads me to my biggest problem there was a severe lack of emotional impact. The somber scenes just flew past while the earth and funny got to keep on strutting. Transitions from melancholy to earth/funny were off big time. We aren't given time to linger and soak in what just happened and the characters aren't either. More time should have been spent on the emotional scenes and less on the latter.Earth- more tolerable then the first one, but overall still the most boring part of the Thor movies. If they can't (or won't) get rid of earth, at least in his movies, then please tone it down. Just like the first film the most exciting and character driven scenes happened on Asgard and the other worlds. Leave earth for the avenger team-ups. It's not the runtime it's what you do with it that matters. We stayed on earth with its meh characters and comedic moments to long, and the emotional parts suffered greatly for it.The overall dialogue was off. It was clunky in parts and cheesy. I definitely preferred the first movie.Two credit scenes - The mid is foreshadowing a movie to come and it's an atrocious looking scene. It looked like it came from the worst of the sci-fi channel. Even the director has gone on record despising it. It was filmed by someone else. If this is a hint to what this future movie will look, and play, like then I sense marvels first bomb. End credit was meh to.Disney's cheesy stamp is all over this. You can tell Marvel /Disney had their hands too far in the cookie jar in this one. To the point the director is asking fans to petition for a director's cut so we can get the serious, emotional movie he wanted instead of this big budget action comedy. I will never understand how they seem to know that the family drama is where the juicy meat is, and yet they keep giving us large doses of earth characters and their 'funny' moments. It's like since the Avengers has made this a shared universe Thor can't be the high fantasy drama it could and should be. Overall this movie did the visuals and action better than the first, but it missed the boat on the most important thing to me. A soul.</fullReview>

Acting is well done, directing any everything is pretty good... the plot, oh the plot !!1.- Predictable. 2.- Villains that nobody cares about. 3.- Love and kisses in the middle of catastrophes. 4.- you will forget everything about this movie in less than 2 hours. 5.- OverratedThis is why movies are crap, cause they only want to see a character (loki) in action instead of getting a good story.I don't know why the writers think if they put some science to movies its going to be a good movie.Is not as good as they say, not as bad as you think. Watch it? yes, just wait till its free on TV. Meanwhile go and watch something else.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Where's Thor?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>**SPOILER ALERT**Full of action, humorous, and an overall fun film with one major flaw; "Thor" is nowhere to be found, replaced by an entity that amounts to little more than a big guy with a hammer.The Thor faithful, especially those that followed Walt Simonson's adaptation of Snorri Sturlusen's stories in the prose and poetic Edda, will more than likely be disappointed in what Marvel has done to their hero. Gone is the super-being that travels faster than the speed of light, gone is the mightiest entity in the nine realms, replaced by something that is "Thor" in name alone. The "Thor" we find in "Dark World" suffers from many of the same weaknesses and limitations that humans do, leaving us wondering, and asking ourselves; just what is so special about this character? In the eyes of this ancient fan that did, indeed, follow the saga described above, not much - not much at all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Thor: The Dark World made a wise choice of stepping up to its sequel. It tends to explore worlds beyond Asgard and Midgard, and innovating more details around this absurd universe. Because if your source material have a world this rich, it makes your everyday reality look boring. It's a fine escapism, but the joy stumbles when it goes to the storyline. It's almost like the opposite of the first movie. Here, it works better when it simply shows the heroes fighting off the bad guys, but feels forced when it tries to pull off a drama. The overall film can be entertaining, but it messes a lot of elements within the surfaces.The big problem already lies by justifying the word "dark" in the title. While being dark and serious is not really a problem to this modern era of blockbusters, the film never felt natural for it. Though, the first movie was more special when it was focused on the drama, here it definitely feels force. There are those "tragic" or "emotional" scenes when it feels so contrived for the sake of fitting and pleasing the audience who seek for sheer deepness. The result is surprisingly not compelling, which makes you wish it was handled by Kenneth Branagh again. The film also suffers with a weak plot, there are large parts where the good guys are lingering to brood, making plans, and just goofing around while they're surrounded by a formidable enemy. Those moments they waste pretty much kills the momentum.The movie is better when it stays loyal to the roots of a Marvel picture. Staying in the action and the comedy is when the film felt more comfortable, although it may get out of hand. The cast gives plenty of life, as always, especially when Tom Hiddleston is around to spice things up. Director Alan Taylor seems to be more interested in creating inventive action set pieces and featuring stuff that we don't normally see in the genre, which helps a lot to bring pure energy within the adventure, while the CGI effects bring massive scale in any world they stop in to.Thor: The Dark World had its fun moments, but also suffers by its missteps. The recent trend of "darkening" almost every latest superhero movie somewhat affects it. Having drama scenes is definitely not the problem since the first movie was fascinating because of those parts. The real problem is how the film delivers them, it instead makes them look preachy and pretentious. It would have been a straightforward quest, because that's where the film works better. If the whole film is completely adventurous and full of personality, then it might end up being somehow remarkable. Still, Thor needs some pizazz to its gravity to make it more than just another action blockbuster. For now, Thor: The Dark World is fine enough as a distraction.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie was more comical than I expected, in a very good way. I just love when Thor comes to earth and I just loved Loki's sarcasm in this move. He nearly became my favourite character. And I also love how parts of different sequels are all linked and connected. Makes me feel like I am watching a huge TV show, only that is in movie parts and extremely better done. Oh was I glad that someone (Jane herself) actually mentioned how all that was Jane's fault. I was starting to get frustrated how no one was bringing that up. It was like a huge elephant in the room and I just couldn't bear. The real-life lessons: didn't find many instances that made me think that that could be a useful lesson in real life. Plausibility: at the beginning I was thinking that it is totally impossible that from everyone in the plant Jane was the one that found the Aether, but I was happy that the movie justified this by giving a believable explanation- she found it because she was looking for Thor and following the signals by having some of the most advanced devices and not to forget the anomalies that made this all possible since all the worlds aligned. So logically, no one was looking harder and with more advanced equipment then Jane so the odds of her being the one finding it were pretty good. Character development: I liked how Loki's character stayed true. He helped Thor but he still had his own agenda. Not the totally bed guy with greed and ambition that can't let him be called honours and good. Storytelling: this is where I didn't like the movie so much. The story got a bit boring and was moving slow and you could expect the ending. You thought that Thor's plan would succeed and he alone would be the one to bring an end to it all and that's exactly what happens. No twists. I think Loki's survival was supposed to be a surprise but somehow that was also expect able. It would have been more interesting if he actually died (even tough I'd hate that).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Low Key (Loki) Entry</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Thor: The Dark World picks on Asgard at some point after the events of The Avengers. The Tesseract is safe. Thor has the good graces of Odin. Heimdall watches over a repaired Bifrost. Most importantly, Loki faces charges for his crimes on Earth. Lurking, however, is Malekith and his Dark Elves who wish to unleash the power of the Aether on the Nine Realms and return the universe to darkness.Overall, I don't really care about any of this stuff, save for one exception (more on that later). Thor: The Dark World struggles to improve on one of my biggest complaints of the first film; the nature of Odin's power and the Asgardians' immortality. The rules of the Eternal Realm seem too fast, loose, convenient, and underdeveloped for me to feel engaged, and once again, Odin comes across more as Mad King Ludwig than the Allfather.The new additions of Malekith and the Aether seem unconvincing as well, in that the former lacks screen presence and the latter doesn't really differentiate itself from the Tesseract. In the end, deus ex machina and weirdly times jokes rule the day and seems to answer any questions the viewer may have, or even distract one from them.Despite my complaints, Tom Hiddleston nearly puts on a one-man show as Loki, and delivers the best of his three performances in the MCU. Chris Hemsworth does a serviceable job as Thor as well, but Hiddleston certainly stands out and almost does enough to allow me to give this film a solid recommendation. 2.5 out of 4 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, this one was a long time coming. Somehow I missed this completely in 2013, and so it was inevitable that I got to it. The first Thor was never my favourite, less because of the quality of the film and more because I've never really connected with, or been super interested in Thor as a character.Backstory aside, I was pleasantly surprised by The Dark World. Hemsworth is a charming and charismatic presence, and Tom Hiddleston has such a strong screen presence that it's pretty easy to get through on the two alone. That, coupled with the (almost) unrecognizable Christopher Eccleston (Doctor Who) as Malekith give enough to like in the performances to recommend this one.Honestly, the track record that Marvel studios has for creating entertaining, and quality films is something that almost seems completely unbelievable. At their worst, the movies they put out are thoroughly entertaining, and this entry is far from the worst.One of the most interesting parts of the movie come in the visuals; particularly in the design of the dark elves, and the other realms. There are some really interesting fantasy elements in the movie that almost felt like they could have been Guillermo del Toro designs. There's some of the most interesting visuals and creature design present in this movie that the rest of the MCU just hasn't come close to yet.While it might be easy to doubt this one, especially after director Alan Taylor's most recent work Terminator Genysis, but all in all, Thor: The Dark World is a fun, entertaining ride that offers some solid performance and visuals. It managed to get me excited for the upcoming Thor film, so I guess that's something.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Less Thor, more Loki please!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I preferred this to the first Thor movie. It is predominantly set in the lands of the gods rather than on Earth -which means more scope for SciFi/magical cityscapes, weird spaceships and bad guys.Thor himself, played by Chris Hemsworth, is actually a bit dull. In the first movie he goes through a character development from an insolent young adult to a responsible king-in- waiting. In The Dark World he's just regal, sensible and boring.But don't dismay! The character of Loki is developed very nicely in this movie and he steals the show. Loki is the double- crossing trickster of the gods and much more interesting than the one-dimensional characters surrounding him. Tom Hiddleston is well-cast in this role.The bad guys, the Dark Elves, are excellent too. They're truly frightening creatures (for a 12-rated film). Full marks to the make-up artists I think. There's some great battle scenes between the Dark Elves and the Asgardians.All in all this isn't a masterpiece but it's entertaining viewing throughout.(And it's surely just a matter of time before a Loki spin-off movie comes our way!)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Thor has to stop the evil dark elves from getting the energy that Jane has accidentally hosted in her body in order to prevent them from turning the world into darkness. The second Thor movie isn't like the first one, but it is entertaining. Two things that bothered me: -you have to have watched the avengers before you watch the movie. Fortunatelly I did, but for someone who hasn't, it will be annoying as they are brought up frequently and some of parts of the story are connected to the avengers movie, like Loki's imprisonment. -the first part of the movie is a little shaky, as the plot tries to get to the point. So we have Jane in London, waiting for Thor to come and Thor trying to find a way to go back to her. In other ways the movie is quite entertaining and enjoyable. I even started to like Loki, but the end kind of spoiled that. That said the plot was a little complicated but I guess it wasn't that bad. So I give Thor a 6 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Flawed , yet reasonably fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In theory Thor: The Dark World is a great movie. In this theory it's a great sci-fi epic about beings that look like viking gods. In practice though it is not a great movie as much as it is a deeply flawed movie with some very nice individual scenes in it.The biggest problem T:tDW has is, that it is a Marvel movie and just like very other Marvel movie it does its best to make the viewers remember that they are in fact watching a Marvel movie. This leads into nudges and winks towards the other movies in Marvel's arsenal, which in this case make the movie feel a bit disjointed as it assumes that the viewer has already seen those. It also means that the characters don't really get that much flesh in their stories as the writing clearly seems to assume that someone else is going to flesh out the characters more in somewhere else. That's why the movie is filled with familiar faces whom a casual viewers might have very hard time identifying with, as they have no inkling who those many faces are and what is their significance.TtDW is a fun movie none the less. It is more or less forgettable sequel to a relatively forgettable movie in the first place, but just like the first movie it is reasonably well done to fill its purpose of entertainment. Sadly though it could have been so much more, but in the end that wasn't in the cards.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After seeing the first Thor movie, I wasn't sure how I would like this film because the first film had completely blown my mind, so I thought that Thor: The Dark World wasn't going to be as good. Clearly, that wasn't the case because I found Thor: The Dark World to be an action-packed thrill ride with a lot of humor and even a little bit of heart thrown in for good measure.The film opens with Odin telling us about The Dark Elves and their leader, Malekith who seeks to plunge the universe into everlasting darkness by using a weapon called the Aether, but before he can carry out his plan, Odin's father, Bor, invades the Elves' home world, takes the Ather and seals it in a stone column. We then cut to the present day where Loki is thrown in jail for his war crimes in The Avengers, while Thor is busy cleaning up the mess his half-brother has cased. Meanwhile, Dr. Jane Foster is transported to another world and is processed by the Aether, spending Thor to come to Earth for Jane, while Malekith has sensed the Aether and comes to Asgard looking for it, and Thor now must protect Jane and The Aether from him.The change in directors provides a nice change of pace with Alan Taylor replacing Kenneth Branagh and typically, a change in directors proves to be a severe disadvantage to the movie, but not in this case. Taylor gives this film a feeling of depth and a much more epic size and scoop to it than the first film had and made it much more darker, but at the same time, more humorous.The visuals are stunning, the production design is top notch and Asgard just looks beautiful, plus we get to see explore of it in the movie. While the first Thor movie had action in it, there wasn't enough of it to keep me satisfied but thankfully, Thor: The Dark World has a lot more action and I got to see more of Thor fighting which is always awesome to see. Two stand-out action scenes are the battle on Vanaheim and the showdown between Thor and Malekith. The humor makes this movie much more relevant even to people who aren't fans of Thor and it is just hilarious like when Loki, Thor, and Jane are flying a spaceship out of Asgard and Thor is constantly crashing into things.It was also good to see more of Thor and Loki's relationship in this movie and the interactions between them is done so well, particularly when Loki is stabbed and Thor is cradling him in his arms, you can just feel all the emotion in that scene.As with all the Marvel films that I've seen already, the cast in Thor: The Dark World hit the mark and seem to wear their roles like a well-made outfit: It's pretty clear that Chris Hemsworth has really matured into the character of Thor and much like Robert Downey Jr. always being Iron Man or Chris Evans always being Captain America, Hemsworth is and will always be Thor, no questions asked. Tom Hiddleson once again brings his A game when playing Loki, capturing all the craftiness, all the egotism, and all the anguish of someone powerless to carry the burden of his ego with just a glimmer in his eye and the way Tom plays the god of mischief is oddly fascinating. You can see that he's completely wicked and not to be trusted, yet at the same time, you can't help but like him. Natalie Portman returns as Dr. Jane Foster and is just as charming and attractive as he was in the first movie and the chemistry between her and Hemsworth just radiates whenever they are together on screen. Renee Russo gets to have more screen time in this film as Frigga and puts in a pretty solid performance. Anthony Hopkins is and will always be Odin and plays the role perfectly in this movie, playing the old knowledgeable father, but at the same time, being serious when need be. Jamie Alexander, Zachary Levi, Ray Stevenson and Tadanobu Asano are all good in their roles. Christopher Eccleston is effective as Malekith, but I felt that he was overshadowed in this film by Loki. I never liked Kat Dennings as Darcy in the first film and I still found her to be really annoying in this film and Stellen Skarsgard acts a little too crazy in this film, but it really didn't bug me a whole lot.The only other issue I had with this film was some of the humor felt out of place and didn't make me laugh, but on the whole, I liked Thor: The Dark World just as much as the first one. It improved on a couple of things from the first film and added a much darker story. Throw in some great action scenes, some nice romantic moments, awesome visuals and great performances and you have one great superhero film. I would recommend this to any Marvel fan or DC fan or anyone who likes comic book films. Be sure to stick around for not one, but two mid-credit scenes at the end of the movie.</fullReview>

Odin is helpful in explaining what are the infinity stones and who are the dark elves. but hold on a second what happened to Odin. Loki's now on the thrown of Asgard and lucky for him hemdal hasn't alerted Thor who is now living on earth with Jane. the collector also makes a post credit appearance and so does Adam warlock in his cocoon. the collector wants the infinity stones so that thanos wont destroy the universe and all the interesting life. it confused me until i saw it the second time and saw how great this movie is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Chris Hemsworth can't act, but I thought this feature film was okay regardless.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Disclaimer: This feature film was pretty decent, and the review below will state why. I rated this feature film 7/10 stars because of the following, and the feature films lead actor not being as talented as one should be to be a feature films lead.I enjoyed the Thor movie, and am proud of myself for watching it due to me typically not liking movies with male leads who seemed like they were hired based off of their alleged appearance versus acting skills/ability -- For example: If Thor is supposed to be a massive god then the person hired to play him may have more looks than acting ability on his side and get the part/movie studios are deliberately looking for that.Chris Hemsworth cannot act that well in my opinion, so I will say I was disappointed when it came to that. The movies visuals, plot, other actors, all of their costumes, and ability to keep one like myself paying attention for the length of the movie was way better than his acting. As a result I found myself happy about the film.As far as the visuals go, Asgard was dipped in gold and visually stunning. The movies costumes for the people of Asgard, Thor, the Dark Elves, and a monster called "Kursed" were eye catching and cool to look at for the entirety of the film. The stories plot was very easy to digest, and I enjoyed it's simplicity allowing most viewers to follow its story line smoothly.The film has to deal with "Dark Elves" wanting to obtain and use something called "Aether", to turn the universe into the "darkness" it was before it existed/destroy the universe as we know it for all of eternity --allowing them to reign supreme over it once again, as they did before the birth of the universe as we know it now/as it's portrayed in the film. Thor is lured to the movies conflict due to the "Aether" hosting itself in Jane Fosters --his mortal love interest-- body during an early point in the movie, and through time learns of the power of it and the cataclysmic results of it getting in the wrong hands. His goal is to prevent the antagonist of the film --Malekith, the main Dark Elf focused on-- from going forward with his cataclysmic plans.All of that is very simple to understand, and for kids, teens, and adults that's something that makes the movie easy for them all to enjoy and experience while being on the same page.With all of those things being said and touched on, I recommend this movie as being one worth seeing on your own time. It was decent enough to me for me to say that. Enjoy, if you decide to view it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes, It's unintentionally funny, stupid and overly long. Both "Superman Returns" and "Man of Steel" have more merit, and that's stretching things! Watch it for the two hot girls and pumped up Chris. Watch it for the over-the-top computer graphics. Check your brain at the door. I didn't even enjoy "Guardians of the Universe" that much. I guess I am having SFX overload. Think of how much better even Superman III-IV could have been with all these mindless explosions! I was tired after watching the first hour of this mess. Everything in the last half was totally predictable. Where did "Papa Thor" go? Back to the Smurfs? I thought I was watching "Independence Day 2" for a while. You must watch the "Easter Eggs" between the 10 minute credits. Mind-numbing and stupid but great for adolescent boys who like "manly" women, "WWE" and all that stuff. Very redundant to the first Thor. Verdict: Thor 2 made my head sore!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's dark alright but not in a good way.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The rating on IMDb is misleading. The movie is average 5/10 at best. The plot of the movie is that Thor must fight the dark elves who use ether as some sort of weapon. The acting is okay. Chris Hemsworth, Natalie Portman, Anthony Hopkins were competent in their roles. The standout was Tom Hiddleston who played Loki. Kat Dennings of Two Broke Girls fame plays the intern is there for the comic relief. However as other users have mentioned, the humour is not funny but rather irritating. She too has an intern and he comes off as an idiot and not in a funny way. This movie has some amazing special effects and scenery, however unless the plot is of good standard, special effects can only carry it so far. The action scenes with Thor are bloodless thanks to a pg13 rating and are not that great. This movie is worth a hire or wait for it to come on free to air TV.Jackal75</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Worthy Sequel!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Thor: The Dark World, the sequel to the 2011 film and sort-of-spin off from 2012's The Avengers, is quite a spectacle. Thor isn't my favorite character from the Marvel universe, as I feel Captain America and Iron Man have better character arches, but Thor does have his moments. This film retained the well-liked humor from the first film and added more set pieces to the film to its advantage. The special effects are great and we are still treated to the visual beauty of Asgard. The only part of the film I felt was weak was the forced romance between Thor and Jane. But luckily for the rating, I didn't care too much.Alan Taylor, taking over from Kenneth Branagh in the director's chair, directs a film regarding Thor in the aftermath of New York. In this particular film, Thor must team up with his brother and nemesis Loki to stop the Dark Elves who are led by the malicious Malekith from plunging the world into darkness and once again saving Earth and the Nine Realms.Like many Marvel films, the film has an incredible array of actors and actresses working on the film. Chris Hemsworth as Thor is mighty as ever. Tom Hiddleston provides some of the best humor with his witty dialogue as Loki. Natalie Portman is okay as Jane, but I felt her romance with Thor was forced and unrealistic. Stellan Skarsgaard makes a welcome return and my favorite scene involves him at Stonehenge acting quite weird. Christopher Eccleston actually makes for a solid villain. Finally, we get some brief, but effective supporting turns from Anthony Hopkins, Idris Elba, and Rene Russo.Overall, the Thor sequel pushes up the stakes even more as Thor and Loki must try to the save the universe yet again. I loved the humor, willingly provided by Loki. I also loved how the film is action-packed without sacrificing anything for the story. Towards the end, we have a great action scene involving the travel between many worlds, so that was quite fascinating to watch. The visual effects are also impressive as well. This is an incredible sequel, about on par with the first film. There are also several scenes to keep an eye out for in the post-credits. I rate this film 9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great movie to watch to the fans of Mega-Marvel franchise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Initial parts were not that interesting. But the story progressed in a very good way towards the end. The mega-franchise sequels is getting interesting with each of the movies. Hope for more superb sequels for this one as this as a cliff-hanger on the mid-credit bonus scene at the end which will keep the audience intrigued to watch the next sequel very eagerly.The first Thor movie was not that good according to me as it looked like, along with Captain America, was done in preparation for the The Avengers Assemble movie. But this movie story moves independently continuing from that movie with only references to it.On the whole a great movie to watch to the fans of Mega-Marvel franchise. (And also its comic book readers I guess since I would not know whether they would like it as I don't read those comics myself.)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film overall has it's fair share of holy s**t moments that defy all levels of credibility, even for a comic book/sci-fi/fantasy movie. That whole business about the Aether winding up in Natalie Portman's body was just a little too much to wrap my head around, especially after it was assured that the heroes of Asgard buried it so deeply to avoid detection by the Dark Elves.Probably the best way to approach this film is to just sit back and get transported between the realms of Earth and Asgard without thinking too much about it. As an actioner there's plenty of it. As a story, there's just too much going on with events seemingly occurring because they were written that way instead of there being a rationale for them. I mean, one minute Thor's hand is cut off and then it's back again - wait a minute, what!? And with the emphasis on the Dark Elves I found a lot of Asgard suspiciously resembling places seen before in Rivendell. If there's going to be a Thor III, maybe a little more thought needs to go into it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A lesser entry in the Marvel Cinematic Universe</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While it still mostly on par with the first THOR, this sequel feels bigger while also losing a lot of the human connection which made the previous one enjoyable. There are some fleeting moments of humor, but there's also a lot of gloom and doom. In THOR: THE DARK WORLD, Thor has to save the universe (Avengers anyone?) from Malekith and the Aether. Sure, there's some half-baked scientific explanation for all of it but the end result is a little disappointing. Malekith was a cool-looking villain, but not very engaging or charismatic. There were also a few too many narrative conveniences, a couple involving Loki's ability to impersonate other people. Nevertheless, it was entertaining and kind of what I've come to expect from Marvel. The acting is very good, as is the action and visual effects. I still don't buy Natalie Portman as a scientist, but oh well. This isn't Marvel's best, but Phase 2 is going pretty good so far. If you've liked Marvel's previous entries, you should like this one too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An improvement on the first, a fantastical return to Asgard</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Most importantly, The Dark World felt like a post-Avengers story, both plot-wise and in the characters' arcs, whereas Iron Man 3 felt like it could have been told before the Avengers with little difference. Hemsworth again vanishes into his role, and Hiddleston is as slimy as ever. The humor was probably some of the sharpest and least forced of all Marvel's movies so far, with everyone really upping their game. I loved the change from Shakespearean drama to Lord of the Rings-style fantasy; it really allowed for some epic locations and battles, while overall showcasing some new sides to Asgard and the universe in general. The use of various color palettes was genius, changing from greys to greens to oranges and browns really differentiated the worlds and tones. The plot mechanisms also gave way to some of the most inventive and thrilling battle sequences I've seen. If Man of Steel dragged a bit for you in the battles, you'll probably feel the opposite here. In fact, the entire film clips along briskly and could stand an extended cut. I was just sad when it ended; I wanted more. Some clever twists and turns kept me completely invested in the characters and story. Unfortunately, an undeveloped villain left a lot to be desired, and prevents it from ranking as Marvel's best for me. But for sheer exhilaration, it parallels Marvel's The Avengers and Man of Steel, earning bonus points for the change to outright fantasy genre Thor belongs in, as well as some brilliant tie-ins to Viking culture. There were also some very appreciated nods to the first film, and a scene that will take you so off guard you'll need the movie to pause just to recover - in a good way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Glorious and Gloriously Preposterous,"Thor: The Dark World" Makes Armageddon Both Dire and Fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Successful depictions of mythological tales embrace both their grandeur and bizarre but entertaining illogic. Marvel Comics' "Thor" recognized this, as did the original "Thor" movie, and now its more cosmic, world-spanning sequel, "Thor: The Dark World" (hereafter "Thor: DW"). Even though not only Earth (Midgard) but all the Nine Realms of Norse legend including Asgard, abode of the gods, are threatened by an existence-ending "Dark Side" as embodied by the liquid Aether, "Thor: DW" manages to intersperse and sprinkle dry, understated, but sharp humorous dialogue and situations throughout its epic tale.This is no trivial feat, since along with the expected warrior battles and clashes and imminent Armageddon (or Ragnarok), "Thor: DW" deals with forbidden mortal love, latent mortal/deity romantic jealousy, incorrigible and enigmatic siblings, obstinate and imperious fathers, self- sacrificing goddesses, unhinged astronomical geniuses, and charting your own destiny. Within each of these elements "Thor: DW" explores both their serious and light-hearted sides.Pointy-eared but cruelly saturnine Malekith (Christopher Eccleston), the Dark Elves' leader seeks the Aether to bring back the darkness they need to live and extinguish the hated brilliance of Asgard and the other worlds. The Asgardians, led by Thor wielding his enchanted hammer Mjolnir, have managed to wrest the Aether from the Dark Elves and hidden it within what they think is a totally unexpected place. However, astrophysicist and Thor's mortal love interest Jane Porter, incensed by the Thunder God's long absence, attempts to locate a dimensional portal in order to contact him again. Concealed within a London warehouse district, she finds not only the portal, but the Aether as well. The Aether possesses her.Malekith, with the brutal assistance of the ape-like juggernaut (no, not that Juggernaut) Algrim/Kurse, has sought to recover the Aether for over 5,000 years and use it for universal darkness once the Nine Realms are linearly aligned. Realizing that Jane has now become the Aether's vessel, Thor transports her to Asgard in an initial attempt to protect her from Malekith. Nevertheless, Malekith, Algrim, and the Dark Elf armada of dagger-shaped ships soon breach even Asgard's seemingly-impervious defenses.Against the edicts of the Lord of Asgard and Thor's father Odin (Anthony Hopkins), Thor decides that instead of remaining besieged behind Asgard's fortress, he will take Jane to true safety in an obscure dimension. To do this, he must free and make an uncertain Faustian alliance with the God of Deceit and Evil, Loki (Tom Hiddleston), imprisoned in an Asgardian dungeon for crimes he committed in the "Avengers" movie. To buy time for the escape, Thor asks the omniscient, all-sensing Guardian of Asgard Heimdall(Idris Elba) to risk treason by running interference for him. And so "Thor: DW" boils down to whether Thor can save Jane and the Nine Realms (including Earth) from Malekith and the Aether.Yep, these are literally deadly serious issues the movie is dealing with. But with effortless skill, "Thor: DW" sees the inherent overwrought silliness of it all and gently teases and prods it without diminishing the importance of these issues. For example, Thor faces a towering, Goliath stone creature in a scene that might remind you of Indiana Jones and the swordsman in "Raiders of the Lost Ark". As another example, to help the jailbreak along, Loki transforms himself and Thor into various figures including an out-of-left field patriotic one. Back on Earth, Jane's brash intern Darcy (Kat Dennings) sardonically and bemusedly comments on the wild proceedings when the Thor/Malekith battle spills over onto Midgard. Jane's oddball but enthusiastic mentor Dr. Erik Selvig, committed for streaking at Stonehenge, has nevertheless seemed to discover a gravity-shifting device that might avert the alignment, provided Darcy and her own callow but cute intern can get him out of the mental hospital. Finally, loved all the dimension-hopping and throwaway critters, especially in the very last scene.The humor also makes "Thor:DW" more relatable even to people who are not Thor or Norse mythology aficionados and fans. Without it (and without the introductory exposition) at the movie's beginning, newcomers might be at a bit of a loss as to who these outlandish characters are and what the heck they're fighting for. They might not know who grim Hogun (Tadanobu Asano), dashing Fandral (Zachary Levi), voluminous Volstagg (Ray Stevenson), or the stunning Sif (Jaime Alexander) are, but they know about romantic entanglements (Sif gives Jane such a stare), a son's duty to a father (Thor in Odin's shadow), and perseverance in finding the hidden bravery and self-sacrifice of a previously selfish and treacherous brother (Loki's helping Thor defend Jane), and finding the courage to blaze your own trail in life (Thor resolving to stay with Jane on Earth). Therefore, "Thor:DW" manages the neat trick of making Armageddon not only foreboding but also satisfyingly enjoyable. 4.5 starsP.S.: "Thor:DW" is a self-contained story in and of itself, even if you haven't seen the first "Thor" movie. But I heartily recommend you see the first movie, and watch the credits of this movie, because they continue Thor's story and raise doubts about Loki's reformation, AND connect to a broader Avengers story line involving some powerful stones. Verily, Thor will return.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Generic and bland, but not terrible</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Thor: The Dark World follows the same formula as all the other big budget block buster franchise sequels. More action, more explosions, more drama, also, more "grey". What is it with all the new adventure movies and extremely bland colors? The original Thor managed to keep me interested and excited throughout the entire film, but this time I really didn't find myself having very much concern for any of the characters. Now, I know the plot is important, but It's hard to care about a plot when you don't care if the characters live or die. I found I was bored, and completely uninterested in the usual banter between Thor, Loki and Odin. It's become very dull and predictable. I also never really found myself rooting for anyone, unlike the first film where I found myself rooting for multiple characters. Whatever made the chemistry work in Thor seems to be almost lost in the sequel. The pacing was slow in all the wrong places, and the dialogue in my opinion went from acceptable to corny with nothing in between. All of the comic relief was terrible and did not work. The Chemistry between Thor and Jane lacked sincerity, and Darcy's character actually made me roll my eyes on several occasions. She's pretty much the Jar Jar Binks of this franchise...Just there so the kids can have a character to relate to. What was good about the film? Clearly a lot of effort was put into the visual effects and action sequences, I guess that's worth noting and the plot itself is not bad either. Basically, it's your run of the mill action sequel. Not terrible, but not great either. Just bland. In conclusion, although this is not a great film, it's watchable and if you're someone following the Marvel Universe, it's kind of a must watch as some major events take place.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No Lessons Learned</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lulz. The IMDb rating is at a solid 7.2, but the written reviews are mostly panning the movie. And rightfully so. Thor 2 does little to improve from the last entry. While we have better visuals and more Loki, the character, plot devices, and comedic relieve are just as bad, if not worse. If it weren't for the enormous budget, the movie would have blew. I usually give some lenience towards plot devices. You can't let small parts of a movie ruin the entire experience. But crap were they awful here. I've rarely seen a film so contrived, so desperate to use characters that don't belong. But we need to have the brothers team up, and who would our Norse God be without a beautiful woman by his side? The Aether has no rhyme or reason to what it actually does, and the villains were store shelf. But none of the characters had enough time to develop beyond movie clichés.I disliked Kat Dennings in the first one. Now I hate her. She's a complete ditz who has no respect for the impossible events going on. She breaks tense moments with dollar-store lines, devoid of comedic creativity. But we also have some useless intern, and Dr. Erik Selvig. He's turned into "movie crazy", a man who acts delusional, but is really a misunderstood genius. Its a stupid and offensive plot point, made by imbeciles who don't know, nor care, about mental health. Thor's Girlfriend (it might as well be her name) still lacks any connection with Thor, and is such a bit player in the story. She's supposed to be a genius scientist, but everything she says is Hollywood gobbledegook. The only strength beyond the production values is Loki. Most of the good moments of the film revolve around him. He has the most personality, and is the only character to develop in any way. But his relationships still need fleshing out. I need more time to buy his love and hate for his family.Are you really that desperate for a time-waster? C'mon. There are better action movies out there. Thor: Dark World will soon be forgotten. I'd never recommend it, but there's worse I suppose.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having watched it a second time and checking out the reviews here, I'm amazed how many people didn't like it. I thought it the strongest in the Marvel Universe series after Avengers and Captain America: The Winter Soldier. Yes, better than Iron Man (all of them).Casting is solid, with a great bad guy, the storyline is appropriately over the top, without too much attention to character development, and the whole feel of the move is that of an epic myth, in a comic context. Those are traits of many comics, and not necessarily bad ones.Maybe it's my interest in Nordic mythology which gives Thor the edge, or the astonishingly great, epic scenes in the movie. Or Loki, who is mostly great, as before.Highly recommended - don't pay too much attention to reviews!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>We're up all night to get Loki</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first half of the film was very boring and did NOTHING to engage the audience. The film only really picked up just before Loki was broken out of his cell by Thor. Characters (apart from Loki) were bland and extremely boring, Malekith was terrible, the Aether just seemed like another Tesseract, his army were a little too similar to the Chitari for my liking and may as well have just been Storm Troopers and the whole "turning the entire universe into darkness" plot line seemed too cliché. Special effects were special. What was with the weird colour scheme used and the blurry backgrounds? It looked like something out of 300. Asgard still looked nice. I enjoyed seeing Loki and Thor team-up but Thor's action sequences on his own weren't that good. The final battle was a little too reminiscent of the IM3 final battle for my liking; Thor jumping into different worlds/Tony jumping into different Iron Man suits. So, this film is only really good enough because of Loki. If it wasn't for the character and his excellent portrayal by Tom Hiddleston, this film would most likely get a 3/10. If you want to know what happens in the film because you want to catch up with the Marvel Cinematic Universe, just read the plot online and maybe watch a montage of the best Loki moments in the film.</fullReview>

I'm not saying that they recorded a very bad films, but to me they are just average (except for Iron Man and The Avengers). So record a movie and give a teaser to another, recording another, giving a teaser for the third, and so on ... What concerns the film itself, I was somewhat impressed. They're great cast assembled for this movie, but we know who will spend most of their time on the big screen. Fight scenes and CGI are superb as expected, but I still want something a little more than a movie. I liked Loki, who confirmed his class. The effects are excellent, although I felt a little robbed Star Wars, but alright. Of course, there is a scene after the credits, and then patience for a minute, if a little track you will see they announced another film in the world of Marvel. The new machine for printing money.

		<fullReview>First off, I wasn't crazy about the first Thor film. It could have been a lot worse, but surprisingly it wasn't as bad as I thought it would be, but it's not my favorite Phase 1 film, if I gave it a grade it would be a 6.3/10That being said, Thor: The Dark World, is flawed, but it is leaps and beyond better than the first Thor film. I say that because there are less scenes of Earth, and a lot more Asgard and the nine-realms. I loved the impressive visuals of the Asgardian world that Marvel created and it was pure eye-candy. Hemsworth and Hiddleston truly shine in this film. They're back and better than ever as Thor and Loki. I loved watching their brotherly banter and how Frigga's death cause them, mostly Loki to undergo some character transformations. I also liked Loki's little "redemption" path, and there is a touching scene with him and Thor when Loki is supposedly "dead." Surprisingly there was a lot of humor, which were very humorous at times. Natalie Portman is wonderful as Jane, Stellan Skarsgard is a lot more humorous this time around, and Kat Dennings as Darcy is used for comic relief, very overused might I add. I disliked her character a lot in the first film, and that hasn't changed since. And lets not forget the Captain America cameo, that was so awesome. There's much more action in this film than the first Thor film. The action in the first film peaked when they fought the Frost Giants, but here there's plenty. I loved every action set piece, especially the climax. Director Alan Taylor does a good job blending in fantasy and sci- fi all together, also adding a touch of Game of Thrones in there. As a matter of fact I think he did a better job than Kenneth Branagh in introducing the world of Asgard. My biggest complain in this film is the villain. I wanted more of Malekith in this film. Christopher Eccleston portrays an awesome Malekith, but however there really isn't much character development over him. He's just shown as an evil dude who wants to bring the world to darkness. Nothing more. Aside from a brief introduction told by Odin at the beginning about who he is and what his plan is, there isn't any other character development for Malekith and he really suffers because of this. He doesn't interact with enough characters only Thor and he never goes into any detail about why he's doing what he's doing without a clear motive or reason. Even though they had their own action moments, certain characters like Lady Sif and the Warriors Three that were promised larger roles instead were minor which was sort of a bummer. I also very much indeed enjoyed the two after-credit scenes. However, I can see why Alan Taylor and some others felt that the Guardians of the Galaxy scene felt a little weird and out of place, but nevertheless really cool and the movie turned out to be a blast. The last one was just inserted for the humor. Thor returns to Earth and makes out with Jane, and a Jotunheim monster chases some birds. I'm very curious about where they take Loki this time around and whatever happened to Odin. This film has a re-watch ability factor, where as the first Thor didn't. Captain America: The Winter Soldier and Guardians of the Galaxy also have re-watch ability factor, the only film that doesn't so far in Phase 2 is Iron Man 3. Iron Man 3 is okay at best, and it's definitely not a film I enjoyed a second time around.Thor: The Dark World is just pure popcorn entertainment. 7/10</fullReview>

Now in these reviews I talk about the best and the worst of the movie so here we go.The Worst Now for what I have to say who the hell was Malekith, to be truthful I haven't read the comics or studied the villain a whole lot but still why focus on another villain who shows up for one movie then disappears for good. Also I am getting sick and tired of them teasing the Avengers and none of them showing up ever.The Best Loki is still as awesome in this movie as he was in the first Thor and the Avengers and the end of this movie when he is impersonating Odin is so epic. I also have to say it was awesome to see Thor with his powers for the whole movie and that the comedy was their and it was hilarious, my funniest scene was when the were walking down the hallway and Loki was impersonating different characters.So overall the movie is a good time and a great Thor film overall I say if you see it on sale it is worth the money.</fullReview>

Asgard and Thor's supporting characters made a very cameo appearances and much of the film was based on earth with Kat (Darcy Lewis), Jane (Natalie Portman), and Kat's love interest (who wasn't in the first film). I appreciate the inclusion of Thor's love, Jane, but the other two had too much time and I don't think are interesting enough characters.The action scenes were short and none come anywhere near matching the opening fight scene with the frost giants in the first film.Chris Hemsworth (Thor) and Tom Hiddleston (Loki) played their roles well but with a weak script it wasn't enough to save it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>He may look like the washed up star of an 80's rock group, but Thor is definitely a Superhero. Look at him... swinging his hammer around, flying through the sky, saving countless lives in the Nine Realms he protects... What a guy. His brother Loki might be a bad sort (he's already tried to destroy the world twice) but good ol' Thor will always be there to save the day. And we need him now more than ever... Because some Dark Elf is going to blow up our planet with the aid of The Biggest TV Transmitter Ever.Sadly it pains me to reveal our long-haired demi-god has problems of his own. Ya see, the love of his life, the apple of his eye, (a human FYI, our friend Thor doesn't know the meaning of the word discrimination) has been infected with a rare life-form which will KILL her. For a crisis this big, What will Thor do? What's that you say? Team up with his despised brother on a suicide mission to save the girl and the Earth? I never would have thought...So, yeah. This is exciting. It's thrilling. It also has a naked dude roaming around Stonehenge, but seeing as everything is pixellated, let's not hold that against it too much. The highlight is Loki and Thor's enforced partnership, though it doesn't last very long. Seeing these complete opposites who don't trust each other one inch attempting to fight their enemies and each other simultaneously is great fun. Can you say 'The Odd Couple'? It's got all the popcorn crackling entertainment you'd expect from a Marvel production. Roll on the next one. Until then, I'll have to make do with my handcrafted puppets... 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Thor Dark World starts two years after the events of 'The Avengers' as a great evil known as the darkness possesses Thors girlfriend Jane Foster (what a random coincidence!). Thus Thor must save her and the rest of the world from dark elves who seek to use the darkness to destroy the universe. The stakes are supposedly higher, but it never feels that way. Even in the final fight then it never feels like Thor is ever in any real peril. The dark elves just never appear as that much of a challenge in the film. Not only do they not pose a threat but they never appear as interesting characters either, even the leader of the Dark Elves Malketh doesn't get much attention. Whilst Ecclestons performance is impressive and the makeup design is interesting, the villain doesn't get any background. Malekth's sole motivation in the film is to destroy the universe. Why? Because he is evil! At least that's all we really get from him. Largely because the dark elves don't get that much screen time. More time seems to get put towards bringing back the fan favourite Loki to the film.This could be good if he were written in properly. But the problem is that he isn't. Loki was only written in after the success of the Avengers and doesn't really have any role to play. They try to justify his inclusion in the plot at times, but the truth is he is there for fan appeal alone. He's the kind of character who you could remove all of his scenes from the film and you'd still get a complete story regardless. Saying this, Loki does still have many enjoyable moments. He still has the same memorable wit people loved from the Avengers and Hiddelston does have quite a few scene stealing moments. Thor is still an enjoyable hero in this one. Though his story isn't as interesting. In the first we got to see his transition from a reckless soldier to a noble warrior to gain the worthiness of his hammer Monjir. But here he doesn't really progress at all. But for what he has to work with Hemsworth gives a good performance once again as the Norse god of thunder. His presence alone is one of great power and his delivery does make for some hilarious moments. On the downside many of the action scenes in the film are pretty forgettable. Largely because most of them don't feel particularly well choreographed. Most of the earlier fight scenes try to look like a big epic battle scene, but they never really feel that way. They'll always be in some interesting backdrops ranging from fantasy cities like Asgard to the populated city of London. But they will usually lack any real sense of excitement that we expect from the Marvel universe. Luckily the final fight does make up for this with a fight between Malketh and Thor stretching across several worlds. It makes little sense with the teleporting between worlds lacking any real sense of cohesive logic. But it still makes for both some cool visuals and funny moments.Out of the entirety of Marvel Phase 2, this is the weakest outing. It doesn't add anything original that we haven't already seen from the marvel franchise. In the end it's really nothing more than mindless action with a little bit of comedy thrown in. If that's all you want from a marvel film you might enjoy it. But if you're expecting the same charm and heroics of the rest of the marvel universe then you'll likely get let down.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty Good sequel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film takes place after the Avengers movie, where Dark Elves are returning to our universe to destroy it. Thor and Loki must work together to stop them.Chris Hemsworth is pretty good again as Thor. Tom Hiddelston once again steals the scenes he is in as Loki. Most of the cast from the original movie has returned, and put in solid performances.The most disappointing aspect is that Christopher Eccelston plays a villain that is completely forgettable. Seriously, I barely recognized the guy and frankly, they could have done him as CGI and no one would have noticed the difference. (Of course, his turn as Doctor Who was equally forgettable.) And, yes, you had a twist ending everyone should have seen coming. No doubt, setting up Thor III.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Me Thor, you Jane</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It sure was Dark all right, they weren't wrong there. It's as well to remember this is Marvel-Disney; so what if there's the odd mix of dark menace and light-hearted frivolity, it's only a motion picture after all. I enjoyed the first Thor but the second was even more stylish and enjoyable if weighed down by even more nonsense-science.Er, basically primeval dark forces attack Asgard ? and Greenwich, London ? pretty obviously via gravity space-time wormholes, Thor's girlfriend Jane is accidentally invested with a sinister Mcguffin power that is chased after by the head baddie (whose physog reminded me of a young Davros from Dr Who), Thor doesn't trust Loki and Loki doesn't blame him, and cartoon bones and concrete are crunched remorselessly from the off. On the way to the crackers climax Thor obediently hangs his hammer up on a handy coat rack and decides to catch a handy tube to get to the final battle in time. Light comedic touches like those always go down well with me, I love panache when trying sell a ridiculous plot or watching a film revelling in brazen brainlessness. It's also the first film I've ever seen to contain a last minute killer twist, then a sinister teaser for the next film, and finally a droll comedy moment to end on but one that would definitely have dire implications for anyone happening to be walking by at that moment! As with the first film I thought Tom Hiddleston stole the show, and Idris Elba had a marvellously enigmatic character to portray. And again, the serious reason for some of the warring sides to fight with swords and some with guns escapes me, as it did at 11 years old reading Edgar Rice Burroughs' Martian series. The cgi cartoonery seemed perfect to me, capturing flawless vistas of other worlds and impressive violence alike to these old eyes.The kids would probably make much more sense of it all than I could, and maybe even follow the swift impenetrably dark battles successfully ? me, I went along with it in the right spirit and thoroughly enjoyed it. I mean why bother giving it a chance at all unless you want it to work?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>made me remind of Star Wars</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first like to say that I enjoyed the movie and it's a very good sequel to the 1st one and the Avengers. I think it's also better than the first because I like the story better and there are more twists to the story, the first one was pretty straight forward. This one's got action, drama, comedy which is all used very well and everyone that is someone have their good moments. Thing is that the alien worlds and space battles made me think of the Star Wars battles, I really like Star Wars and I didn't really wanted to see it in this movie, that is what made me dislike it a little. And of course the use of "epicness" as in all avenger-like movies is just a little much, but I accept it and still enjoyed it. In the end, I will recommend it to everyone who enjoys a good superhero movie and I'll most likely see it again soon because I like watching movies that I like a few times.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Solid Improvement Over the Original THOR</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I may be alone in this opinion but I believed Kenneth Branagh's THOR was the weakest film in the first phase of Marvel films. Yes, even weaker than IRON MAN 2. It wasn't that I hated the film but it failed to leave any sort of impression on me. Thor was always going to be one of the more difficult characters for Marvel to bring to the big screen. As opposed to characters with more "grounded" (in the loosest sense of the term) origins, Thor is a more mystical being. He's a demigod from another dimension who's near invulnerable to most forms of damage. So, right off the bat, he's not the easiest to relate to. So the first film went the route of a "fish- out-of-water" scenario as Thor loses his Asgardian powers and is banished to Earth to learn his lesson. So he spends a nice portion of the movie without actually being a superhero and we spend it on Earth. You know, that place we've spent every other Marvel movie to that point despite Marvel having a rich mythology with countless other possibilities. So, yeah, THOR was enjoyable but forgettable. But THE DARK WORLD corrects for these past weaknesses and actually brought us a Thor movie that I really enjoyed. The movie begins following the events of THE AVENGERS, with Loki condemned to the Asgardian dungeon for his crimes and Thor struggling to clean up the mess his brother's defiance had created across the Nine Realms.So, for starters, that's a major bonus in this film. We get a nice glimpse of realms other than Asgard, Earth, and Jotunheim. We even get to visit Vanaheim and Svartalfheim. So finally, the Thor films spread their wings a bit and we spend very little time on Earth this time around. It gave the filmmakers opportunities to have some fun with the production design. We get a much grander view of Asgard. It doesn't necessarily look as polished this time around. The first film made Asgard out to be very polished and shiny while THE DARK WORLD gives it a more tactile appearance with stone constructs and shady taverns. Svartalfheim is nothing more than a desolate wasteland with dark sands and a bizarre greenish atmosphere. It is the home of the film's villains, the Dark Elves. With their ruler, Malekith (Christopher Eccleston, the Dark Elves have been around since the creation of our universe and once thrived in the darkness before it's creation. Since the arrival of our universe and the light it brought, the Elves have been fighting for a means of eliminating it to return the universe to ever-lasting darkness. They'd been defeated once before by the Asgardians, under the command of Thor's grandfather Bor. They are awaken from their slumber once again when Jane Foster (Natalie Portman, returning) stumbles across the MCU's latest mystical artifact, the Aether. We never really get a good idea of what the Aether does. We're just told that it's incredibly powerful and Malekith can somehow use it to bring darkness across the Nine Realms during a cosmic event known as the Convergence when all of the realms align.There's our first misstep. The Aether is poorly explained. We see that it has some pretty nifty powers but their never really defined. It's just a shapeless mass of red liquid that provides its owner with seemingly unlimited power. We know these films are bound to have MacGuffins but do we need to treat them so shoddily? Give us some history, some detail. Malekith is obsessed with it and, again, that's about as much detail we get on another important aspect of the story. There have been a lot of complaints about Malekith being underdeveloped and I can't say I entirely disagree. We have a basic motivation and that's about it. He wants to return the universe to darkness and he'll stop at nothing to accomplish it, but give us some more. There has to be more to him. He seems like such a cool character. He could've easily been one of the better MCU villains with some extra time spent getting to know him, but he's relegated to a single mindless goal. The Dark Elves seem to be a very proud people and their talented warriors. There's some history there, so give us a bit. I love their visual style. The black and white color scheme and emotionless face masks give them a wicked creepy appearance. And Kurse is probably the best creature design in any of the films. Director Alan Taylor and his team nailed it with the film's visuals.The cast is mostly fantastic as well. Chris Hemsworth and Tom Hiddleston inhabit their roles at this point better than I can imagine anyone else would. There's a great brotherly chemistry between them and each of them have grown over the MCU series. Thor has become the noble warrior he was destined to be, surpassing even his father in his tact and strength. Loki continues to reign as one of Marvel's best movie villains and he's given a chance to show a more compassionate side when tragic events give him a reason to fight alongside his brother. Natalie Portman continues to prove that she's just not quite meant for comic movies. I know she's got talent but she always comes across as wooden as Jane in these movies. Kat Dennings returns as unnecessary comic relief and, while I was fine with her excessive goofiness in the first movie, it wasn't really needed here. THE DARK WORLD is a more serious film than it's predecessor and I would've been fine with the little bit of humor that comes through the Thor/Loki interactions. Christopher Eccleston and Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje are wasted potential as the baddies but they do the best with the limited material they're given.In the end, THE DARK WORLD is a great sequel to a decent film and helped solidify Marvel's second phase of films as an improvement.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie improves on the last Thor film. It's nicely paced and has some excellent action scenes. In its eagerness to make clear to the audience that this is going to be a big action movie, the early part has a lot of chaotic noise to it, which is perhaps why the first scene I really liked was a peaceful one in an abandoned building. Once the movie caught me interest I stayed caught. The story is coherent without any instantly noticeable plot holes, which is about as much as you can hope for from the typical superhero movie, and there are some nice surprises and some good WOAH moments. Performances were good.It's certainly formulaic, but it uses that formula well.</fullReview>

The action is relentless. I still don't understand what actually happened - some ancient enemies were defeated but they came back and wielded phenomenal cosmic power and had some awesome space ships and shot lasers at the Norse Gods who fired their lasers back.

		<shortDescription>By Asgard? this is fun!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you haven't seen one of the recent crop of 'Marvel comic book movies' then 'Thor: The Dark World' is probably a bit of an odd place to start. So, assuming you've already enjoyed anything from Thor 1 to Iron Man 3, then you'll probably enjoy this, too. It follows the whole 'Marvel superhero formula' pretty closely and, if I'm being harsh, doesn't really bring anything new to the table. However, when a movie is this much fun, a lack of originality isn't that much of a problem.It's a fun, action-packed romp and, even if you haven't seen the first one (or any other Marvel film of late) then, as long as you understand the basic concept of 'good vs evil' then you should have no problem picking up on what's happening.Chris Hemsworth is great as Thor. Tom Hiddleston is equally great as Thor's nemesis 'Loki' and the rest of the cast all play their parts well, too.So, all you need is a big bucket of popcorn and an hour and forty-four minutes to kill and you should enjoy some seriously fun 'hammer time.' Oh, and don't forget about no less that TWO 'secret' scenes hidden within the credits. 'Guardians of the Galaxy,' here we come!http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Loki steals the show again - Marvel needs to work on its plot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although Thor, the namesake of the movie series, is masculinity incarnate; there is little doubt that the audience is not really impressed by the hammer brandishing deity - likely because Thor pales in comparison whenever the arch villain Loki makes an appearance. Perhaps one should congratulate Marvel on the success of creating this charismatic evil character who even dominates The Avengers, not to mention the spawning of countless fanfiction and secondary creation. Marvel needs to work on the storyline as it is stretching thin, what is the remote probability of all this new dark energy targeting Thor's ladylove as a host, out of zillions of beings to choose from the vast universe with the nine realms? The plot feels flimsy to begin with, and though the brilliant coup and contracoup actions by the brothers near the end are exciting, the actual final scene is an inevitable anticlimax and seems like child's play. The only solace being the hint of yet another sequel - with our favorite villain it, of course.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Only the names are from Norse mythology</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Thor: The Dark World. Had to watch it over three days, since I kept getting distracted by other things. E-mail, Facebook, coffee, BOREDOM.Any relation between this and Norse mythology is merely in the names. Thor could not fly; he rode a chariot. His hammer only returned to him if he wore magic gloves. Frigga was not Thor's mother, Jör? was Odin's love and Thor's mother. Loki was not evil, merely a particularly annoying practical joker and mischief maker. Odin was not a peace keeper, he was a pure warmonger always willing to start a fight. Sif was not a warrior, she was goddess of the harvest and grain--and blond. Of all the characters depicted in this movie, only Heimdall was fairly accurate. Natalie Portman is always pleasant to see, but her limited role in this film was not enough to salvage this pathetic excuse for a movie.IMDb viewers gave this movie a 7.2, obviously because they have more familiarity with Marvel comics than Norse mythology. Very sad.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If I had to describe this film in one word, it would be: meh. The movie is average at best. The story is very bland and anticlimactic as you never really feel the result is ever in doubt. Yes, I know it's a Marvel movie, but with films like Spider-Man 2 (2004), Iron Man, X-Men First Class and X-Men: Days of Future Past it's clear that Marvel can make a really great film when they want to. It just feels like the movie never really tries to make you question whether there is any really danger and seems like Marvel going through the motions expanding on it's catalogue. Having said that, there is just enough action and more than enough comedy to justify your ticket (and really, that's why we watch these isn't it?). Tom Hiddleston continues to be one of the more interesting actors in the Marvel films and he doesn't disappoint here. In my opinion, this is the least compelling Marvel film since Captain America and no where near as enjoyable as the first Thor film. You can pass on this one. Enjoyed my review? Keep in touch!

		<shortDescription>the first movie of comic heroes is always the best and...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>this was no exception. The film was OK but the first one was better. The funny scenes are the best when the superhero first makes himself known or discovers the super powers. Then in the sequels everyone knows about him and it's just not as good.In this sequel little even takes place on Earth, most of it nd attacks is on Asgard. Jane and her interns discover some kind of portal to the dark world and some how she gets the aether absorbed into her, which made little sense. And the aether is a great power than can conquer worlds. Thor goes back to earth to check on Jane and then she "zaps" people with energy and then she goes back with him to Asgard. Then this evil elf awakens attacks Asgard, chases ensue and some how they get to the dark world right where the portal to earth is. Then they go back to the earth and the elf follows. Then there is a some what tame battle on earth. Are you following me? See how crazy this is, the plot just didn't work.FINAL VERDICT: There is the Chris Hemsworth without a shirt scene, so that's cool to check out, plus the evil dudes that were rip offs of the predator were neat. I'd say this movie is for people whom don't want to think while watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Ultimate Movie Review! - http://tss5078.blogspot.com - @tss5078</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's no secret that I've always hated superhero movies. I find them to be cliché, over the top, and so far from reality, that often time the stories are just the lowest form of Science Fiction. The only movies of the superhero genre that I've ever truly enjoyed are the recent Batman trilogy and some of the recent Marvel films. That being said, I hated the first Thor film, because it came directly from a comic book and lacked any kind of background story whatsoever. Thanks in part to the Avengers and the development of the Loki character, that all changes with the second film. The story isn't directly from a comic book, but rather based on one. In this film, the characters are more established and there is a lengthy background story that only enhances the film, and the series. In the second film, Thor is tasked with stopping a deadly weapon, possessed by an all but extinct species. This weapon has the power to destroy the entire universe and as always, the focal point is on Earth. Unable to stop the weapon and save his girlfriend at the same time, Thor turns to an unlikely source for help, his now imprisoned brother, Loki. Given the magnitude of the story and the power of the enemy, I'm a bit surprised that they didn't keep this film to be used as an Avengers sequel, as it has all the makings of an epic sequel. Chris Hemsworth reprises his role as Thor and this time he is beyond terrific. His role in the Avengers really enhanced the popularity of a character that most people were unfamiliar with, and the tremendous start to the film really set the framework for Hemsworth to take Thor to the next level. Even the supporting cast steps it up a notch as Natalie Portman is more used to the idea of a boyfriend from another world and being involved in things she couldn't possibly understand. Finally, Tom Hiddleston tops of the story, with his portrayal of Loki. I may be going out on a limb here, but I thought Hiddleston was even better in The Dark World than he was in The Avengers. Going into the Avengers, next to The Hulk, Thor was the weakest of the introduction films, and the least known and appreciated character. That all changed with the Avengers and in his second film, the Thor character steps up to a level that rivals even Iron Man. If you're not that into the series and have only selectively seen a few of the films, make sure you include the Dark World, as it is essential to fully understanding Thor and his impact in the future of the series.</fullReview>

Some of the best parts were worked into the effects as well.....like Thor flying to the scene and holding his arm up waiting for the hammer......some of the space scenes .....I also thought the fight scenes were realistic for this film and done well. The anger that turns to rage seem logical and acted well. The costumes fit the characters and were done very well. Loki and Thor really sold the action for me. Driving in the space mobile through people.....trees.....buildings......great stuff. I wasn't too sure about this movie before watching it, but I thought it was exciting and action packed and a wonderful use of effects/CGI.

		<shortDescription>Well its Thor 2...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well if your a fan of Thor i don't see no reason why wont you like it. If your the main stream audience who just want something sparky-sparky bum-bum while chewing on popcorn you will like it too. If you expect Shakespearean depths... well if the fact that its a movie based on a comic book based on North mythology chewed by Uncle Sam didn't give you a hint its might not be your type of movie, i don't know what would have? For most of the part the film dose good with what its aims for... i think (i mean i never read any Thor comic book which i could compare it too)It has its moments, even though there are things that are pretty easy to figure out like the romance between Daisy and the intern. And sometimes the movie is stupid like when you put so much focus on Loki can not be trusted. Like 4 characters say "he will betray you" than 4 characters tell him "i will kill you, if you betray Thor" and Thor admits it he counting on Loki trying to betray him, and says like 2 times he dose not trust him. There plan depends on Lokis ability's of creating illusions. And its not like he did something terrible twice... oh wait he did. So after this much build up not even going "hm... maybe i should really check if his really dead, or not just let him lay on the ground" is the stupidest thing you can do. Its like Batman putting the Joker in a room with innocent people and going "they will be fine" If you just want some fun without too high expectations you probably will like it. I enjoyed it my self as a watchable once type of movie. But there are things which annoyed me i would like to address. 1) I know coming up with new stuff is hard, but could you at least drop the clichés? the first scene daisy and intern where together and daisy ignored her and did not listen to her it was clear they will just hook up at the end of the movie. things like this dose not make your movie better it drags it down. And watch out for stupid stuff. For example the death of the queen. I liked her strength and courage. What i did not like that the situation was stupid. How many guards where around Odin and Thor? I cant imagine a situation where for example the white house gets attacked and security goes "lets protect the president and his son - What about the first lady? - meh she will be fine" Shes the queen, when a unknown enemy attacks your fortress, you bloody protect the queen too, beside the king and there son. Anyways there also the thing i detailed before about Loki. And a small thing the creature which eat a few dark elf than till the end credits poof in to nothing. Im guessing its a predator, and somewhat Elephant size... so its probably eats a lot. And in a populated city there are plenty food = people. So seriously no body though "might not be a bright idea to leave the giant predator roam around freely. 2) this is my personal opinion: Natalie Portman is a over rated actress, and she sucks in the sci-fi/action movies. She was terrible as Padme and keeps bringing the same bad acting as Jane Foster. I think shes more of a diva type, its always like Natalie Portman trying to play x character, and probably thinking about the Oscar party, or nail polish or plaza kitten stuff. 3) Stop inventing stupid alien languages. Or if you really need to do it make a nerd version and regular version. So the 25% nerd who actually gets a boner from a made up fake language can go to the nerd version. And 75% who dose not give a s*** or gets frustrated cause main characters keep speaking in a stupid gibberish language, and misses few words form the subtitle and loses the plot, there for the interest in the movie... its freaking Thor, if we are able to accept that the north mythology was "true" except they where aliens, we can handle aliens probably having there own language, but speaking English so the stupid non-sense blubbering dose not confuse us. 4)Im from Hungary. Americans pretty much the only nation who try to steal other nations myths and make a own version of it. And they are also the ones who will enjoy it the most. This is why characters like Thor and Wonder Woman will never be as popular in EU as they are in the US. This is why Thor is my least favorite Avenger. I think it improved a bit from the last movie, I mean we see more Asgard technology in this one, but beside this its still really unimaginative. Take a side that the idea to make North Myth in to a comic is stupid on its own. It still has the feeling that there civilization aren't involving. They still pretty much dress, battle, party like in the medieval with some polish. Just think about it how much human clothing, buildings, definition of fun, social interactions, views, religions... pretty much how everything changed several times in thousands of years. Not to mention this guys live thousand years people change often from decade to decade cause they learn and experience, what would a being who experience thousand years would be like? Imagine if for example Einstein would have lived for 5000 years what impact he would have than had on humanity? They don't have Geniuses in Asgard? I never able to shrug of the feeling that world(s)Thor trying to create just stopped in evolving and only exist so Americans can claim North Mythology as there own. And that's pretty much while Thor in best a watch able once popcorn cinema for me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The plot isn't anything mind blowing, and like most superhero movies, the dialogue was incredibly cheesy and it made me cringe at times. I don't know if it was just Natalie Portman's acting or Jane's character, but her vulnerability annoyed the heck out of me. She was just a really flat character. I give it a 5 because of Loki. First of all, Tom Hiddleston IS an amazing actor. Second, Loki himself is three-dimensional, unpredictable, and advanced character, and I am so intrigued because he is so DIFFERENT from other Marvel villains. I feel like the movie really revolves around him rather than Thor. Overall, it did exceed my expectations because I thought Thor, the first movie, was terrible and The Dark World was a little better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Follow-up to the 2011 movie THOR.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw it on DVD, a loaner from my public library. This is a follow-up to the 2011 movie "THOR" with most of the same cast and characters, and a new story bridging from the other. Chris Hemsworth is back as Thor with his trusty hammer. Natalie Portman is back as his love interest he met when sent to Earth. Tom Hiddleston is back as Thor's untrustworthy brother Loki. Anthony Hopkins is back as their father, King of Asgard, Odin. It was fun seeing a new cast member, Zachary Levi, of the old "Chuck" TV series, here as Fandral. I enjoyed him so much in the TV series, I am glad he is getting some movie roles. Anyway the story is convoluted but as these types of stories go match good vs evil. There is a convergence of 9 realms which only happens every 5000 years, and when it does they interact in strange and unpredictable ways. There is ample comedy sprinkled throughout so that the movie doesn't take itself too seriously. The big climax is at Greenwich, outside London on the Thames, and involves a very large alien craft plowing into the land. As we might imagine, the good guys, with great difficulty, prevail.I am sort of an odd viewer of this sort of action movie, I don't really care that much about the story. I enjoy the characters, the action, and especially the sound. I have a home theater with a really great powered subwoofer and during many of the action scenes there is real deep, body- vibrating bass, in the LFE track. To me, that was the best part of the whole movie-watching experience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Good action fodder, I enjoyed it. I was perturbed that there was no translation available on my disk for the Black Elves speech. We had to guess what they were saying. I was wondering if this was only the rental disk I was using, if so, that's a mean way to treat your audience for renting and not buying. I am hoping the future movies have a lil more plot, maybe some deeper character builds. This movie seemed a bit rushed, like a lot was left on the cutting room floor. (Directors cut probably). The Black Elves were interesting, but there was no substance to them, they could have been any bad guy. Their costumes were cool, but again, they never got interesting, and no subtitles forcing the audience to guess their words made it worse.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A well done comic related movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A really enjoyable movie and decent 3D effects in it although not over the top but I definitely oh'ed and ah'ed watching the movie. The graphics combined with great acting made for a very fun viewing. The combat definitely looked great with all the special effects added. The stone creature Thor absolutely obliterated was outstanding looking and that scene where he was defeated the stone creature was pretty funny. In fact I think on the subject of funny they did a good job of adding light hearted moments in this film without it feeling forced and not ending up corn ball.The main characters not from Earth were interesting. Thor, Loki and Odin had an interesting family dynamic going on. It kept me interested. I also did have my heart strings pulled when Thor's mom was killed. The funeral / ceremony to honour her death was very interesting and I wonder what all the parts of the ceremony meant. In regards to the ending to this movie it left me shocked and wondering what I missed. I definitely want to go back and look and see if I can figure out how Loki did what he did. I definitely will be interested to see the next movie if there is one planned.In regards to the acting it was what it should be. I would say that playing Thor had to be difficult and to not have it turn out cheese ball is an accomplishment for Chris Hemsworth.I should also mention that the scene where Loki, Tom Hiddleston, and Thor, Chris Hemsworth, fought together and supposedly the character Loki died well I thought that was really well played. Outstanding. Another example of where action/combat in this film shined.Let me finally say I was a person who knew nothing of this story coming in as I don't know the whole Marvel Comics thing and yet I found watching the film extremely enjoyable and in the end wanted more.I am going to give the movie a 7 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You can tell a lot of money was spent on this sequel to Thor (2011) but unfortunately as with tradition this sequel (like most sequels) does not live up to its original film and its sad because they had a very fleshy plot to play around with plus veritable villains to boot.First things first, this is either the first film or at least the first film in my recent memory that I've seen where the main villain was given so little to do. Loki (Tom Hiddleston) the secondary villain did his part and shined doing so but Malekith (Christopher Eccleston) king of the the dark elves was just wasted in his role in spite of him seeming so sinister and ruthlessly wicked in his introduction and initial scenes.Another footfall was the level of authenticity of Jane Foster's (Natalie Portman) possession, I mean she seemed possessed but if the great power within her was as strong as it was described by Odin (Anthony Hopkins) then it should have been shown to all but consume her and she should have been given some scenes in which she went over to the dark side and wreaked so much havoc. Sure she caused the death of Frigga (Rene Russo) but it wasn't an insidious act brought about by her possession. And speaking of Frigga, her funeral was one of the most beautiful send-offs ever captured on celluloid, just wish her sons would have mourned her properly and ruthlessly avenged her death. Darcy (Kat Dennings) Jane's trusty sidekick was her usual funny self but there was something off with her acting and even her humor at times. Kenneth Branagh really did a great job in directing her in part 1 where she was on her top game but unfortunately Alan Taylor was unable to capture the essence of this funny and witty character, instead he made her look hapless.Finally, for those who haven't seen 'Marvel's The Avengers' I suggest you do before watching this because there are so many references to the film during the course of 'Thor: The Dark World' that you might find yourself lost at times or at least wondering what they are on about. Though I will say that if you stayed for until the credits of 'Thor' finished rolling, you'll get a sense of why Erik Selvig (Stellan Skarsg?rd) is the way he is in this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nothing special plot wise, but the treatment of the female characters was horrible.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Thor 2: The Dark World Director: Alan Taylor Writers: Christopher Yost, Christopher Markus, Stephen McFeely, Don Payne, Robert Rodat, Stan Lee, Larry Leiber, and Jack Kirby Cast: Chris Hemsworth (Thor) Natalie Portman (Jane Foster) and Tom Hiddleston (Loki) Rating: 2.5/5 Review: Wow. That was horrible. OK-not horrible but still really bad. Well, plot wise anyway. If you want to look at the portrayal of the female characters, its negative star worthy. So the movie, on the surface, was what I've come to expect these days-meh plot, lots of CGI, a healthy mix of comic relief, and romantic scenes at the wrong times. Female Character Portrayal: GOD WHAT THE HECK HAPPENED HERE. Let's see? 1. Jane and Thor make kissy faces at each other the entire time 2. Frigga (Thor's mom) does some cool stuff and dies. Great. Kill off your only strong female character 3. Sif is hardly in it and has little control over the rebellion in the beginning. 4. Darcy is saved by the intern and makes out with him. THIS IS THE MOVIES BIGGEST PROBLEM TO ME. GUESS WHAT DARCY. HE SAVED YOU BECAUSE HE IS A DECENT HUMAN BEING. NOT BECAUSE HE HAS FEELINGS FOR YOU. AND YOU DON'T OWE HIM ANYSORT OF SEXUAL OR ROMANTIC INTERACTION BECAUSE HE SAVED YOU. YOU OWE HIM YOUR THANKS. THAT'S IT. F YOU MARVEL. So the plot: Like I said-meh. Aether is in Jane. Dark Elf guy wants it. Dark Elf guy gets it. There a big battle. The End. You may like this stuff, but I don't. Its formulaic and thus boring, and there is little to no character growth. I found myself so bored that I was discreetly checking Tumblr in the middle of the movie. Then something mildly interesting would happen and I'd start watching the movie again. Then I would get bored and feel the urge to read something. The closest book was These Broken Stars. I would have rather read that then watched a good portion of the movie. And I am NOT a fan of that book. There were a few good scenes and a few misplaced ones. Let's start with the misplaced. The newscast about Erik running around naked. Should have waited to revel that tidbit until the scene were Intern and Darcy found out. I guess Marvel was going for dramatic irony but it would have been a tad bit more suspenseful if we hadn't known. The kissing scene in Asgard. Let's see, the Aether is dangerous, no? Maybe you should work on getting it out and away from the Dark Elf guy instead? Or maybe have a conversation that doesn't end in kissing? I get that they missed each other, but they need to get their priorities straight. OK so now let's cover the good scenes. Far and few between. And usually didn't last for more than a second. The bit about Erik stripping and latter not wearing pants "because it helps him think" were funny. And the one where everyone told Loki "if you betray him I'll kill you" and then he replied "Evidently there will be a line". Then Loki died. Nice and dramatic. Shame he didn't stay dead. As a write this, I hear the future fangirls and fanboys gasping. But Loki! You say. He's misunderstood! Inner pain! His character has depth! No no and no. he is not misunderstood. He does have inner pain but that is no excuse. And yeah depth, but still. Doesn't necessarily make him a good guy. Reasons he is not misunderstood: 1. He consorted with the Frost Giants 2. He killed 80 people in one day 3. Enslaved Hawkeye and several other members of SHIELD 4. Tired to enslave the entire human race. This includes you. And you family and best friends. And probably would have let your pet starve. And this would mean no more Breaking Bad (or whatever show it is you watch) 5. Destroyed a large portion of NYC 6. Made all of Asgard vulnerable to attack from the Dark Elfs. 7. Got his mother killed. (Only person to care about him by the way) 8. Stabbed Thor. This guy is not be trusted. 9. Handed Jane over to the Dark Elfs. 10. He possibly killed Odin. 11. He is now ruling Asgard without anyone knowing what's what. Sounds pretty evil to me. You know what Loki is? A serial killer and a traitor to Asgard. He possibly killed Odin-WHO ADOPTED HIM AND RAISED HIM AS HIS OWN. EVEN THOUGH LOKI IS A FROST GIANT, ONE OF ASGARDS GREATEST ENEMIES . But he had a plan! No he didn't. Five thousand things could have gone wrong and he would simply do whatever he had to in order to survive. He doesn't care about anyone except his mother. And she's dead thanks to him. (Actually, I don't think he cares about his mother. It was for some sick emotional appeal) Nothing excuses what he has done. Nothing. The plot twist with Odin was just random. WTF? How? How did he survive? Doesn't matter. He manipulated Thor and will likely manipulate everyone else in the next movie. Loki is a bad guy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good sequel.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THOR: THE DARK WORLDAs sequels go, I was expecting this to be quite bad... but to be honest, I liked it as much as the original movie.The movie is about Jane Foster. Jane was the love interest in the original movie and she has now been hot with something that has given her a strange power. Thor returns to Earth to protect her from the evil Dark Elves.This is a very worthy sequel. It was made after the Avengers Assemble, so if you are going to watch these movies in order, then watch the original Thor, then the Avengers Assemble and then this.The story is really good. I like the way that Jane has got more involved in the fight this time around. Thor takes her up to Asgard to protect her so most of the movie is set up there. As I have stated in the original review, the vision of Asgard is so colourful and beautiful so I was happy that a lot more of the movie was set up there.As before, the effects were very good and the fighting scenes were great. The action was a lot of fun and kept you glued to the screen.The main thing I didn't like about this film was how quickly Thor had forgiven Loki for what he had done. Thor needs his help and understand that, but he should never forgive him for destruction and death he has caused in the last 2 movies. It just didn't feel right.The movie stars Chris Hemsworth, Natalie Portman, Anthony Hopkins, Tom Hiddleston and Christopher Eccleston. The acting seemed better in this movie than the last one. It was great to see Christopher in this. I have always liked him and thought he did a great job in this.The make-up looked great too... the creatures looked really creepy and fit in really well into the movie.This is a good movie and if you enjoyed the original one then you will like this."Well done, you just decapitated your Grandfather."For more reviews, please like my Facebook page:https://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204?ref=hl</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Strong, Fantasy-Powered Alternative to the Avenger Family Standard</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Continuing the second phase of Marvel's cinematic onslaught, begun several months prior with Iron Man 3, Thor's encore solo performance is a markedly stronger, more focused effort than his first. Though Earth still factors into the mix, particularly in the clever, gripping climactic fight scene, there's no mistaking that this is Asgard's story and that clear emphasis, missing from the original, makes a big difference. As a distinctly fantasy-laden epic, it also benefits from a fresh, authentic flavor that its stable-mates just can't match. There's more to see than smashed skyscrapers and flattened taxi cabs in Thor's world, and that brand of open possibility makes the realm an absolute delight to swallow up. As visual feasts go, this is at or near the top of the pile - it's gorgeous, innovative and generally unlike anything else in modern cinema, a stuffed bagful of sensory treats. The acting, too, has taken a grand step up since our last trip across the rainbow bridge. Surprisingly, this time Natalie Portman comes across as a clunky third wheel: Chris Hemsworth and Tom Hiddleston provide the real intrigue, hammering home Thor's complicated relationship with his conniving adopted brother, Loki. A fantastically imaginative flick, well-paced and triumphantly acted, that does something its precursor couldn't: whet my appetite for a sequel.</fullReview>

Born suddenly, and if so then how?

		<shortDescription>The Dark World Comes Up Just Short</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>--WARNING: There may be some spoilers ahead for those who haven't seen the film, so just a heads up. In order to accurately review this film, it may be necessary to talk about some key moments.--Oh, Thor. Thor had won me over with his first feature film. I'd never been a particularly big fan and actually had wasted effort in staying away from the comics as they had zero appeal to me growing up (queue Aquaman here as well). Yet in someway I got around to watching Thor, and here I am having just finished the sequel due to that enjoyable experience...I feel let down, but not angsty or bitter; more or less cheated.Now before going any further I feel it necessary to state that this is a good movie, dare I say a great movie; but I feel some fair warning is needed for those who are unfamiliar with the original film released a few years back. First off, this is not an easy movie to watch if you have not seen the original, and it is very much so a sequel. Second, those who wrote it where clearly aware of the expectations some currently popular actors are now facing as their careers grow. Those who have seen a spike in attention and or have begun to harness a more promising future since the first film's release have seen their roles grow in this film, yet unfortunately to a less organic and much more forced standard. And lastly, it is a blockbuster, much less that of an Iron Man or Avengers blockbuster, and a lot more like what could be considered the bottom rung of the finer Marvel adaptations.With that being said, the story is more or less an episodic occurrence of events that serve as a jumping off point to reunite Thor with Natalie Portman's character, and everything else more or less exists as a way to utilize the popularity of Loki as much as possible. It's not to the point where the film should've been called "Loki: The Dark World", but the actual villain is largely forgettable, and the franchise would've most likely benefited more from creating a film centered around a brotherly conflict, rather than make it seem like they're beating around the bush to facilitate tension. It ends up feeling like those involved didn't know how to make the complicated relationship between Thor and Loki exist in a stand alone way, when several original ideas would've been better than the more generic approach they had taken: *Spoiler* Someone dies, Thor and Loki share an interest, Thor and Loki team up...been there dudes *end spoiler*.It just make you want to roll your eyes rather than go 'Yes! I've been waiting for this'. A surprise isn't even needed for this to be a good film, but given the caliber of comic book adaptations these days, I feel like this film was treated much more like a cash in than a genuine attempt to make a great film like its many other marvel contemporaries.No other conflicts or relationships seem really worth mentioning cause no one else ends up feeling even moderately important; they're all just comedy relief in a story that doesn't even feel serious often enough to warrant that. Also, you will see the twist coming from a mile away, and yes it reeks of this cash-in I previously spoke of. It's a beautiful film which goes without saying, as it is easily one of the nicer ones to look at; but to recommend this movie you'd need to be a fan first and foremost. It's fun, but it's fleeting, and it's most likely going to be the more forgettable Thor film in due time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A different, better and more confident film than the original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fresh from his "New York" gig (The Avengers), we have the second solo instalment for the man god with the Hammer, "Thor" (Chris Hemsworth).Back on his home world Asgar, his brother "Loki" (Tom Hiddleston) is languishing in a cool "Apple style" prison, whilst Thor and his merry band mop up the last few elements of unruliness. This will ensure the nine realms live happily ever after, under the benign rule of "Odin" (Anthony Hopkins) and his much loved wife Frigga (Rene Russo).Meanwhile in an ancient flashback we get acquainted with Aether, a very dark power the Dark Elve warriors "Kursed", led by Malekith (Christopher Eccleston) are keen to get their hands on. They are frustrated in this endeavour by the armies of Asgard, led by "Bor", Odin's father from many thousands of years ago.Back on Earth, Astrophysicist "Jane" (Natalie Portman) is led by her intern "Darcy" (Kat Dennings), equipped with her own PA, to an abandoned warehouse where objects appear to act oddly, disappearing to another dimension when dropped from a staircase.Separating from the group, Jane is suddenly teleported to another realm as you do and becomes possessed by the ancient super weapon Aether, an easy mistake to make whilst out taking a stroll.Concerned for Jane's safety, after being alerted to her plight by Fandral (Idris Elba), Thor brings Jane to Asgard. It is obvious her presence in Asgard is dangerous, as it lures the Kursed like a moth to the light, or darkness to the Aether. Following events, Thor is obliged to trust Loki and Fandral to find a way to leave Asgard against his fathers wishes, leading to an attempt to trick Melkith and destroy the Aether.Can Loki be trusted, is the fate of the world's safe, will the foretold alignment of all nine realms lead to a cataclysmic event, all good comic book questions to answer.The film is an obvious upgrade from the original film with a budget to match, Hemsworth and Hiddleston play their parts with consummate ease and obvious glee. Hemsworth retaining his almost Shakespearean style of delivery, which remains a source of amusement to the audience but is largely accepted by the earth bound characters. Both lead actors star wattage is much higher than before and clearly are enjoying every scene and one-liner. It is now difficult to imagine either part being played by other actors.As before, the film seemingly represents a hybrid of earlier movies, stealing like a hyperactive magpie from new Star Wars and Lord of the Rings. Occasionally the slim story and movie Macguffin (Aether) is exposed and the film skirts close to Game of Thrones (GOT) without the sex and gore. All huge throne rooms, fabulous cities and dark portentous events hanging over proceedings. Director Alan Taylor, previously directed 6 GOT episodes which may explain the similarities.However, if you treat the film as pure entertainment, as you should, there is much fun to be had. Buoyed by the lead actors having a blast and not taking themselves too seriously. However Hopkins looks somewhat uncomfortable, perhaps not getting the "do not take this too seriously memo" and Rene Russo gets little to do. However gate keeper Elba, obviously a much bigger star than before, gets his role beefed up accordingly.Back on earth, Stellan Skarsgard as a scientist helping Jane, gets ready for his "Nymphomaniac" Lars Von Triers directed role, by spending much of the time in a state of undress or in an institution, presumably the pay was good. Portman, understandably performing heroine in distress duties most of the time still manages to be attractive, strong and vulnerable as required. We also get a brief cameo from Chris O'Dowd as Jane's prospective boyfriend post Thor, good luck with that endeavour.There is plenty of humour to puncture the preposterousness of a man/god with a big hammer smashing stuff up, which is almost a pre-requisite in our post-modern, self referential movie world.Watch out for two post credit sequences, a neat cameo and of course Stan Lee, all now well established Marvel studio trademarks.Summary A different, better and more confident film than the original and continues to expand the Thor universe in an interesting way.Hemsworth and Hiddleston are on fine form, if you like comic book superhero films with state of the art effects and enjoyable characters, this will do very nicely.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Welcome Addition to "Phase 2" to the Marvel Cinematic Universe!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Last summer's "Iron Man 3" turned out to be very disappointing, but "Thor: The Dark World" does a much better job of kicking off this second phase of Marvel movies. I did enjoy the first "Thor", but this movie does a much better job of exploring some of the other worlds and raising the stakes.The original cast returns for this second film and they are great! Chris Hemsworth is still a great Thor and Tom Hiddleston really gets a chance to shine as Loki. Natalie Portman is still hot and plays a good Jane Foster. The rest of the original cast is good, also, though I really wish that Kat Dennings was not in these movies because she's annoying and pretty pointless. Christopher Eccleston is Malekith, the new villain for the film. He's a bit boring and is honestly pretty forgettable, which is a shame because Eccleston really is a good actor.The story for this movie is very fun. No, it doesn't always make sense, but like other successful Marvel movies, it keeps you entertained and wanting more. The film also does a much better job at foreshadowing "Avengers 2" than "Iron Man 3" did, so that's an added bonus that all fans should look forward to.The effects are sort of hit and miss. Asgard and the other realms that are shown look spectacular. The action sequences are well choreographed and make for an exciting time. But some of the costumes look a bit silly and fake.Final verdict: "Thor: The Dark World" is exactly what it is meant to be. It is an entertaining thrill ride from start to finish, with good characters and great, action packed scenes. It is not a great Marvel movie like "Iron Man" or "The Avengers", but it is a worthy entry that will leave you entertained and wanting to see it again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A vast improvement, but with a lot of room left for more</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First and foremost, I am sad to say that the sequel did not top the original as thoroughly as has been put forth as a general consensus. If anything, they have used elements from the first Thor and simply added a new villain. But, that is breaking it down to its very core element and does not do the film justice. As is expected with big budget superhero movies these days, the special effects were simply flawless and beautiful. The sound guys also worked their magic. The actors (reprising and new) did a terrific job pulling us into the fictional "Earth", Asgard, and Svartalfheim. Thor, Jane, Odin, Loki, and all the lead characters impress just like they did in 2011. As the baddies, Malekith and his Dark Elves are quite a force to be reckoned with. They were not the types to have a nice meal with. And I liked that quite a lot. Thor was challenged and almost killed on multiple occasions instead of defeating them with a swing and a shock. And Kurse? Now that's a right-hand man a tough baddie like Malekith needs! The fight of the century between him and Hulk would rake in chests upon chests. The little fusses I made for its duration added up, however. For example, Loki's body was simply left behind by Thor. Of course, we discover later that Loki was not killed, but is it not an insult to not bring Loki back to Asgard? And there was a lot of unnecessary dialog intended to pass off as comic relief, but was only obtuse. Things like, "I better get my pants." And why would the students in the library not have run away like the rest of their peers right outside when Malekith's ship crashed down instead of making Thor's fight a big celebrity photo shoot? Finally, some of the scenes were not needed, like Selvig's nude terrorism story on the news being shown twice and the double history lesson that could have been summarized into one that was slightly shorter. All in all, entertainment at every step. Watched 04/23/2014, written 04/24/2014.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This Movie Could Have Been Great But Sadly It's.....Low-Key</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To be truly honest there were a lot of neat elements and scenes in this movie, however they were bogged down by several other groan-worthy elements. First let me point out that I thought that Thor (2011) was one of the more impressive of the recent Marvel movies, mostly because of my liking of Norse mythology (no matter how Hollywood-ized it may be). Going into the theater I expected a great movie, though I had some small doubts deep within myself after seeing Avengers. Let me first start with what was good:- Tom Hiddleston once again steals the show with his top-notch performance as Loki. Thankfully I was glad to see that they once again made him an in-depth character instead of a one-dimensional cliché boring villain like he was in Avengers. - The scenes taking place in the Nine Realms were really breathtaking and unique, I commend the art department for their world design. - A lot of the action scenes (outside of Earth) were well choreographed and directed, with enough elements to keep things interesting. - The dynamic between Thor and Loki was particularly interesting in this movie, and I was glad that it went beyond "I hAtez yoi for-eva cause you waz da bad gui in Avengers".- The villains had an interesting dark ascetic too them, almost a strange medieval Gothic mixed with HR Giger and just a splash of Elder Scrolls daedra. At first their "Teletubbie" masks were a bit distracting to me, but over time I sort of ignored it for the sake of the movie.Now then, we shall unfortunately go onto the elements that brought the movie down (at least for me):- The constant Avengers references got old really quickly, I mean REALLY quickly. Yes we get it, the Avengers happened, now can you please shut up about New York and focus on the current bad guys?- A majority of the Earth scenes were slow, boring, dull, and took away screen time from the rest of the film. Perhaps the English tourism council paid Marvel tons of money just to film a majority of the scenes at famous landmarks in England.- Jane and the scientists, to me, REALLY bogged this movie down and took away precious time that could be given to other more interesting characters. The constant cussing science assistant and goofy "were are my pants" jokes got old pretty quickly.- Not harp on Anthony Hopkins, but his portrayal of Odin felt somewhat "phoned in". Almost during the entire movie he looked bored and detached, perhaps it could just be the writing and script though.- The main dark-elf villain, Malekith the Accursed, seemed to have something lacking to his character. This however is true for most villains in Marvel movies, seems like DC movies get all the well developed villains....- The final battle and climax! Oh goodness, I could not take that seriously whatsoever. I mostly blame the lame "paradox" gimmicks and the fact that it was taking place *SPOILERS* in the middle of an English university where a bunch of uniformed British students are hanging out by the library windows saying "By golly! That's bloody daft right there!".In conclusion I would say that if you want to watch this movie, give it a try, but don't expect a great movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The worst of the best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After the release of "The Avengers" in 2012, Marvel entered what has been called the second wave of their films. The second wave contained sequels to films from the first wave, including "Iron Man 3", "Captain America: The Winter Soldier" and "Thor: The Dark World". Critically, "Thor" from 2011 did better than "Thor: The Dark World", but when it comes to the general moviegoers, they seemed to prefer the sequel over the original. "Thor: The Dark World" is the film that I suspect most people wanted the first "Thor" to be, a fun superhero-fantasy adventure featuring the hammer-wielding god. In those terms, the film succeeds and is decent, but of all the good Marvel films, it is the worst one.Taking place after "The Avengers", Thor (Chris Hemsworth) has returned to Asgard with Loki (Tom Hiddleston). Thor soon learns that the Convergence, an alignment of the Nine Realms which will create portals between all of the realms, is going to occur soon. On earth, the girl Thor formed a relationship with in the first film, Jane Foster (Natalie Portman), is infected by a red mist called Aether. Thor brings Jane to Asgard to help her, resulting in an attack on Asgard by Malekith (Christopher Eccleston), a dark elf who wants the Aether for himself.The film's plot is so overly complex with magical and scientific gobbledygook that even with the help of websites to remember exactly what happened, I'm sitting here wondering if I explained it correctly. While the portals between realms and all of the magical powers in this film give for some fun action sequences, the film is still left a complicated mess that will leave you wondering whether or not you just are not smart enough to understand or if the film was just not smart enough to pull off what it was trying. I'm going with the latter on this one.Compared to the other Marvel movies, "Thor: The Dark World" had the least effect on the cinematic world that these films are based in or on the characters in them. The first wave of films led up to "The Avengers", which helped change Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) in "Iron Man 3", and helped change the world the films are based in in "Captain America: The Winter Soldier". In this case, "Thor: The Dark World" is a film where Thor just goes around, fights some monsters and dark elves with his hammer, and saves the day. Granted, the Aether will probably do something in an upcoming Marvel movie, but that could be way down the line in "Thor 7: Filing Asgard's Taxes". In the case of this film, there are no immediate effects to either the characters or the world.While "Iron Man 3" also relied on an overuse of humor, "Thor: The Dark World" takes it up to the Nth degree. It feels like there were two writers for the film, one who was told it was a superhero movie and the other was told it was a comedy movie. Then, both of them worked together and created a script that was half superhero and half comedy. The comic relief was welcomed every now and then, and some of the comedic elements were very humorous, but after a while, it started to get stale. A lot of the characters were made overly-witty and the expansion of Darcy (Kat Dennings) and the addition of her assistant Ian (Jonathan Howard) were comedic relief that went on too long and were sometimes given precedence over the story, sort of like the raccoon, hummingbird, and dog in "Pocahontas".While there were a lot of problems with the film, there were still some good elements to it. It was nice to see many of the characters again, including the always changing Loki (and I don't mean in appearance). Lady Sif (Jaimie Alexander) is another character I was excited to see again, who I believe was criminally underused in this film. I was hoping they would explore the love triangle between her, Thor, and Jane, but that never occurred. It was nice getting to see the all-seeing Heimdall (Idris Elba) a larger role this time around and the performance from Anthony Hopkins of Odin was superb.As I said before, the plot can be frustrating at times, but what it sets up makes for some fun action sequences and getting to see some cool worlds. The film also includes a good musical score."Thor: The Dark World" takes "The Avengers" spot in my opinion as the worst of the best Marvel movies. Its overly complex plot makes little sense and there is no immediate effect on the world or characters, but it is a fun ride with some occasional good humor and it does let us see some of our favorite characters from another realm.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Superman meets Star Trek</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My review is essentially the same as the one I posted for the first Thor movie. It is utterly preposterous; it is hard to follow and the "otherworldly" places look phony. Why such a high rating, then? I would've actually have given it a 10 if not for two detracting things: one is that it is too long, with a few fight scenes too many. Yes, we get it; Thor is mighty; the CGI artists are mighty; but these points were made over and over since the opening scene so at the end it seemed to drag.The second detraction is for the asinine comical touches provided by Jane's sidekick Darcy, which are too disruptive to the point where they take you out of the film's universe and into the land of sitcom. These problems aside, all the rest plays beautifully. The blending of myth and science fiction worked very well - it was "Superman meets Star Trek" because not only did Thor's might save the universe, so did scientists with their technobabble and gizmos. As to the characters - simplistic, yes, but they outdid themselves compared with the first film. Hemsworth did an excellent job not just providing muscle-bound good looks but was able to capture the angst of the "Superman" character, torn between duty and his love for a mortal; and Loki's strange combination of despicable yet pitiful was "off the charts." (SPOILER - when Thor visits Loki in prison, Loki at first maintains the visual illusion that all is well with him. Then he drops the illusion, and the sight of what he has become is cringe-inducing). Portman, playing Jane, was at time dangerously verging on a "sitcom" rendering of the love interest, yet could carry off the role of someone smart and brave in additional to being, of course, gorgeous.As to the story line - yes, absolute preposterous junk, but anyone watching a movie based on comic books knows that going into it; even with some plot twists and turns, it is never in doubt that "good will triumph." Still, I highly recommend this film - with its excellent portrayal of stock characters, the moodiness of the "universe," and the incredible special effects, this is "dumb fun" with the highest possible production standards.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Came for Thor, Got a little More</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>MINOR Spoilers; Nothing on what happened, just some scenes I wasn't a reader of the comic books. I didn't get to adore Thor till I saw the film. So being a "newbie" (as I bet most comic book geeks would label me) I felt that Thor: The Dark World was the first of the films that was a little too concerned with shifting the universe smoothly from its second phase to its third. Don't get me wrong Thor 2 was a fun film to watch, and a good one, but as much as it feels that it picked right up after Thor 1 (or the Avengers, I think that's the correct chronology) there were some character inconsistencies and a patchy ending that felt as though it was putting a band-aid on a gashing cut. The biggest dynamic is the shift of chemistry from Thor's relationship with Jane Foster to Thor's relationship with Loki, that sonovagun Loki. When they team up in the film its hands down the most enjoyable part. Their brotherly banter, with Loki as the nagging little brother and Thor as the "shut up bro" older brother feels real. The looming question, Is Loki good now, or is he still bad, builds more suspense than the final showdown between Thor and the bad guy. Tom Hiddleston kills the role. As long as Loki remains a big of a part to the universe, we'll be seeing him in future "Top 10 Villains of all Times" lists. Apparently the ritual sacrifice to holy brotherhood was the love story of Jane Foster played by cutie pie, Natalie Portman. Bottom line is that a love scene would have kept the romance interesting (and the film PG-13). Thor and Jane Foster's relationship was a big reason why the first film was so good. The notion that Thor wasn't able to see her ever again was the biggest question I wanted to see answered in The Dark World. Despite the bi-frost being totally destroyed in Thor 1, Thor is sailing from realm to realm (apparently for two years) kicking ass and taking names before he casually plops on Earth to see Jane. Common girlfriend line, "Where were you my superhero hunk? You never called" is answered with, " Babe, I was too busy making sure the realms were free of ugly creatures." I wasn't a fan of how they "band-aided" that situation, and I wasn't a fan of the romance-less between the two. I think they kiss twice, and one of those times is in a post-credit scene. Our Earthlings, Darcy, Eric Selvig, and a new intern, are really, really un-interesting: the worst part is they play a part in the resolution. Selvig's dive from the responsible moral voice in the first film to "running around naked in public" crazy scientist is one of the easier character inconsistencies to spot. Darcy's a bunch of one-liners. Chris O' Dowd (cop from Bridesmaid) plays an earthling interested in Jane Foster, but he's really there to set up a jealousy quip by Thor. Ironically these earthlings feel more like aliens than the Asgards. The gatekeeper is still awesome. Thor's fighting sequences are still awesome. Odin is still awesome, although a bit meaner and questionable in his choices (character inconsistency #2). We all agree Loki is awesome. The humorous, relaxed feeling that we get from all the Marvel Universe films (except Hulk) is awesome. A touch of Star Wars is awesome. Essentially The Dark World delivers on the promise that it's going to be just as entertaining as the original. However it's too concerned with progression of the cinematic universe that it forgets Thor is what we picked to watch. You'll realize this in the end if you truly think about how the "twists" are actually cliffhangers to set up what's next. The patching to go along with a forgettable villain that's almost an illusion to distract us makes this a downgrade from the original, but it's another day another adventure in the Marvel Cinematic Universe and that's always worth watching. 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great sequel and a great addition to this universe.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought with Avengers 2 coming up I would rewatched Thor 2 and even though I didn't enjoy it as much as the first time I saw it it is still a great film and a great addition to this universe. The premise of this film sees the dark elves return to cover the universe in darkness using an old weapon. Thor, Jane foster and an unlikely ally attempt to stop the elves dark plan. Chris Hemsworth is well known for his role as Thor and he is great in the role and is a hero who I think can be loved by everybody. The supporting cast is a bit of a mixed bag, Tom Hiddleston returns as Loki and he is great in this film and really adds allot to the film. His chemistry with hemsworth is great and he is one villain that interests the audience. Anthony Hopkins is back as Odin and he is great in the role as the dad figure and wise figure even though he is also a little flawed in the film. I think ever since the star wars prequels Natalie Portman has struggled and she just didn't really fit in this or text first film and their relationship doesn't really have any feel to it or believability. Also Christopher Eccleston plays the head of the dark elves but I felt like he was underused and completely forgettable, which wasn't helped by the appearance of Loki. There was some interesting relationships in the film and some of the story felt well done. However, character motivations aren't revealed and the overall execution of the story feels weak. The script was really good with there being some good humour in the film and also the drama really worked in the film and helped make this film great. The style of the film was great, with all the action scenes being really good and the cgi of asgard looking better in this film. Overall I really like this film and think it is a great comic book film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Thor: The Dark World was superfluous movie. I watched it merely to continue advancing the plots of all of the Marvel films, so that I will not be behind for the highly anticipated Avengers 2. Once again, Jane Foster (Natalie Portman), an ordinary denizen finds herself in the midst of an intergalactic crisis. The improbabilities continue as she miraculous seems to have all answers to all of the perilous situations that she winds up in.The biggest highlight of the film was Tom Hiddleston's portrayal of the ever-charismatic Loki. Time and time again, I asked myself where were all of the other avengers and superheroes that exist in that universe. As with all Marvel films, there were two "secret" endings during the credits, which was a delight and an enigma together.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay, so another Marvel comic flick. The sequel of 2011 Thor movie and the avengers. Would serve as a prequel to next Avengers movie. A super-hero movie about the demi-god, his brother Loki, his father Odin and the Asgardians. And yes, the audience get to see Jane (played by Portman), doctor Selvig and friends from London. The movie contains lot of special effects that are good esp. the fight scene at the climax. Loki was better among the main characters in this movie, while others here are bad. The villain Kurse was cool. All the other characters are so much under-developed and superficial. The script could've been way better. The teleport scene was a disappointment. Except for CGI, I disliked the entire movie. Still watchable just once, if you are a die-hard marvel comic fan.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A worthy, if not slightly weaker installment in the Marvel film franchise.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Thor: The Dark World" is the Marvel film that made me realize the element of the franchise's success. It's the movie's preference to not take themselves too seriously. Sure, there's still good character development and drama, but the movies still know that the premise is nothing that serious, and manages to have fun with itself, and in the process, lets the audience get in on that fun too. They are as much fun too laugh at as they are to be entertained. Despite not reading any of the comics, I liked the first "Thor" movie, so I looked forward to seeing this one. This movie takes place in London (a decision I find pointless, but that's just me). Jane Foster, while awaiting the return of Thor, discovers that she's possessed by a mystical element known as the ether. Because of this, a group of dark elves from the titular dark world, are sent out to kidnap Jane and use the ether's power to rule the world. Now it's up to Thor to stop the elves, all the while trying to decide what to do about his brother, Loki. Something I find that the film does a very good job at is telling a three-act story. The first third of the movie reintroduces as to all of our favorite characters, and the dilemmas that they're all facing. None of it is boring, and I was content in seeing where it would be going. Unfortunately, the second act doesn't shine as much. After Thor saves Jane, he takes her back to his home world, Asgard. Here, we take in the lavish art direction by John Bush, almost reminding me of the "Ave Maria" sequence from Fantasia. And yet, I still feel bored. This goes on for awhile. It finally starts to pick itself up during a well paced fight scene between the asgardians and the dark elves, and, without giving too much away, someone dies. One of the other characters had previously built up drama between them, leading to some actual drama. And finally, the final act gives us practically what we want. A great final battle, well paced action, and plenty of brushed on humor. "Thor:The Dark World" is a worthy, if not weaker, edition of the Marvel film franchise. The plot is very engaging, the comic relief for the most part is very funny, and as always, the action scenes are some of the best I've ever seen. It's proof that the movies still like to have fun with their premise, like any good action movie should.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Aether awakens us. The convergence returns." OMG. How bad can this get? "The walls between worlds will become almost non-existent. Physics is gonna go ballistic. Increases and decreases in gravity. Spatial extrusions. The very fabric of reality is gonna be torn apart." OMG!!! That's how bad it's gonna get. OK, so the dialogue is pretty awful - although there are a few fun one-liners. And the Norse god Thor is not my favourite super-hero - too much like "The Lord Of The Rings" meets "Star Wars".But I find it hard to resist any super-hero movie and Chris Hemsworth (the eponymous hammer-wheeling man from Asgard) went up in my opinion with his performance in "Rush", I'm always ready to view a movie with Natalie Portman (an actress with a Harvard psychology degree who delivers that line about "the fabric of reality"), and I enjoyed seeing the scenes in my home city of London (although my friends in Greenwich will wonder why that was the centre of the convergence and a joke about Thor using the London Underground to return to Greenwich overlooks the fact that Greenwich is not actually served by the Underground). And the special effects are wonderful.Marvel movies have a habit of offering a teaser clip at the end of the credits and this time we are treated to two: one mid credits and one at the very end. So it is clear that this second outing for Thor in his own film will not be the last in the ever-growing universe of the Marvel film franchise</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well... this is boring as anything. I didn't like the first one either, and this was no improvement. Natalie Portman is terrible, Anthony Hopkins delivers one of his laziest performances, the visual effects are entirely unconvincing, the direction is workmanlike and shows Alan Taylor's TV roots, and it's impossible to care about anything that happens because it's all so shallow and dull. The mix of windy, stagey pronouncements and fish-out-of-water comedy really doesn't work, in part because Asgard is a garish, campy and distractingly artificial set of green-screened backdrops and too much of London is shot like the establishing shots in a bog-standard sitcom, and in part because the dialogue isn't good enough at either end of the rainbow bridge.When Tom Hiddleston and Stellan Skarsg?rd are on screen the movie goes up a gear (from soporific to ever-so-mildly engaging) and there are a few funny moments (Stan's cameo, Thor hanging his hammer on a peg, the scene on the underground) but in the main I'd had enough after about ten minutes.The attached short with Ben Kingsley was a hoot, though. I enjoyed the heck out of that.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>...which doesn't say much. For all it's impressive visuals (and it had a few), it's still the characters and story I'm hoping to appreciate. A stunning environment means nothing if the characters are as likable as yesterday's garbage. So... I'll go into the characters since the story is too easy to go through.Malekith - sorely underused, in lots of ways. I hoped for a menacing Dark Elf that would intimidate our dear Asgardians, and really push them towards the wall. Instead, he came off as a semi-tired Dark Lord who really, really wanted his shiny toy that would enable him to wipe out everything into darkness unless of course, someone just happens to be able to stop him. Kurse was far more intimidating than him.Thor - If he is supposed to play the "royal" prince of Asgard, and no emotions whatsoever otherwise (unless Loki makes him angry), then he did a good job. He's a protector, nothing more, nothing less, again, unless Loki riles him up - shame he went down to Earth.Jane &amp; her mortal sidekicks - Good God. Even Selvig wasn't worth watching in this movie. All of them really was just there, stealing screen time. Romantic interest Jane is insufferable, she still haven't developed a character beyond pining for Thor - is this the reason miss Portman is bored with her role (not very challenging) or does she just doesn't care?. Just get rid of them, already. I swear, if that blasted "romance" survives in Thor 3, then I'm done.Odin - Oh, he was in the movie? Yes, now I remember him.. he waved a spear and killed a Dark Elf, told Loki off and argued with Thor.Loki - Someone who actually seemed to enjoy his role. Can't say I blame him, when you gets to be the guy that likes to push the buttons of everyone else. It doesn't bode well when the semi-villain is the most (if not only) interesting character in the movie, but since he was around, I could watch from start to finish. He had the mockery, the anger, and the illusions to make it interesting. And well, besides the fact that he actually bothered to breathe a little "life" into his character.What else is there to say... Frigga and Sif, as little as we got from them, was good enough. Credit to Frigga for being a kick-ass character and to Sif for sticking to business. The Warriors three was underused, the Dark Elves (sans Kurse) were boring, and I could care less about everyone from the Earth who filled no purpose but to to offer a timely solution to all the problems or talk about Jane's romance with Thor. Loved the Captain America cameo.But still, better than Thor 1. Thanks Loki.</fullReview>

Thor takes her to Asgard and Odin finally reveals what all this is about. The evil Elves who want this force invade Asgard and close all exit portals trapping the gods. By using this force, the Aether, they can destroy the universe and let nothingness rule. That forces Thor and his sidekicks to join forces with the imprisoned Loki. But can they trust Loki? Long CGI carnage ensues between the Asgardians and the Elves, Loki, Thor and the main villain. It's no mystery who wins the battle. We get several instances of Asgardian politics- Thor's insecurity of being the ruler, Loki's ambition, and Odin's wisdom. At the end we're left with...questions to be answered by part 3 I guess.Thor I was beautiful, captivating, fascinating, visually and story-wise. Thor II just falls flat. Almost entirely without charm, it teaches us nothing new about the Norse world. Relationships don't matter here all that much and Loki gets slapped by some girl. It took 3 writers to come up with this weak story that's just there to justify hundreds of millions wasted in dull CGI battles. And what better way to ruin a good thing than by hiring a director with near zero experience in movies and hand him the (formerly) strongest of the superhero franchises so far. Thor II is disappointment. These movies have gone into industrial mode, are being cranked out by the dozen now without regard to quality, anyone who's got time is hired to direct. A shame, but typical greedy cynical Hollywood behavior. Hopefully someone who actually cares will take control of Thor III before they start hiring rappers and Bruce Willis to act, try to sell us some lame soundtrack, and let Thor become a copy of Transformers 8.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"When do we get started?"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After "The Avengers", Thor is back in Asgard; however, a new threat arrives that is much older and more powerful than he ever imagined. Thor will take on a journey both dangerous and personal, and he may team up with some people he never would have imagined he would do so.Where Kenneth Branagh's introduction to Thor was a charming, cheesy, even campy fish-out-of- water type of comic book film, Alan Taylor's "The Dark World" is tonally, visually, and thematically a different type of film, on a much bigger scale than the relatively low-key first installment. At times it even feels like a sci-fi war movie. On a positive note, it seemed just as grandiose and big as the first one but in a different way. Plus, I enjoyed the character development and interaction between Thor and Loki. They were interesting characters, and I wanted to see their progress as brothers after "The Avengers". Tom Hiddleston as Loki is a show stealer; he delivers such great lines with such a great delivery that it's hard not to enjoy. My one issue with the character arc is that when he's brought back to live in the end (disguised as Odin), I have many thoughts about this: how did he live? How did he come back to Asgard? Where is Odin? Is he alive or dead? I wish that was explored more.I also like the mother. She played a more substantial role in being both nurturing and able to stand her ground. When she died, I legitimately felt sadness in seeing a great character pass away. The funeral scene was also very well done and shot. Another positive note was the comic relief characters (the humans) being somewhat tolerable in this one than in the first one. Some scenes with them are annoying, but some (especially the ending) is well done that I really enjoyed their performance.However, my problems with the movie are two things: one is the villain and the other is the actual dark world. For me, the villain was weak and forgettable. Even though Loki was kind of weak in the first Thor movie, he grew on me. This villain is so forgettable and uninspiring that I forgot what he looked like, as well as his motive being very underwhelming. Secondly, the Dark World, a world that has been built up and is in the title of the movie, is so generic and bland that it could've been called anything else.On the whole, it's got problems and issues with the villain, and it's location. However, as a fun comic book movie, it's very enjoyable. I think this is better than the first one because the stuff I enjoyed from the first one is expanded in this movie whilst the things I didn't like from the first movie are either tossed to the side or not brought up that often. It's a fun movie with some problems, but still enjoyable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great return for Thor</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a bit of a Marvel fanatic, I always look forward to their superhero movies. Thor first became a sensation in 2011 when the not too hard on the eye Chris Hemsworth came crashing in with his hammer onto our big screens. I loved the Kenneth Branagh directed movie, which I felt brought a new kind of sophisticated humour rarely seen in the Marvel universe. I was apprehensive about The Dark World as I wondered whether after the smash hit that was the Avengers in 2012 if Thor could stand of his own accord again, without the help of other superheroes. Because lets face it, Thor (although pretty to look at) is in my opinion a little boring compared to the other Avengers. It was his interaction with the other characters in the Avengers that made him stand out.But it works.Thor The Dark World plays to Thor's strengths, the strengths that made him stand out in the Avengers, which is his interactions with those around him. In Thor The Dark World we get to see more of my favourite brotherly love. Thor and Loki (played by the fantastic Tom Hiddleston) were again the stars of the show. Their relationship kept me glued to the screen and their interaction with each other was simply magical. The twist of the two brothers working together to avenge a family death meant that we begin to see how complicated the brothers relationship is. I think that this development in the brothers relationship is pivotal to the success of this movie and certainly left me wanting more of both Thor and Loki.The plot involves Thor again enlisting the help of his favourite humans, Jane Foster (Natalie Portman), Eric Selvig (Stellan Skarsgard) and Darcy (Kat Dennings) to save the universe from a new threat. The evil dark elf Malekith (Christopher Eccleston) is determined to plunge the universe into eternal darkness so that he may rein supreme. Christopher Eccleston does an good job with what I feel is a rather limited villain. It is difficult to portray a villain who is barely on screen or who speaks a made up language making it difficult to convey specific emotions. I felt that the movie lost some of the magic from the first films with such a bland villain. It was the presence of Loki (a far superior "bad guy") that saved the movie for me.I can overlook certain aspects that made me cringe. Zachary Levi whom is a fantastic actor and one of my personal favourites, had the most ridiculous accent which caused me physical embarrassment whenever I heard him speak. Some of the humour I felt was forced, I never again want to be subjected to Stellan Skarsgard running naked through Stonehenge. The humour in the movie was at it's best when Loki returned.Personally, despite the under developed villain and the desperate attempts at humour, I loved this movie. I think I am justified in saying my enjoyment was mainly down to Tom Hiddleston's portrayal of Loki. His performance I cannot fault and without him I feel this movie would have been sorely lacking.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great action, special effects, superhero movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There have been plenty of movies based on classical cartoon superheroes that have been poorly implemented and with a lousy story. Luckily this one is not one of those. This was really a very enjoyable movie and I liked this movie a lot better than the first Thor movie which I felt was mostly silly.This one has a story which was rather okay and held somewhat together. You have to remember that this is a comic book hero and the story is on that level of course. The special effects and the scenery is really nice as well. The views of Asgard is cool, almost breathtaking.Anthony Hopkins was excellent as Odin or Oden has he is called in Sweden, my country of birth. Tom Hiddleston is also very good in his role although I have to say that I really do not like his role but then he is supposed to be one of the bad guys so? Chris Hemsworth is good enough in his role but I would say that he is really the weakest ones in terms of acting.The movie is liberally sprinkled with jokes as well and, thankfully, most of them are not too bad. Although a bit silly I have to say that I did laugh when Thor politely hung Mjölnir on the clothes rack in the apartment with Darcy and Dr. Selvig.On the whole I enjoyed this movie tremendously.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just want to echo the sentiments of many here... this movie is not good. I loved the first Thor, it was methodical, developed the characters and dosed out the power of Thor and his foes in small and very impressive bites. This leaves you with a healthy understanding of just how powerful and dangerous this fictitious world is.This film dispenses with any sort of sense and throws a ton of visual effects at you hoping you'll be blinded enough to overlook the shoddy script. It didn't work :/. The story gives no depth to any characters, and the only saving grace is it didn't really weaken any established characters from the first film. I don't require much in the way of thought provoking content, but give me something. Action for action's sake is played... and so is the Thor title if they don't turn it around.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Marvel movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The plot of the movie wasn't good; it was a typical marvel movie: the good guy catches or kills the bad guy and gets the girl. The first Thor movie was fine but now the second one is just for the money. I mean it's a marvel movie people will always go even though it might be terrible, they just want to see it because it's a marvel movie. There was not much action in the movie but when there's a fight scene it will be is full of special effects and spectacular so that kids love it. Also Loki is back in the plot, I personally think it's time to let the character go, he's always in the movie as a bad guy but they still trust him and they think he's going to be good again. The movie was just written to make money; it had very little to do with the previous films. It's becoming more of a series, it's just another episode; something changes between Loki and Thor and then they (or only Thor) kill or capture a bad guy. I also think they're completely missing the point, the whole universe is at risk but it's more important that Jane is fine then the whole universe being wiped out. The universe being at risk wasn't really important although I thought that was meant to be the point. For Thor what's so fun about a movie when the lead character is invincible and kills the bad guy in less than a minute. There's a whole movie about the wellbeing of one person who will eventually die and the lead character will still have to live a long time after she passes, but the one thing the movie: the risk of the destruction of the universe is a side-issue.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Thor: The Dark World is a sequel of the Thor movie in 2011, also a follow-up to the cross-over film: The Avengers, and an eight installment in Marvel's Cinematic Universe. Starring Chris Hemsworth (Rush) as Thor, Natalie Portman (Black Swan) as Thor's love interest, Jane Foster, Tom Hiddleston (Midnight in Paris) as the vengeful Loki, Anthony Hopkins as Thor's father, Odin, Christopher Ecclesston as Malekith and Rene Russo as Thor and Loki's mother Frigga. The film was set to release November 8, 2013, yet ahead in the Philippines which was on October 30th.I truly am a GAGA fan of the cinematic universe. How I begged for something like this; films that are interconnected with each other and one day will cross-over in one epic movie and proceed. Marvel Cinematic Universe is the answer to this plea.They have created oneness and interrelated concepts in comic characters like Iron Man (which truly was the best of all franchises), Captain America, Hulk and Thor. They also even managed to expand the world in television and created a spin-off story about the Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. which disappoints fans a bit, but not me.I remembered not liking the first Thor movie due to its long precedence of build-up and little non-satisfying action scenes. And it doesn't differ in Thor: The Dark World.The movie started off with an explanation of Malekith's treason to the Universe with Anthony Hopkins lame voice over. I wasn't INTO IT because there was no intensity in the actor's voice; he was just like a bored story teller and it should've been created with impact since it's the opener of the movie, and it's just infuriating hearing Hopkins lazy on that build-up.And the build-up continues on and on in about an hour out of 112 minutes of the film which bored me to death, not even Frigga's death created much impact.There was a part where Malekith and his gang had already infiltrated Asgard which I also didn't feel the threat due to the fact that there was no build-up on how Malekith would intensify his revenge.The interesting part only exaggerated when (SPOILER, MAJOR SPOILER) Loki died and he battle between Thor and Malekith who acquired the Aether (A dark force in liquid form to extinguish the 9 realms and create darkness) from Jane who had possessed the said element.Yet still the action scenes feel heavy.Although, there were truly funny moments in the film that delights me, since everyone should know that any Marvel Cinematic Universe film would not be possible with no touch of comedy in it. I remember laughing my ass out loud when Loki transformed himself to Captain America that made Chris Evans' uncredited cameo. The comedy lasted throughout the climatic ending, which wasn't even present in the build-up part that lames it all up; not even the amazingly funny Kat Dennings' made an strong laughable moments in the build-up parts (but not in the climax where she and her intern was really funny).So everything sums up to the climax part and the rest of the film was a blah.Thor gave me the impression that there are ups and downs in any cinematic world, and Thor was a down. The action scenes were 'bad' heavy; the build-up was too much that gives a bore; the climatic part wasn't that satisfying; there were no 'HELL YEAH, THAT'S THOR' moment; and there was really nothing to say about the film but disappointment and nothing happened.Thor: The Dark World is directed by Alan Taylor.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sleepy Operatic Second Installment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Of all the current Marvel super heroes who enjoy their own solo films, Thor is my least favourite. I remember going through the whole Greek mythology in grade school and never could get into it. The other turn-off is the focus on yucking it up with the younger characters. Leave the goofy relationship material to television shows. Then there is the decision to turn the great Stellan Skarsgard (I remember him back in "Hunt For Red October") into a humiliating clown character. As an audience member, I was embarrassed for such a high brow film to stoop to such broad comedy gags.There is considerable amount of time spent on other planets to setup all the rivalries and bad guys. The film lacks any punch, as it goes through the confrontations, it all plays out like an extended stage opera. The characters are in their grandiose outfits making grandiose pronouncements. All against large backdrops (yes you can tell it's all CGI). Anthony Hopkins is getting on in his age and his performance lacks fire. Tom Hiddleston, the great baddie from The Avengers, is literally sitting on the sidelines for the whole film.About an hour into watching it on DVD for the second time (the first time I saw it in the theatre I fell asleep three times), I realised the main problem with this movie is the sappy music. The soundtrack is the most boring generic underscoring I have heard in a long time. The music lacks any stingers to grab the audience, no depth in it's arrangements. It is amazing how just one aspect of a film can help kill it. Even when things pick up in the third act as London is ground zero for the big alien invasion. The production values are definitely there (although the 170 million price tag seems a bit much). The direction and editing is also just there, no flare or real energy in the story's momentum.Even though it clocks in at 1 hour 52 minutes, I swear it felt over two hours. I would still recommend this minor installment in the Marvel family of films, but not if you're sleepy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun yet predictable action/superhero movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When the original Thor was released in 2011 It came out in a midst of wondering as to whether it would connect with audiences. Was the public ready to take to an actual hammer wielding God played by a then virtually unknown Australian actor in a setting that seemed ripe for parody? In 2014 the answer is an overwhelming yes with Thor and in a real world sense Chris Hemsworth becoming one of the most popular Marvel screen incarnations but with this popularity comes more expectation. The original Thor was a pleasantly entertaining surprise directed with a stately manner by Brit Kenneth Branagh so how does the sequel match up? The worst thing about Thor: The Dark World is just how achingly predictable the whole plot line is and if it were not for that there is much to enjoy in this sequel that doesn't take itself too seriously and features a rampant pace that is missing in many middling Blockbusters of recent times. Most scenes in the movie feel well paced and edited with barely a moment in between set pieces to catch your breathe. It's perhaps thanks to Game of Thrones mainstay and now Dark World director Alan Taylor that the film plays out in such a manner and produces some at times highly impressive visuals and vistas. With all this highly polished production and behind the scenes wins going back to the story is what makes the movie sadly such a forgettable one.Thor's original casting was a major win in the beginning and again the leads in Hemsworth, Portman, Hiddleston and Hopkins all do a fine job with their respective roles with predictably banter between both Thor and Loki a particular highlight. Eccleston as the lead villain Malekith is sadly a complete non-event with what is perhaps the most lame and uninteresting Marvel screen villain we have yet seen (that is saying something when you look back to The Sandman). In concerns to the story it seems like an afterthought with the melodrama that plays out within it and there is never any real sense of the stakes as the film just doesn't try enough to have that dread that worked so well with the Avengers or even the original Thor.To criticise a story in a Marvel movie may seem trivial but to go with your bang for your buck you want your brain engaged also with a story that feels somewhat fresh and original and sadly despite spectacle and an easy going charm The Dark World misses this mark badly. In saying this characters within the film remain interesting in their own right and with such a brisk pace the film truly never outstays its welcome.3 convenient cave time travel portals out of 5 P.S ? as per usual with a Marvel jaunt make sure your stay through all the credits!

		<shortDescription>Not a patch on the first Thor</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Had been looking forward to this film ever since the first was released.Never read the comics, so basing my like of the first film purely on the direction, humour and lead characters.But fast forward to this film, and what happened ? Okay, Kenneth Branagh was going to be a hard act to follow - but this film just seemed to go for CGI and forget the script.Tom Hiddleston and Chris Hemsworth both carry off what passes as a script - but despite the films title, and ample chances for big combat scenes, there actually isn't much combat.A shame, as I'm normally a fan of Christopher Eccleston - but the evil elf character just didn't cut it as a villain.To my mind, a wasted opportunity for the franchise. With its roots in mythology, the Thor franchise has a rich history of combat and tradition to call upon.Even when Asgard was being attacked, there really wasn't much combat - most centred around CGI flybys..............and when there was combat, it was almost playground stuff, and usually seemed to end with an attacker throwing a grenade thing at the Asgard defenders.So not really much use of Thors combat skills - or unfortunately the hammer.And the end fight wasn't exactly thrilling either. Just Ecclestons elf firing the dark stuff repeatedly at Thor - hardly the stuff of legend that the 'historical' fight sequence would have you believe.The first Thor film was fun, paced and directed well - this film certainly doesn't manage that.Ending leaves it open for another instalment. If Marvel go ahead, I hope they look at what people enjoyed in the first film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I begin by saying in a simple line, this sequel was just okay for me. I did not find any awesomeness in it or any mind blowing scenes. The first movie was quite interested me because of a new actor, new superhero character and the birth of the new franchise from Marvel studio. All together with a mythical Greek character in a modern world, it was something that hit me. Just a few months back, I praised Hemsworth for his best ever performance in the biographical picture 'Rush'. Here he has fallen back to okay kinda performance. The movie was nothing special, but a decent entertainment. Technically, it was rich in visuals with good graphics, no one must dare to doubt it. My problem was the story which followed the usual fantasy movie protocol. One of the disappointment from 2013, completely a commercial purpose behind its creation and production. Yeah, all the movie are but this one is very much visible. So in my opinion, it is one time watch movie.6.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mixed thoughts from someone who loved the first film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A few complaints before I address what worked for me. While I enjoyed it, I felt it didn't have quite the "wow" factor the first film had. The mood throughout is somber, both in look and feel, with the occasional bit of humor (mostly from Kat Dennings). The story is more complex and I'm not of the camp that feels that is always a good thing. Once again, the cast is great although it seems the supporting characters like Sif and The Warriors Three are largely wasted. Odin is especially pompous and unbearable this time around. When you have Thor having to counsel his father on peace not war, it feels at times like this isn't even the same Odin from the first film. Obviously the sci-fi gobbledygook elements will please many. I'm referring to the Aether nonsense and everything surrounding it. It's one of those "shut your brain off to enjoy it" moments for me. Also, Loki's trick of using illusions or impersonating people was used way too much. It made the last time he uses it in the film less effective. The villain Malekith is uncharismatic and, frankly, dull. Finally, the look of the film wasn't my favorite. This is just a stylistic preference but I felt it was too "Lord of the Rings". Everything was muted colors and kind of depressing. The first film was much brighter and felt like more of a superhero movie. Stick with what has worked for you, Marvel. Let DC make their dour superhero films. Keep it bright.OK, now you read all that and you probably wonder how I can say I still enjoyed the film. Well, I loved the performances from Hemsworth and Hiddleston. I also liked Kat Dennings and appreciated how she lightened things up. Natalie Portman had way more to do than the first film and was enjoyable and pretty as usual. While I said I didn't care for the overall dark look of the film, I did admire the special effects. They were very well done, save for the opening scene which was a little too fake with obvious CGI soldiers. Ultimately, I enjoyed it enough but it wasn't one of my favorite Marvel films. Thor is my favorite Marvel superhero and I loved the first movie. I realize a lot of fans are rabid about these films and have a "you either love it or hate it" mentality but I'm in the middle. I liked it but I didn't love it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not great but not terrible either.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The only reason I am writing this review is because the reviews I have seen here are either someone hated it totally or thought it was the best movie they ever saw. The truth is somewhere in the middle, Thor will never be the best movie you ever saw, nor will it be the worst ever, if you think its the worst ever then you haven't seen Dragonball evolution. What can i say about this movie, There was far too much going on to connect with the characters in too short a time.Yet still, the acting scenes and action were solid. The movie just lacked emotional substance, which you would expect from a Thor movie. Things could have been explored a little differently especially when it comes to romance and some other of Thor's relationships including Natalie Portman's character, Jane. There was a lot of one dimensionality to the characters with the exception of Loki. Other than that this movie was solid fun.I would suggest renting it or having it in your DVD collection, for that boring Saturday. It isn't a memorable one but it will wind the time away and give you a few laughs and giggles. That and Thor just kicks BUTT. :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thor The Dark World: Three words: TOO MUCH COMEDY!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Thor: The Dark World. Now with most new movies I review this review may contain SPOILERS so read at your own risk. Thor: The Dark World improves on many flaws of the first Thor, like probably my biggest problem with the first Thor was that the 9 realms were way to polished and neat in this movie the realms look more like actual places that have dirt and muck. And also Asgard looks much more Viking-like and that makes a whole lot of sense considering the Norse mythology was created by Vikings. In this movie Thor got to do more Thor-like things with his power, and be more of a hero. Thor The Dark World also threw in more creatures they all looked pretty cool especially the secondary villain Kurse, he was big, and violent a real Challenger to Thor sadly I felt he didn't get enough screen time. Thats one of the problems with the movie, the villains were really cool but had no were near enough screen time, like Malekith, great design from adapting a comic to a movie, cool powers, good threat, worthy enemy, threatening but in the end he was only on screen for like 17 minutes, I fell they should've cut out parts of the Earth scenes and replaced it with more Malekith and Kurse scenes. On Earth there were two characters in particular that the whole movie could have doe without, the two interns (I know they probably have names but I didn't care enough to remember them) they annoyed the crap out of me, I hated them really took the movie down a notch. But out of the negatives there were some positives that outweighed them, the character of Thor was much more heroic and godlike, Loki's back and he's good in the movie and doesn't overstay his welcome, the fights were great very imaginative especially the final fight with portals and realm jumping. Now some cameos that I noticed of course Stan Lee had one and it was great as all the rest, and the one that's probably the best is a Captain America cameo, I wont tell you when were or how it happens but man it's cool. So in the end Thor: The Dark World is better than the first but this is still a flawed movie, but even with the flaws Thor The Dark World gets an 7.5 out of 10. Stay during and after the credits there's two scenes</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The guy with the big hammer is back! He is still mostly the straight man in a story that mixes Shakespearian family drama with mythical mumbo-jumbo. Mind you, Thor (Chris Hemsworth) and his Asgardian kin are not Gods, because that could cause all sorts of controversy among the believers of various 'legit' religions. The movie takes the Lord of the Rings approach by throwing you right into an epic battle with explanatory voice-over. It introduces the movies villains economically, making no compromises to people who may need a moment to transition from their daily routine to this fantastical world. You'll either have to go with it or just go.In time, you do stop worrying about the plausibility and practical aspects of life in Asgard and the other realms. What becomes more of a problem is some really silly science being used on the earthbound side of the story. The mythical worlds are so far removed from reality that applying credibility seems inappropriate. But hanging a whole lot of gibberish pseudo-science off two fake-looking devices with a dubious- looking remote control , and making the grand finale hinge on the vague workings of it, is annoying. Sure, I can understand that these doohickeys simply do what the script needs them to do, but they are such obvious plot devices that the lazy writing is hard to miss. The writers have some fun by playing around with the effect the thingamajigs cause, and even use it for some good comic relief, but it does throw you out of the story. The writers expose themselves too much as puppet masters.Now, all this makes it sound like I didn't have a good time watching Thor: The Dark World. But it is fun, in a cheesy, over-the-top kinda way. Most of the cast from the first movie is brought back in, including the great Tom Hiddleston as Loki, though I don't quite like how the movie handles him. In-between this movie and The Avengers, he does seem to be spending an awful lot of time hanging around in a cell. And being a trickster, a character you can never get a handle on, he risks going from intriguing to boring in the end. Nathalie Portman is back as the love-interest, brought together 'by fate' according to Thor, though I'd say it was the script, working really hard to maneuver her into place. I like Portman in the role and it's always a joy watching her slap people in the face. Her assistant Darcy Lewis (Kat Dennings) works well as the comic relief, though the funniest moment involves a very quick and unexpected cameo from one of Thor's former comrades-in-arms. Idris Elba also returns, as gate-keeper Heimdall, a lot more well-known by now and still looking hot despite the colored lenses. I look forward to seeing him in the Mandela biopic.The main problem with Thor: The Dark World is one of tone. Sometimes it takes itself very seriously, sometimes not at all. That can work if the comedy is in the dialog and the interplay between characters. But as a viewer, you do want to feel that the writers are dedicated to telling a solid, well-thought out story and are not just having a laugh.@PopCultJunk</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the surprising successes to come out of Marvel's (now Disney's) ever-increasing catalogue of superhero CGI-fests, was 2011's Thor. Somehow Kenneth Branagh managed to avoid any possible silliness in the story of the super-powered, bleach-blonde Asgardian God battling against his greasy-haired brother and save Earth from destruction. Thor tended to stay away from the gold-plated, computer-generated tedium of Asgard and told a slightly comedic fish-out-of-water tale that was both charming and, even surprisingly, emotionally complex. The sequel, directed by HBO veteran Alan Taylor, spends less time on Earth and more time zapping around the other worlds that make up the universe's Nine Realms.In a backstory-heavy introduction, we learn that a powerful 'Dark Elf' Malekith (Christopher Eccleston) was the leader of a powerful race that tried to use an energy source called the Aether to plunge the Nine Realms into darkness, but was overthrown by Thor's (Chris Hemsworth) grandfather, Bor. With Malekith defeated, Bor hides the Aether in a stone column, establishing a new era of peace across the Realms. On present-day Earth, Thor's old flame Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) accidentally discovers the Aether, which is absorbed into her body. Malekith, who has being lying dormant for years, is re-awoken by this event and seeks the Aether for himself, but not before Thor manages to whisk Jane back to Asgard.It's a typically McGuffin-riddled story that Marvel have managed to turn into a multi-billion dollar franchise, that simply allows the superhero to get from point A to point B in order to face the new big baddie in town. The Dark World is a loud, convoluted and epilepsy-inducing mess of huge battles and CGI landscapes, but, even if you can't get your head around the ridiculous, head-spinning plot, it's sure entertaining. But what The Dark World lacks is the tongue-in-cheek charm of the first film, insisting on making the story and tone 'darker', and moves the action to the sickly world of Asgard.What it does boast, is the return of the superb chemistry between Hemsworth and Tom Hiddleston, the latter as the imprisoned Loki, forced to reflect after the near-apocalypse of The Avengers (2012). It has been reported that Loki's involvement was beefed up significantly post- production, and his sneering, malevolent, yet wounded presence is welcome, especially when Thor is forced to team up with his brother to tackle Malekith. This, however, came at the expense of Eccleston's pointy-eared menace, whose back-story and screen-time were reduced so harshly that you almost forget he's there. Portman's Jane Foster is still, unfortunately, a bland bore, mad at Thor for not calling in two years. He was saving the world, love.Ultimately, Thor: The Dark World is sporadically fun, punctured by moments of CGI tedium and head-spinning exposition (usually delivered by Anthony Hopkins' bored-looking Odin), that often evoke the unnecessary complexity of the rather painful Pirate of the Caribbean sequels. When the portals start appearing and the wrestling Thor and Malekith begin to throw each other between different worlds within the Nine Realms, I held my hands up and just gave up. And maybe this is the approach to take - just simply let it play out in front of your eyes, enjoy the charisma of Hemsworth - who delivers another delightful performance - and pray that someday Marvel will give Loki his own movie.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I'm not sure who really is to blame for this sequel's dragging pace and missed opportunities, but with an excellent third act, all is pretty much forgiven.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>And we're back with the first non-Iron-Man sequel in the Marvel universe with 'Thor: The Dark World', with the entire cast back ready for more saving the universe and defeating evil. However, this time around, the sequel felt uneasy and a little bit off, as it dragged in the mid-section quite a bit, or when Tom Hiddleston's Loki (Thor's adopted brother) is not on screen. Sure, the main event is Thor himself (Chris Hemsworth), but he seems to take a back seat for most of the film, as the co-stars really drive this movie as Thor smashes his hammer from foe to foe.This sequel is set to make a killing at the box office, and I'm sure it will opening weekend, but I imagine word of mouth after that will drive sales down. That's not to say that this is a poorly made movie, or even that it's not an enjoyable film. On the contrary, it's a very enjoyable film, it just dragged a bit, and I'm sure that's why Marvel filmed some extra scenes with Loki, which were sorely needed this time around. And director Alan Taylor does his best with the big steaming head of Marvel looking over his shoulder constantly. I'm not sure who really is to blame for this sequel's dragging pace and missed opportunities, but with an excellent third act, all is pretty much forgiven.As we see in the opening scene, which is a very early epilogue, is a battle with creatures known as the Dark Elves, who look very creepy on a planet called Alfheim, who were actually existing before the beginning of time. Their big weapon against everyone and everything is called Aether, which is a black and red gas like substance that can destroy all. However, the Dark Elves are seemingly all killed by Thor's grandfather, but a few manage to escape.Cut to present day, which is literally right after the 'Avengers' film as we see Loki in handcuffs awaiting his sentencing for destroying New York by King dad Odin (Anthony Hopkins). He is sentenced to the rest of his life in the Asgard dungeon with all of the other criminals from the other worlds or realms, which his cell resembles something similar in X-Men or any other futuristic movie, with white walls, and fancy furniture, and a glass like window instead of metal bars, where he has genuine conversations with his mother Frigga (Rene Russo) about their relationship and love, and who finally gets a bit more action and character this time around than the first film.Since the Bifrost bridge that connects Earth and Asgard was destroyed in the first film, Thor and his love interest Jane Foster (Natalie Portman), have not seen each other, as Thor and his small army of friends are keeping the peace on other realms. But Thor checks in from time to time with the gate keeper Heimdall (Idris Elba) who can see that she is doing alright, and even on a date with Richard (a under-used Chris O'Dowd). But when her intern Darcy (Kat Dennings) interrupts her date with news of some space anomaly that is similar to the first time Thor appeared, Jane is sucked into a different realm and the Aether enters her body, giving her some powers.As this happens, the remaining Dark Elves are awakened and led by Malekith (Christopher Eccleston) to retrieve the Aether and destroy the universe. With the cutting between the Dark Elves plotting war and the Asgardians and Earth, all becomes a bit jumbled and messy. As Thor takes Jane to Asgard to seek help and meet the family, it's clear that the Dark Elves mean business and the only one who can seem to help out is Loki, to which against better judgement is freed from prison and asked to help defeat the bad guys.It's only here with Loki, when the film sparks new life, that is until the final battle in Greenwich, London, where buildings are destroyed, and Earth, Asgard, and The Dark Elves square off. With the great character of Dr. Erik Selvig (Stellan Skarsgard) and Loki delivering great one-liners, the sequel finally finds its footing, and becomes the movie it needs to be.Director Allen Taylor has directed some of the best episodes of the best television shows of recent memory including 'The Sopranos', 'Mad Men', and 'Game of Thrones'. He seems to do a good job here without the advantage of having several hours worth of plot development, but again, Marvel is known for clashing heads with the creative types. And editors Dan Lebental and Wyatt Smith deserve some mention here, especially in the final 15 minutes of the film, as the battle travels between realms quite often, and the timing with this is flawless. And Brian Tyler's score is excellent, as it always adds some great suspense and emotion into every scene. I definitely need this soundtrack.And be sure, as always, to stay till the very end after credits roll. As there are not one, but TWO extra scenes that might make you scream and laugh.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Thor: The Dark World 3.5/10- I loved all of the Marvel movies, with the exception of Iron Man 2, and I thought the trailer made this movie look awesome. It was an understatement to say I had high hopes for this movie. It hurts me to say this, but I left a little disappointed.The beginning of the movie to me did not start off well. I thought the idea of the movie beginning with Thor restoring peace to the nine realms was good, however, I could not stop but from thinking that it all looked silly. The costume design looked like it was just mashed together at the last minute and I thought they could have picked a better setting to at least add some tone of seriousness to the opening scenes. I did like how all the Marvel movie including this one continue to offer good laughs through out the film. Unfortunately, there is a time and place for those laughs. Thor: the Dark Work did a relatively good of monitoring where to put those jokes until the final fight scene. The final fight should have had some intensity to it. I'm not gonna lie, I did laugh along with everyone else, but I was still expecting something more. This part that I was waiting for never came and because of this, the movie felt incomplete. The brightest light of the movie to me was Tom Hiddleston. His acting continues to grow and I thought he was even better in this movie than in the Avengers. He is the perfect choice to play Loki, the devious brother of Thor who is not sure which side he is on. Hiddleston dominated every scene he was in. Chris Hemworth delivered another solid performance as the hammer-wielding God Thor. He adds good humor to the character and does the best with the story line that he is given. Natalie Portman does an above-average job at playing the pretty yet extremely clever scientist Jane Foster. Anthony Hopkins seemed like he was not really giving his best effort as he was playing Odin, king of Asgard. Still, Anthony Hopkins worst is still better than most others best. The only time I thought the plot was well-written when the ending came which really got everyone in the theater thinking and that Tom Hiddleston's great performance finally resulted in something good. Now, just like any other Marvel movie, there is a scene after the credits. I was confused by what it meant, but I would be lying if it didn't leave me intrigued and excited for the next one. Was this movie the best in the Marvel series? No, not by far. Aside from its predecessors, the movie still offers enough good laughs and some solid action to make your experience entertaining. Still though, I was expecting a lot more than it gave.For more of my reviews, go to my website at reviewsbywest.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes, there are loopholes, like why don't the Asgardians fight with better technology than swords, since they have other fantastical technology, but other than that and one out-there moment when the portal throws a cell phone into the most unlikely of moments, this was so much fun. It even managed to keep too much silliness from happening in the romance department, which was a bonus.Great special effects, loved the new angel of old mythology meets technology, meets other worlds, meets star wars, meets flaky human existence.

		<shortDescription>A Weak Point in the Marvel Cinematic Universe</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When Thor's love interest gets cursed with a powerful object, Thor must protect her before an army and its ruthless leader try to get their hands on it to take over the remains of Earth.The strong points of this film are the continuing development of Loki as a villain (and perhaps a hero), Stellan Skarsgard, and Kat Dennings. The weak points are the over use of CGI, the use of Natalie Portman and the general way that Thor does not seem to fit in with the rest of the Marvel universe (even with the vague connection to "Guardians of the Galaxy").Not that this was a bad film, but it was probably the weakest in the series thus far, and there should be no surprise if we never see a "Thor III".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From the superb minds of Don Payne, Stan Lee and director Alan Taylor comes this next chapter in the life of the Mythical Norse God, Thor (Chris Hemsworth). We learn that Odin, (Anthony Hopkins) the King of the Viking Gods has discovered the Dark Elves have once again retrieved their Ancient power called the Aether and the Elves believed it's time to destroy Asgard with it. Thor believes his love interest Jane Forter (Natalie Portman) safeguards the power within her and it's up to him to want it destroyed before his new enemy Malekith (Christopher Eccleston) can use it to kill his father, destroy Asgard and Earth too. So with the unlikely help of his brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston) Thor confronts his enemies and engages in a gigantic battle. The movie is a lot easier to follow this time and all the best of CGI and the Special Effects teams do their utmost to entertain the audience with tremendous Action, adventure and magically moments. It a high flying movie and one which does it's level best to keep us glued to the ground while it goes whizzing around the world. It succeed in many way and I concur. It's fabulous in its story and marvelous in it's result. It trill us to the max and well worth, time and effort. As a result, it becomes a high flying, world destroying, titanic battle Classic of the first caliber. Recommended to all. ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A decent and entertaining sequel, "Thor: The Dark World" is a lot of fun, but can't quite measure up to its predecessors.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 2011, I was given a very decent surprise by the Marvel release "Thor", the fourth entry in "Phase One" of the "Marvel Cinematic Universe." (The overall franchise including characters like Iron Man, the Hulk, Captain America and Thor, all leading to the "Avengers" films) I wasn't sure what to expect going in, as the character seemed far too different from prior films in the franchise. "How could this work?", I would ask myself. But I'm glad I took the chance- I was blown away by the imagination, humor and wonderful storytelling. And it ended up being one of my favorite "Phase One" films.So I went into "Thor: The Dark World" with decently high expectations. The first film was such fun, I couldn't wait for the second. And how did it measure up? Unfortunately, it doesn't quite match the high quality of the character's previous outings in "The Avengers" and his 2011 titular film. However, despite that, it was still a very decent, humorous and very fun continuation of the character's story, and is well worth seeing for fans of the character and franchise.The story centers on Thor (duh), as he struggles with a number of situations, all leading to the possible destruction of the universe. After being re-united with his beloved Jane, Thor realizes her body has been inadvertently infused with "Aether", a powerful force that could potentially spell doom for all existence. Forced to protect her from a treacherous Dark Elf lord named Malekith, Thor will need to forge an uneasy alliance with his imprisoned brother Loki in order to save the known universe from Malekith's evil plans.As was the case in the first film, the cast is fantastic. Chris Hemsworth is blast as the hero Thor, this time showing more range and emotion than prior outings, making him more identifiable and compelling. Natalie Portman is also great as Jane, though I will comment that despite having a lot to do in the film, she doesn't have a lot of depth, making her feel tacked on at times, and as though she's only there to drive the plot forward. Kat Dennings and Stellan Skarsgard as Jane's companions Darcy and Selvig are an absolute joy, being more or less the comedic relief, as is newcomer Jonathan Howard as Darcy's new intern, Ian. Anthony Hopkins and Renee Ruso add a lot of class to the proceedings as Thor's parents, Odin and Frigga. Christopher Ecclestan is adequately threatening as Malekith, though he feels a bit under- developed. And supporting roles by the likes of Jamie Alexander, Ray Stephenson and Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje are all very well-played, making good work in their secondary roles. But as before, the real show- stealer is Tom Hiddleston as Loki. He is just such a breath of fresh air, and gives such a compelling performance that he almost always overshadows everyone else. A truly remarkable performer.The script by Christopher Yost, Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely (based on a story co-written by the late Don Payne) is where some of my issues lie. It's not a bad script by any means. It's tightly paced, has some great sequences, and generally had something for every character to do. It also has some surprisingly hard- hitting scenes of emotion that surprised me. But I just feel that it leaves some characters under-developed. And it felt like a far smaller story as a result. (Even though it's larger in scope, it feels like less is happening.)Directorial duties are handed off this time to Alan Taylor, best known as a television director, though he has a few feature films to his credit. And I think he did a serviceable job in this film, with a strong visual sensibility and a keen eye for visual storytelling. Though I do feel that his work as a television director does show in some sequences, particularly early on. While the film is mostly theatrical, a few action sequences do have a slight "tv- aesthetic", though I could forgive them as they were few and far between. That being said, I did prefer Kenneth Branagh's direction in the first film a bit more. His more operatic, even slightly melodramatic style just fit the tone better, in my opinion.The rest of the production is top-notch though. The costume and set design is shockingly beautiful as it was before. The different worlds are clearly defined, and it seems a lot of care, research and detail was put into every aspect, lending credibility to the overall story. The cinematography was also something to behold, and I particularly loved the lighting. And the visual effects are astounding. Some of the best CGI work I've seen lately. Even when I knew the things on-screen weren't real, I still "believed" they were there. The only thing I think fell a bit short was the musical score by Brian Tyler. It just wasn't memorable, and although it fit the mood, it felt generic. Whereas in the first movie, I found myself recalling the gorgeous musical cues and even humming them to myself... here, it's just sort of generic swords-and-sorcery fare. A lot of drums and horns. And a few appearances of what I liked to call the "Hans Zimmer 'Bwwwaaahhh'." That loud, deep noise that has been popular over the past 5 or so years, that just sort-of sounds like someone shouting "Bwwwaaahhh" with a deep voice whenever something big happens on-screen.However, although I feel like I was pointing out a lot of negatives, there's still many positives here too appreciate. The action is great, the cast wonderful and the humor a blast. It's still a darned fun, entertaining film, and worth seeing for fans... it just isn't quite as good as it could have been.I give "Thor: The Dark World" a pretty-good 7 out of 10. Worth seeing for fans, but it probably won't win any new viewers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I've got the aether, nothing can stop me now. Oh...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can't lie, I enjoyed watching the film. The great special effects, especially at first when the dark elf (yeah, that happened) space shuttles attacked Asgaard, the ridiculously cool Idris Elba, Loki's tricks, Thor's pathetic heroism and Stellan's craziness, the native brutality that Eccleston can radiate with so much ease (screw Doctor Who, I'll just destroy everything, LOL!), they all had something to do with it.But the story was not good, there so many holes in it that Swiss cheese would laugh at it. I don't want to spoil the movie, but in retrospect, Odin's plan was a lot better than what Thor did, not to mention the effect it had in the end. Jane's character is a helpless damsel in distress, although considering the other protagonists, it actually made sense. Thor's friends started cool, but then they ended up less than support characters. Thor himself does nothing but speak with a really deep voice and look pretty. Odin seems fickle and mean, I guess being king of the universe does that to anyone. Renee Russo is a queen, her character made the most sense to me.If one character stole the spotlight, it had to be Idris Elba's. He freaking destroyed an invisible space shuttle by jumping on it and stabbing it! Thor just swung his phallic symbol around. It was nice to see science triumph (after all, it always does) but the mambo jumbo spear like thingies that detect and also cause stuff were really too much.Chris O'Dowd is in this film, too. He is right in his element, as Malekith wanted to restart the universe to fix things, as it were, but has a really small role. Benicio del Toro appears as the mysterious collector at the end (wait until after the first credits to see him). He looks really cool. And if we are to praise the support characters, Zachary Levi looked interesting as the calm gentlemanish swordsman with great skill. Perhaps an offshoot of Thor, featuring Thor's friends rather than himself, would be a good idea, no?Also, after all the credits there is a funny scene with the Gwoemul- like monster that people forgot on Earth. Yeah, kudos if you were wondering what happened to it in the end :)Bottom line: you can make a thousand How It Should Have Ended parodies after this film, but that doesn't mean I didn't enjoy it. It hurts to think of the exquisite beauty the graphics people created for a movie that had the story of a fairy tale book for three year olds and how much more coolness a great story would have gotten out of the film. Too bad three year olds seem to be a target demographic for the American film industry. After all, I would rather eat bread than starve, but a steak now and then doesn't hurt, does it?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Actually this movie left no real lasting impact on me</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Marvel Cinematic Universe is probably one of the most profitable franchises of all time. I honestly think that there are a few good movies such as The Incredible Hulk, Iron Man, Thor, Captain America and The Avengers. Unfortunately I didn't like Iron Man 2, Iron Man 3 and Agents Of SHIELD. I was a little skeptical to see this but I ended up enjoying it for just a dumb movie.The plot is that The Dark World has been around since before the Dawn of Man and they are awakened again when Jane Foster finds their greatest weapon and merges with it. Thor then returns to her and they fly to Asgard. Malekith - the leader of The Dark World then has the ability to track the weapon and unleashes an attack on Asgard to gain the weapon and you've guessed it, destroy the world. After Thor's mother gets killed and Asgard could not handle the attack Thor gets a plan underway to defeat Malekith.The best thing about this movie by far is the look of it. I liked Asgard, the worlds we see all except for The Dark World itself which - don't get me wrong does look good but it's just so unimaginative, it just leaves no impact.The drama of the movie is actually handled pretty well. I mean at least unlike Iron Man 3 this movie has the guts to kill someone off. They actually give the character a decent send-off too. They also handle the scenes of grief quite okay. I say okay because the editing cuts back and forth to more attempts at humour. That just doesn't work.The acting also is okay. From Chris Hemsworth, Anthony Hopkins and Tom Hiddleston are all pretty good in their parts. If there were any people that fell flat mostly that would be due to the material that they had to work with.I just have to talk about the comedy. The humour... falls flat. I really don't have a better word to describe how I saw the humour. Seeing Stellan Skarsgard wearing no pants isn't funny in my opinion and the humour is full of stuff like that.If there are 2 more underwhelming things it would have to be the hero and the villain. Thor doesn't go through a single character arc and just remains the same person he was at the end of Thor and The Avengers. And for a character that wants to destroy the world I'm pretty underwhelmed with Malekith. I don't really remember Malekith for anything other than "That guy who kills Thor's mother and tries to destroy the world".Ever watch a movie that looks great and keeps you entertained for the run time but afterwards there isn't anything to remember it for? That's what this one is like. It isn't great but at the same time it isn't terrible. It is worth a watch and it is a million times better than any of the other things MCU has released this year.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Thor: The Dark World (2013)** (out of 4) Thor (Chris Hemsworth) must team up once again with Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) as the two must battle something that could destroy Asgard. I'm really not going to waste any time going over a "plot" because there really isn't much of one. I'm sure die-hard fans of Marvel are going to love this film but to me it was just very pretty looking but rather hollow. I was surprised at how effective the first film was and looking back on it, it's clear that director Kenneth Branagh had a lot to do with that. The first film had a very strong story, great characters, good performances and an energy that not many action films have. This one here is pretty much missing all of that stuff and instead we're just given routine action scenes that are quite loud coming from the speakers but they contain very little else. You know you're in trouble whenever an action picture has non-stop action and yet you continue to yawn. The entire movie just seemed so flat from an energy standpoint and to me it was clear that director Alan Taylor just wasn't able to pump up any emotion. The action scenes are incredibly flat and even the better than average CGI effects couldn't make up for it. Even worse is that the characters are all rather one-note with no real surprises to be found. There's no question that Hemsworth is perfect for Thor and he manages to turn in another good performance. Portman seems rather bored or just doing the film due to a contract forcing her. Even Anthony Hopkins and Rene Russo appear bored this time out. Tom Hiddleston does a very good job in the role of Loki and he's without question the best thing in the picture. Kat Dennings offers up the only amount of energy in the film. Thankfully, unlike many other Marvel movies, this one here keeps its running time rather short and for that I'm very thankful.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Super hero movies can be great when done right (The Dark Knight), but they are such money makers that studios just put out the same unoriginal movies &amp; sit back as the masses give them millions, not caring about quality.Thor: The Dark World is an example.The story line is very boring and develops awkwardly. Once more, the viewers are left in the dark (pun intended) when trying to understand Thor's dimensions, parallel universes, worlds, and how to travel between them. There are plenty of action scenes,and -- differently than other super hero movies -- there's comic relief during the fights so we are not actually bored for 15 minutes as the hero and villain ultimately destroy a city (cough cough Man of Steel); which is good.The acting is fine, but not superb. I will point out to Kat Dennings as a bright spot, and Loki is always an enjoyable character.Other than that, the directing is not original, the plot repetitive, and the actors not that exciting.But, if in comparison to other super hero movies of nowadays, this one fares above the average. Good watch if what you want is some action to live up your rainy, Sunday afternoon on the couch.SCREENPLAY: 3/10 DIRECTING: 5/10 ACTING: 6/10 CINEMATOGRAPHY: 7/10 SOUNDTRACK: 5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>&#xfffc;This film is not recommended.Thor is back but, this time around, it felt like a visit to the Bizarro World rather than a journey to the dark world as the title proclaims. Everything that I truly enjoyed in the first installment of this franchise had an oddly opposite reaction for me in Thor: The Dark World. Everything in this latest installment seemed out of kilter from its entertaining 2011 predecessor. (However, it was during the film that I did have a full out-of-body experience: I so wanted to take this body out of the theater, away from the stifling boredom and unending disengagement of all the silly action and sci-fi mythos, but dear moviegoers, I dutifully fought that urge.)In Thor: The Dark World, the comic banter is missing (with only one laugh total), as is the beefcake factor (with only one shirtless interlude). With this sequel, everything seems terribly oppressive. In his battle to save Earth, Thor must battle a new villain, Malekith (played one- dimensionally by Christopher Eccleston). Malekith is the leader of the Dark Elves, a group of mutant warriors bent on world destruction (what else?) with the help of a weapon of mass destruction called the Aether (pronounced ether). As with the first film, the film bounces from one battle scene on either a desolate planet or an Art Deco wonderland. Whenever the action takes place on Planet Asgard, the film has recharged energy and strong action footage, whereas, when we go to Planet Earth, the film bogs down and lands with a thud.Chris Hemsworth, who was so much fun when we first met him as Thor, plays the role all too seriously. He's still an earnest hero, but that fish out of water conceit is no more. (And it was that premise which helped achieve the film's unique and special charm in the first outing.) Natalie Portman is wasted in her role as his astrophysicist gal pal. The wonderful chemistry between these actors playing Thor and Jane that once was is no more. Now Jane is a cute harpy and Thor goes from hunk to lunk. At least, he still has that magic hammer and knock- out abs. Hopkins, who was solid before as Odin, is now all ham and he never quite passes the muster. Such fine actors as Ray Stephenson, Idris Elba, Rene Russo, Kat Dennings, and Stellan Skarsgard are underused in minor roles. Only Tom Hiddleston as Thor's jealous and evil sibling, Loki, has the campy menace and star presence to make this film sequel-worthy.The CGI is more than adequate as is Alan Taylor's direction. A few action sequences are well staged while others are inessential time fillers. Like the mighty Aether, the numerous and loud sci-fi action numbs the senses and only dulls the pain. The screenplay by Christopher L. Yost, Christopher Markus, and Stephen McFeely is more convoluted than necessary with too much exposition spent on the Norse sci-fi background or establishing the next fight scene instead of developing characters and motives. Thor: The Dark World just seems needlessly strung together from one battle sequence to the next, as Thor, Jane, and the gang travel from one portal dimension to the next anomaly. The film plays more like an expensive video game than it does a real movie. Boring.As superhero movies go, the film is a minor disappointment. Marvel's Thor: The Dark World is no marvel at all. It's just more of the same, and not really all that interesting. GRADE: CANY COMMENTS: Please contact me at: jadepietro@rcn.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The better Superhero film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Disney might think this film made more money than Thor 1 because of it's synergy with the other Marvel superhero films and while that might be true to a certain extent I think it's probably because Thor 2 is simply a much better film than Thor 1. What it does have in common with the Avengers e.g. is an excellent balance of humor, action, effects and drama. We have arrived at a point where VFX can't hardly improve anymore but in The Dark World they pulled out all the stops: we get gorgeous vistas, battles and large scale destruction effects and not a single shot looks fake. Chris Hemsworth also seems to be getting more familiar with his character as his performance has certainly improved. I was getting pretty sick of superhero movies but I'm glad to say this one has restored my faith (partially). For me The Dark World is certainly better than any of the Iron Man films.

		<shortDescription>Another fun entry for the Marvel franchise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Two years after the events of 'The Avengers', Loki has been imprisoned in Asgard and Thor is restoring peace through the realms. As the realms are about to converge and an older-than-the-universe evil awakens again, it's up to Thor to protect his girlfriend Jane, who has the key power needed for the villain to triumph.Part of the 'Phase Two' of Marvel's cinematic universe, 'Thor: The Dark World' is the second solo adventure of superhero and Norse deity played by Chris Hemsworth. It stands strong mostly thanks to a cast that is already more used to their roles.Hemsworth, by now, has already mastered his role. He managed to find the right balance for his character, far more mature and leader-like than in his previous appearances. As before, Tom Hiddleston dominates every time he is on screen as Loki, being responsible for some of the film's best moments. Anthony Hopkins is good, but flawed; his Odin acts a bit too out of character later on, considering how he was established in the first film it is hard to believe he would get so carried away by grief and risk the entire universe for a relatively petty revenge.Earth-wise, once again the film suffers from the same problems. Natalie Portman is quite weak here (as much as in the first), which is problematic considering she has a larger role; meanwhile, Kat Dennings and Stellan Skarsgard once again serve as nothing but a sad attempt at comic relief. Skarsgard, in particular; his character, so serious and intelligent on 'The Avengers', has been reduced to a pathetic loon that has little to do with how his character had been presented before.The plot is inventive, and the expanding on the Marvel universe was nice. The whole Dark Elves storyline was good, the villains were menacing and challenging (Christopher Eccleston and Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje were very good) and the concept of the Aether, while somewhat underdeveloped, was nice. Sif and the Warriors Three, as well as Heimdall, were fun to watch if a bit underused.The special effects and action scenes were nice as always, and even without Kenneth Branagh Asgard kept the same fantastic-yet-medieval look from the first film. The final battle, with the characters moving through dimensions, was a particularly good visual feast.My main problem with the film, though, is not the weak comedic try or the underuse of certain aspects. Main problem is the fact this is an established universe where Thor is not the only hero. In 'The Avengers', it took multiple heroes (Thor amongst them) and a super-secret spy agency to stop an otherwordly invasion. In here, you have an otherwordly being, even more powerful than the one before, who is not wanting to rule the world but to DESTROY IT and ALL OF EXISTENCE... Yet Thor tackles him by himself, and ENDS UP VICTORIOUS?!Considering a 'nobody' astrophysicist like Jane (Portman) could track the dimensional rifting, wouldn't SHIELD do the same and investigate a possible threat? Where is Iron Man, who has been shown to go around the world relatively fast? It is not like no one knows what is happening, as there is a lot of people watching and filming the battle.When you consider it by itself, 'Thor: The Dark World' is a very good and fun superhero film, only dragged down by its weak attempts at humor (8/10). Franchise-wise, however, the film ends up with some plot- holes and continuity illogicality (6/10).The ending was very good, foreshadowed but not overly predictable. The mid-credits scene expands the Marvel universe further, and creates hype for their future works.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thor returns and hammers in great entertainment...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Normally not one to be keen on superhero movies, but still I do watch the movies for entertainment. And whereas the previous Thor movie was alright, then "Thor: The Dark World" does surpass the previous movie.Sure, the storyline is cliché and you see what's coming a mile away. But still, it works out, because this is generic to the core, but there is just something fundamentally entertaining about this classic good vs. evil storyline, where evil wants to lay waste to the universe, and a single force of heroic good-doers thwart the evil plans.The storyline in "Thor: The Dark World" is about an ancient race of dark elves, who according to Asgardian legend, are conquered and exist no more. Along with them is the Aether, a force so strong that it can lay waste to the universe. When Jane Foster (played by Natalie Portman) comes across a minor cosmic anomaly in her search for Thor, little does she know that she has stumbled upon the Aether and awoken it from its dormant stasis, and along with it the dark elves.As for the effects, then "Thor: The Dark World" does deliver right on the money. The CGI are awesome to behold and also very realistic, which just adds to the worth of the entire movie. Without proper effects, then a Marvel superhero movie would not work out on the same level.And as for the costumes, armors and creature designs. Well that just blew me away. There were so many awesome details and concept designs going on here that it was just mind boggling. Asgard is indeed a marvelous sight to behold, as are the armors of the Asgardian warriors. But the Kursed creatures that were with the dark elves, that was just beyond anything I have seen.It is nice to see people return to their previous roles, and even with a pinch of comedy as in where Loki portrays and makes fun of Captain America.If you enjoy these particular types of movies, then "Thor: The Dark World" is well worth watching. Great action and lots of adrenaline to keep you on your toes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The second movie of "Thor" was portrays more about the world of Asgard, where magic and technical as one.Costumes in "Thor : The Dark World " is another great thing in the movie. The metallic armor lined up in rows when military training,classic clothes of Thor and Loki,or the dress of the queen of Eir and Jane is very beautiful.In terms of techniques, Marvel Studio's performance proved they were still very stable on the monumental level of context, the destruction of structures.However, the monumental of the effects can not compensate for the lack of depth of the script.The script is so simple that almost minimalist, do not knots, do not climax and do not impression.The story of "Thor 2" sink into oblivion because of not accents, not including the spread beginning, longer than necessary so that everyone who impatient will feel a little sleepy.But overall, "Thor : The Dark World " is still a good entertaining movie for the fans of the Marvel movies. So, go ahead with fresh popcorn bags and go see "Thor 2" for the weekend!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Thor : The Dark World is a must see movie. It gave me hope in Marvel Studios after the disappointment I have seen in The Wolverine and Iron Man 3. Amazing movie , excellent story , great action and good slight of Comedy. The cast was amazing. Chris Hemsworth is THOR , no one could have done it better and he is actually much better than in Part One. Tom Hiddleston ( Loki ) was simply amazing and without him the movie wouldn't make it. He makes the villain someone you want to be which is rare. Heimdall ( Idris Elba ) was more involved than he was in part one which I liked it. If you haven't seen it yet then wait till the end or till they sent you out of the cinema cause there is too more scenes , one of them is worth seeing.Again LOKI was amazing with him expect the unexpected :) , you gonna love him.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing CGI</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One thing for sure about this movie is the CGI. It is quite impressive and amazing. A lot of effort has been put to make this movie a good science fiction movie. However, as in most of the science fiction movie or the stories from Marvel. there is always the nagging thing which bothers me. In the set up where the character is using laser gun or whatever they call it, there is still some army who is fighting with a sword, lance and using shield. This does not really making any sense. If they could create something weapon of laser class, why would they fight using a sword ? And to make it worse, the party with the sword is actually beating the guy with the gun. I know this is science-fiction and movie is an imagination of something, but can it be made with more sense ? Another detail which I find a bit annoying is the "politically correct" selection of characters. This is a story of Nordic god. I have nothing against the African American people, but does it make sense to see one of the God portrayed by a black guy ? It does not matter how good the acting of this particular person, but he is so out of place in the environment of Nordic setting. Maybe for once; drop the "politically correct" attitude and do something for the benefit of the art...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as good as the first film, but fun nonetheless</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Phase 1 of the Marvel Project is all done and dusted, a phase which started on a massive high with the first Iron Man (arguably the best solo Marvel superhero film to date), and ended on one with Avengers Assemble (the best Marvel film, in my opinion). Marvel Films did what was seemingly impossible, and did it unbelievably well. So, like millions of others, I waited with bated bread for Phase 2 to kick off. Iron Man 3 rolled around and?heh. It wasn't an awful film and the Tony Stark character took an interesting turn, but it didn't live up to the success of his first two outings and the Marvel standard as a whole.Which brings us on to the next step of Phase 2 ? Thor. The first film was one of the big surprises of the genre. While his other superhero friends are steeped in some level of reality, Thor (Chris Hemsworth) is from an entirely different world, so the task of bringing him into 'our' world and making it believable was a tough one. But they did it, and the result was a thoroughly entertaining film that took advantage of the character's supernatural elements. With the sequel, directors Alan Taylor and James Gunn (taking over from Kenneth Branagh) decided to amp the supernatural side up even more.While the first movie introduces us to Asgard, Thor's home planet, The Dark World is set almost entirely in the alien world. This time, Asgard is under threat from an even darker foe hell-bent on literally destroying the entire universe. The epic plot allows the film to explore Asgard with much more detail, and we gain a better understanding of how the world works. Expectedly, we're treated to some gorgeous CGI and special effects, making it fun to watch. The fish-out-of-water formula is also subverted as Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) is now in Asgard, essentially playing our eyes and ears. Unfortunately, that formula isn't as successful as it was in the first movie. Watching Thor try to make sense of Earth is genuinely hilarious, but we don't quite get that with Foster. Funnier than that is seeing Foster's Earth friends go about their business (Kat Dennings, in particular, is very funny).In fact, the scenes in Asgard, as a whole, aren't overly amusing. That is, until, one Tom Hiddleston enters the fray.As Loki, Hiddleston is once again sublime. That scathing sarcasm, the wry smiles, his excellent diction and tone; everything about the performance is a pleasure to experience. It is by no means an exaggeration to suggest that he steals every scene he is in. My favourite scenes were the ones that he was in ? just waiting for him to say something, and knowing it was going to be gold. And it pretty much always was. The character's journey in the film is also very gripping, and sets us up nicely for whatever might come next. Loki is to Thor what Iago is to Othello: he is the actual main character, he is the one we want to see. And just like people have argued that Shakespeare's play should be called Iago, I would strongly argue that the film should have been named after Loki.Where we have a problem is that, when Loki isn't on screen (and his screen time is crucial but limited), the film just never seems as engaging. I found myself missing the character, and wishing he was ever-present. I won't reveal any spoilers but will say the ending makes up for that longing, but that doesn't stop the film suffering because of it.This is, overall, why the sequel just doesn't work as well as the first film. And it isn't just the lack of Loki's presence; other characters I wanted to see more of were used sparingly. Kat Dennings, as mentioned before, was one of those characters; and Stellan Skarsgard was another. Instead, we saw a lot more of Anthony Hopkins (boring and uninspiring), Idris Elba (strong presence but also boring) and Christopher Ecclestone (who is completely unrecognisable but actually quite good).Don't get me wrong, The Dark World is not a bad film. It's much better than Iron Man 3, and there is enough excitement and good action to stop you getting bored. It just isn't as engaging as the first one, that's all. Sadly, Phase 2 of the Avengers Project has started with a bit of a whimper; we can only hope it gets better from here.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thor: The Dark World</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Personally, I feel that all of these superhero movies are getting played out. I was excited and along for the ride just like everyone else when this whole superhero craze started. Now after the Iron Man Trilogy, Captain America, Thor, and The Avengers films have come out out, we can see which hero can truly hold their own movies and which ones should just stay with the group. After the events of Thor and The Avengers, Thor: The Dark World picks up two years after Thor (Chris Hemsworth) left Jane (Natalie Portman) in the first film. Loki (Tom Hiddelston) stands trial for his actions on Earth and is imprisoned. The Dark Elf, Malekith, is resurrected when Jane's body is possessed by the Aether. Thor soon comes back for Jane, bringing her back to Asgard, where Malekith and the Dark Elves wage war to receive the Aether. Chris Hemsworth is and interesting actor, Thor is not the superhero to have his own movie. I'm not a fan of 3D, and I'm especially not a fan of 3D when there are multi-colored buildings and rainbow roads popping out at me, it's brain-numbing. Tom Hiddleston is sensational, I love his character work with Loki, its extremely fascinating and impressive. Natalie Portman, once again is missed place here. She is one of my favorite actresses, but everything falls flat with with her character. I just don't care. Anthony Hopkins does his usual "Hopkins" soft, mono-tone whisper, then yells at the top of his lungs. The film definitely has its flaws, but it has a few perks also, a few great fighting sequences and Loki's masterful illusions. I wasn't the biggest fan of the first film, I definitely enjoyed it and have watched it a few times since, I think Thor: The Dark World might be slightly better, but not by much. Alan Taylor, the films director, does a fine job with some of Thor and Loki's fighting sequences but for the most part when its dialogue driven, most scenes fall flat, and the CGI is overwhelming. I give Thor: The Dark World a 7 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I loved it, but somewhat disappointed.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I overall enjoyed the movie.I loved when they showed Loki broken down due to the death that went along with it. The scene with the funeral was beautifully done, as well. I also was really caught off guard when they cut off Thor's hand, it was such a good surprise, even though it was a bad thing. There was still a good flow to the movie.But, there were a few things I didn't care for too much in the movie. For Example, the beginning of the movie and middle of the movie was a bit slow. The action of the movie didn't really start till then end. It took a while to pick up, which wasn't what I was expecting. There also were some scenes that I felt weren't necessary that were in the movie. The last thing I was disappointed with was my favorite line in the trailers was not in the movie.I still loved the movie and would recommend it to anyone who is curious about Thor.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>suffers from superhero saturation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was hoping that the second installment of Thor might be memorable, well it wasn't. This movie(and all of the rest of the Marvel trailers I saw) suffers from superhero saturation. Let's just face it how many times can an alien being destroy a city, put the hero and his friends in jeopardy before you just get tired. This is the problem with Thor, you just get tired while watching it. Thor just isn't drawn in this installment interesting enough. He was a great fish out of water in the first movie, a egoist brought down by kindness and guilt. In this movie he's just sad and mopey. It doesn't help that his lady love is silly and not very supportive. Jane Foster is window dressing instead of partner. Yes Loki steals the scenes, but in the end it's all for nothing but another chance to do it all again.</fullReview>

But Thor 2 wasn't that great. Loki was the only character that was actually interesting and hilarious. There was some good action sequences but I wont ruin anything.

I'm not talking about Chris Hemsworth, Tom Hiddelson or God forbid Anthony Hopkins those guys are well casted and did their jobs well. The story of Thor is based of the scandinavic myths and songs and in the movie Thor more or less acts as a viking and looks like one too everything in Asgard is made to mimic the Scandinavian culture or perception of Asgard after all thats where the sourse is from and it is such a bummer when you see that Heimdall is cast as black nothing against Idris Elba great actor but thats not how Scandinavians describe it in their songs thats not how it is even in the comic book sourse and what about Thour's gang one of them fights with rapier the other one is Asian thanks god he does not fight with nunchaku although that would make more sense. But the real deal comes with the elves shooting bazukas and guns and some of them are black again.When last you saw an afro-American elf.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still rocking' the God of Thunder thing....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A fun fun movie from the first frame to the last (and by "last I also mean the after the after credits scene...so don't walk out until the credits are all done). Even tho the story is your typical superhero fair, (bad guy wants to destroy the universe, good guy fights to stop him) it isn't typically told. There is a abundance of superhero action to be had, but also some really tight emotional moments as well,as characters grow, die, morn, go a bit nuts, and laugh together (and we with them). Christopher Eccleston and Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje are virtually unrecognizable under their make up as the chief villain, Malekith and his henchman Kurse, but that doesn't stop them from oozing malice every time they are on screen. Chris Helmsworth is still rocking' the God of Thunder thing exceptionally well as does the rest of the returning cast in their respective roles (with some stellar work from Hopkins as Odin)....all except Natalie Portman. She is the one and only drawback to TtDW. Without going in to too much detail here, she was contractually forced to return for the sequel, and it shows in her phoned in performance. But the shining moment of the whole film for me was, of course Hiddles, who returns to his third go 'round as Loki with great scene-chewing aplomb. Every time Hiddles' Loki hits the screen we can see something working behind his eyes. Plot, scheme, love, or hate..we're really not sure....but you can't take your eyes off him.Loki's not the villain here..nor is he the hero...he is a live wire, or loose cannon, if you will, we never know what he'll do or say next, all we know is he's having more fun than a Norse god should be allowed to.But underneath all the bravado and anger Loki exudes, thanks to Hiddles layered performance, we are treated to moments when Loki's conflicted (after the death of someone he supposedly hates) and that he also has a protective side (puts his body between destruction and a mortal) for those he "likes". Loki will never be a hero like his "big brother", but TtDW shows he has the potential, if not the desire.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have just returned from watching Thor: The Dark World and I have nothing but praise for it! For some reason i was expecting to be underwhelmed by this outing but am extremely and pleasantly surprised by the quality of this film....the acting, particularly from Hemsworth &amp; Hiddlestone is genuinely first rate, and the direction skillfully engages you and even more skillfully avoids falling in tired cliché which is extremely impressive as the Dark Elf plot line is, to be honest, nothing new.As a reader of the Thor comics it is fantastic to see the characters of the main protagonists being fleshed out in line with their comic book portrayals. The Loki that Hiddlestone has slowly shaped over three films is now, for my mind, the Loki of the comic books. It's this kind of thing that really pleases me. Hemsworth's Thor is now much more rounded and fleshed out (pun intended, my girlfriend was extremely impressed with one particular scene). The effects for Mjolnir and indeed for all of Thor's powers were much more considered and impressive than in previous films . Nice to see.As others have said, the main pulling point in film is the relationship between Thor and Loki and it's this that gives the film a really satisfying depth and interest. This is a highly enjoyable and impressive film and I will be seeing this again, (in 2D though as 3D adds nothing) and whole heartedly recommend this to others. 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Thor: the dark world, is a film that, when I walked into the cinema, I had very high expectations of because the first one was very good, I was not disappointed and the viewer won't be either. The film has a very good beginning as within only ten minutes of the film starting the character of Thor, played by Chris Hemsworth, is introduced to the audience just after (spoiler) a circular storm occurs, pouring over Jane Foster (Natalie Portman), Ian Boothby (Jonathon Howard) and Darcy Lewis (Kat Dennings), this is then followed by some mild violence and the action gets better from then onwards. It is extremely gripping and fast paced throughout the whole film, there is never a quite moment. (spoiler) There is even a small appearance from the much loved Marvel character, Captain America, only small but it is a cool moment that reminds you that this isn't just any old film, this is a Marvel film. I really enjoyed this film and I would definitely recommend it to anyone. The ending of this film makes you very excited for the next instalment of the Thor films.</fullReview>

The cast are all perfect all playing straight but also loose. I was worried when the title included the word Dark, used also for Star Trek into Darkness, but thankfully it relates literally to the Dark planet and the baddie who wants to turn the Universe from light to Dark. the humour was even better than in Avengers, and the cross referencing with the Marvel universe and characters was perfect, looking forward to seeing it again this time in 2d if i can find a cinemas that will be playing it on a large screen if not will wait for the DVD</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thor: Definitely worth seeing, but not as entertaining as the latest hit movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Thor 2 was a thrilling sequel to Marvel's Thor movie series, and the movie branches from Thor and The Avengers. Loki, depicted by Tom Hiddleston, plays an important role in saving the world, which is unexpected because he played someone who tried to destroy the Earth in Thor and The Avengers. Jane Foster, portrayed by Natalie Portman, played a more useful person and proved her brilliance while working with Thor, played by Chris Hemsworth. The top box office movie taught me some Norse mythology, useful for English class, proving the film not only fun but educational. I learned that there were brother and rival gods named Thor and Loki who had a father named Odin. They all lived in Asgard. Tom Hiddleston fans rejoice!This movie, however, ranks between unnatural and natural. On previous reviews I've defined what I call natural, which is when a superhero movie makes the audience feel as if they are part of its world, among the bystanders. While this film was wildly entertaining, it does not line up well among the other superhero movie greats, such as Spider-Man with Tobey Maguire and the new Marvel and DC Comics movies. Lately, these movies have been getting more and more action-packed and adventurous, causing my previous ratings, such as this one, to go down. While Chris Hemsworth definitely fits the role physically, the acting was not exactly on par; at least, it still caused me to cringe a bit.This movie ranks a 5, only because movies such as the Revenant are ranked 10 and other comic book movies have been much more interesting and captivating than this one.</fullReview>

Thor: The Dark World has a good story, good action, and the movie is just plain entertaining! This movie is just so much fun! The best performances are Chris Hemsworth as Thor and Tom Hiddleston as Loki. Both actors are fantastic, and I think Loki is by far the best villain in the MCU, and I think Thor is one of the top 3 Avengers characters! Now, the villain Malekith, isn't too bad! He isn't the most complex villain, but the actor does a good job even though most of his dialogue is complete gibberish. I really like Stellan Skarsgard as Erik Selvig, and Anthony Hopkins as Odin. Erik is a fantastically fun supporting character, and Odin is awesome! I'm really sad that Loki probably murdered Odin.My biggest problems with the film are: Natalie Portman as Jane Foster, Kat Dennings as Darcy, and Jonathan Howard as the intern. They are just plain bad supporting characters, and one of the reasons that I just cannot give these Thor movies a perfect 10/10! Now, Natalie Portman isn't a bad actress in this movie, but her character is SO TERRIBLE, that she just comes across bad in the movie. But I seriously CANNOT STAND Kat Dennings as Darcy! She was alright in the first Thor movie, but in this one she was so bad! I'm so happy that Jane and Darcy will not be in Thor: Ragnorak. The Intern isn't that bad, but he serves no purpose to the film! My only other problem with the Thor films is that I want to see more of Asgard, but I don't think that can be considered a problem, I guess that just tells you that I like Asgard so much that I want to see more! Overall, Thor: The Dark World is fun, funny, and entertaining. I love this movie, and you'll enjoy it too. I'd give it a 9/10!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Movie I like It</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The acting was solid and good. The production value was super. Everything else was really wonderful. It's totally different from the first part of Thor. I like this movie and want to watch again. There are very some good things this movie. The guy Loki is one of the only one redeeming qualities of this movie and he is very convincing. The Stan Lee Cameo is also great and funny like always. There is a awesome twist I wont spoil. But that's about it.The only reason for I am writing this review is, because as i have seen the the other reviews here are either someone hated it totally or thought. I would like to say about this movie, It was the best movie they ever saw. The truth is somewhere in the middle, Thor will never be the best movie you ever saw. If you think its the worst ever then you have not seen Dragonball evolution.I am totally enjoyed this movie. I loved when they showed Loki broken down due to the death that went along with it. The scene with the funeral was beautifully done, as well. I also was really caught off guard when they cut off Thor's hand, it was such a good surprise, even though it was a bad thing. There was still a good flow to the movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It wasn't that long ago that I remember the deep feeling of appreciation for Marvel as they delivered on their promise. After all, "The Avengers" was the Hollywood rarity- a film that audiences were asked to be patient for, and for all intents and purposes, the hype was well-justified. Going forward, we know "The Avengers: Age of Ultron" is coming in 2015, and "The Avengers 3&#x2033; in 2018. These immense upcoming films will follow the same pattern as the first, in that a series of individual films will set up the events to culminate in the team-up. I'm fine with that, but I do require Marvel to maintain their focus with these solo efforts. "Thor: The Dark World" is a very good looking movie that doesn't pay off in the most disappointing way- it doesn't respect its own audience, and thus becomes a huge missed opportunity for Marvel.If you've seen "Thor" and "The Avengers", you know that the 'Bifrost' and 'rainbow bridge' were destroyed, Loki (Hiddleston) is going back to Asgard and prison, and that Thor (Hemsworth) returned to Earth, but without visiting Jane Foster (Portman). These issues will need to be addressed in this film, and they are (mostly). After "Thor" made a big deal about the destruction of the Bifrost and its implications, nothing is said about how it was repaired in such short time (2 years). I suppose that is of little consequence in the big scheme of events. Loki still plots away in his Asgardian prison cell, apparently not humbled by his convincing defeat. He still feels entitled to a throne (any throne will do). The astrophysicist Jane Foster, as Heimdall (Elba) tells us in the first film, still searches for a way to reach Thor through the path of science. For as little time as they had together in the first film, clearly the Prince of Asgard and the Earth-bound, mortal scientist formed a strong connection- something this film doesn't spend enough time extrapolating. These characters will do anything for each other, but I've struggled to buy into their bond; after all, they haven't been on a single date, haven't shared their feelings or intentions to each other, and haven't shared a bed (that we're aware of). Other than a few longing glances, what is it about these two characters that make their actions believable or justified?Dr. Foster is working out of London in this film- luckily for her, that happens to be the EXACT location (Tanzania was apparently too remote) of a magnificent quantum space event is taking place. The 'Nine Realms' of the universe are all aligning at once, and this 'convergence' apparently allows for easy travel amongst the many branches of existence. As the movie tells us, an artifact of a sinister nature (of course) was hidden a long time ago during the last convergence, and wouldn't you know it- our favorite senator from Naboo (oops, wrong film) stumbles upon it. Literally.This artifact, designed by Malekith (Eccleston) of the ancient race of beings known as Dark Elves, looks exactly like angry Dimetapp to me. According to the movie, it's darkness as a weapon. So, Dr. Foster gets 'infected' by this substance, and becomes slightly dangerous to others. Except Thor. On top of that, the dormant Dark Elves are reawakened across the universe by Jane's interaction with the gooey Robitussin. I'm still confused by these things, but this film isn't interested in explaining away that kind of logic.Doesn't it seem like a grave misstep by the all-powerful Odin and the mighty Thor to have this weapon in the heart of their kingdom? Granted, Thor does have a plan to save her, but by then the Dark Elves have come a calling on Asgard, with technology that is at least 9,000 years old but makes the modern Asgardian defense seem obsolete. That perfectly encapsulates the problems with this movie; we've established a feasible, grounded-in-reality 'Thor-verse' to work with, and this film just craps all over those very rules. I also wondered where the entire population of Asgard was the first film gave us a bustling, populated kingdom, but when Dark Elves attacked, I only remember seeing soldiers and royalty. Did I miss something, or did the filmmakers get lazy?I should counter by saying that this isn't a bad film- it is earnest, and funny at times. It simply seems to have forgotten its audience as well as what made the other films in the 'Avengers' pantheon work, which is what bothers me. After sitting through five set-up films before "The Avengers", producer and Marvel film chief Kevin Feige should know better than to allow a film like this to go through- one that treats the established audience like amateurs. It's a rushed, heavily edited (it appears), logic-defying action spectacle that lacks the emotional resonance of the first film and defies the established logic we were used to. Is it possible that there is a better edition of this film out there, or that director Alan Taylor (of 'Game of Thrones' fame) had a grittier, longer version in mind? With the film clocking in at 111 minutes, and with rumors about studio-directed reshoots earlier this past year, I can't help but wonder if those interested in dollar signs saw a bleaker, longer film at first and got scared enough to ask for changes (or mandate changes). I'm clearly speculating, but if that's the case, shame on them. Shame on them anyways for giving us an inferior film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Thor The Dark World is good. Definitely an improvement to the first one. It had more action, its storyline was more interesting and the special effects were great. Marvel did a good job again on making movies. The storyline was interesting because of the new characters and the new worlds.It also gave us some new characters that are likable in a way. Another thing I liked in this movie is that it'll make you hyped from its coolness. Yes, there may be boring parts but those only takes a while.In conclusion, Thor The Dark World is good. It was such a satisfying movie. Now, I really can't wait its next sequel Thor Ragnarok.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It took me a while but I finally got to sit down long enough to watch Thor The Dark World which is a sequel to Thor (2011) and The Avengers where Thor also appears.And this time Thor will face his greatest challenge ever. Thor The Dark World takes a new twist as well as following the story line that took place in the Avengers.The film really took the effects to the extreme and the special effects are like watching the comic book come to life on screen really well time and show amazing talent. Chris Hemsworth, Tom Hiddleston, Natalie Portman, Jaimie Alexander, Anthony Hopkins, Idris Elba, Stellan Skarsgard all reprise their roles from the first movie and that's always good to see when you have the same cast return.But the plot for the film when you watch the film you understand why it was called The Dark World. It's good to see them mix humor with the story and they were clever with how to make the comedy, the drama is strong as well as each of the cast brings their best to the screen and of course the action is very well done as you see some of the most extreme fights in film What makes the film work is we get characters development that follows from The Avengers.The music in the film is superb with it helping telling the story of each scene for the film the action in the film is awesome and very well done plus you see how tough these characters are on their own.Again the Special effects are some of the most stunning I have seen in a film, the performance from the cast is a mix but they still deliver on the characters they bring to life and Marvel Fans will appreciate them for doing it.Thor The Dark World is a film that you have to watch it might not be highs of highs but it is still pure entertainment. With amazing special effects strong performances and a thrill ride you'll have a thundering good time I give Thor The Dark World an 8 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Enjoyable! But Not as Good as Its Predecessor</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me begin by saying that I'm writing this review as part of my Marvel Cinematic Universe review series as I'm watching all ten of the MCU films in preparation for "Avengers: Age of Ultron" which is set to come out in a couple of weeks. That being the case, I was excited to watch "Thor: The Dark World" because of the fact that my memory of this movie was that I enjoyed it a lot more than I did the original "Thor" movie based on my experience of seeing each of the films in theaters upon their original release. When I watched the first "Thor" for this review series, I found that it had really grown on me. So "The Dark World" surely would grow on me too, right?Sadly, I found that the second installment in the Thunder God's franchise was not as much of an improvement over its origin story as I recalled. Whereas the first "Thor" gained ground in my estimation, "The Dark World" came across a bit weaker than when I saw it in the theater.Before moving on, let me quickly say that I nevertheless do like the film, and find it to be a strong movie overall. You'll see that I've given it 8/10 stars. I had given the first "Thor" 9/10 in this review series, so "The Dark World" is just barely less enjoyable based on those rankings.That said, Thor 2 has its ups and downs. On the positive side of things, I really enjoyed the basic plot of this movie. We get to see Thor going back and forth between Asgard and Earth, just as we did in the first film. The relationship between Thor and Jane Foster is developed, Loki, Odin and the other Asgardians play crucial roles, and the time spent on Earth is much better used than in the first film. I found the Earth scenes in the first film to be a bit contrived, and almost came across as sort of an archetype of the standard "extra-terrestrials come to Earth and causes havoc" type of storyline. In Thor 2, the Earth scenes are much more developed, with the film's final Earth battle proving to be a robust climax of the film.Where the film suffers, however, is its poor character development for its main antagonists. This stands out since said characters play such a critical part in the film, and also because they are basically the only significant new character additions in the film at all, as most of the characters have been carried over from the first movie. As such, it's easy to keep up with Thor, Jane, Loki, Odin, etc. But the villains have very little back story, and very little in terms of developing their characters as the plot moves along. None of this is to say that you won't be able to keep up or follow the storyline--it's simply to say that the storyline will seem a bit trivial because the villains are at one and the same time underdeveloped and yet also portrayed to be egregiously evil. That kind of lack of character development makes the story seem a bit hollow, in spite of the fact that it's nevertheless a strong plot overall.All that said, I would again give the film 8/10 stars. This is another strong showing for the MCU, and a great film that is fun for anyone who is into the comic book genre of movies. It's also significant in that it foreshadows the already announced "Infinity War" direction that the MCU is headed in by showcasing one of the Infinity Stones, the Aether as a major part of the storyline. In summary, "The Dark World" falls short of perfection, but it's nevertheless fun and entertaining overall, and significant in the larger narrative of the MCU.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Marvel Fans Will Be Satisfied. Can't Say About The Rest.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The second trip to Asgard may not be as memorable or refreshing as the first time but it is still capable of leaving the majority of its audience sufficiently pleased for the filmmakers are well-aware of what made the first film click so well &amp; they deliver plenty of those elements in a more refined fashion yet when it comes to pure storytelling aspects, it's only as good as the original.A direct sequel to Thor &amp; the eight instalment in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Thor: The Dark World continues the story of its titular character &amp; covers the aftermath of the events that took place in The Avengers as Loki is brought to trial in Asgard &amp; is sentenced to life imprisonment but when an ancient enemy returns to finish an incomplete job, both brothers team up to save all the existing realms from falling into perpetual darkness.Directed by Alan Taylor, Thor: The Dark World opens on the same note as its predecessor i.e. with a prologue that foreshadows the events about to be unfolded in the story. The screenplay smears the surface of what it wanted to explore but never really tries to dig a little deeper. Visuals &amp; action offer a slight improvement than before, Cinematography rightly aims for a darker tone, the narrative is finely paced while Brian Tyler once again chips in with a good score.Coming to the performances, the cast that was put together in the first film continues to play a relevant role in this one except for a new villain who isn't intimidating at all. While a few of them are given more to do with their characters, some still manage to come off as annoying and frankly, the best thing about this sequel is the chemistry between Hemsworth &amp; Hiddleston as Thor &amp; Loki, respectively, as both are quite charismatic in their given roles, especially Hiddleston.On an overall scale, Thor: The Dark World half-heartedly tries to delve into a darker territory yet is filled with sequences that'll prevent its viewers from taking it seriously. Every scene featuring Tom Hiddleston only lifts the whole story up as even the wit applied in those brief moments work out brilliantly in the film's favour. I guess most Marvel fans will probably be satisfied with it but I can't say the same for newcomers because despite being an enjoyable &amp; entertaining ride for the masses, Thor: The Dark World still feels a bit hollow from the inside.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is again like the previous chapter too downrated. Want to remind that more than a superhero movie, The dark world seems a space-fantasy movie. This movie has much action, though I somehow managed to get bored at the end. The fact is that, just as Guardians of the galaxy, marvel space sci-fi overuses energy flares, beams and such... and that at the very end gets kinda annoying to me. Still, Thor: the dark world has enough humor, story, and good plot/action to overlook at this slight problem... I want to note down that toward the beginning we have a series of events that reminds deeply of the phenomenas described in the novel 'Roadside picnic' of the strugackij brothers, the original story that inspired Tarkovskij's eternal sci-fi classic, Stalker; therefore I really appreciated that maybe unwanted reference. Score is different than the first one, and I didn't like it that much. Overall, I liked the movie, not so much like other stuff, this is not at all a deep science fiction.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Yet another awesome Marvel sequel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Thor the Dark World in my opinion is another fantastic Marvel studios film, and like Iron Man 3 it doesn't deserve hate or bashing. Yes, to some it may feel like another filler movie u until 'Age of Ultron", that doesn't move the story of this shared universe any further at all, is a waste of time with a lackluster villain and mediocre plot. I respectively disagree to all but one of those points: the villain in this one was honestly pretty weak. He had very little motivation, little to no relate ability and was pretty wasted. That being said, its forgivable due to these points as to why the movie rocks--It's better than its predecessor: This is no knock on the first film. We loved it and the unsurprisingly Shakespearean feel of director Kenneth Branagh's introduction of the character. They've raised the stakes and was an all around better movie than the first, something that had yet to be done in a MCU sequel that wasn't The Avengers.-It's surprising: And those surprises don't feel cheap. Thor: The Dark World is unpredictable, and we guarantee that at least something will catch everyone off guard, especially THE surprise.-It's again filled with genuine humor: The film is packed full of jokes, and while some of them don't work (it's probably packed too full), the ones that do really do. It certainly isn't quite as funny as The Avengers, but then again it wasn't written by Joss Whedon. It's probably the second funniest in the MCU.-It utilizes its supporting characters: Everybody this time around has something to do. Granted, with the number of characters in the movie many of them don't have something to do for long, but it's very impressive how important so many characters ended up being. Even Frigga (wife of Oden) gets in on the action, and we can't help but be happy that Heimdall has a bit more screen time than expected. It touches our Idris Elba loving hearts.-It's full of action: This is no surprise given that Game of Thrones director Alan Taylor was brought in for the Thor sequel, but the action in this installment is more gritty and "realistic." The multi-realm final battle sequence was really cool, and it sure beats the finale from Thor.And for those 5 simple reasons, including the amazing casting, performances, chemistry between characters, effects and of course the Stan lee cameo are why Marvel still hasn't had a bad movie yet.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Yet another Marvel epic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Marvel Universe is without any doubt one of those Hollywood hypes I just can't get my head around. What is it that makes people fall in love with those superheroes who are no more than embodiments of the American value-system? And, even more so, why are the bad guys always in business with (semi-)communists, (Arabian) terrorists or evil (Russian or Asian) scientists? The clichés are too much for me. Maybe it's because I'm European. But that doesn't explain why so many Europeans dig this franchise. So maybe it has nothing to do with all that and it's just plain old Hollywood: looking for the greatest common divisor to capitalize on, in other words the best commercial formula for the highest profit. When realizing this it isn't all too bad to watch those Marvel films, 'cause it's only Hollywood numbness and as a viewer you just need to lower yourself to that level. It then also becomes possible to measure those movies against each other. When doing so the pattern - for me - gets quite clear: the second phase of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (Iron Man 3, Thor: The Dark World, Captain America: The Winter Soldier and Guardians of the Galaxy) is way better than the first one (which only had The Avengers that distinguished itself). I'm not anticipating any of the future Marvel films (at least 11 are in the running), but when seeking brainless entertainment, I suppose there's a lot worse out there.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Certainly far from a Marvel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie sucks. It's a shame as I quite like the Marvel Cinematic Universe and they've been consistent, but now the cracks are starting to show. There are only so many times we can see the same formula over and over again. This time, Thor deals with an alien invasion of earth and various other bland things happen. Thor The Dark World is a sequel to Thor, which wasn't a terrible film with its humour and character development, but it was a blockbuster built from anti-climaxes which devolved as it went along. This one is definitely worse and its contending with Iron Man 2 for the worst Marvel film to date. This is well acted up to a point, as Chris Hemsworth, Tom Hiddleston and Anthony Hopkins remain excellent. As usual, as an obscene amount of money is spent on these Marvel films, the special effects are excellent and you get the usual Marvel thrills and laughs, although in a more subdued way than normal. In a nutshell, TTDW is the Marvel formula done with far less effort.Another thing this suffers from are annoying human characters. Why on earth is an Oscar winner like Natalie Portman playing such a bland comic book girlfriend? None of the other characters are much fun either. It has a laughably bad villain who is some dark elf alien who not even Christopher Eccleston to make interesting. The action sequences are cardboard and lack any real dimension. They're just the same old stuff; plus haven't we seen enough of London getting destroyed in 2013 movies? In general, you don't feel most of the thrills and jokes and the story just goes the motions by half heartedly dumping crowd pleasing stuff such as jokes, fight scenes and special effects in there. When on earth, we get loads of annoying humans and when in space the film feels like a video game. TTDW isn't even a movie. It's a manufactured factory product coming off an assembly line, made purely for Marvel fanboys and Marvel fanboys alone. Lifeless and lacklustre, this effortless sequel takes the MCU to dark new places.4/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Hammer wielding superhero is back</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Thor: The Dark World is a comic book superhero movie that although maybe not containing the most thrilling of plot lines, still manages to churn out a fun film. With a lot of humour to add to the plot it could be said this is one superhero movie that doesn't always take itself so seriously and shows that Thor can do more than just one film. I felt by the end that it was a firmly OK movie and here below is why so.The story is kind of confusing like at times, it jumps from one thing to another and although you won't be lost, some scenes are fairly quick and dialogue can be missed. I did enjoy the action side of the film and the scenes shown containing fights etc are well laid out so that the film never gets to dull for the viewer. It tries to crack a few jokes here and there and they can be funny at times, if anything it lightens the movie up in parts.I found Chris Hemsworth to be good, not great but he does the job he is supposed to do and it has to be said he is well choreographed all the way through. Natalie Portman is OK but can maybe seem just slightly under acting but is usually saved by fellow cast members. Tom Hiddleston well I wasn't too sure on him in this second instalment, I felt he tried too hard to be the big sinister guy in certain scenes and although by the end he has done an OK job, still just a little over the top.It is well directed and to say the effects are so big and expansive in this movie, Alan Taylor seems to finish this up well. I wasn't always too keen on the script whilst watching and although I think it improves as the movie progresses, it still could do with a few tweaks here and there. On the point of effects, they are everywhere it would seem but not bad at all and contribute very well to the thrills felt throughout the film.The main negativity coming from this is the way in which it has too much a complicated plot that isn't a smart one, I mean that in the sense that it could be intelligent and well thought out but by the end the story seems to be only about attracting box office receipts. Wasn't also always too keen on the acting side but people such as Hemsworth really start to regain control of that part of the film and stop it fading badly.For the fan of superheroes or comics, this could be said to be not the best of them but still highly recommend if you really want a lot of action with an epic back story. If your not a fan I would still say go and see, it has a certain air of comedic charm which kind of make it feel a bit different to other such films and not always trying to be too serious.Overall I felt It to be Firmly Pleasing and a film that never quite loses the aim of the game. My review may seem very negative indeed but in many cases it is not bad, hugely enjoyable in parts, confusing but fun in others this is one Superhero movie that could by the very end, very much split opinion among people.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With the main Marvel players established as film franchises. Marvel turned to their second tier with Thor and Captain America, if their desire to make the Avengers film was to become a real possibility.Kenneth Branagh was entrusted to get Thor of the ground. The Shakespearean actor and director was a left field choice that turned out to be an inspired and bold move.Now with the sequel, we go back to the land of Tolkienism with elves and the age of darkness. Before the reign of 'Odin' (Anthony Hopkins) the Dark Elves were led by 'Malekith' (Christopher Eccleston) who craved the energy source called 'Aether.'Although Malkieth was initially unsuccessful a rare convergence means he can begin his task again to grab this energy source so he can destroy once again.It is up to Thor to stop him and he might need to get Loki to assist him. The action moves from Asgard to Greenwich which seems the London location of choice for many US blockbusters in the last few years. Loki making his third appearance in a Marvel film get the best lines, Eccleston the actor responsible for the relaunch of Doctor Who gets little to do or show his skill because Loki has all the focus.The film despite its action, special effects and CGI is just average. Entertaining but instantly forgettable, but the film leaves you with a set up for a third film because even Norse legend/superheros can be dumb by trusting any stranger with there powerful artefacts.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Before the reign of "Odin" (Anthony Hopkins) the Dark Elves were led by a malicious being known as "Malekith" (Christopher Eccleston) who craved an extremely powerful energy source known as the "Aether". In his attempt to get it (in order to destroy the universe) war broke out between the Dark Elves and Aasgard which ended up in the Dark Elves being annihilated and the Aether buried forever. Or so everybody thought. As it so happens Malekith managed to escape and due to a rare convergence of the realms the Aether has become uncovered. And Malekith wants it badly. The only problem is that "Jane Foster" (Natalie Portman) has not only discovered it but it has also infected her very soul. Recognizing Jane's serious plight Thor takes her to Aasgard for medical care. So in order for Malekith to acquire the Aether he now has to battle all of Aasgard in the process. Anyway, rather than detail the entire story and risk spoiling the picture for those who haven't seen it I will just say that this was a very good movie which had plenty of action and humor throughout. In all honesty though I thought there were some parts which seemed to drag a bit while other parts went overboard with the graphic action. In any case, this was quite enjoyable and I rate it as above average.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautiful photography</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Since the first film was based mostly on Earth, we never got to explore Asgard. Well, we get to do that here, and Asgard is breathtakingly beautiful. Looking in part like an ancient city, you get lost in the imagery especially during the battle scenes. The photography is done so beautifully you do not feel jarred seeing futuristic fighters amidst ancient-looking buildings and longboats that fly and shoot lasers. And the various panoramic scenes of a spaceship in the middle of London were well-done too.The fight scenes could have been choreographed better though - at times, I wondered why a technologically advanced race was still fighting with swords and shields while wearing non-functional capes when their defence systems shoot lasers and put up force fields. Asgard is supposed to be the ruling realm but its soldiers fight with swords and shields against laser guns and mini black holes? I'm also surprised its fortress is so easily overpowered - you'd have expected even stone walls and columns in Asgard to have a greater degree of resilience. If the fight scenes were better choreographed, I'd most likely be awed enough to enjoy them rather than think about them.I'm glad to see Heimdall having an expanded role in this film. I did not read the comics, so I was intrigued by the power and responsibility wielded by him, being supposedly able to even deny the King of Asgard entry into his realm. It's great to see him doing much more in this film other than guarding the Bifrost like in the last movie.Loki's banter is delightfully enjoyable as usual. And I especially enjoyed the short scene where he was changing his and Thor's forms so as to be "less conspicuous". Apart from the visuals, the story was engaging enough. The plot moves fast, keeping one engaged and interested till the end of the film. Some cheesy lines at the end of the film, but they were to be expected. All in all, a very pretty picture-story backed by a credible plot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worth the rental</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Overall, I think this was a good movie to watch with the family. It had the typical good guy versus bad guy with the girlfriend in jeopardy. I did not think the plot was as engaging as the first movie, but it was still captivating enough that I sat and watched without leaving the room for popcorn or snacks. My son really loves the action and adventure of the show and thought the fight scenes were "really cool!" The scenes with the crazy professor made the kids laugh and it was comical to see the interaction between the intern and her intern. I think Natalie Portman's character needed more substance, but it was definitely worth the Redbox rental.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thor: The Dark World is a pleasantly funny and action-packed movie, it's way better than the first one and is another great film from Marvel.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wow, Marvel is blowing up right now! They keep on making these awesome movies back-to-back, this year we have another Captain America and the new Guardians of The Galaxy, then we have Ultron in 2015! So cool! Anyway, I think Thor: The Dark World was a really cool movie, let's get into it:The acting in the movie is pretty decent, Christ Hemsworth is great as Thor, I really like his "NOOOOO" screams, they are awesome, and he was really funny too. I didn't really like the mortal characters though, Natalie Portman wasn't exactly good in this movie, I absolutely love her as an actress though, her sidekicks, Darcy and the intern were pretty bad, their "subplot" wasn't thought out at all, and their humor was just off timing. Selvig however was great, Anthony Hopkins was good too. But of course the highlight was Loki, Tom Hiddleston is absolutely amazing as Thor's brother, he jokes a lot more in this movie, and his fight scenes were very good. I don't think that this will happen, but that guy deserves at least an Oscar nomination, I mean, the guy steals every scene he's in!The writing in the movie was really fun, I noticed that Marvel is really putting a lot of humor into these Phase 2 films, I mean in Iron Man 3 (great movie), you could really see that they focused more on the comedy, the plot twist was really funny, and in this sequel, they once again made it really funny, most of the jokes worked really well, (except for Darcy and Jane), As I mentioned, Thor was hilarious in the movie, the scene in the subway was great, the part where he hangs Mjolnir was awesome as well. The writing is overall pretty good, the story is better than the first movie too, because we get to see him as a god.The art design of the movie was decent as well, just like the other aspects of it. The ships I found were a bit weird, but Asgard looked great, like a royal city.I really liked the soundtrack of the movie, there were some really good sad songs, only one track though, however it was good, cause it sounds like something that should be in a superhero movie.The effects in the movie were dazzling, just like in Iron Man 3 (though they were different of course), the Aether looked great, Thor's lightning looked great, the ships were the weak point though, both in design and effects, they looked pretty fake. But otherwise they were very good. The funeral was absolutely beautiful, one of the best parts of the movie. Thor: The Dark World is really great, if you liked Iron Man 3, you'll probably like this one too, I was surprised to see how good a sequel this is, make sure you watch this, it's a funny, electrifying and action packed superhero film, and I give it a 9.1/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another fantasy/sci-Fi film exceeding reviews</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film falls into the class of fantasy/sci-films FAR better than critics would lead you to believe. This is far more ambitious than the original Thor, with a far more clever script. Tom Hiddleston can always be relied upon for solid villainy; he is appropriately used. Christopher Eccleston is a well known British actor who has impressed me in everything he has done since Shekhar Kapur's Elizabeth. The dynamic between Thor and Jane Foster is less interesting than between Thor and Loki. The whole plot about how dark elves are trying to commandeer this protean "Aether" to somehow re-immerse the universe into "dark matter" probably had actual experts like Sean Carroll rolling their eyes. But who cares? A British stage actor plays a bad guy trying to destroy the universe, while the good guys try and stop him. This is a solid escapist film with lots of good actors having fun, and more than a fair share of witty moments. This film could have probably fallen short with inferior editing. I feel this stands as a legit film independent of the Avengers' juggernaut. Two other fantasy/sci-fi films also, IMHO, which far better then critical reviews were the Hobbit (lots of a abuse: why??) and, surprisingly, Oblivion. I finished this film very pleasantly surprised with how well it worked.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great movie! 8/10</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Review: This is a very well made movie that covers every aspect of a super-hero movie. The storyline was well put together by the director and the whole look and feel of the film is great. All of the actors put in great performances, especially Chris Hemsworth who plays Thor extremely well. The storyline follows on from the previous Thor and The Avengers, which was a great choice by the director, and I'm glad that they showed a different side to Loki. The only downside to the movie is that the director tried to compact so much information into one film, so you really do have to concentrate with what is going on, but that's not to say that it confusing or misguiding. If your a fan of the comics, you won't be disappointed, and if you don't know that much about Thor, you still be entertained and interested in the story that unfolds. Great Movie!Round-Up: I was a bit dubious about the director bringing back Natalie Portman, but once she goes back to Asgard, she reminded me of when she was in Star Wars, playing Princess Leah's mum. Anyway, I really can't see anyone else playing Thor but Chris Hemsworth who adds a certain type of cockiness and wit to the comic book hero. All of the directors are doing well with the Avengers franchise, but I must admit, I am waiting for a Hulk movie after seeing Mark Ruffalo playing the part well. In all, this is a movie that has something for everyone. With amazing action, storyline and humour, this is a movie not to be missed.Budget: $170million Worldwide Gross: $641millionI recommend this movie to people who are into comic book hero movies and who are fans of the Thor franchise. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thor: The Dark World is an enjoyable superhero movie. If only it were more...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Thor: The Dark World is a movie I have been waiting for a long time. I really enjoyed the first (no matter how average people thought it) and the trailer for the sequel looked awesome. And I hoped it was awesome. Was it awesome? Almost. This movie takes place a few years after The Avengers. The nine realms are at peace until all of a sudden, evil is released. Best synopsis ever. As plots go, it's pretty good. It stays true to the superhero formula and has a couple of plot twists. One is a complete surprise, one is completely predictable. However, there are a lot of plot holes in this movie. Often in the movie, I was scratching my head thinking, "Wait, how would that work?" That kind of detracts from the movie a little. Now, I'm going to be straight with you. For the first forty minutes or so, I was thinking, "Okay, this movie is having a hard time going anywhere." Yeah, it starts out rough. The beginning of the movie starts out rather dull. It had a hard time pulling me in and keeping me invested. But, when things started going down and punches were thrown, that's when things got interesting. It turned out to be a fun movie, but I wish it had the same charm from the beginning. Speaking of charm, this movie is very funny. It's the funniest Marvel movie since The Avengers (which isn't saying much because the only other Marvel movie that came out after The Avengers is Iron Man 3, but it's still the funniest). There were chuckle moments and even moments that had me laughing out loud. However, there were some jokes that felt stale. Most of them came from Kat Denning's character. I think she's very cute, but she didn't really have that much of a point in this movie. The action is what you'd except in a superhero movie; action packed awesomeness. And that's what this movie has. It was just cool seeing Thor wipe out a bunch of people with his hammer. IT'S SO SATISFYING! Overall, this movie is good. It isn't quite as good as the original Thor, but I still enjoyed it. It's definitely a worthy successor to The Avengers and it's definitely worth checking out. And it has not only an awesome Stan Lee cameo, but also an awesome cameo of a certain Avenger. No spoilers, just saying.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Another hit by Marvel and with Captain America: The Winter Soldier looking awesome so far, Marvel The Avengers Phase two is looking pretty good. This was an improvement from Thor 1 in almost every way. The story was your typical Superhero story but it was executed properly which made for a great viewing. The Marvel humor is also present thoroughly in this movie. They timed it rightly and it even made me laugh out loud during some moments. There were also nods to the Avengers universe here and there, which makes these movies all the more fun as it is all connected and what not. Marvel has certainly hit a Jackpot ever since they decided to do this from 2008.Almost all the cast from Thor 1 was back, which was good too see. Chris Hemsworth delivered a great performance as Thor yet again. His character development is good and you can see how much he has changed since Thor 1. BUT I'll have to say, the star of the show is LOKI. He just nails it every time he is on screen. Tom Hiddleston as Loki is probably one of the best casting decision ever. He is one of my favourite character of this Marvel Avengers universe. And the WTF/Awesome ending of this movie just made the wait to see him again a lot harder. The side characters are good too, whether it is for comic relief or other stuff. Mainly Darcy, she is funny and its good they kept her. The action sequences were really good and very entertaining. The CGI was nice and much improved from Thor 1. There was a lot more action too this time, and rightly paced too, which made the movie an entertaining experience through and through. As it is common with Marvel movies, be sure to check out the two after credits scene. I can't wait for Captain America: The winter soldier now. Must watch for any fan of the Marvel movies. 8.2/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thor: The Dark World</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think I had the perfect viewing experience. Wednesday I watched the first Thor movie; then Thursday afternoon I watched the Avengers, before going to see The Dark World Thursday night. I've also been playing the "Avengers Assemble" Facebook game, which prepared me brilliantly for the movie. It's one of the great joys of the transmedia empire that is the Marvel Cinematic Universe. In the Facebook game, the newest Spec Ops mission has Kurse, Dark Elves, and several other elements from the movie. I'm not too familiar with this part of Thor's canon, but being even slightly introduced to these parts of the story via this game made the movie that much more enjoyable.It's hard to put into words just how much I enjoyed Thor: The Dark World. It was everything a Thor movie should be, and then some. In the first movie, I found myself wishing for more time exploring the Nine Worlds. I also found it hard to care about Asgard and wishing for more time on Earth. This time, not only did I get to see Thor and his Asgardians wrapping up their campaign to establish peace throughout the Nine Worlds, but I also got to see a brilliant before-the-dawn-of-time story. The story made me care about Asgard even more than Midgard (Earth), to the point where, not only did the setting not matter, but I found the scale tilted the other way, where I wanted more Asgard than Earth. Although, Jane Foster and her Phoenix-esque possession by the Aether provided the link for me (as for Thor) back to Earth, and I found myself loving the story that much more.It was the most fun I've had at the movies since the Avengers. Everything about it was done masterfully, and I can't wait to watch it again! Not only did they do everything I wished they had done in the first Thor movie, and do it better than I ever imagined they would, they also took some of my favorite elements from other movies and perfected them.Ever since seeing the kids mess with the malfunctioning matrix in Beyond, a short film, part of the Animatrix from 10 years ago, I've been subconsciously wanting to see this squishy gravity concept played out better on the big screen. I got this wish fulfilled in The Dark World. Watching the kids, Jane, Darcy, and Ian throw stuff into the weird anti-gravitational field in the abandoned warehouse was super neat-o. Then, when Thor and Malekith were fighting and warping and teleporting between worlds, with "Mew-Mew" (Mjolnir) frantically trying to find its way across the galaxies and back to its master's hand, I was blown away. This fight couldn't have been better! Ian slamming the car down on the Elves was just icing.With the Man of Steel a few months ago, a bit of my yearning for the epic super-powered battle that Dragon Ball Z perfected was satiated. But Thor versus Malekith took epic fights to a whole nother level! The timing of The Dark World's release couldn't have been better, with Man of Steel coming to Blu-Ray this Tuesday. There is no competition! Seeing Thor flying through the air like that with his electrified hammer, as he came crashing down into Malekith to teleport him away, I actually believed he was the god of thunder. I dare say I've never seen a better epic battle.I also loved how they continued to play with Arthur C. Clarke's notion that "magic is just science that we don't understand yet". Jane's back and forth with the healers about the "quantum field generator" versus "soul forge" was just one little example of this. The forcefields both in the prisons and over the capitol were another. It was especially amusing watching Thor and Loki try to figure out how to make Malekith's ship work. There were many other wonderful parts of maybe science-fiction / maybe magic that made the movie just that much better.During the part when Thor and Loki are escaping from Asgard, I couldn't help but think back to some of the now-lame space battles from Star Wars and how much better this was than that! Even some of the sound effects were the same. I know it's difficult to say anything is better than Star Wars, but, I have to admit, Malekith's fleet was cooler than any of the ships from the former.So many other good parts to this movie. Too much for my feable mind to have remembered after only one viewing. Thor: The Dark World was such a fun, fantastical, beautiful, amazing movie. I can't wait to watch it again!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More Thor action this time around</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I enjoyed the first Thor film more than I was expecting, but I enjoyed this one even more. This is probably due to the fact that Thor had all his godly powers throughout the entire film. In fact, the first film played out a lot like a second superhero film as many times in the sequel to a comic book character the superhero will lose his powers at some point. The second Superman with Christopher Reeves and Spider-man 2 are examples of this. This one simply had Thor with all his powers on display and more scenes in Asgard and a unique Earth setting of London rather than the standard New York that made me enjoy this one more the the previous film and a bit more than the third Ironman released earlier this year.The story has some strange race of beings called the Dark Elves being awoken by a strange event that could spell the end of all realms if the Dark Elves have their way. Thor's love interest Jane Foster, comes into contact with this strange power and is soon the target of Malekith, leader of the Dark Elves. Thor takes Jane to Asgard despite opposition from his father Odin, but this will prove a costly move as the elves invade Asgard. Soon Thor must work with his brother Loki to lure the elves into a trap and save not only Earth and Asgard, but all realms in the universe.Once again the action is great this time and there is a lot more of it. My favorite parts though involved the scenes with Loki and Thor's uneasy alliance. This was interesting and funny at the same time. Anthony Hopkins returns as Odin and does a superb job as he usually does and Jane Foster's friends return in this one too, though with varying degrees of success as both are merely used for comic relief here.So, overall, I enjoyed this sequel more than the first film. I liked the action, Thor and Loki's interactions and the settings and look of the film. There is also sure to be a sequel considering how this one ended. There was an extra scene after a few credits role by, but it seemed so out of place from the rest of the film. I know it is a lead in for the Guardians of the Galaxy film, this is probably due to the fact I am just not really familiar with that particular comic franchise. All in all, it was nice to see a movie as there really was nothing I was really interested in seeing since July. I needed some filler as there may not be another film I want to see until next April! So nice comic action for the end of the year!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Thorful, But Not Thorsome Either</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Thor: The Dark World expands on the beloved Marvel Cinematic Universe, quite literally, this time with one of the least exciting Avengers taking the spotlight for Hammertime.Despite the devoted fan-base of this incredible world of Marvel superheroes, you can't help but feel that Thor: The Dark World is the first instalment in the franchise to feel most contrived and out of place. Yet, this sequel is still a mild improvement on its predecessor, though together they combine for the weakest in the series of superhero films, even though Thor is probably the strongest out of the bunch. The film finds Thor doing his thing in Asgard, before his lady love Jane Foster conveniently stumbles upon a weapon known as the Aether, which the Dark Elf Malekith intends to use to destroy the universe. Asleep yet?Negativity aside, Thor: The Dark World is a mostly enjoyable comic-book flick with some superb action, actors and, I can't think of another word that begins with 'a' so, humour.For an incredibly cheesy character, Chris Hemsworth still has the oh my demigod factor to bring a great balance of confidence, charisma and physicality to the role of Thor. This can be said of all of the Asgardians, including Anthony Hopkins as Odin and Tom Hiddleston's fan- favourite portrayal of Loki. While narratively Thor: The Dark World is predominantly yawn-inspiring, the presence of Hiddleston's Loki compensates as fans are genuinely interested to see his current personality and relationship with Thor following the events of The Avengers in 2012. It is the human characters that are the dull, annoyingly cheesy and unnecessary obstacles that often get in the way of the overall pleasant 112 minute sequel. Notably, Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) is used as a pathetic damsel in distress signal masquerading as a character with any significance, while Darcy Lewis (Kat Dennings) is pretty much the idiotic joke machine waiting for her cue. These characters, along with the contrived villain Malekith (Christopher Eccleston) are really the Aether to what could have been a very promising second outing for Thor. With no disrespect to these actors whom deliver fine performances, it is their characters that suppress absolute enjoyment of Thor: The Dark World.Apologies for this tennis match I am having with myself in complementing and then hammering Thor: The Dark World's qualities; still I'll continue to play. More positively, the film is possibly the greatest comedic achievement for the superhero squadron on screen to date. One moment had the audience in an uproar of laughter; those that have seen it will know the moment, and those that are yet to see the film will know when they bear witness to its hilarity. Even during other scenes where the humour feels slightly inappropriate given the circumstances, you'll easily yield with laughter, or at the minimum, a low-key grin.It's almost superfluous today to commend a modern blockbuster for its CGI quality. However due to its stark visual improvement over its 2011 predecessor, Thor: The Dark World is certainly worth mentioning as an aesthetically potent force which makes the movie a Thorful lot of fun!Whilst the Thorsome Asgardian actors, humour and visual effects are enough to keep Marvel fans entertained for two short hands around the clock, it doesn't take too long to realise that Thor: The Dark World is probably the most forgettable and forced in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, though by no means the first for Marvel (I'm looking at you 'Amazing' Spider-Man). Thor's lack of character development since the end of Thor, along with the villain out of nowhere and no care Malekith make this sequel feel pretty purposeless in the grander scheme of things. And that's not even mentioning Jane Foster: Marvel's version of Daphne from Scooby-Doo, except more pointless, boring, unconvincing and no fun for anyone.After a Thortless and needlessly dull opening 45 minutes, Thor: The Dark World has plenty of surprises along the way to amuse the fandom inside of devotees, that'll shadow its flaws until you really start to think about the film, but it's some fun while it lasts.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as Character driven, but it makes up with better action sequences</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Thor: The Dark World" does not so much pick up on the events following its predecessor for it tells its own separate story. The focus is on another old enemy of Asgaard, the Dark Elves who possess a long since lost artifact called the Eather?which grants virtually indestructible power to a living host. While Thor brings peace and attempts to unite the 9 worlds of the universe, the Dark Elves arise and plan to blanket everything in darkness. Breaking away from a simple rehashing of the first film's plot is refreshing and advantageous, for it introduces a new perspective of this universe that non-Marvel Comic savvy persons like myself are unfamiliar with. At the same time, the movie retains all the characters and their personalities from the previous flick?Thor, Jane Foster, Dr. Selvig, Odin, Frigga, Heimdall, and even the science intern Darcy and Loki.New faces are added too. Jonathan Howard plays the intern's intern Ian. And Chris Eccleston plays Malekith?the leader of the Dark Elves. Both are effective in their roles, however, their purpose to the overall story is rather vague. Ian is pretty much a sidekick of sorts, but he doesn't really achieve much as a character, other than flipping a car on some dark elves and making out with one of the girls. The motives for the Malekith character are left unanswered. So he is a villain who wants to rule the universe. Okay. Why? Revenge? Insanity? There is no explanation. The only conclusion I can come up with is from him floating around in space hibernation for 5,000 years. I guess the solitude finally got to him. More meaningless actions brought questions to my mind during the film's progression, such as why the Asgaardian soldiers brought spears and shields to a laser rifle fight or how F-18s suddenly appear to try and destroy the enemy spaceship on earth. I'm probably taking this film too seriously when a movie such as this is anything but that. Nevertheless, some plausibility has to be present in order to suspend the viewer's disbelief. Unfortunately, this movie fails a bit here. More amusing is how the movie tries to be technical and intelligent about the sciences behind the Eather, the space portals, and the "convergence" between the different planets. Science fiction is fun but it needs limitations for the viewers' sake. What does make "Thor 2" memorable though is the action sequences. They are abundant, long, gigantic in scale, and over the top entertaining. The Dark Elves onslaught against Asgaard is particularly fascinating to watch on the big screen. I enjoyed myself despite its ridiculousness and I can never resist the charms of the cast, especially Stellen Skaarsgard as the crazier than average Dr. Selvig, Kat Dennings as the quirky Darcy, Natalie Portman as the adorable Jane Foster, and Tom Hiddleston as the deceptive Loki. I also liked that Stan Lee and Chris Evans deliver minor comedic cameos. Characters and action is what this kind of movie needs and "Thor 2" has both. Too bad it is not nearly as character driven as the original Thor, but the ending makes up a little with a good twist. So pay close attention.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lots of Ideas, Not Fully Explored</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Thor: The Dark World is a big step for Marvel Studios. The movie marks the first of several projects that is not an origin story, The Avengers or Iron Man. Everyone loves a good origin story but these next films will determine if the individual Marvel movie style can continue. First up to bat: Thor.Picking up directly after the events of The Avengers, Thor: The Dark World brings us back to Asgard where Loki (Tom Hiddleston) is imprisoned for his attempted conquering of Earth in The Avengers. Also, it is revealed that his brother Thor's (Chris Hemsworth) visit to Earth in The Avengers was part of an ongoing war he is waging to bring peace to the nine realms. Thor is continuing this crusade in beginning of The Dark World but he is interrupted when his mortal love, Jane Foster (Natalie Portman), discovers an ancient evil known as the Aether and the Dark Elves awaken to steal the Aether for their own diabolical uses. Thus begins the epic.To keep it short and spoiler-free, the movie is fun. It tops the first Thor in action and humor. Marvel movie creators have fine tuned their wry sense of comedy where characters are nonchalant in the face of danger and it still cracks people up. Where it stumbles, though, is in character development. The movie is just so full of plot that it has no choice but to throw it all at the audience as quickly as possible. This, unfortunately, results in a lack of simple seemingly insignificant scenes that actually build emotion and connections between the characters. A good example would be the Dwarfs' slow but entrancing singing scene from The Hobbit which threw in a dash of culture and brotherhood between the adventurers. There are scenes like that but it feels like half of them are missing or more time could have been dedicated to them. Hopefully, a director's cut will amend this.This rush also affects Loki. Loki is a great trickster, master of illusion and deception. Hiddleston has nailed the part down to a menacing glare and he has secured a seat as the main villain. But due to the film's speed, the audience doesn't have enough time to grow to trust him enough to be shocked by his next move. It feels more like a waiting game to see what he'll do next. Despite the fandom for Loki, the movie decided to push him to the side for a one note, evil for the sake of evil, Malekith, leader of the Dark Elves (Christopher Eccleston). Perhaps they're waiting use him in Thor 3. They certainly gave a very nice setup for the next chapter in a twist that will make everyone, once again, eager to see what will happen next.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For the Dark World, eight stars seems a bit high, however seven stars is definitely too low. Let me put the weakest elements of this film out first. Emotionally, this film rarely connects as much as the first film. Thor does not receive any noticeable development. Characters like Siv were underutilized and the villain was forgettable. The comedy dosage is a bit too high as well. In these ways, it falters behind the first movie.In other ways, in most other ways, this film is actually an improvement over the first. It's an all around solid film with good pacing and memorable scenes. I'm sure many people were glad to see a fully powered Thor for so much of the movie. The main attraction though is Loki, who, in tradition, steals all the scenes. In fact, Loki's character is written better than ever in this film. The rest of the movie which is at least good, pales in comparison to any scenes with him. There is a noticeable spike in writing quality when Loki is on screen. Thor is also at his best when interacting with Loki.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The cinematic equivalent of wearing all your favourite clothes at once.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Kenneth Branagh's take on Thor (2011) was a surprising departure for him but it worked. The sequel, Thor: The Dark World, works less well. It's entertaining, there's plenty of noise and digital effects, but it's the cinematic equivalent of wearing all your favourite clothes at once.Like the original, it is credited to two directors: TV director for hire, Alan Taylor and James Gunn, who was partly responsible for the execrable Movie 43. Presumably the producers realized from the outset that it was too unwieldy for one man to handle alone. What a pity they didn't do something about it before production began.When the Dark Elves, a race hitherto thought to be extinct, rock up and have a go at trashing Asgard, Odin (Anthony Hopkins) is decidedly narked and sends Thor (Chris Hemsworth) and friends to sort the mess out. Thor decides the best ally to have is his bother, Loki (Tom Hiddleston), releases him from prison, sets off to Earth for some quality time in the company of old friends, including Jane (Natalie Portman), and redesigns Greenwich.Thor: The Dark World isn't a poor film, it's just messy and has been loaded with far too many ingredients to be fully cohesive or comprehendible. It's part sci-fi fantasy, part Harry Potter, part Lord of the Rings, has a smidgen of slapstick humour, a dollop of action, makes a half-hearted attempt at profundity and has been haphazardly stirred with shovel. We know there should be something in it for everyone but it's not quite possible to discern exactly what that something is.The fanboys will love it, those with a penchant for all things superhero will want to tick it off their 'must-see' list and parents seeking a diversion for bored kids could do far worse than to sit through two hours of this pleasurable mayhem.Thor: The Dark World is big, loud and chaotic but it's fun. Just don't expect to be moved or to be able to explain it all the following day.For more reviews from The Squiss, subscribe to my blog and like the Facebook page.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great fight scenes, but a weak villain.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Thor: The Dark World is packed with great action scenes, which is what you get when you add Alan Taylor to the mix. There is no shaky cam, which I find tends to get a bit disorienting, and the camera has you right in the middle of all the battles. There is also a lot of humour, more so than in the first instalment of Thor. But I do have a couple of gripes about this film. At the start of the film, which deals with a bit of Asgardian history, Thor's grandfather hides the Aether where "no-one will ever find it." You'd think then that some human scientist wouldn't stumble across it very easily not even half an hour into the film. Also, the villain Malekith was very disappointing. Christopher Eccleston did a good job, but there is no back-story to Malekith, his motives are never fully explained, the audience doesn't get a true sense of who he is, his power is underplayed (I thought) and all in all he's just a rather weak antagonist. Finally, Darcy. Annoying, not particularly funny, adds nothing to the film, I just don't know why she's there. And the intern has as intern? Okay, whatever. But apart from that, I really enjoyed it, great action, and a rather satisfying ending.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This film suggests Thor can't live without Loki and should really be saved for The Avengers' movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Marvel Phase Two is fully underway now with the second instalment of the section coming in the form of Thor: The Dark World. Kenneth Brannagh has vacated the director's seat and Game of Thrones' Alan Taylor has replaced him with the principle cast all returning, including that scene stealing tycoon Tom Hiddleston.This time out Thor must reconcile with the un-too-happy Jane, who is fully aware he graced his presence on Earth during The Avengers (perhaps like the rest of the world she saw it in her local cinema) and enlist the help of brother Loki to stop the evil Maliketh who has threatened to destroy all nine realms of the universe. The plot is utter nonsense, like we expect from superhero films, but it lends itself to what director Taylor does best; epic battle sequences. Compared to its predecessor this is bigger, bolder and badder with Christopher Ecclestone bringing a darker baddie in the evil Lord Maliketh. Despite the obvious lift from the original this does however feel like a weaker movie. The action scenes are meatier (you expect nothing less from Taylor) but the story has given way because of this, something Brannagh was good at. It is as if the Thor series needs a cross between both directors to really bring through a better movie. Perhaps someone like Joss Whedon, I don't think he's too busy at the moment. Instead what we have with this sequel is an emotionless narrative that allows Loki to shine through once again. We can't help but wonder that if the character was omitted from the films that they would cease to be made. Hiddleston's appearance is briefer than previous outings but he still manages to bring the charm and humour that the first one also had. There is also an excellent and somewhat unusual performance, from Stellan Skarsgard who is a much different character to what we remember. He is also charged with bringing through the humour and via these two characters we are given a film that breaks up epic battles with comedic one liners and scenarios. This gives the film a frustratingly noticeable tonal shift throughout which eliminates any emotional impact the film may have had. Around the half way point a potentially emotional scene takes place but the choice of scenes that surround it fail to lead into and out of it. The editing makes it jumpy and there is little room to settle into one tone before jumping into another.In comic books superheroes are faced with a host of villains. Some are noteworthy and some are trash receptacle fodder. Unfortunately Marvel appears to have picked the latter of the two in their choice of Maliketh. His motives are never explored and his involvement adds little to the plot other than to bring Thor and Loki together.The plot is where the film is really let down. By the time the epic climax takes place (a well constructed battle in Greenwich) the story isn't up to speed and there must have been a scene or two cut that would have brought us emotionally to this level. It is all rather rushed with too many stories being nipped in order to gain more Loki. Even encounters with Jane are skimped on but I can't see this as an issue due to her being a highly unlikeable character. The problem with Thor is that without Loki the character has little going for him but with Loki plot strands are under developed or merely Macguffin's to bring Loki into the story. It makes us question as to whether Thor is really a strong enough character to hold his own movie in the way Tony Stark/Iron Man is. For me he isn't.Thor: The Dark World is a disappointment to the Marvel universe. It is probably slightly better than the original film but that was a weak instalment also. The tone throughout both films alters and it is as if no one really knows what to do with the character. There is suggestion a third movie will be on the way but if Loki isn't around it could fall flat on its face and if he is it may feel repetitive. Perhaps it is time for Thor to hang up the hammer until the Avengers come calling.Rating: 2.5 / 5Directing: The battle scenes are awesome but the emotional elements have little impact. Acting: Hemsworth is fine; Portman is flat so it is a good job Hiddleston is still on form.Script: I can't help but think the script has been altered throughout production.Cinematography: The film looks great (Asgaard especially) and the epic final battle is breathtaking.Score: Adds to the battle sequences.Editing: At times it is far too pacy and doesn't allow the quieter moments to sink in. Overall: Not one of Marvel's finest and raises the question of Thor's ability to carry an entire movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The costume design was excellent. I would have loved for Thor to be a little more buff.I totally agree with this review I read on another site 'At the beginning of the film there's a battle that could fit in a "Lord of the Rings" film, and the costumes and Asgardian culture have a medieval influence. However, you also can see very futuristic spaceships darting through the skies, and there's a great action sequence that features a fight between Thor and Malekith where the characters are jumping through portals between worlds almost faster than you can keep track'</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Lightning does not strike twice with the follow up to 2011's THOR. Thor The Dark World does not live up to the standard set by its predecessor. Although it ups the ante with the action, it lacks that personal focus of the first movie. Thankfully, a stellar cast and amazing chemistry saves the movie from falling into mindless blockbuster territory.With a combined movie universe, it begs the question of how come other heroes do not appear to intervene in the various world shattering crises that other heroes face in their individual movies. THOR: THE DARK WORLD provides just such an explanation by setting most of its action off earth. After the events of AVENGERS, Thor leads an Asgardian force to bring peace back to the 9 realms. On earth Jane Foster, Thor's love interest from the first film, stumbles on an anomalous place with portals that transports items, and herself, to another world; the so called "Dark World". There, she unwittingly bonds with an ancient weapon of tremendous power called the Aether. This alerts the evil Dark Elves, technologically advanced ancient enemies of Asgard, and their leader Malekith.As villains go, Malekith and his Dark elves are no where as memorable as one would have hoped. Like a crossbreed of LORD OF THE RINGS's Uruk-Hai with STAR WAR's Sith Lords and Clone Troopers. They have superpowered "Kursed" warriors, who are like Berserkers on steroids, they have space age technology centered around the manipulation of gravity (and novel use of mini-black hole grenades); all these are quite cool but seem to clash with the more fantasy-tech of Asgard. Malekith himself is a one note villain who is out to destroy all realms. Zero depth, zero development. Then again, what do you expect? He is not the star of this movie.What Thor The Dark World succeeds very much in is its world building. It crafts and expands upon the Marvel movie universe, adding much needed history and depth to the people of Asgard. This depth extends to the characters; this time focused mainly on the relationship between Thor, Loki and their parents. While Chris Hemsworth does a marvellous job as a heroic yet humble Thor, Tom Hiddelston is magnificent as Loki. He just oozes nuance in his performance, portraying the trickster as a truly tormented soul torn between the love for his mother and the hatred for his brother. You never know his true intentions or where his loyalties lie. If anything, this is more of a Loki movie than a Thor movie where your tragic villain outshines the titular character, stealing every scene he is in.Sadly, this leads to all the problems inherent in the movie. THOR: THE DARK WORLD has a great story. Yet its execution is muddled in direction and its general look and feel. Also, its character development is almost non existent except for Loki. As it opens up the Marvel cinematic universe into the far reaches of space age science fiction, the whole thing feels very much like the "Star Wars" prequels. High speed chases in space ships accompany the ever present laser guns, cloaking technology and plasma turrets. That sequence where Thor and Loki escape a blockaded Asgard with Jane just reeks of a similar scene in STAR WARS EPISODE 1.Then there are the romance and comedy. For most of the movie you have Thor and Jane pinning for each other like teenage love birds. Once together, they clearly look like they should be in love yet there is feeling of "fakeness" to their romance. Thankfully such scenes are few, with the focus on bigger action. In this department, the movie does not disappoint. The action is clearly of an epic scale and the stakes are high. Yet the movie sees fit to throw in as much inappropriate humor as possible into such heavy scenes. The humor just does not fit and in fact pulls us out of the moments. Moments where reality itself is crumbling and a character cracks a joke just feels like Disney at work again, killing another chance to take comic book superheroes seriously.Alas THOR: THE DARK WORLD is not a bad movie, it is good. It is just not as good as the first THOR movie, and this is likely due to executive meddling trying to get all new Marvel movies to follow the tone of Avengers. In trying to squeeze different types of stories into a single mold (no doubt to further cement their shared universe concept), you kill what made the concept great to begin with. Gone is Patrick Doyle's unique and spirit lifting symphony replaced by Brian Tyler's disappointing rehash of his CHILDREN OF DUNE soundtrack spliced with LORD OF THE RINGS and (believe it or not) Marvel's AVENGERS.In a similar vein, gone is what made THOR unique to begin with. It may not be a typical mindless blockbuster, but it is becoming a typical Marvel movie. Like Iron Man 3, like Avengers, and quite possible like all subsequent marvel movies; chock full of comedy, big action and cartoon style dialogue with no effort to try and take superheroes seriously or to craft a deep themed tale of costumed vigilantes gifted with awesome powers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Thor - the dark world - We all have loved the movie - Avenger,,,,and m sure all Hollywood movie lovers are waiting for its sequel which will come in 2014....But before that we have go Thor 2 this Nov and we will also get captain America 2 this winter.... Personally in comparison of my favorite hero in the avenger team Thor comes at last,,,,my favorite is cap America then iron man then hulk and then Thor,,,,and i haven't liked the first part of Thor much,,,,yes it was not bad but was not very good also .... But its sequel is really interesting,,,,.... The story starts in the same manner in which iron man 3 has started,,,,after the event of the avenger in new York....Thor is back to Asgard with Loki,,,,of coarse Loki was kept in prison....In the same time in some other part of the world,,,,the king of darkness was planning something bad.... The plot of the movie was not much interesting as compared to captain America or the avenger with some physics here and there etc.....But was good enough to hold u to your seats,,,,Whats actually rise your interest while watching the movie is the screenplay,,,,how a not so interesting plot was shown in an interesting form,,,,that's the strength of marvel comics,,,,they don't give enough strength on the plot as DC comics does,,,,instead of that they make there screenplay interesting,,,,and Thor 2 has a lot of humour jokes which will make u laugh rolling down your seat in the whole movie.... No doubt the action sequence are good too,,,,i haven't seen the movie in 3d but it was good in 2d too.... The best thing in the movie was the character of Loki(remember the villain from the avenger)....This time he was in the right side helping Thor but for his own profit,,,,and i guarantee u this man has a high sense of humour and is the most charming and 2nd most interesting villain (after joker from dark knight) in all time Hollywood movie....The chemistry between Thor and Loki is too good.... Natalia Portman is an Oscar winner actress,,,,she can do a superhero's love lady role with closed eyes,,,,so she was good enough too.... Yes Thor is not up to the mark like the avenger but it will have enough interesting stuff to make u engage till cap America 2 and the avenger 2 will come.... I will go for 3.5 out of 5 ,,,,....

		<shortDescription>Superhero movie in which universe is saved by wacky humans</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I truly enjoyed this film. The special effects are astonishing, as one expects in movies like this nowadays.But in the end it's just another typical latter-day sensational superhero movie. The elaborate alternative universe (i.e. the dark elves arising once again to use the evil gassy thing to destroy Asgard and the nine worlds) was a little too much for me. I enjoy a good movie, but I've reached the point where I am not that interested in being presented with new universes, in this case "the Thor universe". I didn't really care what happened to Asgard.I understand this is an action film oriented towards the video-game generation, and many movie goers want to see action on a grand scale. Moviegoers apparently want demon warriors, medieval empires and frightening alien technology in their movies. Well, I'm getting tired of it.I thought something went wrong with the portrayal of the group of Earth characters on which this franchise is focused. We didn't get to know them well enough. They were portrayed as corollary and wacky and frantic -- and yet they were able to develop this strange and powerful device out of nowhere. They were not true scientists. They were...what exactly? I don't get Jane Weston. Something is wrong with that character and her role in this movie, and perhaps also the way she is portrayed.There was too much action, and not enough plot and character development. There were too many coincidences, too many forced and contrived situations. (The stupid intern throws the car keys into the hole! Jane gets transported right to a small cavern deep underground, which just happens to be the worst place possible! Thor figures out in seconds how to fly an alien aircraft like a pro!) There were too many bone crushing fights and city destroying disasters.I went to this movie (and its predecessor) because...well...I think Chris Hemsworth is eye candy. He duly delivers. This is the perfect role for him. However, I'm ready to see him in a proper movie where he's given a chance to flesh out a character.There are some nice moments in the movie. I can't say I didn't enjoy it. It's better than the Batman movies. It's worth about 7.5 I'd say, but I'm going to round it down for now. I go to these movies, but maybe I shouldn't.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Solid, Mostly Well-made Entertainment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As I am a casual fan of Marvel films and I liked the generic but fun first Thor film, my expectations for Thor: The Dark World were positive. I was also excited because this is my first time reviewing a current film. I came away satisfied, but not without complaints. The premise is complicated, so I'll keep it simple. Thor (Chris Hemsworth) has to stop the Dark Elf Malekith (Christopher Eccleston) from covering the universe in darkness. Eventually, Thor decides to get his treacherous brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston) to help him navigate his way to Malekith's land, while not being able to trust him. The first half of the movie is rather boring. Nothing really interesting happens. But starting with Thor freeing Loki from prison, it becomes a good and exciting superhero film. All the characters are true to their personalities from previous films. All the heroes are funny and likable. Thor is what a superhero should be- a kind, justice figure that people should look up to. Tom Hiddleston gives his best performance so far as Loki. He's given a very interesting situation to work it, and it's obvious he's having a lot of fun. The same can be said for everyone else, too. They're all having fun. Visually, the movie is very impressive. While some CGI is only about as convincing as the Star Wars prequels visuals, most of it is very nice to look at. The action sequences are very creative and exciting. The mythical realm of Asgard looks more believable in this movie, and not as obviously computer-generated. The plot is hard to follow at times, but the movie keeps you drawn in enough to put aside your questions. But the biggest downside for me is Malekith. Now, I am not against serious villains in superhero movies. I loved Heath Ledger's Joker in The Dark Knight for his extreme complexity and scary nature. But Malekith is such a bland villain. We spend no time getting to know him. I have only seen one episode of Doctor Who as I write this, but from that episode, I feel that Christopher Eccleston is a good actor. He gives a decent performance as Malekith, but he really overpowers the character. Villain and some plot elements aside, Thor: The Dark World, while not being one of Marvel's best like Iron Man or The Avengers succeeds in being a fun, worthy outing of a franchise we love.

		<shortDescription>Better than the first, but not flawless</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, the sequel is finally out! How does it fare? The action is amazing, the acting has drastically improved, and the villain is more intimidating and threatening than the last. Pretty much everything is improved upon in every way, but it still manages to trip in a couple of areas which ultimately took down the film's greatness a notch or two.The premise revolves around Dark Elves who want the universe to bathed in darkness again (like it used to be) and they have a weapon that can do it. However, thousands of years ago the Dark Elves were virtually wiped out in a giant battle. Surprise, they are back and ready to try and make the world dark again... which honestly doesn't sound too bad but apparently it also destroys everything in the process... I guess... it isn't really explained.As I have already mentioned, the Dark Elves are really sweet. Their technology is unique and menacing and the 'Kursed' infantry are totally BA! The designs of the Kursed were unique because CGI was mixed with legitimate animatronics and intricate costumes. Very nice to look at. The Asgardian tech is also expanded upon further in this movie, which at times makes the movie feel like Star Wars (but oh well). The movie's first three-fourths or so has really good action that is well thought out. The battles have scale, clever elements, and lots of violence. If there is one complaint that I would have is that both sides seem to enjoy killing people in gruesome ways a little too much. I know we are all used to violence, but at times it is hard to sympathize with the main characters when they are brutally murdering their enemies. Which leads to one of the movie's problems:I wish the villains would win.To me, everything about the Asgardian culture seems wrong. When Loki murders and kills hundreds if not thousands of humans they slap him on the wrist. When Thor killed thousands of ice dudes in the first movie they only slapped his wrist. Even Odin is portrayed as an arrogant jerk in this movie who literally says "I am right because I win!" These guys need to be defeated! I want them to lose! Thor does have a bit of a change of heart in this movie, but still, Asgard is corrupt and obnoxious.The human aspect of the movie is still dull, but not as bad as in the first movie. The action there obviously had some influence from the game Portal. A new character named Richard is randomly brought up and forgotten. For being a new love interest, it is strange that he is entirely forgotten in the movie's finale and ending. Which brings us to the movie's weaker element: the finale. Don't get me wrong, the finale has a wonderful set up and some great moments; however, very little is explained for why things are happening the way they do. Out of nowhere, it is revealed that *spoilers* these medal instruments used for identifying issues in time and space can be used as weapons... why? It was never really explained what they do or why they do anything so it is incredibly random and unfair when they are used. Other questions such as what happened to the ice beast that got brought in through the portal aren't explained. Why did the Dark Elf ship EXPLODE FOR NO FREAKING REASON!!! I'm not even joking! The Dark Elf ship just decided to blow up with no explanation! The movie established previously that it was full of what looked like possibly hundreds of Dark Elves. In the final battle we see maybe 50 (and they came down in a pod, not the main ship itself) so what happened to the rest of them in the ship? The ship just tips over and explodes even though it was clearly shown in the previous scenes that it had its engines on so it shouldn't tip over.The finale does have its moments with humour and good action, but so little is explained and so many random events happen that are never explained even after the finale has finished! It is chaotic and random! However, the portal element was well-done.All in all, Thor 2 has a much better premise and set-up than a lot of Marvel movies of late. It has the action, the villain, the acting, the emotion, and the visuals; however, the conclusion didn't seem fair. If a villain is to lose, then he better lose fairly. You can't "cheat" the audience into a victory, because then it just feels like a joke. The bad guy was obviously winning and was superior, but for no logical reason he just loses. Another minor gripe is that the Dark Elves probably could've just worn dark sunglasses or have found some sort of agreement of having their own dark sector. Their plan didn't seem logical, and sometimes their strength varied depending on what was needed for the plot. Their ships are like flying swords that can cut through buildings, but in another scene they tear apart like paper just with a sword. This is another case of the movie "cheating".I would give it a 7 or a 7.5. Can't wait for the sequel! Oh, and what about Light Elves? Those are in mythology as well :P</fullReview>

That's what happens when you make everybody super-strong instantly, which Marvel is infamous for. I do enjoy the suburb acting by Tom Hiddleston, and watching Loki con everybody to his will is very fun. Plot was interesting, but they didn't play enough on the power of the the being. I also didn't like the fact the Earth depended on a psycho scientist, a smart scientist, and two dim interns.

		<fullReview>Marvel, best known for revolutionizing the comic industry in the 1960-70s, has recently taken their infamous monthly deadline work-ethic and adapted it to the motion pictures industry. And, while this tactic may be a guarantee for a monthly onslaught of paper-backed mayhem, the same cannot necessarily be said in regards to consistency of quality.The most recent example: Thor: The Dark World. Why the sophomore attempt at the Thor franchise may have slightly outperformed its predecessor in regards to direction, story concept and art design; it, ultimately, still found itself over-welding its weighty Hollywood Hammer, resulting in an utter demolition of continuity, writing and optic nerves.Once you get beyond the pseudo-(meta)-psychics and babbling tech-talk, the background story is left suffering from a big floppy case of motivational dysfunction; as you find the characters haphazardly wandering though scene after scene, perhaps searching for a certified script doctor.And, while the story lent itself to several subtle moments of potential acting gems, most notably from Tom Hiddleston, they were soon obliterated under the mystically omnipotent sledgehammer of Hollywood Blockbuster.Sure, we could chalk up Thor: The Dark World as just another comic book inspired popcorn-fest? if Christopher Nolan hadn't already proved that you can masterfully take the absurd and polish it into a piece of cinematic art.So, while this most recent high-def installment to the Marvel universe may satisfy your immediate super-hero craving, expect its fatty leftovers to spend their golden age in the back issues. 5.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>All Loki, no Thor.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I would give this 5.5. In fact, I am surprised by this high rating in IMDb, which I have been (and am) often using as a reference before watching any movie. Here, I come here to review this with no perfect English and shallow knowledge on movies. What I want to say is that this isn't worth watching. I watched this merely as a fan of the "Thor(2011)" (Seriously, Thor: The Dark World a 7.7 rating???). In comparison to the previous one which nicely introduced the character of Thor and the charming villain Loki, I don't see anything in here. There are only fighting, nice graphics, with no real substance (I truly agree to Viktor Cicvara's review) to draw the audience into the story line. Such one-dimensional characters and full-of-coincidence story. Only made me a fan of Loki, who wasn't the main character of the plot. Nice CG work, but worth no watch. -------Complete Spoiler only for those who are not willing to watch this film, yet curious or who doesn't care about spoilers---Suddenly, Jane gets dragged in (really out of nowhere) and soaks in a tremendous power that will destroy the world. Thor takes her to Asgard. The dark elves awakes after a millennium of time (maybe because the power have come out into the world as they waited. For a millennium!!!). Attacks Asgard and gets rid of its defense system so easily as if they could always have done it (with a little guidance of Loki). Kills the queen and run away because of Thor (so powerful to scare them off and hurt them). With the defense down, Asgard in danger. The King says that Asgard will fight back, Thor accuses him for being cruel...? As they cannot win the enemy, Thor decides to give them "power" and easily kill them (What a plan to save Asgard). Just as expected, the power is given and the whole nine realms in danger. What is surprising is that the once-mighty Thor cannot suddenly beat a single subordinate who he have already scared off. Loki gets killed saving Thor. Thor angry. Thor go earth. Jane know where the nine realms collide, which should happen every 5,000 years and happen to be soon. Thor fight the dark elf very well, win. (Goes in and out of universes so many time.) Thor return. The King of Asgard complements him, saying he's the true king (What a nice plan he has completed.). Thor rejects to be in a dehumanizing position. Turns out that Loki wasn't dead and acts to be the King via illusion. Loki prevails.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I was fascinated from this movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was hoping this movie to have another part because I was really fascinated by the first and second one so I am glad to see it coming.I really liked the moment when Thor became better person and demigod in the first movie and also the turnabout in the second movie when the two brothers Thor and Lookie united each others powers to fight against the evil forces and the fact that Thor and Jane Foster met each other. And also the fact that she made her dream come true seeing the bridge. The end of the movie makes me think that there will be third part and I hope so.I expect not be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My opinions and review on the movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I Loved this movie :) i personally recommend this to all my friend... Its based on Norse Mythology which is a subject im really into reading a a lot about but anyway the opening scene is really good then it picks up where the first movie ended.Battles scenes are decent.I couldn't help but notice how much this movie wore its influences on its sleeve. The movie version of Malekith is a Star Trek villain, through and through. He's mostly Romulan (I mean, look at him) with a little bit of Klingon thrown in. All his scenes feel like they're from a Star Trek movie (and not a great one), even down to the lighting. Some Asgard scenes feel pretty Star Trek-like, too. Any of the scenes that involve air battles feel a whole lot like Star Wars. There's an obvious Lord of the Rings influence, and I don't just mean in terms of the way characters talk or have beards. The way director Alan Taylor actually shoots close-ups looks very similar. And let's be real here: One big piece of the plot is Crocodile Dundee 2, with Asgard in the place of Australia (OK, I'm half-kidding on that one).Even Asgard seems less godly and more outright alien in this movie. Their medical facility (sick bay?) has non-magical apparati. Jane Foster even knows what they're using to examine her. It sparkles less. Odin's throne room isn't shot with the sort of impossible brightness it had in the first movie. It's dimmer. Anthony Hopkins plays Odin with less godlike certainty, even. There's a shot where he's considerably shorter than Thor, and he sort of just looks like a guy with a beard. He says outright the Asgardians aren't gods and can die.And that's what ultimately makes Thor: The Dark World a winner, in spite of its problems. It may occasionally lose some connection with the audience, but it always endeavors to re-establish it, either with a nicely timed joke or a gripping action turn. Also: It ends on a comic-book cliffhanger. That's pretty rad.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good for action, but lacking the emotional depth of the first film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Thor: The Dark World has a lot going for it: charismatic leads, strong supporting characters, lots of great action sequences, and a straightforward story. It's entertaining and is a decent, solid entry in Marvel's cinematic universe.But it could have been so much more. I see in this movie yet more evidence of a troubling habit in Hollywood action films: cutting vital character moments for the sake of inserting more action.The emotional underpinning of the first Thor film was the title character's growing maturity and redemption. In its follow-up, the heart of the film should have been Thor and Jane's growing romance. In particular, we had the opportunity for a compelling love triangle (Thor-Jane-Sif) that would underscore the differences between Asgard and Earth, between making the safe, obvious choice (Sif, the practically-immortal warrior maiden) and the hard, risky one (Jane, the vulnerable, short-lived human). But aside from a few seemingly throwaway lines that hinted at what could have been a much better story, we get none of this. This is a problem, because what is it that's driving Thor in this movie? It's his quest to save the woman he loves, even if it means betraying the realm where he grew up and is destined to rule. At least it's supposed to be, but we never get more than token acknowledgement of Thor's inner struggle--unlike the first film.Instead, what we do get is a pretty standard action movie: seemingly unstoppable bad guys; the stalwart good guy and his spunky love interest; their quirky helpers; clever one-liners; and, of course, action, action, special effects, action. It all holds together well enough, but the first Thor movie had so much more of an emotional foundation. This one feels rushed, as though several important (quiet, emotional) scenes are missing. Apparently some of those will show up on the DVD; I certainly hope so.Marvel should learn not to be afraid of making its movies a little longer. Thor, with his basis in mythology, deserves a big, epic canvas, and if it takes an extra 10-20 minutes or more of screen time to fit in the whole story, then so be it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As boring as the first.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Didn't really want to go watch this because I didn't like the first installment and I should have stuck to my gut. This movie was boring and drawn out. It was a 3 at best but I gave it 1 more star for the awesome costumes. The Jane Foster character is boring and bland and her assistant is meant to be witty and a little wild but comes off superficial and vapid. She's not funny at all and does not balance Foster's character.Thor is great eye candy and so is Loki but that is about all Asgard has to offer. Thor going between Asgard and Earth did not add anything to the movie. The worst part of the movie was the fight sequence in the end. Thor and the villain tangled in a fight jumping from realm to realm for what seemed like 5 minutes was a total waste and didn't make any sense.I almost feel bad for Hemsworth and Portman being stuck in this awful project. I don't know why Portman would sign up for such an insipid project. All senseless action, barely a plot then a juvenile twist in the end in a feeble attempt to make people aware there will be another segment. This time I'll follow my gut and stay away.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>fun, but don't expect the Aesir of mythology</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I like this movie. I recommend it, for movie fans, for action fans, for Marvel fans, for f/x fans, and even for my fellow heathens -- but for us, I must add the caveat that there are scenes that one might find shocking if one goes into this thinking one is actually watching a story about our gods. Think of the Marvel Thor movies as an alternate universe. I'm not going to list the scenes because I don't want to get too spoiler-y, but...Spoiler alert! Don't read any further if you don't want to read spoilers! Let's just say that at least scene one involves character death. You might not want to take young heathen children who might be confused about the difference between the Marvel Asgardians and the Aesir. It could be upsetting for little Asatru kids to watch a god they honor get killed.There is a lot of "fantasy violence" in this movie, so it's probably not one that kids that small would get taken to see anyway, but I thought it was important to warn heathen parents about that.That aside, this is a really enjoyable movie. The effects were seamless. The plot twists never stopped, right up until the end (which left me scratching my head and wondering if I missed a clue somewhere. I really didn't see it coming.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Improving the characters, not putting that much effort on the plot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It becomes a regular issue with recent films, especially when we're speaking about films that highly depend on CG and super fast action scenes. It's not a necessity but it's been proved repeatedly that building proper characters is getting a lot more attention than constructing real good plot. I can understand the reasoning behind it, when the characters are appealing, the actors find it easier to relate and do their work better. And almost everybody here excels though Tom Hiddleton as Loki deserves special notice. But the story could definitely be built better. And I'm not speaking about the plausibility of the basic premise, as I said more than once the entire idea of a living super hero calls for some suspension of judgment, but if this super hero operates inside our own world, some other laws of logic must apply, and many of those are ignored here. Which I find to be regrettable since everything else is of a very high quality. And yes once again - no real need for 3D, in fact even less so than in the original Thor movie. Bottom line - good fun that could've been much better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's a $170 million-dollar B-picture, and that's not necessarily a bad thing.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you peel back the expensive production values and the fancy schmancy special effects, "Thor: The Dark World," the latest superhero blockbuster from Marvel Studios, reveals itself to be a $170 million-dollar B-picture. That's not necessarily a bad thing. Actually, it's reminiscent of those cheap sword and sandal pictures from the 1960s with titles like "Hercules Unchained" and "Colossus and the Headhunters." All that's missing is Sandahl Bergman in a brass brassiere being chased around by a hoard of axe-wielding cavemen. Adding in those elements, Steve Reeves might have wept.All of the Herculean clichés are on display here, up to and including a scene in which our beefcake hero bathes himself over a wash basin ? a little treat for the ladies. "Thor: The Dark World" mostly takes place in Asgard, the kingdom run by Thor's father Odin (Anthony Hopkins), which is apparently one kingdom out of nine. Some of the others are seen very briefly and are more or less interchangeable. The technology of Asgard is kind of curious. You can travel between dimensions but the warriors still engage in hand-to-hand combat with axes and broad swords.The population of Asgard and the other eight kingdoms seems to be made up almost exclusively of male warriors. If the math is right, there are exactly three women in Asgard, one of which is a visiting human from Earth. The others are Thor's mom Frigga (Rene Russo) and Sif (Jaimie Alexander) a female warrior who is on hand to be . . . well . . . a female warrior.The movie is fun in a goofy, dumbbell sort of way. The production values are impressive, the plot is completely canned, yet this is not a boring movie. Unlike its predecessor, Kenneth Branaugh's dusty "Thor," this sequel benefits from a healthy and much-needed dose of humor. The laughs juice things up when the plot gets dry ? and that's most of the time. It's impossible to get involved in this story so you just keep waiting for the funny bits. A good deal of the humor comes from Chris Hemsworth who, in his third go-around as Thor, has relaxed into the role. Like Christopher Reeve in "Superman," he plays the role serious, but there's still a wink in his performance.The story? Who cares? It's so thin that you could spell it out on the back of a business card: Asgard, after generations of peace, finds itself threatened by an endangered species of dark elves who wish to harness the power of a substance called Aether (pronounced Ether) which will plunge the Nine Kingdoms into darkness. The elves are led by a malevolent dullard named Malekith (Christopher Eccleston) who speaks in pat, formal phrases that only serve to further the plot ("Your bravery will not ease your pain. Your family, your world will be extinguished!") He has a heavy-sloped evil forehead that makes him look like something left over from "The Lord of the Rings." In a plot element that will not be revealed here, Thor's earthbound scientist girlfriend Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) gets pulled into the Asgard war because she's in possession of something that Malekith wants. Portman's performance here is, more or less, just functional. She has more to do than she did in the first movie, but she really just plays a victim who exudes no independent personality. Much more entertaining is Foster's intern friend Darcy (Kat Dennings from CBS's "2 Broke Girls") who comes on as the comic relief and steals the show. She has such a wonderful personality, such a vibrant comic energy that her delivery reminds you a little of Phyllis Diller. Dennings is so funny and so energetic that you wish that she had been the romantic lead, or maybe even the villain. Maybe next time."Thor: The Dark World" was directed by Alan Taylor, a television director whose only notable film credit was a low-budget 1995 comedy named "Palookaville" about a group of bumbling crooks who get the idea to puncture the gas tank of an armored car so they can rob it when the tank runs dry, only to have the truck roll to a stop in front of the police station. That humorous touch is here too and he isn't afraid to use his special effects for a good sight gag. It leavens a movie that is, too often, over-stuffed with wall to wall special effects. Is "Thor: The Dark World" entertaining? Yes. Of the three Marvel pictures released in 2013, after the weary "Iron Man Three" and the boring drag of "The Wolverine," this one is the best. It's far from perfect, but it gets the job done.*** (of four)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hiddleston steals the entire show</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the original run of Marvel movies i think the one that i expected the least from was the first THOR. I was surprised when that one actually came out as the BEST of the Marvel flicks leading up to AVENGERS. Heading into "THOR: THE DARK WORLD" my expectations were significantly higher (though after Iron Man 3, maybe I should have tapered them), and thus i came out of this one slightly disappointed. Hemsworth's Thor really doesn't have much character development in this one. He was much more enjoyable as the spoiled-boy prince who earns the right to wield Mjolnir. Here he's kinda wooden as the wounded-puppy longing for Jane Foster. And when you see what Foster has been up to you really wonder what the guy could ever see in her. Honestly, the human characters in Thor 2 are the weakest link. Too much bad writing and too many cheap jokes that fall flat. Kat Dennings brings her "2 Broke Girls" shtick to the movie and it bombs badly. Portman's Foster is a pretty unlikable witch of a character. And what have they done to Stellan Skarsgard?Chris O'Dowd appears to be written as a poor sap of a nice guy who is being passed over for He-of-the-golden-locks, but he actually comes out as someone you root for and want to tell "Hey, buddy, it's okay. You're better then her anyways!"That's the real problem with the movie, the only person you really root for is Loki!!And how easy that is, as Hiddleston just chews this movie up and eats it for breakfast. Anytime he is on screen, the enjoyment factor goes up.The bad guys have a real cool look to them, but they aren't really developed to any point where they felt like a threat. And while interesting in concept, the final fight is head-scratchingly yawn inducing.It was nice to see Rene Russo actually have something to do here, and Hopkins was once again solid as Odin. And thank goodness for that saw-it-coming-but-still-lovely-to-see twist ending.I liked it. It was okay. But it wasn't as good as the first Thor.High hopes for CAPTAIN America:WINTER SOLDIER.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Seems that Loki is so popular these days that each girl will be screaming about him when watching the movie,which makes Natalie Portman invisible and unimportant. The lines in it are very funny with great humor,visual effect is also fantastic. However,it remains a big problem that the descriptions of each role are not convincing enough for us to understand what they are thinking about or planning to do.Supporting roles show us great performances which are way better than Thor and Jane,especially for Darcy and Erik. Anyway,some incredible surprises still turn up now and then.And it is way better than the first one.You shouldn't miss those excellent moments.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Teleported to the realm without fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first Thor is the only one of Marvel's recent crop I take to. It got Loki wrong to satisfy the demands of a generic plot with evil squarely on one side. But up above it had a gilded astral world, and down below Branaugh had all sorts of fun at the expense of his Shakespearean setup.Why did they have to mess a good thing? They made a good early decision for starters. The whole cinematic world would be defined by (hypothetical) quantum physics that allowed all sorts of spontaneous fun with appearances and transportation, an illusory fabric that changes at whims. They could now graft on it the right Loki from the fables, which are from a pre-Christian time when evil was not yet neurosis and sin, where Loki embodied capricious nature, illusion, uncertainty, spontaneity, a deeper understanding than a simple duality.So this could be fun, inventive and revealing in the same swoop.It's easy to see where this went wrong, they wanted a serious dark saga. A serious saga demands no surprise really, allows no playing. Thor goes from goodhearted jock to Superman brooding about Lois and his duty as protector of worlds as he flies around fighting gods, the worst possible decision.Why do we need these to be serious anyway? The forces are no more comprehensible in this way, the heroes no more human, just archetypes of some inner conflict. It should be as baffling to encounter these worlds, a civilization which has mastered the quantum field but still fights with swords, as capricious to decide on their mechanics as the actual physics at play.Strangely, they got a better Loki. Their whole trip together with Thor to the elven realm has a bit of that scent of the sagas. This is not a matter of sticking to origin, but seeing the value. We have some of that playing and illusion around Loki, that is until the end when they unmask him again as malicious tyrant.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*contains spoilers* Comics movie adaptations should be viewed as marketing exercises aiming to expand the reader base of the particular brand, and to sell even more books and merchandise to them. As a result, these movies, in an attempt to win over more fans, always pretend to be more than what they truly are: power-fantasies, tales written for teenage boys. Even though Marvel's target audience has shifted in age, the original characters created by Stan Lee back in the sixties were intended for this group. Now I don't mind a teen fantasy being transformed into a film, if it was marketed as such, like in the case of Narnia. It's a straightforward deal: you got what you ordered, French fries. But when it is puffed up with all the 'proper ingredients', it becomes a farce: techno babble and spaceships for science-fiction, over-the-top-acting and instantly predictable plot lines for family drama, bad guys chasing good guys in a dog fight for action, and even more miserable breaking-the-fourth-wall puns for comical relief than in the first part. I bet that no one from the management knew what this film was really supposed to be. Consequently, the actors stumble across the scenes as if they didn't know what the heck is going on either. At some point, you will ask the burning question: why would I care for the protagonists in the first place? A third-grade character from Family Guy is more engaging and has better lines than any one of the staff of Thor 2. Nothing in this movie makes too much sense. All we see is a race of Übermensch people living in glittering CGI pipe organs with all the wealth and knowledge to rule several realms, yet dumb enough not to prepare for a sneak attack on their capital. And don't even get me started with the Convergence and the Nine Realms... Truth be told, Portman was a refreshing experience, but after a while, even she was all over the place with her multiple roles of the affectionate Senator Padmé in love with the young, ambitious male leader-to-be, her being a super-smart astrophysicist and her being pretty much the plot device embodied. I wasn't a fan of the first part, but it had least some memorable scenes, and the out-of-world super-hero-in-trouble in New Mexico thing going on. This movie is the prime example that you cannot make up for an uninspiring story and sloppy writing, not even with cobbling together CGI, Hollywood headline acts and a whole bunch of high-tech Uruk-hai Orcs.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>THOR: The Dark World is definitely out of this world!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So this movie just blew me away. I did not expect it to be so funny. I thought that MARVEL got away with so much hilarity. But hey, the people loved it and so did I. What I loved about this movie was that you actually got to see more of Asgard and the way it was built and the details of it. The graphics were stunning and the storyline was a hit. So The Dark World is about a dark elf leader named Melakith and he strives to own this dark power to rule the planets as you would say. THOR struggles to maintain peace in the 9 realms of space and he must defeat Melakith while using his brother for help. Loki in this move was so deceiving. In the first THOR movie, we all know he was a bad guy. Then the Dark World he looks to be a brother sometimes and other times a fool and a double-crosser. I think in the movie (I didn't see it very well cause I was eating popcorn) Loki actually cuts off THOR's hand and it grows back. That part there made me feel that Loki wasn't really on THOR's side at all. But then you see Loki take his life for THOR and he actually dies. Natalie Portman had way better lines and acting in this movie. She wasn't nervous or acting all girly. She was actually slapping Loki because she was mad at him from The Avengers when he ruined New York. She actually got to see Asgard as THOR promised her from the first movie. She somehow manages to get the dark power that Melakith is looking for inside of herself and she reacts to it if people try to steal it, like Melakith.Overall, this movie was funny, hit the spot, was out of this world and they should totally make a 3rd movie!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as good as the first.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I liked the first one. I knew nothing about Thor as a superhero going into the movie. The first immersed me into a new world while doing a great job of bringing that world into our own. Everything looked great, it felt different, and reminded me of experiencing the Lord of the Rings in a smaller way.This one...not so much. Yes, it's a sequel and it's given that the audience should already be immersed into its own world, following the first. But...as it progressed, the jokes got more common, the clichés showed up, and I swear I would've made a good profit if I had $20 every time Loki used his trickster-hologram move. Now, I did enjoy most of the jokes, because they felt appropriate and in the right place at the right time. But when the world about to collapse, the fabric of reality about to break, people are dying, space-time is going out of whack...I find it very hard to take the conflict seriously. I'm not expecting Dark Knight or Man of Steel seriousness because that's just not how the movie presents itself. But as the plot unfolded, I just wasn't able to follow much of what was going on. Then, the villain himself...what a let down. I didn't expect much in the first place, but was hoping nothing like Iron Man 3. His grunt is apparently stronger than the hulk and his almighty, ever-destructing, reality-breaking weapon/power didn't seem so great once it met Thor and his hammer.I enjoyed the action, some jokes, and the special effects looked spectacular. I liked how it showed more of the less glorious side of Asgard and showed different realms. I also enjoyed being able to watch a Marvel hero on screen again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than the first Thor..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought that Thor was a decent movie, but possibly the weakest of the Avenger stand alone movies. I didn't think it was on par with The Hulk Remake, Iron Man, and even Captain America. I felt the Thor movie was a little weaker (Captain America is a close, but not too close, second place).That said, Thor: The Dark World gives Thor the type of movie that the first one should have been. The scale is larger, the effects are better, and I think the story was stronger. I enjoyed the humerus aspects of the film which were ramped up due the success of the Avengers. This formula works.Hemsworth does a good job with Thor. You can tell he's really embraced this role as it is his defining role to date. He obviously looks the part, and he does a good job giving Thor a personality. He's a little rigid, but I think that's the character he's playing. The intensity is there, but so is the comic relief when it needs to be.Tom Hiddleston really steals the show with Loki. His charisma shines through in his portrayal and you can really tell when a truly talented stage/film actor such as Hiddleston finds a role and a character that he truly loves. His portrayal is effortless and full of emotion, which in my opinion, makes Loki by far the most intriguing villain in the entire Marvel Universe.I could do without Natalie Portman's character. I understand it's necessary in order to humanize the film and link Thor to Earth, but I find it a little pointless that she has to be included as a piece of the puzzle surrounding the Dark Elf mytho. Having Asgaard and the Dark Elves battle on their own would have been just as effective and less annoying.The three Agaardians are utilized much less in this movie and were almost rendered to bit-parts. I thought this was too bad as I'm certain they have larger roles to fill in the comic book universe and would have been a better fit into the movies as compared to the group of annoying human characters.Odin (Anothony Hopkins) was a mystery to me. In the first movie he is seen as a confident, wise, powerful leader whom must be shown respect and yet in this movie he appears to be a cranky old man. I wasn't thrilled with the treatment Odin received.In the end this is a solid movie and I think much better than the original. There are some strange directions taken with the story, but in the end some fantastic effects, solid acting, funny jokes, and Loki redeem many of the flaws? Rating: 7.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Thor: the Dark World was action pack to the point that indeed it was the God of Thunder. My ears hurts after this movie. Louds of exploding sounds. Unlike the first movie, where Thor lost his power, Thor (Chris Hemsworth) in this film is more God-like, and mature. Thor isn't learning anything new as a human being, or being taught a lesson in this movie. It just Thor trying to stop an alien invasion, yet again like 2012's Avengers. Indeed, comic book fans would like to see Thor do more Thor things and they got it. In my opinion, I like character development, and this movie lacks that. The movie plot is bit too confusing and silly for me. The aliens trying to conquer the Universe with a weapon known as Aether seem one-dimension villains who just happen to be just evil. After all they are call Dark Elves. Malekith (Christopher Eccleston) played a competent bad guy and I was really disappointed by his performance. I really wanted him to stand out more. Even with me, reading some of the Thor comic books, knowing a few Norse mythology, and watching the previous films, I did find myself, coming in lost. I can only guess, what first time people were thinking coming into the film, they must be asking themselves, what in the hell are we watching? The movie does an OK job, telling the backstory of the plot, and then to repeat it time after time just to make sure, but even with that, as a first time Thor watcher, you might find yourself confused. Unlike the original film that takes place mostly on Earth, in this film, most of scenes take place in the CGI world-building nine realms worlds of Norse mythology. The worlds is a lot better, than the first movie as I thought Asgard look so fake in the CGI due to all the shine crap. Asgard is supposed to look old, grittier and dirty like Vikings. It been there for thousands of years. Glad to see the film, wasn't in Dutch angle that much this time. In this film, it remind me of bit of Lord of the Rings, as more details are added to the mixed. After all, there was even a language created for the Dark Elves. Still, the Shakespeare dialogue got to the point, I was not only getting lost, but tune out. Hard to relate to the main characters, when nothing about them, is even relates to the real world. I found myself, trying to escape this world, but the dialogue is so bland. Yes, the film did had lot of humor. Mostly the same fish-out-of-water jokes from the first film. It was a hit or miss. They even made Thor look more like a meatball than the previous films. They did give Loki (Tom Hiddleston) most of the best lines in the film. I have to say that when Thor has to team up with Loki against his newest threat, it was some of the best scenes in the film. They had this buddy cop thing going for them. I think Marvel really did hit the gold mine with the actor because he does bring some really need charm, and humor to a really out of place world. I think the ladies in the room even like his presence. Most of the humor, came in the form of a side-character that fans of the first movie kinda didn't like which is Darcy Lewis (Kat Denning). In this movie, she is given more annoying scenes, but at less she kinda has a reason to be in the film. I'm sorry, but I'm not a huge fan of the character as her scenes feel like filler scenes that has nothing to do with the main plot. The female leads seems really weak in this film. In my opinion, I thought Thor and Loki had more screen connection, than Foster and Thor. Natalie Portman as the love-interest to Thor, Jane Foster, seem really to be phoning in her performance, here. I really doubt, Portman really gave much of herself in acting for this role. She really seem like she didn't want to act in this picture. It was no surprised that on screen, her performance was mediocre. She nearly backed out, when Director Patty Jenkins was replace by director Alan Taylor. She refused to return for the sequel but she was forced to return due to her contract. I did like the surprise secrets cameos: look out for somebody a certain American to make his brief presence, creator Stan Lee and if you stay after the credits, a certain character from the 2014's Guardians of the Galaxy movie. There was some things, I didn't like. I didn't like the awful plot recycle similar to the Avengers film with Aether sounding like the same thing as the Tesseract AKA Cosmic Cube. Without spoiling too much, look out for a lot of recycle fake out deaths like the first movie, 'Thor'. So annoying as hell. I did like the action in the film. I like the portal action scene in the end. It was pretty interesting and funny seeing Thor's beloved supercharged hammer "Molinjor" trying to find him. Watch it in 2D, the 3D added little of worth. Overall: The movie is a little far fetch even for a comic book movie as Thor has always been a hard character to get people into liking him, but it works here to a point. At least, if they cut like 30 minutes of the film. This deeply cheesy cartoonish, extremely noisy action movie that's drowning in CGI was not the worst comic book film, in my opinion. It was a feel good fun fantasy escape movie. It work as a good filler film before the next Avengers film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thor Goes Star Trekking</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a big fan of Marvel movies and this was indeed a visual feast. However, it seemed like I was watching a Star Trek movie as the Dark Elves look like a Stark Trek character and they do come with space ships. The plot was to complicated (a bit like Stark Trek movies) for the ordinary person and failed to wrap the viewer in the movie like we were in the Avengers and Iron Man. It did entertained us Marvel fan but not my wife who was looking at the watch 30minutes into the movie (though she did like the avengers). I mean, Superman is a difficult character to bring down to earth and humanize but the last movie accomplished just that, shame they couldn't do the same for this sci-fi Thor movie. Looking forward to the more down to earth, Captain American Winter Soldier and X-Men.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just my thoughts. Beware, there are spoilers!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a spectacular film; one of the best one's that I've seen in awhile. I'm still thinking of this movie after seeing it on Saturday. And it's Monday now. I'm actually going to see it a second time tomorrow!I love how they made Loki really sassy, and how Darcy was becoming more in it. Thor was much, much more mature as well. It seems like all the characters had a time to shine.Though there was a lot of funny moments in this, it had a lot of heart breaking moments. Such as when Frigga died, and the whole funeral scene for her. And then there was the scene when Loki 'died'. During the scene where Loki 'died', I saw character development. At the end of the first Thor film, he states that he did all of his doings for his Father, Odin. But with the second Thor film, he says that he didn't do it for him. We also saw that Thor and Loki love each other, though they do not show it.Tom Hiddleston is a brilliant actor, he portrayed Loki's emotions very very well. Like at the time where Thor told him "No more illusions", when his mother died and he went to see him. Tom literally did a great job at that, from his eyes to even looking like he was shaking. All of the other actors did a great job, too. I also enjoyed how more of this movie took place in Asgard, instead of Earth. I feel as if that had a huge impact of the film. We also got to see other realms, which drew me in more.Not to mention, the end. There was a hang there, sort of seeking to a third Thor film. I think that the cliff hanger was a very good one, and I am definitely looking forward to what comes more of the Thor movies, and even Thor and Loki in other Marvel movies, such as the up coming Avengers movie - though I'm not quiet sure that Loki will be in that. I would recommend this movie to anyone. 10/10 Great film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes, Loki is fun to watch on screen. Yes, I like Kat Dennings character. Yes, there are some funny lines/scenes. Yes, the special effects are numerous and generally well-done. But too many negatives otherwise. No, I don't know anything about the villain. No, I don't understand the villain's motivation. No, I don't understand what they hope to achieve with the thing they are trying to acquire. No, I don't understand the 'weapon' and what it does (other than, 'bad stuff'). No, I don't really care about the good characters. No, the climactic battle didn't make much logical sense at all. I suppose if you've been collecting Thor comics forever, then all of it would make sense and you would already care about the characters. However, if you come into this without that background, be prepared for 2 hours of apathetic munching of popcorn, broken by an occasional smile. It's a summer movie, just a few months too late.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Simply amazing!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Thor: The Dark World is definitely one of the best superhero films I've ever seen. The cast, led by Chris Hemsworth and Natalie Portman, did a great job once again. Supporting actors Tom Hiddleston, Idris Elba, Kat Dennings, Jaimie Alexander, Anthony Hopkins, and so many more really are amazing. I've heard a lot of complaints about the pace being too quick and difficult to keep up with. My response? Don't take stupid people to see the movie. I honestly don't see how anyone would have trouble keeping up with the pace of the film. I thought the plot development was actually one of the stronger parts of the film. Another strong element was the humor. Like the first installment, there was a lot of situational humor. However, this movie took it to an entirely new level and didn't feel forced and out of place. Most of this is thanks to the aforementioned Kat Dennings and her unique comedic flair. Also, watch for the Captain America cameo for maybe the most humorous scene in the film. The action sequences were up to par with the rest of the movies, meaning they were epic. Natalie Portman is as breathtaking as ever and the rest of the supporting cast adds a combination of depth and humor. The only negative in the movie, and I'm really not sure if it's a fair one, is that I wanted more Lady Sif. I'm sorry but you have one of the most beautiful women in the world, who happens to be a fantastic actress, playing one of the most badass and intriguing roles in the movie and she's barely even relevant? You've gotta do better than that. Supposedly she originally had a more prominent role even creating somewhat of a love triangle but the studio ultimately decided to trim that back, essentially eliminating a large chunk of her screen time. After some thought I decided it didn't really "hurt" the film so I won't let it affect the rating but I would've liked liked to see her more. Hopefully we'll get that in the special features when it releases on blu-ray. Overall, I'd say this is probably the third best Avengers film yet, behind Iron Man and The Avengers. Hopefully they continue to deliver because they've got one helluva series going.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Thor : The dark world. Is better then the first one by a wide margin. It takes place shortly after the events in AVENGERS. Thor is going thru out the nine realms trying to restore order. wars have broken out as a result of Loki's interference. When Thor has brought peace to the nine realms. He is once again offered the throne of Asgard. But Thor misses Jane Foster. On Earth Jane discovers the long lost hidden doomsday forged by the dark elves. The Dark ones want to bring an end to light and restore the universe to darkness. Jane absorbs the weapon and it possesses her. The one thing making all of this possible is a alignment of the nine realms that occurs once every five thousand years. It happens briefly. but it lasts long enough to waken the Dark Elf overlord who plans to destroy Asgard. And then destroy light. Thor returns to Earth to discover JAne is now the living embodiment of the deadly weapon. He brings her to Asgard to try to find a cure for her. But the Dark Lord follows. Asgard is in danger and all of life hangs in the balance as Thor must find a way to defeat the monster. His only hope is a unholy partnership with Loki.Thor the dark world is simply a better movie then Iron man III. The action is impressive. The acting is very well done and the direction is sharp. Simply the best Marvel film since Avengers or Captain America.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Thor: The Dark World 9.5 out of 10.0Simply spectacular?To start, the Marvel superhero franchise is the one of the few second only to Pirates of the Caribbean, to figure out how to make a captivating film. By the end, they leave you with a feeling of breathlessness and exhilaration that is rare to find in movies these days. You feel as though you were with the characters on their journey, felt what they felt. They accomplish what any great film should?to make the audience feel as though they lived the movie for those two hours. Those kind of films excite and inspire me in a way that cannot be described, something rare that you cannot put a price on.Thor: The Dark World manages to do just this quite effortlessly (so to speak). The characters in my opinion are the backbone of the film, and they are beautifully written and portrayed. Particularly if you watch its predecessor beforehand, you can see the evolution and development of the characters. Thor has learned humility and sacrifice, and to deal with a pain brought on too soon. Loki is evolving as well, and it is exciting to watch Tom Hiddleston deliver a performance that opens your heart to what may arguably be the most well-written antihero of all time. Loki is so conflicted, torn between his heart and his drive for power, continually struggling to control the onslaught of emotions swirling around inside him. Always sly and manipulative, he finds an advantage and a witty retort for every tense situation. Even though he is devious and cannot be trusted, the pain and torment he endures pulls at your heart, and like Thor, you just can't help but hold onto a glimmer of hope that he is still in there and can be reached. This film offers both answers and questions to where Loki's true allegiance lies. Without revealing too much, it is absolutely marvelous seeing a little piece of the good inside bubble up to the surface. The direction was a nice change of pace with Alan Taylor taking over for Kenneth Branagh. Usually directorial changes are at the detriment of the sequel, but not so in this case. He gives the film a feeling of depth and a much broader scope than the first. It's visually stunning, and only wish we got to explore Asgard a little more. The CG is *far* improved in this one as well, lending itself to helping the audience submerse themselves.The transitions from action to drama to comedy were so quick and yet so seamless. It is a testament to the screen writing that we can feel engrossed the pain and loss in one scene and then laughing in the next.I also love that Anthony Hopkins as Odin and Rene Russo as Frigga got more screen time. I only lament that we did not get to see Thor, Loki, and Odin fighting side by side, but perhaps such novelty is reserved for the third installment.Furthermore, I also find fascinating that in theory, the anti-gravitational fields caused by the convergence offer an explanation to otherwise unexplainable things that happen in our own world, and as they state, may be another offering to the fact that in some cases science fiction turns out to be science that we had yet to understand. There is an intelligence and curiosity involved in this film that was grossly lacking in the first.The one complaint I would say I probably have is the lack of character development of Jane Foster. She seems to just be kind of there, with no particular conflict other than the Aether running through her veins. She does show strength, but for the most part is portrayed as nothing more than a woman pining after a man?well, Thor that is. I also thought there would be more of a complication regarding removing the Aether from her without killing her. Furthermore, Dr. Erik Servig's eccentricities I think were a bit over-exaggerated, but it brought humor nonetheless. One could also argue that more elaboration should have been offered regarding Malekith and the Dark Elves, but being as though there were so many shades of gray and eccentricities surrounding Loki that were far more fascinating, there is much less need for it.And I'm not sure if it was just me, but despite all the overall success of the execution of the film, I couldn't help but feel as though some scenes were cut out. It seemed as though we missed something in Asgard with Thor and Jane, and also the bifrost was destroyed and now suddenly it's just there with no explanation?There is a transformation starting to take place in this film as it evolved from the first, and I can't wait to see what direction they take in the next one. I'm not entirely sure how I'm going to last waiting two years to see what happens next?9.5 out of 10.0-HM</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I always go to every Marvel midnight premiere and I was really excited since Iron Man 3 was a bit disappointing. I was never a big fan of Thor when I saw the first movie but what really made me a fan was when i saw The Avengers. I was still a bit skeptical but after the first 30 min i was hooked. It was a rollarcoaster of action, drama, and a few laughs. It was so much fun watching this movie even though i just watched in 2D but i will definitely go see it again in Imax 3D. Loki is my favorite villain in the Marvel world I love him! Every scene with Loki was wonderful! Man hes a sick bastard but i love it. I know who I'm dressing up as next year at Comic Con ;) I strongly recommend seeing Thor the Dark World its great for the whole family and the crazy nerd like myself.

		<fullReview>When we left our friends in Asgard, all was right in the 9 realms after Loki was thrown into an abyss for his selfish ways and almost destroyed everything the Asgardians hold most dear. But it has been 2 years since Jane Foster and Thor parted ways and now they are reunited because of a darkness that shrouds over Jane's inner body as she infects a most powerful and deadly weapon that could not only destroy her but the entire 9 realms ? it takes a vicious monster Malekith (played wonderfully by Christopher Eccleston) to destroy all of the races in the universe to converge it all in darkness. But it takes Thor (Hemsworth) along with Foster (Portman) and Loki (Hiddleston) to save the day. But what we don't know may surprise us ? that the Tesseract, the Aether, so close together creates something more deadly than what they could ever even think that could happen to the fate of the entire universe. This movie was excellent and I am looking forward to seeing what is next for our mighty god of thunder.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>By this point, you're either a fan of what Marvel Studios are doing with their movies, or you aren't. It is that pure and simple, and if you enjoyed the first Thor film and his role in The Avengers, then you will absolutely love Thor: The Dark World, as I did.Few films these days are as much fun as the films that Marvel Studios are putting out right now. Not only are these films showing deep respect and faithfulness to their source material whenever they can, but they also never try to downplay the fantasticalness of what makes these comic book heroes so awe-inspiring. They embrace the comic booky-nature of all of these heroes and portray it not as satire, because while there are jokes at almost every juncture of these films, the characters are always taking the situations they are in seriously, therefore we're laughing while feeling like there are genuine stakes at hand. Thor: The Dark World does Marvel's typical bang-up job of this, and everything works.This particular film is very much born out of the repercussions of Thor and The Avengers, picking up right where those films left off, and you must have seen both of those films in order to get full enjoyment out of this one. At the start of Thor: The Dark World, Thor is still traveling across the nine realms, trying to restore peace and order to the galaxy after he had to destroy the bifrost at the end of Thor, therefore cutting off the other realms from Asgard's protection. Meanwhile, Loki has been imprisoned in the dungeons of Asgard for his attack on New York at the end of The Avengers. When the convergence of the nine realms approaches, that only happens every one thousand years, an ancient power awakens, threatening to destroy all nine realms, including Midgard, or Earth, as it is better known. This sends Thor having to journey back to Earth to save his beloved mortal, Jane Foster, while also having to make a shaky alliance with Loki in order to fight the evil that is brewing.As a whole, there isn't anything more I can say to entice you to see this film. If you love these films, you're going to see it. All I can really say is that Thor: The Dark World is everything you expect it to be. There is tons of action, lots of laughs (contributed mostly from Kat Dennings' Darcy and some smartly utilized cameos), and the film is also emotional and genuinely heroic. Few films can put you through so much emotional turmoil in the course of the story, and yet still keep things lighthearted and full of hope. That is what Marvel does better than anyone else. What we're seeing here is a new Golden Age for Marvel superheroes, and if you just sit back and allow yourself to enjoy the ride, rather than searching for ways to not like these films just because you have your own ideas of how you feel these heroes should be best represented on film, then you will be a part of something that is truly special.P.S. Stay till the very end of the credits. There are two scenes after the end of the movie. One in the middle of the credits, and one after they're all done.I give Thor: The Dark World a 9 out of 10!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Thor: The Dark World is a 2013 American superhero film featuring the Marvel Comics character - Thor who fights to restore order across the cosmos but an ancient race led by the vengeful Malekith returns to plunge the universe back into darkness. Faced with an enemy that even Odin and Asgard cannot withstand, Thor must embark on his most perilous and personal journey yet, one that will reunite him with Jane Foster and force him to sacrifice everything to save us all. It was really a great movie, thrilling, with humor, great visuals and highly recommended to watch not just by the marvel fans but definitely must watch by all. Chris Hemsworth as Thor was hotter, smarter and much powerful this time. I loved the brothers (Loki and Thor) fight side by side against the enemy, this was the best we've seen for Loki with his trickier acts. Marvel keeps delivering high level characters act which make us more excited on what to expect next.</fullReview>

Those that have seen the previous movies will be completely thrilled, and those who are just starting will appreciate the snappy, witty dialog and the action-packed scenes. The film is filled to the brim with adventure and the romance is just subtle enough to exist, but will not bore the younger ones. The French version of this film is terrific. Some jokes were better rephrased in French than in English, from what I've seen in the trailer. A couple scenes were almost word-less and still had me shaking in laughter. There are also heart-wrenching moments, and a predictable twist at the end (it couldn't have been a Marvel movie otherwise!) but the direction of the twist was unexpected. Stay after the credits for extra scenes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thor and Gotye team up to take down the Ninth Doctor...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Darcy! Jane! Selvig! Mjölnir! The gang's all back. For me, Thor was one of the best superhero movies to come out in recent time. I far preferred it to the overrated Iron Man films and wanted another. So here it is, and while it's not as good as the first one, it's still quite enjoyable. Chris Hemsworth, despite having the less flashy role next to Tom Hiddleston's Loki, is really very good. What made Thor so likable in the first film was that, despite his overconfidence and head-strong nature, he went on a character journey that changed him. He grew as a character and, thanks to Hemsworth's charm, you felt for him. He had lots of great little moments. Then he got royally screwed in The Avengers and was made a mockery of, which did a major disservice to him. This time around, he's back to strutting his stuff and doing what he does best: wielding his mighty hammer like no one else can. As for Hiddleston as Loki (who is now sporting long stringy dark hair that makes him look like a pale rocker from the 80's. Or, alternatively, the singer Gotye. Apparently they don't have hair gel in Asgard jail), while I wasn't blown away by him originally, I grew to like him in The Avengers and felt he was also made the butt of a joke in that film at the expense of his character. Now he's back once again, this time to make us wonder if he really *is* someone Thor can trust or is still as bad as ever. Evidently, his popularity is what keeps bringing him back. I can see why he has his fans, and Hiddleston is very good in the role, plus he has great banter with Thor. However, I personally feel it's about time we got a break from him. He shares some good scenes with Thor, Jane Foster gives him a much-deserved slap, and he even gets to have the odd hero moment (one of the best being when he saves Jane, then Thor saves him). We do see how much Thor truly cares for his brother, despite their differences. If only the films could let him go. You know it's all about Loki when the film basically begins/ends with him. It almost doesn't even feel like Thor's film anymore.I know Natalie Portman's Jane Foster has her haters, but she's actually right up there (along with Captain America's Peggy Carter) as one of my favourite love interests from any superhero film. Although she doesn't have super powers, she's clever and brave. I like that she's an astrophysicist and human. I thought both she and Hemsworth's Thor had nice chemistry in the first film, so I'm glad we got to see more of them together here. Yes, she's angry with him and slaps him - but it's understandable/warranted, given how he left her. To her credit, she doesn't stay mad for long once she learns what happened. With a magical force called the Aether inside of her this time, she proves pivotal to the storyline (gaining some striking blue eyes in the process. The effects used for the Aether are quite dazzling). The other humans are also good. Kat Dennings as Darcy still gets lots of funny moments (no one can say 'Mjölnir' as cutely as she does), while Erik Selvig often being naked or without pants shows the after effects of what was done to him in The Avengers. Fans of the Warriors Three &amp; Lady Sif may be disappointed. While they didn't have *that* much screen time last time, they still managed to make the most of it and I came to care about them as characters. This time, they may get a bit more screen time, but it's not nearly enough. The real shame is the lack of Jaimie Alexander as kick-arse Sif. Yes, she has her moments, but she could've done with a LOT more. At least she plays a part in the sequence partway through the end credits. Zachary Levi (from TV series Chuck) makes the most of his time replacing Josh Dallas as Fandral. Anthony Hopkins as Odin, I felt, was better and had more presence in the last film. In this one, his character acts like Thor did originally before he grew as a person. The role reversal may be intentional, but I don't think it served Odin's character well. As for Thor's mum...well...at least she proves that she can kick a bit of arse herself, but unfortunately for her...now she's just somebody that Loki used to know (blame Loki's hair for all the Gotye references). At least we see that he *does* care for her, try as he might to hide it.Whilst the Dark Elves are interesting to look at and have some pretty neat gizmos at their disposal, they aren't particularly memorable. Nor is their leader, Malekith (Christopher Eccleston). The best thing about him is his epic fight with Thor, which takes them back &amp; forth between worlds/different locations. The Frost Giants were better. The movie still has plenty of humour. Scenes such as Thor, Mjölnir &amp; a coat rack, Thor on a train, or the one where Loki shows off his powers and we get an unexpected appearance from that other likable Avenger (Captain America) are just a few of many funny moments throughout. I didn't think I'd miss Kenneth Branagh and his love of tilting the camera diagonally, but I feel he was able to craft a superior film to this one. I also missed the original film's score (which had so much emotion to it). On the plus side, we get some nice eye-catching end credits this time, which are done in a painting style. The mid-credits scene is the most bizarre yet out of all the Marvel films, though don't miss the after-credits scene. Here's an idea: Thor &amp; Captain America in their own buddy movie. Make it happen, Marvel!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was a big disappointment for me. If Loki had not been in it the movie would have been dull beyond belief. The main antagonist, played by Christopher Eccleston, was terrible; the most one-dimensional character I've seen in a long time. There's some spaceship battles straight out of the Star Wars prequels as well.Apart from some nice visuals and some decent fights, a couple of cool cameos and some funny moments, this one fell flat for me and poor in comparison to the first.It was only when the battle came to Earth that things got interesting, I think prior to that there may have been too many CGI backgrounds and special effect fights which made me switch off. I did start to get into it towards the end but it was not an enjoyable journey.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The God of Thunder Returns, with More Lightning</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Marvel's superheroes just keep coming. It's just only been a few months since the release of the immensely successful "Iron Man 3". Now it's Thor, the God of Thunder to strike back. Thor is of course the least relatable of the Avengers. But that doesn't stop this movie from succeeding. There are multiple references to what happened in the blockbuster "The Avengers". Often referred to as the "alien invasion in New York", it doesn't really play a major role in the primary plot in "Thor: The Dark World" itself. So, even if you haven't watched "The Avengers", don't worry, you won't feel left out.The plot of "Thor: The Dark World" concerns with something extremely ancient. The Aether is kind of like a fluid that is extremely full of energy and is able to turn ordinary matter into dark matter. This ancient relic begins to play its part in the story after scientist Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) travels to another world accidentally and encounters it. It is later revealed that every 5000 years, the nine realms will be in perfect alignment and therefore, borders between these worlds become blurred. This is an event known as the "Convergence". However, due to the recent activity of the Aether, a race called by the Dark Elves, led by Malekith, are awakened. Apparently, they were once ruthless rulers who were defeated by Odin's father Bor. Bor vanquished the Dark Elves and it started a peace that lasted for thousands of years. However, Malekith wants the Aether to plunge the whole universe into total darkness. He intends to that at the peak of the "Convergence". Now, it's up to Thor to stop Malekith and his evil schemes. If Thor is to defeat Malekith, he's going to need help from someone unlikely...... Loki.Yes! A team-up between Thor and Loki. This is one of the most exciting components of the film. Thor is serious, powerful whereas Loki is wise-cracking, mischievous, and very tricky. Together, they form a very well-balanced duo and seeing them work together is true joy. There is plenty of action. Of course! It's a superhero action movie. But the superpowers incorporated here are mighty and therefore the sequences are intensified. The Aether is slick and don't forget, Mjolnir is a ravager. The 3D is amazing and I watched this in IMAX 3D. Not all of the scenes were shot in IMAX, but some of the landscapes were incredibly beautiful. More of Asgard is revealed and it really is gorgeous. The movie also had a comedic nature. In fact, it was funnier than I expected. The mischievous and charismatic Loki is plenty of fun to watch. Watching him on screen is pure delight and his character is extremely interesting. But you also have to keep an eye on Dr. Erik Selvig, Jane's ally. He's gone a bit crazy in this movie and therefore, his antics are hilarious in the movie. Malekith is an all-powerful villain and he is intimidating. However, I didn't really think he was an interesting villain. His background is rich but that was short. We don't know really know Malekith. He is extremely devoid of character and sometimes, he's so boring. He, along with his race, speak a language that sounds like pre-historic dialect to me. Performances were wonderful. Chris Hemsworth is a well-rounded character and has given Thor adequate depth. Natalie Portman is stunning as the pretty and intelligent Jane Foster. Anthony Hopkins shows his class as Odin. Tom Hiddleston is flawless as Loki. His performance is top-notch. Christopher Eccleston's performance was polished enough, although his character was a bit boring. So is it a good movie? Yes. "Thor: The Dark World" is a good sequel and I would say that this exceeds the original in quality. I enjoyed the film although the villain was kind of dull. It may fall in some aspects but overall, this is a great success. And as a Marvel film, check out the two post-credits scenes. Rating: 8/10Final Verdict: "Thor: The Dark World" is a well-polished sequel that has great action, excellent chemistry (especially between Thor and Loki), but lacks character in the villain.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Far better than the first movie. Sorry, but I found the first movie is a bit boring... I do not read the comics so I will just write what I know from the movies version. This sequel of Thor (2011) is simply amazing and obviously becomes a movie that you want to watch over and over again like Marvel's The Avengers (2012).The main characters from the first movie come back. With a bit of change in the cast, I think (Zachary Levi!). Begins with a war in the "space" between Malekith and Asgard, Loki with handcuffs brought to prison, another battle in present time with the appearance of Asgardian warriors. Thor, of course, came up with a dramatic entrance. Kicking-ass as usual, then the story moved to a peaceful, everyday life in Earth/Midgard. Jane, Darcy (Kat Dennings is still awesome), and Ian (intern!) found a dimension portal as told by a group of kids, Jane disappeared into another world, the Aether made Jane its host, Jane came back to surface, and finally met Thor.Thor brought Jane to Asgard and tried to get out the Aether from Jane's body. But yeah, it is not that easy. Then Malekith invaded Asgard resulting Frigga's death. The scene when Frigga and fallen Asgardian warriors were burnt and brought to afterlife was really awesome and gave me chills. Thor, seeing this, would not just sit around while Malekith and his army brought grieves to Asgard. He asked for Loki's help to escape Asgard. Of course also with the help of Sif, Volstagg, and Fandral. Epic battle with Malekith ending with Loki's death (no, he is not). Thor then came to Earth with Jane and battled Malekith for the last time. With those portals being unstable, some of the teleport scenes are hilarious and awesome at the same time. Malekith was killed after being teleported to Svartalfheim, with Malekith's own ship crashed over him.And do not forget the post-credit scene. There are two of them. Seeing this post credit indicates the possibility for the third movie. Overall, this movie is awesome. Action, drama, comedy, science-fiction, mythology things, you can find all of them in this Thor: The Dark World. All of them are in right position and makes this movie amazing. But with all those amazing things about this movie, it also has a bit of minus side. I think Loki needs more screen time than that, no sign of S.H.I.E.L.D. at all??? (only mentioned once), and why should Frigga dead? Thor: The Dark World is highly recommended. Especially for the fans of Thor, Marvel movies, and action-genre. You will not be disappointed and I am sure you want to watch this over and over again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Addition To Phase 2!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*Acting*: Fantastic - Kat Dennings stood out to me; although she had a lot of screen time, more so than the Warriors 3 it appeared - but she portrayed the character so well that I really didn't care because frankly, she was very entertaining. Chris Hemsworth reached a new level of 'fantastic' with his performance - he held his own and kept the film going.Not a huge amount to say about anyone else; Hopkins is always great, my personal 'meh' regarding Portman continues (Foster seems to be a believable character, though so kudos) and Ecclston didn't get a huge amount in the way of screen time. Hiddleston was incredible. I leave him until last, because... well, he was incredible.*Effects*: Much like the first film, I thought the effects of this film were flawless. There are few films which have effects and graphical quality which match Thor, for some reason they are literally amazing, and better, in places than Iron Man 3.*Directing*: There is a scene where some Elves fight some Asgardians with flying ships - this to me felt way too Star Warsy. But other than that, Taylor did a good job.*Writing*: The effects and acting aside, the writing was one of the best bits if this film: it was surprisingly funny throughout, and the Old English way of speaking is continued well.*Fight Scenes*: *drools**Tone*: I loved this tone. Seriously, it gave hopelessness when it was necessary and I loved that because the audience needs to feel hopeless against the bad guy so that when the good guy wins it's just that much more satisfactory. And Loki just added a giant enigma to it. *Characters*: Loki is my main point regarding this; compared to Thor (1) he is very different, but nonetheless unpredictable. And because of Avengers, he has become even more so. Ergo, there's a bunch of moments where 'I did not see that coming.' Darcy, too, seems to have a larger part, which was fantastic. Having watched all the other films previously, I can now say I like Selvig's arc, and his character, while not required so much by the plot, helped continue on his story in a post-Avengers world.*Chris Hemsworth's Muscles*: He looks like a Nord when he takes his shirt off. It might be the hair.*Weaknesses/Drawbacks*: With Iron Man 3, I found the score to be great - and memorable because of it - so I therefore own several songs from the score album. However this score, not so much. I'll try listen harder on my second viewing, but I was not blown away by it (though I could hear Iron Man overtones...) I'm not sure if Agents of SHIELD have spoiled me for intra-Avengers references, but Chris Evans pops up and I'm not sure if its really necessary, though it was funny and nice to be reminded of the fact we're in the Avengers world. I didn't feel it was long enough. The midway-through-film action sequence in Asgard provided several battle sequences, all of which ended rather abruptly.And the funeral scene, while moving, felt long in comparison to the battle sequence. The scene itself I had no problem with, just the sequence before it. I also felt it missed something. I liked Jane Foster's input into defeating the bad guy, and the comedy was great, but I still feel there is something missing, and I can't quite put my finger on it.The 'intern', I felt, wasn't a necessary character. While it was somewhat nice for Darcy to have a guy, it's not like the audience, or indeed, Darcy, would have suffered if he wasn't there. And indeed, the plot would definitely not have suffered had he not been there. I guess that's my own particular approach to film-making.*Future Set-Ups/Questions*: The film does what all great franchise films do - make's the audience ask questions about the end and the franchise's future. Taylor has set up something that makes me want to explore. Mid- credits scene too, interests me - for those who don't know, it's Benicio del Toro and Guardians Of The Galaxy setting up that film, and probably Thanos in some way too. The post-credits scene is nothing special, though gives us a point about Thor on Earth, and is kinda funny (won't say why.)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Thor was a big gamble for Marvel in 2011. One of the campier Avengers who was surrounded by full-blown fantasy elements, the Norse God with a big red cape and hammer wasn't even being played by a well known star. What a difference two years and a box office behemoth in the form of The Avengers makes. This sequel comes with virtually no risk and a lead actor who is now a bona fide A-lister, but it also comes with much higher hopes. Swapping Kenneth Branagh's Shakespearian influence for Alan Taylor's Game of Thrones experience, The Dark World has decreased it's regality and amped up it's grittiness, yet thankfully retains its sense of fun. There's definitely a feel of greater peril here, with no-one but Thor seemingly out of Taylor's reach for a fatal ending, however for every scene of despair or Dark Elven malevolence, there's a hilarious gag (Loki's shapeshifting and any time Stellan Skarsgard's nutty scientist is on screen are highlights) waiting around the corner. The action set-pieces don't disappoint either; the climactic battle is inventive, if not mind-blowing, and a couple of earlier melees - including an attack on Asgard - are exhilarating and keep the pace moving swiftly along. What elevates this follow up though is the pairing of Thor (Chris Hemsworth) and Loki (Tom Hiddleston), who, after two previous movies to build up their brotherly baggage and perfect their repartee, are scintillating whether in the process of a daring escape or just engaging in some general chit chat. Fulfils its blockbuster quota of action spectacle whilst adding a healthy dose of spot-on humour and sharply written dialogue - what's not to like?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let me just start this by saying that I was not expecting great things from this movie, but Marvel has done it right again and i believe that anyone who enjoyed the first movie will not be disappointed with this one. The special effects were really cool and the Asgard scenes were amazing in IMAX 3D. The return of Thor and Loki was by far better than I expected. Loki was really better than in "The Avengers", it was more funny and more enjoyable to watch. The only negative point in this movie is the villain (Malekith) which is like an accessory to the story. Marvel Cinematic Universe is getting better and I cannot wait for "Guardians of the Galaxy". Definitely a surprise, "Thor: The Dark World" is one of those rare cases where the sequel beats its predecessor.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An entertaining sequel appealing to the general action-fantasy-SF market</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My summary line is not intended to suggest that "Thor" in any way belongs to the artsy niche. Still, with Kenneth Branagh at the helm, it has more than a normal share of plot complication, intriguing subtlety and character development. In the hand of Emmy-winning TV drama director Alan Taylor, the sequel "The dark world" is good action-driven entertainment. For a brief recap of the background (which, as mentioned, is quite complicated), I can perhaps refer to my review of "Thor" (2011): http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0800369/reviews-85The sequel comes with a much simpler plot. The titular reference is significant as the anchor for the main plot ? villains trying to plunge the universe into perpetual darkness. Another key element is something that you'll find in almost every movie of this genre ? an iconic object or substance. This time, it's an immensely powerful but rather elusive energy (looks like whiffs of red smoke, if you really have to know) that has found its way into Jane Foster's body. You can probably write the rest of the story just as capably as any screenwriter. Notice that I have not mentioned any names, for villain or substance. This is deliberate: why crowd this brief outline with unnecessary details?Patience in the anticipation of the loyal audience is rewarded, particularly those frustrated in not seeing Natalie Portman in "The Avengers" (2012). Here, she is all Jane Foster again ? scientist, sweetheart and, towards the end, not quite damsel-in-distress when she teams up with Stellan Skarsgard (reprising eccentric scientist Erik Selvig), using science to fight the baddies. Most of the other old friends are back. On the human world we have, cute as ever, Kat Dennings bringing back Darcy Lewis, plus a very funny newcomer Jonathan Howard as "the intern's intern". In the fantasy world, while Anthony Hopkins as King Odin is predictable, Renee Russo as Queen Frigga offers a delightful surprise with a beautiful action sequence wielding a deadly back-handed blade. Those delighted in Jamie Alexander's cool beauty will be happy to see that her Sif has taken on a slightly stronger role, but only in the action department and never a rival love interest. On the other hand, the role of the "Warriors Three" is reduced, with Hogun (Tadanobe Asano) dropped completely from action, reduced to a mere cameo. Idris Elba does his usual thing as Heimdall the guardian of the portal. As to the villain, it is difficult to measure up to Canada's treasure Colm Feore in "Thor" and in that light Christopher Eccleston does turn in a solid performance. That leaves the two male leads. Between "Thor" and this sequel, Chris Hemsworth has made other credible acting impressions, the best of which is flamboyant British Formula One racer James Hunt in "Rush" (2013). In "The dark world" we see him capably delivering a more matured and humane Thor. Tom Hiddleton as Loki is universally recognized as the brightest star in "Thor". Parallel to a matured Thor, then, is a mellowed and subdued Loki. There is nothing wrong with this direction which is consistent with the shift towards an action-driven movie, as mentioned. The serviceable plot and the satisfying action are well anchors in excellent visuals and impressive GCI. Perhaps not jubilant, they audience should nevertheless be well satisfied after the two-year wait.One last word: this movie comes with not just one, but two "appendixes". The first, the customary "hook" for what is to come, is shown immediately after the end of the movie, with a cameo of Benicio Del Toro who apparently will have a role in the next one. Then, after waiting patiently through the entire credit roll, the audience is rewarded with something that is really just part of the main body proper of the movie ? its ending minute that is cut away and placed at end of the credit roll.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Actually really rather good...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Review: For me the original Thor film was my second , least favourite Marvel adaptation after Captain America (sorry Capt.). It wasn't bad but it always felt like it was missing something special. Now, two years later and bolstered by an appearance alongside his Avengers buddies, the Blonde, buff god returns in what is a far more well rounded and successful movie.The Story: Faced with an enemy that even Odin and Asgard cannot withstand, Thor must embark on his most perilous and personal journey yet, one that will reunite him with Jane Foster and force him to sacrifice everything to save us all.Firstly let's get this out the way. Thor 2 is actually really good. Excellent in fact. Of all the Avengers films, it's probably the most 'together ' . It has a simple story, which moves at pace, with action and drama but keeping it tight enough to come in at under 2 hours. It even manages to get around (at least MOSTLY get around) the standard CGI monster fighting CGI good guy trope that has hobbled the end of every Avengers film since Iron Man.A large reason why the film works so well is the sublime decision to once again sit an unlikely candidate in the director's chair. Be it Jon Favreau for Iron Man or James Gunn for the upcoming Guardians Of The Galaxy, Marvel have a knack of picking the right man for the job. This time out respected TV and Game Of Thrones director Alan Taylor brings a more even vision to the film, much more suited to the material than Kenneth Branagh, and obviously revels in having a larger that his usual budget to play with. The action is clean and well shot, and best of all you can see every punch, every explosion and every insane flying spaceship moment.Oh and talking of flying Spaceship moments? director Taylor is obviously a fan of 80's cheese fest Flash Gordon, being that he borrows a considerable part of the films finale for the attack on Asgard. Not that I'm complaining as the mix of sci-fi, Norse legend, super hero and action make for a pleasant change form the usual Earth bound Marvel world.Hemsworth once again proves he is a man of considerable talent, delivering action alongside comedy and the occasional pathos. Naturally Natalie Portman has little to do (as is the female role generally in a Marvel film) but she remains a welcome addition, as does the returning Idris Elba, Tom Hiddleston (once again a stand out as Loki) and Anthony Hopkins (as his most gravelly). Rene Russo even gets to kick arse, which is nice. As for former Dr Who and professional grump Christopher Eccleston he does good with his limited bad guy role, but in reality with the added make up and FX it could have been anyone as Dark Elf leader Malekif.In truth the film has little against it, other than maybe an element of familiarity, and ends up being one of the best blockbusters of the year. Maybe not as good overall as Iron Man 3, but certainly more fun. For the most part.So overall a good script, great characters and some snappy dialogue alongside standout action sequences and a fast pace mean that deservedly Thor The Dark World will be another hit for Marvel. Truly a studio that cant seem to get it wrong.Reviewed By: Phil HobdenJoin the debate on our Facebook Group (www.facebook.com/groups/Filmsploitation) or on our website (www.thefilmpodcast.co.uk)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was worried that the color being so blue-ish and steel-like would distract me, along with the obviously make up artist change, but the story is very clever and well acted out. For whatever reason MARVEL spares no expense to add levity across the film to make the severe theme(s) less painful (without spoilers). Stay until after the entire credits sequence, and when you get home pre-order the DVD. Tom as Loki is priceless, and the Eric Selvig character actor is almost Cleese-like. It's nothing like Ironman 3 nor Wolverine, it's all MARVEL keeping in phase with the upcoming stories. You'll love how creative they get with Thor's Hammer as well - pay close attention to it toward the end of the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Busy, rushed and a little Generic but still a very winning and fun film as Lightning strikes twice, even if not in the same place!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Saw this at a midnight premiere in the UK.Thor, like Iron Man, is a Marvel comics stalwart who is now world famous largely thanks to the recent movie series. The first instalment was a very unusual comic book film, being part Earthbound fish out of water comedy and part intimate family drama in the lofty heights of Asgaard, a labour of love from distinguished Shakespearian Kenneth Brannagh, whose main purpose was to introduce most of the key players and plot drives for the upcoming "Avengers" movie. That has now come, been seen and conquered, so now comes the second stand alone. Without another movie to set up, and without Brannagh at the helm, it is a more conventional sort of "superhero" movie, with a nefarious enemy at the head of a literally faceless army and huge blade shaped spaceships intent on universal Armageddon via a newly introduced super McGuffin weapon that must be stopped at the last second, etc. It does however boast (A) lots of spectacular action, and more importantly (B) all the original cast returning, now old friends riding on the love they've earned in the previous 2 movies.The story concerns the "Dark Elves", who existed before the known Universe of the tree of life was created and who want things back to how they used to be (dark) before these pesky "light" beings came about. (That is their only motivation) Defeated eons ago by Asgard, their super weapon, the Aether, a red hued dark matter polip, was buried somewhere where it could never be found: the London borough of Greenwich, Earth! And who but Thor's love interest and most annoying physicist ever Jane Foster (Portman) with her wisecracking sidekick Darcy (Kat Dennings) and her own personal male understudy in tow should stumble upon it during their inter-dimensional research? The stuff is causing weird phenomena to happen, since the 9 realms are entering into their 5,000 year "alignment", the only time the Aether can be used to destroy all, and the stuff enters Portman Venom style and makes her its doomed human host. Thor (Hemsworth) who meanwhile has been leading the clean-up of the 9 realms (Asgaard is still the universe's policeman) is alerted and takes the opportunity to whisk the love of his life back to Asgaard so she can get treated. Father Odin (Hopkins) who is not too hot on him having a mere "human" bride anyway refuses to have her in the city, and with good reason since it provokes an attack from the newly resurgent dark elves led by their leader Malakeith (Christopher Eccleston) using the old "get yourself captured then attack from within" strategy and soon Asgaard is ablaze in a Star Wars style space fighter battle between Elf blade ships and Asgaardian fighters (which look like little Viking ships with wings!) and an assault on the palace which inflicts many casualties, and slaying in battle Odin's beloved wife Frigg (Rene Russo) Driven mad by rage, Odin plans to use Jane to tempt the elves back so he can wipe them all out. Thor on the other hand, now voice of reason (1st movie 360 degrees) and not wanting to lose his beloved, conspires with guardian Heimdall (Elba) and his 4 companions (Alexander, Stevenson, Levi and Asanabou) to launch an elaborate jail break that springs both Jane and the now imprisoned Loki (Hiddleston), himself in despair for the loss of his beloved foster mother, to get the Aether out of Jane and stop the dark elves using the alignment. What follows is another fighter battle through Asgaard, lots of post-Avengers Thor and Loki bonding and bickering, the springing of the now mentally unstable post-Avengers Dr Erik Selvig (Skaarsgard) from a mental institution, and a series of increasingly confusing and downright surreal encounters with Malakeith and the elves as they fall through various dimensions and time zones, ending up with the Elf ship embedded in Greenwich's famous naval academy and museum where the last battle for life as we know it takes place, with all players, Human and Asgaardian on the ball.As you might gather from that précis, there is a lot of plot here that happens very fast, perhaps too fast. There is also lots of sci-fi action involving exotic fighter dogfights and laser battles between medieval fashioned armies in classical architecture that makes one feel he is watching a "Star Wars" prequel a lot of the time (especially with Portman around). However the film manages to include the two winning elements of Thor 1, the unique dramatic character interplay between the tortured Asgaardian elite and perfectly timed comedy, mostly thanks to the Dennings-Skaarsgard-Portman crowd but with Thor, now no longer a stranger on Earth, being perhaps too at ease in Midgard, such as when he hangs up his hammer on a coat stand, or follows 007 in taking our London Underground during a mission. The direction by Game of Thrones director Alan Taylor is fine, and the acting all round is superb. One feels sorry though for Eccleston, who is meant to be the big villain but is mostly one note and generic, and not only has half his face blown off midway to become "Harvey two-elf" for no real reason but also seems to have lost a lot of his screen time too. The London locations (especially Greenwich) are again fun for us Londoners, after 007 and FnF set their latest adventures here.If there are drawbacks, it is that it is too busy, perhaps too rushed, too generic and has too many things jostling for space. But it is a fun film, exciting, dramatic and full of post "Avengers" events. PS- Hang around for the 2 post credits scenes at the end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film worthy of Thor</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I loved Thor's original introduction, I think Kenneth set a prime example for the mythologies, and this film exceeds and refines the efforts that came before.The score was terrific, characters alive, and the effects stunning. The screenplay balancing humour and emotion stunningly well. Thor: The Dark World is my favourite Avengers outing thus far, Captain America shouldn't disappoint either.Criticism and Spoilers However, I did think that Odin was too solid of a character, not encompassing the mythology of his role, or mirroring examples seen in other Marvel animated movies.Reference to Jodenheim was good, and I hope Loki's 'see you in hell' line will be a reference to his participation in a Surtur storyline for Thor 3, maybe so given Marvel's interest in maintaining his involvement due to his fan following.What I thought should have changed - was that Odin intervene in the end by means of the Tesseract, aka cosmic cube - to combat the aether spread, as it would bring a much more direct contrast to the artifacts, and interest in Odin's armoury again.Iron Man should have at least been in touch somehow, worldwide panic is a big deal lol, but Cap's inclusion was hilarious (and maybe referencing skrulls later), but again is no big deal as Iron Man 3 could have said the same thing about including shield and Cap.I didn't like the fact that the collector was portrayed so strangely, and not introduced, but I'm guessing that will come later. Thor should have fought the horned guy longer, making Malekith a trickier enemy calling for Odin - who would have come down to earth to help, and then coming to terms with human interaction - acknowledging his saving them in the past with the frost giants in himself etc.Also - I think he should have revived Freya with the Cube if it were possible - maybe revealing after Thor and Loki banded together - and locking Loki away (although proud of his progress). And the ending was somewhat misrepresented - I think if Loki was to take over Asgard (which he believably could after that speech) - he would use an artifact, reflecting the scene in Thor with the casket - but I think he should have fled to Jodenheim with the creature at the end."There is a purpose to everything your father does" - 9 out of 10, a triumph for the genre.</fullReview>

And you miss a part of the story. As the plot and movie itself I am not saying it is bad. But some solutions are just stupid. I like Marvel a lot but in this movie I am missing the feeling of the Marvel universe. Just to say 1 thing. If you have an army as strong like in the Avengers , why is Thor fighting them alone. Why is iron man not helping, Captain America or even the hulk. The army was there to shoot at the spaceship. So there are gaps in the story and the 3d version sucked to make a final opinion on the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another outstanding effort, Marvel does it yet again!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's hard to believe that a movie with this subject matter can make you think as much as it thrills you and makes you laugh. Yet, this film does just that. It really does appeal to all of your movie viewing skills. It's very artistic and you would expect no less from a director that crafted Game of Thrones. He presents the entire film in a way that can be savored. Many aspects are classical drama and yet other aspects are just plain old fun kick-butt action scenes. It's a perfect blend and this movie is far deeper then I would've thought. The pacing was perfect as is the indirect link to the Marvel movie Universe... I can't wait to see what Captain America brings us in his sequel.Also, I absolutely love the character of Loki because there was so much texture to the character. He's the perfect Marvel villain. He was complex but with a tinge of madness mixed in and perfectly written for the film. The rationale for what he does and how he behaves is masterful. I truly loved how Loki was written and portrayed. Then again, I honestly can say that about all the main characters. Thor and Jane really are allowed to shine here as well.My main critique after watching the first film was the instance romance between Jane and Thor. After watching this movie, you buy the love at first sight scenario boosted by the situational intrigue. This time around, the pace of the film really worked well. I can't remember a film that grabs you like they do right off the bat and never lets go but does it with intelligence and heart. Hard to argue any editorial cuts at this point whatever they may have been.Overall, a movie that's superior to everything else that I've seen this year.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thor: The Dark World</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Thor: The Dark World is a Marvel action fantasy film that director Allen Taylor takes you on an adventure with the god of thunder to save his beloved, Jane Foster, from the evil that consumes her. Following in the expectations of all Marvel movies, Thor: The Dark World is packed with amazing actors and actresses, a setting that helps you feel as though Asgard is a real place, and a well-developed cast. What more could you ask for? For starters let's talk about the fact that all Marvel movies have these actors that fit each part perfectly. It almost seems like they are all planted in a garden and perfected until it is time for their shot in a movie. For instance Chris Hemsworth, who just happens to be 6'4" with a godlike body, becomes Thor in the movie. No matter what other character he plays in any other movie, we will forever be known as Thor, the god of thunder. Another example would be Tom Hiddleston, who also just happens to be 6'4 with a villain like persona, transforms into Loki, the god of mischief. These two men will never escape the identity of Thor and Loki, unless they are some other type of species like Anthony Hopkins. When Anthony Hopkins plays a character, you only see him as that one character, during that one movie. During the movie it didn't click in my head that he was Hannibal Lector, all that I saw was Odin. The cast for this movie was unbelievable, not only were the men amazing but the women were fantastic. (Spoiler alert) Kate Dennings plays Darcy Lewis the intern of Jane Foster, who decides she needs an intern herself. Speaking of their relationship Jane decides it's time to start dating, so obviously something would go wrong that Darcy would need to crash her date, eat some of their breadsticks, and convince her to leave. Not only is Darcy hilarious but her intern is funny as well, so is Eric Selvig.Anyway, the set design was crazy amazing. Inside the Asgardian Castle was so well constructed that it makes you feel like you're really there. Not only were the set designs great but the graphics were fantastic. They didn't look like the scenes were filmed in front of a green screen, but looks like they're actually doing everything that we see on the screen. To tie everything together, the costume designers who fashioned the clothing and the wigs to look as if it should actually be authentic Asgardian clothing. The detail on Thor's armor really represents his status and his character's personality of not only a warrior, but a leader as well. The designers also put a lot of thought into Loki's breakdown scene; his clothes weren't perfectly pressed, but truly focused on the element of pain that he was experiencing.Not to throw shade on the first movie, but this movie flowed a lot better than the first. The characters were more established, there was no need to add any exposition explaining who this is and what he does and so on, because the foundation was already laid out from the first movie. The characters themselves have grown as well since the first movie; you really begin to see Loki and Thor as brothers when they escape in the enemy's ship. You also begin to see that Thor truly loves Jane, not an infatuation like Romeo and Juliet, but an actual deep love for her. You no longer just see Loki as the angry, spoiled, handsome villain, but instead you see him as this man who just wants to be loved. He wants the same love that he sees Odin has for Thor. You see him lose the one person he actually loves, his mom. You see the part of him that you feel you can not only trust but love and have sympathy for.For me, Thor: The Dark World catapulted Marvel movies to the next level. Through every scene you never once wonder "when will this movie end?" It's like a good home cooked meal, you just want more and looking forward to the next one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Thor: The Dark World, is one of the best 2013 Marvel movies. It gives you smiles, tears, &amp; jaw dropping moments. If you love Marvel movies &amp; have not seen this movie I recommend seeing it. No spoilers here, so it's 10 out of 10 for me. I loved it and all of the other Avenger movies. I hope you like this review and enjoy every MARVEL movie out there like me. Not all MARVEL suck. They have gotten better over the past years. I don't see why you wouldn't want to waste you money on this movie. Iron Man, The Hulk, Captain America, Thor, Black Widow &amp; Hawkeye are for sure the best MARVEL heroes out there. You can for sure trust me on that. :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thor: The Confusing World</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remembered my initial thought when watching this movie for the first time; I thought it was utter crap. First of all, I didn't understand what was going on and I keep wondering when the real plot line will begin when it was already half of the movie. Things felt it like it was a blur, it was moving too fast but it didn't have content. I felt rather confused after watching the movie. I had to consult with my friend who is a comic expert in order to fully understand the movie. Based on that, I thought the movie did very poorly. What do I think about it now? After watching it for a second time in better quality, I was able to piece things together better. However, keep in mind that I researched and knew more about the plot line from another source. Because of that, I still feel that the movie did poorly. Not as poorly as my initial judgement but still rather poor especially after watching and comparing it to the first movie. They had a good thing going on in Thor 1 as it was different from other Superhero movies; it centred around the character rather than the action. They should have stick to this formula, but I guess after the launching of the Avengers movie, they were high on action steroids. Not to say that action movies are bad. They are definitely interesting. I just think they were trying too hard in this movie, which complicate it. I know that a lot of people and myself included watched this movie as we were already invested in the characters, especially Loki. And that was basically the only part that hold up the movie; Loki. Without him, the movie would definitely fall apart. He had the only emotional depth and lines of the movie. The dark elves plot line and another infinity stone made it rather difficult for people to digest or understand the movie. Now as a comic book fan and reader, I knew a bit about it and I was still left rather confused. So, I would just imagine how people who did not read the comics felt like; maybe ignorant is bliss? It made more sense though when it was explained and made it a better movie. For example, the place where Jane stumbled on and got infected was suppose to be the hardest place to find. However, she found it rather easily. So how do I judge this? as it was an 'OK' movie after I knew the facts but it was a poor movie before I looked into it. Nothing much to touch on the cinematography. It was still good. No complains there. Everything looked believable and the shots used in the movie were good. I was disappointed in the score though. I guess it suited the movie as it was rather fast paced which is reflected in the score. It wasn't the emotional build up that was created by Patrick Doyle in the first movie. I hope if they do another Thor movie they will learn from this second movie mistake and revert back to the first movie's simplicity; more insight on the characters. If not, then I say forget about doing another Thor movie and just do a Loki movie. I mean, that's what the fans actually really want.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film tells the story of Thor and his battle against the dark forces who are fighting for the control of the source of evil power called Aether."Thor" is visually impressive, with many scenes of epic battles in impressively portrayed imaginary worlds. I was also impressed with the scene where Jane Foster floats in the air, emanating rents and blackness. It's a scene lifted out of a horror film but works so well in this story. I liked the London in crisis scenes too. The jokes in the film don't really work though, they aren't so clever and aren't that funny. Nonetheless, the film still entertains and delivers marvellous visuals, making it a more than adequate blockbuster.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than the first</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I enjoyed the first Thor and I was looking forward to the Dark World and it didn't disappoint in a sense. For one reason, I didn't go to see Thor: The Dark World for a deep movie experience but for a fun action movie. But I knew coming in what I was going to see and I had a fun time watching this movie. The movie is directed by Alan Taylor and he expands on the world of Asgard and creates great battle scenes in this movie. But the movie more or less is just another marvel action movie. The movie has its moments but certain aspects of the movie are off. For one example, Thor and Jane Fosters relationship feels somewhat forced and unnatural. And Thor's villain, Malekith, isn't very well developed and is probably one of my least favorite villains of all the Marvel movies. But Loki played by Tom Hiddleston is an excellent character and his always entertaining when on screen. But other than Loki the other characters are just more or less there to carry the story. The story isn't bad but as I've said I wish certain things were better developed. Thor: The Dark World is definitely a movie I would recommend you go see if you want to have some fun. It's action is great and this great movie to see with the family, with date, with friends, or just your self. Better than average movie but gave me thorough enjoyment through the filmVerdict:6/10 better than an average movie</fullReview>

If you are looking a typical Marvel action/fun, then you would enjoy it. But if you are looking for something more then just action and some laughs, then you might end up a little disappointed! The team up between Thor and Loki was the best part about the movie, but it wasn't enough for me, i wanted more then just brotherhood, maybe a better plot, something more complicated that would make this movie more like a twist! There is of course some scenes you might get surprised but not me :(PS. you might witness tons of funny moments, some of them are "trying to hard" moments.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It wasn't a very good start but the ending was superb. Thor 2: The Dark World was a fantastic movie yet boring. It was like Iron Man 2 which is full of dead scenes and conversation. The movie consists of 50% talking and 50% amazing fighting scenes. lots of funny parts though.I'm not a Thor fan. I'm a Loki fan that's why I'm seeing the movie. The movie was very deep which is at some point, non fans couldn't understand at all like fans need to explain the scenes for them to understand. The CGI effects were too bright and look unrealistic at all. They should've worked on it.The story focuses on the battle between Malekith, who wants to destroy the universe and the Asgardians after taking the Aether from Jane Forster's body. Loki helped Thor and used the opportunity on becoming a king. The mid credits scene explains the Aether as part of the six gems on the Infinity Gauntlet. The Collector kept it which leads to the storyline of "The Guardian of The Galaxy" in the future where we might see Thanos using it to conquer the universe.I rated it 80%. Not bad for a Marvel Movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I go to a Marvel Comics film I expect to see action and this one has that. Usually there is some humor, and this one has that too. It does show some of the spirit of Stan Lee as he is on the crew that worked on this one.Overall a solid movie entry to the Thor series. It does has a talented cast - first movie I have seen Natalie Portman in since she turned 30. So far the maturity of the big 30 is holding up well on her.There is some very good things for Thor to build on here. While it is not perfect, it is solid. For anyone who left the theater early, better come back and check some very important scenes that happen during the credits.Anthony Hopkins once again adds another solid performance as Odin to his resume of films.The film does contain itself to about 2 hours which is great as some of these films get so wrapped up in action that they get boring when they go beyond that time and get boring.The settings are impressive, maybe even more so in 3D but I did not watch that version. Thors hammer rings up another score.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ever since I watched the first Thor movie, I had this feeling that this superhero will not evolve into a great movie. Because frankly, Thor 1 sucked. This sequel proves me, well, almost wrong. There are three things this movie improved: 1. plot 2. visual effect 3. character developmentFor the first point, I think Marvel - ever since the Avengers - has been working a lot on a serious and full of twists plot. This movie tried to do that but I think they could do a little better. There are a lot of ends that they could expand, such as: when Jane was in possession of the Aether, she had visions and strange things happening to her body that Thor thought he had to bring her in to Asgard to cure. But instead of curing and before anything big enough for the story could happen to her, Malekith sucks the Aether out of her. The story could elaborate on how Thor tries to save her instead of letting her roam lazily doing nothing in Asgard. Or is it an attempt to clash Jane with Sif who also has feelings for Thor? If it were then I don't think this movie gives you enough of that. Or is it the prelude to Thor 3 which would open up more on Jane and Asgard? This one we shall wait and see.Visual effect: average. I don't see anything new in this movie that I haven't seen before in any other movie. Nothing I could elaborate. Harry Potter movies have better ideas on this one. As for character development, this movie is moving so fast that the characters had no chance to introduce and tell us if they have something more than we see in the screen. Loki has a riff of emotion in this story but that too felt too quick and premature. Even the ending is weird for me.All in all, a good movie but it could use a little more improvement.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Mundane Epic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the sort of film that I could write and rewrite a review of several times, attempting to find just the right thing to say. For the sake of avoiding that, I will be brief.Thor: The Dark World brings more characters and a wider scope of a story (and superb visual effects) into play, relative to its predecessor. Unfortunately, it loses the warmth and simple beauty that was present the first time around and suffers from an extremely clichéd, uninspiring and ultimately uninteresting execution of the overall plot. Viscerally, it is like watching handfuls of charcoal pencils repeatedly crushed for a couple of hours. Dark, yes, but compelling, no.It is not a "bad" film per se. It is just not particularly good, in my opinion. In the theater, it felt very lengthy and I was fatigued as a viewer, which either means that it is too long, or has the effect of being so. Either way, not a good thing.In particular, the villain is underdeveloped, as is the relationship arc between Thor and Jane. Generally, the story is clear and easy to follow, but it is a bit cluttered to the point of meandering effect, and does not manage to escape a certain pervasive dullness. The employment of humor is a double-edged sword ? it undermines the needed elegant seriousness of the story, while at the same time mercifully making it watchable.I want to note a few scenes, though, that do impress and inspire me. Early in the film, a few moments are spent in a tavern and in the street outside, somewhere relatively pedestrian in Asgard. It feels wintry and almost like A Christmas Carol. It also feels more personable than most of what follows. There is a beautiful funeral scene as well, very evocative and for me, a return to the mythological pleasures of the first Thor film. Finally, a scene in which Frigga engages in mesmerizing hand-to-hand combat with the villain. These are instances in which I can feel the potential for how great a Thor film COULD be, with a truly great character-driven story and the right director. Here's hoping for next time.Overall, technically decent but a mundane viewer experience. To put a different way, less than the sum of its parts. I would group this film with The Incredible Hulk and Iron Man 2 as Marvel Studios' least interesting installments so far. 6.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A crammed cinema-going for the weekend is a belated diversion since not too much going on for the past month in the burgeoning Chinese market. The chapter one THOR (2011, 5/10) and the mega-amalgam THE AVENGERS (2012, 5/10) didn't lure me into Thor's fan base, but this sequel does boost the franchise's morals by further intermingling the epic apocalypse between the vast Gods' realm and the puny but ego-maniacal earth, saw it in its over-charged 3D version (nearly impossible to find a 2D screening nearby), THOR: THE DARK WORLD is a massive crowd- pleaser, terrific art production and the trappings of a Marvel vehicle, shrewdly fictionalizes the love-and-hatred bromance between Thor and Loki, which is much hyped as the dominant draw for this action-packed escapade. There is darkness before the birth of the universe, so as to against the plot of Malekith (Eccleston) to utilize an amorphous weapon called Aether to set the universe back into pitch- blackness, Thor (Hemsworth) has to team up with Loki (Hiddleston) to rescue his earth girlfriend Jane (Portman) who has been infected by Aether and being pursed by Malekith and his toadies, notably, a mutated fiend Algrim (Akinnuoye-Agbaje). Whiling the most entertaining part comes the polarized tenors of the Asgard kingdom and the contemporary earth, one is solemn, majestic, atavistic and Shakespearean (thanks to Kenneth Branagh for setting the tone in THOR 2011) and the other (this time the locale is an overcast London) is glossy, modern, farcical and doomed to be pulverized. The spectacles are generally gratifying and on a par with the earlier IRON MAN 3 (2013, 6/10) to say the least. Wonderful comic relief from the earthbound trio, Dennings, Skarsg?rd and Howard plus a surprising cameo by O'Dowd. Hemsworth and Portman are predictably playing the hero and his fearless girlfriend-in-danger default while Hiddleston easily grabs all the attention by influencing meatier character development, more ambiguous in his stance and a timely twist in the end can suffice to ignite fans' passion to the next installment, or maybe a Loki-based spin- off which will be more intriguing and anti-trend in its own way. By any means it is a solid sequel which inherits the merits from its predecessor and put more verve into its gods vs. mortals contradiction, director Alan Taylor has well handled a hot potato, next step, sit and wait for CAPTAIN America: THE WINTER SOLDIER (2014) coming this upcoming April.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Firstly, let me get this straight, this is a Thor movie, and not the Dark Knight - so don't go to the movie as a critic or for a memorable evening. The movie however does what it is meant to do - i.e. entertain. Don't go looking for logic, questioning at times that if Thor can fly, then why does he need to take a subway or a taxi. Natalie Portman is given her due share of screen time.The build-up to the story is good, better than some of the recent superhero movies, and the special effects give a lot of life to the movie during the first hour. Performances are quite decent. Loki stands out and maintains is stature as someone who can constantly surprise you.What really disappointed me was the way Thor saved the nine realms. He did something that worked (had to obviously as he is the superhero). I am not even sure if the writers and director were sure about the logic that was used for defeating the dark side. Honestly, I think it could have been a good movie if they could get the end right, but the movie still meets the purpose, which is thrill, entertain and dazzle, and then forget once the movie is over.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although the reprehensible Loki has been captured and imprisoned for his various crimes, dark times still lie ahead not just for Asgard, but for all of the Nine Realms. Malekith?the ruler of an evil race known as the Dark Elves?has awakened after eons of hibernation and seeks to use a powerful weapon known as the Aether to leave the universe in darkness. Knowing that Malekith and his army will be too much for Asgard to overcome, Thor must reunite with Jane Foster and reluctantly recruit Loki for a perilous mission to try and save all. Made watchable by memorable fight scenes, excellent special effects, and a good sense of humor, but suffers from a standard storyline, as well as some poorly developed supporting characters and subplots. Hemsworth?now appearing as if he could play the role in his sleep?is again a force in the lead, but no one has more fun than Hiddleston who goes for broke as the villainous Loki. Acceptable entertainment, but the results are still slightly underwhelming. **?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Given, it has thrilling action sequences, WHEN they appear. CG is fine, in 3D they look cool and fantastic. Acting is average, but some characters you should watch out for are.... Odin, his queen and the Asgard Gate Keeper. Awesome characters written beautiful; laded with honer, commanding obeisance, expressing legions and affection to their kin, in their own subtle yet exuberant fashion. Characters that were very well filled in with actors who are know to execute such roles with color and fines of master painter.When it comes to Thor and his conversation with the male counterparts in the movie, he speaks like he should, like Son Of Odin! However things change quickly when he is talking to his girlfriend, it gets little mushy, in a cheesy way. And Thor's hammer looses weight a couple of times, I mean literately. (Reminds me of my nephews Halloween costumes, that scare the s*** out of my dog) Characters from the dark side lack a good introduction, and a follow through. Which make it little hard to really submerge into the move. Some of the ends are loosely tied. Their mother ship looses some serious weight, from the first half of the move to the second, almost gives me proportion creeps, now that I am thinking about it. (you will know what I am talking about when you watch the movie) However they were acted out well.Over all enjoyable move. It has good thrilling action sequence which gets your blood pumping, earthlings are lil disappointing, don't mind them, go see the movie! There is a good chance you might like it!!! Oh, and get some caffeine in to your system, you will feel pumped like the teenagers next to me in the theater, they sure enjoyed the move!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pros: Its Thor and it will always be entertaining. Comic scenes are perfect and make you laugh. The second half has some great visual effects and good action. The climax fight is what most of the people dint like in the reviews but I loved it. Chris Hemsworth has owned the character and I can't imagine anyone else in that outfit now. Loki is funny and intriguing. Overall a good package but not as good as the first installment.Cons: Comic scenes were good but there were too many. If you wanted it to be dark, you will be a bit disappointed. As a character, Malekith was not developed properly. The story does not revolve much around him even though he is the main villain of the movie. The first half was a bit dull as compared to the second half. The 3d effects are not up to the mark and i was feeling irritated watching it in 3D as there was nothing so great about them that I had to watch everything with a tint of black.Overall if you like Thor, you will like the movie. He is my favorite Marvel character (of course after Tony Stark). Natalie Portman has nothing much to do except being a mess or the source of problems for Thor and Asgard.The post credit scene reveals a bit about Avengers: Age of Ultron and was worth waiting for.The post post credit scene is something you may as well skip as it's definitely not worth the wait.I liked the movie but wanted it to be better.7 on 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"You must be truly desperate to come to me for help."The second phase of the Marvel universe began this summer with Iron Man 3 which was a film I enjoyed very much, but really hasn't seemed to stick with me. I'm afraid the same problem can be said about Thor: The Dark World, which was an entertaining movie but I don't think I'd enjoy it as much on a second viewing. Most of these films are fun and exciting as you experience them for the first time, but the magic seems to vanish for me after a few weeks. Perhaps The Avengers was so great that these sequels don't seem to live up to the standard set by Joss Whedon. I still had a great time in the movies and enjoyed the sequel to Thor considering I wasn't blown away by the first film either. By now Thor knows exactly who he is and doesn't have to prove anything to anyone, so we get to see him in action with his might hammer quite a bit. At times the film has a sort of Star Wars vibe to it mixed with The Lord of the Rings (with Jane reminding me of Frodo), but the final action scene suffers from something we've seen in way too many superhero films recently: buildings getting completely destroyed and blown up. It also mixes some elements near the end that we've seen in Jumper, but all in all the film succeeds thanks to the great chemistry between Chris Hemsworth and Tom Hiddleston. The way they played off each other and interacted was the highlight of the film, and Hiddleston was extremely funny here. I wasn't a huge fan of his in the first Thor, but after The Avengers I began to enjoy his performance, and his character in this sequel is better than ever. I wasn't blown away by the action scenes, but I did like the smaller comedic and light moments which the film had to offer. The film is entertaining enough to garner at least one watch.The film picks up after the events of The Avengers with Thor (Chris Hemsworth) back in Asgard serving his father Odin (Anthony Hopkins) trying to restore peace to the nine realms that his brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston) has altered. Loki is sentenced to prison after his mother Frigga (Rene Russo) insists he shouldn't be killed. It turns out to be a good decision because Thor will need his service after the city is attacked by a race of beings known as the Dark Elves. Their leader, Malekith (Christopher Eccleston), is searching for a weapon known as the Aether which had been taken away from him thousands of years ago by Odin's father. Since the aether couldn't be destroyed, the Asgardians had to hide it. In the meantime Jane (Natalie Portman), who hasn't seen or heard from Thor since he left two years ago, along with her assistant Darcy (Kat Dennings) discover an anomaly very similar to the one that had brought Thor to Earth in the past. When she goes to investigate she is sucked by some sort of wormhole and ends up right next to the place where the aether had been hidden. After Heimdall (Idris Elba) warns Thor that Jane has disappeared, he goes after her, but somehow Jane has awaken Malekith which is what provoked his attack in Asgard in the first place.Thor: The Dark World is pretty generic and follows a similar formula of most superhero films. That is the reason why so many scenes remind us of other scenes we've seen in other action films. I was never at the edge of my seat during any of the action scenes, but I did have a great time with the light and funny moments. Some people actually enjoyed the action sequences in this film, but it really didn't do anything new for me. The highlight of the film for me was Tom Hiddleston and the scenes he was in were probably the most memorable of the movie. Jamie Alexander, Zachary Levi, and Ray Stevenson all return for their supporting roles here as Thor's soldier/warriors but their characters aren't really developed too much. It is strange to see a summer blockbuster film in November but I guess that the timing was right considering all the superhero films that came out this year. Thor doesn't stand out (and I guess none really did this year), but it is still an entertaining movie. This Marvel universe is growing so fast with all these films that at times it feels like a TV series. So I guess it was a good idea that they brought in the Game of Thrones director, Alan Taylor. He has made an enjoyable film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thor- a bore...?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Given the possibilities, it's more than a little disappointing that the makers of THOR: THE DARK WORLD would opt to do a story about "dark elves." For one thing, there WERE no dark elves in the original comics- not ONE, that I can recall. (Granted, "this ain't your daddy's Thor," but it IS, just revamped for today's less discriminating moviegoers.) Why not do a story about Ulik, mightiest of the Rock Trolls...? ('Cause this ain't your daddy's Thor...?) To see the mighty troll marshal his army to invade Asgard itself would've been great. Consider: We see an Asgradian outpost on the edge of the Troll Lands. Battle-armored trolls attack the outpost (using the widest array of weapons imaginable, forged in their underground furnaces). Cut to another outpost, as trolls emerge from underground to attack and capture it. Thor (wearing his trademarked helmet, which he DOESN'T in THOR: THE DARK WORLD) gathers his men for a counter-attack. The armies battle to a standstill- at which point Ulik steps forth to challenge Thor to a one-on-one slugfest (no cgi, just breakaway boulders and such). Here, we discover that Loki has had a hand in the troll invasion, giving them strategic information every step of the way. Thor, to overcome superior numbers, calls forth a thunderstorm that wipes the troll army back from whence it came. Compare THAT scenario to what we see in THE DARK WORLD. I don't think I've seen a movie with so many clichéd lines in quite a while. While the makeup effects and the cgi are better than in the first film, the story is every bit as ponderous: scenes drag on interminably at times, with pompous characters hammering the point(s) mercilessly- and the attempts at humor, while they might garner the occasional chuckle, are sophomoric at best and are used more often than not to undermine the "seriousness" of the situation(s). And am I the only one more than a little tired of the post-credit "tag" scenes? (We were subjected to a half hour of television commercials prior to half an hour of previews BEFORE the movie started- then we had to sit through ten minutes of production crew credits before the last scene. Come on, people- give us a break.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not so dark</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This follow up was supposed to be darker than the last. It is a bit darker, but not quite as advertised. I know it is popular these days to make an origin story or sequel even darker to attract audiences and works for the most part. It's just not quite as dark overall as the previews make it seem. Part of it is for sure, but it's no "Empire Strikes Back."The film is at its best when Thor wields his armor and is in action. This happens much more in the second half but still not quite enough in my opinion, but that's me, an action junkie. The earthly scientists seem like an added on annoyance and that part of the "convenient" plot doesn't quite click until the end of the film. The climax is pretty entertaining, as there is a lot of flying, world traveling, portal jumping, hammer flying, action.Characters: Thor (Hemsworth) and Loki (Hiddleston) are the centerpieces here. There's a storyline with Thor and a "friend" from Azguard that his dad would like him to court that is interesting and would be cool to see fleshed out, but at under 2 hrs total for the run time, there's just no time. I was glad to see Jane (Portman) back, and the director does a good job of not making her feel like just a third wheel, although there are times I wish she would just stay on earth and let the demi gods do their work.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not exactly flawless.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Overall, I have to say that I did enjoy the film. But there are a few things that came to mind and they're pretty annoying. First, is Asgard's defense so weak that their enemy can enter the main palace so easily? Where were Odin when Frigga was attacked by Malekith and his ally? Would the protection of their Queen be so lame? I don't get it. Second, if some alien are doing some destruction of that magnitude like what Malekith is doing at Greenwich which is on earth, wouldn't the other members of Avengers have heard about it? I just think it'd be more believable if that final scene doesn't happen on earth. That's all. Sorry for ranting, I just couldn't help it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't know, everybody seems to like this outing, so maybe I just wasn't in the right mood for it.But from the beginning, I felt the movie was trying too hard to impress, like someone had this idea: "Hey, Lord of the Rings is awesome, so let's put some elves and other fantasy creatures on this, and while we are at it, you know that cool sound effect of the light sabers from Star Wars? Let's add this too! After all, we have Princess Amidala in our cast! Oh, wait! I saw this movie the other day, 'Star Trek: Into Darkness' and it was f*ing a-m-a-z-i-n-g! What about having Loki resemble Khan, and we could also borrow from the title too, let's call this sequel 'Dark' something... let me see... Oh, I got it! Dark World!" I could go on and cite moments that reminded me of John Carter, King Kong, X-Men and so forth...Don't get me wrong, the movie is not bad, but at least to me, it felt too much like a 'montage' from other movies.I liked the first one very much, so maybe my expectations were too high. I'd still recommend it though.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the worst hero movie from Marvel I have seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Firstly,I feel lucky cause I didn't go to the cinema but wait and download it.From the beginning to the scene mother of Thor and Loki die there are no problem but suddenly the movie goes down terribly,especially when the audience just witness she die and the funeral (which is very beautiful and emotional)the director decides to show us the scene Dr.Erik Selvig was talking with shoes which means to entertain the audience.Then, There are so many lame and ridiculous acts or conversation.All of funny moments or fighting are very predictable and sometime awkward.I can understand that if you want to make a movie contains funny and good fighting scene like The Avenger is not an easy task but at least order the scene logically to avoid unstable feeling from audience.However, Thor: The Dark World is not a bad idea for someone who are looking for a gentle not complicate movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent but not enough Loki or Frigga</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was an excellent installment in the Marvel Universe. As always Tom Hiddleston steals the show with his Loki. However it should be noted that he is not in the film anywhere near enough as he should be. The pairing of Tom and Chris as Loki and Thor is always great viewing and sadly there is not enough funny duo action. It has been noted that the film is a lot shorter than most and a fair few good scenes have not made the final cut, mainly Loki, Loki and Thor and Thor and Frigga. Saying that the film is great with a brilliant cast. Anthony Hopkins does seem a bit wooden in this but it is due to Odin aging and the fact I think he has just had enough of the situation in Asgard. It is very much worth a look and more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The corniness of dialogue and convoluted elements don't keep The Dark World from being an entertaining and appropriately funny addition to the Avengers universe.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Thor: The Dark World" has problems. Actually, it has a few problems. The battle scenes are generic. The editing is sloppy. There are moments of cheese, and the dialogue needs some spicing up. Most dubious is the confusing main conflict with the forgettable villain, Malekith. However, despite the corniness and the convoluted elements plaguing it, "The Dark World" is a highly entertaining, engaging, and surprisingly funny addition to The Avengers universe. In order to buy into these Thor films, one must be okay with Thor being a stupid, albeit fun, Marvel character. Sure, his entire lore is hokey, but it is intentionally so, and the filmmakers behind this installment are well aware of this, using it to their benefit in great humorous effect. And while Portman seems bored playing love interest Jane, most other performances are strong and lively. Hemsworth, Dennings, and Skarsgard are better fleshed out and play their roles with ease. However, the real winner here is Hiddleston, gleefully villainous as Loki, one of the most complex and sympathetic baddies in years. Outside of "Star Trek", this is the best big franchise film of the year. Even though Marvel slightly missed the mark with "Iron Man 3", they have returned to solid filmmaking form here through great cartoony graphics, unique superhero cinematography and a solid action movie score. So while it won't win over many new fans for Thor, it will satisfy old ones biding their time until the next Avengers movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A good story told at a measured pace. Not a masterpiece, but probably the only Marvel Studios movie since Iron Man 1 that approaches being a 'great' movie (though its not there yet).A lot of Star Wars imagery, from the design of the ships to the framing of the shots; when the 'Alien Elves' erupt out of that hole thing, it feels like the opening of A New Hope! This could be my favourite Marvel Studios movie after Iron Man 1.I hope Marvel continues in this direction, but let the directors have MORE control, more vision and more passion.A very entertaining blockbuster, but the next one will be better.http://www.comicbooksyndicate.com/thor-the-dark-world/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fun addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Thor: The Dark World is the 8th installment in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. A universe that is an incredible feat in movie-making. Sure, not all the movies have been mind blowing but that doesn't change the fact that what Marvel/Disney is doing is changing movies, more notably the big blockbuster films. They have these intertwined films in a way that we've never really seen before, it's all one big universe?just like a comic book. And I love it. As for this 2nd installment in the Thor franchise, it's pretty good, is it the best of the Marvel Cinematic Universe? No, not really. But, it is certainly an improvement over the 1st film. The movie opens with an opening narration just like the first one about the Dark Elf Malekith who wants to destroy the universe using a weapon named the Aether. This takes place a long time before the days of Odin's rule and involved Odin's father, Bor. Time passes after the Dark Elves have failed and we turn back to Thor in present day. Loki is sent to prison. Thor is lonely but protecting the nine realms. And we have an onslaught of fun action scenes that felt very Lord of the Rings esque which I loved. The Dark Elves are the main villains in this film but they aren't exactly the most interesting which has been a problem in most of the Marvel Cinematic Universe with Loki really being the only standout villain out of all the films, at least in my opinion. There is still plenty of great action pieces especially towards the end which rather than being a big, insane fight is slightly more focused and certainly fun. The humor is there, not in The Avengers doses, but it certainly is still there, especially with Loki and Tom Hiddleston doing a great job.I don't expect to go into these movies and get my life changed or be enlightened in some way. I come to have fun. And I certainly did. Is the movie a bit safe? Yeah, it kind of is, it doesn't try to doing anything crazy or even for the most part, impact the Cinematic Universe a whole lot but it still delivers where it needs to?be entertaining. Overall, I don't think I need to be telling you to see the movie because most of you probably already have?but, these are Event Movies and that's truly what I love the most, these have to be seen in theaters with a large crowd who are excited to see it just as much as you are, that's the way to do it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really liked the Thor comics in the 60's. They had the same limitation of this movie, in that they were somewhat bound one way or another to Asgard (which could be a good thing in a small dose). This movie is not too long, it moves along very well, has a lot of action, is well cast (a strength with all Marvel movies), I think my only major criticism is that it often moves so fast that I never get to either enjoy the moment, or figure out where we are going. Natale Portman is beautiful if looking somewhat anorexic (not the best look for her), Kat Denning works well in occasional comic relief, Hopkins is great as Odin, more of Elba as Heimdall was also welcome. I really really like Huddleston, he is so spot on as Loki it's scary, his deceptive character plays so well against the straight-laced Thor. Looking forward to the next one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really loved the first Thor movie, but my 1 complaint with it was that we didn't get enough Thor, now in this movie Thor was just a complete bad ass for the entire movie, the plot moved fairly fast and was interesting, i found the best scene to be when Thor, Loki and Jane go to Malikith to give him his darkness thing (i forgot what it is called) and Loki made a illusion as if he had turned on Thor by cutting off his hand and pretending to help the elves, but in the end he was still on team Asgard but it cost him his life (but in the end of the film it was revealed that he faked his death so that he could pretend to be Odin because Thor didn't want to be king so in the end Loki would be king, even in a different body), now for my 2 problems with the movie, 1) I felt that malikith was not a threat to Thor in anyway so if he would even try to go face to face with Thor, he wouldn't even stand a chance, now the second problem isn't as big of one, the movie was very funny and they made a lot of jokes, now in the end of the movie they had a big intense scene that primarily took place in London but they still were making jokes and I wish that they could have just taken it a little bit more seriously but still it worked most of the time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Don't get me wrong, I loved the movie and will happily go back to the cinema to get it again but I definitely favour the first movie. It confused me a bit as in the first movie the Bifrost was destroyed? And now its suddenly OK again? Bit of a let down in the fact that I would of liked an explanation on how on earth they'd be able to fix that. Tom Hiddleson definitely done it for me though, I could stare as Chris Hemsworth all day if I could but my eyes were on Hiddleson this time, he is an amazing actor and suits the role of Loki Perfectly. I would of loved to have seen a wee fight between Jane Foster and Lady Sif, you can see them giving each other dirty looks but they do nothing about it? Quite pointless to add that jealousy in if nothing is to be done about it! Amazing special effects though and a lot of violence - the 2 things I love the most! I do recommend it, I just tend to pick out small things that get on my nerves!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thor: The Dark World review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Thor - Norse God of thunder and perhaps one of the most surprising additions to Marvel lore - returns to his fantastic universe that blurs the line between ancient myth and science fiction. Kenneth Branaugh's film has always felt like a "good but not great" affair, so this sequel had nowhere to go but up.Naturally, there are loads of great action scenes throughout the film, with Asgardians, humans, and dark elves fighting on land, sea, air, and space. Among the film's highlights, the elves' raid on Asgard is a fantastic sequence with spaceships zooming around the city with dazzling laser beams and mass destruction. The final act presents a wildly imaginative sequence with characters duking it out across multiple worlds. In between, the film goes through plenty of compelling drama, but a lot of it is ultimately crushed by the comedy; hardly a moment goes by without something funny or ridiculous.The story continues after the first Thor film and The Avengers in a logical manner, continuing the established character arcs. The plot goes through a pretty standard structure, but it is far from predictable; there are a few surprising twists and turns, and the film takes the characters to bold new directions. A lot of the characters are fairly one-dimensional (especially Thor himself, the main antagonist, and the scientist characters, who are there mostly for comic relief), but everybody's favorite supervillain, Loki, easily steals the spotlight. Fortunately, most of these characters are likable (save for Darcy, who I think is cute, but many complain is overbearing). It's largely the villain who comes out as the weakest link, lacking in depth or range.This film pretty standard photography, with some good movements and angles, which let the action scenes flow and speak for themselves. Editing struck me as being a little screwy in a few scenes, but is mostly spot-on. Acting is good: Chris Hemsworth, Tom Hiddleston, and Anthony Hopkins all reprise their roles admirably (Hiddleston has especially grown into his role most comfortably). Natalie Portman continues to play a rather ditzy love interest, but she is given more to do in this film. Everybody else is decent, although I don't think Christopher Eccleston stood out much at all. Writing is not bad, although I felt that the film's explanation of the Aether and its connection with things like dark matter and the universe in general was pretty weak (pretty much technobabble just for the sake of it). This production has decent-looking sets, props, and costumes. Most special effects are cool, but I thought that some of the backgrounds and starfields looked a little low-rez. Music is alright.I find Thor: The Dark World is a grade more enjoyable than the first film, and it's worth seeing to see the characters' progression and plenty of otherworldly action. It's an easy recommendation for fans of the Marvel films.4/5 (Entertainment: Good | Story: Pretty Good | Film: Good)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A different direction for the not a God of Thunder</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Welcome to a review of Thor 2.First, I did enjoy this film, I have seen it twice, with two different groups of people, the first being with a group of friends who are long time Marvel fans, both in the comics and in the movies. The second was with the girlfriend. In both experiences the film was enjoyed by me, but sadly I believe it lacked the quality in direction that was shown in the first film, and it is probably due to the loss of the original director.Yes there is a lot of action in this film, maybe there is technically more in this than in the first film. However, the action from the first film appear to be more memorable as it was correctly paced, with the right balance of humour and action (and plot).The opinion of this was shared by my Marvel die hard friends, but maybe the opinion of my girlfriend is what the balance was aimed for as she absolutely loved it due to the love story between Thor and Jane being a more central pillar of the story this time around.So what can I say about the acting. It was very well acted with Loki definitely once again being the star of the show. Thor was well acted and I have grown to love Hemsworth, but sadly Portman did not seem to want to be in this film and it showed. All the scenes involving her, from the scenes in London to the home world of the Dark Elves just felt wrong. This lack of connection meant I could not root for her and Thor and throughout the film I really did want Malekith just to kill her already and create a new story arc for Thor...hopefully with Lady Sif.The plot was good, not well paced as the original and at some points seemed off. Possibly due to the forced moments of humour inserted but also as if they decided on the plot as they directed the film.**Spoilers** There was no real explanation on why the loss of the Bifrost lead to the rebellion and wars of the Nine Realms, I guess we are just meant to accept it happening. The plot of the Aether plods a long, slowly revealing itself, but we never see why it causes the end of the world, some small explanation of conversion of everything in dark matter. There are also too many unanswered questions as the fate of the Warriors 4 and Lady Sif following their traitorous act.MAJOR SPOILER and sadly the plot surrounding Loki usurping the throne from Odin is not fully explained as how it happened, just a cliffhanger for cliffhanger sake, and this is caused due to the poor editing. So at what point did the Asgardian scout arrive? How did the real Loki manage to stab the Kursed, escape and not get stabbed? As far as I am aware an illusion was meant to be insubstantial.I would regard this as a good film, but considering the standard of Marvel second films I was a little disappointed. Usually Marvel has shown the second to exceed the first. As shown by Spiderman 2, X men 2, Iron Man 2. But sadly this might be the new standard following the slight degradation of the second sequels we have had this year.Note, stay after the trailers, there are 2 end scenes. Sadly there is no Nick Fury this time, which was disappointing, but one scene is for the lovers out there involving Thor and Jane. But this fan is definitely wanting a Thor and Sif storyline.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Probably not as dark as you might think it is, not bad though</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The title of this second instalment of "Thor" may lead spectators to believe this is a dark movie and less humorous than the first one, but that is very far from the truth. Actually this second film is even more comical than the first, for the good or for the bad. I say this because the frequent humour in "The Dark World" bothered some fans while pleased others. As I was watching it I did think some of the comical scenes were a little over the top and others even unnecessary, but generally I very much welcomed the humorous touch. Some of the scenes that put a completely characterized Thor through trivial human situations were very funny. Cameos were also very well used (there's even a special appearance from one of Thor's colleagues from The Avengers). Stan Lee's cameo in this one was one of my favourites from all Marvel films.Another thing that some fans complained about was the motivation (or lack of it) from the villains, the dark elves. Well, it's hard to put in a 2 hour action movie too many explanations without taking the risk of spoiling the pace of the movie. However the explanation in the beginning seemed clear to me, even being quite superficial. I don't read comic books (so I don't have any reference from them), but when the narrator said that dark elves are a race born prior to the birth of light and they want to spread again the dark energy across the universe, their motivation was pretty clear. I mean, unlike humans or asgardians (who were born from light), dark elves were born from dark energy and they simply want that energy taking over light as the moving force in the universe. Dark energy, which is represented in the movie by the alchemical element known as "aether", is considered a natural force in many mythologies and philosophies and is also a widely accepted theory among today's astrophysicists. So asking what is the purpose of the dark elves is the same as asking what is the purpose of dark energy, and that is a philosophical question.The spaceships battle scenes in Asgard were also a point that raised complaints. The movie creators were definitely inspired by Star Wars here, even the spaceships designs are quite similar (X-Wings for the good guys and Tie Fighters for the bad ones). I was not bothered as I saw the movie because I am a big fan of Star Wars (especially the original trilogy), but I understand that crossing fantasy/mythology with science fiction might not please some people, even if this crossing has always been present in Thor. I also have no complaints about CGI or sound effects, I think the movie is technically great (as every other movie produced by Marvel).Lastly, characters and acting. Thor (Chris Hemsworth) and Loki (Tom Hiddlestone) are the movie's stars and they are perfect in their roles. Along with Robert Downey Jr. as Iron Man and Chris Evans as Captain America they are the best casting in The Avengers, in my opinion. I have no criticism to their work. Anthony Hopkins is again excellent as Odin and Rene Russo is just average as Frigga (she certainly does not inspire majesty to me). Stellan Skasgard is again exceptional as Dr. Erik Selvig (crazier than ever) and Cristopher Eccelstone plays a just reasonably evil Malekith (I was much more afraid of the excellent Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje as Algrim). Natalie Portman as Jane Foster does a good job despite her character being a little too bland; she plays much more the "defenceless little girl" type than in the first movie and that was a bit disappointing. The rest of the cast did well as they did in the first movie, some playing comical parts (Kat Dennings) and others more serious ones (Idris Elba). So Thor: The Dark World is one more movie from Marvel Studios that combines action, comedy and science fiction, but with the "bonus" touch of Nordic mythology. If you enjoyed the first one I recommend you to check this sequel.My rating: 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Solid Movie with Lots of Action and Jokes for Every Moviegoers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well First of all I gave 7 star Simply Because The Movie was satisfactory for most cinema-goers.Better than What we have seen this year Though There are some exception.Compare to First movie it was kind of Darky. Dark Colors and Themes become very popular in last couple of year.But First Movie wasn't like that,This time they got the Trend.Quite frankly I am not fan of 3d Marvel Movies But This Movie has Some Action and Comedy even little bit of Romance(in Shakespearean kind).So It is for every moviegoers.Everybody can attach to some part of the Movie.Also acting was mostly solid,CGI was stunning like most of Marvel super hero movies.Only Con I had notice was it has some major plot holes.But it isn't big deal As long as You aren't hoping to see Smthg like "Apocalypse Now" or "Shawshank Redemption".All in All It has some funny jokes and Lots of Action If You wanna see a movie to have a good time with your friends,Then Thats the movie You should see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Better than the first film in my opinion and simply a great sequel. The stakes were higher. The characters were mostly brilliant though I felt Malekith could have been developed slightly more. Loki was simply wonder and maybe the class of the entire effort. I loved the plot and the balance of action and story. That's where this film excels over the original. There's heart and humor but far better action and far more dire consequences.Honestly, If you're going to turn a comic book into a movie, do it with utter belief in your story and do it with the best talent and FX possible. That's why Marvel movies do so well and why they need to get ALL their properties back under their roof. We'd all love to see the Marvel Universe united if it's all to be done this well. Not looking ahead, just enjoy this movie for the wonderful spectacle and story that it delivers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Much better than the first one</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Saw this last night and really enjoyed it, and here are 4 reasons why:1) Asgard didn't look as plasticy this time which was something that bugged me in the first movie. 2) Hemsworth seemed more comfortable in the role. He got the balance about right I thought - although possibly a little soft and not berserker enough.3) Loki stood out for me as well played character. Subtle and solid. 4) Humour was well placed and a fun watch. Sometimes the one liners felt like one liners (didn't always mesh well with what was happening... but were still usually funny.Much stronger effort than the first Thor movie and one I will watch again. As usual stay until the end of the credits.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Thor: the dark world is far far far better than the first movie for me... and a greater adaptation than its predecessor.In the first movie, all i saw was a spoiled, arrogant, barbaric prince from a realm unknown to us earthlings. He did nothing but irritate me and wasted enough of my brain cells and time. :lBut, HEY!!!! in the second movie, oh my! there is substance in every speech that the characters give. My! My! Also, Thor is not a spoiled barbaric prince anymore. He uses his mind this time. There's also more depth between the interaction of him with his brother, loki. Though betrayal and hate separated them, i was astonished how they came to terms with their differences and emotions for their departed mother. As always, CGI is good. Better character development for the protagonists. The story have more substance and was more logical. humor decreased but rarity makes the humor funnier. lol i love loki's character more... :D tom hiddleston was perfect for that part. if it's so good.. why did i give an 8?I love christopher eccleston but i think his character, malekith was taken for granted by the writers so this movie can have a villain... it's like saying "oh well.. you're just gonna die in the end so i will not put much thought into your character" another reason was the questions that popped up in my mind... i thought they were going to hide the aether where no one can find it? they should've placed a guardian in that place if it's really dangerous. lol how lucky was jane that she's the one to find the hidden aether?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A lighthearted Rehash.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The blithe and action-filled sequel to the solid and surprisingly interesting "Thor" from 2011, never quite unfolds the necessary emotional depth that would make you truly care for the characters as there is no character development like in the first part where the all shiny thunder god Thor made a remarkable transformation from an arrogant bully into a responsible hero whereas now he appears to be a rather one-dimensional beau who is good for some stunning stunts and few cool lines; with his roguish brother Loki as a welcome exception since his ambiguous motives have a sort of lurking sensation to them even though he is slowly turning into a Roly-Poly doll whose tricks are getting old.The rag rug of a plot is too unoriginal and therefore too predictable to be really suspenseful in spite of some more or less contrived twists. It's the ever same "Capture the Flag"-formula, where the hero needs to wrest a "Holy Grail"-like magical stone from the enemy's greedy claws in order to save the world, that we have not just recently seen in too many movies before; whether it's called "Tesseract", "Allspark" or like in this case "Aether", it may be a somewhat necessary plot device that brings forward the action, however, if it remains like here the only impetus, the only sense without a deeper meaning, without a humane message, then it is too little and trite to have a lasting impact. Nowadays, every episode of "Game of Thrones" offers much more excitement and drama than many a Blockbuster I've seen in recent years.What's missing plot-wise is compensated with great visuals and nearly breathtaking action sequences that come along as a Star Wars meets Lord of the Rings meets Viking mythology crossover fantasy/science-fiction mash-up which is definitely a plus. The invasion of Asgaard by the Dark Elves strongly resembles the great Battle on Naboo in "Star Wars: Episode I" especially since Bambi-eyed Nathalie Portman plays the dame in distress in both movies. The chemistry between her role Jane Foster and Thor is good although their kisses lack the fiery passion we saw in Spiderman for example; much more touching love stories have been told than this one for sure."Thor: The Dark Kingdom" is at least nice to look at.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thor: The Dark World</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first Thor film based on the popular Marvel comics, directed by Kenneth Branagh, was a good watch, and I was looking forward to seeing this sequel, not just because it looked really good, but it was also a continuation and crossover of the Avengers Assemble plot. Basically thousands of years ago Bor (Tony Curran), the father of Odin (Sir Anthony Hopkins), fought in the great war between the Dark Elf Malekith (Christopher Eccleston) who wants to destroy the universe with the weapon called the Aether, they are defeated, the Aether is hidden somewhere in a stone column, and while imprisoned Malekith, his lieutenant Algrim (Lost's Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje) and other Dark Elves escape in suspended animation. In the present day on Asgard, Loki (Tom Hiddleston) is being imprisoned for his war crimes on Earth, there is a possibility that Thor (Chris Hemsworth) will take over the throne from his father Odin, meanwhile on Earth in London astrophysicist Dr. Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) and her former intern Darcy Lewis (Kat Dennings), who herself has intern Ian Boothby (Jonathan Howard), are investigating unearthly things. In abandoned warehouse Jane, Darcy and Ian find an invisible portal that makes things disappear into thin air, sometimes coming back and going through again, sometimes not, then all of the sudden Jane is teleported to another world, and there she finds the stone containing the Aether, which infects her, and she returns to Earth unaware of what has happened. Back in Asgard a rare alignment of the Nine Realms is imminent, it also means portals to the other worlds appear at random, Thor is told by Heimdall (Idris Elba) that Jane disappeared, he goes to Earth to see she is safe, he takes her to his home world to see healers, they do not know how to treat her, Odin warns that the infection of the Aether will eventually kill her, and that its return means a prophecised catastrophe. The Aether release has awakened Malekith, and he and his group make an attack Asgard, and during the battle Thor and Loki's mother Frigga (Rene Russo) is killed, Odin orders Thor to do nothing, but against his father's wishes he releases his malevolent brother, as he knows Malekith's secret portal, they will attempt to use Jane to lure and confront him, and he makes a deal that Loki can have revenge for the death of their mother. Volstagg (Ray Stevenson), Sif (Jaimie Alexander) and Fandral (Zachary Levi) assist their getaway and escape from the Asgardian soldiers, they commandeer a Dark Elf spaceship and with Jane transport to Svartalfheim, once there they eventually find Malekith, Loki tricks him into removing the Aether from inside Jane and absorb it himself, Thor fails to destroy it before it enters the enemy's body, and Loki appears mortally wounded in a short fight, before he apparently dies Thor promises his brother he will tell of his sacrifice. Thor and Jane find another portal, the same that took her from Earth to the stone, so they teleport back to Earth and reunite with Darcy, Ian and Jane's mentor Dr. Erik Selvig (Stellan Skarsg?rd), who recently came out from an institution following a breakdown after the New York attacks, they work out that Melekith will attempt to destroy the universe in the centre of the Convergence, in Greenwich. The Dark Elves spaceship crashes through the city square, and Malekith and Thor battle going though the various portals, Thor's hammer going back and forth to find him, finally Malekith is transported to Svartalfheim before he can destroy the universe, the spaceship collapsing to the ground is transported too, and he is killed crushed by it, the Earth is safe. In the end Thor is asked by Odin to take his place as king of Asgard, he declines and tells of Loki's sacrifice, and when he walks away Odin turn out to be the living Loki in disguise, and in the mid- credits a villain called The Collector (Benicio Del Toro) is given the Aether by Volstagg and Sif to look after, it is obvious from his final words that he has other things to collect for an evil plot. Also starring Tadanobu Asano as Hogun, Clive Russell as Tyr, Chris O'Dowd as Richard, Chris Evans as Captain America, Talulah Riley as Nurse, Alice Krige as Eir Stan Lee as Patient. Hemsworth once again is great as the strong willed and heroic warrior, Portman is still sweet as the hero's love interest, Ecceleston is almost unrecognisable with his deep voice and makeup and makes a menacing presence, Hiddleston is still lovably malevolent and snide with his quips, and Hopkins in his time brings his usual good seriousness. The story is a little technological and bolder than the previous fantasy film, with much more being destroyed and many more battles on Earth and in outer space, so plenty of great special effects to create the spectacle, its interesting to see it going on in Great Britain in an American made film, and you feel the doom and gloom moments too, all this combines to make a much better than the first, highly entertaining and exciting action adventure film. Very good!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thor: The Dark World</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Marvel sure know how to up their game. This sequel is one such example. I wasn't familiar with Thor but after viewing the first film, I decided to view the second, after a university class, and I really enjoyed the film. The Marvel Cinematic Universe just keeps getting better with every film and I cannot wait for more! Best parts...* Chris Evans cameo - This was a surprising cameo as Tom Hiddleston was acting just like Chris Evans and I mean speaking exactly like Chris Evans!. Everyone in the cinema enjoyed this cameo and they, along with me, were clapping for this magnificent scene.* Filmed in London. - It was a great decision to film in London as the previous films were more or less situated in America. Different locations are good and I like diversity.* The music played during the funeral of Frigga was a standout for me as it was emotional as everyone in the realm of Asgard were sad to see the demise of a much loved Queen and mentor. It was such a beautiful scene and the music gets to you as it was perfect. * I felt really sorry for Loki when he was told by an Asgardian guard about the demise of Queen Frigga. Despite everything that happened in the first Thor film and Avengers, he really loved his foster mum and it was shown when he got up and released his rage by blasting everything in the prison with his fists clenched. * Sir Anthony Hopkins once again shows that he was the right actor chosen to portray Odin. Sentencing Loki with authority at the beginning of the film and exiling Thor in the first film were defining moments by an actor I truly admire.* Bringing Kat Dennings back as Darcy was a master stroke as her timely comedy lines and actions balanced the action scenes as well as the heart-wrenching scenes such as the death of Frigga and the apparent demise of Loki. I love the witty personality of Kat Dennings. * Natalie Portman...What can I say?! I absolutely love everything about her life!!! She has such a bubbly personality and is definitely cute. As for her performance in Thor 2, I loved it! I hope she will be in third film and have a part in Avengers 2. If Thor and Jane Foster go their separate ways in Avengers 2, I will never forgive Marvel for this action as I truly admire and love Natalie Portman.Overall, I enjoyed the film and I rate the film 10/10. Performances by everyone were phenomenal. I can't wait for Captain America: The Winter Soldier.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This will get even more interesting when we get the next sequel.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Out of everything in the Marvel Universe, when it comes to paper (comics), Thor is about the dumbest character. He will always look like the California surfer guy smoking the second hand smoke. He's a character that is supposed to fit into Norse mythology but I don't see much of that in him whatsoever. Unlike someone like Batman or Spider Man, this character has only one weapon and that is a hammer and this is cheesy.That said though, Thor still has a lot of potential. The character is different every which way. Also Norse mythology is a very uncommon thing in the comic book world and also in the film world and this shows originality. Thor is also a character with an interesting history that breaks many norms and no doubt the series has an audience.After an impressive run at the box office with the first feature film, Thor: The Dark World is the sequel. The plot has Thor (Chris Hemworth) fighting Malekith ( Christopher Eccleston) who is a villain that is trying to destroy this world by making it darker using the weapon called Aether.Like the 2011 film, the cast here is a hit. Chris Hemsworth is the likable Thor who again brings a sarcastic tone. Jane Foster (Natalie Portman ) is Thor's love interest and is a character that goes with the flow and who along with Darcy (Kat Dennings) brings more humor than the first movie which was unexpected. After what he did in The Avengers, (Tom Hiddleston) Loki is the character we are most looking forward to seeing. Here Middleston plays Loki, Thor's brother, as the same type of character as before. Loki is silly and an un-credited villain though ironically he ends up being on the good side here. Odin (Anthony Hopkins) is the humble father who is trying to keep the peace between the brothers and also outsiders.This being a superhero film, the next biggest question that comes up is just what does the villain bring to the film. Even with the tired concept of trying to take over the world again, Malekith is the villain we want. With different makeup and being a dark character, the weapon of Aether brings a different element to the table. It's also not that hard to follow the story like some other superhero films plots that we have had in the last couple of years. Unlike the first movie, there is a big ending here presented in a joking matter that feels like something out of a David Lynch movie. There are so many turns in the third act and final scenes that it creates a lot of discussion coming out of the theater. Still though, it sets the Thor series up for what seems like an interesting sequel and it also shows that director Alan Taylor is willing to make some very risky moves. Call it a mixed ending at best.After the story, the next interesting side of Thor is the main world Asgard which is full of interesting colors, lights and tones. Nothing in the Marvel Universe really comes close to Asgard. As with the 2011 film, the part of the sequel in Asgard is a little thing of the film but it goes a long way and something I would enjoy seeing many more times.It is probably something we don't need but Thor: Dark World is still none the less a very solid sequel. It is so good of a sequel it shows that something of this depth can work again. This will get even more interesting when we get the next sequel.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another great movie in 2013</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In my personal opinion 2013 has been full of great movies such as Iron Man Star Trek and Man of Steel just to name a few. Im really happy to be able to say I can now add yet another movie to the list. Thor the Dark World was every bit as awesome as I'd hoped it would be. The story of the MCU was furthered along as well as the story of the stand alone character Thor.I loved seeing Loki once again doing what he does I loved seeing Thor evolve more as a character and I also loved seeing Thor taken from a more sci fi approach.Its great seeing these big characters being worked into a story grounded in reality but since most of this movie didn't take place on Earth they were able to take a more futuristic like approach to realistic then they have before.Overall I don't really have a whole lot to say other then that Thor the Dark World is a great entry in the MCU I give Thor the Dark World a 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Thor 2 - The Dark World , I believe is the best Marvel movie of the year. Popular avenger Iron 3 really had a very bad impact on fans like me but thanks to the crew for pulling up socks and making "my favorite superhero" movie this good. Well, I cannot simple say its a flawless film but it emerges our expectations in a good way. Attractive Asgard is a beautiful realm made, and the special / visual effects in the movie are possibly the award winning feature. Good mixture of comedy and drama. Thor with his usual knack humor has done extremely well (*phew* there was lot of hype on Loki). THOR! WOW! The character is perfectly drawn, his strength is depicted very well from the comic Thor. Plus Hemsworth is perfect for the character and I believed it since previous Thor. Little ambiguities in terms of story line especially Jane getting affected by the Aether as if it was simply made to make sure Thor will have a girlfriend beside her, but thanks to Natalie, she gives justice to the character. "Another" - Thor missed saying it though. *giggles*</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Marvel takes a full-on sci-fi/fantasy approach with 'Dark World'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Most moviegoers probably didn't realize Thor was a comic book character in the Marvel universe before his big-screen debut in 2011. Flash forward just two and a half years later and Chris Hemsworth has portrayed the Norse god of thunder three times already. "Thor: The Dark World" looks to continue riding the post-"Avengers" wave, but Avengers cameos and S.H.I.E.L.D references aside, it's not what most audiences have come to know as a superhero movie.This won't matter for the target audience of "Thor: The Dark World." I count myself among the many who get giddy over mentions of realms, Dark Elves and powerful Aether. These, however, are the hallmarks of sci fi/fantasy. So, let the record state that "The Dark World" falls most definitively in that category, because if that doesn't excite you, "The Dark World" most likely won't.Marvel Studios hasn't misfired since "Iron Man 2," which ? all superhero films ever considered ? wasn't that much of a misfire. Thor's second solo outing more or less measures similarly to Iron Man's. The movie just doesn't have much going for it besides its geek-tastic charms, a charismatic leading man and one of the most complex and lovable villains in Loki (Tom Hiddleston).Anything that opens with a scene explaining a battle that happened long ago in which a villain and an evil power were thought to be sealed away forever better be "The Fellowship of the Ring," otherwise it belongs in a video game. Unfortunately, that's the sour note "The Dark World" begins on, explaining how Malekith (Christopher Eccleston) and the Dark Elves of Svartalfheim tried to use a powerful dark matter called Aether to cast the nine realms in darkness exactly 5,000 years ago, the last time all nine realms aligned. Of course, such things happen every 5,000 years, and when Thor's love, Jane Foster (Natalie Portman), happens upon the Aether, Malekith awakens to take his vengeance."Thor: The Dark World" shares a lot of characteristics with "Star Trek," jumping between realms as "Star Trek" does planets, introducing new species with cool spaceships and cooler weapons. Asgard comes to life with the same aesthetic that original "Thor" director Kenneth Branagh and the Marvel Studios creative team dreamed up a few years ago, but "Dark World" director Alan Taylor ("Game of Thrones") gets to play around in it. The film is almost unapologetic in the way it splashes around in sci-fi/fantasy hallmarks, and Taylor's fight sequences are a significant improvement from the first "Thor" in terms of style.Taylor was also a decent pick in terms of familial tensions in fantasy. The Thor-Loki dynamic was a highlight in the first film, and given that Loki caused all the mischief in "The Avengers," it's twice as interesting watching Hiddleston and Hemsworth together. Hiddleston in particular continues to step even deeper into the role in this film, though Loki is mostly relegated to a subplot except for the film's most exciting sequence, when Thor and the Warriors Three enlist his help to try and trick Malekith. The script takes full advantage of his trickster powers, but also creates an intriguing character arc for him. It's hard to say if it's the writing and Hiddleston that make Loki a huge highlight of "The Dark World," or the notion of his subplot also serving as a continuation of what happened in "The Avengers" and a precursor to what will come in "The Avengers: Age of Ultron." Either way, "The Dark World" has significantly more of a post-"Avengers" component than "Iron Man 3" did. The script also shares the same sense of humor that gave the first "Thor" its charm. Hemsworth is such a presence that when he gets to deliver a subtle a joke it has an ironic twist to it that works every time. The humor revolving around the human characters, however, such as Kat Dennings (who needs to not appear in these films ever again ? she isn't going to be the deciding factor for teenage girls thinking of buying tickets), tends to be corny. Predictably, Portman is a wasted talent yet again as Foster is further reduced to a damsel in distress fawning over Thor despite his tendency to run off to other realms and leave her for extended periods of time.Given Marvel Studios' pedigree, it's fair to call "Thor: The Dark World" underwhelming. Plenty to look at, laugh at and geek out over, but a film that will ultimately be seen as a gap-filler between two epic "Avengers" films. That's okay for Thor, because you don't necessarily have to give grounding to a fantastical character from such a strange universe, but some effort to make the film a bit suspenseful and prove a trial for the main characters might've helped stave off our wild anticipation for May 2015.~Steven CThanks for reading!

		<fullReview>Just got back from the theater. Thor: The Dark World is an INCREDIBLE visual experience to go along with excellent action, drama and humor. The plot concerns the Dark Elves, a force from the distant past, trying to sweep aside all light in the universe, transforming it into a "Dark World." The special effects are much better than in the original Thor, where I found them a bit wanting. The visuals, the battles, the action sequences all made me think: "This is what the Star Wars prequel should have been." All the characters are back in all their glory. Thor is the mature hero, Loki is back for plenty of wisecracks and Anthony Hopkins gives a consistently excellent performance as Odin. There is pathos and feeling which peak in an AMAZING funeral sequence for a dead character that is a must see. There were many times that I shook my head in amazement at the spectacle I witnessed, dumbstruck over the creative talents of the people involved. I enjoyed this much more than the original Thor, which was a pretty good film in it's own right. Go see it!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have never been into superhero movies like this and would have never imagined that I would enjoy them. My husband wanted to see this movie so we went to the first opening on Thursday night. I have to say that I loved it. I didn't expect to and I was trying not to. The one thing that I found to be the most interesting is the dynamic between Thor and Loki. I loved the complicated brother relationship aspect. I think that Chris Hemsworth and Natalie Portman were good in this movie but the best was Tom Hiddleston. I don't believe that I have seen a movie with him in it. But he was truly the most interesting and believable character. He was the reason I wanted to continue to watching the movie. I kept wondering if he'd betray Thor or if he'd be an honest brother to him. All I have to say is that the ending is the best. It'll make you think "I really didn't see that coming." Well, some people might see it coming; however, if you are completely unaware of comic book stuff like me, you will be surprised. Anyways, I was surprised I liked it and Loki stole the show.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The best things about this type of movie is their looks and the right action/tone. "The Avengers" did an amazing job last year, finally getting us in the right groove. The first "Thor" introduced us to an amazing looking world, and it had enough humor to keep it going, but it needed something else, a more defined villain. Then came Loki, and he is on his way to greatness.A more powerful enemy is threatening the entire universe, making the conflict personal as even family members become targets and apparently nothing is spared. The last time we saw Loki he had been captured and was now a life prisoner, but circumstances demand that Thor join forces with him, risking betrayal at any time, but the alternative is annihilation.There is more humor in this movie, and definitely more darkness, destruction, and death, and the plot twists are more interesting than in the first one. Apparently, practice does get you on your way to perfection. So be prepared to be surprised pleasantly, even though you will, as it has become custom, be yearning for a couple of years to go by so you can see what the next adventure will be like.In the meantime, let your imagination go wild as Thor must reluctantly join forces with Loki, who has a couple of surprises up his sleeve, and be ready to meet some new faces that will most likely give us some entertaining moments in years to come. Here is a hero worth of a sequel, and so is a villain who, like wine, improves with age.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thor is very much an action/ comedy but, like most Marvel films, it has a sense of interdependency in which the hero is nothing without their allies.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me start off right the bat saying I wasn't originally going to see this movie. This is despite me loving Marvel franchises like X-Men and Spiderman, but for whatever reason those who comprise the Avengers just never screamed, "see me opening weekend!" for reasons I don't understand. Still, for the sake of getting out the house I saw this and was sort of surprised by the end result.Characters &amp; StoryAs many know, Thor (played by Chris Hemsworth) is the god of thunder and the hero of the film. Alongside him is his love interest Jane (played by Natalie Portman) who is an astrophysicist who, like most love interest, act as much as a liability as an asset; then we have the scene commanding Loki (played by Tom Hiddleston) who often is the most interesting character in the film since he has good action scenes, comedic moments, and brings many questions to the story; then there is the last big character of the film, to me anyway, the villain Malakith (played by Christopher Exxleston) who is sort of your generic villain hell-bent on destroying the world, without any unique traits to make him stand out amongst the many villains of the Marvel universe. Outside of those mentioned, there is Odin (played by Anthony Hopkins) who is Thor's father and king of Asgard; Heimdall (played by Idris Elba) who seems to be the watcher of the various realms Asgard rules over; and then there is Darcy (played by Kat Dennings) who I only mention since she and Loki brings the majority of the laughs in the film.Now, in terms of story, they first establish, especially for people like me, the power and might of Thor as he tries to unite all the realms. Then, and this is not in exact order, we watch Jane try to move on from Thor, and do research, which leads her to discovering something called "The Aether" a magic mist which has the power to return the world to darkness, the way it was assumingly before the big bang. Her discovery of this magic awakens Malekith and leads Thor to bringing her to Asgard to be protected but, being that this movie has to fill nearly two hours, naturally they beat the hell out of Thor and Asgard, and then bring in Loki to help get revenge. From there, things are taken to Earth and then the final battle goes back and forth between Earth and The Dark World.PraiseSomething you'll find in 90% of all Marvel films, and most comic book adaptations nowadays, is there is a mix of comedy, drama and some comedic moments. For Thor: The Dark World, they do a tightrope balance of all three and do so with the type of skill which seems almost unnatural. The reason I say that is I haven't seen the first, but watching this made me feel like I was watching an action/ comedy which easily could slip into dramedy, and then back. The comedy itself though was a real highlight for Loki and Darcy made it so those maybe not into the action of Thor story got a few laughs, and then the action had mutilations, epic scenery and sometimes I felt I was watching a Dragon Ball Z crossover. Perhaps though the best thing was the writing when it came to Loki. Needless to say, as much as this film made Hemsworth the star amongst his brothers, Hiddleston is the true breakout star in my opinion, and the movie takes full advantage of his talents. Be it his comedic moments, dramatic moments, or the air of mystery they put in what happens to him, you are left with questions which perhaps can only be answered in another sequel.CriticismWhich leads to the handful of criticism that can be given to this movie, of which there is very few. Perhaps the one big criticism is the villain has no personality and though he does something which involves killing a major character, at the same time you can understand why other franchises like X-Men and Spiderman came before Thor since based off this villain alone, it makes it seem like you have this great hero, but no formidable opponents to really challenge him. Then, I must admit that while I liked the action scenes, I did feel the comedy took away a bit from the some of the scenes. For, even in the final fight, they take a comedic break and then the action goes on once more. It makes it so, for me, it seems like they were trying to make the film so universally likable, they took away from what perhaps is the main selling point.Overall: Worth SeeingI'll admit, after seeing this I do wanna see the first, even if just for Loki. For, this film may not be on the iconic status like The Dark Knight, but it sets out to entertain you and does just that. Then, as an added bonus, it has some diversity. There are villains and heroes which are a good mix of people of color and different genders, and the mere view of the worlds they live in is awe-inspiring. Lastly, I must mention there are two post credit scenes. One which is worth waiting for, and the very last one, at the end of all the cast and crew, which isn't a big deal.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>THOR 2 enters my ALL TIME FAVORITE list</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The second installment of the saga of the God of Thunder is rocking awesome!!! I haven't had so much fun in a movie theater since THE LORD OF THE RINGS. It's that good. The Hobbit on the other hand isn't near close. Thor is nothing like the other Marvel movies about super heroes. This one is a totally different animal. It is up there with the big boys-Star Wars, Star Trek and The Lord of The Rings. I could tell that the movie crew spent a good amount of time to make it right. This is not a fast production for easy cash ins. This one is The Real Deal-A True Movie Magic! I was a bit afraid that the second one is not going to match the quality of the first one. I mean how do you top the scene where Thor is being cast out of Asgard by his father Odin. The level of acting delivered by Anthony Hopkins was just awe inspiring! Well, the second one has few of those scenes and it just keeps delivering. How long has it been since I wanted to see a movie over again. Thor and Thor 2-Tthe Dark World are an instant classic and as I love to say: Do yourselves a favor and see those two movies! I recommend regular projection over 3d screening since the film was originally shot in 2d and was meant to be viewed in 2d. It is cheaper too. Actually if you go to a morning projection in any theater you will pay close to nothing. I payed only $6.00! If you don't want to pay that you can always rent it off of the RED BOX kiosks for a dollar and some cents(the movie will take a few months to be available to rent). Always pick the blu-ray over DVD for richer colors, greater resolution, crisp details, supreme audio quality and that cinema feel that is bigger than life.I want you to know that my review is totally independent. I am not paid by any company for my reviews and will never let myself be paid to deliver a review. I am a regular citizen that enjoys watching movies and I stand behind all of my reviews.

		<fullReview>Those words were uttered quite often by myself (also to myself) as I walked home from the theatres after watching Thor: The Dark World. The story makes little to no sense and incorporates all the tropes one would expect: the monster of the week (Dark Elves this time around, the Frost Giants seem to be a distant memory), some enemies become friends and Chris Hemsworth takes of his shirt.However, even though I've never been a fan of 'accepting something for what it is', that is exactly what this movie forces you to do. It doesn't attempt to make any sense, nor does it even slightly attempt to take itself seriously. I think the last time I laughed out loud so much during a movie was watching Forgetting Sarah Marshall, and that says a lot.This movie truly is a stellar example of an action comedy, but could benefit greatly from a slightly more coherent plot. All in all though - well worth the watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie rocks. Everything is in complete synchronization with the plot. i watched this movie twice and i am still looking forward to watch it again. Chris Hemsworth is excellent as usual but Tom Hiddleston has done more than excellent work in this movie as Loki. His character, acting and dialogues are exactly what we want to see. it is like having Heath Ledger from The Dark Knight as the Joker.others to look forward to are Natalie Portman, Anthony Hopkins and Christopher Eccleston. this movie is darker than all the marvel phase-1 movies and is a lot better than it's predecessor. Loki is the best thing that happened to this movie. if Loki was not in the movie, i would have rated it 8/10. The second half is clearly better than the first half. But the first half consists of some excellent scenes like Frigga's funeral which are beautifully shot and create magic. The final battle is packed with action and a much anticipated kiss between Darcy and Ian. Stellan Skarsg?rd as Erik Selig adds up humour in the film side-by-side with Loki disguising as captain America. this movie makes up for enjoyable watching.Thor'ough Enjoyment</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Finally we get to see the full power of Thor unleashed! But what really made this movie great was Tom Hiddleston as Loki, and Christopher Ecclestion as Malekith. Both were great villains, and I loved the way Loki played off of Thor. I also loved seeing Thor and Malekith duke it out in the final fight as well. Seeing more Idris Elba is always a plus. I just wish they would have spent less time on Midgard. Other than that, easily the second-best MCU movie. Make sure you stay for a crazy reveal in the last scene, as well as an mid-credit scene that has huge implications for the entire Marvel Cinematic Universe! 10/10</fullReview>

Hang on to your seats people because the mischievous Loki is at it again. At least this time his ways may have changed just a little but not by that much. Just go see the movie and stop reading the reviews. Believe me, this wouldn't have been a number one movie if it wasn't worth watching. I even rated it ten out of ten because it was that good.

		<fullReview>Just watched this with my movie theatre-working friend. In my review of the previous Thor movie, I mentioned I fell asleep during some of it but managed to wake up during the really exciting parts. This time, I was alert the whole time and me and my friend were really into it this time! Thor and his evil brother Loki and mortal Jane Foster are back and better than ever! Oh, and I also was highly amused by Kat Dennings as Darcy. This was exciting enough from beginning to end with spectacular sequences during the last 40 minutes. I don't really feel like mentioning the plot, just watch this if you love Marvel Comics lore. And, oh, if you watch the new series "Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D", this movie is a tie-in to tonight's episode so that's a high recommendation to see Thor: The Dark World.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than the first!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm a huge comic book geek and have been loving this undertaking that Marvel Studios has taken with their shared cinematic universe. I thought it couldn't get any better than "The Avengers" but the Phase II films were set up with a terrific, introspective and surprising film in the shape of "Iron Man 3" and now "Thor: The Dark World" comes in and continues an epic build up to the next Avengers film.I actually believe this film was better than Thor's first movie (and I LOVED that one!) because we get to see a film that simultaneously has a larger, galactic focus but is still personal as it develops Thor and Jane's love and Thor and Loki's bitter sibling rivalry. Not to mention we also get a villain that is able to fill in Loki's shoes as the antagonist perfectly. While Malekith may not be a recognizable name to non-comic fans, Christopher Eccleston really brought the character to life and made him chilling and foreboding.Finally, the special effects are fantastic, we get to see more of Asgard than we did in the first film, the make-up effects were just absolutely stunning, the action is intense and exciting and the movie is very, very funny! Plus, we get to see more of Heimdell and whenever you get more Idris Elba in a film, you win! "Thor: The Dark World" really felt like a comic book come to life and is how a comic adaptation should be. It's just plain fun, action packed and filled with larger-than-life characters.Hi! My name is Rev. Ron and I love movies! So much so that I have a blog where I review every movie I am currently watching.

THOR 2 is way better than the first one. Chris Hemsworth is much more comfortable in the role. The visual effects are fantastic.I actually got the subtle homage(probably not intended) to Dr Who since Chris Eccleston was Dr Who once after all.I expected to be surprised, and was.

		<fullReview>When I saw the 1st part of Thor, I didn't have much knowledge of Greek mythology and I thought, since it was building up for a much bigger film(the Avengers), I liked it pretty much though it was like just another superhero film.Now that we have already seen The Avengers and also Ironman3, we know how big the things are going. And MARVEL does nothing wrong while bringing out this new Thor movie. It has all the fine elements of a MARVEL film. Comedy,suspense,action and also a surprise cameo(I'll say no more).This movie's story focuses on the power of Aether which was hidden from Black Elves by Odin's father. Then the story goes on about how Thor stops it from reaching the hands of evil Malekith when the Aether re-surfaces. The best part in the movie is the wry humour, the action of course and a little sentimental touch. And Loki also has a very interesting role in this one. The earth part adds a bit of scientific element to the mythology, thereby making it a complete package.MARVEL's bringing more and more great films with The Avengers franchise and also a good TV series (Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D), so we fans are definitely not going to miss this one. And for those who haven't started with this, I advice you people to get MARVEL'D.</fullReview>

But an old enemy from Odin's past wants what is in Jane's system, and he will stop at nothing to get it.A pretty good Marvel film, although I do miss some of the Shakespearing elements from the first one, but the effects and scenery are incredible, I feel where inspired off of Lord Of The Rings and Star Wars. Chris Hemsworth is still great as Thor, Natalie Portman and Idris Elba are giving more to do the second time around. This makes me excited for the second Avengers film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Thor has come back to earth, and other realms once more for a action packed joy ride that will leave you wanting the next film. I must say that I was a slight bit skeptical when I found that Kenneth Brannagh was not directing this film, and in the end the movie didn't have the same twist of the first one. I will say that i enjoyed Thor The Dark World just as much, or better then the first movie, even without the flow of the first movie. All I can say is they left a little bit to be desired with the villain, and the movie was way to short. The acting was fantastic on everyone's part, and it was a great movie. Join Thor and Loki as they travel between worlds, in an epic battle between good and evil. The question is, do they make it out unharmed and avoiding death? Watch the movie and you will find out.I will leave it at that for this review, because if I went on forever, I might give away the whole plot.I hope you enjoy the movie, and have a nice day.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really enjoyed this movie and in some respects feel it was even better than the first. The storyline and characters are much more developed so you a better sense of the life of Thor. You also see that Loki has true heart felt feelings for his mother and brother which is not seen in Thor 1 or the Avengers. I laughed several times during the movie which was great considering the heavy subject line.The only drawback to the movie is the overly "comic book" and "superhero" feel to the story. There is the token "helpless woman" who the hot superhero is working to save. This is way over played in superhero movies these days so I cannot deduct rating stars for Thor following this "guideline". Definitely a must see movie for all action-adventure movie fans!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Extremely enjoyable. Grandoise vision. Impeccable execution</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a long time fan of comic books, and have really enjoyed Hollywood's current craze with them. Over the past few years, Marvel has reinvented large scale movie spectacles, infusing action and wit with science fiction and fantasy with great effectiveness, and earning top dollar for it. They have hit the bull's-eye again with Thor- The Dark World. As a sequel it belong to a hallowed club- it betters 2011's Thor in every conceivable way- better acting, better plot, better action and way better humor making for one thrilling experience.The story is standard superhero stuff- there is a catastrophic power. Dark forces once wielded it, good guys hid it, somehow it surfaces, dark forces want to reclaim it, and it is time again for the good guys to stand up again to ensure it does not happen. After a lengthy prologue that tell us about events that predates the creation of the universe as we know it, the movie picks up right after the New York invasion in the Avengers. Loki is in Asgard as a prisoner, and Thor and Jane Foster are united again, but only after Jane accidentally stumbles into another dimension and embodies an ancient dark power- the Aether. The dark elf Malekith wants to possess it to, well, turn all universe into darkness. After Asgard is invaded, and the only thing that both Thor and Loki loved is taken away from them, an uneasy alliance between the two remains the only thing that can stop the destruction of the universe. All in all, a premise that requires a lot of popcorn to digest."I wish i could trust you"- Thor "Trust my rage"- LokiShoehorning Norse mythology into science fiction is a crazy idea, right? But what execution here. The production values are impeccable, kind of leave The Avengers far behind, even though extensively shot in Marvel's version of Asgard which is an imaginative living, breathing world. Game of Thrones director Alan Taylor is at the helm here, and the mega bucks at his disposal come off strongly. The pace is snappy, there is never a dull moment due to frequent action and the infectious humor- Kat Dennings, Chris O'Dowd, Tom Hiddleston, Stellan Skaarsgaard gets guffaw inducing lines. This is as much Liam Hemsworth's movie as it is Tom Hiddlestons'. If Thor is called as the witless oaf who would punch his way out of a situation, Loki is irresistible as the snarky, duplicitous, conflicted, whimsical trickster, an anti-hero that today's Breaking Bad generation would love to bits. Loki shifts from black to white to grey, and grey is what he will remain in the Marvel universe henceforth- choosing sides that benefit him. And in between comes in Chris Evans in a scene stealing cameo as Captain America lampooning himself ("I can feel the righteousness flowing through me!")It is true that we in India do not have a comic book culture, and the lack of quality source material is evident. A week back we had Krrish 3, which was ambitious no doubt but came out horribly clichéd. Thor-The Dark World is a 2 hour lesson for Rajesh Roshan on how to tell a wacky story that actually captivates the audience. It is goofy, has numerous plot holes but by God i had a great time watching it. Dazzling action, tons of humor (this is the third time i have mentioned the word in the review, i know!), charismatic actors and likable characters- this is the Marvel billion dollar formula and it is at full display here, audiences rejoice. Definitely recommended- 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Pretty Satisfying Sequel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Taking place after the events of The Avengers, Thor (Chris Hemsworth) has returned to Asgard to assume his path of becoming king. But when he learns that his true love Jane (Natalie Portman) has been afflicted by a dark force, and a dark lord known as Malekith (Christopher Eccleston) seeks to collect Jane and use the force to destroy Asgard, and Earth, Thor must enlist in the one person who truly betrayed his trust to help him...Loki (Tom Hiddleston).Under a new direction by Alan Taylor, Thor: The Dark World is actually a solid sequel that surpasses the original. While the original film is very good, it lacked a lot of action scenes. This due to the fact that we had to follow Thor and his interactions with the human characters. Here, we have a perfect balance of it. We are given plenty of action scenes among the Asgardian galaxy and Earth. These scenes are very well-done with excellent CGI. We are also given a lot of comic relief by Tom Hiddleston, and especially Kat Dennings who returns as Jane's intern Darcy (whom also is given much more to do this time around). Stellen Skarsgard also returns as Erik Selvig. This time around however, Selvig is very under-used and gets very much the short-end of the stick as far as what his character gets to do. Admittedly there are moments where the humor can get to be too much, but it's all done in light-hearted fun. Hemsworth and Portman unfortunately like the first film don't have the chemistry that a couple in love should have. But yet they aren't really given the chance to have solid scenes together. Both however give fine performances on their own. What's most notable are the scenes between Hemsworth and Hiddleston, who play off of each other very well. Like the first film, Hiddleston completely loses himself as Loki provides a lot of the great moments in the film. As for the story itself, it goes into a darker territory than the first film does, and it does it well. There are many different emotional situations that Thor goes through that really help Thor show his humanity and where his heart lies. The villain this time around really isn't anything special. He does give Thor many obstacles to go through, but that's it, and he's hardly the villain that Loki was in both the first film and The Avengers.Thor: The Dark World, while having several flaws that include a not-so-great villain, an occasional over-abundance of humor and an under-usage of characters, it doesn't stop it from being a very satisfying sequel with more action, good comic moments, and a darker story with the characters we've come to know and love.My rating: 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I heard a lot of good things before the movie came out, and it did not leave me with regret. Definitely a must watch film. A few things that I felt failed its justice I'm not sure could have been made better without making it a Lord of the Rings film. Firstly, I'm not sure the Dark Elves had enough screen time. They were awesome, and I think they chose some good actors for the part. I just feel they could have used their skills more. Secondly, they could have spent more time on the story about their past. It was good but they could have really highlighted this scenario to expand their fan base and create a cult of nerds. Again not sure if they could have been fixed, but as fiction fan who appreciates lore I have to express that. Lastly, not a big fan of the comedy, but I'm not a fun guy. Everyone else had a good time in the theaters. The acting was pretty good and I believe you felt the drama and emotion between Thor's family. To me that was the highlight of the movie. The custom, props and effects were great. That much said, I believe this movie makes you want to know more about the Marvel Universe and the scene after the credits leaves you handing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent Sequel needing Thor 3 and "Thor Four" *SPOILERS*</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I loved the first film, and with good reason - Kenneth Branaugh directing is always top shelf, and the cast was really strong. I looked forward to the sequel, knowing well it would be hard to match the freshness, art and grandeur of the first film. And the movie-going experience indeed started strange: I showed up right at the start time (11:00 AM matinée'), which by AMC Lowes standard means that I would have 4 - 6 previews to sit through, plus a few ads. Curiously, as I sat down (at 11:03, expecting to see ads..) I came midway into the "X-Men: Days of Future Past" preview. I asked my neighbor if there had been other previews, and he said, "This is the first preview," and I thought 'Goodie! I can see what other Sci Fi or Superhero films are coming soon.' But to my surprise, the movie started next! Totally out of character for AMC. The intro was a laconic (low-key) teaser, which did set the tone for the film (it was a little flat). While I liked the movie (I love the characters - Chris Hemsworth, Natalie Portman, Stellan Skarsgard and Tom Hiddleston - not to mention Sir Anthony Hopkins - are all excellent thespians), I blame the director Alan Taylor for not getting as much emotional reach from them and the story as I would have liked, (but then, I am a genius, and super- critical :&lt;)There were fantastic, well-conceived story ideas in this film, great action, nice unexpected surprises, some cute humor (Dr. Eric Selvig is great as usual - he better be in Thor 3 and "THOR 4/Thorfour?"!!), and Darcy even has some great humorous scenes, too. Plus, I could look at Natalie Portman all day. My chief complaint was the emotional flatness after a certain queen's fate, which could have brought down the house, but the story didn't have time to develop certain relationships, and that is my other complaint; it felt slow in parts, hurried in others. But still, it's one I want in my library, because Marvel has a great franchise here. The fact that Thor was one of my favorite superhero comics as a kid has nothing to do with it, although they have cast the characters as perfect as you can get. I wish I could get hired for the next installment, because they have teed up the trilogy nicely, with many possibilities, and I Hope the actors will find a way to sign contracts for 2 more films, before any other actors are changed (*SPOILER* Switching actors for the part of Fandral wasn't a show-stopper, but I would have liked for them to have kept Josh Dallas from the first Thor).So I give the film an 8/10, although I nearly gave it a 7 (7.5 is probably where it belongs). It's a GOOD movie, not GREAT, and not the first Thor, but an entertaining, exciting, visually compelling, well-acted sequel that I Hope makes enough box office to guarantee the next 2 movies (with Hemsworth, Portman, Hiddleston, Skarsgard at a minimum reprising their roles, and hopefully the others, too). They could do a nice love triangle intrigue between Jamie Alexander - who looks great in this, BTW, and kicks ass convincingly! - and Portman. If you are a fan, you HAVE to see Thor 2, and if you are new to it, by all means see Thor 1 and Avengers first, if you can, as it will be much easier to follow - at a minimum, see Thor 1. The key to the success of this franchise will hinge on the next film, which I can envision as being the best of the series IF they get the story right. This should lead to an Avengers 3, and then back to Thor 4, by which time Hemsworth might be ready to give 'Meow meow' (as Darcy calls Mjolnir) to the next red-caped, crusading Asgardian.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great action, hilarious comedy, and character improvement make this a hit</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Thor: The Dark World is, in short, a hit. With a new and different threat, the battle takes place behind the lines, in wastelands, and on metropolis Earth, rather than the cold world and small town scene of the first film. Trickery, subtlety, and cunning take the place of brute force this time, and it's a good direction to take.The characters, for the large part now established, were furthered well. Malekith (Christopher Eccleston) was played well, but could have spoken up a great deal more near the end. It should have been more shocking when he finally spoke English, in fact I don't recall the exact moment he started.The action in this film was great, but skipped a few beats at times, which is forgivable this time with Loki's interchanges with Thor. Marvel did meet my expectations with intermittent comedy, once again. This sequel was full of it, and each time it was written and performed very well, and got a laugh from the whole audience.The movie is family-friendly except for fantasy violence, two moments of direct violence, partial nudity (a character is shown in public on television, but is thankfully censored), and less worrying details seen here. See it in 3D, see it in 2D, either works. 3D doesn't stand out, for better or worse. All in all, Thor: The Dark World is worth seeing in cinemas.P.S. Stay after all the credits roll, and you'll be doubly rewarded.I was given early access to see the film by Walt Disney Studious. I was not required to write a positive review, and the opinions here are my own.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let's start by saying that I'm a big Marvel fan and I'm loving what they are doing with this film series. Having said that, the first Thor film was a little 'meh'. I'm glad to say this one improves on it in every possible sense. It starts off slow but builds into an engaging and thoroughly enjoyable story.The story is pretty good for a film that makes no logical sense, the characters are well-developed, the action is excellent, the script is good and the jokes are amusing throughout. There is less overacting and the overly Shakespearian language has been toned down a bit, but still present as it should be. And I'm glad to say that there is only one moment for girls to swoon over a shirtless Chris Hemsworth.The CGI and effects were excellent but, for an effects-driven film, they were almost overshadowed by the quiet intense moments between Loki, Odin and Thor. The acting was solid throughout from pretty much every cast member, Hemsworth doing a good job as the hero, Tom Hiddleston and Anthony Hopkins with solid performances and Ecclestone excellent as the menacing villain, even if his motivations and plan don't make much sense. The most surprising thing about this film was its successful attempts to be funny. It could almost be called an action-comedy, with many laugh- out-loud moments. A film that is fairly dark, hence the title, but still doesn't take itself too seriously. There are missteps; I might be the only one who didn't realise that Charing Cross isn't 3 stops from Greenwich, and frankly I didn't care, it was still an amusing sceneThe film itself is littered with Easter eggs and references to other Marvel characters and films, which make it very enjoyable for fans of the comics. The best part of this film was the ending, with a few huge reveals, teases and WTF moments for anyone with knowledge of the comic books. This is simply a well-made superhero film, possibly one of the best ever. Certainly one of the best films of this year.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Thor 2 the dark world is an amazing film full of lots of unexpected scenes in it that i am going to let you find out for yourself. The film was casted extremely well as it is a sequel to Thor. Chris Hemsworth done an excellent job as usual fitting into his character. Tom Hiddleston who plays Loki was an extremely comedic actor in this film and i found that he was naturally funny with the script given and made it his own. Natalie Portman was not you're usual super hero girlfriend that continuously gets into trouble and screams at everything she sees instead she was a very perky character and brave she got her hands dirty helping Thor with his fight. I strongly recommend this film as it has some amazing graphics in.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Humor's the big winner</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Thor: The Dark World has great characters, special effects and decent plot lines but humor was the big winner and at the lead was Kat Dennings. There was drama, action and romance and life and death struggles but these were effectively offset by one-liners and situational comedy without being awkward or detracting. These combined elements made it an all round fun movie to see (in 3d, if you can). There was this wonderful battle between light and dark both in the sets and the characters. Marvel fans must see it but there is enough other enticements to drag along a non-Marvel friend or two. Female presence is strong with Rene Russo, Jaimie Alexander, Kat Dennings and of course Natalie Portman. I know it hasn't come out in the US and I don't want to spoil the fun. Heimdall is a wonderfully complex character even though he has only a fraction of the screen time. As in the first Thor, he is caught between his duty and the greater good. Idris Elba's portrayal of him is one of mystery and sage-like wisdom. Thor's world is rocked but how far? The ending leaves you wondering and hungry for a third.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's hammer time!!! No, I'm not referring to 80s rapper MC Hammer! Thor is back in another great adventure! Read on to find out more!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Thor returns in yet another triumphant adventure. When the original aired in 2011 it was perhaps the Marvel property that people were most skeptical about. The God of Thunder, wearing a red cape, Norse mythology and all, it sounded really silly. It was perhaps this low level of expectation, which I also had for Iron Man, which helped to make it such a success. It was fun and loud with a good heart at its core, not to mention introducing Chris Hemsworth and the outstanding Tom Hiddleston. Their chemistry helped to seal the deal and this continued with their adventures in Avengers.I think over the years, many of us have become quite endeared to all of the Avengers characters, they are almost household names and each new Marvel entry is welcomed with considerable fanfare. Thor: The Dark World is no exception.The story begins by introducing us to the Dark Elves led by Malekith in a time before Thor and Odin. Bor, father of Odin, managed to stop Malekith from using an energy known as the Aether to return the universe to the darkness it once knew before there was creation. The Aether was hidden and the story fell into legend and fable.However, as the alignment of the planets approaches once again, Jane Foster (Natalie Portman), now residing in London, inadvertently makes a discovery that is going to draw her straight into the heart of Thor's latest adventure. Thor is forced to return to Earth and even bring Jane back to Asgard where the Asgardians are given something of a rude awakening. They soon realize that the Dark Elves they remember from their bedtime stories are very real and have once again returned to try and throw the universe back into darkness.This is a great adventure with real consequence. We are reminded that although perceived to be gods by people on Earth during the time of Vikings, Asgardians can be hurt, can be injured, and they frequently do. Thor has to muster more than just physical strength to try and defeat the Dark Elves and it is not without some dire consequences. More than once I found myself wiping away a manly tear from my eye. Thankfully, Thor has the assistance of all his friends from the original movie and they play no small part in helping him try and restore order to the nine realms.I enjoyed once again seeing these characters that I've grown to love and I was happy to see that this movie can be enjoyed as a complete story in its own right, not serving to be just a set up for the next Avengers movie. There is a healthy dose of well-timed humour, which helps to balance the otherwise dark overtones of the story. Performances are great all round, continuing the old world Shakespearean style of banter we have come to expect from Asgardians. I particularly loved some of the imagery seen on Asgard, seeing their world, how they live, watching Thor and Jane meander around the charming streets of this beautiful alien world.I felt Thor seemed somewhat underpowered in this outing, especially after seeing him topple cities with his hammer Mjolnir previously, but this may simply be a reflection of how powerful his adversaries are this time.What I did feel was weak were the 3D effects, so save yourself a buck or two and just watch it in a standard 2D digital screening unless you really want to see the extended Captain America Winter Soldier trailer which is attached to the 3D screening.Another homerun for Marvel, I strongly recommend you catch this on the big screen and, it goes almost without saying, stay right to the end of the credits as there may be more than one golden egg waiting for you.Check it out!Rating 8 out of 10FOR THIS AND OTHER REVIEWS CHECK OUT MAXIMUMEXTREME.NET</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining, but not without flaws</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The opening scenes of Thor:TDW were promising and left me and my sister very excited! However as soon as those were over the movie started rather slowly and took too long to get on track. I felt like quite some time was wasted on comic relief and attempting to explain unnecessary things, instead of character development and the much needed spotlight on the motivation behind certain characters. This made the movie a little bit boring in some scenes and prevented before mentioned characters from truly flourishing, which is a pity. Thankfully the pacing went up a notch after the first act. The movie ended the best way possible and left me hyped for the upcoming MCU movies.I liked the villains. However, where the main villain was quite menacing in some scenes, I do think he was equally unimpressive in other scenes. Chris Hemsworth as Thor was good, although I wished the screenwriters had given him better lines and the director would push him to show more emotion in some scenes. As much as I like Chris, I do think his performance in Rush was better than here. I also wished that Thor's inner struggles were fleshed out a bit more. Tom Hiddleston as Loki was flawless, and without a doubt Loki stole the show in every scene he was in. Loki got nice character development in this movie, and when I look at his journey from Thor to the Avengers to this movie, I think the directors and Hiddleston did a great job with the character.Overall I liked this movie, so my rating would be 7.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Thor The Dark World was everything I was hoping for and quality entertainment from opening scene to the last. The director presents the entire film in a way that can be savored. Many aspects are just plain old fun kick-butt action scenes. It's a perfect blend of action and humor and yet it still remembers to pack a heart. The pacing was perfect even though I would've liked to have seen more quality time spent between Jane and Thor. That would've added more credibility to the chemistry and longing they both display for each other. Besides a few minor shortcuts in story, this film packs quite a punch and is every bit as good as I hoped it would be.Just like Iron Man, they played both sides of the fence perfectly. You need know nothing about the character to enjoy the film yet the fans were respected and spotted the little things that service the story but don't really register to non-fans. There are heavy ties to the events of Avengers but since everyone saw Avengers, that's a good thing.I think this sequel is very well written and proves the character and the mythos have layers to explore. They can't jam everything from the past forty years in to one film but they delivered enough smarts to go along with the spectacle to be sure.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thor faces off with some angry elves.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The word that most comes to mind when describing Thor: The Dark World, is IMPRESSIVE! This second independent Thor film in no way disappoints and in my opinion is only topped by The Avengers in likability. The sheer scope of the movie is awesome. We see a lot more of Asgard and get to bounce around to a few of the Nine Realms for a very enjoyable ride. Director, Alan Taylor does a phenomenal job balancing the action (and there is a lot), the drama, and the humor in this film. There are some genuinely touching scenes in this film, something that Marvel, overall, has done a good job with in the Avengers based films.The basic plot involves some pretty nasty Dark Elves and their desire to unleash some cosmic badness, effectively ending the universe as we know it. These elves are tough hombres. They have stealth ships and weapons powerful enough to cause Asgard and our heroes some real problems. But the heart of the film lies in the relationship between Thor, again played perfectly by Chris Hemsworth, and his mischievous brother, Loki, who Tom Hiddleston has made my favorite villain. The best moments are between these two. I won't throw out any spoilers, but I will say that Loki is spectacular.Natalie Portman is back as Jane Foster, Thor's love interest, as is Stellan Skarsg?rd, who is very fun to watch as Erik Selvig, the slightly off astrophysicist. Anthony Hopkins, puts in another turn as Odin, Thor's old man and conveys a tiredness of the old king as he once again faces war with an old enemy.See this film in the theater. The big screen is the right place to enjoy this piece of epic story telling. And remember, wait till the credits end before you go...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>MARVELously entertaining.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Watching Thor: The Dark World tonight, I got the feeling that Hollywood might have finally gotten the hang of it. In theory, a sequel should always surpass its predecessor, although as we all know, many have tried and famously failed. But a new trend seems to finally be breaking through. X2 was better than X-Men. Spider-Man 2 was better than the first. And now that I've seen it, I can tell you Thor: The Dark World? is better than Thor. (And the fact that these are all Marvel productions, that's food for anther discussion.)I thoroughly enjoyed Thor, directed by Kenneth Branagh, when I only saw it for the first time just this spring. In fact, I watched it again the same week. Which is saying enough to imply that my hopes were high for the sequel. So I was really looking forward to tonight and I was not disappointed.Thor 2 was helmed by a different director, Alan Taylor, which typically always spells trouble in my book when they change the director, but I take my hat off to him. What I admire is that he managed to capture the tone that Branagh set in the first film flawlessly ? even perfected it in a way. He brings to the table a duality which almost never works successfully in any film, but here, does so perfectly: Taylor made Thor 2 notably darker, yet at the same time more humorous. I take my hat off to the writers as well ? they put in a ton of great jokes, all at the exactly right moment. Had this been done even a fraction less tactfully, the film would have sunk like a bag of bricks, like so many others have. I found myself (and the audience) laughing my butt off one moment, and feeling very serious and engaged with the on-screen emotions the next. Even when it happened abruptly, it still never felt inappropriate. Now that's good entertainment. Two thumbs up.The actors all wear their roles like a custom- made suit. It's obvious that Chris Hemsworth has really grown into his character, third time around. This guy IS Thor, hands down. The same goes for all the other actors, they were all perfectly comfortable in their roles and respective environments. The one that intrigued me most, however, was Loki ? personified absolutely magnificently by Tom Hiddleston. Much like Hemsworth, it seems he was born to play this role. He captures all the slyness, all the arrogance and all the torment of a man almost unable to bear the weight of his own ego in a single flicker in his eyes. And then that grin? Perfection. The way Hiddleston plays Loki is strangely captivating. You know he's totally wicked and cannot be trusted, yet at the same time you can't help but really like him ? you might even end up rooting for this guy, and I'm not sure many other actors would have managed this.All the special effects were as good as one should expect them to be these days. I have nothing much to say there, except that it was all terrifically eye-pleasing, and Asgard looked even more beautiful than before. It was all convincing and very well done. Still, I have not completely explained why T:TDW is better than the first. Actually, I might not fully be able to. It's mostly a feeling. As much as I was entertained the first time, I was even more entertained now. It was more action-packed, more exciting, darker and it just had a great deal more adrenaline. The only thing that I think was weaker in this film, was the character of Jane Foster. Her character was just less interesting, kind of blank. I actually don't remember much of her at all, except that she slapped Thor a couple of times and she had all this creepy stuff coming out of her? Also she was somewhat of a damsel-in- distress most of the time with the look of a scared kitten on her face, and that's not exactly how we like to see our ladies nowadays. It's so common to see women being perfectly independent now, that it's a little weird to see a grown woman with "three degrees in physics" (as Darcy so poignantly points out) scared and shivering like a little girl. Most of the time, Natalie Portman just didn't carry her scenes very strongly, and that's strange coming from such a fine actress. So maybe one of the actors was actually a little out of place after all, thinking about it. Having said that, that's pretty much my only complaint. Every other element in this film was very solid, the story was very good and they absolutely nailed the pacing. Those two hours went by in the blink of a eye. Thor: The Dark World is wonderfully entertaining and a definite must-see for every Marvel fan. In fact ? at the risk of enraging the Marvel Gods ? this might just be pretty stiff competition to X-Men? Watch out Wolverine, I think I have a new favorite superhero.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well, I'm a fan now!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't go for Thor's movies because I was not the biggest fan for comic books. I was more into girly stuff. However this movie kept me interested the whole time!Although the movie starts with an epic fight, I consider The first part of the movie as very humorous and light (lovely thing); then it gets into action mode.A couple of concepts that grabbed my attention:*The convergence between the worlds. *The way they gave Thor's mother the farewell. *The shape of the Dark Elves' ship. *The implosion grenades. *The volatility and texture of the Aether and the beauty of its prison. *Malekith resting chambers. *Algrim/Kurse's fast killing ways. *The masks or helmets used by the enemy's troop. *The world traveling fighting scene. *Malekith's language. How beautiful.Elements that make this movie unique:*Several grisly scenes throughout the movie. *The depth in Loki's character personality. *Gorgeous cinematography, especially in the scene where Thor's mother is sent away, far far away. *The pace of the movie brings the elements together in a sensationalist way to keep the ADD's attentive.Things that surprised me:*Loki's cooperation with Thor and the whole situation. *That Loki was alive after Kurse stabbed him. *Loki was so excited when he was released from his cell, and a bit comical. *Seeing Stan Lee in the mad house or the mental ward. *The ending (where Loki is pretending to be Odin) and the other ending where The Collector shows his ulterior purpose to give cue to the next movie. I just don't know what happens next in the comic books, so for me this was a surprise.LOVED IT: *Darcy making out with that intern (Ian). *Heimdall's performance like always. *Frigga's fighting scene. *Erick Selvig running around naked. *When Thor and Jane F. come into her apt. *The beautiful Asgard world and its gardens. *When Thor believes Loki is dying.Still expecting: *A mini cat fight between Sif and Jane, because Sif was literally throwing herself to Thor. *A visual of the Dark Elves destiny. *Romantic final scene between Thor and Jane, maybe they get to the next level? *Odin's fate since Loki took his place. *Thanos appearance and maybe Death's as well. If you wish to find out about the story line, there are great reviews here on IMDb, however this one is a summary version.I give this movie 8 IMDb stars!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Covers Basics of a Great Sequel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw "Thor: The Dark World", starring Chris Hemsworth-Red Dawn-2012, Star Trek-2009; Natalie Portman-Black Swan, Zoolander; Tom Hiddleston- The Avengers-2012, The Deep Blue Sea; Christopher Eccleston-G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra, Doctor Who-t.v.-2005 and Anthony Hopkins-Red 2, The Mask of Zorro.This is the second Thor movie, or actually the third, if you count the Avengers, and it covers all the basics of a good sequel. Chris returns as Thor, fighting the battle against evil dark elves, who are led by Christopher, as Malekith. It seems that there is an evil energy force called the Aether, which is so powerful that it could mean the end of everything, and guess who wants it? Yep, Christopher. FYI: For all the comic book nerds like me, the Aether is known by another name that you should know, it's one of the six Infinity Gems. Anthony returns as Odin, the father of Chris and the king of the nine realms, including Asgard, their home planet. Tom returns as Chris's evil brother Loki, who is sentenced by Anthony to be put into the deepest dungeon that can be found on Asgard, mainly for his part in the Avengers escapade in New York. Natalie has found her way to London, in her search for Chris; she wants to find a connection between Earth and Asgard so that they can be reunited. The only problem is that she gets into a situation where she ends up possessing the elusive Aether that Christopher wants and the hunt is on. Chris even has to bust his brother Tom out of jail to help in the good fight. But, can Tom be trusted? One of his nicknames is 'The Trickster' or god of lies. There are some good fight sequences, I especially liked it when Chris would spin his hammer before applying it to the job at hand, just like in the comics. I also liked the balance of humor with the action. As far as cameos go, Stan Lee appears in the mental hospital scene-he wants his shoe back-and there is a small scene with the appearance of another super hero in costume. When the end credits start, there is a scene, and then at the very end is another scene, so don't leave early, or you will miss the set up for the next movie. It's rated "PG-13" for violence and mild language and has a running time of 1 hour &amp; 52 minutes. I really enjoyed it and would buy it on Blu-Ray.</fullReview>

The Screenplay is powerfully constructed. Christopher Yost, Christopher Markus &amp; Stephen McFeely's Screenplay moves on a feverish pace &amp; gives enough scope for some hardcore action-sequences. The Battle between Thor &amp; the Villains is a delight to watch, while sequences with Thor &amp; Evil brother Loki, are equally memorable. Alan Taylor's Direction is ambitious. Cinematography &amp; Editing are excellent. Graphics are outstanding. Performance-Wise: Chris Hemsworth is awesome as Thor. He delivers even more confidently this time. Natalie Portman is perfect as Jane Foster. Tom Hiddleston as Loki, is fabulous. Christopher Eccleston as the despicable Makekith, is impressive. Sir Anthony Hopkins as Odin, is good. Idris Elba as Heimdall, is efficient. Rene Rosso &amp; Kat Dennings shine in small roles. On the whole, 'Thor: The Dark World' is pure popcorn entertainment. Go For It!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Surprisingly Good Superhero Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am usually not a fan of the superhero genre. However, I did watch most of the recent superhero films due to my sister being a huge fan of them. I'm usually unimpressed with superhero movies, even with the successful Avengers and the Batman trilogy. It is a massive challenge to create an entertaining storyline in a film that everybody knows the hero is going to win in the end. Recent superhero films (especially Man of Steel) failed at this and I was prepared to face disappointment upon stepping into the cinema hall.Thor The Dark World was one that I can honestly say was entertaining. Surprisingly. I think I was generally happy with it because of the realism of the conflict that they face. In the Avengers, when alien beings attacked earth, humans on earth somehow decides to do almost nothing. No appropriate military action by earth's governments. It's the same with Iron Man 3, US military did nothing when the president was captured.In Thor The Dark World, the threat was at Asgard. The whole of Asgard was ready to go to war. Due to the effects of the alignment of the Nine Realms, portals between worlds were opened but as it all happened too sudden, nobody from other realms was able to react on it. This is more believable than the Avengers' situation (where Loki was on Earth for a long period of time and Shield knew he was up to something having stolen the Tesseract yet no military action were taken when the aliens attacked).You still have to ignore some plot holes and ridiculous logics (like why Asgardians still fight with swords and shields when their enemy who were in suspended animation for the last 5000 years had laser guns) but it was still very entertaining for a superhero film. The development of the main characters were done satisfyingly. Thor, who were a rash, short-tempered Asgardian prince with a thirst for war, is now more mature and sensible in making decisions. We also saw the other side of Loki despite his continuous mischiefs.The balance of action, humour and "superhero realism" makes it fun to watch. It's not overly complicated but it's also not too dumb or predictable. Overall I'm quite happy with this film and I would recommend it to anyone who is starting to lose faith in the superhero genre.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For me, between the avengers super heroes, Thor is the least interesting than the others. I think that the first thor movie is not that great, so I came to the theater with no high expectation. But this movie is actually awesome. The story is great, the duration's not too long, nor too short, it's enough. The casts are great. Chris played thor well. He showed the emotion, but still can keep his arrogance. The effect is amazing. I watched it in 2D (because for me, 3D just ruin the story), but I can still feel the effect. There are some little joke that actually made this movie better. The audiences cant stop laughing during the movie. So for conclusion, this movie is great, I think its better than the previous one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Bad, Not Great.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After seeing Thor: The Dark World, I'm puzzled as to how it's scored 8.0 on IMDb, when the far superior prequel gained only a 7.0? What's noticeably missing is Kenneth Branagh's Shakespearean touch, the whole grandiose spectacle of it all. Everything which made Thor charming is missing from this and even cast changes (Zachary Levi as a replacement for Josh Dallas and surprisingly, quite a forgettable Fandral, seeing as he was the original choice.) Poor Ray Stevenson doesn't have much to do, and Jaimie Alexander casts a bitchy stare at Jane Foster, but nothing else ever comes out of it. Whereas in the first movie, we all gawped at Chris Hemsworth's magnificent physique, we now get a Loaded Weapon 1 moment, where I half expected to see one of those "unmotivated butt-in-the-moonbeam walks." Chris Eccleston isn't used to full villainy advantage as Malekith and wasn't really sure what his true motives were (nor did I actually care.) The first half is OK, while the second is more entertaining, if very far-fetched. Alan Taylor may have directed outstanding episodes for Game of Thrones, but here, he's delivered an uneven package with lacklustre action and forced, hammy dialogue for actors who deserve better. That said, Tom Hiddleston does have fun and seems to be the only one. Kat Dennings routine as Darcy should be getting stale by now, but does provide some comedic highlights. If Marvel wants to rival the greatest film franchise in history (James Bond of course) it had better pull its socks up. Sure, 007 has had its misses but it also knew how to reboot itself and stay fresh. I'm not convinced neither Stan Lee or Kevin Fiege have a game plan and this could be their downfall. This was a kiddies outing, but when you look at the richness of The Avengers and Joss Whedon's literary prowess, they need that kind of impetus to stay afloat.I'm now convinced that Captain America: The Winter Soldier, will be my most anticipated superhero sequel (as it's a surefire bet that Singer will mess up Days of Future Past and turn it into Wolverine 6.)More fun than kickass (with a great cameo in the middle) this gets 7/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best Marvel movie after The Avengers &amp; the best superhero movie of the year!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Thor: The Dark World continues with the story of the God of Thunder, Thor(Chris Hemsworth). After Loki(Tom Hiddleston), is imprisoned for his despicable crimes in New York(these events take place in The Avengers) by Odin(Anthony Hopkins), Thor along with Sif(Jaimie Alexander), Fandral(Zachary Levi), Volstagg(Ray Stevenson) &amp; Hogun(Tadanobu Asano) set about the task of bringing peace &amp; harmony to the nine realms. However, when an ancient &amp; extremely dangerous substance called the Aether gets unleashed into the universe it is up to Thor, to stop the Dark Elves led by Malekith(Christopher Eccleston) from laying their hands on the Aether. However, Thor can't do this on his own. So, he seeks the help of his estranged brother, Loki. Thor also returns to Midgard aka Earth to protect his love interest, Jane Foster(Natalie Portman) at any cost. I freaking loved this film! It was definitely the best superhero movie of the year. It was even better than Superman reboot, Man of Steel because even though it was action packed, there were humorous scenes as well. The 3D was effective except, in the scenes with dialogs. The special effects were out of this world. I loved the fact that there was more Asgard, this time. I also liked that they introduced us to more worlds like, Anaheim &amp; Svartalfheim. The climax was so unexpected &amp; mind blowing. This is the only Marvel film, to have such an unforeseen twist. This film was way better than Thor(2011). It was way more action packed &amp; hilarious compared to Kenneth Branagh's watered down original. The performances was definitely one, of the many pros of the film. Chris Hemsworth plays the part of Thor, to perfection. Natalie Portman is brilliant as Jane Foster. However the standout performer in the film is, yet again, Tom Hiddleston as Loki. Hiddleston's cheeky &amp; witty dialog delivery keeps the viewers guffawing for a good part of the film. However, Loki can turn terrifying in an instant. This shows what a versatile actor Tom Hiddleston is. No matter how despicable Loki is, I can pretty much guarantee that everyone loves Loki. This is the magic of Hiddleston. Anthony Hopkins is great as Odin. Christopher Eccleston is menacingly evil as Malekith. Jaimie Alexander, Zachary Levi, Ray Stevenson &amp; Tadanobu Asano are impressive as Sif, Fandral, Volstagg &amp; Hogun respectively. Idris Elba is spectacular as Heimdall. Rene Russo is outstanding as Frigga. Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje is effective as Algrim/Kurse. Kat Dennings &amp; Stellan Skarsgard are great as Darcy Lewis &amp; Erik Selvig respectively. If I had to pick one teeny tiny flaw then that would be that, the film was too short. I would have loved an extra ten to fifteen minutes. Anyway, Thor: The Dark World is a must watch for pretty much everyone, even the Marvel haters.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great comic book adaption</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Thor: The Dark World is a great superhero movie which combines elements from fantasy and scifi movies. There is enough surprise moment and humor to keep it ongoing and sustainable. Movie lends shameless elements from Star Wars and Lord of The Rings movies and combines them together to an original adventure. Movie looks and sounds beautiful. Bouncing between different dimensions could easily be confusing but director Alan Taylor keeps them tightly together. Even the length of the movie is suitable, less than two hours, which is great remittance despite all the action and scenery. That ensures that you won't get bored and movie rumbles through it's duration like fast train. Balance between humor and drama is great in spite of some murky moments. It is good to see that Marvel takes good care it's movies and combines finely different productions. That ensures nice comic feeling in their movies. Unquestionably Thor: The Dark world is Marvel's elite in these comic book adaptions. The end of the movie promises more sequels for this sledge hammer hero. I just hope they have more courage to bring elements from Asgard mythology in upcoming sequels. That would make this even more enjoyable movie experience. Hemsworth is good choice as Thor but Natalie Portman's role leaves a little bit too easy. Great entertainment no matter what.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Went to see this yesterday and had a great time watching this. It was great to see a bit more of Asgard this time around although would have also loved some more of the rest of the realms itself. Loved that they showed Vanaheim in the beginning. Lots of humour already right from the start of the movie &amp; that continued throughout the movie. Gripping one liners &amp; nice little surprises like the "Captain America" appearance, which had the room bursting out with laughter yesterday. Also loved the insight we got into Loki's soul after what happened to Frigga. It gave the character more depth &amp; explains why he does end up siding with Thor after all. They all did a brilliant job on the fight sequences, loved watching those as they weren't extremely long. Great CGI stuff although a bit obvious when they had to do close ups. It's shot in a darker light ( if that makes sense ) but I liked that bit as the movie tone is set in a darker mood. The chemistry between Jane &amp; Thor was better compared to the 1 st movie IMO. I believe Hemsworth was a better Thor as he had to grow into his character in the 1st movie, whereas Hiddleston owned the Loki character from the 1st minute he put on the horns. At least that is how I perceived it. Heimdall was awesome &amp; I liked that he got more screen time this movie. Was expecting more from Malekith movie wise, missed some of that darkness that really started of this war..Tom Hiddleston as Loki however stole the show as Hiddleston has embraced this character completely &amp; is totally in touch with how Loki should be portrayed.The ending made me grin as I had a serious "Hell No!" Moment at a certain point in the movie, just sitting in my seat shaking my head in disbelief...but I shouldn't have worried really.Worth the wait &amp; looking forward to seeing the next instalment!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw The Dark World yesterday and was not disappointed. Not like Iron man, that I really liked only to see a really bad sequel and a not so good second sequel, this movie delivers all the way. A really good cast, a story fit for this movie, heaps of action, great special effects and balanced and effective humor made this a real fun experience. I will not give anything away but I do recommend you stay in your seat till the very end!! There is to much to write down here and you should see it for yourself but this is up there with the Avengers and Spiderman 1 and 2, it's just that good and that much fun. And let's be honest, who wan's to leave the cinema being sorry he went. This is not likely in this case!I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Marvel continue to show they understand their characters (and their audience) better than anyone else with Thor:The Dark World. I'm trying to write a virtually spoiler-free review so I won't go into the plot, other than to say it chuggs along nicely, and the second half of the movie is laced with humour. All the cast from the first movie return and the new villain is Malekith (Christopher Eccleston) a dark-elf on a mission to restore what he sees is the natural order of the universe. And everyone is given a moment or too to do their thing, from Hopkins' gravitas to Stellen Starsgard's bonkers scientist, the film does not disappoint.Forget the scientific gobbledegook explanations that explain the plot - just have fun with this rollicking fantasy adventure, that even goes a bit Star Warsy at times. Natalie Portman must have smiled at being asked to do a lakeside scene not dissimilar from what we saw in Attack Of The Clones. I certainly did.As ever Chris Hemsworth and Tom Hiddleston are at the heart of what makes this movie tick - Hiddlestone again is terrific, easily one of the best Superhero movie villains. Hemsworth again does well as Thor.The numerous effects are splendid but unlike Man Of Steel, not overbearing, and the film itself has a pretty epic feel at times. Alan Taylor's direction is very assured. The constant world-hopping may jar the uninitiated but the film is very enjoyable, and is mercifully 120 minutes or so long; and in an era when Hollywood excess often gives you a bum-numbing 150+ minute movies, that's surely no bad thing. Excellent. Can't wait for Captain America: The Winter Solidier.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had high expectations for this film, and boy, was I NOT disappointed. I absolutely loved it. The amount of plot twists were uncountable. I think Marvel did great, great follow-up to Thor/The Avengers. My personal favorite is Loki, and I simply cannot wait till his next featuring. This is definitely a recommended watch. It has action for the guys, love for the girls, and everything else. There is actually no crtitiscm I can give you about this movie. I can't think of any crappy Hollywood movie cliché's. In my point of view, this movie was amazing. Story line was great, actors were great, the lines were great, everything was great. Ten out of ten from me.</fullReview>

This - along with the 'X-Men' franchise - shows how to bring a comic-book onto the big screen and do it so that it feels like a comic-book and also it's own original movie.

		<shortDescription>Not quite as compelling nor emotionally engaging as its predecessor, this post-Avengers sequel still packs plenty of jaw-dropping action and some well-placed humour</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like 'Iron Man 3', 'Thor: The Dark World' finds us reunited with the hammer-wielding Norse demigod in a post-Avengers world, where - for the benefit of those who may not remember - Loki was last seen returned to his home planet of Asgard in manacles after wrecking half of New York following a megalomaniac plot to take over Earth. And so, picking up right after the events of that movie, one of the very early scenes has Loki meeting his stepfather and King, Odin (Anthony Hopkins), expressing absolutely no remorse for his actions before being committed to a glass- walled whited-out cell in the dungeon.It's a huge pity we say, keeping Loki locked up for pretty much the first hour of the movie; indeed, the best moments of 'Thor: The Dark World' are when Thor and his vengeful adopted brother Loki share the same screen, forging a shaky alliance to take down a common enemy that has united them (surprisingly) in grief. Thanks to their combined charisma, this sequel defies the second-act doldrums of most movies, truly coming to life at the halfway mark - beginning with Thor's treacherous plan to spring Loki out of prison (with the help of his pals of course) and continuing on to the black dunes of Svartalfheim where the squabbling siblings confront their foe. Yet, not to get ahead of ourselves, there is of course a fair bit of scene-setting that needed to have taken place in order for our favourite hero and anti-hero to be brought together under those circumstances. Working from a story from Don Payne and Robert Rodat, screenwriters Christopher L. Yost, Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely spin a Tolkiensque plot where the leader of an antagonistic alien race, Malekith (Christopher Eccleston), returns to plot the destruction of the Nine Realms using an all-powerful source of dark matter known as the Aether.Long story short, a once-in-5000-years cosmic occurrence is about to converge the realms across time and space, which inadvertently causes Thor's Earthly love interest Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) to fall into a different realm when investigating the phenomenon and be infected with the Aether. Malekith wants her, so Thor jumps to her rescue to bring her back to Asgard - though the price of his half-valiant and half-selfish (after all, he does want to be close to her) act is laid bare when Malekith arrives at the kingdom and launches a deadly assault on Odin's palace. Switching back and forth between Asgard and Earth, the trio of Yost, Markus and McFeely clearly struggle to find a consistent tone especially at the start. While the threat facing Asgard is treated with the utmost seriousness and solemnity, the proceedings back on Earth unfold with strained humour - whether the awkwardness between Jane's understudy Darcy (Kat Dennings) and her new intern Ian (Jonathan Howard), or even the odd behaviour of Jane's old mentor, Dr. Erik Selvig (Stellan Skarsgard), who goes butt naked in public at the Stonehenge. Between the two, we are much better off at Asgard, where veteran 'Game of Thrones' director Alan Taylor is on more familiar territory.It is also at Asgard that Taylor will stage the film's first stunning setpiece, which culminates in the turning point that sees Thor and Loki form that unlikely partnership. Malekith's assault on Asgard is staged with impressive clarity, starting from their stealth crossing at the Bi- frost bridge to their aerial attack of Asgard's defences to their storming of Odin's palace. There is little doubt Taylor's experience on the HBO series has placed him in good stead here, and more than previous director Kenneth Branagh, he demonstrates a boldness and imagination to stage the action on a much larger canvas.That is also a nice segue into the reunion of Thor and Loki, which proves rewarding not just in the witty energetic banter that follows but also in yet another wowing setpiece that has the pair teaming up to outsmart Malekith. There is also crackling tension between them, especially since one knows better from the events of 'Thor' and 'The Avengers' than to trust the scheming Loki to have abandoned his insatiable thirst for power and position. Unfortunately, Loki doesn't quite have a place in the nonetheless outstandingly conceived finale set in Greenwich, London; that said, what adrenaline Loki's return brings to the film is still very much intact by the final showdown rolls around.Kudos to Taylor for putting up not just a thrilling, but also an extremely fun exercise in physical displacement at the climax, as Thor pursues Malekith across multiple dimensions in the midst of the convergence. Rather than just visual spectacle, there is good tongue-in- cheek fun to be had as the characters appear and disappear from one realm to another without forewarning - and we especially like that one which ends up with Thor taking the Tube three stations from Charing Cross to Greenwich. Unlike Christopher Nolan's superhero screen incarnations 'The Dark Knight' and even 'Man of Steel', Marvel has never failed to find humour in the midst of spectacle, and this enormously entertaining finale is a great example of that.And yet compared to Branagh's origin story, there is still something lacking in this sequel. For one, the narrative isn't quite as compelling this time round - especially as Malekith proves quite the underwhelming villain. For another, it lacks the humanity that made its predecessor something more - and by this we mean not just the bond between Thor and Loki, but also that between Thor and Jane. Still, you cannot fault the assuredness of the performances by Chris Hemsworth and Tom Hiddleston, nor for that matter the action, otherworldly grandiosity and occasionally well-placed humour that makes it an overall crowdpleaser - if anything, it proves the Marvel juggernaut continues to be very much in shape, no less evident from a mid-credit and a post-credit scene that will have its fans in rapture.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Slightly over rated but still worth watching.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Likes : OK ill start by saying I have a positive review to tell you but I have a negative one as well, as this film is slightly overrated. Marvels director Alan Taylor has done a good job with this as its enjoyable to watch, it has it (WTH) funny moment that you do find yourself laughing at because it was funny special some of the Thor &amp; Loki moments in the film.This film does have a dark tone which might be disturbing for younger viewers, visual effect were brilliant as we see lot more of Asgard after the first film, I will say it more of emotional storyline to be honest this time I did find myself tearing up in some parts.There isn't as much character development as the first film, and Thor's friends are nowhere near as interesting as the Avengers. I guess they simply needed these characters to all remain as they were so as to keep continuity within the Marvel universe, but it's noticeable how little impact the storyline will have on anybody.Christopher Eccleston played as Malekith the Accursed dark elves leader played a some what insane bad guy that wanted to turn all the worlds to darkness, there isn't much in the way to say why he was doing this other than the back-story of the darks elves &amp; this world destroying energy.There is a bit at end of the credit but there is a bit mid credits that seems to lend toward Thanos possible for some reason, it was just that one scene that had that mysterious feel to it like something bigger was going on behind the scenes but we don't know yet, as we've heard Avenger 2 or 3 will have Thanos appear so it could be a link but its unclear at this moment.With the character of Loki I did think it was going to be a little repetitive since he been 3 films now but I believe he's character has more of a big part to play in coming events I think he's still working for the dark forces of Thanos for some reason because of he behaviour or it just Loki being Loki. What I did notice was a bit of a jealously Starr from Sith (Jaimie Alexander) to Jane (Natalie Portman) because from what you can see Sith has a thing for Thor even in a moment of the film a scene with Thor &amp; Odin seem to suggest that.This film in the way of fighting scene dose have a few battles but not much, probably the most important character in the film showed just what he can do even tho he a gate keeper but from what I saw he can seriously kick ass Heimdall play brilliant actor Idris Elba I through it about time some one write him in the storyline doing something awesome instead of just watch the gate &amp; the universe because he has such a style in he acting he stands out with an on screen presence.For me the comical moment were OK but some people mite find this ruins the dark tone of the film because it become less of a serious film at times &amp; more of a comedy film of Thor, but it enjoyable to watch.Dislikes : The negative side of this film, is the slight humour I did find that it wasn't really need but Disney being Disney they want a film that kids can watch as well, I think Malekith character as to why he want to turn the worlds into dark could of been explain in the back story but it wasn't real much explained .My only real complaint about this film was the way it ended the last 5 Min's of the film You could see what was going on but there was curtain elements as to why &amp; what the hell is happening.It leave you with an open ending with no closure with you wanting to see more to see what is going on in that scene but that where the credits role. This main is why I feel this film is slightly overrated .</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After watching twice in 3D TTDW, this including a re-watch of Thor1 , I am happy to say that after the exposition of K Branagh, A Taylor has upped the ante. TTDW could have been titled The Dark Realm as some essential scenes are shot in Svartalfheimr but as it concerns also the dark moods we all come across in our lives when we lose a dear one be it a lover, be it a sibling, world as a word is appropriated.A reproach many times heard about superheroes movies is that there is a small sprinkling of girls with superpowers yet most of the female persuasion is limited to the role of damsel in distress down to IM3 Pepper Potts who is given superpowers at the end ... because probably no woman can handle a tough situation without having superpowers? Well, sisters: you will be pleased to know that TTDW is the feminist movie of the year. Frigga is the wisest and most courageous of all Asgard, Darcy saves the day without any superpowers and Jane is the feistiest of heroins without any 'extra-terrestrial help.Which does not mean our boys are not for some (a lot of) actions. The battle scene of the invasion of Asgard by Malekith is thrilling. Odin unravels just as badly as Loki and we stop wondering where our Trickster learnt to deal with stress by having tantrums and shooting mean one-liners. Loki grows up down to a scene where we realise Thor knows more his brother than we thought. Both are deeply wounded and yes, the power of Love sees through the illusions and it is heart-breaking. by the way, this is not a spoiler: you need to bring some tissues: there is a scene which is a real tear jerker! If T Hiddleston is Loki (well Loki as in MARVEL), C Hemsworth is the Thunderer true and through. And both get their just deserts! Will Odin mellow, remains to be seen. I have no concern about A Hopkins performance; but I am concerned by an ageing wonderful actor. If would be wise of Marvel Studios to Short filming a few scenes ahead... in case... Mind you the cliffhanger is such that we could get not only a new Odin, but a new Loki.Rene Russo is brilliant, Alice Krige must return. What of the new Fandral: I like him! But please more of Hogun: his fighting skills are awesome: do not mess with Hogun the Grim. Zachari Levi must get the part of the remake of Captain Blood, as for Volstagg : he is just spot on. Jamie Alexander will come back: not only she deserves it but an wider, bigger and atypical role. If it is the one I suspect, the two actors are going to have fun. Am I cryptic enough? I believe I am.What of Midgard: Stan Lee and his shoe, Selvig and his absence of shoe ... and the rest. A wonderful battle with Malekith...An aether which is a real villain. Which leads us to the villain: the real villain who is the guy who went berserk in the editing room and cut out so many scenes. Let's hope the DVD bring us all the deleted scenes which are crying out loud lacking in the movie. Easily 10 if not 20 minutes of them!!! Yes, I am looking at you, K Feige.I am not impressed by the editing of the MARVEL Studios and certainly not impressed at all by the mid credit scene. If this is the best you can come up regarding Benicio Del Toro and the Collector it does not bode well at all for GOTG. Marvel, a cue: filming movies like a 1960s Dr Who or Star Trek is OK in the 1960s; not in 2013.C Eccleston said famously he was not a happy elf. I approve. The Dark Elves may have been a force to reckon with and the scenes for their blitzkrieg on Asgard are awesome but their part should be meatier, chunkier... and it is not. As we are privy (unbelievable but true) to a real difference of opinion between A Taylor and K Feige as the former refuses to take responsibility for the garish vulgar clumsy mid credit scene and the latter is literally glued to him in case he spills the beans. So the post credit scene shows such elegance and homage to the Jotunheim Thor 1 scene , we know that A Taylor must have filmed more scenes about the elves which weave into the tapestry of TTDW. Sadly, some insane guy of Marvel Towers took over. Hearme, you took over but we are not dupe! I shall return again and again. It is totally worth it. Waiting eagerly for Thor 3 and fingers cross Loki 1!In resume: TTDW, great story/movie/cast/score/director. Lousy producer.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>All is going well in Asgard: Loki is imprisoned after the New York incident, and Thor has restored order to the 9 Realms. Odin's favoured son is in his Dad's good books. But no-one has reckoned on Dark Elf lord Malekith coming out of hiding with secret weapon Aethir. To add complication, the Aethir takes up residence in Jane Foster. And Thor is definitely NOT in her good books - "Why didn't you at least phone?" The second solo outing for Marvel's God of Thunder is very much its own beast, although seeing the first movie and the Avengers will help. And the good news is that it is very entertaining. At times it felt like a Star Wars movie - a good one. The supporting cast all return (Fandral is re-cast) and much more of the movie, especially action sequences, take place in Asgard. There are some punch-the-air moments, some humour, some emotion, and certain of the relationships are developed nicely. Not everything goes as you would expect. Watch out for... no, no spoilers! I loved this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS*I attended a premiere screening with high hopes for this film, and left feeling really accomplished. Alan Taylor had placed a fresh input in this film and it worked incredibly.I watched it in 3D. I didn't think it was necessary to watch it in 3D, as it wasn't used to its best. But, I watched it due to the fact I wanted to see it the day before it's release and Tom Hiddleston!Stellar performances all around. Chris Hemsworth, good. Tom Hiddleston, great. Christopher Eccleston, good. Anthony Hopkins, great. Kat Dennings, hilarious as usual. Stellan Skarsgard, just as funny as Dennings. One characters I believed didn't being her best performance to the table was Natalie Portman, yet this must of had to do with the director conflict back in late 2011- early 2012.This movie, without a doubt, is one of the more funnier Marvel movies the franchise has to offer. Loki had most of the laughable lines, his name being 'the god of mischief' and same goes for Dennings and Skarsgard The action scenes were great and quite realistic, feeling like you truly were in the nine realms.Finalizing quickly, this brought much more then the original Thor in my opinion in terms of action, plot and performances. Major plot twists are well thought and unexpected, which pleased a fan such as myself. Overall, one of the best movies I have seen all 2013. Eight stars."When do we start?"</fullReview>

There is not one single unnecessary, exaggerated, dull or boring scene (some events which could easily be told by cliché scenes are artistically presented) and this is a sign that the film-makers of Thor: The Dark World take what they do serious and respect the audience. So we had everything we expect from a good comic-book film, beautiful visuals, fight scenes (neither long nor meaningless), fun chemistry between Thor and Loki, intelligent twists and tricks, great acting by Hopkins and Hiddleston, funny moments which made the audience laugh out loud. Go and see it, great entertainment. (Don't leave the theater during the credits, you know, it's a Marvel film.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A much stronger entry into the Avengers universe than both Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D and Iron Man 3</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Firstly I would like to say I am a big fan of the modern day marvel films. However, I was extremely disappointed with Iron Man 3 it lost its focus half way through with one of the most ridiculously executed twists I have ever seen. Thankfully Thor:The Dark World gets these right. There are many moments throughout the film where it looks like it is set in one direction and then it completely changes course and this makes it extremely entertaining to watch. Apart from questionable performances from Anthony Hopkins (who is one my favourite actors) and Christopher Eccleston, the performances are excellent. Chris Hemsworth has never been better as the God of Thunder but it is Tom Hiddlestone's performance as Loki which steals the show. He is without doubt a joy to watch on screen and always demands attention as it is never quite clear what it is he is about to do. It is this unpredictability that undermines the true villain Malekith who is fairly weak in comparison. Now the story. The story is fairly basic; ancient evil after an evil power source which can destroy the universe etc. But it is the way in which it unfolds which is so captivating. With many fairly shocking moments which drive the story to a more darker road. This brings about my only complaint on how the actual story is told. There are several moments where the story is quite emotionally driven and these scenes are the highlights of the film. Yet after each seen they jump straight to comedy elements and it just doesn't seem natural all the time. Don't get me wrong the comedic parts are some of the best (the Captain America scene was incredibly funny) it is just too much of a drastic change. All in all this is a must watch for fans of Marvel. It is better than the first in my opinion and much better than Iron Man 3.</fullReview>

The powers on Asgaard contain this force and keep it hidden for thousands of years, only to be found by none other than astrophysicist Jane Foster (Natalie Portman). When The Aether takes possession of Jane, of course, Thor (Chris Hemsworth) comes to her rescue. However, as Asgaard and the Nine Realms face the resurgence of the Dark Elves led by the diabolical Malakeith (Christopher Eccleston), a catastrophic planetary alignment threatens to end the existence of the whole world. Thor was forced to solicit his incarcerated renegade brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston) to help him with his elaborate rescue plan. Can the two estranged brothers actually work for one common goal?Honestly the first hour of this new Thor film was so dark it was almost dull. The computer-generated special effects looked so fake and unimpressive, very obviously cartoonish mayhem. The acting can be so hokey and corny, so serious and heavy-handed despite the emptiness of the story. The plot itself is very familiar, and reminiscent of many other superhero films. The romantic scenes of Natalie Portman wearing a gown felt like scenes in a "Star Wars" prequel.But there was that sudden turn around midway in the film when Thor and Loki joined up that the film snapped into place and never looked back up to the very end. The second half came alive because of its quirky sense of humor. These boisterous moments were largely due to the characters of the eccentric Dr. Eric Selvig (Stellan Skarsg?rd), Jane's cute intern Darcy (Kat Dennings), and Darcy's own dorky intern Ian (Jonathan Howard). I feel these funny moments saved this film from wallowing in self-seriousness. They may seem so out of place, yet they were still so laugh-out-loud hilarious.However, are these funny scenes really what director Alan Taylor wants us to remember this movie for? The brotherly interaction between Thor and Loki should have been the main focus, but this can be buried under so many other less-important computer-generated details that tend to overwhelm this production. In any case, overall, this film turned out very entertaining superhero action film that audiences will enjoy. You may not really be able to fully understand how the fight action went from realm to realm in the climactic battle but these were exhilarating to see. The artwork in stark red and black with broad brush strokes over the final credits were awesome to look at. Don't leave right away as you know there will be extra scenes to whet your appetite for more adventures to come. 7/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Comparing with the last movie, this movie is far better, because they are deeper, logical, the story is far better.The humor factors has decreased slightly compared to other Marvel movies. i thought that movies of Marvel are always funny, humor but for this movie, they have put seriousness and darkness on this,making this movie more that just an action, fighting blockbuster. Although i kindly didn't like it since i prefer more humor. For other movies like Iron Man, you laugh most of the time. But for this movie, there are many silent moments in the cinema. Its not only about fighting, war,power...its also about love and lost. What you saw in the trial and what you thought is not what this movie about. I am sure you will be surprised when watching this movie. Just go and watch this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Thor: The Dark World - What's coming from the sequel of the epic movie of Thor? Awesomeness! I am already excited for the movie to hit the theater, now I am extremely thrilled once watching it. I think it was more into the movie itself than what to do with the prequel of it, or even The Avengers Movie. I mean, it certainly can be enjoyable enough even if you didn't watch any of the other two movies. I am a big fan of Loki, and that would certainly escalated even much better after seeing his stunning tricks in this movie. Believe me, you would be too. I think it was a solid story plus actions in it. More than just entertained by the hilarious scenes that keep on flashing upon the screen, the Max of 2 Broke Girls (Kat Dennings) sprinkled more dusty jokes that would make you laugh. I am a big fan of Marvel Avengers Game on Facebook too, which help me love this movie so much more with all those characters such Sif, and not to mention its newly Special Ops 14. And if you're a fan of Chuck, the Zachary Levi played quite a role in this movie as well. I can't explain how much I love this movie, unless you watch it yourself. As for me, it deserves a super straight full stars in a role!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The God of Thunder strikes again.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Thor was not the easiest hero for Marvel to bring to the big screen. His mythical roots and overwhelming power never made him the most popular character out there. That all changed with 2011's Thor, and even more so in The Avengers. Now, Thor is back again, and this solo run is some of the best we've seen from the God of Thunder.As the second entry in Phase 2 of Marvel's Cinematic Universe (MCU), Thor: The Dark World is restricted to telling a story that will fit into the MCU, but that doesn't hold back the story one bit in this solo adventure. In fact, in ways you don't fully see until the very end, this movie undoubtedly pushes the entire MCU forward in high gear. The plot focuses around the Aether,an ancient weapon hidden by Asgardians thousands of years ago from a race of Dark Elves and their leader Malekith, who has since returned in pursuit of the Aether and Thor must stop him from consuming the universe in darkness. The plot is interesting and involving, keeping a solid pace and providing some twists, turns and plenty of solid humor throughout the whole film. The Nine Realms was not expanded on as much as I had hoped, giving a lesser sense to the greater cosmos that exist in Thor's universe, but the film's scale still feels large enough to satisfy.Yet even more entertaining than the main plot, is the subplot created between Thor and his fan favorite brother Loki, now a prisoner of Asgard. This subplot almost takes the form of a villain redemption arc, and it is stellar to say the least. At many points in the film, it almost seemed as though Loki was the star of the show.With each new release in the MCU comes an expectation for high-level action scenes and breathtaking CGI. The Dark World succeeds in deliveringboth of these to the movie, and in top form as well. Large scale battles with ancient sci-fi tech make for some wonderful CGI and wildly entertaining action sequences. Thor himself is not under powered nor is he over-powered, thus creating a hero who is a blast to watch in action, but also has his short comings against a powerful enemy. All in all, the action lives up to the expectations you'd expect from a MCU flick.The aforementioned enemy is Malekith, and along side him his army of Dark Elves and the powerful, Hulk-like Kursed who provides Thor with a re-incarnation of his Avengers tilt with the Green machine. Malekith, played by Christopher Eccleston, is a great villain, dark and evil. However, he was unfortunately underdeveloped, as many MCU seem to be, not getting the chance to really evolve into a movie-changing baddie. Nonetheless, Malekith and his evil forces are enough to bring one of the better villains we've seen thus far in the MCU.The vast majority of the cast from the first Thor returns for the sequel, and they all return in better form. Chris Hemsworth still proves that he his the perfect man to play Thor, while the supporting cast is very strong. Tom Hiddleston once again puts on a performance that captures him the essence of a lead role, cementing himself as one of the best characters in the MCU. Natalie Portman returns to portray love interest Jane Foster while Anthony Hopkins provides some star power as Odin. These names are just a few that have important roles in the movie, and the wonderful performance by the cast gives the characters depth, and in turn are exciting to watch.Since 2008, the Marvel Cinematic Universe has been pumping out pure entertainment for hardcore and casual fans alike. There's no denying that the film has some problems with a lack of some character development, and sporadic instances of feeling too small, but Thor: The Dark World continues on Marvel's triumphant path by delivering a fun, flashy and entertaining movie with grade A acting and action plentiful enough to keep the movie from ever reaching a dull moment. With a mid-credits scene that teases some potentially major plans for the MCU, this terrific Phase 2 entry seems to be just the beginning for what's to come from the ever-growing world of Marvel heroes.8/10</fullReview>

It's a good entertainer Chris Hemsworth does a better job this time around, and with Portman, Hiddleston, and others, all playing their part. So all in all, its a good watch , even for a non marvel fan , I reckon , go for it !!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I must admit, after seeing a mere mediocre Iron Man 3, which was saved by the actors as opposed to delivering an exciting story... I worried for the Marvel Phase 2 as a whole. Thor: The Dark World proved me wrong.Yes, it has its weaknesses. There is a scene where Thor and Loki are walking down the hall; Loki transforms them into a number of different characters. It serves no other purpose then amusing the children - adults will find the scene embarrassingly annoying. When a major character dies, leaving an impact on Thor, Odin and Loki, it felt rushed. And there were too many clues towards the somewhat forced twist at the end, which made the reveal obsolete.Also, it was a little too much of plot convenience that it was Jane who discovered the evil force Macguffin. And Selvig being a little craycray as an aftereffect from the Tessaract makes you wonder how Hawkeye fares these days.Other than that: it was all a great roller coaster ride. Especially the final fight, which was both personal and still had multiple worlds at stake. It also featured really fast paced interdimensional traveling that felt like a more crazy episode of Phineas and Ferb - but due to a good set-up never got you to loose the suspension of disbelief.So, without any (mentionable) spoilers... this is Thor: the Dark World for you. Epic and Awesome...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I absolutely love the character of Loki because there was so much texture to the character. He's the perfect Marvel villain. He was complex but with a tinge of madness mixed in and perfectly written for the film. The rationale for what he does and how he behaves is masterful. I truly loved how Loki was written and portrayed. Then again, I honestly can say that about all the main characters. Thor and Jane really are allowed to shine here as well.My main critique after watching the first film was the instance romance between Jane and Thor. After watching this movie, you buy the love at first sight scenario boosted by the situational intrigue. This time around, the pace of the film really worked well. I can't remember a film that grabs you like they do right off the bat and never lets go but does it with intelligence and heart. Hard to argue any editorial cuts at this point whatever they may have been.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thor 2 Rocks!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The mighty protector of the Nine Realms soars once again in the very first movie made of arguably Marvel Comics' strongest Avenger, the Mighty Thor! Yes, I said "first movie", and this will be expounded on later. Anyway, "The Dark World", besides being an actual Thor film, may also be the greatest "Masters of the Universe" film ever made as well. Watching the beauty of Asgard and the other realms, or the combination of science fiction and fantasy tropes(Elves wielding laser guns! Rocket-powered flying longboats with energy missiles!) reminded me of Eternia and the struggles of its Heroic Warriors versus the Evil Warriors(I prefer the 2000s Masters of the Universe versus the Evil Warriors). In fact, while thoroughly enjoying Marvel's latest cinematic offering, I wished that some movie company would produce a new He-Man film, using "The Dark World" as a springboard.The film revolves around the titular hero(played by Chris Hemsworth) who, after fighting in the Battle Of New York, has returned to his duty as the champion of the Nine Realms, striving for peace between them after the destruction of the Bifrost Bridge in the first film installment. Meanwhile, Jane Foster(Natalie Portman) and Darcy(Kat Dennings) have been searching the Earth for the Thunder God for the last two years, while their companion Dr. Erik Selvig(Stellan Skarsgard), suffering from the effects of Loki's(Tom Hiddleston) mental manipulation in "The Avengers", has seemingly gone "bananaballs", ranting about protecting the Earth in "The Convergence" of the Nine Realms.However, his delusions are justified by the film's main villain, Malekith(Christopher Eccleston), the ruler of the primordial Dark Elves of Svartalfheim, who wants to return the mulitiverse to the darkness that predated creation. Aided by his number two, Algrim(Adewale Akinnuyoe-Agbage), he searches for "The Aether", a liquid-type weapon of pure darkness that he created millennia before to do the horrendous deed. Luckily(or unluckily), the weapon possesses Jane Foster, setting the conflict between Thor and Malekith in motion.And where is Loki in all of this? Well, you would just have to see, now will you?"The Dark World" is an awesome cinematic science fantasy struggle against good and evil, finally giving fans an exploration and expansion on Marvel's version of Teutonic/Norse Mythology. From the desolate blackened crags of Svartalfheim to the gilded spires of Asgard, we finally get to see Thor in his natural element, battling giant stone men, partying with his fellow Asgardians(to a minor degree), and having heart-to-heart talks with his father Odin(Anthony Hopkins) and all-seeing Heimdall(Idris Elba). Thankfully, the references to the Avengers Universe are minor, a detriment, in my opinion, of the first movie.In fact, with the focus being only on Thor, the Thunder God comes across as a character worthy of comparison to the Distinguished Competition's Man of Steel, as powerful, immortal, protector of planets with adventures on global and universal scopes. Close your eyes, and Asgard shares many similarities with Krypton(of course, it would be the other way around, as Asgard predates Krypton by several millennia). As a benefit of this, the film expands on the roles of Thor's supporting cast, including Heimdall, Freya(Rene Russo), and Odin, while adding a new Fandral(Zachery Levi) and shrinking Hogun's(Tadanobu Asano)'s role. Fans also get a chance to see Nine Realm technology, such as the longboats and armed Elves I mentioned beforehand. The humor, one of the only positives of the first movie, is still here as well, whether it is how Darcy gains Jane's attention when she was on a date to how Dr. Selvig dresses when he has to "think".I saw nothing wrong about this film. It is a very entertaining superhero action movie. Beyond Hogun's reduced role, and maybe the glossing over of a love triangle between Lady Sif(Jaime Alexander), Jane, and Thor, this film still gets an A from me. However, as I mentioned before, I consider this the actual FIRST Thor film. The one before it was not a Thor film to me, and is one of the weakest entries in Marvel Studio's library. Why? Because it was more about introducing Thor and Loki for the following "Avengers" film than introducing any of Thor's actual comic mythology. At least "Captain America: The First Avenger" explored his origins and mythology, while telling an awesome superhero yarn. The first "Thor" was more of a by-the-numbers introductory hero chapter, more set-up for "The Avengers" than anything that could stand on its own.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thor Smashes Back with a Great Sequel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Thor: Dark World is a sequel to not only the original Thor but also the Avengers. Thor: Dark World picks up right as avengers finished so Thor is back in Asgard with Loki in tow they imprison him then time passes and Thor has brought order back to the nine realms. But the real story begins when Malekith played by Christopher Eccleston reawakens. They explain his back-story with some quick exposition in the very beginning. He and his ship of dark elves are attempting to awaken and control an ancient artifact so they can plunge the nine realms into eternal darkness. Suffice it to say Thor is not interested in the idea of eternal darkness so he sets about stopping it with the help of an unlikely ally. Now with my assessment of Thor: Dark Worlds Action, Acting, Story, and Visuals. Starting with action now if you have seen the original you know there was minimal action there were about 3-5 action sequences in the whole movie. Thor: Dark World quickly fixes that almost every scene is action packed leading up to a fantastic final fight between Thor and Malekith involving worm holes between the realms. So during the final fight they are tackling and hitting each other through wormholes which was a fantastic way to break up the possible monotony of the standard "THOR SMASH" which is pretty hard to avoid when making a movie about a character whose main weapon is a hammer. So the final fight is definitely something to look forward to incredibly enjoyable and surprisingly funny. Next the acting, it was very solid good performances all around although Tom Hiddleston really stole the show as Loki delightfully smarmy and smart-alecky throwing witty verbal barbs at Thor when ever they share the screen. The back and forth between Hemsworth and Hiddleston is incredibly enjoyable. I feel I must commend the writers for almost all the Marvel comic movies they do a fantastic job inject humor into their movies in a way that feels very natural and rather than distracting from the story in fact add another layer. Story wise the movie is torn straight from the marvel comics I am almost 100% sure 90% of the world had no idea who Malekith the Betrayer was before this movie. Yet they did a great job introducing him and he proved a very worthy adversary for the mighty thunder god. The story followed a fairly standard story arc although there were a few I didn't see that coming moments. Visually this film was incredible the special effects are getting so good now days that you rarely see a big movie with sub par effects. OVERALL Action 5 out of 5 Stars Acting 4 ? out of 5 Stars the half is for Hiddleston Story 3 out of 5 Stars it was pretty standard story line with a few surprises Visuals 4 out of 5 Stars standard visuals good though</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is Thor as it should have been!!! This time the filmmakers didn't fear going all the way with the fantasy aspect of Thor and that paid off big time. The production design of Asgard is spectacular. Alan Taylor is a better fit the Kenneth who could handle the Shakespearean part of Thor but i thought he was lacking in the action department, and what's with all those dutch angles!!! Chris Hemsworth owns the role of Thor and after seeing him in Rush I think that he is not just a movie-star but also a good actor with potentials to be great. As for the other actors, Tom Hiddleston as Loki shines in every scene that he is in, showing amazing emotional depth, especially after one of the movie's many twist. The rest of the cast are well suited for there roles and Kat Dennings is still annoying but cute. The bad guy is somewhat weak in my opinion especially if you consider the fact that he followed Loki as the main villain. In conclusion the movie is very good with amazing action and some genuinely funny moments...and speaking of funny prepare your self for one amazing cameo by an avenger. 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Action, humor, Loki being Loki, Chris Hemsworth took off his shirt for the ladies, and Kat Dennings has officially become my favorite female of the franchise (though I won't watch "Two Broke Girls"). There was a lot of "Star Wars" kinda stuff, but Asgard has usually been described as having technology and medicine beyond our own, so it wasn't hokey. The only thing that I felt was hokey was the after-credits epilogue with The Collector, and considering a high percentage of Marvel movie fans aren't comics readers, it didn't upset most people. For the first time in the new wave of Marvel films it seemed like a cheaply thrown together scene, like a fan-made Star Trek parody, but when you consider how freaking insane the idea of The Collector is in comic book form, this was about as "real" as they could make it. And I believe the director admitted it was a last-minute shoot to get that in before next year's "Guardians of the Galaxy", so while not being impressed, I was not surprised. Overall, highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pure entertainment, but lacks any emotional punch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When the original Thor was released back in 2010, it had everything, gutsy action sequences, humor, heart, you name it, it had it. Thor was a thoroughly enjoyable comic book adaptation. Now, Thor: The Dark World has just been released and while it maintains some awesome action sequences and some humor to keep it going, it does lack some of the emotion that made its predecessor so good. Not by any means is Thor: The Dark World a bad film, quite the contrary, it is a very well made film and features some of the coolest action sequences we've seen in 2013. However, this sequel seems to dwell on the coattails of the original and never seems to fully stand on its own two legs. Featuring one awesome performance from Tom Hiddleston as Loki, the rest of actors seem to fall beneath him and end up being lackluster compared to him. Chris Hemsworth does what he can with the role but there isn't too much more that he could do with the character of Thor that he didn't do in the original, so therefore, I can't fully put him at fault. The rest of the cast ends up being an afterthought when the end credits roll. The biggest failure of Thor: The Dark World is that it tries to best the original by adding more action and less story (something that sequels are infamous for). Now, while the action sequences are undeniably cool and entertaining, there isn't much more to it. The threat doesn't feel real in this outing and that brings the film down from where it could have been. With that being said, the bright side is that the action sequences are so well done and Hiddleston is outstanding as Loki, I can't fully disregard this film. As for the holiday season coming along, Thor: The Dark World is an awesome outing to take the family to. Other than that, it is pure eye candy and there isn't anything wrong with that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A movie is only as good as its bad guy, but Loki isn't the main villain here</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Odinson returns in his second solo venture, more grandiose than the last, but still very close in narrative make-up to its predecessor, despite a change of director. Kenneth Branagh declined the offer to helm this second installment while female director Patty Jenkins was fired early on, at which point Game of Thrones director Alan Taylor took over the reins, and quite successfully so. The Shakespearean overtones are nevertheless kept in, only enlarged by his Martinian experience with grand halls, epic battles and conniving siblings, all too similar in nature to the subject matter so far. After leaving the Avengers and returning home with his captive brother Loki, Thor (Chris Hemsworth more beefed up than ever) has been kept busy for two years fighting rampaging marauders and other dangers to cosmic stability across the Nine Realms. Meanwhile, his human love Jane (Natalie Portman) also hasn't taken time off in search for her divine boytoy by using every scientific means at her disposal. On investigation in Britain, she stumbles upon a portal to another place where she is infected by the Aether, a dangerous, ancient material that is the key energy source of the largely extinct Dark Elves that once battled the Asgardians for dominance in times immemorial, and lost. Sensing the Aether has awoken, the few remaining members of this shadowy race prepare for another shot at universal power grabbing under the leadership of the wrathful Malekith (Christopher Eccleston wearing creepy make-up). When they unexpectedly assault Asgard and kill Thor's mother, the distraught wielder of the powerful hammer Mjölnir disobeys his heavenly father's commands and recruits his untrustworthy brother Loki (an impeccable Tom Hiddleston, again playing the trickster god with the usual vigour that makes him the most fascinating Marvel villain of them all) to defeat the Dark Elves before their nefarious plans for Jane and the universe are brought to their catastrophic conclusion. The only bond that shares them at this point in their overly tumultuous relationship is the mutual love for their mother's memory: otherwise there is no trust or love lost between them. Will Thor manage to save his girlfriend and everything else, without ending with a knife in his back at the hands of his seemingly imbalanced brother, or crushed by the ever stronger Malekith? It will remain to be seen during a bombastic battle in the British capital (instead of set in the States, as has been usual in Marvel movies thus far).The problem audiences might have with Thor: The Dark World is the fact it doesn't dare to leave its established comfort zone and therefore sticks suspiciously close to what we have already seen in the previous film. Though Thor's cosmic portion of the Marvel Universe is certainly expanded in terms of scope and story, thematically speaking there's little to be found that feels new. The nature of heroism, the love for a mortal woman, the rivalry between brothers: it has all been done before, but at least The Dark World doesn't do it badly. In terms of style Asgard has never looked so glorious to behold: a sharp contrast to the dreadful dead soil of the barren world of Svartalfheim that had to be conquered and annihilated for the Norse gods to rise to power ? which makes you rethink how much of 'the good guys' they really claim to be ? as we are told in a fabulous prologue that feels a lot like the opening of a certain Peter Jackson fantasy blockbuster. Apart from the many predictable but entertaining scenes of supernatural action The Dark World provides, also ever present is the level of humour that reminds us we ought not to take any of this too seriously, as well as keeping us from forgetting we're watching a comic book adaptation. Key in this is a reversal of the dynamics between Jane and Thor seen previously, where he was cast out of his world in order to come to terms with a "lesser state" of existence for his own good. This time it's Jane's turn to be a stranger in a strange land as she's swept to Asgard where her Earthly unsophisticatedness causes many a merry moment: not because she's overwhelmed by it all, but due to her impulse to make scientific sense of her new environment, which startles the Asgardian natives somewhat. Those who hoped for more Asgardian style dialogue, as present in the comics, will find themselves disappointed though, as the gods unfortunately speak as much of a contemporary language as our own. Thor and Jane make a decent on-screen couple, but it's the supporting cast that succeeds the most in keeping us engaged, with Hiddleston worthy of most praise. It is often said a movie is only as good as its bad guy, which should have made The Dark World a very good movie, but Loki is forced by the plot to be submissive in terms of villainy to Malekith, despite the fact Loki far exceeds this new villain in being interesting (no criticism on Eccleston's performance it must be stated), mostly thanks to his almost heartfelt loss of his mother, which for a moment makes you think he genuinely wants to help Thor in exacting revenge. And by pulling that off convincingly, Hiddleston again reveals why he was such a good choice for this lovable rogue. Dark or not, it's Loki's world, and we would do well never to underestimate him as everyone else does.And be sure to stick with the credits a while longer to witness a largely unrelated but nevertheless hugely intriguing typical Marvel 'bridge' to next year's Guardians of the Galaxy, which will expand the cosmic corner of the Marvel Cinematic Universe even further. It stars Benicio Del Toro with a funny accent and a silly hairdo, so you have no valid reason to miss out on it, really.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Midgardian Mind Getting Overwhelmed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With the score of Marvel movies out now in essentially the same universe, the directors ask a lot from the viewers. Before seeing this my wife and I watched Thor 1, thinking it would catch us up, but we both forgot about The Avengers, and looked at each other confused when Loki was brought to Odin in handcuffs. We also both had to think about what the characters meant when they talked about a god taking over Selvig's mind... Basically, the movie gives you zero help in remembering why things are the way they are, so I'd recommend watching Thor and Avengers first before checking this out.I loved the way the movie looked and flowed, but there were a lot of "well it's a movie" plot turns, and the plot itself seemed strait out of Start Trek: an alien race is dormant after being conquered and their power source taken away, the power source is found and awakens them, they seek to bring the universe to their status-quo. That being said, the art design was fantastic for the Dark Elves and for Asgard, kudos, and there were some seriously LOL moments that seem to be a trademark for Marvel to keep their movies out of the realism that DC is trying for.It was fun and enjoyable and again Marvels has a winner... but I would stress to the viewer, there is required viewing of at least the Avengers to know what the hell is going on.8 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, I liked it better than I did the first Thor (my problems with the first being that I didn't find the time allowed for redemption believable, and there was a lot of unnecessary CGI.) And i'm a nerd, especially a big Marvel nerd.While it's true that this movie had a little more going on, my main issue was with how rushed the scenes that were supposed to be emotional, poignant and devastating were.The death of Frigga, the "death" of Loki, and the scene where Thor visits Loki are great examples of this. Now, I've read contradictory things on the IMDb message boards with some blaming the director, others, the editors. I don't know who the blame lies with, but not allowing the full emotional impact of this scene to ride out so everyone- in movie and audience could be allowed to feel this was a mistake. Yeah I know that Frigga's tribute is a grand Viking funeral, but this comes after those personal to her are gathered around her. As far as the "death" of Loki is concerned, I just believe extending that scene an extra minute would have been more powerful, especially seeing as he is a major and popular character. The elves looked menacing, and like a force to be reckoned with, sadly there's no dimension to them or any dimension to Malekith. They're the bad guys, and we're given little more to their motivation other than wanting the universe in darkness. Hardly any time is spent on them.I'm still not sold on Natalie Portman as I still think her part could've been played by anybody, but at least she's less frumpy here, and boy, does she know how to slap people in the face, oh boy does she ever. A little too convenient that she find herself the one infected by the Aether out of a planet full of billions, but I guess for the sake of the story i'll buy it.Why does Selvig have no pants? And why is he "crazy"? What drove him to these things, what's the point of it.(What happened to Odin ultimately? Was he killed? was he sent into suspended animation? cast off to a different planet/dimension completely?) Why wouldn't they be gods and immortal? Why would Odin say that? You mean to tell me they can fly, conjure magic, get beaten to a merciless pulp by the Hulk, stabbed, shot with fire balls/flames, hit by cars, endure apparent space travel by falling into the void, and battle with countless entities including but not limited to frost giants, but a mere impaling into the chest would be enough to kill them? or they would simply die after approx. 5,000 years? I felt that line was out of place and unnecessary. Sometimes the CGI was a little overwhelming, and some "landscapes" were awful dark and drab, almost to the point of the darkness interfering with me seeing/understand what was happening.Some of the dialog at times I found corny.Now the great: LOKI. so glad he's a big part of this movie too. I highly anticipated seeing what had become of him post Avengers. Every second he's on screen he steals the show. Loki consistently remains the only one in this series with any dimension, development or understandable motivation. Hiddleston is a great actor and has done an outstanding job, The scenes between him and Thor make the movie.Thor: he's grown on me. It took me a while to warm up to Thor, something that didn't start happening for me until the Avengers. Thankfully he's starting to have a personality, and thinking wisely. And yes, his physique is something to behold! Sif and The Warriors Three: They were great, glad we had the opportunity to see them in action again. It will be interesting to see what happens with Sif.There were lots of little moments sprinkled throughout this film, clever little happenings (ie: Thor hangs the hammer up on the coat hook, the subway, the Captain America cameo.)The end scene was great...people cheered in my showing (including myself), and left for a pretty good Asgard cliffhanger. Also, thank you Del Toro, now i'm psyched for a "Guardians of the Galaxy" movie. Overall not a bad addition, and yes, I'll be buying on Blu-Ray. PS- Studios, yes, give Loki his own movie. But only if you do it right, don't change the character for monetary reasons, and don't take him out of character, you can find some decent script writers who understand what this is all about.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than its predecessor</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I enjoyed the first movie but after watching it thought to myself, "well that wasn't bad, but I wouldn't watch it again". The sequel however, I would watch again. Maybe it's because all these movies that have come after the Avengers are all tied together even more. Regardless, it was a fun movie with plenty of action and humor to go around.But like most people, I would agree that "Loki" is by far the best part of this movie. The acting was fantastic and you get more interested every time he's on screen. The rest of the cast also does a good job as to not take this too seriously but serious enough not to make it laughable.As always, stay past the credits for an extra scene. Although I didn't get it, after reading what it meant online, it seems Marvel have very big plans for their characters. This sequel was better than the first so if you liked the first one, you will definitely like this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I liked it and a good addition to the saga but I thought the first one was better. This one just had something missing.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"It's a different world. Maybe they were different for a reason." Two Years after saving New Mexico, Thor (Hemsworth) still thinks often of Jane (Portman) and vice versa. After receiving familiar signals on her equipment Jane and crew check out the source. What they find not only reunites them with Thor but also endangers Earth, Asgard and the entire universe. Having no other choice they all must unite with the enemy they most despise in order to save everything and everyone. As many of you know by now I am not a huge comic book movie fan. I will say that of the entire Avengers saga the first Thor was my favorite movie. Due to that I had pretty high expectations for this one. I won't say I was disappointed because I did like it but I didn't think it was as good as the first one. They can only do the superhero saving Earth story so many times so with this one they added the threat to Thor's home world as well. Most of the movie takes place on Asgard so that aspect was nice and it did have a fair amount of comedy to keep it entertaining all the way through. There was just something missing in this one that the first one had. I don't know if it was because my expectations for this one were much higher then the original but I didn't have the same enjoyment from this one the other had. All that said though this is a good movie and worth watching, especially to continue the complete story of the saga. Overall, good movie but I didn't think it was as good as first one. As always don't forget to keep watching through the credits...there are two extra scenes! I give it a B.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm pretty sure for those avengers fans won't be missing this movie. I can say the second movie gives more adventure, although sometimes i think this movie contains more comedy rather than the adventure or action that i was expecting. I give this movie a standard 7 because i think it wasn't a bad movie for a sequel, you can see more conflict between love and responsibility, a more mature Thor i can say. But don't forget about Loki which i think has his own attractive side. Thor won't be Thor without Loki. This movie also offers a better visual effects which is a standard progress for sequel movie with lots of visual effects. The minus point of this movie is a more comedy moments which sometimes i think rather disturbing, because the moments doesn't fits perfectly.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first Thor was a fun, entertaining movie, that featured interesting characters and a very interesting story (I simply love myths and legends), along with good acting and a great villain. It wasn't a masterpiece, but nobody should expect too much of a superhero movie: they are all made to entertain with enjoyable sci-fi mumbo jumbo and some fan service for the female public ? which is kind of unusual, since men are the main target audience of superhero movies, and we haven't had any relevant/good female superhero movies recently (or even ever?). But I digress; the important thing here is that the first Thor was good and ? according to the superhero movie rule ? the sequel should have been even better: was it? Thor: The Dark World starts by telling a myth about Dark Elves, their lord Malekith (Christopher Eccleston) and how he wanted to send the whole Universe into darkness by using a strange substance called the Aether, but was defeated by Asgardians. In the present, Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) is still waiting for Thor (Chris Hemsworth) to return after two years, and investigates all anomalies she encounters. Such an anomaly makes her invisible to Heimdall (Idris Elba) for some time, so Thor, worried, comes to take her to Asgard, where they discover that the Aether runs through her veins and is slowly killing her. Chaos ensues as Dark Elves attack Asgard and Thor has to team up with Loki (Tom Hiddleston) to stop them.The first thing that you might notice about this movie is that it is laughably silly, but also very entertaining: it is almost 2 hours long but it doesn't feel like it, and it doesn't bore. Actually, the ending almost feels rushed and I wish it were a bit longer and more developed. Action and non-action scenes alike are entertaining and interesting. But it is very silly: the Dark Elves, the exposition, the story itself ? everything feels as if it was made for really dumb people who, hadn't the movie been so simple, would have flooded the internet with "I don't get it" threads. But still, I found it enjoyable and laughed at the silliness a few times, especially at that one scene ? that goes nowhere ? where we see Thor shirtless, washing his hands and then staring at the distance. It lasts a few seconds and is completely useless ? except for maybe making girls faint/stare in awe. A truly good movie feature is the villain: Malekith is quiet, ruthless, dangerous ? he doesn't joke around, he truly wants to kill everybody.Christopher Eccleston, who plays Malekith, is great (and maybe that's why he never looked good as The Doctor: he's much better at playing villains!), and I want to congratulate him for being able to stand 6 hours of make-up every time to look like Malekith. Tom Hiddleston is simply amazing as Loki, he stole the show and fit his role perfectly. Too bad he got so little screen time, especially considering the other actors. Hemsworth is still good, but Anthony Hopkins and Natalie Portman are just awful. I can understand Portman's horrible performance, since she wanted out of the project (but wasn't allowed) when Patty Jenkins, who should have directed this Thor, dropped out due to creative differences. I still have to find a reason why Hopkins looks so bored and tired the whole time. I sure hope one of them gets a Razzie for Worst Supporting Actor, because they really ruined the movie ? just like the awful green screen in some scenes, which is shameful for a movie that has such a big budget. In conclusion, Thor: The Dark World is an entertaining popcorn flick that could have been better but that you'll enjoy nonetheless.Rating: 7/10 Read more at http://passpopcorn.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thor: The Dark Wolrd - Marvel's Phase Two Indeed Gets Darker</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Imagine what it was like before the solar system existed. Now, imagine what it was like before the universe existed. Before the universe, what was there? According to Norse mythology, before the universe, there was darkness. In Thor: The Dark World, directed by Alan Taylor, Thor (Chris Hemsworth) is forced to fight the darkness that once consumed everything.Two years after Thor's first visit to Earth, and just over a year after The Battle of New York, scientist Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) dreams that one day Thor will fulfill his promise to her and come back. While on a date, Jane's assistant Darcy (Kat Dennings) pulls her away from her date and to a deserted building which housed some sort of portal. After being sucked in by a portal, Jane stumbles upon the aether, a powerful, other worldly element desired by leader of the dark elves, Malekith (Christopher Eccleston), to bring the darkness back to the universe forever. The aether, with a mind of it's own (in a way), attached itself to Jane, now living inside her. When Jane surfaces back in London, she is greeted by Thor, who takes her back to Asgard after realizing something is terribly wrong.Once the aether is awakened, Malekith is also. He learns that the aether is on Asgard, so he strikes. After a bloody battle, Thor is forced to go to the one man in all the nine realms who he trusts the least, his brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston). With Loki free for now, he, Thor, and Jane set out to destroy Malekith and save the nine realms from eternal darkness.Being the second installment of the Marvel Cinematic Universe's Phase Two, Thor: The Dark World does a nice job of getting the story across. The Dark World was miles better than Thor back in 2011, and while it certainly is not the best movie of Phase Two, and only tops a couple movies in Phase One, TDW holds it's ground. Much of the movie was CGI effects, which were spectacular. Also, TDW seemed to go along with the overall plan of Phase Two to go darker, which TDW did both literally and story wise. While some may say that Malekith is a perfectly suitable villain, an argument can be made that he was subpar, and could have been made much more evil. Sprinkled throughout the movie were scenes that could have, and probably should have, been removed. Also, some plot point may be confusing, so be sure to pay close attention.All in all, Thor: The Dark World is a solid movie. Chris Hemsworth gives the best performance he has given as the character. Tom Hiddleston once again shines as Loki, and Natalie Portman does a solid job as Jane Foster. Unfortunately, Stellan Skarsg?rd's Dr. Erik Selvig is ridiculously underused and treated as a joke, which is a shame especially considering the roles he play in Thor and The Avengers. With all this being said, Thor: The Dark World is still a definite must see.Rating: 7 of 10BrickMovieReviews.wordpress.com @BrickFilmReview</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I first saw this movie on opening night I was amazed. Alan Taylor did an outstanding job on this movie. The Visual and Special effects were absolutely breathtaking. The script was incredibly well written with the humour Marvel movies are famous for.I very much enjoyed the character changes in this film. Thor (Chris Hemsworth)changes from arrogant prince to a true hero. Loki (Tom Hiddleston)changes from trickster to a broken hero.The cast in this film did an incredible job, was not disappointed. The battles were epic and well choreographed.This movie contained so many twists and turns that kept me on the edge of my seat the entire time it was playing. I was not disappointed. I feel Marvel did a really fantastic job. The movie deserves more then ten stars.The rest of this review contains spoilers. If you haven't seen this movie yet, please stop reading it.Stan Lee's cameo was hilarious and perfect as usual. Chris Evans' Captain America made a little cameo that I really enjoyed (I was wearing my Captain America sweater when I watched it)."Thor: The Dark World" had a plot twist that was completely unexpected. Loki died. He died a hero and I very much appreciated that. He died protecting his brother, Thor. I cried when watching that part, which I have never done before while watching a movie. Thor's reaction to this big moment was perfect as was Hiddleston's performance. Loki didn't actually die. Of course he didn't, he is the God of Mischief. The ending is what got me. Thor is having a talk with Odin, saying that he cannot be king and asking if he can stay in Midgard(Earth). Odin eventually lets Thor do so, but here is the part where I was stunned by: Thor said thank you and left. Odin was actually Loki and he said "No, thank you." Then the movie just ended and I was sitting in the movie theatre thinking: I have never been Loki'd so many times before.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Marvel has had a fantastic year for movies in 2013. To go off with a bang, Thor: The Dark World was brilliant! I had to go and see it again and again it was just so absorbing, humorous and intriguing. Once again, with no surprise, Tom Hiddleston's performance was amazing. Every time he was on screen I was either laughing or crying. The brotherly bond between Thor and Loki was touching, hilarious and emotional at times. Chris and Tom work so well together, their constant banter as Thor and Loki had the whole cinema cracking up laughing. Kat Dennings, she would have to be another star of the movie as Darcy Lewis, despite the fact that she's not one of the leading characters, she is sarcastic, witty and absolutely hilarious every time she was in view, along with the help of her new intern, 'Ian.'The plot was easy to follow, and you didn't want it to end! Especially after watching the Avengers and the previous Thor movie another thousand times before this one. Definitely a good watch! Humor, love, tragedy and so much more drama. Witness the return of Jane Foster, Thor Odinson, Darcy Lewis, Loki Laufeyson, Erik Selvig and his pants! Don't miss this amazing film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If you didn't like MAN OF STEEL or THE DARK KNIGHT, then this movie might be....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you thought MAN OF STEEL or THE DARK KNIGHT movies were way too serious and earnest, then by all means go see THOR: THE DARK WORLD, which contains more than enough humor, action, and engaging characters to satisfy fans who get what comic books are all about.As a followup to THE AVENGERS, THE DARK WORLD hits it out of the park with epic characters, great special effects, and a plot that could be lifted straight from the best work of Stan Lee and Jack Kirby. It comes in just under two hours, which makes some people complain that the movie felt rushed, is just about right for me.The first order of business for a superhero movie is to get the heroes right; and Chris Hemsworth does nothing if not improve upon his work in the first THOR film and THE AVENGERS. Thor this time around has learned from his experiences in battle and begun to think like a king.The second order of business for a superhero movie is to get the villain right. This time around the Big Bad is Malekith, the leader of the Dark Elves, who wants to wipe out the Asgardians and take the universe back the darkness before creation. He is one of those Marvel tropes: an ageless evil who lives for nothing but revenge. Played by Christopher Eccleston, he's all ugly and grim, while his right hand man is the Kurse, played by Abewale Akinnouye-Agbje, who played Mr. Echo on LOST. Their main weapon of mass destruction and the McGuffin of the story is the Aether, a WMB once hidden away by Thor's grandfather, but now discovered by Jane Foster, the Thunder God's main squeeze. While Malekith and the Kurse are pretty one dimensional, they are more than offset by the glorious return of Tom Hiddleston's Loki, imprisoned on Asgard after the events of THE AVENGERS. He offers his help to his half brother after grief makes them allies-at least for the moment; but we are never sure of his motives and that tension drives every scene Loki is in.The third order of business of a superhero movie is the special effects. And while THOR has plenty of CGI, it does not overwhelm the characters or the story. Certain aspects of the plot clearly were clearly lifted from scriptwriter's's template: there is a battle before the first third is done where the good guys have their butt's kicked and setting things up for a comeback at the climax. For at least the third time this year, we get to see a giant alien space ship lay waste to an Earth city. There's always the pertinent exposition shoehorned into the script, but at least it's not a drag on the story. Lot's of familiar faces are back this time around: Stellan Skarsgard is back as Dr. Selvig, his mind addled after his encounter with Loki in THE AVENGERS, while Kat Dennings's Darcy gets a boyfriend. Natalie Portman's Jane Foster is the perfect match for Hemsworth's Thor. Idris Elba, Ray Stevenson, Jamie Alexander, Tadanobu Asano, and Rene Russo are fellow Asgardians. Anthony Hopkins is grim and grumpy as Odin and following in the steps of Michael Caine and Richard Burton: talented British actors who really liked big paychecks and weren't particular how they earned them. Stan Lee gets his cameo and there's an amusing one by Chris Evans's Captain America. Somehow, Chris O'Dowd turn up as Jane's blind date.There's also a very pertinent cameo by an Academy Award winning actor in one of the after credit sequences; it's worth staying for and sets up the action for films yet to come.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>i would use 4 words for Thor: The Dark World, Fun Fun Fun and Natalie Portman :).Watched it today. I liked Thor 1, it was a Fun, well executed and acted Origin story with the main lead fitting for the role. Chris Hemsworth is a perfect Thor, just like Hugh Jackman is a perfect Wolverine. Chris has totally taken over the role of Thor and made it his own. When you see him on screen he truly is a believable God of Thunder. And when you see an actor embrace a role like that, you automatically enjoy the movie. I was hoping Marvel would improve more in Thor 2 specially after the Blockbuster The Avengers, and boy, they have . The Action and effects in this one is top notch and as big of a scale as they should be, and Marvel also finally realized that they need to show Thor fly (Thanks to Man of Steel :D), and they have with some awesome sequences. No comparison to Man of Steel of course, but still some really awesome scenes, specially in the end. The Final sequence is literally been fought every where, you'll know what i mean when you see it. Special effects this time around are absolutely fabulous, although i am very much disappointed at the use of 3D. Its not utilized to the extent or in a way that you would feel the 3D, if i had a choice i would have preferred it in 2D. As that makes the Action and effects pop out.OK aside from the cool action and visuals, i won't go much in to the story line as always, an overview though. After the Bifrost destroyed since part 1, Thor is busy bringing peace to the 9 realms when an ancient weapon, forged by the king of The Dark Elves, long beaten and forgotten by the Asgardians, is activated accidentally by Jane (Natalie Portman) and The Evil King Awakens with his army. From here onwards the story move forward as Thor needs to protect and save Jane and all 9 realms from this powerful weapon and The Dark Elves. And of course what a Thor movie would be without Loki (The Awesome and charismatic Tom Hiddleston), Thor requires Lokis help, in which again i won't go in to details, and we get to see some awesome scenes with both specially when Thor frees Loki, and you will witness an Awesome Awesome and unsuspected scene in a hall when they are talking . What leads to there alliance, is again you need to see for yourself . and the conclusion to that will make you go WOW....For the last Epic battle, this time around the last action sequence is kind of centered in Greenwich, London, you'll know what i mean when you see it and if you guys are following Marvel Agents of Shield TV series, you should watch Episode 8 "The Well" after watching Thor 2, as it starts, where the final battle ends, u'll enjoy more. I loved every single minute of the last sequence, it had some really really great moments and as much as i want to talk about them here, i can't as it would spoil it for you. It had some cool funny moment as well. And i have to say one thing, i just have to. Last year, Man of Steel was criticized for showing too much destruction and collateral damage, every other person who didn't like the movie was talking about it that they didn't like it coz of that. Well, i think those people who criticized MOS for those specific reason, should stay away from this one and hate this as well , as Marvel has shown some massive destruction in London as well as Asgard and they have shown some major collateral damage as well. Lets see how many people make this ridiculous complaint now. Just Enjoy people, Superman is Alien with super powers, Thor is an Alien/God with Super Powers, what good a movie will be if they don't get to show us what they are capable of, at least this time around, Marvel didn't shy away from these things and actually showed it.Rounding up, i need to mention the Awesome Kat Dennings, every time you see her on screen, she will make you smile if not laugh, she is one funny lady . As good marvel have used Dennings character this time around, they have really miss used Lady Sif, Jamie Alexanders character in this one. Everybody was hoping to see her more in action and Marvel actually promoted it that way as well, but that is not the case, she has almost the same role as in 1.All in all, Thor: The Dark World is an awesome and fun Sequel, there is not a single dull moment in the movie and any person who loves fantasy, scifi and action movies, will love this one as well. It is a worthy sequel, bigger and definitely much better. The only thing i didn't like about the movie was its 3D presentation and the fact they didn't give Lady Sif more screen time, as i was expecting to see her more in action . Oh well, i can settle for seeing Natalie on screen anytime though lol. Another thing which is itching my brain, thats related to Loki, but since it is directly related to the plot, i can't discuss it here. but i really hope that makes sense in the upcoming Marvelverse.Go watch Thor: The Dark World in the cinema. Its Fun and Awesome. Highly recommended.Score 8/10 (it would be 9 for me, but the 3D was disappointing)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Chris Hemsworth again becomes the focus of the Marvel saga. This is a delightful feast for the eyes and a masterful story. I'm an old guy and my tastes run all over the place, but I was taken in from he start As I've said before, people are taking their times with these films, not throwing out some cheap sequel to get a quick buck. Once again the setup is very well done. Loki is in prison in what looks like the city zoo. He rests in squalor, waiting his turn to return to power. He is a master of misdirection and disguise, so we never know when we can trust him. The answer, of course, is never. Still, for me, he is the most engaging of all the characters. He is a perpetual thorn in the side of everyone. He is the incarnation of the true Norse character, the trickster. The plot is really interesting. Ultimately, we must get to earth because all the adventure above the ground becomes a bit distant to us mortals. The researchers, including Natalie Portman's character (who has fallen big time for Thor and he for her), continue to try to figure out a way to understand the workings of this netherworld. An array of fun characters, most carried over from the first film as well as the Avengers, parry and thrust their way. Despite the grave consequences of their actions and those of the gods, there is a great deal of tongue in cheek humor and surprising twists that make it more than a bunch of characters trying to beat each other to a pulp. This is a very engaging film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Literally buries the first film and turns in one of the truly great sci-fi films of the year!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am sort of a wishy washy fan of the Marvel films. So far they have ranged from decent to really good and The Avengers was definitely the height of that and so far the best...until now. It is ironic because I actually thought Thor was one of the weakest of the Marvel films. It didn't really impress me although in watching it again I liked it more the second time. But Thor: The Dark World is simply stunning. Everything about this film works. It absolutely felt like The Avengers and had sort of that same action/comedy blend with a definitive focus on the action and the fantasy elements. Similar to the first most of the film takes place on Asgard or one of the other realms with some time on Earth but there was simply something more astounding about it this time. Superhero angle aside this was an incredible, stand alone science fiction film. There were actually certain aspects of the film that were reminiscent of Star Wars or had the world's feel to it and I mean that as a compliment. This isn't about a guy in tights saving people but rather a mythical warrior and the world around him. The special effects are jaw dropping and the battle scenes absolutely epic in stature.I think I am fast becoming a Chris Hemsworth fan. Earlier this year he blew me away in Ron Howard's Rush and he is truly larger than life as Thor. There is something undeniably charismatic about him and when he dons that Thor outfit with that ridiculous hammer he absolutely embodies the role. He commands the screen with a character who could be very silly and he has really found his groove since the first film. Natalie Portman returns as Thor's love interest. She is okay in the role. I really do like Portman and I think she's a terrific actress but somehow I can't latch onto her Jane Foster character. They have good chemistry and she gets some decent lines but she doesn't seem to be into it as much as she could be. Tom Hiddleston also returns as Loki in sort of an anti-hero capacity forced to work with his brother. Hemsworth and Hiddleston have a terrific chemistry opposite each other and they have emotionally powerful scenes in this that literally almost brought tears to my eyes...almost. Hiddleston is terrific as Loki and has gone back to more of the dark roots rather than the silly maniacal character from The Avengers. Anthony Hopkins is back again as Odin in a slightly bigger role. Who better to play the All Father than Hollywood legend Hopkins. He is terrific and he instantly adds a new level to the cast. Kat Dennings deserves mention in the supporting cast in a much bigger role than the first film. She is the comic relief and she does what she does best with her biting sarcasm. It is almost overused...almost. But instead it is just the right amount and her one liners had me laughing. Other worthwhile mentions in the supporting cast include Rene Russo, Idris Elba (LOVE his character and I think he could support his own film entirely,) Stellan Skarsg?rd and Jaimie Alexander all do exceptionally well. Our villain this time is played by Christopher Eccleston and he is definitely a worthy villain. He certainly looks the part and perhaps my only critique would be that they gave him a little more development and a little more personality.I never really understand how they choose directors. In this case you have Alan Taylor who comes almost entirely out of television to land one of the biggest films of the year. Not that there is anything wrong with that because he made a film that is clearly and definitively superior to the its original. Despite a few references to The Avengers, this is a stand alone movie that anyone can come into and enjoy. The scenery and special effects should be tops at the Oscars because it truly was amazing. I did see it in 3D though (as I always say) it was unnecessary. The special effects are good enough that 3D has nothing to do with it. The story is even better, the characters were amazing and I didn't want it to end when it was all over. It very clearly one of the best films I have seen this year and I was so pleased. Also watch for a great (and amusing) Captain America cameo. I keep thinking Marvel is seriously over-saturating the market with their films but if they keep at this quality than bring it on. 9.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a very enjoyable movie best seen on the big screen so see it while you can.The cast and characters are really good with them being very entertaining in their parts.There is great action but also great comedy at times and the balance between the two is very good.The special effects are obviously very good as well this being a Marvel summer blockbuster. Better than the first Thor I think, but I like the first movie better overall as far as the stories go, the rest is about even.Be sure to stick around after the movie too because during the credits and after the credits there are extra little scenes that you will enjoy. And there will definitely be more sequels to this movie, for sure.</fullReview>

I love Natalie Portman, I've been loving her since her movie V and The black Swan. Thor 2 as all marvels movies it's totally amazing. The story is great. I was a little bit sad in some parts of the movie, but in all the aspects the movie was totally great. If you're a fan of marvels movies you should see this one, you're going to love it.To be honest, in some parts of the movie I was a little bit confuse there are some parts that I didn't understand. One thing for sure, I really enjoyed watching this movie. I want a third part and much more if it is possible. Thor 2, you definitely have to see it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I actually liked the first Thor movie better, but that could be because when I saw the first movie it was in a huge theatre and we got to watch it in 3D which for movies like this adds a lot to the experience. It was great seeing the characters back, there is a lot of good funny moments to go with some really good action scenes. I'm not a huge fan of the comic book character of Thor so I obviously prefer other movies about super heroes but it's still pretty good. I went into the first one with low expectations and really enjoyed that movie a lot, this one I had higher expectations and maybe that's why I thought the movie was really good but not quite great. I would see another Thor movie if and when it comes out, fun and worth seeing for sure, fan of these movies or no you will find stuff to enjoy in them.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Thor is a decent movie that really entertains with eye-popping visuals. The story is limited, but it works for a comic book adaptation. The direction is well done and works with the limited skills available.Tom Hiddleston is the reason to watch this movie. Tom is great as Loki and brings a lot of depth and life to the character. Tom looks like he is having fun with the role and provides the spirit that this movie needs to be successful.Chris Hemsworth is there for the women to look at and that is all. I do not believe that he is a great choice for Thor, but this is who Thor is now in movie land. He grunts, he growls, he acts like a WWF wrestler and has no personality at all. The Hulk has more personality than Hemsworth's version of Thor and he is the reason that this movie does not rise to a 9 or 10. If it were not for Hiddleston; Hemsworth would pull this down to a 6 rating. "Me Thor" "Me Smash" is the kind of stuff that basically comes out of his mouth and he is not very likable.As I mentioned above Hemsworth is not a positive for this movie--except for those looking at his looks instead of his huge inability to act---Asgardian inability. The supporting cast carries this movie: Anthony Hopkins is wonderful as Odin and brings class to this film; Rene Russo does a nice job; Kat Dennings brings some much needed humor and heart to the movie; and Stellan Skarsg?rd makes Erik Selvig such a likable character in the Marvel universe. This is why his character has been in three movies and been successful.Skarsgard and Hiddleston are the true stars of this movie and they steal every scene that they are in.</fullReview>

The whole movie contains good scenes and the characters are terrific, specially Loki and Thor. I think people should go to the Cinema and watch it. They won't regret it. I'll wait for the next Thor film and I hope Marvel doesn't disappoint me. P.s. I think I'm in love with Loki. In my opinion he did an excellent role in the movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Everything Superhero related now pales compared to the Avengers, but I thought it came close to an 8...7.75. If this movie came before Avengers, then it would be a 9, better than Iron Man 2 or 3 easily. Acting superb, story line great with just a touch of seen that already. This has exceptional action, good heart, good sad and a good bad. The humor was about 65% on, but I think the 35% that didn't hit was dry smirking humor, which is good for me. I do think the 2ndary Aasgard fighters or Thor's posse could have been used in the final battle against the other elves and that probably would have made it a 8.5 - 9.0 straight out.The disclosure is that Thor was my 2nd fav superhero growing up behind Spiderman so it would be hard for me not to like it, OVERALL IT WAS A VERY ENTERTAINING MOVIE.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As entertaining as Thor (2011)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Thor, the Prince of Asgard (Chris Hemsworth) is doing his best to protect the Nine Realms of Asgard. When Thor learns of an ancient race, known as the Dark Elves, coming to threaten the Earth, he reunites with astrophysicist Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) and brings her to Asgard so he could go into "The Dark World" save Earth as well as Asgard.Either if you liked or hated 2011's Thor (which I enjoyed, but not as much as the other movies in the Marvel Cinematic Universe), chances are you will enjoy this sequel as much or more than the first one. I, for one, was not expecting it to be better.Chris Hemsworth reprises his role as the Norse prince with the smirk, the wits, the charm, and the power/strength. Tom Hiddleston brings his evil back into his role as Loki, the adopted brother of Thor, who is imprisoned for his attacks on Earth. Anthony Hopkins can play anybody, either as a cannibalistic serial killer or a Norse king, and would still be awesome. Natalie Portman can be charismatic as she is adorable as the love interest to a Norse prince. If there is a weak point, however, it would go to Kat Dennings.Although some scenes can be a bit too silly and the story can contain plot holes, the action sequences and the visuals can make up for that. The result: a wicked good time at the theater.Bring on the sequel to Captain America! 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Comic book movie without much comic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Chris Hemsworth as Thor is passable (definitely better than his Home and Away days). When he is being coy you can see the cheeky Australian come out of him and he is clearly more comfortable in this side of Thor than the tough stoic version. Thor appeared to be missing the old English type of speaking that was in the Avengers or Thor which at times was quite witty. This also means I couldn't walk around the house imitating his old English speech which was disappointing for me. Chris Hemsworth does provide a little bit of eye candy for the ladies (impressive back and shoulder muscles I say), in one scene an actress purposely falls on him just to see if the muscles are real.Tom Hiddleston makes Loki his own. He is broody, depressive, defiant and a smart alec. He pulls all sides off his character, one could say almost perfectly. Hiddleston and Kat Dennings were definitely the two actors who brought the most to this movie in both acting and giving the movie character. Without these two actors I might as well have been watching the Expendables but this time set in space.Natalie Portman was not acting to the quality she has done previously, for example the Black Swan. To me she appeared to be going through the motions or it could be just the depth of the character she was asked to play was quite shallow.Kat Dennings who is the main actor in 2 Broke Girls was a stand out for myself. Every time she walked on stage I think I found myself smiling or having a laugh.Christopher Eccleston whilst being the main "baddie" in this movie is not giving enough depth for you to feel "yes this guy deserves to be beaten and is a real threat to the nine realms". Instead you are left feeling yeah he provides good action scene fodder and special effects. This character needed to be more menacing.Anthony Hopkins and Rene Russo play small but important roles in the movie.The special effects of this movie are very good. There seemed to be scenes where the special effects was the main actor without the need for any human or dark elf actor to step in front of a camera.The movie was directed by Alan Taylor, he has mainly done big TV shows in the past like Game of Thrones and the script was led by one of Marvel Comics main writers Christopher Yost. I feel that sometimes the characters though lacked the depth for some of the big name actors that were obtained for these roles. But if you're in a $300 million movie within 9 days why wouldn't you act in this Marvel studios cash cow.A criticism I have of this movie is that it is following the trend of a 'serious' comic book movie where there seems to be more brooding than fun. Yes the movie has great special effects, good action and drama. Though comic book movies have seemed to forgotten the term comic relief. That is why I enjoyed Tom Hiddleston, Kat Dennings and at times Christopher Hemsworth when they had their moments on not taking themselves too seriously.Other moments I really enjoyed were the cameos of Chris Evans as Captain America and Stan Lee the creator of Marvel Comics.Overall as an adult, Thor: The Dark World was solid with great special effects, some solid performances and other actors going through the motions. I have a feeling that young teenage boys will really enjoy this movie. This movie is a popcorn movie built for the masses and definitely a movie that will not strain your brain. It is slow moving and at times it is appeared the storyline chucked together inefficiently to ensure it fully explains things that are not needed for an action movie. Time wise it goes for almost a full 2 hours.http://mondaysheroes.wordpress.com/thor-the-dark-world/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>MY REVIEW: Thor Lights Up Again!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Thor is charismatic, ideal, no nonsense superhero as evident in his first outing played by Chris Hemsworth. In his awaited return after The Avengers, he takes the legacy further. His loved one is cool Jane Foster played beautifully by talented Natalie Portman. But the most lovable character remains his cunning, clever, cool, likable evil brother Loki played by Tom Hiddleston. In fact he is my second favorite villain after Joker of The Dark Knight in todays superhero universe. Visual effects vary from fantastic to excellent to mind-blowing. Stakes are much higher this time, but movie never tries to take them too seriously. In fact there are lot of funny situations and one liners but this fun was overdone in the messy climax. Nevertheless, it is a fun ride during which you would like to enjoy lots of popcorn. Please note that once movie is over, wait, there will a mid post credit scene to give you a clue for Avengers 2 and one at the very end showing the actual last scene of the movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'THOR: THE DARK WORLD': Four Stars (Out of Five)Chris Hemsworth returns as the titular superhero in this sequel to 2011's hit Marvel Comics adaptation film 'THOR'. It's also the eighth movie in 'The Avengers' Marvel film franchise universe. Tom Hiddleston also returns as Thor's villainous brother Loki, Anthony Hopkins once again plays his father Odin and Natalie Portman returns as his earthling love interest Jane Foster. Idris Elba, Kat Dennings, Jaimie Alexander, Stellan Skarsgard, Ray Stevenson, Tadanobu Asano and Rene Russo all reprise their roles from the original film with newcomers Christopher Eccleston, Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje, Jonathan Howard, Chris O'Dowd and Zachary Levi (now playing Fandral) all joining the cast. In this installment Thor must battle 'Dark Elves' trying to gain control of a powerful weapon known as the Aether, which would send the universe into total darkness. The story is irrelevant; the epic action, visuals and superhero spectacle (that fans expect from a Marvel's 'Avengers' film) is all there! Fans of the original won't be disappointed.Many years ago Odin's father Bor (Tony Curran) defeated the Dark Elves, as they tried to gain control of the Aether and destroy the universe. Bor hid the powerful weapon in a stone column but unknown to him the Dark Elves' leader Malekith (Eccleston), and his surviving followers, hid themselves in suspended animation. In present day Jane Foster (Portman) finds the Aether and is infected by it. When she disappears, for several hours, Thor (Hemsworth) returns to Earth to find her. He brings her back to Asgard with him, so his people can find out what happened to her, but Malekith and his Dark Elves army have awakened and soon attack Asgard looking for Jane and the Aether (once again). Thor must turn to his brother Loki (Hiddleston), who's now locked up for his crimes on Earth, for help. Like with a lot of big action movies (especially superhero films) the plot line is confusing and uninvolving but it doesn't really matter in a film like this. People come to see the characters and action and as long as a film like this is visually stunning and well cast (and some decent dialogue helps as well) then fans will be pleased. I think 'Thor' fans will definitely be pleased with this movie (I was). I'd say the movie is about as good as the original; it's grander in scale and a bit more epic but it also lacks some of the awe that made the first film so entertaining. Fans of the comic book will probably get more of a kick out of it (as they're more likely to follow what's going on and pick up on easter eggs); I have friends that read the 'Thor' comics that have really enjoyed both movies. I don't think it quite lives up to the best comic book films but it is better than most. Hemsworth and Hiddleston are once again both outstanding in their roles and Alan Taylor (the film's new director) does a decent job directing. Portman is once again underused (and she's really above roles like this) and the script (by Christopher Yost, Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely) is pretty routine but the movie still has plenty of what fans are looking for!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://youtu.be/jrx8UNvoGB0</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Accomplishes what it sets out to, which is mostly popcorn-action, plus a few pleasant surprises.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Thor: The Dark World is a movie that doesn't shy away from its genre or source material. For the most part, it is a simple and relatively formulaic plot, couched in well-shot and entertaining action sequences. The context of the fantasy universe works well, again the result of "leaning in" to this quasi-supernatural setting. The other things this movie accomplishes is in developing the characters further, without falling victim to the stagnation that it risked in being a third installment with these characters. We see Thor mature, and place personal sacrifice ahead of the lives of countless people. We see Loki put aside differences for a common goal (however capricious he may be at heart). We also see the differences between Thor and Odin that explains why Thor is a guardian, and not a king.If all you're looking for is a fun, function film that follows and builds on established characters, you've found a good one. If you're looking for something deeply cerebral, or something that goes into the deeper implications of this multi-dimensional existence, look elsewhere. Overall, 8/10 because it accomplished what it set out to, 1 point off because the dark elf masks remind me of the "putties" from the Power Rangers, and 1 point off because ambition was set a touch low in being an archetype of a plot arc.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Marvel Studios movie universe dominates the super-hero movie genre right now. And how have they done it? By NOT making super-hero movies.Stay with me here...Marvel Studios has made it a point to make action-genre movies, that just happen to have their super-heroes in them. Iron Man? Action/sci-fi. Captain America 1? Action/war themed. Cap 2? Action/espionage/political thriller. Guardians of the Galaxy? Action/space opera. Thor 1 and 2? Action/fantasy. The point being, if Thor didn't have "Thor", the Marvel comic character, but just some random big dude with a hammer, the movie still works as an action/fantasy movie. IF YOU KNOW NOTHING ABOUT THE MYTHOLOGY OF THE COMICS, YOU CAN STILL ENJOY THIS MOVIE JUST AS MUCH AS ANYONE. You can't really say that to the same extent when it comes to the Batman or Man of Steel movies. Marvel's got it down to a science, and you gotta give it up to them for that.That being said, let's get into specifics...- "Thor: The Dark World" could have easily been called "Thor: LOKI WILL RULE YOU". Tom Hiddleston, by far and away, steals this movie, and leaves you wanting so much more. Fun fact: A few months ago, they actually called Hiddleston back to the studio to shoot additional scenes with Loki, due to popular demand. And it was well worth it. - Sure, there are other actors in this movie, but really...LOKI.- I think that what Hiddleston is doing with Loki is, at the very least, on par with what Heath Ledger did with The Joker. Of course, Ledger's Joker is at the top of the pile when it comes to movie super-villainy, but Hiddleston is right at that level, and he's doing it with a character that, up until the past couple of years, wasn't nearly as well known. - LOKI.- The scenes without Loki are alright too. Chris Hemsworth makes a good Thor, Idris Elba can do no wrong, Natalie Portman is tolerable, Anthony Hopkins owns Odin, and Kat Dennings is adorable. And they all make great bridges from one Loki scene to the next.- Wait, Loki isn't the main villain here? There's someone else? That's crazy...I didn't really notice that other guy, because LOKI.All jokes aside, this is just a great, well written, fun time at the movies. 3D isn't necessary for this, BUT Marvel sweetened the deal by adding an extended 5+ minute trailer for Captain America 2: The Winter Soldier to the 3D screenings, which includes a pretty great fight scene. So, 2D or 3D is really your call.Thor: The Dark World earns a 4.25 out of 5 on the BDBOS. Well done.STAY THROUGH THE CREDITS!!! There are TWO bonus scenes to stick around for, one halfway through the credits (!), and a 2nd scene at the end.(Hey guys, thanks for reading my review, hope you enjoyed it. If you'd like to see more of my ramblings, check out my humble little page at facebook.com/TheBDBOS.

		<shortDescription>Thor: The Dark World is entertaining and fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>DIRECTION Alan Taylor, mostly known for TV, gets the directors chair for Thor: The Dark World and brings us Thor in some new and fun ways. This version of Thor is much more complex and darker than the first time we met the God of Thunder. The visuals are just as amazing and the main characters get a little more interesting. The camera work is solid, especially when shooting the aerial combat scenes we get. There's also another great shot when we first see Loki and Thor together where Loki is being sarcastic and the camera work almost operates as another character. Not to mention, Taylor throws in some great cameos there. The pacing is very good and there's a great mixture of Thor in action and dialogue that sets up the story. Some of what Taylor is doing can come across off as confusing, especially to new fans but overall what Taylor does is entertaining and fun.Grade: A-SCRIPT The story pretty much picks up right after The Avengers as Thor is now back in his realm making sure that all the realms are at peace. We are introduced to a new alien race that is an old enemy of Asgard. Their secret weapon is eventually found by Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) and all the worlds collide (literally) as Thor and Odin try to find a way save Jane and destroy this secret weapon. At the same time, Loki is now in an Asgard prison because of his actions in The Avengers. However, after an attack on Asgard and a tragic incident, Thor must now rely on Loki to help him destroy the enemy. The conflicts created here are interesting and well explored. Much of the dialogue and scenes between Thor and Loki are very funny and well crafted, showing realistically what a brother-brother relationship looks like, but amongst Gods. The story is also very science-y and is heavy on the dialogue that is sometimes hard to keep up with. The main villain isn't that interesting and isn't explored enough to really care about much. Overall, it's still a fun story and the gripping relationship between Thor and Loki keep it engaging.Grade: B+PERFORMANCES Chris Hemsworth has become a defining character in the Marvel universe and hammers down this character well (see what I did there). He's fantastic as usual and brings a wittiness to the character we haven't see much of yet. His action shots, especially with the Hammer are really good. Portman on the other hand is more hit or miss. The character could be written better but for what she's doing she's okay. Portman really didn't want to reprise this role and it's easy to tell in some scenes but overall brings it when it mattered. Tom Hiddleston is unbelievable as Loki. And by unbelievable, I really mean it's hard to believe how believable he is as that character. He's got all the charm and evilness that makes this a fun character. Anthony Hopkins is also great as Odin. I thought he was fantastic in the first Thor movie and again, he's perfect as the Asgard King. The rest of the supporting cast, including the awesome Idris Elba, is very good even though they have little to do overall.Grade: A-SCORE This is perhaps the best Brian Tyler score yet. Tyler's scores in the past haven't been bad but they haven't been stand out worthy either. Patrick Doyle's score for the first Thor is really good and stands out on it's own very well. Tyler doesn't use the same themes here but the theme he does come out with is very good and brings a good element to the film. It's not too distracting but it's also fun to listen to inside and outside of the movie. Without giving anything away, I do want to mention there's an Alan Silvestri theme that plays out in a cameo appearance that's really awesome. The crossovers have even gone into the scores as well. I love it.Grade: AFINAL THOUGHTS Thor: The Dark World is a great continuation in the Marvel Universe and it's a better direction than Iron Man 3. It's entertaining and the relationship between Thor and Loki is great. It's a good step up from the first film and introduces some new characters. The average fan may have a hard time with this though and some elements are tough to care about but overall it's still very enjoyable. Also, if you see it in 3D, there's some awesome footage you'll see of Captain America: The Winter Soldier.Overall Grade: A-</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm one of the few nerds in this world who wasn't terribly impressed by the first Thor movie. I didn't hate it. I didn't even really dislike it. It was a movie that was just there. A one word rating for it would be meh. When Avengers came out I was pleasantly surprised by how much more entertaining the Thor and Loki characters were. They started to grow on me. While I'm not quite sold on Thor as a stand-alone super hero, I love Loki as a stand-alone villain. I'm going to say it right now and save you some trouble; this movie is very much worth your money! If you stuck around after that last statement, instead of just going out and throwing your money at some teenager with a poor complexion, then let me tell you why this movie is so great. It really breaks down two three things. The first is the Amazing visual effects. Thor: The Dark World is much more in the production style of Avengers, than the first Thor. It had big ambition, big talent, and an even bigger budget. These amazing VFX are only highlighted by some great cinematography, and amazing locations. Iceland (as an alien planet) was the most amazing of them all. The second was the story line. Thor: The Dark World focuses on an agent race of evil elves that are in search of a substance that can destroy all nine realms by throwing them into eternal darkness. While the elves were goofy looking, they made for a formidable foe. I won't lie, the script won't win any awards (except maybe something goofy like an MTV movie award), but it's fun! Fun counts for a lot. The third and final aspect that made this film so great was Tom Hiddleston. The man who plays Loki is an amazing actor, and portrays villianry at near Tim Curry levels. Hiddleston has an amazing career in front of him. Go see "Thor: The Dark World," wait through the credits (there's two stingers), and enjoy the large amounts of fun that is the Marvel universe. You wont regret it, and you'll be prepared for the next Avengers movie. http://watchplayread.com/thor-dark-world-worth-money/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another highly entertaining, action-packed sci-fi fantasy action thriller from Marvel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Thor The Dark World is another highly entertaining, action-packed sci-fi fantasy action thriller with some surprising plot twists and surprises throughout the film. The sequel surpasses the first film for its stunning depiction of the other realms (especially Asgard, which is lacking in the first film). The artistic designs for the costumes, weapons, set designs were nothing short of impressive and visually spectacular.The film has a fine balance of action, humor and emotion. There are more enjoyable action scenes and several emotional scenes involving Loki in this sequel which proved to be better than the first film. The climatic battle and Dark Elves' assault on Asgard were shot brilliantly. There are several interesting cameo appearances which proved to be a delight to the Marvel fans as well. The lead actors managed to deliver charming and heartfelt performances and most of the character interactions in the film were great and handled very well (especially Thor and Loki's constant bicker).However, the film has a rather short running time (a mere 112 mins) considering the number of characters they have included in the film. The characters of Odin, Heimdall, Sif or Frigga are simply not given enough screen time, which is a minor disappointment. The Asgardian army are shown to be too weak considering their ability to invent flying ships or even an Einstein-Rosen bridge (Bifrost Bridge). The main antagonist of the film, Malekith is not shown to be compelling enough or rather generic, his intentions are not fully elaborated and has to rely on two other villains to further the narrative. There are some unnecessary characters and scenes in the film (Notably overly long scenes involving Ian or Richard). Strangely enough, the Dark Elves have their own alien language but the Asgardians don't (they speak English instead).The love triangle between Thor, Sif and Jane was not explored at all in the film.Furthermore, how Thor managed to arrive in New York in The Avengers film is not further explained in this sequel as well(The Bifrost Bridge has been destroyed and it is expected for the sequel to provide a proper explanation...The Avengers film just briefly mentioned that Odin have to find considerable amount of dark matter to get Thor to Earth).Overall, the film still succeeds as a decent entertainment and remain as a wonderful addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe that will not disappoint the fans and satisfy most casual moviegoers.Rating: 8/10Note: As for all Marvel films, be sure to wait for the mid-credit and after-credit scenes.http://yjcool.blogspot.com/2013/11/movie-review-thor-dark-world.html</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Story plot was nothing original. The twists though were very interesting.The CGI was exceptional, great new idea for an intergalactic elvish bomb. The one that would suck you out of thin air and crushed you into a small ball into hell. Some sort of a black hole kinda thing, which disappear after erasing someone from the world.The acting was great, though the human team looked like they were acting for TV shows instead for a movie. But maybe that was what the director intended. Light and entertaining. Especially Darcy and the new intern's interaction, also the newly-turned-crazy Sweden scientist.Portman was as beautiful as ever, but that was all from her performance.Rene Russo was more impressive, an eloquent fighter queen, one that was too fine to watch.The directing though, with the connection between worlds idea, showed how oh-so-Godly the director was.Totally unpredictable. That was how Alan Taylor's imagination was not making sense as ever, yeah, the good guys shall win in the end. How ever too-lucky-to-be-real the process was.The Asgardian team was not exploited as much as in the first Thor, for which I exhaled in relief. I didn't like them being the centre of the story too much. Those characters as a group weren't as interesting as Odin versus Malekith dialogues.The tricks and treats, that was how good I felt the directing and editing was. I felt tricked yet as good as getting a treat. Some of your predictions weren't always turned out right.Go watch it! They said the 3D was showing a great effect as well!</fullReview>

Why couldn't they get this character right?The actor they choose for this role is either physically weak or incongruously unconvincing. The make-up is so superficial.

		<shortDescription>Behold the might of Thor! - Spoilers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What can I say? This film was truly epic. A must watch with phenomenal action sequences and hilarious humour. Positives: 1) Great acting, especially from Tom Hiddleston as Loki, most probably the third best cinematic incarnation of a comic book character, behind Robert Downey Jr's Tony Stark/Iron Man and Hugh Jackman's Wolverine. 2) Just like The Avengers and Iron Man 3, Thor: The Dark World consisted of great humour. 3) CGI. The immense detail used for Asgard, Svartalfheim and so many more locations and objects were incredible! 4) The opening. An awesome flashback of Bor and the Asgardians against Malekith and the Dark Elves. It showed quite a direct narrative in what was happening at the beginning. 5) The ending was exactly what true believers would want. Who would want Loki to die (apart from Erik Selvig and Agent Coulson)? No-one. His apparent death was emotionally meaningful, well to Thor anyway. Before Thor left Asgard to return to Earth, he was telling Odin about Loki's sacrifice and said "Thank You". After Thor left, the image of Odin was actually an illusion! Loki lives saying most probably the best line at the end of a movie where Loki says "No brother, thank you." 6) Cameos. Stan Lee is back! Excelsior! Te legend of comics, the cameo king, he's back! It was hilarious seeing him back on the big screen as he wasn't in The Wolverine or Iron Man 3, well, he was, only in a deleted scene though. But Stan didn't have the best cameo. Everyone thought we'd see Cap again in Winter Soldier, but no. After freeing Loki from prison, Thor and Loki were headed towards a Dark Elf ship, Loki made Thor look like Sif, then, Loki, unexpectedly made himself look like Captain America! Stars and stripes all the way! 7) Frigga kicking some butt. Maybe the funniest and most shocking fight in the film, Frigga almost defeated Malekith with just two knives! Unfortunately for Thor and Loki and Odin and the Asgardians, Frigga met a tragic end. 8) Thor and Mjolnir. Thor and his hammer are ultra epic. You could see Thor jump off a cliff, flip over, catch Mjolnir and fly! Awesome.Negatives: 1) Malekith. He wasn't a big problem, but he was kind of a one dimensional villain. All he practically wanted was the Aether, a deadly source which inserted itself into Jane Foster. Couldn't Malekith been nice and asked politely for the Aether? Maybe that would've been a bit boring. 2) The intern's intern. That's correct. Jane Foster's intern, annoying Darcy Lewis hired an even more annoying intern who just stood around watching the world erupt into chaos and whacking a dark elf with a car. They could have either got rid of him, or put him to good use. 3) The post-credits scenes. I am super hyped up for Guardian's of the Galaxy and the first of the two post-credits scenes introduced to one of the Guardian's main antagonists. The Collector. He did actually look kind of cheesy with his lamb skin coat and purple minions. Seeing Thanos at the end of the Avengers was amazing. Probably the best post-credits scene ever, especially as the Avengers is my favourite film of all time. Seeing The Collector receive the Aether, an infinity stone, didn't feel right for me. I absolutely love Marvel and Infinity is an epic storyline, so couldn't we see Thanos get the Aether? If they were going the Guardians of the Galaxy way, why couldn't we see Rocket Raccoon or Groot pop up? Post-credits seen 2 was worse. It was 45 seconds and 37 seconds of it was spent with a Thor and Jane having the cheesiest kiss ever and then randomly, a monster pops up in London! I was hoping for an Age of Ultron post-credits scene, but hay, we might see that in Winter Soldier or Guardians.Conclusion: Thor: The Dark World was an awesome film, the third best in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, behind Iron Man 1 and The Avengers. Full of laughs and an overall thrilling action-packed epic. Better than the original with great direction by Alan Taylor. 9/10.</fullReview>

Natalie port man was the main part of the film.All the roles were equally distributed in such a way that no one was seen less and no one was given more importance.So if there is anyone who has been reading this review, i have to say just one thing.Shut down whatever you are using and rush to the nearest theater. I am telling u again folks, go watch the movie.N.B:go out of the theater only after you have seen till the end of the credits.Marvel is up with their usual end scenes.</fullReview>

While the subcommittee of its screenplay (5 scribes are attributed) tends to get long-winded in the mythos of the sci-fi fantasy (and a wonky life-force that looks like a spilling of merlot!) the direction by Alan Taylor (and James Gunn, uncredited for the wait-to- the-end-credits-sneak-peak of the next installment) moves along and a sprinkling of humor is welcome amidst the over-the-top digital effects. And once again Hiddleston's Loki gleefully steals the film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK as these movies go it was pretty good. I mean you need to switch off your brain and just watch it. But it was well made, well directed, visually spectacular. And the actors are not bad. Went with my daughter and we enjoyed it, its obvious a lot of work went into the production. its well worth a watch, a lot of action. We saw it in 3D. I think the thor series will run for a while. Thor is essentially Marvel's answer to Superman and, as with The Man of Steel, it can be difficult to craft a tale around a hero who is essentially invincible. Sometimes you can spend hundreds of millions not to get a great movie, they spent a lot of money on this movie, I think it paid off just about. At the end of the day its fantasy fiction, so you have to judge this movie on its artistic approach and its not bad at that level. I have see far worse movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>YES! He's back for a third time on our big screens, but this time things appear to be a bit darker and Thor becomes more desperate for help. I felt the first Thor movie was good, but could of been a lot better as I felt it lacked in the action side of things and concentrated more on humor. The Avengers movie showed more of Thor's strength and abilities but I still felt like he was holding back.The story of the film shows Thor (Chris Hemsworth), making up for Loki's (Tom Hiddleston) mistakes by clearing up the nine rounds 'planets', and shows that he doesn't feel like he belongs anymore and misses his mortal lover, Jane (Natalie Portman). He soon manages to reunite with her, but an evil elf named Malekith returns from the past to destroy everything in his path. Thor soon realizes he cannot do this alone, and takes desperate measures by asking Loki for help but the question is can Thor trust him?This new film is the definition of awesomeness. This time we get to see a lot more action, which is both clever as well as fun. We see the hammer used a lot more and we see more of Thor's strength, which helps to prove that he isn't a god to mess with! Marvel have always been clever with there humor and I feel this film is the funniest so far, yes even better than Iron Man 3! It manages to make you laugh even in the more serious of moments. Christopher Eccleston I felt brought a lot to the role of Malekith, despite the face he was unrecognizable, his voice managed to bring originality as well as the sense of darkness that was needed. In the first movie I felt it was hard to connect with Thor, as he is obviously a God, who is hard to be beaten. However in this film I felt more connected, as you could sense his emotional pain, which is mainly loneliness.If you like action, a good laugh as well as a good story, then please go and see this amazing film! Also look out for the scene after the credits..............Enjoy!(for more reviews go to: http://joshwhitnallfilmreviews.blogspot.co.uk/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The story begins thousands of years ago, when Odin's father (that is to say, Thor's grandfather) led the forces of Asgard in a war against the Dark Elves, who, as their name suggests, were not nice folks. Their leader, Malekith (Christopher Eccleston), had created a superweapon?an otherworldly floating goo called "the Aether"?but he was defeated before he could deploy it. The Asgardians, unable to destroy the Aether, decided instead to "bury it deep where no one can find it." You can probably guess how well that worked out.Flash forward to the present. Thor (Chris Hemsworth) has returned to Asgard, leaving his astrophysicist love-interest, Jane Foster (Natalie Portman), behind on Earth. While searching for a way to contact her interstellar hunk, Jane stumbles into an alternate dimension, where?what are the odds??she comes in contact with the Aether, which enters her body and refuses to leave.

The film does not take itself too serious which is why the story works so well and is such fun to watch. After now three movies Chris Hemsworth and Tom Hiddleston seem to live and breath their characters and Hiddleston once more steals the show as Loki.

		<shortDescription>Technicality finds its happy medium with comic book storytelling</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It has been 2 years since the New York incident and wars are raging all across the nine realms. Asgardian warriors have the onus of restoring order and warding off all evil. Meanwhile back on Earth, Jane Foster has accidentally unleashed an ancient weapon of the Dark Elves that resurrects their race, threatening the very existence of the Universe. The Norse God of Thunder has a mighty force to reckon with and will need the assistance of his deceitful brother Loki. Thor must prevent the world from falling into darkness before the imminent convergence of all realms. With most of the events unfolding upon Asgard, some fantastic special effects were obvious devices to be used by the celebrated TV director Alan Taylor whose most recent works include several memorable episodes of Game of Thrones, Mad Men &amp; Sopranos. 'Thor: The Dark World' is undeniably an exciting superhero epic that outdoes its predecessor and establishes Chris Hemsworth as a worthy Avenger. While the Asgardians police the realms and keep trouble away from their homeland, Thor's ambivalence is highlighted. On one hand, he has a role in protecting Midgard as an Avenger and being closer to Jane Foster and on the other, the responsibility of being the King of Asgard in the near future. As Jane accidentally becomes the host for the dark power Aether on Earth, Thor decides to bring her to Asgard. Darkness then draws onto itself and the resurrected Malekith (Christopher Eccleston ? Who?) attacks the might of Asgard itself causing terror and despair. Thor must now seek the assistance of whom he wouldn't trust at all but retribution, has common enemies. Together with Loki (Tom Hiddleston), Thor must prevent Malekith from unleashing darkness upon the world before the convergence of all nine realms occurs. The common plane of this rare alignment falls in Greenwich, which then serves as the final battleground for an epic clash between Thor and the forces of the Dark Elves. At his third outing as the God of Thunder, Chris Hemsworth is more convincing and iconic than ever before. He effectively manages distinct relationships in this sequel, between his father, his conniving brother and his love, Jane. With more humor, action and evil, Hemsworth does a mighty job with his hammer. Natalie Portman has a better role that is suited to her talent and at Asgard, she feels just at home as she was on Naboo as Queen Amidala. Anthony Hopkins might look weary of playing Old Odin but his voice and persona still make him the most suitable King. The show stealer however, is Tom Hiddleston as Loki. His comic timing and charm simply add to his character's dishonest nature. The untrustworthy Loki is turning out to be the most lovable villain and that simply asserts how well Hiddleston plays the part.Alan Taylor's comprehensive background with major TV series does enable him to blend in several elements of the story in a fast paced, eventful and exciting movie of less than 2 hours. A seemingly uncomplicated plot does yet provide the grip and thrill. With some exemplary visual effects that not only showcase the fantastic realm of Asgard in vivid light and colors but also showcase the epic destruction in Greenwich, Taylor makes remarkable use of technologies to enhance the story's appeal. The best part is, he directs the screenplay in a seamless manner that keeps the audience engaged with the pace so the film isn't heavily reliant on its visuals but is merely aided by it in its storytelling. That is precisely how such superhero movies should be made. The cinematography is excellent even with simple scenes such as Thor's arrival upon Earth, London's aerial view and the action on desolate landscapes of other realms. The background score has the epic tone and sustains the darkness associated with the film's evil. Technicality finds its happy medium with comic book storytelling and Taylor deserves credit for enhancing Thor's presence in the Marvel world. As Malekith's evil grows with the power of Aether, Thor's strength increases with his loved ones around him. His definitive stance for Midgard's well being and for his love, Jane Foster will establish him as an Avenger and protector of all realms. Meanwhile, Loki's wile ways shall keep us entertained with the brilliant Tom Hiddleston. Thor: The Dark World isn't ground-breaking but it does everything right for a superhero movie and that, is the simple reason you should spend that money. Oh, and to watch the scene where Thor sheds his cloak, jumps off the balcony, catches the incoming mjölnir and flies away. Epic.- 8.688 on a scale of 1-10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wonderful performances by Thor, Loki, Jane, Odin and Malekith and the story continues to be charming!! The effects are amazing but the best moments are when Thor and Loki share screen space. Loki has the power to make you empathize with him, but is that just another one of his deceptive tricks? Thor, Loki and whole Norse mythos is as complex as any school of mythology that was formed eons ago in days of old, when magic filled the air. This movie is also about sibling rivalry as well as a long-distance love story with an intergalactic twist. Don't miss this one. Note: You may not like this film if you don't enjoy superhero films.

		<shortDescription>The little girl who loved Thor in "Adventures in Babysitting" (1987)...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My biggest complaint with that great British thespian/director Kenneth Branagh's take on "Thor" (2011) was that its titular character, Thor (Chris Hemsworth), the God of Thunder in Norse mythology reinterpreted as a Marvel Comics superhero, seemed to adjust to life on Earth fairly quickly after being exiled here by his father Odin (Anthony Hopkins) as a lesson in humility.That problem can be forgiven here (since in the grander scheme of things, my overall opinion is hardly consequential to anything), since two years have passed and Thor has spent that time on his home-world of Asgard, rather than on Earth, even though he still longs for his mortal would-be girlfriend Dr. Jane Foster (Natalie Portman), and she for him.And that's one of the things to take away from "Thor: The Dark World" - the resolutions of various relationships - with Alan Taylor replacing Kenneth Branagh (who brought some Shakespearean-styled drama to a superhero movie with the first "Thor") and he takes the series into much darker territory, even though there's still a variety of well-placed humor here to liven things up a little bit; imagine even a smidgen of humor in Christopher Nolan's ultra-serious "Dark Knight" movies - oh, the horror!To be fair, I enjoyed this picture more than I did the first one, if because the changes in the director's chair also resulted in a change of direction into a darker one. So again, Earth is in danger from an other-worldly threat that is beyond human comprehension. The Mighty Thor is forced to not only save our planet, but his own as well, from the genocidal warlord Malekith (Christopher Eccleston), a Dark Elf who sacrificed his entire army to try to defeat Asgard in a thrilling a prologue, only to go into hibernation for 5,000 years so that he could once again try to wipe out Asgard, something that requires the life of the human Jane Foster for him to do.So Thor is forced to do the unthinkable: he must team up with his traitorous adopted brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston, a "Thor" film's best performer, once again), who is now currently imprisoned for his crimes against humanity in "Thor" and "The Avengers" (2012), if they are to save both Earth and Asgard.The focus in "Thor: The Dark World," aside from the various superhero battles, are the relationships - chiefly Thor's romance with the human Jane Foster, and his complicated familial relationships with his parents and of course, Loki, who still vies for the throne of Asgard. And it's also about how Thor must juggle all these if he is to save two worlds from a threat that not even he can defeat all on his own (hence the teaming up with Loki).I enjoyed this movie a lot more than I did "Thor." Here is one of those rare sequels that performed better than its predecessor.9/10</fullReview>

Also we see a much better side of Thor that we didn't see in the first as far as him being a god and what he does now on Asgard.Last is Tom Hiddleston is the man.

		<shortDescription>Go see it!!! A movie review without a lot of spoilers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was a fantastic film and I'm not a big Thor fan. Best action Sci-fi film of the year by far. I saw Man of Steel and this was way better. This film is a lot more diverse than most(if not all) of the films that came out this year. The directing was fantastic, cinematography top notched. Did I mention I wasn't a big Thor fan?One thing to bare in mind. Now, when I went to see this I was expecting a geek fest, but instead it was a girl fest of women who wanted simply to see Chris Hemsworth. So for the die hard comic book fan, just bare in mind there are going to be a lot of young women swooning in the theater. If you think Natalie Portman is sexy, then your in for a treat. No flesh is exposed but you'll get to gaze at that pretty face throughout the film.It's got everything.Love story, family saga, action, some of the best special effects, and even comedy. All the actors were great in this movie, all were very entertaining. Truly a must see. It is worth the price of admission. And yes! Stay after the credits.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>VERY VERY entertaining!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before going to the theater, I expected this to be a great entertaining movie not necessarily better than the first thor, but an entertaining blockbuster, and it was still much better than what I expected! I had a blast ! The action were very entertaining, the universe that the director has made were beautiful. It was also really funny (though some jokes just seem too forced), and the script was also well written. The first 60 minutes was a great build up, and the next 60 minutes were just better, in other words this movie was entertaining from start to finish. This movie's surely on par with Iron Man and even The Avengers (not necessarily better), and without a doubt better than the first Thor. This movie had a lot of flaws, but it doesn't matter since it's so entertaining. It might just be the best superhero movie of the year (though I really liked man of steel).If u either like action movies or superhero movies, you must definitely watch the film. Some people might not like this film because they mostly don't really follow about what's going on or what's happening in the asgard world, if u are one of these people, do yourself a favor and watch this movie for a 2nd time!! It would be much much better if u really know what's going on since the start.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Marvel are everywhere at the moment. In the past two-and-a-half years we've had 'Thor', 'X-Men: First Class', 'Captain America: The First Avenger', 'The Avengers', 'The Amazing Spiderman', 'Iron Man 3', 'The Wolverine' and now, 'Thor: The Dark World'. There are also four more Marvel movies to follow next year ? 'Captain America: The Winter Soldier', 'The Amazing Spiderman 2', 'X-Men: Days of Future Past' and 'Guardians of the Galaxy'. This could seem like overkill, except all of the aforementioned movies already released have been good and some great. Which now brings us to Thor's third big screen outing ? how does it compare to slew of Marvel movies around today? Very favourably.Following the chaotic events that rocked New York in 'The Avengers', Thor (Chris Hemsworth) and Loki (Tom Hiddleston) are back in Asgard, with the latter being imprisoned for his crimes. The Nine Realms appear to be in order, but an ancient race is on a vengeful path ? The Dark Elves, led by the villainous Malekith (Christopher Eccleston). Upon discovering a portal between Asgard and Earth, scientist Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) accidentally reawakens them and they set their sights on Thor's homeworld.In stark contrasts to the recent DC films (except 'Green Lantern', but let's forget that ever happened), Marvel Studios' movies are unadulterated fun. 'Iron Man 3' and 'The Avengers' set the bar high for the level of sheer fun and Thor's latest continues along this path. It's also leaner than every other recent action blockbuster and all the better for it, as e.g. by the time the 30 minute climactic battle in 'Man of Steel' begins, the end credits start rolling on 'Thor: The Dark World'. Additionally, the action sequences are terrific and exhilarating, while the comedy is properly funny and occasionally hilarious. There's also an unexpected cameo from a Marvel regular that is one of the most joyous things I've seen all year. Alan Taylor uses his experience from the brilliant 'Game of Thrones' to great effect when approaching the fantasy worlds. As per usual, Tom Hiddleston is a delight to watch, lighting up the screen whenever he appears, while Hemsworth is efficient and the rest of the cast are solid. There are flaws ? one or two plot strands disappear and some roles are underwritten. However, 'Thor: The Dark World' may not be a profound classic, but it is gloriously entertaining from start to finish and a very worthy addition to the ever-expanding Marvel canon. Also, make sure to stay for the entire ends credits, as we got, not one, but two post-credit sequences, which I won't spoil, but I will say that one of them offers an excitingly weird glimpse into a future Marvel movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>2013's best superhero franchise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have no expectation before watching this movie after a disappointment that 'Iron Man 3' had marked months ago. Unpredictably 'The Dark World' is above what I think it would be. 'Marvel: The Avengers' franchise has never been this much fun since first 'Iron Man'. Alan Taylor as director dares to take risks in storyline and makes it out from comfort zone. Some action scenes are entertaining and sometimes hilarious, especially when Loki involved. Thor character is shown much more development than the previous movie. In 'The Dark World', Thor is described more grown up and more responsible to save Asgard and Earth from villain's threat. Also the studio has succeeded to exploit Thor's power in this movie that doesn't happen in first franchise or in 'The Avengers'. The presence of Malekith has succeeded enough to give good impression as villain. Perhaps there's quite disorganized in plot and some jokes aren't in the right place. Overall, 'Thor: The Dark World' is one of the most memorable superhero movie this year, also great one from 'The Avengers' franchise. The IMAX 3D is worth to watch though.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not spectacular, but still a noteworthy...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>...addition to "The Avengers" canon of films.I recommend this movie if you are any of the below:1) You are a completist and would feel wrong to have missed an installment belonging to the Avengers series of films despite speculating that it is a filler movie made only to grab your money.2)You love to stare at Chris Hemsworth's bulging biceps.3) You love superhero movies, even if its plot is pretty standard with few or no surprises.4) You are single male and have nothing better to do.My gripes with the film may be more of a problem with Hollywood movie-making these days than with the film itself. Production feels uninspired and run of the mill. The plot, props, action, effects and gags are all neatly in place to generate just enough wonder and excitement for the average viewers so they don't fall asleep.During the movie, we are told that there are nine realms, but each one is nothing more than a snow globe when compared to the diversity of Earth. Apparently, in all the other realms, people can travel between dimensions but still fight with swords and axes. Whereas on Earth, we have all manner of weaponry but knows sh*t about the universe save a few super geniuses who like running around strip naked and whatnot.So there you have it.If none of what I've just said sounds like a major turn-off, I will say that this is good entertainment equivalent to regarding an extra value meal at Macdonald's being a good meal sometimes. Otherwise, please do yourself a favor and steer clear of the movie to save yourself from having to cry about it later on the boards.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thor returns to Earth after realizing Jane Foster has found a strange object that is not from Earth</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you are just reading this to know if there's a scene after the credits. There is one so wait for it. Although it wasn't as good as the first one it is still worth seeing if you big on the Marvel movies. It is the best of the post Avengers movies. Well that's not saying much since Iron Man 3 was a bust. Anyway I do enjoy how Marvel studies puts comedy into their films, don't get me wrong I'm all about all action in movies like Dark Knight and Man of Steel, but I have to say this movie mad me laugh pretty hard. I still think Thor should of gotten with Sif she's more beautiful than Jane but that wouldn't make much of a movie. But overall it kinda seemed like just a movie to set up a Thor 3 movie with Loki as the main villain again, but I think we've all seen enough of Loki. I'm a big fan of super heroes so I gave it an 8 but for the average person it's probably a 5. I almost want to say the comedy was the best part, or seeing Rene Rosso beating people up. When I mentioned There was an after credits clip, that clip was very interesting I don't know if that's just for Thor or will that be a setup for avengers 2 maybe even avengers 3 who knows Marvel studies has so much money they are just going crazy with power.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Mighty Avenger returns to the big screen!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Thor is a superhero that is created in 1962 by Stan Lee, Larry Lieber and Jack Kirby and was published by Marvel Comics making his first appearance in Journey into Mystery #83. Stan Lee wanted to create someone stronger than the strongest man so he made a character that is an actual god. Thor became a big hit in Journey into Mystery and was a founding member of The Avengers in 1963, in fact, Loki (Thor's arch- nemesis and his own brother) was not only the first villain the team ever faced, but was also the entire reason bringing the team together in the first place. Alright, now that I got the brief comic book history out of the way, I will now tell you what we think of Thor: The Dark World. Honestly, I think that this is one of the best Marvel Cinematic Universe movies to date and possibly a great superhero movie.The storyline is set after the events of Avengers Assemble with Loki safely locked away in prisons of Asgard and Thor bringing peace to the nine realms which breaked out into chaos in his absence. While searching for Thor, physicist Jane Foster discovers a powerful ancient force which possesses her body and awakens a dark evil which seeks revenge against Asgard and hopes to plunge the universe into darkness. First, let me go into the flaws for starters. Christopher Eccelston (who you all recognize as the ninth incarnation of The Doctor in Doctor Who) really sells his part as Malekith. However, the problem wasn't the casting; it was the amount of screen time Eccelston got. He doesn't get as much screen time as Malekith and it's very unclear as to why he was implying his evil intentions. In simple terms, I guess he just wanted to destroy every life form he opposes but like I stated, there's no intentions as to why he's doing this. Now on to the great achievements. The cast like in the first film were very believable and did a good job at representing their roles. Chris Hemsworth was brilliant as the God of Thunder. His long hair, great build and screen presence makes him look the part. It's clear that Hemsworth hasn't read any of the Journey Into Mystery or The Mighty Thor comic books but even if he hasn't read both series, he still gives a great performance. Tom Hiddleston as Loki was breath-taking and I'm sure that the fan service for this particular comic book character will agree with me. Tom Hiddleston is clearly loved by every single human being after his portrayal of Loki on Avengers Assemble and in this case, he isn't any different. He's still the God of Mischief; he's one of the most compelling comic book characters in this film and is one of the most complex. I especially loved the interactions between him and Hemsworth; When Thor says that he doesn't trust him anymore; you can see something die in Loki's Eyes. For a second, he seems so lost and vulnerable, but then he puts the mask back on. Natalie Portman as Jane Foster was actually not that bad in this case. She feels more fleshed out than she did in the original film and actually is connected to plot. The same thing applies to Sif and the warriors three and even Frigga has a great moment. And Heimdall?I don't even need to describe on how badass his voice was. Anthony Hopkins plays Odin which is Thor's father and he sells the part pretty well. You can tell why Odin is king and does have a plan and a reason for everything he does. Basically, every single character gets a moment to shine and every single actor cast in these parts are perfect. The comedic moments fit in perfectly with various environments and are very subtle. I heard some people had problems with the comedic moments and I don't see any flaws with them whatsoever. The action sequences were absolutely breath-taking as with the special effects. The final battle clearly extends the underground, skies and even different universes simultaneously. The direction was also unbelievable and this was not only due to Alan Taylor's direction, Joss Whedon was also involved in some directions and actually assisted Taylor when he needed it. (clearly, someone needs to give Whedon a medal) The set pieces and the other nine realms talked about in the first film are seen in this particular film and are beautiful. The location of Asgard was even better believe it or not.As a big fan of Marvel comic books, it's great to see Malekith (despite his different appearance and how the character came to be) and Kurse hit the big screen. Actually, let me talk about Kurse for a brief moment seeing as no one really mentioned him that much in various reviews. In your case, you may say that Kurse can be just as intimating as the Hulk in terms of scary power. In conclusion, he's an overall badass. The theme of this movie was really dark and it really shows here. While it can have hilarious moments at times, it's still a brave movie with possibly the darkest moments in Marvel Cinematic History. In conclusion, besides the confusing evil intentions from the main villain, Thor: The Dark World certainly is a brilliant blockbuster. It has a unique cast, superb soundtrack, outstanding action sequences and special effects, the storyline is good and the direction was simply amazing. This film definitely deserves a 9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just A Blast! I Just Loved This Film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Thor works on so many levels. It meets its toughest challenge and that is to make its super powerful blond godlike lead character relatable and spark a connection to the audience. For all the action extravagance and adventure, a surprising connection occurs here. This certainly isn't some wild video game popcron flick. It also packs the perfect amount of comedy and connection. It's what Marvel does best, give us heroes with flaws.A lot of this film takes place hopping across realms and that was absolutely the right way to present the film. The fantastical elements really work. Asgard is breathtaking and incredible. They manage to be dramatic and serious most of the time but balance it with a sense of humor. Thor finds the right mix similar to the way Avengers did. The film never becomes too self-important or portentous but still is dramatic and fun. That is something to savor and enjoy. Sure, viewers are thrilled by his powers, but we relate to his emotions and his flaws. Add some intense sibling rivalry, great action and romantic entanglements and Thor may just be the best movie of the year.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>We are thrust once again into the world of the Marvel Cinematic Universe and fully into the realm of Asgard with the sequel to 2011's Thor, a film that is unashamed of it mash up of fantasy and sci-fi.Thousands of years ago, the Dark Elves, led by Malekith the Accursed (Christopher Eccleston) tried to bring the universe back to a state of darkness, with a weapon known as the Aether, during a rare alignment of all the Nine Realms. But Malekith is stopped by Bor (Tony Curran) and the armies of Asgard.After the events of The Avengers, Loki has been taken to the prisons of Asgard, only to avoid a death sentence by the grace of his mother, Frigga (Rene Russo) as Thor (Chris Hemsworth) and his friends try to bring peace to the Nine Realms. Soon, Thor is drawn back to Earth when Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) makes a discovery of a strange an anomaly in London. Thor takes Jane to Asgard where the realm the Dark Elves attack with the fabric of reality at stake.The filmmakers of Thor: The Dark World go for the approach that bigger is better. There is more action, larger stakes, lots of fantasy and plenty of battles. TV director Alan Taylor, best known for his work on Game of Thrones shows great confidence with transition to film. The action is bigger and a improvement upon the first film, getting massive battles and fights and more regular. Audiences can easily geek out as it blends medieval weaponry, magic and laser battles.Thor: The Dark World goes the whole hog with its blend of sci-fi and fantasy, from a Lord of the Rings style opening, the gravity anomaly in London looking like something from a Doctor Who episode and the use of spaceships. It is a film that is completely unashamed about its comic book origins and 10-year-old boys and the 10-year-old inside all of us will love it.The events on Earth and Asgard are juxtaposed by two different styles. The action in Asgard is treated seriously with the full embraced of the fantasy, whilst the Earth scenes are much more light hearted. Kat Dennings continues to be the comic relief and this time she has comedy with her own intern played by Jonathan Howard and Stellan Skarsg?rd's Dr Selvig is relegated to running around Stonehenge naked and being locked into mental hospital.Taylor does put his stamp all over Thor: The Dark World, making a visually darker film by using dark cinematography and the art direction for Asgard is clearly influenced by Game of Thrones. Asgard has more of grounded medieval look in Thor: The Dark World then the grand look of Kenneth Branagh's film.Thor: The Dark World is a strong continuation of the Thor series and this is illustrated with the relationship between Thor and Loki. The characters have learned from each other and their experience and the relationship has evolved into one of banter between the brothers. Loki continues to be the most interesting villain in the Marvel Cinematic Universe and shows growth with his tragedy and pain.Former Doctor Who star Christopher Eccleston took on the villain and he does the job well, giving a professional performance as Malekith, He may not have the depth of Loki and his motivations are stock, but he does a great job. Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje and his large stature as Kurse gave Thor a big physical challenge that he needed and leads to a massive fight.Thor: The Dark World is far from deep or meaningful, but it's a fun ride and an entertaining fantasy adventure that raises improves on the action level and strong follow-up to the series.Please visit www.entertainmentfuse.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best marvel movie to date(except iron man and including avengers).</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you thought that avengers was good, you will be pleasantly surprised with Thor:the dark world. This movie plays tricks that the first set of marvel movies never did. This takes brave steps that change Thor's life and makes you wonder through the rest of the movie what more steps are made. The villain, although very distant to the characters and not as personal as Loki is, Christopher Ecclestone is still a brilliant actor and has a very evil vibe when he plays the role of the evil Dark Elf leader. Overall this is a masterpiece for marvel as I have seen marvel's movies as nothing special until now(accept for iron man). So I recommend watching Thor: The Dark World as it has an epic cliffhanger and gets you really excited for the next step in marvel's movie franchise.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Thor: The Dark World is an ideal example of how a super-hero sequel should be done, it steps up the action, the emotions and the stakes.Thor 1 was a good super-hero film it was the minimum it should be but Dark World steps it up a notch it has an excellent story showing more of the Asguardian universe than ever before. It, like Iron Man 3(which i personally didn't like), shows the affects the Avengers had on the hero and their supporting characters.Now when I saw Loki in the trailer I thought that he wouldn't play any part at all in the story and he was only there to bank in on his likability but I was wrong he does belong in the film and wouldn't be right without him.I would recommend seeing this film massively to anybody who loves adventure (my second favorite Marvel film after the avengers)P.S Christopher Eccelston, yet again, makes an excellent villain.P.P.S If you do go and see it heads up there is 2 after credit sequences so make sure you sit through ALL of it</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An amusing and simply a better sequel.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While it possesses a predictably uninspiring plot almost every superhero movies use, Thor: The Dark World manages to be entertaining due to its clever script, great chemistry between the cast and amazing visual presentation. It improves on the original with larger action sequences and smoother, more appealing and more elegant scenes. At heart, the relationships between characters are amusing to watch, especially the dysfunction brotherhood of Thor and Loki, much to Tom Hiddleston's credit.It opens up slightly plain with monologue explanation of a banished ancient race that made an ominous weapon, was defeated in way and ultimately swore vengeance upon Asgard, which harrowingly feels all too similar to Superman's nemesis, amongst others. It then reintroduces the characters and how they fare after the events from the first movie. With Thor's concern over his duty and longing for Jane, the first half is a bit mundane. It does gradually become much more compelling with good acting and light yet efficient humor. Dialogues are funny, presented at timely occasions and don't feel forced. There lies sincere playful moments; more than most movies of its kind has to offer.Acting from the cast is charming. Chris Hemsworth seems more comfortable as Thor. He shows a fairly natural performance and it coincides well as the character itself becomes more mature. Natalie Portman as Jane is decent, but she's still somewhat trapped in the damsel in distress role. Tom Hiddleston performs wonderfully as Loki, still looking mighty treacherous but has a hint of redemption this time around. It's good to see both brothers interact with each other as that is one of the best moments of the movie.As expected from a blockbuster movie, it delivers quite well on its depiction of alien worlds intertwined with Earth. Asgard has abundance of tiny details, from its gadgetry, garment to mishmash of traditional Viking and futuristic housing. Color palette has changed from the first's dusky set of New Mexico to more cloudy grayish skyline of London. Nifty spectacles are spread throughout, battles are fought exotically and the clash of colors is enchanting. Its 3D effect has reasonably vivid impact, it won't impede the visual, in fact adds to the enjoyment.Thor: The Dark World is simply a better sequel. The plot might be generic, but its genuine humor, good acting and delightful graphic ensure an enjoyable lighthearted watch. As it stands now, it's one of the better action fantasy movies of recent time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So a year on since the Avengers assembled and Loki has been in prison while Thor is making peace in the Nine Realms while the Bifrost was being rebuilt. So after all that is explained in the first 10 minutes we get to the story line which revolves around a Dark Elf known as Malekith and his search/revenge plans. Christopher Eccleston did a very interesting role although after watching I think he didn't own it, other people could have done it as well, if not better. That didn't ruin it though as another, unexpected, plot point revolves around Loki and the issues of trusting him which make for some very twisty and questionable scenes. I'd have to say I enjoyed the parts set on Earth more rather than in space for some reason, but all in all I liked how it looked although some elements I had seen before in other media. There were of course references to past films as the Tesseract got a mention as did New York. So my final thoughts are this: the special effects were great, the plot was OK but I've seen better, and all-in-all I have the same feel about it as the first, it didn't wow me but neither was I bored, it was just in the middle.</fullReview>

Throughout the film we have a load of jokes and acceptable contrapartes , the mythology is explored very well in the movie as references to various occasions , the special effects are excellent , the soundtrack is good and demonstrates a balance between action of the moment. The film has problems like lack of direction in relation to the romance between Thor and Jane Foster and causes get stressed enough , in the final moments of the film lacks a bit of understanding . and we also have references to the Marvel universe , and stay until the end because there is 2 scenes after credits ; Thor : The Dark World is a great movie and one of the best ever made by Marvel Studios , is well worth watching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's been a year since the events of The Avengers. Bifrost has been rebuilt, and the Aesir are only now done world policing the other realms back to peace. Things won't remain quiet for long - a primeval race, the Dark Elves, return, determined to bring all of existence back to the nothingness before there was light. An oft-used, abstract "villain goal" - here visualized well, and made quite literal; part of their arsenal(the only advanced weapon in this that isn't so bland that it's downright distracting) is a grenade that creates a tiny black hole, relentlessly pulling away those caught within the blast radius. To this end, the leader Malekith(Eccleston bringing out the big guns for the least compelling bad guy of the current cinematic Marvel-verse), with the aid of his lieutenant, Algrim(Akinnuoye-Agbaje, using his immense physical presence to bring a seemingly unstoppable force of destruction to life - a lava-infused bull-like being), seek the Aether, a powerful essence that enables the wielder to drain life and light.It has recently resurfaced - in fact, it infected Jane Foster(Portman, cute in her awkward social behavior and obsession with discovery; she and our titular hero are pining for one another - with that said, the romance was better in the first one). This makes her a target, and the Asgardians find that their old foe is extremely dangerous. The only way to save the universe(can you say "raised stakes"?) appears to be for Thor(Hemsworth, charming, strong and, yes, arrogant - but now with an appreciation of planning and not rushing in) forming an uneasy alliance with Loki(Hiddleston at his most duplicitous, unpredictable... and vulnerable; in short, his best yet), who now faces consequences for his actions, and the two will come head to head over their on-going conflict - in general, this takes care to follow up on what has happened to these characters(in part by trimming the large cast some, not introducing many new faces, and, yes, less overall development for them) so far, a surprisingly personal story in this adventure of an epic scale.As this flies by with a pace that never overwhelms in spite of opening the until-now-only-ajar door to the vastness of space, the comic relief jokes and gags come in a steady stream, with the "Terminator 2" style humor - easing the otherwise heavy and bleak subjects, without becoming, well, T3, a parody. There is a ton of action(another of the many improvements on the great Branagh film), and it's much more varied - not merely(which doesn't mean they're gone) deities fighting creatures, we now have mid-air combat, jet fighters, chase sequences, even a major attack on a fortress! Aiming for Star Wars, this shows us more of the galaxy, defining the various areas as unique from one another. The grand orchestral score aids this tremendously, as does location shooting, solid FX work including prosthetics - with practical, suits and the like favored over CG. We go on an adventure - away from that which is familiar to either us or the protagonists. The plot is easy to follow, yet with good twists, and everything is properly set up and pays off.There is a lot of disturbing content, some mild violence and a little moderate language in this. I recommend this to any fan of fantasy, graphic novels and/or Nordic mythology. 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Thor the Dark World is a total revolution from the first movie. The one thing i noticed though, throughout Thor, Avengers and Thor 2, his hair gets longer every time (which i'm not complaining). The movie was full of action, which fulfills the audience as they walk out of the theater. On the other hand, comedy took place in many parts throughout the movie. What is more interesting is that most of the comedy was performed by Loki, who everybody knows as a major Marvel Villain besides Dr. Doom and Thanos. The comedy, in my opinion, was there because the success of the Avengers, which had many comedy scenes in it, made this movie likable. This movie totally fixed the things that miss from the first Thor. There were many scenes where they introduced Thor's ability to performed his power in certain ways that no one had ever seen before. The connection of Thor and the people of Asgard and his family was portrayed really well by their language, joke and style of speech. The music was an epic score. It really defined the story and I still could not get it out of my head. It's not as memorable as Pirates of the Caribbean but it definitely built the excitement watching the movie. Everybody must go see it. It's well thought and the story and action really defined Thor. Go see go see!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wow.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off, I have to say that I went charging into the movie theater not having a clue what this movie was going to be about. I wanted to see it because Thor is my favorite Marvel series, and I didn't have any expectations set besides hoping this Thor would have a lot less romance than the last Thor and that the movie would spend most of its time anywhere but Earth. I was pleasantly surprised. Most of the movie took place on Asgard and other planets. Of course there was romance, but I felt like it had its place and didn't interfere with the plot. Darcy and Ian's little romance was lighthearted enough that it was enjoyable to see. After Jane was taken to Asgard, my biggest fear was that she was going to somehow end up immortal by the end of the movie so she could live with Thor, since Odin had brought up several comments on how Jane's life would be over in a flash compared to Thor's. While the bit about the "the entire universe hangs in the balance" is so old it has mold growing on it, I liked how the movie didn't end right after the Aether was extracted from Jane. To me, this gave more strength towards Thor's character flaw. He created an elaborate plan just to get Jane off of Asgard and even chose to work with Loki, yet he still failed and Loki (seemingly, at the time) paid with his life. I felt that Malekith should have been elaborated on more; he would have been a more interesting character if we knew who he was and why exactly he wanted to commit evil deeds. Besides this, the movie was fantastic. Although Kurse was a bit hard to take seriously because his helmet-thing bore close resemblance to a warthog in my eyes. The music fit well with the scenes, the deaths and Loki's supposed death were emotional enough for me (although I felt like Thor's reaction towards his brother's death was rushed; he and Jane took off after Thor watched Loki die in his arms). Loki's humor was brilliant, although I don't quite understand why we had to keep watching Erik running around nude on the television ? we saw it once and I think once got the point across well enough. I thought the funeral scene was beautiful and emotional at the same time, and I can never get enough of Asgard's night sky. I also liked how Heimdall was given more of a part in this movie; he's a cool character who didn't get enough screen time in the original Thor. I also happened to see this movie in 3D and I'm a person who wears glasses and does not own contacts, so I usually resent going to see movies in 3D, but this movie was so worth it and I would actually go to a 3D showing again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the better entries in the Marvel series</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Thor: The Dark World is the next entry in the high quality series of Marvel movies over the 7 years or so and it is one of the best. Its funny, its got action. And did I mention its funny? Honestly, I think this movie had more sarcastic comments, wise cracks per minute than it did hammer punches to the face.Story is fairly generic. Super evil guy thought long dead wants super evil thing. Thor and crew doesn't want him to get it. It's straighforward enough. However, for a movie titled Thor, it sure does spend a large amount of screen time with other people, Natalie Portman, the other scientists when Natalie Portman is in Viking Land, Loki, the bad guy, Loki again. Actually, I don't really mind the Loki part. I hate him as a character, but he is fascinating. He truly is the god of mischief, you never know what side he is on, though usually its his own side. I don't understand how anybody trusts him ever.Every character always has something funny to say. Every side character is comic relief, and Thor is pretty funny himself too. With so much casual comedy all the time, the incredibly sad and dramatic moments create a jarring tonal shift. Then after a short while its back to jokejokejoke. For most of the movie, the action isn't that mind blowing or fascinating. But the movie makes up for it with the final fight, full of chaos-inducing wobbly gravity and warping all over the place.tl;dr a fun, entertaining super hero movie, with jarring tonal shifts, but one of the most fun final action sequences.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Thor, the Mighty Avenger, returns in his third outing in as many years. His latest installment derives plot strands from Thor and also deals with the residual effect of Avengers Assemble.With Loki imprisoned in the dungeons of Asgard, Thor strives along with his loyal comrades Lady Sif and the Warriors Three to maintain equilibrium across the nine realms. However, unbeknownst to Asgard, an old nemesis resurfaces in the form of the dark elves. Circumstances dictate Thor to forge an unlikely alliance with the captive Loki, in order to prevent an impending cataclysm.Directing duties change hands from Kenneth Branagh to Alan Taylor. A television veteran, Taylor has experience with shows such as Lost, The Sopranos and recently, Game of Thrones. It is that background which serves him well in this instance.He excels in making personalities with demi-god status more relatable, both in triumph and loss. All things affiliated with Asgard exhibits more authenticity. Furthermore, the characters are grounded in reality and the sequel delves deeper into the intricate relationships between characters than its predecessor.Chris Hemsworth is an admirable physical and emotional embodiment of the Norse deity. Tom Hiddleston is able to delineate grey shades in another accomplished performance as the nefarious Loki. While the latter may garner plaudits for his portrayal, Hemsworth shines as the eponymous warrior as well.While Thor was ostracized to earth in the first movie, the roles are now reversed and Jane Foster, played by Natalie Portman, is taken to Asgard. Portman is afforded a more substantial role and is pivotal to proceedings. All in all, she does well as Thor's star struck love interest.Doctor Who alum Christopher Eccleston portrays the implacable Malekith, a dark elf hell bent on seeking retaliation. While he delivers a menacing threat, assuring higher stakes for Thor, ultimately Malekith is tantamount to a generic and one-dimensional antagonist.The highlight of The Dark World is undoubtedly its humor. The blue print is akin to Iron Man 3 and the director is able to balance the comic relief with dramatic sequences. Secondly, the Thor and Loki dynamic is a thrill for viewers. Their collective charisma ensures some of the movie's better sequences.Moreover, the action and visual effects, in keeping with other Marvel movies, are exquisite. Battles are well executed and expansive, particularly the swashbuckling finale. Last but not least, the story arcs for both Thor and Loki culminate in an emotionally satisfying manner.The film is not without its loopholes though. At a running time of only 112 minutes, events unfold at breakneck speed, which may feel like several scenes have been edited. Ultimately, the sequel is bigger than its precursor in terms of scale and provides an engaging movie going experience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>oh my god! this was just! no words!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK so i do have some words and they go a little something like this.... this movie was Bad with a capital B, Now i am an avid action film lover and mainly of marvel films and i went in with high hopes because i liked the first one but ill say again so disappointed.Allow me to list what was missing/wrong from this film,1) The plot! well i had trouble finding it or maybe i did find it but didn't believe that was it so i kept looking, it just did not suck me in at all and it didn't leave me wanting more.2) Visual effects! they were OK i guess seemed kind of dated in some places not the best iv seen but hey not the worst, Still for a movie of this caliber and expectations it was very much lacking.3) The Characters! (aka the soul of a movie) well this movie had no soul in fact when i left i felt mine died a little, this made me kinda sad but i got a frozen coke on the way out so that made me feel better for a little while i guess. Anyway i thought we were going to see the characters develop more but i was wrong again and man i hate it when i'm wrong 16 times in one day, I felt nothing for them i didn't even care for any of them and that bothers me a lot when you go to see a movie like this and you don't care? something is wrong and or missing.4) The Humor! A lot of people are talking about this both bad and good but i can't comment cause i didn't see nor hear any humor.5) Reaction from the Audience! Like watching a movie with friends when you reacted together in the same way for example laugh at something amusing it makes the movie more enjoyable, non existent in my theater of about 12 or so but still you would expect something like a laugh, a giggle or gasping but well you already know what i'm going to say.In conclusion this is my first time submitting a review for a movie and to be bothered so much by a movie to then write one has to mean something, It just seems like movies these days are lacking in heart they just want to pump these out without putting heart in them and that makes me sad... sad enough that now i have to go watch friends to cheer me up.Thank you for reading and remember these are just my thoughts and opinions by all means if you want to see it please do and form your own thoughts on the experience and i hope you enjoyed reading.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Speaking as one to whom Thor represents the current nadir of the ambitious but increasingly Sammy Marvel Cinematic Universe, I am pleased to think that Thor: The Dark World represents a distinct step in the right direction. Though not, perhaps, a terribly large one. It fixes one gaping problem I had with the first movie, though: Alan Taylor's muted directing, while not anything terribly special or bold or distinctive in any meaningful way, is vastly more appealing than the kitschy huckster ism that Kenneth Branagh brought bear back in 2011. Though I gather this will not be the opinion of those who maintain that Branagh was an inspired choice to direct that film, an opinion I recognize as existing even if I am totally unclear as to why someone would harbor it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Loki Rules</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Greetings again from the darkness. While this is the second Thor movie, we feel a bit more familiar with the Norse God thanks to The Avengers. It's not surprising that Chris Hemsworth can hold his own with the character given his looks and physicality, but this time he gets a run for his money thanks to Tom Hiddleston as Loki.The film's real villain is Malekith (Christopher Eccleston) who rules the Dark Elves and is trying to re-capture the all-powerful Aether, a substance of infinite energy. But the whole battle for the 9 realms is really just a sideline to Thor vs Loki, and Thor's touch of humanity and eye for Jane Foster (Natalie Portman). Most of the key characters are back: Anthony Hopkins as Odin (even more over the top this time), Rene Russo (Thor's mom), Ray Stevenson as Volstagg, Jaimie Alexander (Sif), Idris Elba (Heimdall), Kat Dennings (Darcy), and Stellan Skarsgard (Erik Selvig).This sequel is kind of interesting to analyze. It's certainly bigger than the original ... the special effects are huge and much improved. Light comic moments abound, but luckily the snark from Kat Dennings is minimal. Chris O'Dowd shows up for a couple of pretty funny, but slightly out of place scenes. There are a couple of cameos including an off-beat appearance by one of the The Avengers. Rene Russo even gets her own sword fight! Though it matters not to me, I assume there are many who would choose a Skarsgard other than Stellan to run around Stonehenge sans clothes. So while it has all of that going for it, the story is certainly fails at engaging the audience.This one is directed by Alan Taylor, who is quite a successful TV director, and there was clearly some upfront concern over the script as Joss Whedon was brought in for scene doctoring. I believe what we learn is that the fish out of water story works when Thor is on Earth, but it loses impact when Jane Foster visits Asgard. Still, Tom Hiddleston is such fun to watch as Loki, that none of that really matters.It's a superhero movie that will entertain the fans and provide plenty of ammunition for the critics looking to bash. If you see it in the theatre, you should know to stay for BOTH post-movie scenes. A rare Benecio Del Toro sighting makes it worthwhile.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very comic-book like, but with little emotional impact</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is more fun than the first Thor, but also a bit more unfocused, not really knowing what it's aiming for. It feels way more comic-y, a good thing in a comic book movie I think - very colourful, strong images, and so on - though it goes a bit high on silliness during the endfight when the earth-worms jizz them POWERS all across the nine worlds and back again.One thing I didn't understand - why did the screenwriters raise the stakes like they did? Obviously they wanted a funnier adventure this time, and there's some really nice laughs and even slapstick - so why not a "smaller" plot? I never had the impression that the future of the universe was at stake, but if we have to believe Odin and the scientists - it was. Never felt that way. There's a point where it's a matter of seconds if the universe will cease to exist, and Thor coyly travels by Subway to the epicenter of events (after politely asking for directions, of course) - that's very funny and silly but completely stops the action and takes away much impact.And, come on - where was the romance? There was more emotion between Thor and Loki than between Thor and Jane. It worked in Thor1 (kind of) so why not here? Where were the sparks flying between Sif and Jane?What I really did like was Loki, it was always one of the strengths of the Marvel comics that their villains could (and sometimes would) be heroes in a different situation. Hiddleston really steals the show. Other highlights: The spaceship designs and most costumes.Overall: An entertaining and fun movie that takes itself less serious than necessary and suffers from an uneven tone in the way "The Fifth Element" did - if you liked that one, you'll be OK with Thor2, too!</fullReview>

It's all fun an game, but when the serious moment arrived the seriousness didn't get to peak ... because the joke lighted the mood over all of the movie. All characters got a moment which is great for the actors, maybe not as much for the movie it self... the time get chopped up bait too much. Some of the lines are bait too cheesy.I felt like they promoted the fun too much and not enough sadness or heaviness as it should have been but that could also been the preview's faults since it looks so sad, dark and dramatic in the trailer... but that being said it's a bast seeing the movie. The landscape of the worlds is much much better we see more and it feels more real.... there is a physical location being shown geographically which is great. Love the ending... altho i totally saw it coming... The best serious moment for me was maybe when we see Logi all broken before he got out...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Thor was one of my favorite of the Marvel Phase 1 movies. I loved it's fun mix of fantasy and real world adventure and thought Hemsworth made a noble and very likable hero. And now the Norse God turned superhero is back in his second solo adventure and a welcome return it is. Thor: The Dark World opens 5000 years earlier with an alignment of the planets being taken advantage of by the Dark Elves and their leader Malekith (Christopher Eccleston) to unleash a weapon called The Aether which will convert all the worlds into dark matter where only the Dark Elves may exist. Thor's grandfather Bor (Tony Curran) defeats the invaders and they are assumed destroyed and The Aether is hidden away never to be found... or so Bor hoped. But, in the present, the worlds are aligning again and the long dormant Malekith and the remaining Dark Elves seek to destroy all once more and, as fate would have it, Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) stumbles upon the hidden weapon and it is absorbed within her. Now hunted by Malekith, Thor (Chris Hemsworth) brings Jane to Asgard against Odin's (Anthony Hopkins) wishes and must somehow find a way to stop Malekith, banish The Aether and save the woman he loves and all the known worlds... and the only one who can help him is his devious step brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston) imprisoned in Asgard's dungeons by Thor's own hand. This second solo adventure is this time directed by Game Of Thrones and Deadwood director Alan Taylor who creates a much grittier and down to Earth version of Asgard then the bright and magic kingdom-ish version we saw in the delightful first feature directed by Kenneth Branagh. It's still recognizable as Asgard and it blends perfectly with the first Thor but, we get to see far deeper into the city and into it's halls and pubs and get a more lived in and functional look at Thor's homeland. The tone of the film is also darker at times and that was a nice change from the upbeat first film and Avengers but, so not to get too dark or grim, the film is punctuated with a lot of fun and humorous sequences especially those involving Darcy (Kat Dennings) and Eric Selvig (Stellan Skarsgard), the latter's trip to Stonehenge being especially hilarious. I thought the humor and the darker story elements were blended just fine and there was plenty of action and strong drama throughout till the big free-for-all ending set in London where Thor and Malekith finally get to throw down. And the action and special effects do not disappoint, they are top notch as all the previous Marvel films. The budget is on screen in all aspects from sets to costumes to FX. Taylor gets good work from all the cast. There are some nice character moments in between the drama and destruction and all the actors are now very comfortable in their roles and work very well together. Hemsworth is once again a noble hero who has grow since his first visit and the battle in New York. He and Portman still have a nice chemistry together and I liked their scenes especially when Thor has to explain where he's been for two years. Dennings gets a bit more screen time and handles it well getting some of the bigger laughs and Hiddleston is once again scene stealing as Loki. It was also nice to see Rene Russo get a big scene and have a bit bigger part this time and Hopkins is still endearing as the weary but, majestic Odin. We also get some nice scenes with supporting characters Heimdall (Idris Elba), Sith (Jaimie Alexander), Volstagg (Ray Stevenson), Fandral (now Zachary Levi) and Hogun (Tadanobu Asano) but, those expecting expanded roles from this bunch will be disappointed. Newcomer to Thor's world Christopher Ecceleston, is OK as villain Malekith but, he really doesn't make a strong impression or stay with you after the film is over. To me his somewhat tepid villain is the film's only real stand out weak point. Taylor's interpretation of Don Payne and Robert Rodat's script is highlighted by a moody score by Brian May and some nice cinematography by Kramer Morgenthau. Overall, Thor: The Dark World is a very entertaining follow-up that gives us enough of the action, drama and suspense we are looking for and takes it in enough of a different direction to keep it fresh but, not straying too far to alienate us. It's not perfect, as stated the villain could have been stronger, there are a few slows spots here and there especially in the first half and earlier on we can tell there was a bit of editing to manage the running time but, for all the entertainment we get, those minor flaws can be overlooked. A fun and worthy sequel to both Thor and The Avengers and certainly less schizophrenic then the mixed bag that was Iron Man 3. As with all Marvel films stay through the entire credits for not one but, two additional sequences and keep an eye out for a couple of really fun cameos. Another solid bit of entertainment from Marvel and Disney.</fullReview>

Loved the action and amazing effects .Loki's repetitive role, the way it was shown predictably that he would be alive was poor, it should have been a lot better and would have earned a more remarkable "wow" factor which was missed and looked ordinary that yes Thor 3 is coming or Loki is going to continue as enemy in Marvel's one of next .Thor 1 is still a lot better than this . Anthony Hopkins's role as king looked short in command , with less army shown and premature weapons with them and in Asgard like just laser guns . When enemies breached for Odin's wife, no guards were there. Years passed by in the movie and in real for making Thor 2 obvious, so should have been better with small things too . Will be very disappointing if we see that Loki has actually killed Odin and has taken over in the next . Over all Great, but the story and scripts of all good &amp; bad guys wanted a lot more!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Thor 2" Will Floor You!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Chris Hemsworth wields his mighty hammer Mjölnir for the third time as the brawny Norse deity in "Game of Thrones" director Alan Taylor's "Thor: The Dark World." Happily, virtually everybody from director Kenneth Branagh's immaculate but lackluster predecessor reprises their respective roles. "Thor: The Dark World" boasts a sufficiently complex plot with more than enough grandiose escapades intermingled with amusing antics to keep you distracted throughout its swiftly-paced 112 minutes. The first "Thor" came up short on spectacle and surprises, but the sequel delivers several bolts from the blue that keep its outlandish but formulaic shenanigans invigorating. Charismatic performances from the buffed-up, blond Hemsworth; the brainy, brunette Natalie Portman; the maniacal Christopher Eccleston; and the treacherous Tom Hiddleston enliven this imaginative Marvel Comics entry. Not only does "Thor: The Dark World" surpass its humdrum 'origins' predecessor, but it also picks up the saga where the superlative"Avengers" left off. Indeed, some things haven't changed. Odin isn't entirely pleased with his son's rebellious behavior, and their troubled relationship puts our hero at odds with his one-eyed father. Despite Odin's stern objections, Thor rekindles his romance with astrophysicist Jane Foster after a two year absence. Eventually, Thor tangles with a sinister army of Dark Elves and their ultimate doomsday weapon that threatens to obliterate not only Earth but also the Nine Realms of the Universe. No, "Thor: The Dark World" isn't quite as entertaining overall as either "The Avengers" or "Iron Man 3." Nevertheless, Taylor and scenarists Christopher Yost, Christopher Markus, and Stephen McFeely, working from a story by Don Payne and Robert Rodat, manage to mobilize enough machismo, mayhem, and self-mockery to make it worth watching more than once. "Thor: The Dark World" unfolds centuries before Odin (Anthony Hopkins of "Hannibal") entrusted the legendary hammer to his impetuous son Thor. According to Odin, Thor's grandfather Bor invaded Alfheim with an army Asgard warriors and routed the rodent-faced legion of Dark Elves in a pitched battle. The leader of the Elves, Malekith (Christopher Eccleston of the BBC's "Dr. Who" television series), had sought to use a doomsday weapon called the Aether. This Aether resembles a red and black confetti-like substance that swirls ominously in the air. Bor trapped the Aether and buried it in the ground. Several millenniums later, Thor's old flame Jane Foster (Natalie Portman of "Black Swam") discovers a portal between London, England and the Dark World. Unfortunately, the Aether infects Jane. Thor comes to Jane's rescue and ushers her to Asgard for treatment. Initially, Odin is far from ecstatic about this turn of events. Actually, Thor's father believes his son should stick to his own kind. He urges Thor to take Sif (Jaimie Alexander of "The Last Stand") as his bride. The Dark Elves launch their own invasion of Asgard, and one of its most prominent residents dies during the onslaught. Reluctantly, Thor recruits his two-timing, half-brother, Loki (Tom Hiddleston of "War Horse") to help him. Meantime, Malekith unleashes mass destruction on London as our heroes scramble to save the day.You really cannot fault the writing in "Thor: The Dark World." The capable scenarists know their subject matter. Christopher Yost has penned several episodes of various Marvel television series, including "Wolverine and the X-Men," "Fantastic Four: World's Greatest Heroes," and "Iron Man: Armored Adventures." Similarly, Markus and Stephen McFeely collaborated on both "Captain America: The First Avenger" and its sequel "Captain America: Winter Soldier." Taylor and his writers take Thor and company on some adrenalin, roller-coaster rides that include jaunts through wormholes in time as well as one adrenaline-laced aerial pursuit in a huge, T-shaped, flying aircraft and later in a boat that cruises on the wind. Taylor choreographs several epic combat sequences that shun blood, sweat and tears, but keep you shadow boxing with our heroes. Naturally, our heroes survive by the skin of their teeth. The malevolent Dark Elves appear quite sinister with their pale, cadaverous masks and their minions look equally intimidating in appearance and number. They possess a Darth Vader quality and are determined to triumph over Thor and company. Twice as visually stunning as the resplendent original was, "Thor: The Dark World" pits our protagonists against some supernatural opponents, such as a gargantuan creature made up of stones and a gigantic beast that resembles a hybrid of a bull and a hippopotamus. Taylor and company lighten up the slam-bang action heroics with clever humor that enables you to laugh when you aren't flinching at all the acrobatic fisticuffs. Hemsworth uses Mjölnir with the ease of and hurls it like a boomerang during some scenes. Thor's quartet of faithful brethen, Sif (Jaimie Alexander), Fandral (Zachary Levi), Volstagg (Ray Stevenson), and Hugan (Tadanobu Asano), have developed a camaraderie that is displayed in the way that Taylor stages their action scenes. They keep tabs on each other in the midst of all the chaos and often save each other from certain death.Performances all around are robust with each character getting a moment or two to radiate personality, particularly Anthony Hopkins, Stellan Skarsg?rd, Kat Dennings, and Natalie Portman. Audiences should know that the film doesn't grind to a complete halt when the end-credits roll. Two scenes ensue at different intervals and furnish foreshadowing as well as closure and comedy. One prominent S.H.I.E.L.D. agent whose own sequel is scheduled for a Spring 2014 release appears briefly in a side-splitting cameo. Naturally, Marvel Comics co-creator Stan Lee shows up in one scene and blurts an uproarious line. This "Thor" will floor you!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was very interested in seeing how they would up the Thor sequel and I have to say it was a great movie on the whole. Asgard was amazing and had a great feel about it, you felt you were there yourself. But I felt although humour in the marvel movies is great and they hit it just right in the first movie, it was to forced in this one. It almost felt like they should have run a canned laughter track and had some of the awful jokes written by the people who made 2 and a half men (the world most over rated crock comedy). Thor's use of flight was really great and had some great shots of him flying about. But like in the previous movie Loki stole the show! Christopher Eccleston did a great job playing the Dark Elf king. If you love Marvel you have to see it just to complete the set.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The thing that pleased me most is that this movie is so much fun to watch, which is in fact an irony given its name. The first Thor (2011) contained darker and serious themes concerning father son relationship, betrayal and in some places was painfully slow to watch. But this time, its gun blazing from the first scene and the pace remained consistent till the end credits !The best part of the film is that the writers/directors avoided the mistakes which they usually do while making a sequel to a hit movie.They tend to make story lines nostalgic and repeated, put in huge amounts of cash (which is not bad though :P) and try so hard in making the sequel perfect that the movie becomes bland and losses all its sheen in the process. One classic example is Speed -2. But thats not the case in Thor 2013. Storyline is kept basic but still entertaining, dialogs bit clichéd but not cheesy and action scenes were better and bigger but not confusing and complex (a la Transformers where you can't even track who is getting thrashed by whom!).All the major characters returned from the first film and each one performed up to expectations, Thor is more sleek, Jane is more charming, Erik more mad... but to me, the real star of the movie is Loki ! he somehow makes a scene more fun and engaging. Loki has risen in stature this time, especially after the events in New York. Everybody knows that he is shrewd and opportunistic but now he somehow gains a mystical respect which nobody shows but everybody feels for him, even the audience !This time, Thor has to not only save Asgard or Earth but the whole universe and the only person who can help him in his fight against the dark forces is Loki himself. The dynamics of brotherly love are evident between them but they still are enemies and this weird equation creates an exciting chemistry between the two.Watch this movie to see why sometimes saving universe can be fun !</fullReview>

		<fullReview>i don't generally mind silly clichéd stories and try to ignore them, but gave up and went to the cinema mostly to see some fancy FX. there were some, and some more and then even more - pretty much apart from the shallow story, it is no wonder that the visual effects make this movie, but then there was the astonishing surprisingly good humor! i guess it's the weather in London that helped inspire some crazy little jokes that simply saved the movie.you wouldn't expect that a heroic fantasy movie would be saved by jokes, but here it is, so many little moments that were delightful and helped forget the rest of the nonsense.this and Tom Hiddleston who is the superstar in this episode of Thor, he is incredible and hopefully will be given even more space in another followup. it was he who helped sustain some kind of a story throughout the hollow graphic scenes - what an excellent actor! apparently marvel have realized that the universe of the avengers is what keeps people going to the theaters, so it was really nice to have scenes with ties with the other superheroes, and even continuity with the Avengers movie. i wonder what Disney will do with the star wars franchise, kinda scary that the cashflow is guaranteed with only a mention of some of the iconic characters there...anyway...Thor...quite fun(ny). i wonder how the first episode actually did in box office, but might be there will be need for a new superhero movie soon. because a super hero movie cannot be sustained by jokes only... the original batman somewhat proved it - it was the Dark Knight that made me really consider this a great story.so...Thor...well... :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thor 2 &gt; Thor 1 - But is it still a good film, worth to watch?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm a really big fan of superheroes, I've read many comics and I've watched nearly every film, which is based on a superheroe comic. Thor - The Dark World is far better than the previous Thor but I have to admit that the sequel wasn't worth to watch in the cinema, on the release date. Even though we can see a film, which offers you far more action than the forerunner, you can't overlook the fact that Marvel-Studios has created this film. During the first 40 minutes I've experienced an immense entertainment because the director Alan Taylor was really successful at creating a great atmosphere, the plot was taken really seriously, because it didn't contain any of these typical small jokes which normally appear during a Marvel-film. In addition there were a lot of mistakes considering the logic of the plot. After the first part the film became more and more atrocious, especially in the end. I will give "Thor-The Dark World" 6 out of 10 points because the film offered me more entertainment than the forerunner but if it was only for the first part, I would give 9 out of 10 points.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's a decent Marvel movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's a typical Marvel movies. Like most of Marvel movies in recent years, Thor: The Dark World is presented in a light and humorous tone(in contrast to DC Comics movies that are darker and more serious). It's a straightforward fantasy/sci-fi/action movie. Some attempts on humor would seemed a bit desperate and unnecessary, especially when they are doing some serious sequence. The storyline is pretty standard, but it's pretty much what is expected. The visual FX is good, but the 3D version is still the Hollywood version of "Show me the money". All in all, I am not overly impressed, but it is a decent Marvel Superheroes movie, and it will continue to entertain a lot of fans. My ratings: 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Okay! Phew! Seriously??</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am not going to blame this on Marvel as some people I speak to seem to want to say DC is better simply because directing talent has managed to bring Batman, Watchmen and the latest Man of Steel to the screen with an authentic feel while Marvel is still keen on getting that young audience. ;/ I enjoyed the first Thor immensely and I took my daughter and we both loved it. So what's wrong with number two? First off, I found the movie was a continuation from Avengers Assemble, so it felt rushed I for one would have wanted to know how the bridge was rebuilt that Thor destroyed and cut him off from Jane, that still remains a mystery. Secondly the action felt rushed and there were no real WOW! moments just the occasional "that was good". To bring it to perspective the best fight scene was Frigga vs Dark Elf Lord, precisely it was a shock that Frigga could wield a sword with such elegance seeing she was so easily dispatched by the Ice Giant in part 1. Thirdly, I know this was a 12A but I would have liked to see more of a romantic development between Jane and Thor, she was rather eager to snatch her hand from the big fella when ever intimacy was evident. An opportunity missed to redeem the weak action. The cliff hanger at the end was rather confusing. What happened to Odin? It wasn't all bad, the film managed to strike up some real emotion around loss, this for me was the only positive. On the flip side, my daughter loved it and I think this film will sit well with the under 12's but if you are a grown up I say wait for Hunger Games instead. 5 out of 10 for me. Not great but not seriously bad either, just poor from an already flourishing franchise.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Marvels first let down Spoilers MIT be in this</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Thor 2 first off wasn't a bad movie first of all. The Main reason i was let down was because there was too much Humber it was like they where forced to shove Humber down are troths but Besides that Tom Hiddleston hes scenes where so Funny The Other reason was that the villain Malekith played by Christopher Eccleston i felt that he was week and kinda plain it wasn't Christopher Eccleston fault he just didn't suit the role he just didn't hold up and an other reason there was a fight between Thor and Malekitch and he was so bad it was like it lasted for 2mins maybe less then Thor won it was a joke and there was parts of of the second half where Loki dies and after that scene they went back the jokes like from there really id think thats where the movie wood pick up and start to be come more serious but no they keep on with the humber i really think this was the most disappointing movies this year One of marvels most disappointing movies ever i wanted to go in turning my brain off but i just couldn't</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>HK Auteur Review - Thor: The Dark World</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Thor: The Dark World properly continues the story after The Avengers (sorry, Iron Man 3) and Thor. It retains the things that I liked about the first installment without repeating them. The plot moves fast and it's intense. Things never gets too grim and has a genuine sense of adventure and awe. Dry witty humor is used again effectively to balance out the ridiculousness of Norse gods walking amongst humans. The fights look tough and grueling, more so than in The Avengers. Partly because everybody's physically melee fighting and the Dark Elves are actually physically challenging to Thor and the Asgardians.The Nine Realms are explored more thoroughly and the audience gets to spend more time on Asgard, which is a much more interesting place to be than Earth. The designs and world creation are impressive, particularly in the disaster sequences. It shows how brilliant an idea it was in the first film to imply that magic is unexplainable science, thereby combining and justifying both.Chris Hemsworth owns the role of Thor with his presence. Thor is a character whose depths are only shown when interacting with other characters, which is that served as a disadvantage in The Avengers. In his own movie, there's an immense cast to give him that depth. I liked his arc in this story. Natalie Portman gets to be the fish out of water this time around and it's an entertaining reversal.Tom Hiddleston again oozes charm as Loki. It's a great actor relishing a great part. He plays the audience like an instrument as we intermittently love and hate him. The writers put a lot of work in designing the twists and turns in Loki's infinite mind games, truly earning the character the title of "God of Mischief". Loki fooled me again and again throughout and I kept wanting to trust him.The Warriors Three gets wrecked a bit. It seemed like there was some scheduling problem in which Tabanobu Asano's Hogun had to be reduced. Also, I prefer the Joshua Dallas as Fandral, who had to be replaced by Zachary Levi from Chuck. Levi by comparison seems to struggle channeling Errol Flynn. Both cases are unfortunate.The new villain Malekith played by Christopher Eccleston is buried under a lot of Dark Elf make-up and speaking an alien language in his own scenes, which removes any chance of proper scenery chewing. His presence as a villain is ultimately functional on par with Hugo Weaving's Red Skull. Malekith exists for the main characters to grow and there's nothing wrong with that. In fact, it is noteworthy. Marvel seems to be ensuring that their villains never are more interesting than their heroes. The heart of the story is still the central relationship between Thor and Loki. In fact, it's probably the most interesting relationship in the current Marvel cinematic universe. Director Alan Taylor knows this and competently moves their story forward.The numerous Stan Lee cameos is starting to get creepy because it means there are a growing amount of Stan Lee lookalike clones in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. And is it me or has Anthony Hopkins been playing the majority of his roles like a Norse god all this time? I am just kidding.Depending where Captain America: Winter Soldier goes with Captain America's story, I wonder how many more solo movies Marvel actually needs to plan out. It doesn't look like they're planning any solo Hulk films and Iron Man seems to be up in the air right now. Who knows how Guardians of the Galaxy is going to turn out. But they can really just start doing more Avengers movies at this point. That said, I do want to see what happens with Thor and Loki in a third installment. Actually, a third Thor is very necessary.For more reviews, please visit my film blog @ http://hkauteur.wordpress.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ridiculously bad......and stupid</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A movie for young adults....between the ages of 14 and 23. Lots of un-coordinated action and a script that is worse than I can possibly describe. The acting is abysmal (and what was Anthony Hopkins doing in this terrible film?) I suppose its an easy pay check for him. Still, he must be a little embarrassed. Super Hero trash , like this is strictly for air-heads. Watching things burst into flames and dumb "heroes" pretending to be heroic is idiotic. These awful movies are for the brain dead. Or should I say the living dead. If you are above 25 years old, and you go to see flicks like this---you need treatment....of a psychiatric nature. (3 points)</fullReview>
