		<shortDescription>This movie might single handedly destroy Megan Fox career</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Oh my god, what was I thinking to watch this film with my brother. I cannot believe I paid any money at all to watch this rubbish film. THE BAD:Megan Fox's acting A script so bad that the writers should go back to 3rd grade. The movie is a mess. Very Noisy. Lacks imagination. Completely forgettable. I mean I could go on all day.The only thing good about this movie is Josh Brolin, he gives a good performance as Jonah Hex, he tries to save this complete mess of a film. But sadly its too much of a bloated mess to save. I truly feel bad for him. As for Megan Fox, she better start having some acting lessons, cause this movie has the potential to absolutely sent her career to the grave. After loosing her role in Transformers 3, she desperately needs to do something.I can only give this movie 3 stars because Brolin, who you can see tried really hard and was successful portraying Jonah Hex. Its just sad that Jonah Hex was there, but the movie itself wasn't.3/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A plethora of under-ratings and over expectations!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Analysis Paralysis!It was fun. Everyone did a competent job. It's not a movie for intellectuals, just for people who enjoy flicks. As more people see it, its rating will go up. It's now 4.3/10 with 1,266 votes. Watch.I really enjoyed that the special F/X were not overdone.It's a comic book fer cryin' out loud!, it's not supposed to be No Country for Old Men!I was never bored, it was well paced. That whole business with the dead people was fun and nice plot enhancer.I really don't know what all the negative fuss it about.It's not a summer blockbuster, it's a summer popcorn and soda, better-than-T.V. techno western flick.Actually, my expectations were so diminished by all the bad press that I enjoyed it More that I expected I would.As I read all the detailed bad press and saw what over analysis was in the comments, and discounted all that, that's what put me over the edge to go and see it.And I'm glad I did.It was fun.No one's careers were ruined. Just briskly moving summer fun.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Complete Guide to a User Ratings Travesty</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sometimes I wonder if people that reviewed this film actually watched it, or if they gave it a chance, not like second glancing at it because they're cooking dinner at the same time.Jonah Hex is an entertaining little movie based upon the DC Comic Book character. To be honest, I've never read the comic, had little expectations coming in, and wouldn't have gone to see this in the theater. This genre is admittedly, 'right up my alley'. Usually I check some ratings on here before renting movies so that I avoid the flops. Thankfully, I didn't look on IMDb until AFTER I had already rented it. So when I looked at IMDb's 4.6 user rating AFTER renting it, but BEFORE watching it; my expectations were lowered even further, and I nearly put off watching it, again. Nevertheless, it was due the next day and I popped it in the DVD player when the other-half went to bed(too bad - she would have liked it). I have a good sound system and a nice TV - both made this action/western/fantasy even better.Let's take a look at some of the films on IMDb with similar user ratings - specifically some of the worst films that I have ever seen/wasted my time and money on.Ready to Wear(Pret-A-Porter)4.8 Actually rated higher than Jonah Hex. This was two hours I will NEVER get back. A terribly boring movie with no redeeming qualities whatsoever.King Solomon's Mines 4.6 Tied with Jonah Hex. This may be the worst movie I have ever seen. A literal walk out of the theater. And I know what you're thinking. I talked about giving movies a chance earlier, but I revisited KSM years later, and it still remains the worst film I've ever seen in my lifetime, 1 and a half times. Toys 4.6 Enough said.Jonah Hex' style is true to the comic book theme. The opening of the film is excellent, and gives us a good foundation for an entertaining storyline. John Malkovich is ALWAYS a good adversary/bad guy, and Josh Brolin IS Jonah Hex. Megan Foxes' role is small, and she serves every purpose, much like a smoking hot Bond girl. Her Body alone makes this film worth 4.6.But, Jonah Hex is much more. It's interesting, it's action packed, and it's well-paced. Now, is it believable? No. What comic book based film is? Is it Oscar worthy? No. Will it appear on any legitimate 2010 Top Ten lists? No. Jonah Hex is the pure definition of a popcorn flick. Not just one that rare movie watchers might over-rate(It's no nine or ten), and one that critics will annihilate, but one that is sure to surprise many who give it a chance. It's worth the rental - especially if you have a TV and sound system that can give you a near theater experience. I like some of the subtle touches to this movie, and Malkovich and Brolin really help the cause.58/100You'll like it if you liked: Fantastic Four Rise of the Silver Surfer, Brotherhood of the Wolf, and Timecop.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty bad, but not as bad as some are saying.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First, I want to mention some of the good stuff. Josh Brolin is excellent as Hex, perfect casting, great job by Brolin, thoroughly enjoyable to watch. John Malkovich was very good in a role that could have easily been too over the top to be taken seriously. Fassbender was genuinely creepy, Jeffrey Dean Morgan was great, and Megan Fox looks gorgeous and her acting is not that bad. Combine that with an amazing soundtrack by Mastodon, (and a surprise cameo by Brent Hinds) I have to say I enjoyed the movie. The negatives: "The Weapon" - a weird, quasi-science, completely unexplained "nation-killer" invented by Eli Whitney... WTF? Stupid. While on the subject, why does the world have to be at stake? A simple revenge tale would have sufficed. Aidan Quinn was awful, but it probably wasn't his fault, unless he wrote his own lines. Why tell Hex's backstory with a couple of minutes of poorly animated crap with a voice-over when they could've filmed Hex's origin sequence and made it a much better movie? No idea, but I can't explain many of the choices that were made on this movie. Why was it only 80 minutes long? Who thought that was a good idea? Who cast Will Arnett in a straight role? I kept waiting for him to do something funny. To sum it up, there was some really good work done on this movie, but there were too many terrible decisions made that left it a disjointed mess in spite of its potential. As a life-long Jonah Hex fan, I was happy to see him captured so perfectly by Brolin, but disappointed as hell that the studio screwed up the movie so badly, and ruined any chance of this becoming a successful franchise.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gets progressively worse as it goes along.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Starts off as an excercise in mediocrity and cliché but manages to sink even lower as the film's (thankfully short) running time comes to a close. What a shame. The original Neveldine and Taylor script (which I only read half of because I didn't want to spoil myself silly) was actually quite good. Episodic in the way that Hex gets himself into bizarre jams (much like the original 70's comic) on the road to the film's Macguffin. One such jam being he runs into a town where the occupants have all been lobotomized. Unfortunately, none of that makes it to the final film and although a lot of the film was cut down I don't believe they filmed even 90% of what was in that script. What remains of the N &amp; T script is the Gatling gun sequence (albeit without the gore) and the arena sequence (heavily reworked and, ultimately, uninteresting). There are one or two shots where Hex is riding through the countryside at night. I'd like to know if any other IMDBers were having trouble making out what was going on in those shots. Poorly lit. Have cinematographers forgotten to lens a night scene in westerns? All "day for night" jokes aside, this is terrible. I never thought I would see such an eye strainingly dim scene in a big budgeted Hollywood picture. Shameful. As for the charisma vacuum that is Megan Fox, she's surprisingly substantial in her introductory scene but falls into familiar territory, for her (empty expression/lifeless), shortly after.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>hmmmm....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm hesitant to call this an out and out terrible movie as some have labelled it simply because it was mildly entertaining. There's a lot of action, some cool ideas, a great performance by Josh Brolin and the short 80 minute running time doesn't hurt it either.The sad truth of the whole thing is that it just didn't come close to its potential. For starters, Jonah Hex didn't have to be macabre and supernatural...to my knowledge this wasn't even part of the original comic books that the movie is based on. The original story is simple, Jonah Hex's family is murdered, he's horribly scarred and left for dead. He gets better and sets out for revenge. It's a pretty classic western tale...one that we've seen before but given the general lack of western movies these days, that doesn't matter...there's plenty of room in theatres for a fun out for revenge Western. Having said all that, the supernatural ideas that they came up with are actually kinda cool, and I would've been happy to see them mixed in, if only they'd been handled better. Instead these elements seem tossed in as an excuse to include CG effects that the box office loves oh so much.The end result is an unfortunate mash up of a good ideas...that maybe could've worked if more time had been put into development, it feels like it was either slapped together too hastily or suffered from a massive reedit...during most of the film I couldn't shake the feeling that there was maybe a 2 hour+ director's cut lying on the floor somewhere which may or may not be a superior and more coherent film. I was looking forward Jonah Hex based on a short appearance he had in a Batman cartoon years ago...from that alone I thought the character had a lot of movie potential but I was let down. Brolin's performance is the best part of the movie. Malkovich is good but nothing too spectacular considering his track record, and even Megan Fox is half decent but she doesn't have a lot to do with her pretty much useless character.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Short and not bad enough to offend at least</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm a fan of comics and westerns so even though I knew of Jonah Hex in name only this was something I knew I could probably at least sit through. I've seen some reviews and they seem a little harsh. It wasn't anything special but it moved a long fairly quickly and I wasn't bored for what that's worth.I agree with others that Brolin was a good choice for Hex. I was glad to see Malkovich there but he seemed a tad underwhelming. I think he's a great actor so I trust he nailed the character though. Will Arnett stuck out like a sore thumb in the small number of scenes he was in. He's a goofy, funny guy I just don't really want to see him in a serious role. You almost can't tell if he's for real or being sarcastically serious. Megan Fox is Megan Fox. Why people are complaining so much about her acting I have no idea. She's there for sex appeal. No one thinks she's the next coming of Meryl Streep or something.The movie looked a little too synthetic for me especially some of the "ultimate weapon" stuff. It looked a little too clean for a western too. I don't know why some movies like There Will Be Blood can look so authentic and suck you in to the setting but others like this just look too fake.I figured there would be some fantastic elements involved even though it was grounded in real life, just because of the comic influence. That might have prepared me a little more for the stuff others might have found to be out of place. In fairness movies are a little bit like watching a sporting event for the first time. If you don't know the rules or know what to expect you're likely to not enjoy it much. After the first 5 minutes or so I figured as much to not be jarred by some of the more out of place plot elements, so all in all I thought it was a short, somewhat entertaining movie. Glad it wasn't much longer though.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Potential for great summer popcorn flick wasted</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wasn't really expecting much out of this film. And I thought that it coming out the same weekend as Toy Story 3 was pretty laughable. But it seemed like fun, so I thought I'd give it a try. Sadly, it turned out pretty much how I expected, and it's no wonder there was such little advertisement paid to this film. Jonah Hex is pretty straightforward in it's story. Jonah Hex witnessed his family die at the hands of John Turnbull. Unfortunately, for Hex, Turnbull died mysteriously in a hotel fire...or did he. Turns out Tunrbull is still alive and a danger to the US. Now, Jonah must get his revenge and save the US.A lot of people have compared this film to The Wild Wild West. Thankfully, this is not that film. Granted, it's not all that grounded in reality (actually, it's not grounded in reality much at all), but there's no giant walking spiders or head slicing, flying discs. The action here is pretty ridiculous and outrageous, but at the same is fun. It helps that Josh Brolin, as the titular Jonah Hex, is pretty damn cool. He plays off Dirty Harry pretty well, with only a few one liners and a pretty well drawn out character. In fact, I would say that if they ever do a remake of Dirty Harry, I would vote for Brolin to take up the reins. Unfortunately, most of the rest of the cast is not as good. John Malkovich plays Turnbull lazily. Sure, he's not as hammy as he could have been, which I am grateful for, but I can't help but feel that he isn't the least bit interested in what he is doing. And with the kind of character he's supposed to be, there should be more passion, but it's sadly missing. As for the third big name, Megan Fox does what she does best and looks hot in some slutty western dresses. For a film like this, I guess you can't ask much more from her.The action is obviously where this film is at, and it mostly delivers. It's far from the biggest action film this summer, but there are some pretty outrageous and entertaining pieces, like the Gatling gun-mounted horse and the dynamite gun scenes known from the trailer. And when there isn't action going on, Brolin saves the film. Besides the action, he is the best thing here. I would also even argue that the film does a good job translating the comic book style. While it could have been much better, it could also have been a lot worse. I guess I can at least be thankful for that.Suffice to say, I pretty much got what I thought I would get out of the film: a cool Josh Brolin, a hot Megan Fox, a wooden John Malkovich, and a lot of crazy action. Was I satisfied? I suppose. It was a decent way to kill about an hour and a half. Would I run out to the theater for this? Nah. If you really care about the ticket price and your time, I would just wait to rent it on DVD.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Explosive action with a short fuse</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Remember how people always seem to make jokes that they lose interest in a movie if something isn't blown up in the first five minutes of whatever they're watching? Well, if that's true, those people won't have any problems with the opening of Jonah Hex. There are two huge explosions, a shootout, and a robbery in the first fifteen minutes of the film. Not to mention the fact that the film is beyond loud. With all of the explosions, fires, shootouts, fistfights, and yelling going on in the film, there isn't really a single moment in the film's entire duration where the floor isn't rumbling or your chair isn't shaking from the intense action taking place on screen. While Josh Brolin does a decent job of bringing the Jonah Hex character to life, he seems a bit flat at times. Before I go any further, let me be the first to point out that I didn't read the Jonah Hex comics. So this is purely from a moviegoer's standpoint. Jonah Hex is so focused on getting revenge for his family that he's really kind of boring other than the occasional wise remark every so often. He can apparently talk to dead people, which is kind of interesting. But animals tend to have a thing for him, too; horses, dogs, a huge murder of crows. Did anyone else find it humorous that every time Hex left a location, it was either burning, exploding, or a combination of both? Megan Fox brings mostly eye candy to her role as a promiscuous woman who has a soft spot for Jonah Hex and has a decent action scene towards the end of the film, but adds little to her repertoire as far as acting goes. The supporting cast of actors alone should have sold this movie. John Malkovich as the main villain supports that theory, but his character is also pretty dull. He lost the thing he loved most in this world thanks to Jonah Hex and the military, so he's decided to kill innocent bystanders and destroy the United States. That's about as deep as his character gets. Small parts were given to actors that probably should have been around longer than they were. Will Arnett ("Arrested Development") is around long enough for you to notice he's in a serious role, Wes Bentley (American Beauty) has a similar role that buckles under the intimidation of Malkovich's Quentin Turnbull, and Jeffrey Dean Morgan (Watchmen) has a five minute scene that kind of makes you wonder why he took the part to begin with. Michael Fassbender (Inglourious Basterds) was pretty enjoyable as Burke though. He seems to make the most out of his short time on screen.The film has quite a few drawbacks. The main one being that it's incredibly short. It isn't even an hour and a half long. So everything moves along at a rushed pace. The animated opening felt out of place, as well. A live-action adaptation shouldn't really try to make a point to rub the audience's nose in the fact that it's based on a comic book. Be an all around good film first and a homage to your source material second. The animation seemed kind of sloppy, as well. In a time where 3D technology is at its peak and Studio Ghibli and Disney are still producing top of the line hand drawn animated films, it's difficult not to notice when something like that isn't up to par. Maybe it's just the anime fan in me, but did the orange detonation balls in the film remind anyone else of the dragonballs from Dragonball Z? Jonah Hex is incredibly flawed and the film seems to try and make a point to showoff its weak points more than anything, but it's short enough that it doesn't seem like torture and tries to be as explosively entertaining as it can during that runtime. If Desperado and Van Helsing could somehow meet, spend a romantic evening together, and mate that resulted in offspring in the form of film, Jonah Hex would be their love child.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This paint by numbers western revenge comic flick is certainly not offensive or ineffective to deserve such a negative buzz.&nbsp;Jonah Hex's family is killed. Scarred and back from the dead, he finds his families killer is dead. Feeling robbed of his revenge he becomes a bounty hunter but when America is put under threat he may just get his revenge after all.&nbsp;A star studded cast that includes Josh Brolin, John Malkovich and modern day starlet Megan Fox. With familiar faces &nbsp;like Wes Bentley (P2) Michael Fassbender and Aidan Quinn to name a few.&nbsp; It's mild mix of Outlaw Josey Wales (1976), &nbsp;Wild, Wild West (1999) and Ghost Rider (2007). To it's credit it had great sets, location and make up with a competently written script and a great score taking it's queue from Once Upon a Time in the West (1968) and is reminiscent of many great westerns.It's well directed by Jimmy Hayward and the lighting compliments the atmosphere, especially in the night time scenes. &nbsp;It has lots of action and is laced with humour, the&nbsp;few supernatural elements coupled with some gun play keep it interesting and Hex is far from the turkey you may have been lead to believe. It's a dark comic adventure which is quite easy to swallow, and should be for the amount of talent and budget. &nbsp;With its short running time Hex is not as good, bad or ugly as Jonah lovers or critics would lead you to believe.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Few Decent Moments but a Real Letdown</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jonah Hex (2010) ** (out of 4)After seeing his family murdered and himself brutally mutilated by Quentin Turnbull (John Malkovich), Jonah Hex (Josh Brolin) turns bounty hunter to capture any bad guy he can but soon the President asks Hex to track down and kill Turnbull who has stolen a massive weapon that could take out the country. Without the ending credits this thing clocks in at 73-minutes, which is rather amazing in today's world when it seems movies keep getting longer and longer. I don't mind the short running time as I feel it something we need more of but at the same time this film is a mess. For starters, while watching the thing it's clear this was meant to be longer and more violent. The film jumps around from one bit of the story to the next and it appears the short running time was done to build the "style" of storytelling. Well, it just doesn't work because you feel as if you're watching something that is missing footage. This continues with the violence because at times we're watching a rather dark and moody film but then we get quick edits when the violence happens so to my eyes it's rather obvious that they wanted to get this a PG-13 rating. Would the more graphic violence had helped? I'd say probably so because, again, it's obvious the film had it cut out. I put the majority of the blame on director Hayward and his style. The quick edits, fast zooms and the various other "cool" objects he throws at us is just distracting and in the end they become very boring. This isn't a complete bomb as we do get some nice stuff and that includes Hex's ability to talk with the dead by touching them and bringing them back to life. I found some of these special effects to be off but at the same time it gave the film a certain darkness that I enjoyed. The best moment in the film happens when Hex brings his dead friend back to life, a friend he just happened to kill. The film takes place just after the Civil War and I thought they got the look of the land pretty good and this here was another plus. What does keep the film moving better than it deserves was the performance by Brolin who managed to make the character his very own. I loved the laid back approach to the role and Brolin's dry sense of humor worked perfectly as we do get a few nice one-liners. Malkovich appears to be having fun but the film doesn't get to spend too much time with him. Megan Fox plays the prostitute who Hex cares for and delivers a rather blah performance. There's nothing bad with her but there's nothing good either. She's obviously just here for eye candy as she's constantly in skimpy clothes and it's never made clear why she's in love with a disfigured Hex. I normally don't go for a film like this but the subject matter, cast and trailer made it look interesting but sadly the end result is extremely mixed and all in all a major disappointment. This film should have been so much more but the poor direction and ugly style just kills it in the end.</fullReview>

Please ignore/don't pay attention to the bad reviews. This was a great movie with original CG effects/ideas. For instance, the scenes where Jonas Hex by mere touch can bring dead stiff, ashen corpses back to living color, talkative life so he can interrogate them. I am not a big fan of Megan Fox, but she was very believable, beautiful, graceful in this role...The fact John Malkovich was in this movie alone gives it credibility...There is an interesting story, good acting, great scenery, photography...plenty of suspense, action...etc etc, etc...Well worth the time watching..Hope there is a sequel!

		<fullReview>Having just seen Jonah Hex this weekend, I must say I can't understand how this movie has a 4.2 (as of July 26th, 2010). I just don't get it. I've read some of the comics, and yes, this movie doesn't have much to do with them - but welcome to comic book movie adaptations (when not directed by Zack Snyder).I think a lot of people are still bitter over the extensive re-shoots and scene-cuts that were done, but in no way does the movie seem 'pieced together,' or anything like that. The pace is even appropriate. And for everyone who's saying things about Megan Fox's acting... have you seen any other Megan Fox movies? You can tell that the part was written specifically for her because she doesn't have very many lines and she shows a lot of skin - and that's why it works. As for Josh Brolin, he did a great job. Only guy that could've beaten him in this role would have been Eastwood in his prime. The supporting actors (John Malcovich, Jeffrey Dean-Morgan, Will Arnet) even did a great job. It even has a pretty cool hard rock/western score by Mastodon.So, that being said, and the fact that this is a fairly straight-forward, yet entertaining, revenge tale, I'd give it a 7/10. I could see people who don't care about comics, or westerns, or revenge stories - I don't know why those people would go to see this movie, but I digress - giving it a 6/10... or even a 5/10... but 4.2? Seriously? Sherlock Holmes sucked and it has a 7.5. Gimme a break.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jonah Hex isn't one of the best movies I have seen. In fact, I can even guarantee you that it will not be in my top 10 at the end of the year. I can also guarantee that it will be nominated for a couple of Razzie awards, but who cares? I found it to actually be really entertaining. I have some problems still with the editing, particularly towards the end when he's dreaming of a fight with Turnbull and he's fighting him at the same time...This sequence got a little bit confusing. Another sequence that was confusing was when the Natives were treating his bullet wound...It was a bit weird to watch, kind of because of the editing. The film also disappointed me with it's length. My friend and I looked at each other when the credits rolled and we thought we had only spent half an hour inside the movie theatre. But if you continue reading you'll find out why I enjoyed so much.One of the main reasons I liked it was because of the performances of the actors. Josh Brolin gives all he's got in an energetic performance as the title character, Jonah Hex. On the side notes, Megan Fox is also pretty good, and for once her acting is okay. Perhaps it's just a step higher in a career that will otherwise, like it or not, last a long time. John Malkovich is a talented actor, but we can all agree that his performance as Quentin Turnbull wasn't his best. But even the most talented movie makers and actors also go wrong once in a while, and while his performance wasn't that bad, it wasn't typical John Malkovich. Micheal Fassbender is probably the worst, and his acting was much better in last year's Inglourious Basterds. On another note, the early moments of the film shown in ''comic'' remind a lot of what Quentin Tarantino had done in Kill Bill, and were definitely a plus for me.As for the script, people need to stop bashing it. It was written by Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor, the two guys behind Crank, Crank : High Voltage and Gamer. The people who have seen all three of the movies I mentioned above probably understand that these guys have their own style, and that their style is reflected everywhere in this movie. Of course perhaps the violence has been toned down for the PG-13 rating but the style is reflected, particularly in the way the dialogues are spoken and in the way the action is presented.Story: Jonah Hex (Josh Brolin) is a disfigured man whose family was killed by Quentin Turnbull (John Malkovich. Hex tries his best to find Turnbull, who fakes his own death, but believing Turnbull is dead, he becomes a bounty hunter that is wanted dead or alive. His only relationship is with a prostitute named Lilah (Megan Fox). But once Turnbull comes back, Hex will stop at nothing to kill the man once for good. Personally, I enjoyed it, and although this film will not please to everyone, those who enjoyed Neveldine/Taylor's previous works will certainly enjoy this film. If you don't like their style, perhaps you should stay as far back as possible from this movie, because it is not a comic-book adaptation like any other. If you're sure you want to see it then I suggest you go now because at this time, the film is flopping, and to become a success, it needs money. If you're not sure, wait to rent the DVD or Blu-Ray and if you think it will suck, then do yourself a favour unlike many people did here on IMDb and just don't go watch it, because frankly, I believe some people knew they'd find it bad and just went to see it to be able to complain afterwards.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Perfectly Respectable 6 Out of 10</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Don't know what everyone is complaining about. I rate this movie a respectable 6 out of 10. It's an action movie based on a relatively obscure comic.It's got a hero who talks to the dead, evil Confederate General as a villain with a weapon of mass destruction. The villain's plan is plausible, and equally nefarious. The hero is equipped with two horse mounted Gatling Guns, and a pair of pistols fitted with mini-crossbows.On top of that you got Megan Fox. I have no complaints about her acting here. On the same level as her Transformers performance. Heck she's no Meryl Streep, but nice eye candy.Very watchable, in my opinion.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>i have wanted to see this film for a long time, and found the DVD in car boot sale, i enjoyed it from start to end, i used to read the dc comic when i was young, and always thought clint eastwood was him in the spaghetti westerns, but never dark enough, well this film shows him in an authentic way.With his ability to talk to the dead, and survive death. the film covers his life, explaining how he became what he is, i liked the action sequences. megan fox was a nice break from the darkness, that follow jonah wherever he goes. there were lots of surprises,and twists, gun fights,and general swash buckler feeling to the film id recommend this film to anybody who likes westerns, comics, revenge and supernatural stories.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As first: The actors are very good. Second: The special effects are awesome. Third: There's a story to it.This is a great movie that you nearly never see any more. It's got a fun theme: Wild west, and it is kind of a superhero movie. If you look at the new movie: Cowboys &amp; Aliens, then Jonah Hex looks way better. Also the actors were great. There are quit some famous actors, like Megan Fox, and the roles are also being played very well.The special effects I can describe in one word: Awesome. Every special effect is well done, like the huge explosions. Also the clothes and view is very western and good.The story is well thought. There is a real storyline, not like there isn't in some other movies, like scary movie 4.The only thing that is a bit of a pity is that the movie is only one hour and nineteen minutes. That is really short.So there for I give the movie as rating: 8</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>typical action movie with surprising extra's</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Your typical action film based on a comic, but with some surprising elements. It had some macabre features (where jonah could talk to the dead and he obtained quick reflexes after a near death experience) and though megan fox had a mediocre roll she had her moments where her acting overdid her role in Transformers. (not quite a accomplishment, but still...)If you haven't read the comic and maybe not biased by expectations, you most likely like this one. It has all the elements for a good action film and the his personal crusade with his nemesis general turnbull makes it worthwhile to watch.IMDb rates it with a poor 4,6 I rate it with a 6,5 (G.O.O.S.) ( for the original effects and surprisingly OK acting from megan fox and entertaining storyline)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A supernatural bounty hunter is assigned by US President Grant a dangerous mission to chase nasty terrorist</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This fantastic/terror/science-fiction/Western deals with a disfigured gunslinger named Jonah Hex (Josh Brolin) , a scarred bounty hunter with warrants on his own head , he is wanted dead or alive , reward 50.000 dollars . President Grant (Aidan Quinn) is informed of the train massacre by Lieutenant Grass (Will Arnett) and surmises that Turnbull plans to attack the Union on the Fourth of July (the country centennial). Grass is told to find Jonah and hire him to stop Quentin Turnbull (John Malkovich) . The U.S.A. President and his assistant make an offer he cannot refuse: in exchange for his freedom, he must stop a terrorist who is ready to unleash Hell on Earth by means of an atomic bomb . After that , Jonah goes to a brothel and spends the night with Lilah (Megan Fox), a bitch attracted to the scarred gunfighter for more than just professional interest . Later on , Jonah heads to Fort Resurrection and Independence Harbor , Virginia , looking for the ominous criminal Quentin .This moving picture blends action , western, shootouts, fantastic elements with hallucinogenics shots , besides a little bit violence. The final confrontation amongst the starring and contenders on the ship is overblown with amazing and stirring images . The storyline from Brian Tyler and Navaldine based on original comic books characters appearing in magazines published by DC Comics and created by John Albano &amp; Tony DeZuniga , though the drawings are much better, thus the film is some boring and isn't well paced . The story bears certain resemblance to ¨Blueberry¨(2004) by Jean Kounen in similar style, theme , scenarios and hallucinatory special effects created by Ariel Velasco Shaw . The motion picture obtained limited success, as United States as Europe failed at box office . Exciting musical score fitting to action by Marco Beltrani . Colorful though dark cinematography by Amundsen , mostly filmed in New Orleans , Louisiana. Jimmy Hayward direction is mediocre , without originality and nothing new to show , being a simple copy based on the comic books. Hayward is an expert on Animation Department in charge of ¨Toys 2¨, ¨Bugs¨, ¨Monsters S.A.¨ , ¨Finding Nemo¨ and directed ¨Horton¨ and ¨Jonah Hex¨ this is his first film in real frames . Rating : acceptable and passable . The flick will appeal to peculiar and rare western buffs</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a bad remake.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From what I know of in the comics Jonah Hex was a man who gruesomely kills his foes. It was a little disappointing not to see such scenes with make Jonah's character authentic. Megan Fox was for her part much like the character in the comic, lush, vibrant and able to kick butt. The film was a bit dark in some scenes, could have used better lighting. Still the impact of using a nation killing weapon was a good idea, albeit that most of the script was scrapped making this a very short film. That was also disappointing. But Josh Brolin did bring out the meanness of Jonah Hex to the screen, and to me that was a bonus. Seeing him wipe out the bad guys without so much as a second thought, using either a gun or knife was a pleasure to watch. Jonah Hex's life was in turmoil, to be a bounty hunter which can be revived using crowfoot medicinal remedies. I found this movie to be a good summer filler for the blockbusters coming soon. Until then, I think Jonah Hex could use a makeover for a next instalment. That I can wait for.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty Far From Hexcellent!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The new DC Comics movie "Jonah Hex" qualifies as a saddle-sore supernatural horse opera. Imagine the classic Clint Eastwood western "The Outlaw Josey Wales" combined with the abominable Will Smith epic "Wild Wild West" and you'll have a rough idea about what to expect from this outlandish, often incoherent, half-baked travesty. Despite its PG-13 rating, "Jonah Hex" boasts some rather brutal violence, but the consequences of the violence are rarely depicted. Josh Brolin toplines a capable cast as a cursed Confederate officer who has endured a near-death experience and possesses some bizarre powers. Ostensibly, this Warner Brothers' release brings into the limelight a little known DC Comics' character that appeared initially in the 1970s. Unfortunately, "Gamer" scenarists Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor have changed several significant events and characters. First, we learn little about our anti-hero's origins. Second, Neveldine and Taylor neglect to delineate Jonah Hex's obvious supernatural capability. Mind you, Jonah Hex isn't immortal, but he can lay hands on dead men and temporarily resurrect them to satisfy his curiosity. Third, whatever charisma Neveldine and Taylor had going for them in their "Gamer" as well as their "Crank" movies never reaches the screen in "Jonah Hex." Reportedly, Neveldine and Taylor were supposed to helm "Jonah Hex," but they left the film after creative differences with the studio. An American Civil War prologue depicts Jonah Hex as a valiant Confederate officer leading raids against Union troops. During his voice over narration, Jonah announces that war and he were made for each other. Things drastically change later when Hex refuses to obey an order to burn a civilian hospital with the patients trapped inside. The action is relayed in expository dialogue between our hero and a dead man. When Hex refused to carry out the order, he shoots his best friend, Jeb Turnball (Jeffrey Dean Morgan of "Watchmen"), and Jeb's father, General Quentin Turnbull (John Malkovich of "Shadow of a Vampire"), tracks Hex down after the war to exact vengeance. They tie Hex to an x-shaped cross and raze his house with his wife and young child trapped inside. Before Turnball leaves, the heartless villain wields smoldering branding iron with his initials and scorches the right side of Hex's face. Crow Indians find the tortured Hex later and perform various ritualistic ceremonies that endow our hero with supernatural powers. Hex appropriates a tomahawk, warms it until it glows, and burned off the initials. As a result, our vengeance-driven hero's face is twisted into a sneer on one side with a hole in his jaw near his teeth. Everybody that confronts Hex bothers him about what happened to his countenance. Usually, Hex kills them. Sadly, our protagonist learns to his chagrin that Turnball has died in a hotel fire. Anyhow, Hex turns to a life of bounty hunting after Turnball's demise. Hex establishes a relationship a frontier call girl, Lilah (Megan Fox of "Jennifer's Body"), who is crazy about him. Hex gets into trouble when he arrives in a two-bit town to get his bounty money for killing four brothers. Initially, the lawmen are not prepared to pay him off. They see only three bodies. Hex has the three corpses tied behind his horse, and he has dragged them through the desert. He expects them to pay him the vast sum of $100 for the quartet. One of the lawmen observes that there was a fourth brother. Hex slings a bag with a head in it at the lawmen, and they decide not to honor their agreement with him. Instead, they aim to collect the $500 on Hex's head. A man with a rifle in the church bell tower blasts away at Hex, but he is a terrible marksman. The lawmen empty their holsters to fire, too. Unveiling two Gatling guns hanging on either side of his horse, Hex wipes out everybody. Never mind that no horse could tote around such heavy armament. Concessions have to be made in larger-than-life movies like "Jonah Hex," but Haywood doesn't make anything look cool. The Army arrives after as Hex is getting out of bed with Lilah. They conscript him into the military at gun point. They have news that Quentin Turnball is alive. President Grant (Aiden Quinn of "Practical Magic") thinks Hex is the ideal hombre to track down murderous Turnball. Meantime, Turnball steals a massive, multi-barreled, revolving cannon devised by Eli Whitney, Sr., that will enable the user to flatten an entire town. The military has concealed the weapon. They feel that its power is too devastating. Predictably, Quentin Turnball thinks otherwise. He hijacks the train and uses dynamite to blow the Federal troops guarding the weapon sky high along with the civilian passengers. Women and children are among the soldiers. Hex exploits his power to make the dead loquacious and learns from Jeb that Quentin Turnbull is holed up at Fort Resurrection. At the fort, Hex boards the ironclad ship equipped with the weapon of vast destruction. Turnbull and his men are about to launch the ship when Hex shoots it out with the villains, but the wily villain escapes. Turnball plans to steam his warship within range of Washington, D.C., and then open fire on the centennial celebration.Of course, Hex puts the hex on Turnbull. Basically, "Jonah Hex" suffers from an incoherent script. We are never told exactly why the villains must fire five cannonballs and then fire a gold cannon ball that detonates the other cannon balls. The best thing that "Horton Hears a Who!" director Jimmy Hayward does with this formulaic western is rein it in to a mere 80 minutes. Nothing about this oater is memorable. The dialogue is forgettable, and poor Josh Brolin looks like somebody glued a slice of pepperoni pizza to his face. Megan Fox is sexy, but she isn't around long enough to make much of an impression. A bearded, long-haired John Malkovich rounds out the cast as the homicidal terrorist.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You know it's bad when Megan Fox shines over the Oscar nominated actors</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are times where I question myself, this being one of those times. When I saw the trailer for Jonah Hex, I have to admit that it looked kind of fun in my eyes. But I started reading the reviews and stayed away until I would see it on TV or rented it. Well I found a Blockbuster that was closing and bought the movie figuring three dollars isn't much to take a risk if I liked the movie. After all, people sometimes take things way too seriously and I wanted to give this film the benefit of doubt. Thanks very much to Jimmy Hayward for making me the biggest fool.During the American Civil War, Jonah Hex served as a cavalryman until his commanding officer, Quentin Turnbull, ordered him to burn down a hospital. Hex refused, and was forced to kill his best friend, Turnbull's son Jeb. After the war, Turnbull Burke ties up Hex and force him to watch as his house is burned down with his wife and son inside. Days later, American Indians find Jonah and revive him with their mystical powers. While they did manage to bring Jonah, for the most part, back from the dead, they couldn't bring all of him back. As a result Jonah acquired the ability to, as long as he maintains physical contact with the corpse, temporarily resurrect and communicate with the dead. Hex satisfies his hunger for vengeance by turning to bounty hunting and has his eyes set on Turnball.So the film started off decently, despite it not being a very original story. John Malkovich started off badly and ended badly in his performance, but I figured that Josh Brolin would pick the film up. After all, Josh has coming a long way of protective older brother from The Goonies into a very fine actor. As Jonah Hex he talks and grunts through his teeth and is given no real depth on who he is. He's a father, husband and soldier, that's about it. So I'm assuming you have to read the graphic novel in order to understand his character, thanks to the movie depending on you having to read the material before seeing the movie. So no character development and corny acting, maybe the action scenes will be good? No, they manage to screw that up with jump cuts, close up's and weird editing tricks.The strange thing is there was one thing I didn't mind in the film and that was Megan Fox. She's an unneeded character, but is the only one in the film who actually puts a little effort in her performance and that's sad considering she's no Merryl Streep. She out acted the veterans! That's when you know your movie is in trouble. The clichés are a mess and this story has been done to death. I don't mind the whole premise of the movie, but at 81 minutes long, we're not given anything to care about. There are plot holes up the yin yang with Jonah being able to communicate with the dead. The story wasn't edited well and the whole direction of the film is completely out of whack. I have to do you the favor of saying to stay away from this movie, I'll be trading my copy in soon?to think that the three dollars could've gone to a yummy coffee for me for 5 minutes of a smile and hyper fun to 81 minutes of a blank stare on my face and a silly cartoon playing in my head, yeah, I so made the right choice on that one.2/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Much Better Than Expected</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From what I had read about this movie, terrible reviews, box office bomb, etc. I watched it with low expectations, but it was on regular TV with nothing else going on Sunday morning so I watched. I can see why this thing bombed at the box office, between having a sort of goofy name, sounds like a kids cartoon or something, a hero who is hard to look at, and it is set in the civil war era, not viewed as cool like a current or sci-fi/fantasy setting that would appeal to the young male demographic that would usually go for a movie like this. But I thought it was entertaining and as good or better than many action/adventure here/villain movies that get worse reviews. Far fetched? sure, but we see many of these types of movies, if you can take the leap and accept the world created by this movie I thought the characters, acting and motivation kept the story going and held my interest, in short I thought the character Johah Hex was different and kind of cool, John Malkovitch always makes a good villain and Megan Fox, while not a great actress, delivered in the expected role as eye candy and damsel in distress with a little fight in her very well. In short I liked it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Comic book Western with an excellent metal score</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was never a big Jonah Hex fan, but I have a handful of the comics from the 70s and was therefore mildly interested in this cinematic adaption from 2010, especially since Megan Fox looked so good in the promo pics, lol."Jonah Hex" reminds me of those gazillions of spaghetti Westerns from the 60s and 70s, like "Django" and Leone's "Man with No Name" trilogy except that it's more modern and entertaining.To be expected, the atmosphere is very comic booky and the filmmakers do an outstanding job with the title character's hideously scarred face. It's like the comic come to life. Josh Brolin is fine in the eponymous role. On top of this, Megan Fox proves in her peripheral part that she's the foxiest ultra-babe on the face of the planet. Did I already mention this? At only 82 minutes, the story is simple and the pace is fast, which I don't mind since too many films overstay their welcome. But the writers did strive for some depth and that's commendable. If there was more depth and epic-ness I wouldn't hesitate to raise my rating. As it is, "Jonah Hex" plays like a spaghetti Western that's actually decent. Imagine the style and pizazz of "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly" updated to 2010, but half as long, no tedious stretches and less one-dimensional characters and you'd have a pretty good approximation of "Jonah Hex."One of the film's highlights is the incredible metalized score by Marco Beltrami and none other than Mastodon. The movie's worth seeing for the music alone, no kidding.The film was shot in Louisiana with some re-shoots in California.GRADE: B</fullReview>

		<fullReview>...but Jonah Hex is a great little action western. If you're a fan of the comic or old Italian westerns like the Sartana movies, you shouldn't really pay any attention to the other reviewers. A movie like this, where the director's clearly going for a style most people won't even recognize and the main star's channeling the 1972 version of Clint Eastwood, can never be for everyones taste. And how could it be, given that the original Jonah Hex was the ugliest and most anti social bounty hunter in the west? The movie didn't do very well at the American box office, and was because of this given a limited theatrical release in the rest of the world. Which could be the producers only mistake, since Hex is huge in Great Britain, Italy, Spain, Scandinavia and Japan.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I used to read the Jonah Hex series in the early 80's and loved it. When I discovered they were releasing a film version, I was ecstatic. First thing - the character portrayals were excellent. The plot was direct and to the point, even if facts were slightly stretched. On the other hand, this IS based on a comic book - so a stretching of facts should be expected by anybody who goes to see it. I found what there was of the movie entertaining and well-acted. The only draw-back of the movie was the length. I just really felt there was something missing. I don't know why it was released as an 80 minute movie. It definitely had the potential to be so much more. Maybe if they stretched it out to a solid two hours, I could have given it a full ten. Bottom line: I enjoyed the movie for what it was.</fullReview>

I thought this movie was way too short for a perfect superhero film and there were moments where the plot was confusing.This film is about an outlaw in Jonah Hex and he was hired by President Grant to capture or kill Turnbull who is bent on destroying the country using futuristic weapons and killing Jonah Hex.The acting is solid especially by Josh Brolin and John Malkovich. They did not have much to work with, but they were excellent. The makeup done on Brolon was amazing. I also love it when Malkovich plays a bad guy. Also Megan Fox was great to look at.Overall, this is a decent superhero western, but it could have been much better. It deserves a 5/10 but since I think the rating is a little harsh, I rate this film 7/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yep, as bad as expected. Not even to the level of cotton candy entertainment because, while completely unsubstantial, it doesn't even deliver a sugary jolt of fun. It tries to be grim but comes across as laughable. The comparisons to Wild Wild West hold but even fall short of that abysmal movie. Megan Fox is actually unappealing with a waist cinched up to absurd lows. Even the Hex character himself shows no real skills relying on cheap shots, gatling gun saddles and dynamite shooting guns to get out of trouble. (Yeah, I said gatling gun saddles and dynamite guns) That b-movie bad, even though no one plays it as such, is why I have to give this thing at least a three out of ten. It takes guts to release something this awful in the summer. BTW- did I see Wes Bentley for 10 seconds in this movie? Did he take a dare to be in a film that is actually worse than Ghost Rider? If so, he did it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Despite what seems to be the general opinion I liked this movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to admit that, apart from a couple of episodes, I never really read Jonah Hex when I was a kid. I did not like Western comics very much. Thus, I have no point of reference as to whether the movie is true to the original comic series. Maybe that is an advantage when seeing this movie in that I cannot get upset by the movie not being true to the original. Actually I am reasonably sure that this movie with it supernatural and steampunk influences are not entirely true to the original comic series.Despite what seems to be the general opinion I quite liked this movie. The story is mostly comic book material but then this is a comic book character after all. I thought the story was good enough. There is plenty of quite enjoyable action in it. Josh Brolin is doing a good job of portraying the bad-ass Jonah Hex and John Malkowich is perhaps not managing to project the diabolical übervillain image that the Turnbull character is supposed to have but he is still not doing a bad job. Megan Fox is, well?Megan Fox. She is fitting the character and the movie fairly well though.It is my understanding that the supernatural element of the movie is not something that can be found in the original comic series. It did not really disturb me. I am not sure that it added very much but it was okay.I understand that people having read and being fans of the original comic series would be upset if the movie did not follow the original but I have to say that I do not understand why everyone else seems to bash it as well. It was an enjoyable hour and a half of fun action. Jonah Hex was the bad-ass that you hoped for. This movie was a much better "interpretation" of a comic series than the abysmal Green Hornet for instance where the hero was turned into a fumbling idiot.For me personally, this movie was definitely on the upper half of the enjoyment-factor scale.</fullReview>

One thing it has going for it, and I say this in a most positive way, it runs only about 75 minutes. Plus it was filmed mainly in Louisiana near New Orleans, a place dear to my heart.Josh Brolin is Jonah Hex who had to shoot and kill a friend in the Civil War, to avoid carrying out an illegal order which would have killed innocent civilians. In retaliation, that man's brother, John Malkovich as Quentin Turnbull, burns down Hex's house with his wife and family in it, and forces Hex to watch as he "took away everything that was dear to him." Plus he branded him "QT" on his face, a mark which disfigured him.With that set-up, Turnbull and Hex as mortal enemies, and through a sequence of events both thinking the other is dead, Turnbull gets plans and munitions to make the most devastating weapon on Earth and plans to destroy Washington D.C. from a boat on the Potomac on July 4th, 1876, as the USA celebrates its centennial. It is up to Hex to track Turnbull down and defeat him t save the USA.Pretty and shapely Megan Fox has a key role as the prostitute Lilah that every man wants to possess. Turnbull has her captured as a way of weakening Hex, who seems to care deeply for her.The whole cast is good, and the movie is not to be taken too seriously, more as a comic book portrayed on screen. Because Hex had a very close brush with death, he acquired the unusual power of being able to touch and then talk to the dead who seem to come alive for a brief time. Just a fun, entertaining diversion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A plate of classic western tributes garnished with some fantasy elements</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jonah Hex is a short and therefor quite fast paced and entertaining mixture of a western with some fantasy elements. The classic vengeance plot is settled in a historic context that is not always accurate but somewhat charming and therefor still better than another imaginary world.The movie convinces with a very dry humour, a couple of nice action scenes and special effects and some cool gun fights. The idea of talking to dead people and the showdown sequences in a desert place that represents the gates of hell also works quite well and adds some needed diversity to this well done popcorn cinema. Visually, this movie is definitely well directed.The rest is still rather ordinary and features your usual characters as the lonesome and sarcastic hero, the prostitute with a faithful heart and the old fanatic maniac that menaces the world. The story has no surprises and can rather be seen as a nod to classic westerns.The movie has no emotional passages, no innovating moment and definitely no big philosophical thoughts. It's all about diverting entertainment, tons of lead bullets and many cool proverbs that always put a little smile on your face. This movie doesn't intend to be more than this and is surely better than strained finger-wagging flick about morality. For what it is, this movie is a quite good flick but it surely isn't anything outstanding that is worth to be watched twice or that may stay on your mind for more than a couple of days.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as bad as rating suggests</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this movie and when going to IMDb for the specs for my database I noticed the low score it gets. I do not want to argue with people since more than 11,000 people voted for this movie and gave it this rating. I guess not many people like these kind of movies. When I checked the rating for "Wild Wild West", a movie that I like too, it had the same poor rating. I think both movies are well made though. Good actors, good action. Oscar worthy? NO. But if you look at the movies I rented well in my video rental store it were mostly movies that had average ratings. I've seen thousands of movies since I watched almost everything I bought for my store and even more. I do like "Oscar worthy" movies too but not solely. Movies are also made for pure entertainment. Movies that are not complex, easy to watch and easy going. I think these two movie mentioned are of that kind. So I can understand lower rates, but I cannot understand such low rates. The only explanation I can come up with is that people don't like the way this genre (western) is brought: with modern (SF) elements. Like someone mentioned in another review about this movie: there are real poor movies getting better scores than this one. Look at some of the latest "Steven Seagal" movies. These B-type movies get double the points they deserve in my opinion.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Josh Brolin did an outstanding performance as Jonah Hex they should of been more accurate in the correct history in the real story how Jonah Hex became who he was they should of read the comic first. Malkovich pretty much makes any movie he perform in will not disappoint you and Megan Fox just sexy as ever 100% eye candy adding the icing on the cake she needs to improve her acting skills but all in all she did well so this is a great movie. I feel that you will really enjoy this if your a fan of Spaghetti Westerns, Clint Eastwood Man with no, Trinity Trologys you will really like this movie. This o jarhead leatherneck gives this movie 2 thumb up hands down. I suggest you go by the DVD and enjoy a movie night at home with Jonah Hex Semper Fi.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>IMO: Nice speed and flow in a just 80 minutes long western staged anti-hero flick of a fallen man getting revenge for family killed, who gets the girl and en passant saves the US from a weapon of mass destruction wielding nemesis madman.The lady is almost an archetypal damsel in distress if it wasn't for her spunk and little fun gun and stabby utensils. She doesn't say much and adores said anti-hero with the rough yet more or less good heart. The actress does that with flair. The soft focus lens never gets old *wink*.The 'magical' elements aren't thrown in your face the whole time and are mostly in the periphery of the steam punk weaponed action. I like that, would 'almost' go as far as calling it subtle.The only thing I could have done without is the 'spirit fighting' between the good and the bad guy. Why? To me it broke style with the rest of the flow.Sometimes I just want to watch an insignificant piece of simple entertainment, leave my brain on the rack and stuff popcorn in my head! Jonah Hex does just that so I am pleased with this movie!I read the basher reviews after watching the movie and granted some have valid arguments about the length of the movie (should be a little longer to allow the bad guy to shine more) but to me they are mostly a virally spread bunch of rhetorical self righteous masturbatory salon poppycock.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think in all this film has not really been looked at enough. People keep saying that this film is rubbish and not worth a watch but i have to agree and disagree. I think this was a okay little film and not bad to watch. The film is very short with only about 75 mins of viewing time unless you want to watch the credits. I though the film was put together with a few well known actors and actress. The acting in the film can be a debate. some parts of the acting in the film where poor but never the less it was good. If you want to watch a film and you have been flicking through trailers then just give this a watch. Its a good little film and i have know idea what other people have been watching but they must not have a taste in different types of films. I saw the trailer of this film and was a 50/50 to watch it but i enjoyed the film. Give it a watch, you might enjoy it.I have to give this film a 7/10 not because the film bad. i just feel this is what it is worth.</fullReview>

Some of my favorite movies are westerns. The fact that it combined a sort of science fiction feel with modern day weapons that possibly could have existed in the 1800's was fascinating.

		<fullReview>For all the people who went to see this film, regurgitated the entire plot as a review, and then rated it as 1 star: here's some advice. If you don't like steam punk fantasy westerns, don't go and see them.I watched this film on DVD with three friends, we all play the Deadlands role playing game, therefore we are familiar with the genre of horror/steam-punk Westerns. The film fulfilled our needs, which was for an intellectually undemanding movie to watch after a hard day. On the other hand I may come to regret watching it since every time another gadget was revealed there was a chorus of 'Can I have one of those?'The CGI was good which is to say that it didn't jar. A couple of 'knowing lines of dialogue are hiding in there, but not too many to spoil the flow of the film.Watch the film for what it is an undemanding ninety minutes of fun in an somewhat niche setting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Continent Destroyer</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>They were pretty smart with this movie, releasing it only a short time after red dead:Redemption every player of that game wanted to see this movie, in the same western setting. Honestly, i was one of them. After seeing the trailers i couldn't wait too see a bad ass cowboy with turrets on his horse and megan fox being the usually megan fox. The beginning wasn't that bad, a decent introduction of the characters and how the main characters got his trademark face injury, im sorry to say it went downhill from there. The storyline was pretty much non existent, aside from the main character wanting revenge. The antagonist is barley introduced and the viewer has no idea why hes even considered bad until he happens upon a giant cannon ship with giant yellow balls that can destroy a damn continent, so dubbed "The Continent Destroyer" by me and my friends. We generally use this term to describe any movie that "has little to no plot-line" or uses any instance of deus ex machina. Which is exactly what this movie did. Without any explanation on how the weapon came to be, why he found it, and what the hell those giant balls are, and hell..it doesn't even say WHY he wants to destroy the damn country, but he manages to get this super weapon to the sea and beings destroying Washington D.C one massive yellow ball at a time. This movie could have been much better, and im sorry i wasted my money on it, but it gave me and my friends to laugh about, and a term that we use to this day.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What is Going On With You People?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I felt like posting a comment, not because this movie is one of my favorites or something like that, but only because I don't understand how it's getting such poor reviews. I like several types of movies, and rarely go to the cinema to see commercial ones. The only thing that makes me buy expensive tickets to the cinema these days, are directors like David Fincher, Darren Aronofsky, Terrence Malick, Christopher Nolan and not much more. At home, I'm also peculiar selecting movies, but I also like seeing now and then, a movie that is just cool, simple, not too serious, but also not too stupid. So here's the key-point, too stupid, and although this movie isn't like genius, it isn't that stupid either. Why is being treated like if it was, is beyond me. I don't know if it's just in the States, or also in Europe. So Megan Fox is miscast, yes, but her character isn't relevant to the story anyway. She's just in it because she's hot, and to bring some publicity to the movie. When she's with Josh Brolin, he compensates her lack of performance, and when she's alone, she's showing off her legs and body, which is a good thing too. I don't understand how really dumb movies like Transformers 2, Wanted, Blade, Terminator3, Lara Croft, XXX and even Scary Movie have higher ranking than this one. Is this a great movie? No. Is it a worth watch movie? Yes. This one is simple: if you liked the trailer, you'll like the movie, if didn't liked the trailer, skip the movie.</fullReview>

Josh Brolin is always good value, the supporting cast is excellent and there really isn't anything on display here to warrant such venom. I have seen far worse movies earn a better rep than this one, quite what you were all expecting is a mystery to me. This movie only requires that you go with it, it isn't high art but it also isn't the turkey that they would have you believe.If, like me, you were dumb enough to be put off seeing this movie by the reviews posted here...well, don't listen to them.

Malkovich and Brolin were as good as I expected. I really hate Malkovich(his characters) except in RED, so he is doing his job well.This was one of those movies where something was always happening.

		<shortDescription>Spectacular</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The U.S. Government gives bounty hunter Jonah Hex (Brolin) an ultimatum that will free him of warrants on his head if he stops his arch enemy Quentin Turnbull (Malkovich) from activating a deadly nation killing weapon.This was almost like those Spaghetti Westerns of the 1960s with Clint Eastwood. Remember them? Hmmmmm??..tough room. Well, there are two main differences between this movie and those movies. The main character in here has a name, Jonah Hex; and Jonah can talk to the dead when he needs information. We like a little supernatural stuff from time to time. Yeah, sometimes he digs them up to chat. The action in here is spectacular although there were too many scenes that were in the dark and it was hard to see who was doing what to who. No matter. We knew Jonah Hex would come out on top?..most of the time. Some scenes may have been cut out when Jonah was almost left for dead and the Indians, again, treated his wounds. That lasted about 2-minutes and the next thing I saw was Jonah on a horse going to where Turnbull was. Talk about a fast healer. Well, we did say there was some supernatural stuff in here. John Malkovich is the bad guy but, for my money, he was too subdued and wasn't bad enough. I almost liked him, and that is not good. Miscast? Hmmmm?????Megan Fox as Lilah was okay as was the rest of the cast. But, Aidan Quinn as President Grant gave an A Game performance. He reminded me of Robert Foxworth and that's high praise. I used to read comics when younger but I never heard of Jonah Hex. My loss. I hope this character stays around a while and Josh Brolin is perfect in the role. Hey, we need a no nonsense hero. Clint Eastwood doesn't do these anymore. One more thing. The cinematography was also spectacular, and the green foliage was probably the best color greens I have ever seen in a movie. How did they do that? Very impressive. Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: No F-bombs. Some soft stuff.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What can I do ? I loved Jonah Hex !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The mix was good, so good. The western (the old lawless west, the landscapes, the customs, the horses), the fantasy (the lead can evoke the dead and talk with them, and survive death by Indian magic, plus some modern weapons being used in the past), the graphic novel movie (with violent superhero, hot pace, and light substance or no substance), and the Bruckheimer effect (explosions, explosions, and explosions, every 10 minutes, always huge and beautifully shot).The story is about what most of the B movies all over the world are about : The Revenge ("They Killed His Family", and you know the rest !), however it does have its resounding fun. The lead is inspired by none other than Clint Eastwood's historically famous grin. There is a good talk about the good lead being similar to the evil man (most of the leads ? now - are). The script makes the movie like a meteor; swift, thunderous and sparkling. And the direction is ablaze, you can't leave your seat, or deny the amusement; sometimes I felt the heat coming from the screen to me ! Many shots drew my attention as so catchy; the one outside the Whitehouse as a little instance. I loved raw moments like the one of "What happened to your face ?!".Director Jimmy Hayward comes from the animation department of some important animated movies; (Toy Story ? 1995), (A Bug's Life ? 1998), (Monsters, Inc. ? 2001), and (Finding Nemo ? 2003). He already directed (Horton Hears a Who! ? 2008). And according to the job he pulled off in (Jonah Hex) this guy can *animate* indeed. Look how despite being explosive the image is dazzling. The pace is fast but not hyped. The action is breathless yet wonderful. Among the best directors of the big and loud movies few can achieve that. I believe the next years will witness a caper when the great "animators" take the chair of director in many action movies. (Megan Fox) is just beautiful face and body. They didn't forget to make some action scenes for her. And surprisingly she did right despite being one of the worst actresses ever. This is on the account of this movie's makers no doubt. Anyway, maybe with more acting lessons, more vocal training, and more junk in the trunk (Megan) can be better, than the familiar herself, in near movies.While the evil man looks like uncivilized Dr. Loveless, of (The Wild Wild West), (John Malkovich) didn't add anything but his name on the poster. He understands that this is a Hollywood pastime flick, so he did it for the money. In a TV interview, for "Shootout", couple of years ago he expressed his hate towards some of the usual evil men he portrayed (like The Virus in Con Air), so with the one in hands; they increased one ! (Josh Brolin) sure strives to be a star after too many years in the shadow. Only in the late 2000s he did some noticeable mainstream movies as a lead or co-lead. So why not leading an action and I bet the producers loved the idea since his fee hasn't developed into elephantine yet. Here he did convince me, but with not much of a charisma or magic. The matter of talking to the dead has become quite familiar lately, especially in the past 10 years. (The Sixth Sense), (White Noise), (Dragonfly), a scene in (Hell Boy), many TV shows (Pushing Daisies), (Ghost Whisperer), (Medium). And now (Jonah Hex). I think it's not an artistic fashion inasmuch as an urge to connect, since in the age of internet and cell phones the relationships have gone less warm, and the livings have become real dead where it takes a superpower nowadays to communicate with and explore. This is a part of not the movie's melancholia, rather our world's melancholia.What do I hate about it? It's the third act as a bit poor, less flashy, and shot ? strangely ? entirely in the dark (?!). The hidden agenda of the evil man (He wanted to destroy the world because.. ?!). The editing of the lead's second remedy by the Indians then his healing (that came in suddenly). And the vague fate of not having such a big propaganda or wide release, therefore most of whoever watched it; did it through TV or DVD (?!). Some said it's very short (just 80 minutes long). But for me it presents what the B movie is all about now, enthusiastically and proficiently. Jonah Hex, I loved you. You discharged many negative feelings inside of me, satisfying the lover of super action that I am. So why nearly everybody HATES YOU ?!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Have to say that after all the negative press this had received I found it surprisingly enjoyable. Now don't get me wrong, there is a lot wrong here but at just 80 mins long it doesn't stick around long enough to leave a sour taste. Not being a comic book reader I have nothing to compare this too but did find it entertaining. Its storyline skirts a little too close to that of Wild Wild West but it has some fun moments, and Josh Brolin makes the best of it as Hex. Megan Fox is a bit pointless here and John Malkovich never really gets his teeth into it the way he did in Con Air. But Michael Fassbender makes up for that as the creepy Irish sidekick. The terrorism metaphors and hints at current problems are a bit crass and uncomfortable but the movie managed to keep me entertained for what it was. In the end all I can say is I found it okay, but I can understand why other people may find it disappointing.</fullReview>

How can anybody expect this movie to be more than it should? I have high regards for Josh Brolin &amp; John Malcovich, even the supporting cast are well known &amp; did their best acting w/ the script they have. Morgan Fox is best in making herself look good, the only thing I'd suggest for her to stop doing is the "tantalizing eye" bit. I do believe the older she gets the better she'll become as an actor, she may not have the talent of Angelina Jolie but with more experience &amp; better guidance from an extraordinary director, she'll get better. My surprise &amp; delight was when Jeffrey Dean Morgan appeared, I didn't even realize he was in this movie.... His eyes, just the expression of his eyes w/o showing his sexy dimples can immediately recognize him despite all the hair &amp; beard on his face...... Since there's no .5 I decided to give this movie a solid 5 instead of 4.5......the actors carried this movie &amp; made it better</fullReview>

Maybe I'm in the minority as I enjoyed Ghostrider and this had a similar feel to me.OK, it's not a classic but it left me satisfied. Nice effects, quirky supernatural subplot, good action sequences and a sprinkling of moral sentiment. Add in a quality cast and it's got to have some interest.

		<fullReview>It's been a while since I've written a review, but after reading all the hate that's been spewed at this film by critics and audiences alike I just felt the need to come out and defend this film. Jonah Hex stars Josh Brolin as the title character a scarred cowboy bounty hunter who was left for dead and family killed by a psychotic confederate general named Turnbull(John Malkovich) who wanted revenge on Hex, for killing his son during the Civil War. Years later Hex is called on by the President and the military to stop Turnbull, before he decimates Washington D.C. (Spoilers) using a yellow energy ball, that can destroy entire towns (kind of like a nineteenth century nuclear weapon). Oh, and Meagan Fox stars as a prostitute and friend of Hex, who joins him in his crusade to stop evil.Ya know i got to say i really enjoyed this movie. This film was pure fun from beginning to end just like a summer movie should be. The performances were good all around and i especially liked the southern locations, the filmmakers used to give the film a more supernatural feel. The gadgets were another plus like gattling guns attached to a horse or dynamite shooting crossbows, how can you go wrong with that. There also was some nice humor sprinkled throughout and the movie had a nice look to it. So overall the film was really entertaining and worth my money. Sure it was a bit too short only clocking in at an 1hr. 13 mins but that shouldn't matter as long as the movie is entertaining. So i definitely recommend people see it. Give it a chance, it's better than what all the haters say. Definite own on blu-ray when it comes out.</fullReview>

Josh Brolin pulls an amazing performance as Jonah Hex. One night, Jonah's commanding officer, Quentin Turnbull murders Jonah's family and brands his face with a hot iron. Jonah is revived by Native American and is given supernatural powers to temporarily resurrect and communicate with the dead. Jonah learns that Turnbull is planning on building a weapon to destroy the United States. He teams up with a gun-slinging prostitute named Lilah and tries to stop him, and get the revenge he deserves. I highly recommend JONAH HEX!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The U.S. military makes a scarred bounty hunter with warrants on his own head an offer he cannot refuse: in exchange for his freedom, he must stop a terrorist who is ready to unleash Hell on Earth. The Problem with Jonah Hex is that is a pretty forgettable film 81 minutes of absolutely nothing, nothing really memorable and the cast was OK or average at best Michael Fassbender was easily the best part of the movie alongside Josh Brolin was makes a good Jonah Hex and their fight was pretty cool. John Malkovich worked as a bad guy in Con Air in this one not that much and Megan Fox isn't that much into this film so don't worry, Will Arnett is forgettable and he shouldn't be even in the film Michael Shannon has a small cameo and it's not that great thank god for Man of Steel honestly and even the dude from Ghost Rider has a small role and it's not that great. Jeffrey Dean Morgan also plays a dead guy he has basically made a great DC career by playing dead men The Comedian &amp; Thomas Wayne. Anyways although it has moments that make no freaking sense that reminds me of Ghost Rider and the League of Extraordinary Gentlemen but there are good things with the film that snake guy was creepy as hell, Jonah Hex dream sequence with the crow coming out of his mouth pretty badass, flame thrower even Fox has some moments to shine not a Catwoman type of film but it's not a Dark Knight type of a film also it's clearly that Studios and bad direction killed the film where it could easily make a whole franchise out of this just look Guardians of the Galaxy for instance another big problem was that the director directed previously a kids movie named Horton and then the 2013 Free Birds he was even in Animation Department in films such as Toy Story &amp; Toy Story 2 so you can easily see that a director of this kind is wrong for a DC Dark comic book but honestly i enjoyed the film it was better than Batman &amp; Robin it the sense of being serious but in terms of being fun Bat-Nipples the movie was better i give it a 6.5 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Dirt likes dead, dead likes dirt, simple as that," we learn in "Jonah Hex," a film well-suited to conversing on the subject of death given its own lifeless nature.Based on a 1970s comic-book character which was inspired by spaghetti westerns, "Hex" makes its film debut with Josh Brolin in the title role, a facially branded bounty hunter who sets out to avenge his murdered family and stop plans by a former Confederate general, Quentin Turnbull (John Malkovich), to destroy Washington, D. C. during a Centennial celebration.Weighing in at 73 minutes, minus end credits, "Jonah Hex" still feels too long, with a padded romantic interest for Jonah in Megan Fox's prostitute character and even a canine companion. Director Jimmy Hayward tries to update the 1800s vibe with allusions to 9/11 involving suicidal Confederate terrorists, which comes off offensively trite and anachronistic."Strike enough fear into people's hearts and eventually they'll tear down the government that failed to protect them," is how Turnbull describes his strategy, which includes blowing up trains and towns full of unarmed civilians."Hex's" propensity for death and destruction over logic and story is a big part of the problem here. An introductory sequence has Hex take on a town of treacherous lawmen who decide they'd rather kill Hex than pay the bounty he earned. Hex shoots them down, which is fine, but then blows up the town for good measure. What's a few innocent civilians in the name of good special effects?A cheapjack vibe hangs over the entire production, from Hex's underbaked backstory to his left-field rescue by mute Indians to his ability to talk to the dead and get useful information. Brolin is typically stolid and decent in his title role, and the make-up people came up with a convincing prosthetic for the strip of flesh that runs down Hex's mouth, but his gravity seems wasted here.The script by Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor (credited here as Neveldine/Taylor, either out of affectation or anonymity) traffics in cliché. While murdering Hex's family, Turnbull speechifies about how it serves Hex right. As a super villain, Turnbull undertakes his nation-destroying plan under an umbrella of secrecy, even though he leads a small army prone to shooting off their weapons whenever he makes one of his bloodthirsty addresses.Malkovich's coolness is almost enough, but too much of the business around him is just silly, especially Michael Fassbender's goony turn as a maniacal Irishman with a love of explosives. "Hex" is ultimately a movie not about characters but special effects, or in the case of Fox, character as special effect.The idea of crossing the time-honored cowboy-film genre with the more recent craze for comic-book movies seems worthy in theory, but both genres depend on deeper characterization than "Jonah Hex" is either willing or able to deliver. I have no problem with a film that has the living conversing with the dead; I do when it's as hard as it is here to tell which is which.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I normally trust the IMDb ratings, and if it is below 5, then I figure that it must be terrible. And when I say terrible, I mean "Splice", "Nancy Drew", "RoboJox", and "Branded". The only reason I watched it, is because it was included in a 4-disk package at Costco, and I figured that I had nothing to lose.It turned out, I really didn't have anything to lose, since I quite enjoyed the film. I have read the other reviews and I certainly understand that there is a group of people who just can't abide by a movie being different than the comic. Personally, I think it is fun to get a new story, regardless of its roots, but I can understand that an original to compare with can bias the assessment.As a number of folks have said, this is certainly not a masterpiece, but it is an entertaining film that doesn't take itself too seriously, and has plenty of action throughout. This may be damning with faint praise, but there are many worse films out there that people aren't as critical of, so I don't know what set people off about this one in particular, but I think that the rating is overly harsh.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>ill admit, the movie is anything but perfect, but it still gets the job done. The movie is not very long, only an hour and twenty one minutes, and in this time, you see Jonah Hex, a man who saw the death of his child and wife and was branded by a man who sought vengeance for the murder of his son. Jonah lives through the ordeal and is disfigured by the mark and gains the ability to speak to the dead from these Indian people. To begin with, the beginning is mostly comics, so they didn't have to pay a lot for those scenes. after thats, its straight action, no more comics, and all live action. Jonah Hex is played by the highly acclaimed actor, Josh Brolin, who is no stranger to westerns, when he made his biggest hit in the movie, No Country for Old Men. In my opinion, he is the shining star of this movie. He really acts like a ruthless man out for revenge. He is Jonah Hex. the villain, played by John Malkovich is also good. John did a great job as a villain, but i felt like his villain was not really well developed and not really someone i would care to see go. i was surprised when i first heard Megan fox would come out in the movie, but overall, her appearance was disappointing. She plays Jonahs love interest in the movie, and compared to her role in Transformers, she is not even secondary in this one. If they were to have written her out of the script, it still would have worked without her. I felt that the films flaws were that it was too short, a lot of the actors were not fit for their roles, only one being Josh Brolin, and the story itself was not very strong. I will however award this movie half of the maximum rating, a five, because of Josh Brolins superb acting and because it is not a bad movie. Should you see it, if your a fan of the anti-hero or super hero movies, rent it. If not, don't bother. My recommendation, your better off renting the movie, its a lot better then The last airbender, which in my review, was reall really bad.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've seen a lot of renditions of Hex over the last 40 years. This is a decent DC character, and his story always fascinated me. This particular story is yet another origin story, but it's done well enough to keep it interesting. The entire idea of this character is pretty cool and reminds me of Ghost Rider in a way.The acting and story are very well done in my opinion. Everyone I have talked to who has seen this movie believe it's a real gem and that it doesn't deserve the bad reviews.If you like the character, for sure see this movie. The movie snobs may not like it, but I think the rest of us will.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>All the right components,....sporadic execution</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Along with several other anti-heroes like Marvel's The Punisher, Daredevil and Ghost Rider, not much is really said about the characters from DC Comics universe. That is except for the western outlaw, Jonah Hex. And out of all the DC Comic film adaptations that have hit the screen, Jonah Hex is really the only character who does not possess superhuman abilities (from the comics at least). In this movie, things have changed (which isn't a surprise) and it's actually not that bad of a movie. It has a lot of good parts but the problem was with how it was brought to fruition.I will go over what I had problems with first. My only quarrel with the whole project is that for all that it promised, there really wasn't a lot of action. And if there was, it was sporadic and only last for a few minutes. I was hoping to see some real gunfights since it was a western. It's not to say that the action was bad. It was excellent but because it didn't last too long, I was left disappointed because I was hoping to see more. Back to what I found good. On more of a parallel, Jonah Hex is the 19th century Frank Castle. He loses everything to one man and is from then on, destined to kill any man he feels deemed to die. It's very cool because how many slick characters do you see, hear or read about from the 1800s? Probably very very few. Playing the main lead as Jonah Hex is Josh Brolin. Brolin is able to pull off the tough guy look very well, especially with the scar. His voice is low enough and his mannerisms are dry enough to make it sound like he doesn't give. Oddly enough, I do not know why Thomas Jane wasn't hired first. Jane went out of his way to show his enthusiasm for the character and he still didn't get the part. Strange. I'm actually curious now to how much better Jonah Hex would have been if Jane was the lead. Funny as it is, Jane would play Hex that same year in a DC Showcase animated short.The villain who made Jonah Hex who he was is Quentin Turnbull played by John Malkovich. This isn't Malkovich's first time playing a psychopath but it seemed like he couldn't give his character enough energy to make him seem truly hell-bent on destroying the Union. Turnbull's right hand man is Burke, a psychotic Irishman acted by Michael Fassbender. Fassbender actually seems like he had fun with his role. However, I'd like to know why he put on such weird looking tribal ink on his face. It reminded me of the character Hiko (Cliff Curtis) from John Bruno's Virus (1999). Lastly, hate her or love her, Megan Fox plays the lover of Hex. Surprisingly, she's not on the screen as often as one would think. Either way, she wasn't bad at her character either, especially when she actually fought.The one thing fans were not happy with was that Hex had super powers. The ability was the power to talk to the dead. Actually, I thought it was neat trait. I'm not fond of changes to original ideas but this didn't seem like such a big deal to fret over. Also, many people thought the dialog was bad. The screenwriters, the Taylor and Neveldine duo didn't do that bad of a job either. I didn't feel any dumber when I heard the characters talking. Brolin had a lot of good lines.Finally, the introduction with the whole animated bit was rather unique too. It's interesting because Taylor and Neveldine would later direct Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance (2012) which would also feature animated segments. It doesn't excel the picture above and beyond but it does give the audience something new to look at. Even for heavy rock band Mastodon's first theatrical film score, I was fairly impressed with. I wasn't sure what to expect originally because the question was, how could they pull that off without an orchestra? But they did and although it didn't contain any soft parts, the guitars blazing in the background were able to portray the anger Hex had very accurately. Too bad, Mastodon could not release the full score. Their EP album is fun but it's not the traditional film score.There's a lot of good stuff going on in Jonah Hex. The characters are well casted and Mastodon's score is well played for the tone of the film. Too bad the action wasn't as frequent as everything else.</fullReview>

If you want to compare it to "Wild, Wild West" or "League of Extraordinary Gentlemen", and in ways you could, I hated both of those movies, so it's a winner there. It certainly could have been better, but I wasn't offended.Josh Brolin carried the movie, everyone else was along for the ride. There seems to be a lot of love/hate for Megan Fox, but I don't get it. I think this is the only time I've seen her, but she's not a great actress and isn't amazing eye candy. She's just there. Not the worst actress ever, not the sexiest thing that ever lived. I'm not sure how anyone can get worked up about her either way.I can't figure out why people pick some movies out to barrage with hate. I can name dozens of movies that were worse. Faint praise, I know.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Comic book movies are all the rage these days. Ever since Spawn, Blade and X-Men hit it big in 1997, 1998 and 2000 (respectively), it seems like one or two or sometimes more new comic-turned-films come out every year. This year, we had Iron Man 2, Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World, Kick-Ass, Red, Dylan Dog: Dead Of Night, and Jonah Hex. I had just watched Jonah Hex this morning, after previously putting it off under the impression that it was going to be a terrible. After all, reviews were dismal, and most audiences avoided it. The reason for this I think is that, like the previously mentioned Kick-Ass, Jonah Hex is an amalgamation of different genres and styles to produce a sort of cinematic conglomerate.The story revolves around the title character of Jonah Hex, a former soldier of the Civil War who betrayed his superior officer under moral principles. This general, one Quentin Turnbull, in turn scarred Hex for life and left him near dead. Because of this, Jonah becomes a loner bounty hunter who discovers he can speak with the dead (this last bit is partly due to the help of Native Americans). After he spends his life afterwards hunting down thugs under the assurance that Turnbull died in the last days of the war, he discovers that Turnbull is in fact still alive and planning to annihilate the American populace, and sets out to stop him as both a 'favor' to the country and a personal vendetta.Jonah Hex is supported by two things: Its style and its characters. As I said before, the film is a combination of styles. Here we have a healthy chunk of gritty 1960's western, a dose of self-aware comic book sensibility, a bit of modern era actioneering, and a nice touch of personal struggle. At any given time, we can see masked riders overtaking a steam engine train, men coming to terms with their own faults, and heroes shooting dynamite-launching crossbows. It may not be everyone's cup of tea, and it can be overwhelming to those who don't like it or expect it, but I found it to be thoroughly enjoyable.The acting and characters can be said to be both good and poor. The most impressive acting in the film is by far by lead actor Josh Brolin. Brolin IS Jonah Hex. This is one of those rare performances where you barely recognize the actor, because they literally become the character. In a sense, Brolin carries the whole movie with his performance. Opposite of this are John Malkovich as Turnbull and Megan Fox as a sort of love interest for Hex. I found Malkovich to be disappointing here. He usually gives such an impressive performance, but here he just seems to be going through the motions, barely putting effort into it. Megan Fox is arguably the weakest link in the movie, serving no purpose other than brief instances of shoddy eye-candy. Unlike all the other characters, Fox's has no motivation, no reason, and no background. It's as if she was the token girl of the movie. Her acting here is even worse than in the Transformers movies, and that's saying something. However, practically all the minor characters, particularly weapon-maker Smith and Irish maniac Burke, are always competently and usually enjoyably well-performed by their actors.It could be said that Jonah Hex is boring and silly, which was indeed what most people said when it came out. Its plot is rather paper thin, often branching off into minor events of introspective scenes for Jonah, and it adopts the 'turn-off-your-brain' attitude at certain points to make way for action sequences. However, the core of the movie still rests on the focus of its unique style and Jonah Hex as a character, both of which work well. And considering that this is meant more for entertainment than art, and the entertainment delivers, the movie's flaws are forgivable.Overall, Jonah Hex makes for an enjoyable movie if you go into it with an open mind. The story and execution could have been better, but the nice group of styles and Josh Brolin make up for this. It's no high-quality cinematic work to be sure, but it's damn fun and quite cool.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I didn't find a lot wrong with Jimmy Hayward's Jonah Hex. While watching it I was trying to figure out why everyone hated it. I couldn't find much wrong, but yet I couldn't find a lot right either. Yes, it's another one of those cases.Jonah Hex's(Josh Brolin) family was murdered by the evil Turnbull(John Malkovich). Hex died and came back to life. I think. He comes back and is hired to kill Turnbull, who was presumed dead. But he was wrong. So he has to take him down before it's too late. And he has help from a girl(Megan Fox) who he finds solace with and she likes him in a sexual way. Which is weird because he has a huge burn on the side of his face. And she's Megan Fox.That is a little thing called unfeasbile. Megan Fox would never do something as hideous as Jonah Hex. Why are there so many good actors in here(Josh Brolin, John Malkovich, Michael Fassbender)? Oh I also forgot to mention that this is a western.The plot is a mild rip off of The Crow, minus the cool and minus the dark. And it's a western. The film does a good job of taking up time, but I didn't really pay a ton of attention to it. It doesn't grip you. It's just one of those films that you can multi task on(text,talk,sleep, whatever).Overall, I didn't find a ton right with it. I did find some things wrong with it though. It shouldn't have tanked as much as it did though. There are better ways to spend your time, and yet there are worse ways to spend your time(a.k.a Killers). If you're bored and stuck in the rain or snow(like I was today) it will definitely let time pass.B-</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Losted in Heavy Metal</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I always try to keep short and to say more when I'm about to give opinion... Hex was one of my favourite characters from comics and I'm glad to see someone decided to make a film. Jonah Hex the movie have everything from the spirit of the comics. Acting is good and all keep the line of the characters from the beginning to the end. But the movie suffers form some bad decisions that makes experience not so good as it could be. The worst part is the light in all night scenes, and this film have nights scenes a lot. And the second major bad thing is the music score. I don't know who was so smart to mix apples and oranges and who was responsible to allowed that mix, but even the amateur director have to know that no one put heavy metal in western movie. Simply, don't go.One peace of advice to all "wannabe" directors: Sometimes the strongest parts can be without music if you know how to lead them to stand all by themselves.Like this, the film have mediocre final score and some parts that could be very strong and long to remember are blown by terrible music score and even worst lighting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An absolute mess of a movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jonah Hex is a project that seemed doomed from the start. It has all the ingredients for a great movie - a too-cool-to-be-true premise, an extraordinary cast, a rarely seen (in the comic book universe) Wild West setting, and a cult following thanks to DC Comics' graphic novels. But if you look at other movies of its kind - Constantine (2005), Ghost Rider (2007) etc. - it was never going to work. The studio system or just plain bad writing always seems to get in the way. And Jonah Hex is quite possibly the most terrible of them all. Josh Brolin snarls and grunts his way through a solid performance, but he does not manage to save this absolute mess of a movie.Jonah Hex served as a Confederate solider during the American Civil War. We learn through a fast-tracking prologue that shortly after the war, the evil Quentin Turnbull (John Malkovich) murdered Jonah's entire family, and branded his face with a terrible wound that leaves him disfigured. He is left for dead but nursed back to health by some native Americans, that somehow leave him with the ability to talk to the dead. Believing Turnbull burned to a crisp in a hotel fire, Jonah turns to bounty hunting to earn his living, proving highly efficient at the job. But when Turnbull re-emerges with his mad Irish cronie Burke (Michael Fassbender) and the threat of a terrorist attack, President Grant (Aidan Quinn) hires Jonah to take him out and save the day.After the quick-fire introduction that zips through Jonah Hex's backstory so fast that you simply cannot care about him, we are introduced to the familiar hooker-with-a-heart Lilah (Megan Fox), who is inexplicably in love with Jonah. They share one scene together with no hint as to why these two characters even like each other (although I'm sure I know why Jonah enjoys visiting Lilah), and are not reunited until the climax when we are expected to care about these two making it through the explosions and gunfire. Writers Brian Taylor and Mark Neveldine (who like to refer to themselves as simply Taylor/Neveldine - oh, please) don't seem to have heard of character-building or pacing, but when you look at their back catalogue then this can hardly be a surprise.The most depressing thing is that the actors do their best and are largely successful with their cardboard characters, which makes it even more confusing as to how this was screwed up so badly. Nothing is explained properly - how did Turnbull escape the fire that apparently killed him/why do we only see Jonah revive the dead twice/why is Turnbull so p****d at the government? - and the fact that we are simply expected to accept this is offensive. I know, I know, this is a comic- book movie, but the action is so dull and ridiculous (dynamite guns!) that the aspect that we expect to be at least not bad is not there in order for us to forgive its many flaws. If there's one good thing to say about the film, it's that Jonah Hex's prosthetics are good, but the fact that I'm praising the make-up department shows how badly I'm clutching at straws.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jonah Hex</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Summary: Legend has it Jonah Hex (Josh Brolin, "True Grit") was almost dead when the Indians found him and tried to nurse him back to health. Unfortunately, the underworld cursed him before he could die all the way. He goes to the only he knows how to do; kill! Becoming a bounty hunter seemed like the answer. Of course bounty hunting also had its perks when he got to see his woman on the side, Lilah (Megan Fox, "Transformers"). Though first alone, he allows Lilah to help him get rid of his enemy and the reason he has this curse, Quentin Turnbull (John Malkovich, "Red" and "Red 2". Together they defeat him and live happily ever after?This movie was directed and written by Jimmy Hayward and Mark Neveldine.Review: I found this movie was very entertaining most of the time. I'm not a Megan Fox fan (sorry Megan) but in this movie? The girl kicked some ass!! I like a strong female character. I find that they are good role models for all women. I was very impressed that this time the movie was in, she was good. I was disappointed in her acting in "Jennifer's Body" and the first Transformers movie. The second Transformers movie she better. Good job, Megan Fox!!The plot is consistent and the fighting is fun to watch, whether its with guns or hand to hand. Thought the fighting is mostly with guns. John Malkovich is an excellent villain in the movie. I think I actually said "I hate you" aloud when he came on the screen the first few times. The way that they bring Jonah Hex back from a second "almost death" is really cool too. I love that his "little companion" before meeting up with Lilah is a stray dog.To sum up what this movie is like, I would say a cross between "The Crow" and "Ghost Rider". Let me explain this though before you go "Lady, you're nuts!! This movie is NOTHING like either of those movies, especially 'The Crow'. I think you need to learn to watch a movie." Okay so look at it this way, the vengeance of both The Crow and Ghost Rider and the killing spree as well. Vengeance for family. And the curse (like Ghost Rider) and the crows falling him (The Crow). See what I mean now? Of course, I also like that his energy is fueled by the revenge for his family and the love of Lilah.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Supernatural/western/ superhero/revenge story...How interesting right?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the year 2010, the world was introduced to a Jonah Hex movie. I like comic book movies just as much as the next person, but I had low expectations going into this film. When I finished the movie last summer, all I had to saw was that it was awful. The Positives: I guess the fact that it was only eighty minutes is a positive to me. Not that much time wasted (Still wasted though). The Negatives: The plot is pretty bad in that it's clichéd, derivative, etc. If you're going to do a revenge story, try and flesh out the characters so that we can care about them. Not just that, but don't make the hero (Jonah Hex) highly unlikable. Now to get to the acting, the acting isn't exactly amazing. Josh Brolin is a great actor, but for some reason feels bored in this movie. He has a funny one liner here and there, but for the most part, he doesn't put his heart into it. He's very one dimensional (that could also go to the flimsy script though) and unmemorable (except for the fact that it looks like he has pizza cheese on his face). Meghan Fox is, well Meghan Fox. She just isn't a good actress and is also one dimensional. The chemistry between Meghan Fox and Josh Brolin is awkward at best. At worst it's creepy. The action scenes in the movie are loud and frenetic but aren't exactly exciting or original, just poorly done. The cinematography is awful. They just don't know where to put the camera it seems. The movie also has some unintentional funny scenes (Like when he goes into a town and shoots up the whole town).I do not just hate this movie because of its low rating on IMDb; I hate it because of its flimsy script, poor cinematography, lack of character development, etc. I wrote this review so that I could warn people not to make the same mistake that I did. That mistake was watching this movie. I hope I helped you with deciding.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>***EDITI did some reading after posting this review and I THINK I see what the deal is:1. If you are a fan of the graphic novel you will likely hate this film because apparently they REALLY changed it a lot and evidently added Supernatural elements that were not there. I GUESS this was just supposed to be a straight Horror / Western.2. If you are NOT familiar with the comic series, then LIKE ME you should fully enjoy this entertaining film. In regards to #1 above, I personally LOVED the Supernatural elements and I thought his 'Ability' was ULTRA-Cool! For me, if these had been left out (as per the original comics) and it had just been a 'Western', I think that I would have found it FAR more boring. Just my lowly opinion... 3. OH, and one other thing...Uh... 'GHOSTRIDER' is rated higher than this one...??? REALLY...??? That film was PURE $h!T and THIS one is supposed to be so awful...??? GEEZ... don't even get me started on 'GHOSTRIDER 2'***EDITI am truly at a loss to explain why the hell EVERYONE frigg'n hates this film. I do not remember seeing so many bad reviews for a movie that I personally liked, in a long, LONG time. Okay, I know NOTHING about the comic series, so I have no comparison or opinion about that. BUT, just simply as a film itself, I totally loved it! It kind of reminded me of a more Comic-Book / Supernatural version of the show, 'Wild Wild West' which is one of my very favourite shows.Josh Brolin couldn't have possibly been any better; the bad guys were creepy, the fight sequence with the snake guy was frigg'n chilling, the chick was hot, the weapons were the living Sh*tz. I mean, what the HELL do you want anyway...??? I understand that some want more of a hard R-Rated, ultra-violent, gruesome film. So, I can see how many might see this one as kind of on the 'Light' side. But, I personally found this movie to be very enjoyable, fun, and entertaining. I thought the overall tone and mood of the film to be very comic-book like and enjoyable.I thought the look was frigg'n brilliant! I just watched a Blu-ray rip that was stunning in every way. I LOVED the editing and effects. I feel that no matter what everyone says, the look, style, and the cinematography were EXTREMELY moody and effective. Sure, the film was super short and YES, they very much could have filled out the story a lot more and given it more depth. Okay, fine... BUT, the end result without any comparisons to the original graphic novel or what it COULD have been, just in a vacuum all by itself, I quite honestly had a total blast and fully enjoyed every bit of it.I guess the 'moral' is, that if you are a purest or a serious aficionado of either this comic specifically, or this genre overall, I suppose from what I've read you will likely be let down. Funny, many have said all kinds of bad things about 'CONSTANTINE' &amp; 'PRIEST' too, but I found both of those totally great! So, if you are just a regular movie lover and generally like the Sci- Fi/Horror/Comic genre, then I think you will find the film a lot of fun and what's unusual is that since it is only rated PG-13, pretty much the whole family can indeed enjoy it (perhaps without little children though)Again, in reviewing and giving my lowly and wretched opinions on these films that I have seen, I just state my honest impressions and feelings concerning how a film is just as a film, that's all. No preconceptions, no expectations (well, unless it is Lynch or Ridley Scott or someone of that caliber) and I try to be fully objective as to HOW the movie comes across as entertainment. Just that... Now, if it has specific highlights or things done particularly well, fine, then I will mention them; conversely, if there are things that I feel are really DUMB or NOT done very well *S*P*E*C*I*F*I*C*A*L*L*Y I will also mention those things. BUT, when a movie comes across as done well and is entertaining and to me if the direction, writing, and acting is put together and executed in a good way, then that is what I will say. And, with this film, that is how I feel...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a complete flop</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So I may be a little late seeing this one, but hey, theater tickets aren't cheep nowadays. I love comic based movies (for the most part) so when I saw it in a redbox for a dollar I picked it out.I may not have read all of the Jonah Hex comics, but I knew the gist of the character and setting so I wasn't completely blind going in to this as I think some of the other reviewers might have been.There are quite a few reviews on this already, most of which have already driven into the ground that Brolin pulled together Hex's character nicely, Fox was eye candy and nothing more, and Malkovich was okay but a bit of a snooze so I'll leave those topics alone.I'm going to talk about the plot/character development, makeup FX/costumes, and cinematography/sound.The plot was a little scattered and ADD. It seemed to want to pull you in one direction but would find itself in odd places that would take the viewer out of the story from time to time. However, the pace was perfect for a comic action flick. I suppose what I really wished was for more of the characters aside from Hex (and even Hex himself in the end) to be defined, given a little more dimension as the plot brought them in and out of the story. Every time I would meet a new character, I got excited, thinking that I was going to get more insight into the back story, either of the new character or of Hex. Several things were left unexplained that kind of left me wanting. I will give the plot credit for never lagging or leaving me waiting for a scene to finish.I, as a viewer and as a small time costumer myself, always immediately pick up on and examine make up and costume designs. For this movie, both areas get two thumbs up. Hex's make up (obviously key to his character) is extremely demanding as he speaks frequently through the movie. His scarring needed to move with his jaw but still maintain the stiffness of scar tissue while appearing real and painful and the FX team really pulled that off brilliantly. As for the costumes, I found them reassuringly authentic and nicely rough around the edges figuratively and literally. I would however, like to point out that Megan Fox seemed to be an out of place entity in the movie beyond just her non-acting. While all of the other characters were realistically dirty, greasy, and of poor hygiene, Fox had perfect makeup, skin, hair, and teeth. The costumes helped a little as they were -a bit- ragged, but an old western whore would not be quite that well kept, especially in the scene where she is kidnapped when she is "done working for tonight."The cinematography had its ups and downs. The strange half comic style drawing/half slightly crappy CG landscape rendering that was used in the beginning for a little back story -could- potentially have worked if it had just been comic style stills AND if it had been used at least twice more in later parts of the movie to further the plot and help define the secondary and tertiary characters at the vary least in relation to Hex. As is, it was disjointed from the rest of the film and even within itself. The only other complaint I have about the cinematography was the darkness of it. I watched this movie at night without any lights on and still there were pretty significant chunks of it when I had a hard time just seeing what was going on which, again, throws the viewer out of the story and back onto the couch. Aside from that, I thought that the camera angles were not particularly creative but certainly did their job sufficiently, the day scenes were well thought-out (as far as filming them at least) and the multitude of explosions were captured nicely.The sound was very good... except when they were talking. I loved the music choices, they were perfectly placed and pulled me back into the thrill of the movie. A little unusual for the old west, it was perfect for a comic book movie. As for when the actors were talking, let me say this first: okay, I get it, the manly men of the old west are apparently supposed to grumble out their words like bears grunting at each other. However, with a movie, where your audience is supposed to be able to understand your actors, there has to be annunciation. Twice during the movie I had to rewind it and crank the volume up even higher (though my couch would already rumble with each explosion at the volume I started on) and play it back to try to understand what was being said. That is the best way to take the viewer out of the experience.After all this critiquing I will say this: I still enjoyed it.A bad-ass antihero who can talk to the dead, bears death with him wherever he goes in the form of a murder of crows and uses fantastical weapons like hidden Gatling guns mounted on his horse and spring-loaded clip-fed mini crossbows that shoot darts with explosive heads?? Absolutely.No Oscar winner, but perfect for a rainy day or a night with a couple of friends over and a big bowl of popcorn.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A movie that should stay in its grave.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Once they realized its potential, they decided that they could not fathom willfully visiting that kind of devastation on their fellow man. But I can."I've (unfortunately) seen some truly awful movies this year. Jonah Hex may not be the worst of them, but it may well be the one that it appears the least amount of effort went into. From the story, to the editing, to the action scenes and dialogue, it just seems like none of those involved could be bothered to try to make anything worthwhile from this.I have no experience with the Jonah Hex character, so I really had no expectations of what this movie should be - beyond a possibly fun supernatural action/western. What I got was a nonsensical bore. I couldn't wait for it to be over, despite how short it is. The casting is inexplicably absurd (GOB, really?). There's nothing complimentary I can say about it, beyond the fact that John Malkovich managed to somehow give a decent performance in this mess, and Megan Fox looked incredibly sexy. For the brief ten minutes or so that she's in the movie, anyway.&nbsp;My advice? Skip this. It's bad. No matter how much you like Brolin, Malkovich, or the other actors, or how sexy you think Megan Fox is, Jonah Hex is not worth your time. It fails as a comic adaptation, a western, an action flick, and most of all, it fails as entertainment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>WARNING: This review contains spoilers!!! This movie was meant to be the classic telling of a quasi-western story of a man who has lost his entire world and has been gifted with the mark of his suffering and the powers that were bestowed in his near death experience. Unfortunately, the movie was not able to fully capture this tale.Originally, I went and saw this movie with the frame of mind that it was garbage, luckily I was pleasantly entertained.Jonah Hex had many Pros and Cons that give a debate on its actual worth.Pros: Josh Brolin- Josh Brolin is a great actor and gave a terrific performance as Jonah Hex,the entire film I was just elated to see what else Brolin would bring to the character.Action, Action, and Action- Although this film was very short, it was action-packed and had great sequences that left you begging for more.Weapons- A great trademark of quasi-westerns is the fact that it takes a classic western film and adds a dash of science fiction. This film had the perfect blend of history and creativity.The Plot- the plot was definitely perfect for this style of movie. My only regret is that they didn't expand to help fill up time.Cons: 80 Minutes?- This film was shorter than most kid films... No decent comic book movie should ever be put to shame by its length. At the very beginning I was upset by the fact that they had less than 10 minutes to describe his origin.Megan Fox- Megan Fox was never that great of an actress. I am willing to admit that seeing her on the big screen did heighten some male perspectives, I was still upset at her acting. Luckily, Josh Brolin makes up for her to the point where I can look at her and not care about the performance.John Malkovich- I have never like John Malkovich, seeing him in a comic book movie was terrible. I hate him. Enough said.Jeffrey Dean Morgan Cameo- Jeffrey Dean Morgan is a great actor who did a great job of portraying Jonahs best friend, Jeb, who Jonah was forced to kill. Unfortunately, the great scene between them and the wonderful chemistry portrayed on the big screen lasted about 5 minutes. I wanted more of that chemistry.The Intro- The intro was mostly in cartoon form, this is a terrible way to do a motion picture. It simply portrays a lack of creativity. And quite frankly makes the audience see less of the main character, especially when hes giving a great performance.Well there's my two cents, do with it what you will. Overall, the movie is worth seeing, but don't expect a Dark Knight film. Just go there hoping for something entertaining.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just not right</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having grown up a comic book reader I was surprised that a non-mainstream character like Hex would get his own live action film. I was actually kind of excited to see it simply for the fact that although I'm not a die hard fan, I knew the character and always get a kick out of seeing how the translation to screen goes.As the release date approached, I heard/saw less and less about the film. That's never a good sign. When I saw it came in 8th on opening weekend, I suspected the worst.I went to see it today. I was joined by three others in the theater.On the plus side- the movie looks great. Sets and costumes are wonderful. Great to see some human scenery with character.Also- glad there are no Old West clichés, at least not any that really stuck out to me.To me, the worst aspect is the score. Heavy metal and westerns just don't mix. It's just too darn loud and overrides the movie.Next is the editing. This movie had to have been hacked to pieces. There are cuts in it that just make you flinch and some of the fight scenes are so chopped, you can't even tell who's fighting or what just happened- especially in the final scene.It will be very interesting to see if this film gets an cut scenes section when released on DVD. There is a real feel that there should be more.Lots of gripes have been posted at numerous sites and I'll throw in my two cents on the common ones: Megan Fox is getting a ton of bad press. Truthfully, she's no worse than any other no-talent hot chick we see today. She's actually barely in the movie at all. But when she is, she is an emotionless Barbie doll sans smile.Brolin's make-up is, in my opinion, faithful to the character. However in some scenes his dialogue should have been looped, he's too hard to understand.I have no reason to dislike the villain. I honestly can't even clearly tell you his motivation or ultimate goal. The tension that was supposed to exist between Hex and Turnbull just wasn't there.**Spoiler Ahead!!** Finally, Jonah Hex had no powers in the comics. None. He was just a helluva gunfighter. Talking to the dead? Come on.For all the whiners out there, this is no better or worse than Ghost Rider or Daredevil. Too bad. Would have been great to see more adventures...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jonah Hex Isn't the best Movie Ever Made, and Don't You Dare Call Him That</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This will be the first time that I will admit that I sometimes give a film a 10 just to even out some wronging of the film in a similar way done prior to my rating. Jonah Hex got robbed. First of all, withe the cast what it is, it could never go that far from worthwhile-&nbsp;I tend to think that it will be one of those films that is loved later, when it starts coming on on Saturday afternoons. And it will, simply because it's so pulpy and clean at the same time. And no, it doesn't suck.Jonah Hex is based of of a comic book-&nbsp;critics need to have that tattooed across their forehead before they go in; and everyone needs to be reminded that just because it hits close to some current issues-&nbsp;it's simply from another time, one that matches ours too well for people to think that it isn't an intentional symbolization done by the writers. It's one the clear examples of people taking a film the wrong way simply because it reminded them too much of themselves. And the parallel between the Confederate States and any other American that's talked too much crap about their own country, has got to have a lot of people uncomfortable in the theater.But that's why it comes again to the second thing that critics should have tattooed across their forehead prior to viewing this film, which is a repetition of the first thing. The reason it's uncomfortable is because crap-talking all too often ends in violence, and no one wants to be remembered as the person who started an avoidable war. The Southern Armies felt stupid, and now some new people are getting the whim that they might as well.But don't blame the movie, it's based on a comic that goes back to 1972-&nbsp;and would therefore be more likely to have been a statement about Vietnam, from a counter-culture point of view. And so baby boomers and college kids would have their arms all wrapped around this one if it didn't show that avoidable conflicts always begin with crap-talking, and potentially end in violence-&nbsp;even the bloodiest war of all. That hurts the new battle in politics by making it look like maybe the new crap-talk is more like the doofy, militant side of the hippies-&nbsp;rather than the now extinct to exploit peaceful, colorful, naive, and altruistic side of hippie culture. And even if the second reason they can't have their arms around it is because even if they got into being the bad guy- which they can- still, the storyline is about Jonah Hex kicking the trash out of a group trying to destroy the capital.So basically, Jonah Hex was made into a film way too late. Had it been made before the pre-campaign campaining in American politics during the mid-Aughts, perhaps it wouldn't have touched so many live-wires and tripped into a vertiable crap-talk burial. But it will still be back, on Saturday afternoons; because, as I said, it's good. Even the wooden lines derived from it's comic origin (often mistaken for wooden acting) are written to balance well with the more gentle touches needed in screen writing. It's short and tough, like a pit bull- hits it so hard that you don't even realize how technically PG-13 it is. Everything seems made to match it's graphic novel's vibe, and seems calculated to maintain the spooky, hard-boiled feeling that's as lawless as the South it portrays.And that's another thing- it's a Southern. On Wikipedia they called it a western, but it's all Southern, baby. And for anyone who knows about Quentin Tarantino's long desire to make a "Southern", some thing he probably thought he invented until Jonah Hex came out- &nbsp;something based on a work in a field he's well versed on, coming from his favorite decade. So I doubt that Tarantino would (have the ability to) make a few phone calls and single- handedly tank Jonah Hex, but for the very reason that it proves what he seemed to think was going to be his own genre has in fact been a genre since the South began as about a 3rd of the original colonies- so it Tarantino probably love/hates it. I've been to the South, and it is a prime place to base a story out of, due to it's turbulent history and retainment of it's finer elements in spite of such.Anyway, Jonah Hex was an important, however accidental, mirror for us to try to break. But good things don't always break so easy, and Brolin's tough guy of tough guys is human and unique enough to make his mark on us as well as any mark that's been made on him. Point blank, all else aside-&nbsp;this movie was rockin' and ridiculously cool.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Such a bad movie with such an awesome trailer</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I saw the trailer of this movie, I thought it will be a great action western. BUT I WAS WRONG. This movie was terrible and short. Megan's acting in this made her's in Transformers 2 look like Sandra Bullock in The Blindside. This movie had a pretty good plot and solution, but they were done terribly. It had too much loud noises and explosions like Transformer 2. I hated the part when Jonah was dodging bullets like some retarded matrix. And when both Jonah and Megan was shooting, the camera kept moving too fast and too much. And the magic and demons just ruined it. Also the fact that a villain who is trying to bring hell to a town, who can't even fight, not even if he is trying is just terrible. Oh and when Megan dropped her ax that surprisingly fell to Jonah, that was just pathetic. This movie made Transformers 2 look like Avatar. It's not worth seeing in any kind of theater, regular or cheap. Mabey worth renting at red box or Netflix but not blockbuster or Hollywood Video. So that's my review for Jonah Hex, one of the worst movies ever.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Skip it - My undying love for westerns made my heart leap at the prospect of a cowboy super hero. Turns out this is pretty much "Ghost Rider" with a horse instead of a motorcycle. Unfortunately, it's also eerily similar to "Ghost Rider" in overall quality and general "unmemorableness." I got the feeling this was a desperate attempt of DC comics to keep up with Marvel. Some scenes are imaginative, such as Gatling guns attached to a horse's saddle, or pistols rigged to shoot sticks of dynamite. If you're watching it just for Megan Fox, then you probably won't be disappointed. But you will be if you're expecting a good super hero movie, or even a good western.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The result of a conflicted production</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jonah Hex had the capacity of a great comic based film. A fairly good cast with Brolin, Malkovich, Fassbender, and Arnett in a less sleazier or sycophantic role. But conflicts during production resulted in a half-baked movie and a new director during post-production. The acting was clearly mostly left up to the actors since Hayward was a a greenhorn to live-action. The performances aren't what hurt the movie so much as it's condensed story with a running time of just 81 minutes ! It's obvious that the substitute director decided to discard most of the movie since not a lot of movies have such an abbreviated run time.The movie leaves you wondering what happened with the 3rd act since it just ends without warning. Malkovich is okay with the acting but with what he has to work with, he makes it less campy than a lesser actor. Brolin gives a performance he takes seriously almost in a one man effort to salvage the film by giving the critics one good reason not to pan the film.The CGI doesn't look up to snuff, rather it looks like that was where the studio skimped. With Neveldine/Taylor on writing duties, it's a bit much to ask of them to script anything without going too screwball, like the Crank films. Or flat out bad like Gamer. Did Warner Bros., not grasp the fact that all good comic films clock in at 120+ minutes ? Or did they just get cold feet about green-lighting and did a half-assed effort at truncating what could have been a worthy DC feature since Green Lantern and Superman Returns were just so...lackluster without the concerted effort of delivering a film with the story, engaging plot and characters worth watching, like 65 % of Marvel's or even WB own Dark Knight franchise ?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Confederate General Quentin Turnbull (John Malkovich) blames Cavalryman Jonah Hex (Josh Brolin) for the death of son so he murders Hex's family and brands his face then leaves him to die. He is brought back to life by the mystical magical medicinal powers of his Native American in-laws. Hex is denied his vengeance on Turnbull by reports of Turnbull's death in a fire so he turns his hand to bounty hunting and spending time in a whorehouse with Lilah (Megan Fox).It turns out that Turnbull is not dead but is planning terrorist attacks against the United States on its centenary celebrations using a newly designed super-weapon. The President hires Hex to chase down Turnbull to stop him. Because Hex was near death himself he now has the power to touch the dead and talk to them. He uses this to interrogate a couple of corpses and find out Turnbull's location. It all builds to a climax of the hero battling the villain as the 19th Century steampunk super-weapon counts down to its attack at the heart of United States Government.Josh Brolin was pretty good as Jonah Hex, but his effort seemed a bit wasted in film that had him playing against Megan Fox. Malcovich played the villain as well as he usually does when he phones it in for a dodgy story. His evil plan is like something from a James Bond story transplanted to the 19th Century and the climax really has more than passing resemblance the climax of those films such as the presence of Smith (Lance Reddick) a version of the Bond film's Q character and the scene of the penultimate battle with henchman Burke (Michael Fassbender). Hex's supernatural power seemed a bit tacked on and underused but I am completely unfamiliar with the comic book source of this film. I thought that this film was a watchable piece of nonsense but at times it really seemed a bit rushed and I wonder how much the narration was used to hide cuts.Rating 6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the spirit of full disclosure, I have to say I was entertained but this is one bad movie. It was loaded with talent but the material is just soo bad and soo over the top. A good sign of bad writing is when the movie starts off with a " ... previously on MacGyver" intro to "catch us up" as if this was the second episode of a TV series. I mean it was like this was the sequel to some other Jonah Hex movie we all somehow missed. Just plain lazy story telling. There was a lot of potential here with a decent franchise but they kind of blew it ... big time. Very similar setup to Clint Eastwood's The Outlaw Josey Wales except Clint is a master at story telling.http://scottishtexan.blogspot.com</fullReview>

They're almost all negative. What's even more surprising, there are a few Masters' Theses in the bunch letting us all know why it's so bad. We should have as many well thought out examinations of "Casablanca" and "Citizen Kane".But I've sat through worse. With the exception of "The Dark Knight" and maybe the first "Superman" flick, DC Comics just never got it's movie act together the way Marvel Comics has with it's ever growing franchise. And with Jonah Hex, they're not even going the super-hero route.Best to take this one all in stride and not get too worked up about what might have been. When the dust settles, this one will be dead as dirt, or something like that.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really don't mind that they changed the story from the comics. I don't really even care that they gave the main character a supernatural power, which he certainly didn't have in the comics. I actually kind of like the power, because it fits his character very well, both from the point of view of theme and plot convenience. Plus it's visually very cool.What I do mind, however, is the utter lack of passion, caring, effort and intrigue. I know that the character can be classified as an undead, technically speaking, but does the whole movie have to reflect the fact that he might not have a soul? Of course it doesn't! Jonah Hex fails because its makers simply didn't care. It's a steampunk horror western that takes zero advantage of the innate coolness of its premise and world, instead relying on old tired western clichés, black-n-white morality tales, boring characters and a story that would feel more at home as a plot for a half an hour long children's animation episode.And yes, granted, the film actually has some really good actors in the main roles. Not that it does them much good, though I shudder to think what it would have been without them. No, wait, I take that back. This would been better with worse actors! At least then I could have laughed at how incompetent they were. Now it was like watching expensive sports cars used for mud racing. Not fun!Jonah Hex looks good, has some cool themes and locations going for it, and at least you can see that they tried to make a good film. Unfortunately, they failed utterly and what end up being made is probably the worst comic book adaptation I've ever seen. My only consolation is that I'm one step closer to being able to say I've seen them all. And that's a very small comfort.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There's not really anything offensively wrong with "Jonah Hex", but it is a brutal, spirit-crushing disappointment. Here we are in the age of superhero Hollywood, and Hex finally gets his shot. And what we get is . . . this. a painfully flat western that features all sorts of jokey elements - eyesore color grading, gattling guns on a horse, a metal score, Megan Fox, some half-brained superweapon, cut-rate CGI - but plays it numbingly serious. I've never been a big Josh Brolin fan, but he kinda works as Hex. And in a movie helmed by better personnel, he'd be great. He leads a surprisingly high-caliber of talent here. And to see those names on something so inept is just . . . what the hell was going on on this production? Are we ever going to see another Hex outing before the superhero boom runs out of steam? Most likely not, which is the really frustrating part. Spider-Man, Fantastic Four, Batman, all headed for another do-over, and a character that deserves better gets this steaming pile? We all got the shaft on this one.2/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, this is a movie based upon a DC comic book hero. Jonah Hex (Josh Brolin) was a confederate soldier but when his battalion commander decides to become a brute and kill civilians for no reason, he turns his back upon them. However his former commander catches up with him, kills his family and leaves him for dead. Jonah Hex is rescued by some Indians and brought back from the brink of death and discovers that he has the power to speak with the dead. However revenge does not come easily as he learns that his old commander is dead.It is not as simple as that though. Jonah Hex wonders the US doing good for people (namely by killing bad guys), but when Quentin Turnball (John Malkovich) turns up again and steals a secret weapon that is being transported by train, the US president realises that he is the only one that can stop Turnball and hires him.This is a typical comic book movie, and while these types of movies have started to grow on me of late (namely because Sam Rami did Spiderman, and I like the X-men movies) it does actually take a very special talent to endear me to such a movie. Unfortunately, even with John Malkovich playing the bad guy, there was no such talent in this movie, so I guess I'll just leave it at that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stylish Comic Strip Action Loses Its Way</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Another comic strip turned movie, this film is has some style with some good lines and acting from Josh Brolin. He's as close to death as his comic strip character with a nasty scar. His talents are talking to the dead who sometimes struggle and attracting a gorgeous prostitute named Lilah, played by Megan Fox. John Malkovich gives one of his less inspired roles and a small voice that tails off when he shouts a command (did he get laryngitis or something?). The film is quite stylish as the opening scene is reminiscent of Pale Rider and the town that burns up. But it struggles and confuses as it flashes back too much for a short film while the climax needed some Viagra. Somehow the end got sliced up as dog food by director Jimmy Hayward. We are left sort of like a surfer waiting a big wave that never comes. Someone said this is a bit like WIld Wild West meets Van Helsing...but its more like Wild Wild West meets the Spawn, as neither is particularly good and the Hex and the Spawn are more like angels of death. Van Helsing (how come it only rates 5.6 on IMDb? it is far superior and more fun than most of the comic strip adaptations).Although Brolin does well, he isn't helped by Malkovich who needs to be nastier. And Megan Fox just can't act. I'm shocked Jennifer's Body has a 5.3 IMDb rating; what are people thinking? It wasn't close to the average flick and Megan strikes out twice in a row with a relatively minor role in Hex. How to improve this film: 1) add 10 minutes to to end to build the climax and a bit more fight, 2) give Megan Fox some acting lessons, a couple more minutes and some clean clothes too, I mean even with the sexy corset, she just didn't look that good, 3) the director should tell off Malkovich to get him angry like a madman 4) The director needs to bring out the best in his cast and have a vision as to the ending.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Even Josh Brolin Can't Save JONAH HEX</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A Western with supernatural elements starring Josh Brolin and John Malkovich? How could this possibly go wrong? Well, it did. In an attempt to catch up to Marvel's success in feature films, Warner Bros created a film based on this lesser known DC Comics character, and I'm sorry to say the film has done nothing to help their cause. In the film, the character of Jonah Hex (Brolin) is a bounty hunter in the Old West who gained the ability to speak with the dead after his own near-death encounter. When Hex's old rival Quentin Turnbull (Malkovich) threatens the country on the eve of it's centennial celebration with a super-weapon, President Grant enlists Hex's aid to stop him.I've never read the comics but the concept was interesting enough that I wanted to see this movie. It had a lot of potential to create a new franchise the studio could profit from if it was done well. Honestly, I believe the film might've been more entertaining if it hadn't pulled its punches and gone for an R rating. The PG-13 softens the gritty atmosphere the film seemed to be hoping to achieve, weakening the overall movie. Josh Brolin was an excellent choice for the title role and I would've loved to see this be a character he could return to for a sequel. Unfortunately, the movie's poor quality and subsequent poor box office performance means we probably won't get one until years down the road when the studio will most likely just reboot the whole thing.To be honest, I'm not sure if Malkovich did well here or not. Maybe the character was just written to be unimpressive or maybe he was just phoning in his performance. Either way, I was completely underwhelmed by his role as the film's villain. Still, I guess it's better to be underwhelmed by a villain than to be completely laughable (for example, Wes Bentley as Blackheart in 2007's GHOST RIDER). Though if you're going to speak of poor performances in this film, you can't go without mentioning Megan Fox as Lilah, prostitute and Hex's occasional lover. From what I've read, the writers completely butchered her character in transitioning her from the comics and she feels as if she was shoved in last minute to give Hex a love interest. Fox's performance is wooden and she completely brings down any scene she's in.The whole movie feels bogged down with clichés, right down to the last-minute escape from an exploding ship by jumping into the water. There was nothing new here and, with the apparent richness of the source material, it feels as if we've missed the chance for a good Western action film. I could be wrong about that. For all I know the comics are garbage too, but I doubt the character would've continued for as long as he has if the stories were so lame. I mean, really, the secret weapon is powered by glowing gold balls? Balls of what? What are they? Where do they come from? They're just there, and we are supposed to fear their power because we watch them destroy an entire town. It don't believe the writers put a whole lot of thought into the plot of this movie, and we should be glad the whole ordeal is a measly 81 minutes long.The opening catches your attention and the animated comic book credits at the start are cool to watch, but it all goes downhill from there. Brolin is good, but not good enough to save this film by himself and it would've been nice if the rest of the cast tried as hard as he did. My advice: if you truly want to see this film, do it as cheaply as possible so you don't feel totally ripped off when the end credits start to roll.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Another reviewer compared Jonah Hex as a mix of Wild Wild West and Van Helsing- now that would be the worst movie ever made. Jonah Hex isn't that movie. It's not positively, offensively bad like those other two. It just isn't good. What it has going for it is the basics of a good story. Jonah Hex is out to avenge the death of his family at the hands of Quentin Turnbull, who while faking his death plans to destroy America with a devastating weapon. The government enlists Hex to find Turnbull.I haven't read the comic so I'm not concerned about how faithful the movie is or not. One problem is the piece of latex they put on Brolin mouth to look like a scar. It keeps him from being able to articulate words. Hex is already a man of few words and the fact the can't speak right does not make for an interesting character. But the main problem is the dialogue in the script. Hex's lines aren't witty, or funny, and yet he speaks in punchlines. One cannot empathize with his character. Megan Fox doesn't get to do a whole lot, she is Hex's love interest, but that isn't explored all that much. She does look great, however, wielding pistols- she would make an awesome Lara Croft. John Malkovich plays the villain, but I haven't seen him this uninspired- he's completely miscast. The fight sequences are poorly filmed and choreographed. The fact that this movie is PG-13-although it looks like they were aiming for G-doesn't help one bit. Then the are some dream/past sequences mixed into the story that really belonged somewhere else. This movie does look great, however, very well filmed. The coma/dream sequence looks magnificent.Overall a botched effort despite a decent cast and the basics of a good story. And it looks like it was botched at the corporate level somehow. It's not this crew couldn't make a better movie. At 1:20 it's also surprisingly short- although there was plenty of material that could have been included.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An entertaining move. Not overdone. Not too long.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'd never heard of the legendary Jonah Hex until I saw the DVD cover on the shelf at Blockbuster. I had a hankerin' for a western, but the civil war would do, so I picked it up. I'm glad I did; it's a very good, not too long movie.Too many people are complaining about Meagan Fox's acting; I simply saw her as a minor character. She wasn't supposed to steal the scenes; she was only there for eye-candy, and she succeeded at that. The main characters (Hex, Turnbull, dog, horse, etc.) played their respective roles very well. I'll admit Fox was much too prominent on the cover for her minor contribution in the movie.Many people also mentioned footage that wasn't there or that "might have been cut", but I based my opinion on what WAS there: the Gatling guns and other advanced weapons from Mr. Smith, the arena fight, Hex's ability to revive and talk to the dead, and the frequent humorous jabs. Also, everyone knows government(s) have secret weapons of mass destruction. At one time there may actually have been concern among government officials about the terrible consequences of the use of such weapons. But, just like modern times, those weapons can fall into the hands of madmen.The action and results were predictable, but no more so than any TV show you might watch on a regular basis. The talking with the dead scenes were very good and thankfully not overdone. There was also the opportunity for much more gore and violence, but again, thankfully that was not overdone. All in all I thought Jonah Hex was an entertaining movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A major miscalculation on almost every level</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love westerns, and I love comic books. So you might think that I liked the movie "Jonah Hex", a western based on a comic book. Wrong! I don't know where to start by describing how badly this movie slips up. Well, maybe I do. The most obvious flaw in the movie is the editing. With the movie running only about 75 minutes (not counting the closing credits), I could tell that the movie had been chopped up in the editing room. The opening bit, which tries to explain the character and his background, makes almost no sense, and later in the movie the characters make references that we never got to see for ourselves. Brolin seems to be trying to do an Eastwood impression, but he comes across as snarky and sarcastic. The movie also looks far too polished, where there should be grit and a rough feeling. In fact, the movie at times seems to be trying to ape the Will Smith movie "Wild Wild West" with its ridiculous gadgets and other similarities. I think if the movie instead had a lower budget and tried for a standard rough and dirty story, it would have worked much better. But as it is, the only good thing I can say is some of the cinematography, at least the cinematography that's shot during the daytime - most of the movie is shot at night or in dark rooms, and it looks HORRIBLE.One more thing: Can the dead really be knocked unconscious?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>JONAH HEX ? TRASH IT ( C ) Jonah Hex is as mediocre as it looked in its promos. I think Casting Josh Brolin as the Jonah Hex was a mistake. I don't get it the makers want the youth to relate to the movies like Jonah Hex and The Wolfman or even Solomon Kane. But what they do wrong is that they cast old actors in the lead roles who are not intriguing enough to attract audiences whether boys or girls or anyone. Bonecio Del Toro in the Wolfman was a Wrong choice so as James Purefoy in Solomon Kane and now Josh Brolin in Jonah Hex. Though all these actors are veteran in their own place but in these movies someone charming even old like Daniel Craig, Robert Downey Jr. or Christian Bale would have been suited. These three actors worked well for their franchise because they already had a following of people who loved their previous work, even Robert Downey Jr. did some pretty cool work in his youth. Anyway let's discuss Jonah hex, well the movie is really fast and it's hard to relate or digest the characters. Most of the times so many characters are thrown at your face that it hard to keep up with what's actually happening around. Josh Brolin did a fine job as an actor but he couldn't save the sinking movie. Megan Fox is Hot everyone knows it and she just came and said her line inconvincibly every time (Sorry Babe). Michael Fassbender was wasted. C'mon, I couldn't believe that they would waste such talented actor like him in such an insignificant character. John Malkovich is a fine actor. Overall it lakes everything what a good action movie requires, a soul and a mind boggling action. Just trash it even watching Megan Fox won't help in tolerating this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ladies and Gentlemen, I present to you the worst film of 2010. Jonah Hex is a sorry excuse for a film, a horrible mess and everyone involved should be punished. Mr. Brolin and Mr. Malkovich should know better, I expect crap like this from Megan Fox. This is such a mess, I don't really know where to begin. Well, If I have to start somewhere I guess it would be with the script. What a load of crap. If crap like this is what passes for screenplays these days then I need to change my 'career' path. I'm sure the script was riddled with spelling mistakes too, since the writer must not have known a single thing about what makes a story work. Nothing cohesive here, just a bunch of random scenes thrown together in the hopes of a movie being made at the end of it. Next on the plate are the actors. We have Josh Brolin, who seems to have had a recent resurgence of fame with his role in No Country For Old Men. Not a leading man type, he tries his best with the crap he was given. He has the troubled task of trying to give a performance with part of his mouth being sealed. So he grunts and mumbles his way through most of the lines. John Malkovich does the same old bad guy routine. He was better as the despicable villain in Con Air, Teddy KGB in Rounders and John Horatio Malkovich in Being John Malkovich, no stretch there I guess. He was clearly looking for a paycheck and decided to sleep through his role here. Lastly is Megan Fox, the girl that gets roles based on her looks and her looks alone. She scored with Transformers and made a lot of boys become teens. Here, the filmmakers decided that she wasn't pretty enough, so they must have used CGI to pretty her face up a bit because it seems that every shot of her has a heavenly glow. Her role? Pointless, she plays a tramp who sleeps with Hex, apparently they are in 'love'. She's used as bait to get Hex caught...that's it. Poor writing. They don't even use her best assets in this film. She has sex appeal and they use none of it. Her accent, if you can call it that, is ear bleeding. Don't even get me started on the casting of Will Arnett.Jonah Hex was never popular enough to warrant a film adaptation. This poor version is proof why you should not make every comic book character into a film. Jonah Hex comes off as a poor man's Wild Wild West. Yes, it is even worse than that trash...and that trash had giant robotic spiders. The ideas presented here aren't even interesting enough to worth a mention. The powers that Hex has, being able to talk to the dead, is laughable. It is an idea that had potential, but was used poorly and the aspects of it are inconsistent, or maybe just poorly explained. In any event, I was surprised that I was able to make it through to the end of the film, even with a running time of...what? 80 minutes? They couldn't even come up with enough material to fill the 90 minute standard run time? Wow, that's including ten minutes of credits? How do they get away with this?Jonah Hex is so bad it's not even fun bad. It's just horrendous bad. I actually hate myself for watching this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am a huge fan of the Jonah Hex comic series. Jonah was originally a thinly veiled but better version of Eastwood's Stranger, and despite the parallels to Josie Wales, pre-dates it by 4 years.I would have felt much more generous to this movie if it was made with another original character instead of bastardizing and cannibalizing the original source material. There are indeed characters named Hex, Turnbull, and even Megan Fox's Talullah is likely a nod to a character named Talullah Black. But here the similarity ends.Josh Brolin is just okay as Hex. I thought he could have at least dyed his hair to match the comic. He grumbles most of his dialogue, and the facial appliance does not help his annunciation. I got the feeling that he was phoning this one in. Malkovich as Turnbull seems bored and a bit out of place. He's servicably evil, but not very fleshed out. Megan Fox seems too pretty too wooden and too sassy to be authentic. I did like the 'Snake Man'.I'll not re-hash all the plot holes as many have already done. They are legion. I will say that this is one of those films where most everything is at night, and it makes it really hard to see anything, especially when paired with the spastic action scenes that seem to be done so fast on purpose so you cant actually see anything.If you find yourself curious about Hex, seek out any of the mini-series that writer Joe R. Lansdale had a hand in. Here's a quote that shows how he saw Hex: "He was a hero to some, a villain to others, and wherever he rode, men spoke his name in whispers."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A western revenge thriller starring Josh Brolin, John Malkovich and Michael Fassbender? Sounds amazing, right? With the exception of Hex's make-up and a horse with Gatling guns strapped to its sides, it's really not so great.Brolin has all the charisma to carry this off, but talks through his teeth to the point of a Clint Eastwood parody (though with half his face missing I suppose his speech should be impeded somewhat) and Malkovich pretty much does Willem Dafoe in Speed 2: brilliant character actor, terrible character.Fassbender? Well, he must've realised he was in a bad movie and thought it would be a good idea to chow down on the scenery. Way, way, WAY over the top- but in a cowboy movie where the hero talks to the dead (on occasion) things will go that way.Potentially, this could have been Sergio Leone with a bit of horror thrown in, or at least the Neveldene and Taylor version that it started out as (what they wanted to do that was so awful that THIS is the replacement is beyond me- but hey, Warner Bros are familiar with inferior replacements- Exorcist prequels anyone?).The opening sequence draws (badly- it looks awful) on the comic book origins, with a really obvious set up for a revenge hook- something that could have been better established (do we always have to start with an origin? can't we learn history later rather than at the expense of structure?) rather than treating the audience like a bunch of idiots who can't figure things out for themselves.The action is explosive, yet somehow really dull and limp- the opening assault on a small town that double crossed Hex is just devoid of any threat or tension or anything, really, that could make it interesting- not even the Q type character with his guns (Smith), which all look clunky and ugly rather than ingenious.Megan Fox does what Megan Fox does, and Will Arnett boggles the mind as to why he took a break from comedy to involve himself in what is effectively, for Warner Bros at least, Wild Wild West 2.There's a couple of Neveldene &amp; Taylor moments left in- Hex's recovery at the hands of the 'injuns' that rescued him originally is actually hilarious, and Fassbender's fate being an exploitation of Hex's 'special' abilities is quite smart. But that, based on their other movies, is solely down to them rather than the degenerate studio puppet that took over this poorly executed, badly edited and- for Brolin's career as a leading man- tragic farce.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I remember reading some Jonah Hex comics when I was a kid, but I have no memory of what they were about. I just remember the name from back in my childhood. So I had no particular emotions prior to watching this movie.And now that I have seen it, I must say that it is actually one of the better action-western movies I have seen in quite some time. Sure, there isn't lots of thing to get your mind working in this movie, but the action works well and the story is fast-paced and works well enough. Now, of course I cannot compare it with the comic books, as I can't recall them, so bear with me.The cast was good, and I liked Josh Brolin in the lead role of Jonah Hex. Not usually much of a fan of his, but he has done some good work in the last couple of years. However, I think John Malkovich was perhaps not the best suited for the role of the villain. It seems that his acting talent is better put to use for theater or epic movies. So I found him to be underhanded in this movie. As for Megan Fox, well I guess every movie needs someone there just for the looks. Enough said!Some of the weaponry throughout the movie were a bit over the edge, but then again, being a Hollywood movie, you can see through fingers for that.I was thoroughly entertained throughout the entire movie, and found it to be an enjoyable action movie. However, some of the music could have been better picked, because it seemed unsuitable for a western movie. Not sure how much worth this particular movie have for fans of the comic books, but for people fairly unfamiliar with them, the movie proved to be quite good.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Movie is about a rebel soldier who disobeys his commander's orders (to burn a hospital). later he has a confrontation with said commander's son and kills him. Commander is seriously psssd and get's revenge by killing the rebel soldier's family and burning his face. Thus, Jonah Hex is born. A badly disfigured bounty hunter hot for retribution with various weaponry and a talent for talking to the dead. Movie is based on a DC comics character.I don't know what to say.Let me try: If you're very laid back and easy to please (not questioning this or that too much; not needing everything to fit together near-perfectly if not perfectly, and not requiring much depth) then you will probably like this movie a lot. However if you're the grumpy type that tends to put everything --especially anything with a technical, artistic, or philosophical aspect-- to scrutiny; wanting to know the why and wherefores of it (yours truly, ha, ha!), you may not like this movie as much because it is a movie, in my humble opinion, that cavalierly moves along without good connections and foundation (loose writing and poor orchestration). That said, the movie features an interesting idea with some imagination, a likable leading man with a great voice, and a sublimely beautiful leading lady --But, alas! They needed a more thoughtful script and director.The film, in short, lacks believability.A good magician, for instance, is able to take you in; and you want to be taken in and awed; have your normal belief about what is possible and what is not suspended. This would have happened with this movie with a more thoughtful script and better direction.Finally: "I know nothing, absolutely nothing (anyone remember Hogan's Heroes) about making movies. NOTHING, I tells ya! Absolutely NOTHING!" The above is just my personal impression. You might have to see the movie yourself and make up your own mind which is what I did after reading other IMDb reviewers. Love, Boloxxxi.</fullReview>

John Malkovich, in very ugly makeup phones in his role as insane Confederate General Turnbull. Megan Fox? She's a beautiful woman, but not much of an actress. The film runs 81 minutes but feels like 180. The story of Turnbull's attempts to commandeer a "super weapon" to attack Washington, DC during Centennial celebrations is undernourished. It also seems the constant cuts away from violent acts (to gain a PG-13 rating) may have unfortunately taken some of the connective tissue that might have let the story make a bit more sense. Don't look for a sequel, but it might make an interesting project for the small screen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jonah Hex is the type of film that has a cool idea and a good cast and still manages to fall flat right on its face. In it, Josh Brolin stars as Jonah Hex, a man whose face gets messed up when a terrorist named Quentin Turnbull (John Malkovich) kills Jonah's family and burns his face. This is a set up for a movie that could potentially be awesome, but unfortunately, it is far from it. There are a ton of problems I had with the film, but I don't feel like typing 10 pages of flaws, so I will name the main ones. Thus the top 5 flaws of Jonah Hex. Enjoy... (1) The face of Jonah Hex, although supposed to look odd, looks too odd and made me want to vomit. (2) The cast, with great actors like Brolin, Malkovich, and Will Arnett, feels bland and uninteresting. (3) The film's sloppily edited and shot in a frantic, shaking cam way that is simply a disaster. (4) The film's 75 minute running time allows nothing to happen. (5) The film is just plain boring. As for Megan Fox, she's great to look at and just like every guy, I like to see her in a corset, but she's not an actress. Megan Fox looks great but ultimately, simply put, can not act. I told my friends that the film was terrible, and they told me I should have seen that by the trailer. I personally thought the trailer was cool, but unfortunately, then I'd be judging a book by its cover because this film really is terrible.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Cool movie; scary at first. Hex one driven SOB. Malkovich his usual comedic villain self. Girlfriend at house of ill repute stunning with her knockout figure and weapons ability (it ain't true that blondes have more fun). Take it from a brunette (myself) who knows. This lady could fight with the best of them, and she was kick-*** to her attackers. Hex held a special place in her heart. Business is business, though, and she had to have lots of customers in order to pay for that great wardrobe, lol. Cool how she kept that money organized and put away. All those guys fighting to spend time with her.... She was so rich, she could have been mayor of the town -- or at least buying all the saloons and chicken ranches.Why all the negative reviews? I realize this is no song and dance movie, as would be my favorite, as you well know. Don't ask this movie to be more than it is. It is a tongue-in-cheek satire of bounty hunters (with hearts of gold) in the U.S. Old West. It is not the real Old West, however, what with all those futuristic weapons used by Hex and Malkovich, et al. I half expected sci-fi Hex to travel to the 2010 future for an after-session cigarette. Anyway, this was good vs. evil, and always the good wins.The prosthetic makeup job on Hex was outstanding. Hope that face flap wasn't too painful. I am sure, though, that the paycheck was enough to pay some bills.That this movie did poorly at the box office on the first go-round: I guess with little publicity, what did they expect? I had never heard of it. No advertising, no results. If you don't advertise, you can't sell anything.This movie is pure entertainment. I went coz it was at the cheap movie on a Monday. I thought, what the hey. The son of James Brolin, and comic-crazy-insane Malkovich I had seen in Dangerous Liaisons. Only Malkovich could play the bizarre lunatic as seen in this movie. His getting the big sqeeze toward the end was totally hilarious. Finally scenes with Hex and Malkovich (I know, character and actor) reminded me a lot of Peter Pan vs. Captain Hook.The portrayal of President Grant was done tastefully and well. Situation reminded me of old Batman or Superman shows: "Help!! There's too much crime. Find me a caped crusader to put out the lights of the bad guys. If you find Mr. Super Hero, I promise he won't have to do any prison time for past sins and discretions!!!"Finally, the dead guys/live guys/dead guys were pure hilarity. All the makeup jobs were good. The humor was so over-the-top, and dead-when-necessary was a good use of dark gray theatrical makeup. This was the sense-memory part: actors playing dead don't really smell as bad as they look. You knew these guys weren't embalmed, and that the flies and/or worms were doing a great number on them by the time Hex showed up and squeezed some confessions and explanations out of them. Now I'm dead; now I ain't.10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't really know where to start with this one. I came into the movie not expecting much, and that's essentially what I got.It saddens me to see the talents of Josh Brolin and John Malkovich go to waste in a brainless comic book movie. Basically, Josh Brolin plays Jonah Hex, who accidentally (I think?) killed Quentin Turnball's (played by John Malkovich) son, and Hex's family is subsequently killed in revenge by Turnball. However, before killing Jonah's family and leaving him to die, Turnball brands him with his initials so that he'd forever know who he wronged, or something.Then the opening exposition claims that Turnball perished in a fire, or something, and that's where I found the first major problem with the film: the first act is essentially aimless, as Jonah Hex basically wanders around the Western landscape (and meets up with Megan Fox, since they apparently have an undisclosed past relationship) for reasons I cannot recall.However, and I think before he meets with Megan Fox (who can't carry an accent to save her life), he goes to a Podunk desert outpost and shoots up the denizens with two horse-mounted, hand-cranked machine guns (which is actually awesome - one of the few good things about the movie). While this is cool, it ultimately foreshadows the true spirit of this film: flashy, but with little substance.It's like having a Fourth of July fireworks show in the dead of winter, and some of the fireworks misfire and burn down the neighborhood. Disastrous, but entertaining (if you have a dark sense of humor), if you're at a distance.Okay, maybe that's not a fair assessment of Jonah Hex, since it's a very stupid - but benign - film. Stupid, since the plot, as you may have surmised by now, is extremely shoddy and scatterbrained. The ultimate plot of the movie is about Turnball being alive, somehow, and wanting to blow up Washington, DC (more specifically, the Capitol Building) for revenge after the Confederates lost the Civil War.Somehow Turnball got a hold of Dragon Balls and the schematics for a 19th century Death Star (invented by Eli Whitney, no less), and uses them from a large series of cannons to eviscerate all that cross his path - and are within firing range. And Jonah Hex wants to get revenge for Turnball nearly killing him, by killing Turnball.Like I said, Brolin's talents are wasted on this movie, as an okay portrayal of a sullen and deadpan cowboy can't save a movie whose script was written by a schizophrenic pyromaniac cowboy. The same goes with Malkovich, who also looks really awkward with a bald spot and long hair.Oh, and Megan Fox. It seems like she really enjoys getting casted in bad movies. If you're 13 and going for the hopes of seeing some of Ms. Fox's skin, I have to say that you'll be disappointed. But I doubt anyone is going to go in hopes of seeing some good acting out of her.Also, I can't recall the order of things in the movie because the sequences were seemingly smashed together without any thought of how they would flow together as a final product. If this movie were a river, it'd feature white water rapids, with the occasionally piranha mixed in.So, if this movie is so damn terrible, why the 4 out of 10? Because, all in all, and despite it's gaping flaws, this is at heart a popcorn movie. It's brain dead, but if you like explosions and ridiculous Westerns, you may enjoy Jonah Hex.And, like my title for this review, this movie is tripe: the presentation is poor, it's lined with crap, and although it may briefly tie you over until your next meal, you'll leave hungry, and trying not to think about what you just consumed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I saw this movie I thought it was fantastic. I still do. It gives us a nice change from seeing animated versions of Jonah Hex.Now Josh Brolin was a good choice, in fact he was as good a choice as George Clooney as Batman, better than Michael Keaton and Val Kilmer, but that's not the point. The point is that Jonah Hex is the character he was in the comics. If you ask me the way they made him seem like a "Van Helsing rip-off" as the critics/idiots say, is more of a nod to the comic series entitled "Hex" in which Jonah is transported into the future and becomes a Mad Max type of character. It was also interesting of how Jonah had the power to briefly bring the dead back to life. Maybe DC will make an Eleseworlds storyline using that idea for Jonah. Furhter more the minor of change of how he got the scar and why he has his vendetta with Turnbull was interesting.Megan Fox as Tallulah Black was an interesting choice. When I first heard she was going to be in this I said "What the ugly girl from Transformers?", when I saw her in this I thought she was a good choice. Alright maybe she was missing the scars that Tallulah had in the comics but I think that if they had that in the movie the critics would have criticized this wonderful piece of work even more.As for John Malkovich, what can I say? He was made for the role of Turnbull and he also made it more interesting than in the comics. But you will have to decide that bit for yourself.Anyways it is a good movie, my rating is 10/10. See it, love it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hands down worst movie ever made.... The acting looked like something out of a first grade play and the props appeared to be very cheap. Nothing was explained whatsoever by the childish dialogue and there seemed to be myriad holes in the superficial plot which failed to explain even the simplest questions that a viewer may have. Jonah's power was never explained nor were the roles of the Indians in the movie nor was the surface even scratched about how the weapon worked which just made the movie seem surreal and almost comical because things just seemed to happen without reason but just merely because it seemed convenient for the writers. If this movie was a comedy and Megan Fox talked less and got naked more perhaps it would deserve more than one star.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, here's the thing about Jonah Hex. The film is dark. I'm not sure if it's the mood I was in, but the film just struck a chord with me. Jonah Hex has lost everything to his former commander in the war. Hex basically turned his back on his unit in the war because he could no longer, in good conscience follow orders that involved killing innocents. There's one thing about killing soldiers, but burning down churches and school, that's where he had to draw the line. This is where the conflict begins. Quentin Turnbull loses his son in the process at the hands of Hex and in return he burns down his house with his family in it and leave him a scar for good measure. Hex then gets rescued by the Indians and through their healing he can now speak to the dead.I enjoyed Jonah Hex because it was acted well, the story intrigued me and it flowed mellifluously. I know this is contrary to what everyone says about this, but Jonah Hex has a lot of the same themes as Gladiator. Two men, former friends, now at odds with each other and each looking for a reckoning.Hex is a deeply disturbed man and played by Brolin, he comes off as a man who has accepted his fate. He is an outlaw, he is wanted, he is scarred on the outside and the inside and he is hellbent on revenge. It consumes him. Hex is written well but Brolin breathes life into him. Malkovich is his usual brooding self. His character in here reminded me of his Boothe character in In The Line of Fire. Even Fox, given her limited script to work with, is a lot of fun in the film.Another very good thing about Hex is the photography and the overall look to the film. This is the south where people in the 1800's dressed in long dresses and black clokes. In this film, people look hot. The landscape looks unforgiving and the air even seems like it has a major role in the film.I liked Jonah Hex immensely. It might not make my top ten of the year by the time the calendar hits January 1st, but right now it is one of the 10 best films I've seen this year.8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Here's what I remember- Megan Fox has dead eyes. She is bad at acting in general, and when I saw this movie, I remember her not acting well, and wearing old timey clothes. The credits say John Malkovich is in this movie, nothing, I remember nothing, and he can act, he's super good at acting, nothing, I'm drawing a blank. But like any action sequence or bit of dialog, I could not tell you a single thing. Michael Fassbender is in this movie another great actor, I don't know what he does in this movie or why. Stuff happens, for sure, but I don't know what that stuff is, I'm assuming people ride horses real fast and shoot guns. I bet there is a train and a huge explosion, maybe at the same time, I don't know.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm no big fan of comic book adaptations, but even by the standards of the genre, JONAH HEX is a terrible film. I should have guessed that the taint of Neveldine &amp; Taylor (responsible for directing CRANK: HIGH VOLTAGE and GHOST RIDER: SPIRIT OF VENGEANCE) was on this one, as it has the same bargain basement quality, hyperactive child look and feel. Even if they didn't direct (that job went to a Pixar animator, of all people) the film still looks like one of their efforts.The story is about a scarred, supernatural gunslinger looking for revenge on the guys who murdered his wife. Josh Brolin plays it gruff and miserable, and is just about passable; given that he's virtually unrecognisable beneath the makeup, I guess he gets away with it. The supporting cast aren't so lucky. John Malkovich hams it up as the bad guy, and as for Megan Fox, well she appears to have the kiss of death in terms of the quality of the films in which she stars. The only person who comes away with any credibility is Michael Fassbender, whose henchman villain is more menacing than the chief bad guy.Elsewhere, the film is a mess of poorly-shot action and endless CGI. 90% of the thing is shot in near pitch blackness so you can't really see what's going on, and you easily miss cameoing stars like Michael Shannon and Jeffrey Dean Morgan. The action is an awful, over-directed mess, with an emphasis on boring CGI explosions and the like, and as for the story...well, what story? Give this mess a miss at all costs.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jonah Hex (2010): Dir: Jimmy Hayward / Cast: Josh Brolin, John Malkovich, Megan Fox, Michael Fassbender, Will Arnett: Obscure comic book superhero made into an embarrassing showcase and deserving box office bomb. Jonah Hex has the ability to communicate with dead people after being put to death himself. He was forced to watch his wife and son burn to death. Now he wants revenge on those responsible. Directed to uninspired heights by Jimmy Hayward with superb special effects and facial makeup on Josh Brolin as Hex. Brolin is basically a one man killing machine as Hex and nothing more. John Malkovich is wasted as a cardboard villain threatening mankind with a doomsday device. Can he not come up with a better plan? It is depressing witnessing an actor of Malkovich's calibre wasted in shameless world domination schemes that were made fun of in Austin Powers. Megan Fox is fetching yet laughable as a feisty prostitute. She is yet another one of these women whom appears totally sexual yet dislikes the attention and when pressured she waves a knife about as to make viewers believe that she is tough as oppose to a joke. Michael Fassbender also appears for all the good it will do him. Will Arnett enlist in Jonah Hex's services but what he should have done is enlist in an agent that doesn't dupe him into projects like this. Superhero films are usually the item of profit but when viewers are mostly unfamiliar with it then the filmmakers are potentially kicking themselves in the ass by even thinking it will be a hit. The result is an idiotic pointless contraption should be hexed with a hatchet. Score: 2 / 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Once again DC Comics took another try with one of their comic book characters and give them their own motion picture.This time however we get Jonah Hex a character I never knew existed in the DC world because all I knew were Batman, Superman and others After watching this movie now I know why I haven't heard of Jonah Hex.But from what I have learn from both the movie and research on the comic character himself is that he's a western comic book anti-heroHex is a surly and cynical bounty hunter whose face is horribly scarred on the right side. Despite his poor reputation and personality, Hex is bound by a personal code of honor to protect and avenge the innocent.Now the movie has Josh Brolin playing the part of Jonah Hex and some praise his performance and thought he was the right actor for the role, I will have to agree he did a good job as the anti-hero of the film. He has a woman who works as a call girl Lilah played by Megan Fox.At the time I watch this movie it was because Megan Fox was in it and she did have some fair acting in the film as well as having a clever girl moment in the film. The film's main antagonist is Quentin Turnbull played by John Malkovich and he is a sick monster in the film and John deliver an twisted performance in the film. But the performance is not the three main cast members who give some good performance in the film the film's problem is the film itself it has too many dark scenes and graphic to boot, there also scenes that prove to be too intense for movie goersAnd I don't know how many know of Jonah Hex it's one of those characters you either know about or don't know about either way this film will not make you a fan of Jonah Hex because the script feels plain as the best word I can give it. Jonah Hex also has some powers like he can bring the dead back to life for just a few moments to gain informationIt's just hard to take this film even seriously, it just feels broken like they wanted to make a movie just to get a paycheck and to bring in on Megan's success in the "Transformers" filmsOverall the film is still graphic and hard to even consider serious but Josh, John and Megan performances are the only thing worth left to say about this film.I give Jonah Hex an 5 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Confederate commanding officer Quentin Turnbull (John Malkovich) kills Jonah Hex (Josh Brolin)'s family and brands him after he refused an order and killed Turnbull's son who was actually Hex's friend. He is saved by Indians who impart him the ability to communicate with the dead. Turnbull supposedly died after the war and Hex becomes a bounty hunter. Turnbull is actually alive and with his men, he steals a secret advance weapon to attack on the 4th of July. President Grant sends Lieutenant Grass (Will Arnett) to find Hex to stop Turnbull. Hex is at a brothel with prostitute Lilah (Megan Fox).The movie is extremely thin with a plot that is way too simple and characters that are one dimensional. It feels disjointed and mostly, it feels half-finished. The 81 minute running time can attest to that. It still runs out of steam pretty quickly. Brolin is grumpy with only half of a face. Fox has limited screen for both good and bad. Malkovich and Fassbender are capable villains. There is some action but it's not terribly exciting. The problem is that the characters are flat and not that interesting.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wanted to love this movie, I really did. But it is such a mess that I can barely even find some kind of silver lining in it. I am a huge fan of the character of Jonah Hex, not only because he is a badass cowboy, but I have always found him intriguing whether it'd be in a cartoon or comic. Yet this movie takes the character and just f***s everything up. Okay, to cut the movie some slack, Josh Brolin does a decent job as Jonah. But the script is so off that he doesn't get to give the perfect Jonah hex performance I thought he would. But overall he is decent. It is also a western which is my favorite overall genre of movies. And while the soundtrack doesn't fit too well, the songs by metal band Mastodon aren't too bad. Now to the stuff that is bad; EVERYTHING ELSE! I am sorry, but everything in this movie (that wasn't mentioned in the previous paragraph) is complete s***. I can't find anything good in this movie and therefore this movie pisses me off. I do not recommend this movie. It sucks. Stay away!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoilers guys if you haven't seen this movie don't read this review. This movie is a horrendous hellhole! While on the surface the comics look like your garden variety westerns, in reality they're nothing but they were weird, unpredictable western tales of excitement. The movie is the complete opposite, while Josh Brolin does an excellent job playing Jonah Hex, everything around him is dull, generic, and predictable. Their are a grand total of two count them, TWO cool scenes in this movie and neither of them, take place near the climax. The only other exception to the blandness is Michael Fassbender, but his character isn't given enough screen time. Seriously all this movie did was remind of Wild Wild West, and how I wished I was watching a better western like Tombstone. I would gladly like a reboot to this movie with Josh Brolin still playing Hex. However can we please keep Megan Fox out of comic book movies, I can think of over a dozen sci fi fan boy, favorites that would be better for her role. Should I even bring up the superpowers in this movie, let me just say out of 20 years of comic books made for this character, Jonah Hex has never needed to rely on such nonsense, AND HE NEVER WILL! Seriously guys stick with the comics and the animated series and ride off into the sunset away from this crap.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie wasn't quite as bad as the "experts" made it out to be but it was still far from a good movie. The action sequences and fight scenes are decent, the acting is good enough, and the character's back story is interesting. The execution of it all is poor and this is one of the few movies where it's nice that it's so short. The movie was about 70 minutes... much longer and it would've stunk. One of the only bright spots is Megan Fox. She always gets a bad rap from the critics for some reason but she's a capable actress that is never the weakest one on screen. She is stunning though and that never hurts. Overall, I don't think this is a story that translates well to the big screen. Talking to dead people, being nearly invincible, and crows helping you along your way may work in the comic books but on film it just feels silly. Some hardcore fans of the comics might like it but most will get bored with it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all, this movie wasn't as bad as I expected it to be. It had a very bad (4.7 or something) rating in IMDb, so I must admit, I didn't buy the DVD, I downloaded the film. Now I regret it, because the creators of Jonah Hex deserve the money for this one and a half hours of entertainment. This is why I promise to get the DVD as soon as I have the chance.The film wasn't boring at all, it had good fight scenes, and was like any average comic-book adaptation (it doesn't reach the level 300 or Sin City, but certainly tops Ghost Rider). Getting the great Josh Brolin for the leading role was truly a positive aspect of the film, as well as the stunning Megan Fox. Apart from her looks she doesn't have much talent, but I think she was good enough in this film. But on the contrary, the respected actor John Malkovich didn't do a very good job. Any other actor could've pulled something like that off, so why get him? He played the role with a blank face throughout the whole movie, he annoyed me so much. He played this character the same way he played the king in Eragon. Anyway, the crown jewel of the cast was, without a doubt, Michael Fassbender. He made a splendid performance.The story didn't have much to it. A man, Jonah Hex, committed treason by killing the son of the general, because he didn't want to burn down the hospital with innocent people in it. So the general murders the family of Hex and burns a mark on his face. Jonah Hex gains the special ability to talk to the dead and after the assumed death of the general he turns to be a bounty hunter. It turns out that the general is alive, and the government needs Jonah to get rid of him. He accepts, because he seeks revenge. The dialogs could've been funnier and more clever, the fight scenes weren't very realistic and the montage-like editing was annoying sometimes.The film had some good scenes, cinematography and actors. All in all it wasn't a bad film, but not great either. Good for a one time view.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's not that Jonah Hex is a bad film. It's just not terribly good.Sure, there are special effects galore, action by the bucket-load and a plentiful supply of eye-candy. But despite all that, and a simple, but coherent, plot, Jonah Hex fails to engage the viewer very well.Brolin's titular character is dour and expressionless to the point of being uninteresting. Despite the tragedy that made him, its almost impossible to feel for the character. Megan Fox's pseudo-love interest prostitute is equally bad at evoking much sympathy from the viewer.The plot, as I say, is simple. Basically the War on Terror comes to cowboy-land. Add in a dash of the supernatural (which is poorly under-utilized) and the recipe should make for a solid actioner. But again, despite the decent pacing, the movie feels flat and dull.The running time for this is barely eighty minutes, yet at least twice I found myself wondering how much longer it would go on. That's not a good sign! As I say, not a terribly awful film, but not terribly good either. A nothing film, if you like. Has all the right ingredients, but this is one soufflé that just didn't rise.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I remember the first time I saw the previews for Jonah Hex, and I'm sure you might have seen it too. It had shown, in the brief flashes of a 30 second commercial, a scene where the aforementioned lead is shown, on horseback, cranking the handles of two Gatling guns along the back of a rearing horse. I think people that went into this movie thinking it was going to be a serious picture were probably the same misinformed people who thought a movie like "The Watchmen" was going to be a action packed superhero movie for kids based entirely on the fact that everybody was in costume.Jonah Hex is a sci-fi western quite unlike any other. In fact, I would be more inclined to think less about The Good, The Bad and The Ugly or Once Upon a Time in the West and more along the lines of Hellboy or The Crow when seeing this movie. The Story begins almost immediately as Jonah Hex (Josh Brolin), tied up outside his home and approached by a villainous Confederate general, Quentin Turnbull (John Malkovich), who we learn, is proclaiming vengeance for the death of his son, kills the only family Hex had, and then branding him with a mark he will never forget.Supranaturally, Hex dies and is brought back to life by a Native American tribe. Hex, reborn, now has the ability to speak to the dead, and his first order of business; Find and kill Quentin Turnbull.I will say right now, this movie had no aspirations of being serious. Even in the opening credits, the Warner Brothers logo comes up and the sound of "As Time Goes By" is played on a swaggering guitar more suited for the score of Raising Arizona than a comic book movie, or even a western, for that matter. That should be an indicator that this movie is not going to be a real serious affair. Hell, Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World did it to the Universal Logo, and that was a blast.The film is actually just fine. It's not great, but it's not utterly horrible, and everybody involved seems to do, well, okay, not great, but given the script by Nevaldine and Taylor (Who wrote and directed Gamer and Crank's 1 &amp; 2), What else can you complain about?The problem with the movie is that it is a cash-in. It has to be, because if anyone truly respected the source material, we would have had more told to us about Jonah himself, or the hooker with a heart of gold, Lilah (Megan Fox from Transformers), or Quentin Turnbull himself. In Fact, Jonah's story in the beginning is told with two minutes of animated visuals, so instead of showing us like a Superhero movie might do, this one tells us. The movie score seems to mix together a traditional western sound in some parts, but it's mostly electric guitar chords, which told me the movie is, again, a cash-in. The problem with this movie is that is was written as a sequel and not as a real origin story. Had the movie been written as a real origin story, We would have seen Jonah Hex develop his abilities as a speaker of the dead instead of telling us; We would have learned how Lilah and Jonah are so comfortable with one another, and we could have understood the story a little bit more and it wouldn't have had to been so frantic in its presentation.Strangely enough, though I criticize everything wrong with it, I just can't get myself to give it the truly negative review I want to give it. The movie isn't a brain drain, more like a brain shut off; you go in for about 1 hour and 10 minutes and there you go. If nothing else, you killed time watching a steampunk fantasy about a supernatural cowboy and a loyal hooker. I can't think of any movie more deserving of being called a guilty pleasure quite like this one. I certainly couldn't recommend it to anybody without laughing about it, but I enjoyed it enough that on a TV edit, I'd watch it again.5/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Revenge definitely got ugly</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jonah Hex (Josh Brolin) is an ex-confederate who decides he can no longer fight on the wrong side of the civil war and opts for desertion. His actions cause the death of Jeb Turnbull, the son of general Quentin Turnbull (John Malkovich). Out for revenge the general captures Jonah together with his wife and son. The latter are burned alive, while he is crucified and permanently disfigured on the right side of his face with hot iron. Surviving the ordeal only with the help of Indian witchcraft Jonah Hex becomes a bounty hunter, whose all-engulfing life motiff is revenge...Asked whether I enjoyed the movie I would have to say I was kept adequately entertained throughout, even though the multiple flaws were so apparent, that it smelt worse than Jonah's breath. Definitely not the movie that the comic-book fans expected, as for some reason the scriptwriter decides to transform this archetypal Western antihero into a comic-book superhero cross between "John Constantine", "Hellboy" and "The Crow" living in a steam punk world taken from "The Wild Wild West" full with machine-gun Gatlings equipped to a horse and acid-bleeding humanoid pit-fighters. Yes. Exactly.After such a radical departure from the source material it is quite appalling that the movie still calls itself "Jonah Hex". That said Josh Brolin does try his best to convey the murky, sarcastic and dry prototype from the comics. And I really wouldn't mind him as Jonah Hex, as I believe he did an excellent job for what he was offered to play. Nonetheless with the ridiculous plot on offer which does not supply any legroom for serious character development and discussion on the morality of revenge all we have on offering is a mind-numbingly simple popcorn flick, which aims to be even more like a comic-book than the comic-book itself.If you are interested Megan Fox does get to show off some of the Victoria Secret's wild west lingerie and does her best acting performance to date. Almost as if being a prostitute comes more naturally to her than most other roles...A very passable experience and for any fans of the comic a travesty. On it's own the movie is however a decent time filler and several scenes are admittedly beautifully shot and show some undeniable promise. Than again so does the trailer. So maybe best save yourself the time and just watch the 150 second trailer instead?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jonah Hex a disfigured bounty hunter, is hired by the US Government to track down Quentin Turnbull, a former soldier now plotting an attack on the 4th of July. He was also the man who scarred Hex....Oh dear. Potentially this could have been really good. It has Josh Brolin as Hex, and he plays the part perfectly. And there are some excellent performers in the cast, such as John Malkovich, Michael Fassbender, Megan Fox, and others. However, this film has major problems. The storyline is so disjointed, it's sometimes hard to follow. There are scenes that look like they could be very interesting, and are over as soon as they've begun. It looks like the script was made up on the spot, or at the very least, either the producers or studio have hacked a huge chunk of the story out of the finished film. Certainly the film has a short running time, which does suggest major editing of the film, but because this makes the story hard to follow, it actually slows the pace of the film down, making it feel a lot longer.The director Jimmy Heyward does stage a couple of action scenes, that aren't bad, but it's not enough to save the film.I'm not sure how this film would have looked without the obvious cuts and perhaps re-writes, and perhaps when released on DVD there might be an extended version or directors cut of the film. But based on this version this film has to be put down as a major disappointment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The smell from this movie isn't acrid gunsmoke. It's crap.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The people who made this movie apparently thought the only thing wrong with the big screen version of Wild Wild West is that it didn't have any pointless supernatural elements crammed into it. Yeah, I know that sounds incredible. In the long history of bad summer blockbusters, Will Smith's remake of the Robert Conrad TV show stands out as a particularly awful example of filmmakers who just didn't give a crap how much they insulted the audience's intelligence. Yet even though it was one of the most thoroughly panned films of its time, these folks somehow thought it was the almost perfect blueprint for bringing comic book cowboy Jonah Hex to life. The only problem they saw was that they needed to add a little bit of Hellboy to the mix. And not the first one, which was actually good. So this is like Wild Wild West mixed with Hellboy II: The Golden Army. If that's not enough to make you stop reading this review and run screaming into the woods, I don't know what will.I could forgive the occult stuff, even though it's completely unnecessary. While Jonah Hex's subversive, anti-hero adventures were mostly centered in a real world of Western clichés, the character did go through a revival in the comics where he was plunged into a mix of monsters and magic. So, if they'd wanted to make a motion picture about that rendition, it would have been acceptable. The magic in this story, however, is limited to some CGI crows and Jonah having a superpower that isn't even a plot device. It's more like exposition.But when somebody suggested littering the script with 19th century super-science, from side-mounted Gatling guns on Jonah's horse to pistols that shoot sticks of dynamite to a "nation-killer" ultimate weapon that looks like it was created by Rube Goldberg, how did someone else not raise their hand and ask why they were following in the footsteps of a reviled box office disaster? If no one had ever done something like this before, I could understand getting swept up in the novelty of it. Wild Wild West, however, is a giant, unmissable, unmistakable warning against doing exactly what these filmmakers did. It's not like they drove through a red light. It's like these guys saw a "Bridge Out" sign and stepped on the accelerator.And if you're going to try and justify the sci-fi aspects of this flick by pointing to the series where Jonah Hex time traveled into the future, I have only three things to say to you.1. That comic sucked.2. Everybody knows it sucked.3. Shut up.Jonah Hex (Josh Brolin) is a scarred, ex-Confederate bounty hunter called into service by President Grant (Aidan Quinn) to stop an old enemy of Hex from launching a devastating terrorist attack during America's centennial celebrations. With the aid of a tough talking but surprisingly feeble prostitute (Megan Fox), Hex eventually tracks down and confronts his old foe, Quentin Turnbull (John Malkovich). I'm not exactly sure why Hex has two simultaneous battles with Turnbull, one in a fever dream and one in reality, but that's just one of the many, many examples of bad writing on display.Josh Brolin is pretty good and surrounded by a better and less cartoonish movie, this performance might have catapulted him into a whole new level of stardom. Megan Fox also proves she can be more than a hot piece of ass in two terrible Michael Bay films. She's got enough talent to be a hot piece of ass in good movies, though this isn't one of them.Now, my memory may be failing me, but I believe there were stories about some significant reshoots being done on this project. The three deleted scenes on the DVD I watched looked like they belonged to a completely different storyline, so perhaps the immense failings of Jonah Hex are the fault of whoever ordered those reshoots. There's no way the initial production could have been worse than the final, reworked result.Fans of the character can always console ourselves, though, because Clint Eastwood already made a great Jonah Hex movie. If you haven't seen The Outlaw Josey Wales, go watch it. If you've seen it before, you should still watch it about 1,000 more times before bothering with this disaster.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Woeful...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was quite excited when I first heard about this film, the premise looked really great. It's funny how a great looking idea can be turned into something really terrible though. I know I occasionally have to look at a bad film if just to remind me how good the great ones are, but this was truly awful. I will tell you more after this brief summary.Jonah Hex is a survivor of the American Civil War, brutally scarred by Quentin Turnbull, the man who murdered his wife and son as he looked on helpless. After this, Hex was taken in by the Crow Indians who healed him, well almost, he found he could speak to the dead. He left and became a bounty hunter, until the day he gets word from the government that Turnbull is alive. It's now all about revenge for Hex, who is out for blood and nobody is going to stop him. I'll leave it there, there is more but the Spoiler Police will have me fired from a cannon if I say anything else.As I said at the beginning, the premise of this film was quite appealing, the execution, however, was quite appalling. As far as the performances go, well, everyone was professional but the material they had to work with was woeful. So, honourable mentions go to; Josh Brolin as Jonah Hex, John Malkovich, who I can't believe took the part of Quentin Turnbull, Megan Fox, who played, well, Megan Fox as Lilah and finally, Michael Fassbender as Burke. If I was any of these performers I would be having very serious words with my agent.It has the distinction of attaining the lowest score of any film I've watched so far this year (162 at this point in time). The dialogue was turgid and didn't really go anywhere and most of the action happens at night so it's very hard to follow. On the plus side (rare, I know, for this one), I thought the make up effect for Hex's scar was very well done. I do try to watch all films with an open mind, but this was just awful? NOT recommended.My Score: 3.2/10.IMDb Score: 4.6/10 (based on 17,723 votes at the time of going to press).Rotten Tomatoes Score: 12/100 (based on 142 reviews counted at the time of going to press).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Credit IMDbDuring Grant's presidency, Jonah Hex is a remorseless bounty hunter. In the Civil War he was a rebel whose honor put him afoul of a confederate general, Turnbull, who murdered Jonah's family while Jonah watched. As a result of the ordeal, Jonah's face is disfigured and he can talk with the dead. After staging his own death, Turnbull, with a group of rebel stalwarts, hatches a plan to bring the Union to its knees. Grant wants Hex to stop it. While the nation readies to celebrate Independence Day, Hex and an unlikely ally have little time to stop Turnbull and his weapon of mass destruction.What a dud this turned out to be. It had the right cast, the right combination of a revenge action story and a Western, but they just crapped all over it. Megan Fox isn't in the film enough to be considered eye candy.Bottom line. I don't remember much to be honest, there's probably a reason for it. Not recommended, unless you wanna see talents such as Josh Brolin and John Malkovich wasted.3/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jonah Hex could have been much better I agree, but in all honesty I didn't think it was a bad movie. For what it was, if I had to sum it up in one word I'd say decent.My main complaint is Megan Fox. She is absolutely beautiful, and while I am not dismissing her as a bad actress, I did find her rather forced and bland here. Some of the dialogue could have done with more work, some was quite cheesy, and the ending felt abrupt and could have been rounded off better.However, I was impressed if not bowled over by the film's look. I wouldn't say Jonah Hex was visually astounding but it was for me impressive. The cinematography and editing are not completely slip-shod, the effects convince without blowing me away as such, the costumes are above decent and the sets and scenery are meticulously detailed. The soundtrack is fun with some energy and the odd haunting element. There is also an interesting story, an intriguing titular character, okay-ish direction and solid enough pacing. The acting is not going to win any awards, but I wouldn't go to say it was awful, John Malkovich and Josh Brolin fare best.All in all, imperfect but a decent effort. 7/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie really disappointed me, as it begun quite well, with a cheesy, arrogant introduction of Jonah Hex as a grumpy, unstoppable killing machine. But, less than halfway into the movie, it crashes down to something incredibly boring. This is a action movie, and when the action actually becomes lamer as the movie progresses, there's something very wrong. Plus, the funny remarks and quirks, the "cheesyness" from the beginning, stops altogether. Scenes that should be highly memorable, are simply ruined by bad filmmaking. The end, which should be a tremendous climax in the movie, don't feel like a climax at all, and let's just put it like this: A movie with Megan Fox that cannot climax, is a dull, dull movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not even a psychotic Malkovich could save this butchered adaptation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sometimes reviewers can be quite harsh, but let me assure you, we love movies and are willing to give almost anything a chance (sorry Shank). Having said that, after seeing the posters and trailers for Jonah Hex, I found myself saying, "Megan Fox! She's an actress? She's barely a human". Which is fine because Jonah Hex is barely a movie.Set in the old West of 1876, the time of America's centennial, Jonah Hex (Josh Brolin) is a gruff bounty hunter whose scarred visage can be seen on wanted posters everywhere he goes. Hex is out for revenge on the man who not only gave him his scar but killed his wife and child; Quentin Turnbull (John Malkovich), his psychotic commanding officer.After Turnbull's attack on Hex's family, Native Americans find Hex and bring him back from near death, leaving him with the ability to talk to the deceased. Apparently, Hex doesn't think to use this power to talk to his wife or child. Anyhow, when Union army soldiers discover that Turnbull's latest plan is to destroy America with what can only be described as steam-punk weapon of mass destruction, Hex is on his trail with trusty hooker sidekick Lilah (Megan Fox).Though usually reliable, John Malkovich sleepwalks through his role, relying on Michael Fassbender to bring us a decent villain as his evil Irish sidekick Burke. Will Arnett is wasted as a Union soldier and Wes Bentley struggles as a wealthy Southern gentleman being blackmailed by Turnbull (his accent sounds like a cross between Jamaican and Irish). Megan Fox is clearly too young/untalented to play the only stable person in Hex's life and their pointless relationship never has a satisfying payoff. You would think if anyone could play a hooker, it'd be Megan Fox but she even managed to fail at that.I will say this, for all its faults, Jonah Hex does have some top notch stunt work and Hex's Gatling-gun wielding horse is a particular highlight, but sadly it's a one-scene wonder. It really does speak volumes when the highlight of a film is a horse.Although Jimmy Hayward is listed as the director, after the fifth explosion, I was sure this was a Michael Bay production. Every five minutes something goes boom, which is a lot considering that in total this film is just 82 minutes long. At times you almost feel like the film was created purely from the out-takes of Wild Wild West. I half expected a giant mechanical spider to swoop in and crush the life out of a mumbling Josh Brolin.The premise is interesting enough but for some reason, the whole thing's been edited down to the bare essentials leaving it dead behind the eyes. Its tone is wildly uneven and certain scenes wind up being totally irrelevant. Towards the end of the film we're treated to two fights (one real, one imaginary) between Turnbull and Hex that are inter cut and shown at the same time. Why? One's enough for anyone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A deplorable and vomiting experience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My first encounter with Jonah Hex came in the precise moment when I started to find out that the comics could go much further than the typical superheroes which had initially captured my interest in that art.And even though I have never been an obsessive fan of that character, I enjoyed the black humor and bizarre tone from the mini-series Two-Gun Mojo and Riders of the Worm and Such.Because of that, I had the hope that the very negative reviews received by the film Jonah Hex were due to the fact that the people had misunderstood the character, because he had never been really a hero, but a parody of the anti-heroes who are famous in the classic westerns.Needless to say I was wrong...Jonah Hex ended up being an atrocious experience which did not work as an action movie, as a comic adaptation nor as a western.The only thing I did not hate in Jonah Hex is Josh Brolin's solid performance in the leading role; pity that he is caught in such a bad movie.The rest of the actors do whatever they can with their poorly written characters; someone who is authentically wasted is John Malkovich as the boring and lacking of any personality villain.The screenplay from Jonah Hex is nothing more than an incongruent mess of confusing situations, badly written characters and the most rancid clichés from the western genre.Ugh...and did I mention the music from Marco Beltrami and the group Mastodon? That would have been an interesting combination in any other case, but I found it to be absolutely inappropriate to accompany a tedious story about cowboys, American pseudo-History and witchcraft.With the exception of Brolin's performance, I do not find anything positive to say about this movie.Besides of all the previously mentioned defects, the action scenes are very badly filmed and edited, something which is exacerbated by the irregular cinematography.In summary, Jonah Hex is a deplorable and vomiting film which, in my humble opinion, is among the worst films I have seen in 2010.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Simply bad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you take the title of the review as praise, let me say it even more simple: don't watch it! It's below the line where a movie could be good and above the line where it is so bad it's funny; it just sits in the limbo of movies that have no meaning and make no sense.The film is about Jonah Hex, another resurrected comic book hero, this one from the times of the American civil war. The guy almost died once, so he can revive dead people for a short while and talk to them. He doesn't do that with his wife and son, though, only people he killed and with whom he probably has no reason to speak to anyway. Except this special thing of his, he is slow to speak, slow to think, even slow to fight, and he is plain ugly. His only redeeming quality is that Megan Fox is his girlfriend, now that his ugly wife and small child died. He also has a reason to be cool about it, since his life purpose is to kill the man who killed his family. And don't get me started on the weapons made by his black friend Smith who is... a blacksmith. Being so politically correct, he also had native American friends who would cure him when he got his ass kicked too hard. I believe they showed their faces only in blurry semi-consciousness scenes, though.Now, even with a nonsensical plot like this someone could have made something fun, but no: the action was jittering from scene to scene with almost no transition, the acting was bad and without feeling, the director was probably multitasking and John Malkovich... dude! Just quit acting. Let us remember you from the good days when you got decent roles and liked to act.Bottom line (and top, and left and right, borderline like): stay away from this waste of time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Brolin did a good job acting, aside from that this movie was a flop. I feel sorry for the cast for having to add this to their resume. I cant believe that a major company backed this ultimate failure of a movie. The scene where Brolin and Megan Fox are in her room and the soldiers burst in is questionable. The doorway is bright white and its hard to tell if they forgot to put in the background or if its suppose to be some kind of comic book effect. Bottom line it looks bad.The camera angles made me dizzy during the action scenes with bad angles and shaking fast movement. The action scenes are not paced properly and do not get you into the action of the movie. I love action movies and had to turn this one off. If your action scenes suck I usually can stick it out through a movie if the story is interesting, or I need to find out what happens in the end. None of those criteria were met here.The only reason I fast forwarded the movie the rest of the way through was because I held to a sliver of a hope that even though it was a pg-13 rated movie I just might have been able to see some "more revealing" scenes of Megan Fox (so hot). Failure.Watch this movie if you want to see how to turn a great cast and a huge budget into a horrible movie.Sorry but I am just being honest, I even created a profile on this website just to criticize this movie. A waste of my day off and my money! I should have spent my time looking at movie reviews instead of watching this, now I know to check the reviews first.Go back to film school you hack who made this, you are terrible!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A digest version of a feature film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When the film ended and the credits began, I looked in disbelief at the timer. 72 minutes ???? Who makes a live action big budget film that is only 72 minutes long? I haven't seen such a short flick since 1963's DAY OF THE TRIFFIDS.Admittedly the film is not padded. While the filmmakers could have come up with something, anything to give the film some bulk, the scenes that are there all briskly move the action along. The deleted scenes on the DVD would have added nothing to the film aside from a few extra minutes.The film seems a "Western Noir" version of 1999's WILD WILD WEST. The plots are similar-- a special government agent with ties to the Civil War is sent by President Grant to seek out a renegade ex-Confederate officer who now possesses a super-weapon that he'll use to kill Grant and conquer the US. And the hero is aided by a heroine who appears to be a "soiled dove" but whom can handle herself in a fight. At least JONAH HEX does a better job at explaining the title character's background. The main difference the tone of this film. Where WILD WILD WEST was an action comedy, this is a very dark film. Jonah Hex is not a jokester and the few light comments he makes are in character and still very dark. The acting is negligible. Megan Fox continues to show she looks great but can't act her way out of a paper bag. Malkovich is pretty much phoning in his performance as a generic terrorist leader. Fassbinder chews the scenery as his psychopathic Irish assassin. Lance Reddick (from FRINGE) plays a Noble Black Man. But Josh Brolin does a very good job with his title role. He plays Jonah Hex with a weariness and dedication that befits this character. He may seem to be underplaying here but in fact he's struck just the right tone.The geographical sense of the film is pretty bizarre. Folks seem able to ride their horses fairly swiftly between points like the West, New Orleans, and Washington DC. Somewhow the villains are able to transport swiftly and unseen a multi-barreled cannon the size of an M1 Abrams tank. And Washington DC is now apparently on the southern shore of a bay.</fullReview>

This in not the Jonah Hex of the comics, this is kind of a warmed over "Wild, Wild West". Especially the part with the superweapon and President Grant. Well, at least it wasn't a giant spider...Brolin is okay as Hex, John Malkovich is okay as Trumbull, but Megan Fox... ugh. One can only hope this is a career ender for her.

		<shortDescription>Too much cliché for a fictional 'Old West' where everything seems possible</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I hadn't heard anything about how dismally this performed in the box office and I wasn't planning on seeing it either, until I saw it was a western and a superhero movie about a bounty hunter who communicates wtih the dead rolled into one. We've had so few westerns the past 20 years I'll look for them in the most unlikely places, here or The Burrowers. The animated intro of 15 minutes basically tells us "Jonah Hex was this guy and he died and came back and has superpowers and is a badass", an abomination of exposition.Then the movie rides out of the desert into a small dusty frontier town for the best scene in the movie; a set piece of badass gunfighting violence that is a patchwork of spaghetti western references. Jonah Hex says to the town authorities who won't pay him his bounty "you brought 5 coffins, maybe you'll need 8", then he fills them full of lead using two gatling guns like a slicker Django would do. Lovely stuff happens there, tongue in cheek like in the best of spaghettis, a man shoots at him out of a coffin and Jonah shoots him back into the coffin. In the end he picks up the sheriff badge and pins it onto the drooling town idiot. There's a spaghetti western, an Eli Wallach comedy if I'm right, where the protagonist names mayor of town a pig (or a dog) and warns everyone that it better be there when he comes back. It's all very tongue-in-cheek and carried with an air of devilmaycare recklessness.That's all this movie does right.We get the President of the United States saying things like "only Jonah Hex can help us" and John Malkovich making grand 'movie villain' declarations like "on the 4th of July America will burn in flames". There's a secret superweapon involved in that proposed destruction, and personal revenge is the motive behind it and Jonah Hex had something to do with it so he must save the day and get the girl in the end. Megan Fox plays the girl and love interest and only looks sassy and makes cat eyes when she has to.Josh Brolin is looking to see here if he couldn't cash in his snarling persona into a badass antihero type that at different times would have been played by Kurt Russell or Franco Nero or Clint Eastwood, John Malkovich as the Confederate general adds another demented villain to his resume, and Michael Fassbender probably can't hope to live off films like Hunger so he's spending 2010 picking up paychecks for action films like this and Centurion.I wonder if we can't fault a comic book adaptation for being silly and cartoonish. It's not so much that the film doesn't take itself serious, but that it takes itself light in the most cliché/unimaginable way possible. For a fictional 'Old West' universe where everything seems possible, Jonah Hex dully falls in the footprints of the blockbuster action movie - a dozen different locations, contrived backstories, a climax where things blow up. I'm not saying this couldn't have been great, but at least it should have been decent. At barely 70 minutes of movie, this seems like everyone lost interest at some point.It's closer to Van Helsing in that aspect than any Batman movies of the decade. A lot of CGI noise thrown in together with a measure of mystical nonsense about the other world. At some point Josh Brolin spits out a crow. Even Conan had a more dignified "death and rebirth" scene in Conan the Barbarian.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I actually had decent expectations for Jonah Hex. I have never read the comics or really ever heard of the character at all which is surprising given my love of DC Comics. Still the idea of a scarred Phantom like Cowboy, an anti hero with a tinge of the Supernatural seemed unstoppable. At the very least I expected a reasonably entertaining film with a good story. This superhero film is one of the biggest most disappointing duds I've ever seen. Was this a joke? The film clocks in at less than an hour and a half making it more like a spoof comedy or a bad horror flick. Megan Fox who is commonly made fun of and generally considered a disaster as an actress is not the least of the problems in this film. There is little to no development for Jonah Hex, no A-Typical 'where did they come from' story and what they do give you is shortened to the point of barely caring. The special effects are decent but overdone, I'm not sure this story needed a lot of special effects. It made me think they shot this on the same set as the 'Wild Wild West' movie, I just kept waiting for the giant mechanical tarantula. The gunfights which should have been rampant and full of adrenaline were boring and few and far between.Josh Brolin is a great actor and I think he was spot on in his look and performance as Jonah Hex. Its really a sincere shame that the story and concept failed so miserably because there is nothing wrong with his performance. He is brooding and dark and made me think he would be great as a gunslinger in any other film. John Malkovich is a master villain. How could you get a better actor to be a villain? Instead his entire character is a waste to the terrible story. Malkovich is boring and that isn't fair to him because he could have done better. There was no villainy and no chemistry between him and Brolin. Megan Fox is surprisingly used very sparingly. She fits her generic role well enough. I don't despise her quite as much as others do...I mean she oozes sexuality and shows that in this role but the role is very small considering. Her and Brolin actually do have chemistry and she gets some decent one liners. She probably fits better into the substandard story then the others. I won't bother launching into discussing the completely forgettable supporting cast. Its unfortunate but the script and film isn't good enough to give any credit to supporting cast.So the sole reason I managed to squeeze a 5/10 into this disgraceful borefest of a summer flick that lasted a week in most theatres is that Brolin does a decent job, the make up effects were good, some of the special effects were decent and just because the character of Jonah Hex is a cool concept...way to go DC. But the delivery of the film was absolutely disgusting. I would think that early reviewers would have taken one look at this and said...cancel it. So who do you get to direct a solid concept, a well deserved anti hero, a western with a spin...well someone who has had no directing experience and his entire career is based in animation. Simple transition right? Maybe that explains why the film is slapped together, has downright silly moments and the story doesn't fit together at all. Jonah Hex is literally his first live action credit and that just isn't right. Whoever put together the film obviously didn't care whether this lived or died in people's minds. Even if you happen to be a huge Jonah Hex fan you'll be sadly disappointed. Let's all forget this happened and move on. 5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the Fall, 1978 JONAH HEX SPECTACULAR, writer Michael Fleisher and comics great Russ Heath gave us "Jonah Hex WAS... The Last Bounty Hunter!" In this 30-page story, grizzled Civil War vet Hex (who was about as one-note a character as ever appeared in comics) was gunned down while gambling (a la Wild Bill Hickcock); he was then STUFFED and put on display with a traveling show. Apparently unfamiliar with the ancient Egyptian practice of embalming, comics fans debated the scientific verisimilitude of the story. Didn't matter: it was far and away the best Jonah Hex story ever writ- to this day. With the possible exception of Josh Brolin's performance, there's nothing to recommend this movie- nothing. The supernatural element (something that was NEVER a part of the Hex history) was obviously shoe-horned in to provide plenty of opportunity for overblown cgi. (And, oddly enough, is identical to the supernatural element that I used in my copyrighted 2007 short story, "SHADE TREE.") 'Nuff said on that score. Know-it-all filmmakers who undertake bringing comic book characters to the screen (Big or Small; SMALLVILLE, I'm lookin' at YOU) feel a need to **** with- in some cases- 70 years of history. It just doesn't pay, in the long run. (And the upcoming CAPTAIN America looks like another blown opportunity: his costume looks like it was cobbled together from a dumpster. I know whereof I speak on this score: my own Public Access superhero, RATMAN, wore body armor literally made from a plastic trash can and held together with screws.)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all i have been in car crashes that felt visually, emotionally &amp; physically better then this movie.The story line along with, basically, all the acting (no, the guy with the tattoos all over the face was'nt cool) are definitely all up for the razzies this year.This also must be the point in Megan Fox's life when she figures out here place in the movie industry. Porn!! So unconvincing as an actress but so visually stimulant. I mean, that just screams; Porn!! I was in the facepalm stance nearly 1/3 of the movie, one man can just stand so much lameness in under one and half hour. The Nation Killer super weapon (lame name btw) was one of the most unrealistic weapons since the mechanical spider in Wild Wild West.Altogether this movie is as cool as Wild Wild West was funny... and thats damn bad unless you don't have the intelligence and wits of a lamp. Try to avoid this movie, it is bad for your health. Both mentally and physically.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is about a man who saw his family got murdered, and his face got burnt. He sets out to hunt for this bad guy on the request of the government."Jonah Hex" is terrible. I watched over half of the movie and I barely understood the plot, if there was one. The story seems to jump around quickly. The unattractive lead character prevented me from liking the film. Megan Fox's role seems to be there to show skin only. The colour scheme of orange and brown (to make it look Western) bothers me too, as the filmmakers really overdo the colours. They could have at least added more colours to make "Jonah Hex" look visually attractive. I think the filmmakers are too preoccupied with the idea of making a cool Western movie like a comic book movie, but they fail so miserably.</fullReview>

It seems to me her movies are getting progressively worse as the count goes on.Here's a short and simple conclusion: She cannot act even if her life depended on it. She'll probably be better off as a playboy girlfriend or playmate.The story feels so linear and yet there are portions of it I felt were missing a whole chunk. Is it just me? Or have they chopped this one right up, so that it fits into the 100 minute mark? The effects were nothing fantastic. At some point towards the end of the movie, it wasn't even realistic.Could have spend the money making better movies. Definitely not worth the ticket price.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ladies and Gentlemen, the winner of this year's Razzies . . .</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I admit, I knew from the trailers that this movie might be horrible, simply because the dialogue of the 'highlights' was so badly done, I was wondering why the editors that cut the clips for the commercials had even chosen these . . . I had hoped they were saving the better ones for the paying customers. Since I was a fan of the original comic (the Weird Tales and subsequent Jonah Hex DC series before it got into weird plot twists and pointless cross-overs), I was willing to give it a shot. I wasn't convinced that Brolin was the best choice for Hex . . . truth is, I didn't think he just didn't fit the part due to his inability to be as dark as Jonah needed to be. I'm not a die-hard, 'it has to be just like the comic' sort of movie-goer, but I usually expect the directors to try and exceed the original source with their own versions as Raimi did with the first and second Spiderman . . . appease the comic fans, but step it up from the books with a good story, a good cast, and give you a feeling that you just stepped into a modern version of the comic itself. Hayward's version didn't, and Brolin didn't. Part of that was due to a bad casting choice, while the bulk of it was the stupid dialogue, and the hokey direction the film took which even had a 'medal/sheriff's badge presentation from the president' scene that had a line in it that pretty much provided a long overdue laugh.Malkovich was the highlight of the film, but it was clear he had little to work with. As enjoyable as he is to watch, I found myself wincing in sympathy more often than not as he struggled to work with what little he had.Megan Fox . . . well, as pretty as she is, she should stick to playing the parts she's best suited to . . . the attractive person modelling in car commercials rather than acting next to ones that transform into robots. It was bad enough listening to C-movie lines, but to hear them butchered even further with a southern/western accent that she tried to attempt made the experience that much more uncomfortable.All in all, unless you're 12, and/or have low standards for action flicks that usually at least provide SOME clever banter and plot lines that make sense, give it a miss . . . don't even rent the DVD. Even if you're not a fan of the comic, it's just not worth it. If you do happen to be an old-school, die-hard comic fan and you saw this movie, you're likely going to want to open your old box of comics and read them again, trying to wash away the abomination you just experienced.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went into this movie with high expectations for a comic book adaptation, and wow was this a huge slap in the face. What really made this film bad was the terrible pacing and bad writing. The short running time crams everything together so badly, especially in the first 10 minutes, that it's hard to follow the rest of the movie. For instance the Indians. When they save him, they revealed so little, that everything became fuzzy. And then the second time the Indians save him, you would at least expect some back story on them, but no. They could have explained so much in such little time. But I guess that's what you get for having the guys who made Crank and Crank 2 write this movie, and with an extremely short running time, and bad pacing. The cast was good, especially Josh Brolin. Megan Fox was better than I expected, but still typical Megan Fox. As I enjoyed this film for what it was, it was still a huge let down. I'd recommend it if you have nothing better to do.5/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's an easy western to dislike. It is dark and nearly all the action takes place at night. It's a tale of revenge with a touch of Night of the Living Dead. Hex doesn't just see dead people; he seeks them out and extracts information, apparently an old Crow Indian skill.Brolin works hard to keeps this movie together. He must be a good guy as his horse and dog like him. John Malkovich goes through the motions. The only thing worse then Megan Fox is the score. It is loud and screechy and empties the theater over the end credits. After you revenge the murder of your wife, walk off into the sunset with your hooker friend.

		<fullReview>Sometimes practically everything can go wrong with a big-studio feature, and Jonah Hex is one of them. Well, maybe not everything. I'm sure going into the film Josh Brolin thought it was a good idea for his career (or maybe his agent did), by starring in a big Summer tent-pole blockbuster based on a (semi) popular DC comics character. And some of the acting choices (i.e. Michael Fassbender, John Malkovich, Michael Shannon) appear to be inspired. On paper. But brought to the screen like this, in 80 minutes (perhaps 79 minutes too much save for some neat animation early on in the film), it's a mess. Characters aren't developed, the action is shoddy and cut together with ineptness, the story is a limp-noodle of revenge and 1876-set terrorism (?) and the supernatural elements, at best, are silly and, at worst, stupid and lifted from other movies like The Crow and... I dunno, THE CROW?Basically, Jonah Hex is kind of like Josey Wales. That is, if Josey Wales was left out too long in a graveyard and came back with a weird scar on his face (the kind that makes him mumbly, if not quite like Hoffman in Dick Tracy), and can talk to the dead with a touch of the hand. He's also after the man who did him in (then again, apparently, Hex did in Turnbull's family as well, so it's like revenging the revenger, except that the revenger is a total villain set to um bomb the United States with cannons that explode and stuff) and will stop at nothing to do it. That's the whole movie. Megan Fox also shows up as window dressing; she's supposedly the "love" interest, but where's the love? She's supposed to be a sex-pot, but she's only hot here in the kind of slickest way, like a plastic doll. She's supposed to be an actor, but where's the acting? Everything is monotones and stiff, flashing glances or her corset nicely but that's it. That her character is really a plot device goes without saying.Oh, everything is just so... dull though. This could have, at least, been the potential to be the next Ghost Rider - or even the next Ghost Rider (sorry, couldn't think of anything comic-book related as hilariously bad), but only a few times does it reach a level of gleeful campiness. One of those, when Hex is injured and healed by some Indians and gets on a vision-quest for his revenge and (spoiler) a crow comes out of his mouth, is very funny, as is near the end when Hex is offered a position as "Sheriff of America". And yet a lot of the film is content to creak along on a weak script- penned, at least in some part aside from studio meddling from Crank's Neveldine/Taylor- and flat dialog, and, again such weak and tepid action scenes. When one starts pining for the skill and craft in Wild Wild West, there's trouble.I'm sure the actors want to try, and maybe did. That is, who knows what else was filmed before the countless re-shoots from the studio, or what Jimmy Hayward was really able to get out of his actors (his first live- action feature after years of animation). And because of the film's short length, character development or involving action set-pieces are whittled down. I could have gotten more out of a DC-animated movie, where at least there would be some expressive visual flourishes. Whatever charm or excitement or gritty appeal the comic had is washed up and out by Hollywood minutia, acting that goes over the top but not in an enjoyable way (Fassbinder I look at you, and Wes Bentley is just there for some unknown reason), and an open-ending that is weaker than anything else before it. The old west was never this phoned in, or the dead so bored.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Greetings again from the darkness. Had been looking forward to this one because of the unique source material with a twist on the traditional western revenge. Somehow Josh Brolin provided a brooding, yet interesting character despite being surrounded by ridiculous ideas, amateurish directing, a boring story and some atrocious supporting acting. This one simply falls flat.While Brolin deserves the benefit of the doubt ... I am sure his vision was better than director Jimmy Hayward's ... there is no explanation for the "super weapon" or the "love interest". The super weapon is explained as an Eli Whitney invention, while there is just no excuse for Megan Fox and her cardboard performance as the hooker with a heart only for Hex.The other thing that seems pretty basic is that revenge story needs a strong basis for a burning need to get even. Here we get a weak bad guy played by John Malkovich. Malkovich's character kills Hex's family AFTER Hex had killed Malkovich's son. Oh yeah, almost forgot, Jonah Hex can communicate with the dead. Which is good, because there won't be any live people in the audience once word spreads on how lousy this movie is. Such a shame.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was one of my favorites when I was little, way back in the 70s. Even my mom liked Jonah Hex, she was the first one to read it when a new one came out. I never cared for the superhero genre, even when I was a kid. Anyway, I finally saw this film on TV tonight, and the character in the film was completely unlike Jonah Hex. The supernatural element blew chunks, especially that idiotic scene at the grave.W. T. F.John Malkovich gives the worst performance of his career. Megan Fox lives up to her last name, but she'll never win an academy award. This isn't the worst film I've ever seen, but with so much emphasis on spreadsheets and bottom lines and the corporate takeover of Hollywood films, you would expect much, much better. If the guys who backed this film are reading this review, next time throw all your money at the script first, there must be at least one talented screenwriter in the world who could have turned this into gold and kept it consistent with the comic book. Instead, you've produced something that destroys more brain cells than marijuana.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all, I'd like to say that this is another movie that proves that Megan Fox is just a pretty girl that has nothing to do with acting. Jimmy Hayward chose to work on the worst script ever, I can hardly see any new ideas in this movie, I felt as if the director is making some awful mix of themes taken from other successful movies, he even didn't do much effort to add a creative point of view. I advise Jimmy Hayward to invest more time reading scripts before deciding to make a new movie, otherwise he will lose the name he made through cartoon movies. Production and marketing were super successful compared to the content of the movie. I gave the movie a single star though it wasn't very boring because this is not what I expected from Jimmy Hayward, also I am not sure why Jimmy Hayward decided to leave his success in cartoon movies to find failure here!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jonah Hex (2010)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A true cinematic abortion, as it's obvious that Warner Brothers gave up before the film was even released. At first it was promising for DC/WB to put faith into a fairly unknown character. After all, they have taken their sweetassed time in getting the ball rolling for Green Lantern and The Flash. It soon becomes apparent that there is no faith here. Jonah Hex has been torn from the pages of DC, urinated on, used to cover vomit and then relegated to toilet paper duties. Hex is a Western Hellboy, for some reason, able to bring the dead back to life. The plot involves revenge and some heavy handed and painfully moronic hints towards WMD. The film has been cut to crap. It runs at 82 minutes, has an animated prologue, and cuts away before any violence. The rating has hampered the film. Violent deaths, off-screen, Megan Fox as a hooker that only screws off-screen. The pacing is non-stop, which means that characters find people without any explanation. Fassbender is told to find someone Hex loves to punish him. The next scene has Fassbender in Fox's room. People should not be turned away from the character, and film companies should take this bomb as a warning against stupidity. Nobody enjoyed the first Wild WIld West film, this retread is even worse.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hero movies' hall of shame</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many guys want to see some of the quite good superhero movie and many films are very fit as their choices. However, as my opinion, Jonah Hex is not.I think Jonah Hex is one of the superhero movies' "fault". Josh Bolin's character looked too weak. He should have been better than I saw because Hex is "hero". (Maybe it's due to he actually the hero with no supernatural power like Batman) If you saw "Darkman", you could see how Liam Neeson's Darkman showed his furiously revenge against his nemesis. However, Jimmy Hayward (director), Mark Neveldine(screenplay), and Brian Taylor (screenplay) join together to "destroy" Jonah Hex's character. He looked like the "old" man with no power.Most of the film's plot is heavily changed from its original. I think that the crew maybe have to do it because they try not to show Jonah Hex "Begins", but "The Action". For the cast, Michael Fassbander showed himself as one of my opinion's "the most heinous villain". He portrayed Burke as the annoying guy who everyone wish him "go to hell". For John Malkovich, he still the professional main villain with the satisfying termination. Nevertheless, for about Josh Bolin, I am very sad with his performance.Finally, I think Jonah Hex maybe have the fantastic fantasy scene, the OK plot and the great villain, yet it's not the pleasing superhero movies. Hey Viewer! Carefully before you decide to watch Jonah Hex.</fullReview>

After so many successful (and some only middling) interpretations of comic book titles I have to wonder how this got out of the studio.At times I was completely clueless about what was supposed to be happening, maybe because the dialog was almost incomprehensible, but also maybe because the characters came across as unbelievable. I don't think this could be an issue with the actors, as I've watched most of them in Oscar nominated movies.I've not read any other reviews, but to be honest after wasting the time watching it, I don't need to.Watch at your own risk - you have been warned.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just rented this movie a few days ago. I knew very little about the Character or comic of Jonah Hex before I watched this movie, so I had different expectations than if I were watching one of the upcoming movies based on a comic such as Thor, Green Lantern, X-Men First Class, or Captain America. I'm very familiar with their stories so I have high expectations for those films.That being said, this movie had pros and cons: PROS1. Great casting. Who doesn't enjoy John Malkovich as the bad guy? Or at all for that matter? And Josh Brolin gives a commanding performance in any role that he lends his talents to.2. Comic Book Background. This creates enormous potential for the film.3. Superpowers. Jonah has the ability to speak to the dead after they have deceased simply by touching them. and he can also use that ability to destroy them if he chooses too. He's also brought back to life after multiple near-death experiences.CONS 1. Squandering potential. Because this is a movie based on a comic book, it could have been awesome. But it was not. There was a limited amount of action and very little of it was exciting. In my opinion (take it for what its worth), the best action sequence was at the very beginning when Jonah was on his horse and revealed that he had 2 Gatling guns mounted on either side of his horse and he preceded to use them. The "action sequences" after that we're just short and disappointing.2. Length. The entire film, including about 10 minutes of credits at the end, was only about 81 minutes. That's pathetic. Are the filmmakers so apathetic that they just wanted to finish this film as quickly as possible with no regard to story, plot, suspense, or the actors careers? There could have been so much more, (well, at least a good 10-20 minutes, if they had REALLY tried). But so much of the film is spent by Jonah Hex looking for Quentin Turnbull that it becomes a little boring. and there were opportunities for great action, like when Jonah went to that "fight club" and those fighters were in the ring. He was questioning that guy and then 4 or 5 guys were pointing guns at him, which he "magically" escapes from. He could have jumped in the ring to escape and had an epic battle with the crazy guy who was drooling snake venom. Or even right outside the club, there's an extremely brief confrontation with about 3 or 4 men and in the process he sort of rescues that dog. Again, that could have been drawn out.I could go on with many references to events in the film that we're just sort of dismissed, but overall I feel like, for some unknown reason, the filmmakers did EVERYTHING they possibly could to compress the film Apparently, someone told them that Orange County held the record for being the shortest movie ever made and they wanted to break that record. BTW, Orange County is an exponentially better film than Jonah Hex, even though it's a completely different genre.3. Story. As I mentioned earlier, before viewing this film, and even now, I have little to no knowledge of the Jonah Hex comic book storyline so I couldn't tell you how close this did or didn't come to that. Regardless of that, I don't feel that this film did the Character, the comic book, and most importantly, the fans, justice. And on a side note, Megan Fox's character just seemed unnecessary. She really didn't add anything to the film, other than hopes to attract a 13-15 year old target audience. But, if her scenes were cut, the movie would have a TRT of about 67 minutes, which is even more pathetic.In conclusion, my advice is, don't waste your time. If you're looking for a way to spend 81 minutes, use them to watch the first 81 minutes of real movie like Inception, Transformers, Equilibrium, Star Wars, Star Trek(the new one), The Matrix trilogy, The Spider-Man Trilogy, The A-Team, The Island, Limitless, The Dark Knight, Iron Man 1 and 2, Eagle Eye, The Book of Eli, or the Prestige, and then watch the rest of it because you won't be disappointed.For a great film that's around 81 minutes, excluding credits, watch Cellular. It's epic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought this movie was awful. First of all, a supernatural gunslinger, that idea sounds awful to begin with. And then, it isn't even a western. The movie takes place in the south during the Civil War. It seems Hex was left for dead my Turnbull, a man that has chosen to attack civilians, hospitals, etc with his gang. Hex was brought back by Native Americans and this is where the supernatural part comes into play because he can now talk to the dead. And these scenes are not very good. They have the dead person come to "life".Hex has becomes a bounty hunter and believes Turnbull to be dead. However, he is not and is planning to attack the government. So, the President hires Hex to hunt Turnbull down. So Hex eventually finds him through a series of boring events. Then to through in a female presence, Megan Fox plays Hex's favorite prostitute and she kicks a little #ss in the end. And the overall ending is really bad.FINAL VERDICT: Terrible, don't waste your time.</fullReview>

The president wants Hex to stop it.if you go into the movie with a very, very open mind, there is a lot of fun to be had with this this film.Yes, it's heavily edited, but it's mercifully short, and never outstays it's welcome.Yes, Fox is as bad as reported, but to counter balance that, you have a fantastic performance (well, better than anyone else) from Brolin, who does a good job as the titular character.Malkovich is on full ham mode, but isn't really concentrating, and the story isn't very good, but the whole campy value of one of the biggest flops of last year, makes the film worth watching.There are some bizarre scenes that wouldn't look out of place in 'The Fall' and some of the supporting characters are good comedy value.But it is a bad film, just leave your critique and your brains at the door, take a large pinch of salt, and you may find something to like about this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really wanted to like this movie. I grew up with the Jonah Hex comics in my youth and was excited when they announced that they were making a movie out of it.I figured something had gone amiss when in the opening scenes Jonah used his horse mounted Gatling guns to take out some of the baddies. I thought the use of other special weapons made the feel of the movie very gimmicky, like a cowboy James Bond. The real Jonah got by on his mean disposition and a pair of Navy Colts.I also thought it was a mistake to try and include some of the supernatural powers that this Jonah has, like talking to the dead.To make matters worse, the lighting in the movie made it very hard to see a lot of the scenes. I know they were trying to convey a dark and moody atmosphere but it just irritated because I wasn't able to see what was going on.The Special effects were very cheesy, felt very much like Van Helsing. I think the reliance on special effects added nothing to the movie and made it feel like a very cheap production.All in all, a very unsatisfying movie and it could have been so much better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Josh Brolin, who is looking more and more like his father as he grows older, plays the title role in Jonah Hex based on DC Comics hero from the old west. He's one mean and nasty character, but there's a reason Brolin is like that.Back during the Civil War, Brolin betrayed his commanding officer, a Nathan Bedford Forrest like character played by John Malkovich who was going to blow up a hospital. For doing that Malkovich slaughtered Brolin's wife and family, branded him with a nasty scar on his cheek, and left him hanging on his fence. Almost dying he's rescued by Indians and brought back to life. The near death experience has left him with an ability to communicate with the departed. And a nasty disposition which is needed to go into the profession of bounty hunting.No less than the centennial president of the United States, one Ulysses S. Grant summons Brolin saying that this Forrest like character is alive and word has he's planning some really nasty surprise for the American centennial celebrations. Nasty doesn't begin to describe some kind of new weapon he's developed, some kind of gatling gun like cannon that fires rounds of these glowing phosphorescent type balls that can set off terrible explosions. Jonah Hex will not be on the top ten of either of the stars work and the film leaves a lot to be desired except in the way of action. But Brolin and Malkovich seem to be having one great old time in a contest of overacting. They know they have a bad story and they're bluffing their way through the film, looking like they're having a ball.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Never has a film embraced its mediocrity so readily.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Allow me some disclosure here, I am not a box office prognosticator. I know what I like and occasionally I feel strongly that certain films deserve wider acceptance or acclaim - that's it.The movie going audience can be very fickle and hard to predict, who could have thought The Hangover would be massive while dozens of similarly smutty comedies are practically ignored each year. Was American Pie really such a high-water mark in cinema?So I am not going to pretend to know why Jonah Hex tanked so bad. I will offer up some possibilities though:* Josh Brolin is a good lookin' guy, playing a character with half his face missing somewhat dilutes that.* Megan Fox is a good lookin' girl, but for the year prior to the movie's release those photos of her walking around in a corset were everywhere. Perhaps by the time the movie came out most guys thought well we've already seen the best bits, (so to speak).* Pre-publicity ignored what the damn movie was about. It wasn't until I watched it that I knew anything at all. The poster didn't help. All it said was who was in it, not what it was about.* For those that looked a bit harder, perhaps the fact that it was set shortly after the US Civil War lost a few punters, especially once they realize that Mr Hex actually fought for the (pro-slavery) South?* Maybe people are just over comic book films being released that have nothing more going for them than the fact they were based on a comic book?* Or "D - All of the above"?So maybe it was some, most or all of those things. Or perhaps it was something different entirely? I don't know or care. But what I do know is that even if this was a once off anomaly it is a refreshing one - because Jonah Hex is mediocre in every way, and worse than that it seems to embrace and revel in its own mediocrity.Jonah Hex (Josh Brolin) did Quentin Turnbull (John Malkovich) wrong, so Quentin Turnbull thought turn about is fair play and did Jonah Hex wrong - by barbecuing his wife and son and branding his initials on his cheek. Exactly what kind of guy walks around with a convenient brand featuring his own initials isn't covered in the film. Turnbull isn't a rancher - maybe yellow sticky notes weren't invented yet?Hex was nearly killed by Turnbull and left for dead, only to be dragged back from the brink of eternal damnation by an Indian tribe. A side-effect of being near death is that Hex can talk to the dead simply by touching them.So there's that going for him.Hex is understandably is a little perturbed by the death of his family, but as Turnbull was apparently killed he is unable to avenge them. Instead turning into a crack bounty hunter who works alone - for one scene.Megan Fox is a whore... in this film, she plays Hex's love interest. Why she loves Hex is never covered, why he loves her isn't either (why he would like to get some of what she has is clear though!). Fox is merely there to put something purty on the poster, be in need of assistance at the end of the film and sell tickets. Looks like she managed two of those measly goals.The rest of this bizarrely short film continues the by the numbers routine: Identify good guy. Identify bad guy and why they hate each other. Introduce love interest. Have them fight.Turnbull is indeed back and hell bent on doing something big and nasty to the good ole U.S. of A. (cue gasps and boos from the audience). Hex hears of Turnbull's reappearance and heads to his buddy who gives him some "cowboy-James Bond" weapons with which to exact his revenge (the buddy with unique weapons is such an overused device in film nowadays) and save America (cue cheers and mindless "whoops").That's it really. The whole thing is so rote and predictable that at one point I was so ahead of the plot I started seeing the credits in my head even though the film was only half finished!John Malkovich hasn't been seen for a while (in anything decent anyway). The crazy wig and glue-on facial hair he sports as Turnbull makes him look like a huge sheepdog, and he seems to think that this is all one big hammy joke - rightfully so.So...* Malkovich at least can hide behind his ludicrously cartoonish mutton-chops - and rely on his acting chops (mmmm double-chops) to keep a straight face...* Brolin has the advantage of letting CGI do half his work for him, as long as he can keep the left side of his face from frowning or crying he can maintain the illusion of credibility...* Which leaves Megan Fox who must thank her plastic surgeon for enabling her to maintain that odd dead eyed, expressionless look through her 15 minutes or less of screen time... In fact by now she might only be a couple surgeries behind Heidi Montag. Anyway Jonah Hex isn't spectacularly bad, it is more embarrassingly not-good and mercifully ends incredibly early (8 minutes of credits in an already short 80 minute film). And with the budget thrown at it that is why they should be ashamed.Final Rating - 4 / 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jonah Hex, is a hex on movies.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well I made a prediction and I was right. I was right that this blog will be the first Summer Movie that totally blowed and bombed greatly. Here is two major reasons why this movie sucked. First not a lot of people have even heard or seen about Jonah Hex ever. Second, even though Megan Fox is very attractive I sad to say she cannot act. The only decent film she has ever been in was Transformers. After that Megan has only been in roles that made her less popular with critics. All her movie roles are just being a hot women none of them were serious acting roles. All the movies she has been in try to lure teens and 20 year old men to come and see the movie by luring them in with Megan's attractiveness. Now here's just all the quick notes. Bad plot, bad acting, bad choice in actors, and worst idea for a movie. To sum up 1 star out of five stars for this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Jonah Hex" is an American post-Civil War antihero Western film based on the DC Comics character of the same name. It follows the adventure of an U.S. military aka scarred bounty hunter with warrants on his own head and an offer he cannot refuse: in exchange for his freedom, he must stop a terrorist who is ready to unleash Hell on Earth.Cast wise, Average. Josh Brolin is the life line of this movie. His portrayal of the disfigured bounty hunter is convincing and apt. John Malkovich stars as Captain Turnbull, the man who killed Jonah Hex's family and disfigured Jonah ala the film's antagonist. Megan Fox as a gun-wielding prostitute and Jonah Hex's love interest."Jonah Hex" strength lies in its stylized cinematography and awesome guns/weapons. Rest is brutally absurd and pathetic. Megan Fox needs to learn that she can't always run around with a pretty face. She needs some acting classes fast enough. Pivotal aspects like character development, action sequences, dialogue writing, and screenplay are not paid adequate attention. The result is a movie whose short running time is a blessing for viewers, who are spared prolonged absurdity and hapless movie experience.Overall, "Jonah Hex" had the potential for great summer popcorn flick wasted by collective failure. It does have a few decent moments, but overall, "Jonah Hex" is a big letdown.My Verdict: 5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jonah Hex is out of lead</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jonax Hex is the result of either a five cent screenplay or sloppy collaboration between director Jimmy Hayward and his editor. It is stripped to the bone of everything but superhero clichés and gunfire. It is rushed, and artificial, perhaps not dull, but I can't recommend it.Between No Country for Old Men and Milk, Josh Brolin's career was starting to look promising, and then he gets cast in this, where all he has to do is shoot people and grumble. It's impossible to make out a single word he says, in part because of a make up job which covers up one side of his mouth, and looks like it was created using ten bucks worth of Halloween store facial products. The plastic of the story is reflected partially by the writing but also from the general lack of it. There are times in the movie when it becomes annoying how little is shown or said. About three seconds after Megan Fox and Josh Brolin make eye contact they are in bed together. It is made clear that they know each other, but that is about as far as the movie is willing to go. Fox is not even much of a body in the film let alone an actress. At least she could've taken her top off, for all her fans in the audience, but it's pretty evident that the makers are aiming for a PG-13 rating.The only piece of the screenplay which is remotely interesting is Hex's ability to talk to the dead. He spends more time in conversation with corpses than he does with the living members of the cast. This device could've and should've been exploited more.Jonah Hex doesn't have anything to offer. It is an adaptation of a comic book which I don't think anybody has heard of or cares about, and when translated for the screen, it results in an amateurish production, where nobody does their job. It's a poor excuse for a summer blockbuster.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What The Hex</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have read other reviews and those who say just shut your brain down and enjoy the ride are nothing short of silly. It's fine doing that sometimes, but at least those have some sort of a storyline. But when a film is as disjointed as this is, then even that is impossible.It's Style is fine. Josh Brolin is excellent! John Malkovich is as reliable as normal.But there are massive holes in the Plot! For instance, When Malkovic orders his top Hench man to 'bring me back something he loves' to prey on Hex's vulnerability, before you know it he has kidnapped Megan Fox, but where did he get the information that she was the tool Malkovic's character desired? simply a really good guess or he is psychic perhaps? His Second Saving at the hands of Native Red Indians? Why would they help him? Were they the same tribe as before? not explained just taken for granted. A simple rugged old red Indian medicine man standing over his body and saying 'Bring him, we must save him again, his work in this life is not complete yet' would have done, or do the viewers have to make up the plots and fill all the holes themselves? simple laziness or slackness you choose. Also unexplained in any great detail was the whole background to the story itself, the betrayal that Hex's former comrades in arms felt he had brought to them. Briefly touched on, but never really developed. A conflict needs a reason to exist, a reason that needs depth and explanation.I do have the feeling like others this is a highly edited version. it chops and changes to fast, to many holes, the meaning of the coffin in the desert scenes? Watch it for Brolin alone and don't expect too much. It's not terrible, but it ain't great. Oh for a little more time and thought it could have been great!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Should have been better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jonah Hex finally arrives in the UK. As one of the few UK viewers who has actually read some Jonah Hex comics, what did I make of it? Well, it isn't the Jonah Hex of the comics for a start off, but I guess I can understand that. If it wasn't for his eye-catching appearance (which they get absolutely spot on in the movie), Jonah Hex would be your bog standard western bounty hunter with nothing to distinguish him from a host of other bounty hunters, in which case why go to the trouble of using a comic property? Make the film version unique in a different way - in this case by adding twists which turn the movie into a spaghetti western crossed with Ghost Rider crossed with Wild Wild West.John Malkovich's villain provides clear evidence that his career now seeesaws between indie arty character parts and bizarre baddies. Megan Fox's usual feral gorgeousness seems a little swollen and misshapen, as if the botox hadn't quite settled before she went back in front of the cameras. But Josh Brolin's Hex is excellent and belongs in a better film.It's not that there's anything wrong with Jonah Hex. But there's nothing much special about it either.</fullReview>

"Jonah Hex" is not a very good movie.Josh Brolin's performance as the disfigured, vengeance seeking Jonah Hex couldn't save it.Hell, Megan Fox seemed like she wasn't even trying to act.The movie's only 80 minutes long so it has very little time for plot development.In fact, take out the end credits and you get a comic-book based western that's only a mere 73 minutes.That's simply too short of a movie to even be allowed to have been made.Jeez, at least make it 90 minutes.I did somehow find myself to be MILDLY entertained by it.I would be a terrible liar if I said I wasn't bored by it.It wasn't boring, but it's still not a good movie.Don't go to this movie expecting good performances and a top notch story that'll raise Oscar buzz.Go see "Inception" for those 2 things.What you get out of "Jonah Hex" is a sometimes poorly acted and made movie that just doesn't cut it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Josh Brolin is the titled character, a scarred former Confederate soldier who has the power to literally talk to the dead due to his near-death experience and also has wits and weaponry galore which basically make him one of the lesser DC Comics superheroes. His arch-nemesis, played by John Malkovich, is the antagonist here as there is a head-scratching plot to release a hellish weapon upon the United States which was actually built by real historical figure Eli Whitney (taking some time to also develop Civil War weapons after his famous cotton gin). Also along for the ride is rarely seen sex kitten Megan Fox (as a street-smart prostitute) as Brolin's love interest. "Jonah Hex" has an interesting start with a short thumbnail history of its main spotlight player and comic-book style narration. However with that said, the movie runs out of steam quickly with tired routines, witless one-liners, and a dark finale which is more confusing and empty than exciting and awe-inspiring. Malkovich must have lost a bet to appear in this and character actors Aidan Quinn (playing President Ulysses S. Grant) and weak-knee Southern sympathizer/Malkovich financier Wes Bentley (of "American Beauty" fame) hardly make an impression at all. Hot, grueling cinematography (which admittedly has some merits) is not near enough to save this summer dud. 2 stars out of 5 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not nearly as bad it was made out to be</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jonah Hex (Josh Brolin) is a Civil War veteran turned bounty hunter with a link to the afterlife that allows him to speak with the dead. When the safety of the newly reunited United States is threatened by a former Confederate general (John Malkovich) who happens to be the same man who killed Hex's family, President Grant (Aidan Quinn) calls on Hex to stop the attack and exact some revenge for good measure. A lot of stuff blows up.First and foremost, "Jonah Hex" is by no means what I would call a good movie. There are too many plot holes, wasted moments, and editing screw ups to ever confuse this with good. The pitifully short 81 minute run time jumps from place to place with no foundation to hold it together. Screenwriters Neveldine and Taylor (that's what they go by, sadly) reportedly feuded with director Jimmy Hayward and ended up distancing from the finished product before it even hit theaters. And then there's the much maligned Megan Fox who's complete lack of acting ability could single-handedly sink just about any movie. I almost feel bad for Ms. Fox. Because of her extreme level of attractiveness she will never be asked to learn her craft in order to get roles and yet at the same time will always be cast in the same one dimension roles. She's got absolutely nowhere to go in this business and I think "Hex" is the starting point for her rapid decline.With all that said, however, this movie is not nearly as bad as the scathing reviews it received would make it out to be. "Hex" has been painted as the worst movie of the year and may very well win the infamous Razzie Award for Worst Picture at year's end. Maybe it's because my expectations were completely nonexistent going in but I darn near enjoyed about half of this thing. That enjoyment is due in large part to the work of Josh Brolin who seems to bring his A game no matter what's going on around him. This movie reeks of "give up," as if everyone realized midway through production that this thing was headed South in a hurry and mailed in their performances. But not Brolin. He seems hell bent on making Jonah Hex a viable franchise super hero and makes the most out of every limited opportunity his surrounding cast and crew give him to work with. As a result of Brolin's work (with a little help from Michael Fassbender who does an admirable job in his short screen time as a maniacal sidekick-baddie) you get about 35 minutes of a decent-enough comic book movie distributed through and overshadowed by the crap the rest of the film has to offer.Check out my site, the Soap Box Office: www.thesoapboxoffice.blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jonah HexThe American Civil War was not only a tragic time in U.S. history, but it was also a terrible time for men's facial hair.Fortunately, the blistering scar tissue on the face of the ex-Confederate soldier in this comic book-based western makes it impossible for him to grow a proper walrus mustache.Left for dead by his commanding officer Quentin Turnbull (John Malkovich), Jonah Hex (Josh Brolin) returns to the living with the ability to speak with the dead.A bounty hunter by trade, he teams up with a prostitute (Megan Fox) and the U.S. government to stop Turnbull from launching an attack on the Union.With its running time scantly over 60 minutes, this DC Comics adaptation is an ephemeral experience that negates pacing, character development, and purpose.Besides, partnering with a cowboy who can communicate with the dead can be really annoying when you're raiding Indian burial grounds.

Some effects and some shoot out scenes were amusing, but thats it. The film never really takes off like it should. Josh Brolin is uninteresting as Jonah Hex, you're just unsure to root for him, he never really grabs your interest like he did in W(2008), not to mention he and Megan Fox don't have any chemistry. John Malovich is also uninteresting as the main villain, he looks so bored half the time. And the western setting looks so fake. The cast here can do so much better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is a Western with Josh Brolin playing Jonah Hex, a Southerner in the Civil War turned bounty hunter after the war. Megan Fox plays his busy girlfriend &amp; at the end of the movie his only real ally.The plot is set in 1876, the US Centennial Celebration. Turnbull, a Confederate who killed Jonah Hex's family is forming a plot to disrupt the Centennial Celebration using a secret weapon known as a Country killer. Turnbull steals it and prepares to attack Washington, DC on the 100th year Birthday, July 4th.Hex is called upon by President Grant to stop Turnbull. When Hex hears Turnbull is involved, he goes out on his own to try &amp; stop him. It does eventually happen though there are plenty of other fight sequences as there are plenty of enemies of Hex out there, &amp; some men who want to own his girlfriend.The acting here is OK, but the script sometimes gets lost in some confusing fight scenes. The look of the movie is Western, but it fails to pull in the viewer quite enough. I like the touch of HEX being able to wake the dead &amp; talk to them. First time I have seen that since Addams Family Values.</fullReview>

Also probably the worst role Megan Fox has been in so far or at least the most worthless character she ever played, there is no point for her character to be in this until the very end where she plays a slight part in the story. And also to sell the movie with her looks and nothing else. The horse in this played a bigger part than she did. This movie is far from a genuine western film which I wouldn't have mind, but every aspect of this was just so darn boring from start to finish. The plot is ridiculous with this villain played by John Malkovich who tries to use these "Dragon Ball" looking things to blow stuff up. The movie had very few moments that were somewhat decent, but the rest of it plain sucked. I don't even know how this movie made it into theaters, cause the story and everything else was just that bad.

It moves like the wind and has gaps in it bigger than the Grand Canyon.To be certain it never was going to win many awards. the story of the stealing of a super weapon isn't very good, however the film has many small pleasures in the odd intact sequences. I for one love the scene where Hex talks to his enemies son and apologizes for killing him.

		<shortDescription>At least we have a Tom Wopat sighting.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We open up this film with a positive. We are handed a story based on an obscure early-70s comic book that combines the great traditions of the Western with the supernatural forces of the undead. Jonah Hex has been a steady mainstay in the DC/Vertigo comics since the 70s, but is considered almost totally unknown to those outside comic book circles, so every time I mention the movie to people I usually hear, "Jonah who"? Anyway, that is where the fun ends. Being a "retired" comic book fan myself, I too only saw a tiny sliver of the Jonah Hex mythos. I maybe read one issue back in the 70s and what I remember from it was that it was a neat idea, but poorly executed to the point of being silly. I felt, even before I reached my teenage years, that Jonah Hex seemed a little ridiculous. Flash to 2010 and we have a block-buster Hollywood movie starring Josh Brolin, John Malkovich and Megan Fox. Malkovich, the bad guy, has a huge canon that he plans on using on Washington, DC during the 100th anniversary celebration of America. Both Brolin and Malkovich look like they are just claiming a paycheck and Fox is useless in this film. It is a total waste of all three of their talents. We did have a Tom Wopat sighting which was interesting. It wouldn't be a silly western without Luke Duke. Even Will Arnett, who plays a smarmy union officer, is no good in this too. None of the characters are likable. The most interesting and likable characters in the whole film are Hex's two partners ? his dog and his horse. Other than the dog, the horse, looking at Megan Fox and an interesting root-idea for a film, the rest of it contains bad editing, poor construction and god-awful music. There are moments in the film where our director Jimmy Hayward, tries to inter-cut different realities, with the current reality in the film to depict the torment in Hex's soul and to increase the tension of the scene, which turns out to be silly and distracting. Wow, an awful, silly, ridiculous moment in film history. I guess a bad comic book made into a movie would become a bad movie. The only reason I didn't give it an "F", other than a few reasons mentioned earlier, is the fact that Hollywood does have the special effects thing nailed down. Boy I am glad it was only 80 minutes long and even then I couldn't wait to get out of the theater.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You're better off playing "Red Dead Redemption" instead.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before starting this review, I have to say that my only familiarization with the Jonah Hex character was on an episode of BTAS. To my knowledge, this was the best representation of the character yet and they got him down pat in terms of the hideous visage and his sense of justice and raw attitude.So now I view Jonah Hex the movie with a more than cynical approach to the visualization of the film itself. Judging on it's merits alone, the film has some entertaining set pieces and Josh Brolin, does a commendable job as the title character; however despite all this, the film still feels like it was assembled at the last moment by committee. There's no doubt in my mind that it was the hand of the studio that truly robbed what great potential this film could've had(this is evidenced by the PG-13 rating despite Hex's dark upbringing). If there's one thing that's been learned in recent years is that staying true to the core mythos of the character is the best choice for success; just look at the recent Batman, X-Men, Spider-Man films to name a few examples. Though some took a few liberties, for the most part they stayed true to the characters. In the case of Batman, the central values of the character were played out in full force but unfortunately for Jonah Hex, a character whose background was filled with abhorrent ills of human decency, decadence, and sexual lust on the opposite side of the moral spectrum, comes off really short in those aspects.Aside from Brolin's performance, the other players Megan Fox and John Malkovich is so ridiculous in their acting I had trouble letting go. During the course of the film I kept wondering if it's gonna get any worse than this. Well, truth be told I was right. The climax was one of the most blatantly cheesy scenes I have ever witnessed. Without spoiling the plot(or lack thereof) there are ways for a villain to cause chaos on a massive scale. I just didn't buy the whole technological thing that the villain uses in order to achieve his goals. A more realistic approach would be to start a second Civil War against the US government. Had the film taken that approach, the result would feel more authentic and exciting.To say Jonah Hex is a truly bad film would be an understatement. This is hands down one of the worst comic book movies I have ever had the (dis)pleasure of seeing. The only thing noteworthy is Josh Brolin's performance and some action sequences but if you really want to see a better western film, watch A Fistful of Dollars, The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly, Django, and The Big Gundown. I've seen a few films of this genre but these films are MILES ahead of this piece of dogpoo.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jonah Hex (1:42, PG-13) ? Other: Western; 2nd string; crossover; OSIT cynicsI didn't bring my note-taking gear with me to this flik, because it had no overt signs of having anything to do with science fiction or fantasy. I was attending purely for the sake of indulging a guilty pleasure because I (1) like comic books, (2) grew up on Westerns, and (3) enjoy Josh Brolin (terrific lately in Planet Terror, W., and No Country for Old Men). But I wasn't expecting anything special.Imagine my surprise, then, when about a quarter hour into the film we learn that Confederate veteran turned bounty hunter Hex (Brolin) can carry on conversations with the recently deceased. Later it develops that he's preternaturally hard to kill. These unusual skills are chalked up, in flashback, to his having hovered on death's doorstep for days until rescued by sympathetic Crow Indians. (The avian kind of crows also show up periodically in heavy- handed and only vaguely relevant death symbolism.)That near-death experience was at the hands of his former commanding officer, Gen. Quentin Turnbull (an atypically understated performance by John Malkovich), who paused between his crucifixion and torture of Hex by making him watch as his wife and son were burned alive in their simple wooden home. Turnbull sought vengeance because he had ordered Hex and his own son, Jeb (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) to burn a Yankee hospital to the ground, but Hex had refused and ended up shooting his good buddy Jeb, who was determined to carry out his father's orders. We learn this from Jeb himself, a moldered corpse until Hex drags him out of his coffin for a little 'splainin'.Turnbull is played as a soft-spoken but crazed 19th Century equivalent of Osama bin Laden, holding a huge grudge against the United States and determined to strike within it, preferably at some big event hosted by President Ulysses S. Grant (Aidan Quinn). And he's got that century's version of a weapon of mass destruction, too, a giant Gatling-barreled howitzer that shoots big metal balls into his target, with a follow-up shot of a glowing golden snitch (sorry, that's what it looked like) that somehow causes all of the giant bludgers to detonate spectacularly.There's more mystic symbolism scattered thruout the movie, as Hex and Turnbull periodically duke it out mano-a-mano in a red-dirt arroyo decorated only with a black coffin and crow. These scenes have no apparent connection to the ones on either side of them; I guess they're supposed to represent something going on in Jonah's imagination. Maybe. Pretty occult stuff for a Western.And the movie's pretty Eastern for a Western, too. Even tho the opening scenes seem straight out of the great plains or the desert Southwest, much of the action takes place in Georgia (perhaps the source of that red dirt), South Carolina, and Virginia. The characters seem to be able to teleport quickly from one venue to the next.Megan Fox is in the movie, too. She plays Lilah, a saloon hooker with a soft spot for the disfigured Hex and thus his supposedly fatal weakness. At least that's the script's excuse for her, ahem, exposure in this role.For some strange reason, the movie was rated only PG-13, despite copious amounts of murder, torture, bludgeonings, explosions, and cleavage. No spattering blood, tho; I guess that's what passes for kid-friendly in the MPAA's bizarre scale of values.There's a long if not necessarily noble tradition of revenge movies in Hollywood, but the thing that makes you buy into them is that the protagonist was grievously wronged at some point, so we in the audience feel a certain sympathy for him (or, very rarely, her). It was really hard to summon up that attitude toward Jonah Hex, because he's an unmitigated, unrepentant, unhesitating a-hole. It's a regrettably one-note performance from the talented Brolin, but undoubtedly what the director demanded of him.Still, Warner Brothers gets points for daring to do a Western decades after John Wayne and Gary Cooper rode off into their final sunsets, and director Jimmy Hayward deserves a certain amount of credit for restraint by not overdoing the plot's relatively original supernatural gimmick. It could easily have been so much worse. I'm trying hard to figure, tho, how it could have been a whole lot better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Josh Brolin stars as the title character in Jonah Hex, which is based on the DC comic book series of the same name. While I have seen the comic books in stores over the years, I have never read them. I am not able to say how close the movie adheres to DC Universe. Regardless, I found the movie to be sufficiently enjoyable. Johan Hex is a former Confederate officer turned bounty hunter who is called upon by President Grant to help stop arch-enemy Quentin Turnbull (played by John Malkovich) from building a super weapon. Through voice-overs, and a uniquely styled cartoon segment, we find out how Hex received his distinctive facial scarring and why he is a bounty hunter. Stylistically, the film excels. The costumes and scenes are fitting and believable. The non-descript heavy metal music score was unexpected, but worked well in the action and fighting sequences. While over-the-top fighting sequences are expected in comic book film adaptations, Jonah Hex generally keeps them grounded and slightly less unbelievable. The special effects are consistent and realistic throughout the film. I especially liked the scene when the crow flies out of Hex's mouth during the healing ceremony. The plot was swift but jumpy. A lot could have been saved if Lilah (Megan Fox) was completely removed from this storyline. Fox seems to server mostly as eye candy, as she does not offer much to the story that Hex couldn't have just voiced-over anyway. Also, in such a dirty world, she is just too clean to be believable. A late-1860s prostitute with perfectly white teeth and red lipstick?John Malkovich gives his typical straight-line performance of a psycho in command, a la Cyrus the Virus in Con Air. Were it not for the long hair I would have mistaken Turnbull for Cyrus, as they deliver uninspired lines in the same deadpan manner. Josh Brolin plays Hex rather stiffly. The most convincing acting he gives in the whole movie is when he looks at the dog and tells him he doesn't know what to say to him. I realize that comic book anti-heroes are typically brooding and edgy, but Hex's monotone, gruff voice wears thin quickly. Fortunately, the film is just over an hour long without the credits. The bright spot in the acting was Michael Fassbender as Burke, Turnbull's right-hand man. He showed some believable emotion and life in his character. As with most comic book turned film movies I can only guess that we will see a sequel or two. I like the Hex character overall and would like to see more of him. The nice thing about a sequel is that no time need be wasted on setting up the character history. If Brolin can pull together a less stoic performance as Hex a sequel may be more enjoyable than this film was.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Musix, some effects, some shoot out scenes were fine and powerful, but thats it...nothing more. the script sometimes gets lost in some confusing fight scenes. Jonah hex's persona was so irresistible and hard that could kill 8 men in just a blink of eyes, But when he faces the wretched "Burke" become weak. Why? Maybe the persona of "Burke" had no attendance of righter and director!! Quietb-1 commented well on this movie: "A western with a twist or a twisted western?, " thx dude Jimmy Hayward, maybe great on animations like "Horton Hears a Who! (Directing-LOVE IT!)" or "Finding Nemo (animator)" or "Toy Story 1&amp;2 (animator)" but not good in real movies yet.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>waste of a potential good story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just watched this film and wish i hadn't.... when a writer creates a new story or screenplay they often write a start, they then write key stages throughout the story followed by an ending. When all this is in place they complete all the details in between. It seems with this film someone forgot to write all the details in between!!The film seemed to be one action sequence followed by another with some childish directing / editing in between just to split up the action scenes.....I hear action fans say oh well at least it will be entertaining with all the action.... sorry the actions pretty poor as well.Its always good to see Megan fox in skimpy clothing but her role was kind of like parsley on a steak - just for garnish. So much more could have been made of her character.Josh brolin must be annoyed with himself for allowing the film company / director to make such a lemon of a film with him in it! Indeed there were several good quality actors in this "production" but no one was allowed to shine or develop any characters at all....Such a shame this could have been a quirky, interesting, fun film but Hollywood decided to make utter rubbish instead. I wonder why they allow themselves to make mistakes like this so often. Is there truly no imagination left in Hollywood?PS nice corset Megan. You look great even in a waste of a movie like this!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shoot 'em up?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I await this movie with deep trepidation. The very idea as presented is wrong. The original Jonah Hex, of Weird Western Tales of the early-mid 1970s, were easily the equal of any contemporary Clint Eastwood film; easily. Often, the stories were rougher and more realistic in content than the Spaghetti Westerns themselves. Many of the original stories were written by writers in the DC stable who, given a free hand in a 'low-level' comic book, had unusual freedom to do whatever they wanted; the stories were masterfully illustrated by a succession of unusually talented Filipino artists.The 'origin' of Jonah Hex as described here is actually the second: the original cause of Hex's facial disfigurement is gunfire in the closing days of the US Civil War. The real subtext of the character is that of a terribly damaged war veteran, unable to find a home or place, and choosing to use his skills in the periphery of society.Much, much later, the character was hijacked and contorted into a fantasy/horror figure, in TWO-GUN MOJO and the ludicrous transposition to sci-fi in the last issues of the titled JONAH HEX comic book.Those of us who remember discovering Westerns that gave Clint Eastwood an easy run for his money, and an anti-hero who would have eaten The Man With No Name for chowtime, this movie with the otherwise excellent Josh Brolin and the poppy/body-of-the-moment (although showing real potential in JENNIFER'S BODY) Megan Fox... well, if the movie lives down to its trailer, it is a travesty of a very well developed but sadly little-known Western character, well deserving of reknown.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'll start off by saying first and foremost, I have no experience with the comic books, the character history or anything like that.I wasn't expecting Oscar worthy anything from this movie and I certainly didn't get it. As far as the actors go I did enjoy the performances of both Josh Brolin and John Malkovich. Both did what they could with what they had. The less said about Megan Fox the better.The script is rushed to put it mildly, the movie could have done with boosting the run time up to 2 hrs and rewrite or two to flesh out the story.As it stands it is a popcorn flick and I was kept entertained for the most part so I can't really complain.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jonah Hex will not win any Oscars. But the movie is a solid action film Jonah Hex in the comics had a complex history that spans 40 years and since the film has a short running time of only 80 minutes the film makers decided to give Hex they're own spin and shake things up. Guess what it works. The movie Hex has the ability to talk to the dead something he cannot do in the comics. But it adds to the film it gives Hex a added dimension having witnessed his family die and being scarred and left for dead by Confederete general Quenton Turnbull a man who blames Hex for the death of his son who died trying to get Hex to obey orders to kill innocents. Turnbull is crazy and after killing the Hex Family Jonah is left hanging between the living and the dead and comes back with the power to talk to the dead. Jonah then becomes a hard cased bounty hunter who makes enemies everywhere he has a price on his head until President Grant decides he needs Jonah Hex to find Turnbull and stop him from unleashing a terrible weapon of mass destruction. Megan Fox is not a world class talent but she shines here as the hooker with a heart of gold who is in love with Hex. It's a thankless role but Fox does justice to it she does a credible job in it and is actually a joy to watch. Josh Brolin however deserves all the credit he brings Hex to life Josh Brolin is actually one of the main reasons to see this movie he delivers. I for one would love to see Jonah Hex ride on the silver screen again in another story of his adventures. Shut your brain off and don't take it so seriously and you'll have a great time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK 1. I have never read a Jonah Hex comic in my life though I do have some.2. This is what Ghost Rider should have been.I just finished watching and wanted to go again and again and again.. I don't see what all the complaints are about. I can't compare it to the comics because I have never read one. I will say that it was as promised a cross between Hellboy and Spagetti westerns meets Wild Wild West because of the high tech gadgets that were not really in that time.. but .. gee whiz people don't really re animate the dead and talk to them either but then again this is a comic adaptation not reality. So with that in mind I went in to enjoy a movie and did so. Sure there was a little lacking in character development which if they had done more of that there would not have been time for the story.What did I like about the movie? There was a plot clearly defined, You knew what the movie was about you did not have to guess. I walked into this movie and did not have to know anything about Jonah Hex to enjoy it. There were not many in there and it was opening to a small room which surprised me for the opening day of a movie. I think it's gotten a lot of bad press and phony bad reviews. I saw nothing wrong with the acting of any characters in this film. There was action, romance, adventure, and laughs.I can't say that if your a Johnah Hex fan that you will like the movie because again I know nothing about the comic.. but if you have never read it and want a good movie that rocks.. go see it and give it a chance :) it is really good. Just keep in mind it's "FICTION" not reality and not a history piece.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hell hath no fury like Jonah Hex. Jonah Hex loses his family to John Malkovich's Confederate general Quentin Turnbull for killing his brother in an act of defiance against the order of attacking a hospital of innocents. Hex watches as his home is burnt to the ground with his wife and son in it, with Turnbull branding his face for extra remembrance. When he hears that Turnbull died supposedly in a hotel fire, Hex takes up bounty hunting, soon becoming a wanted man after defending himself against a crooked sheriff and his posse over money owed him for bringing in escaped felons. Turnbull plans to wipe Washington off the map with a mega weapon thought to have been designed by none other than Eli Whitney(cotton gin). Hex will be commissioned by Ulysses S Grant(Aidan Quinn) himself to hunt down and stop Turnbull before his plans are carried out on Independence Day. Josh Brolin gets the "laconic, raspy-voiced, determined" gunfighter role, thick southern drawl an all, in this Old West shoot 'em up set during the Civil War era in the United States. Malkovich slides comfortably into the cold-blooded psychopath role, a hissable villain willing to destroy towns of innocent people to prove a point regarding what he's perfectly capable of. Jonah Hex is a heroic Confederate(unusual in a mainstream Hollywood film)whose reasons for joining the army were because he didn't "like taking orders from anyone". Amusing how often as he exits towns, buildings are exploding or going down in flames. Megan Fox, surprising enough, isn't in the movie that much, given a chance at the end to help Hex shoot/punch his way through a ship of soldiers containing the weapon meant to annihilate Washington DC. As Lilah, she doesn't really even have much of a chance to titillate us, though in those tight corsets, her boobs barely stay where they belong..that, and slits up her dress reveal her sexy legs at times, but not enough to get the boys all hot and bothered. Hex gets to use weapons which "blow sht up" such as cannons on each side of his horse which use multiple rounds of ammunition, and two hand pistols(with arrows that open when he pulls the trigger) which shoot dynamite sticks that detonate immediately what they impact(normally people). This is every bit the PG 13 comic book action western, with no bloodshed. Hex, having almost died, is able to speak to the dead and uses associates of Turnbull to get directions(!)to his whereabouts. Fox portrays a prostitute who is in love with Hex, wanting a commitment from him. She, of course, will be used as leverage to trap Hex. Not very long, it's over and done before you know it. Forgettable summer timewaster, nothing more or less. Michael Fassbender steals his scenes as a sadistic associate of Turnbull, one of the chief men responsible for killing Hex's family.</fullReview>
