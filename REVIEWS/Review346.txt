		<fullReview>Wayne and Ford at their peak.Somehow I missed this film until a few years ago on a cable movie channel. Growing up with WWII as the dominant theme of modern history and an appreciation of the older film stars, this film is without question the most realistic in terms of the message and of just passed events with superb performances in the old morality style of the 40's.The old Navy, surviving in the Asiatic backwater where promotions could take years, bears the brunt of the onslaught of total war for America. A heroic tragedy of holding the line to bide time for the Nation to recover.A story for all time, the greatest war movie of all time. No matter how large the budget and digital special effects, they will never capture the texture and feel of this film. The dying of the old Navy from Yangtze to Cavite with gutsy sailors like "Boats" living hard in the backwater paradise of the Pacific on $20 a month.The tragedy of continuing defeat, overwhelming catastrophic events, the ill prepared Nation, the dying of the old Navy, all combine to make this film, made with event still fresh in the actors and film makers minds, a statement of that war and of the heroes which the audience knew first hand. It says, we knew these men and boys and they were as fine a heroes this country has ever produced and they will live larger than life for as long as this film exists.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Geography Made Them Expendable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>They Were Expendable is John Ford's first Hollywood feature since his discharge from the U.S. Navy and the same can be said for Robert Montgomery. Both had served in the Navy and Montgomery in fact on P.T. Boats. From the last presidential election we now know them as Swift Boats. It's an unusual John Ford film because the usual heavy comedic monkeyshines are rather subdued here. I'm thinking that John Ford wisely decided that World War II being recently over, the country's mood was joyous, but somber in terms of the heavy human cost.They Were Expendable has the benefit though of the American audience knowing the ultimate victory. The story begins in the Phillipines in 1941 with Robert Montgomery as real life naval hero John Bulkeley, renamed Brickley for the film, trying to convince the brass of the usefulness of the P.T. Boat in combat, not just for scouting and courier duty. Of course that experiment is cut short and the P.T. Boats and their crews are rushed into some on the job experience.During the film MacArthur, you might recall Gregory Peck saying that he was going to be evacuated from Corregidor by "one of Johnny Bulkeley's torpedo boats." That scene is dramatized as a wordless Robert Barrat plays MacArthur traveling on the boat commanded by John Wayne.Wayne is Montgomery's second in command of the P.T. boat squadron who is not thrilled to be there. He'd like to be on at least a destroyer. He gradually comes around though. He also gets a fling in the romance department with Navy nurse Donna Reed.During that interlude John Ford had some of the crew outside singing Dear Old Girl in a comic vein. Ford was never one to not let a good bit of business die with one film. You might remember in Fort Apache and Rio Grande there was some serenading done. And Donna Reed got serenaded on her "Hawaiian" honeymoon with James Stewart in It's a Wonderful Life with Ward Bond once again being one of the serenaders. I'm sure Frank Capra would have conceded he stole that from Ford.The story is first and foremost about some very desperate American armed forces who after Pearl Harbor were at the Japanese mercy. Pearl Harbor had totalled our Pacific fleet and no supplies could get through. Still the troops there fought on bravely, they were in fact by geography expendable. Wayne and Montgomery give good but subdued performances. No do or die heroics here, just a sobering reminder of a terrible beginning for the Americans in the Pacific theater of World War II.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Greatest War Films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have very strong feelings about this film. As a baby boomer, I have always felt that mine and future generations owe an eternal debt to those who didn't come back.One way of acknowledging this debt is the way we watch war films, not as bloody spectacles but as tributes and reminders.And what kind of tribute and reminder is "They Were Expendable"? Consider the rueful irony of the title. Such a sentiment is quite uncharacteristic of director John Ford's other work, especially his westerns (possibly excepting "Fort Apache"), which border on jingoism. Yes, there's a scene that's pretty hard to take: When the boats are detailed to take MacArthur out of harm's way, Ford tries to make out like they're rescuing Lincoln, complete with "Battle Hymn of the Republic" soundtrack. Today we know MacArthur as an overrated blow-hard, but 1945 was too early to see past the hype. And yes, there's some of the usual Ford corn-ball and the familiar Ford players, with John Wayne and Ward Bond doing their thing. But then, there's the great Robert Montgomery, who did active duty (unlike Wayne), and I truly believe he was playing this film, both as actor and co-director, straight from the heart. You can see it in a scene in which he realizes his duty means his death. Much of that scene is shot in shadow, but paradoxically the darkness serves to enhance Montgomery's underplayed emotions. The emotions are similar when Montgomery and Wayne are later confronted with an order that saves their lives but dooms their men.Implicit in the belief that war is sometimes necessary is the inevitability of some of the most excruciating moral dilemmas imaginable. And when I see these dilemmas imposed on men and women, boys and girls, demanding their lives in payment for their sacred honor, I'm humbled beyond words.Life magazine used to do huge layouts of kids killed in World War II combat. When I look at these faces and think of the words "They Were Expendable," I . . .</fullReview>

The acting is first rate every part is played with a great belief,,there are so many great scenes that touch the heart.The men are bonded together by their actions and when the bonds are broken through death or orders it hurts us all. Donna Reed is gorgeous to look at ,only a small role but well acted. At the end of the film you feel a lump in your throat and a tear forms in your eye,I love this movie.9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Authenticity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The best war films pull no punches. They also make the point that -- irrespective of natural sentiment and political bias -- war is by nature an aberration, lacking any rational basis for justifying its recurrence through the centuries. War is essentially uncivilized, and can be excused only when a disputant being attacked can define a clear and present danger against which no alternative obtains.Lesser war films tend to extol the virtues of war, glamorize heroism in battle, play on the viewer's emotions, blow things up for the sake of thrills, exaggerate false sentiment, betray a jingoist point of view, and most reprehensible of all cloak themselves in Orwellian speeches that seek to manipulate an unwitting audience into action.This film is simply one of the best of the best. Except for one or two sequences it relies on believable, non-heroic characters involved in acts of concentrated heroism under the most stressful and suspenseful conditions imaginable. Its tone is that of having been filmed in actual wartime using many actors who themselves were recent combatants. Yet it covers a full range of cinematic possibilities, from a sensitive script to an excellent musical score.I will not dwell on all the aspects of authentic, almost documentary, elements in this film. I spent the war on the home front, and thus do not know of all the technically correct parts that others here have commented on. My own recollection was that most of the ordinary joes were always referring to Douglas MacArthur as "Dugout Doug," a derogatory swipe at his flight to Australia and reluctance to go on the offensive for some time thereafter.Like other great war films such as All Quiet on the Western Front and Paths of Glory, this one takes its place right up there.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>perhaps the best of the American war flicks made during the war</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is so exceptionally well-written, acted and directed. Although I am a big fan of some of John Wayne's other war pictures such as The Flying Tigers and The Fighting Sea Bees, these films are not exactly realistic and make it look like Wayne and his friends could have almost single-handedly beaten the Japanese! But, with They Were Expendible, the over-the-top heroism and exploits are instead replaced with grim determination against the odds and a quiet dignity. Because of that, to me, the impact of this film was much more lasting and heart-felt. Realism is key to this picture.Oh, and by the way, Robert Montgomery gets top billing because when the film was made he was the bigger star--Wayne's rise to the top in Hollywood was still to come. I really see this more as Wayne's film as his part seemed BIGGER and he seemed to get at least as much screen time as Montgomery.This would be an excellent film for teens, as it focuses on glory and heroism without glorifying death or trivializing our sacrifices.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Very few, if any, WW2 films are better than this. I first saw it several years ago on a wet miserable Saturday afternoon in winter and subsequently taped it at the next showing. I have seen it several times since then.Despite not living through this difficult time I can imagine it capturing how the US forces felt in the early days of the Pacific war. As the film states, these are the men who laid down the initial sacrifice that others built on. They were no doubt aware of this, and that escape before the Japanese arrived was their only real chance of survival.John Ford created a basically solemn film in keeping with the times. Action is pretty minimal but this does not detract from the film at all. Solid performances from all the caste and one of John Wayne's best performances. Some of the action sequences could have been better (but it was made over 50 years ago), a bit too much of men jumping on and off MTB's, and the dinner scene between Wayne and Donna Reed did nothing for me. A downbeat ending with some crew going off to help plan for later battles and others marching off to almost certain death, but it is in keeping with what the US forces faced at the time.Recent good WW2 films such as Saving Private Ryan and Thin Red Line show what can be achieved now with a big budget and huge technical advances, but it doesn't make them any better than this film.I only hope it comes out in DVD in the UK. 9 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Probably the greatest WWII film of its era.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rather than re-hash Tom Martin's excellent review of the film, I would rather provide some personal reflections.This really is the most human of all the late-era WWII films, minus much of the blatantly propagandistic speeches that mar so many movies from that era. Rather, the dialogue is beautifully understated. Robert Montgomery's "looking for the Arizona too" comment to Wayne sums up the feelings of its time much more than a five minute speech on how important it is to win the war could ever do.The cinematography is top notch, as it is in most of Ford's films. Watching this I believe we can definately see how Orson Welles would be influenced by his work over the years.Robert Montgomery's work here is fantastic; again, as Martin states in his review, probably his best work in front of the camera. He seems war-weary (and in one of the Duke's biographies this is probably how Montgomery really was at this time, as he had seen quite a bit of action during the war before the film was made). John Wayne's character provides us with proof that he truly was a great actor. Watch the scene where he sits in a bar listening to a broadcast from San Francisco about the fall of Coregidor; his emotions are completely shown by the camera; no "let's get them dirty so-and-so's" speeches here, this is pure, wordless acting.All in all, a great film; the best of the WWII era, and certainly one of the best of the 1940's. No hesitations here on my score: 10* out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of my earliest recollections of late night TV as a child was of boats speeding across the water with guns blazing and explosions going off all around them. I was mesmerized by how real everything looked even though it was in black and white. For reasons I didn't understand at the time, I saw those scenes several times as a small child. Obviously, my father enjoyed the movie! Didn't know who was in the movie, just knew I liked the big tall guy with the baseball cap. LOL Years later my father spoke of the movie as one of his favorites, and one Saturday night while up late working on model airplanes or ships, They Were Expendable came on and I realized that the guy in the baseball cap was my favorite actor John Wayne. A movie without all the patriotic jingoism of the day, just real people fighting a losing battle and, like Douglas MacArthur, hoping to "return" one day to fight again. Decades later a friend gave me a 2nd or 3rd edition hardbound copy of the book the movie was based on, a story of real people and real events, and I found that John Ford did the book proud. As I've gotten older and wiser, this movie has gotten better and better, with those special effects explosions still amazing me after all these years.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>POSSIBLE SPOILERS (especially if you who never heard of Bataan) I am an offspring of the WWII Generation. I have one uncle, a POW, buried in the Philipines. After December 7, 1941 he was left behind along with 69,999 other American and Philipino troops. My folks never let me forget and Memorial Day was his day, Uncle Austin."They Were Expendable" unlike the movies "Bataan" and "Wake Island" is more than a flag waving piece of propaganda. John Ford (Admiral USN, Deceased)invested a lot of emotion into this story. Clearly, he felt something real and powerful for the men and women left behind to face certain death at the hands of a barbarous and cruel enemy. The reverential pacing of the film, the closeups of the faces of these men, their quiet and heroic reaction to their doom, all of this is very moving. The last airplane boarding scene is a real tear jerker. I draw real comfort from the character of Brigadier General Martin (Jack Holt) left behind to fight on to the end. I like to think that my Uncle Austin was there with him, M1917 Enfield in hand.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Memorable, slow-paced World War II film with fine performances from Robert Montgomery, John Wayne and Donna Reed with excellent direction by John Ford.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a memorable war film. Unlike other war films which depict glamorous battles, brutal campaigns and heroic exploits, this film focuses on average sailors who are merely doing a job. This often touching story is sandwiched around the real life escape of General and Mrs. McArthur from Corregidor at the beginning of World War II. The film does a good job portraying the collapse of American and Fillipino resistance in late 1941 and early 1942. The war is going badly, and this film does not try to sugar coat it. General Martin's character (played by Jack Holt) articulates this well at the end of the film. "The end is near here", he says.John Wayne plays Rusty, a somewhat disgruntled officer who is unhappy about serving on a patrol torpedo (PT) boat. "Plywood dreams", he calls them in one scene. The fortunes of war intervene and Rusty and his comrades must fight the invading Japanese. Wayne's performance is memorable here, because it is uncharacteristic of his work. Wayne is not the macho heroic fighter that we see in most of his other war films. Here he is a professional sailor doing his job the best he knows how. At the end he predictably tries to be a hero, but star Robert Montgomery polites reminds him that there are other priorities. "Who are you fighting for", he asks. Wayne's character has depth. Uncharacteristically for Wayne he is even a little unsure of himself at times. This is particularly evident in his relationship with the young nurse played by Donna Reed. This is a different Wayne.Robert Montgomery's performance as the commander of the squadron is also first rate. Like Wayne he is a professional who wants to do his job. The burden of command falls on him as he begs, cajoles and even blackmails fellow sailors to put his PT's in the war. Montgomery's performance is understated, credible and moving. It may be his best work.This film is a collection of images. The destruction at Subic Bay in a Japanese air strike comes the closest to graphic violence of any scene in the movie. Instead of bodies, we see fires, smoke, debris and the faces of dazed servicemen and civilians. In another scene Wayne and Montgomery stand on a long dock stretching out into an empty inlet. "Are you looking for the Arizona, too," Rusty asks. The scenes depicting the escape of the McArthur's are well staged and realistic. The scenes of the defeated American army retreating on Mindanao show graphically that the war is not going well. The last image in the film with the last American plane to leave the Phillipines flying over a tropical beach at sunset is one of the most memorable in any war film. The words "I shall return" which appear on the screen are trite and unnecessary. Director John Ford has created a collage of memorable images here.This film is slow paced for a war film, but it works. There is sufficient action, but there are interludes of peace and tranquility. There is a candlelight dinner for Rusty and his girl. There are a few moments near the end in a bar. In another scene Wayne visits with an elderly shipwright. The journey with the McArthurs provides another appropriate interlude in the middle of the film. There are even light moments interspersed. In one of these Marshal Thompson is inspecting the galley and asks derisively "What kind of soup is this?" When told it's not soup but dishwater he goes quickly to his next stop.This is a simple story of fighting men doing a job that isn't considered particularly important. John Ford's excellent direction turns these mundane moments into one of the most memorable war films ever. Star Robert Montgomery even had a chance to direct in this film when Ford was injured in a fall. I liked this film and would recommend it without reservations.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Overlong, but honest WW II classic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"They Were Expendable" may not be as famous as some other WW II sagas, but it is for the most part, an honest attempt to examine the relationships of a crew as they go thru the experience of facing losses during the war. It is to their credit that vets Ford, Montgomery, et. al. decided to depict a part of the war where it was difficult to remain positive, where you were forced to leave members of your crew behind to face the uncertainties of meeting up with the enemy.Yes, there are times when Ford lays it on a little thick, and his use of "Anchors Aweigh", "Halls of Montezuma" and "Battle Hymn of the Republic" are a little too much, but these are minor flaws. In the end you have an honest examination of the war, as told by the men who actually fought in the war (if I'm not mistaken, Montgomery actually was assigned to PT boat duty during the war).The performances are all first rate. Robert Montgomery, who admittedly has never been one of my favorite actors, does a wonderful job as Brickley, the leader trying to find a way for his crew to make an impact on the war. John Wayne is marvelous as "Rusty" Ryan, second to Brickley, and leave his own mark on the war.Most everything about this picture is terrific. The only problem I had with this movie was what another user commented on it. It's really two movies in one. I found the more personal side of the war, the part dealing with the hospital and relationship between Wayne and Montgomery more rewarding than the action sequences (which were all first-rate). I wanted to see more of this, because I felt that with Ford at the helm, this would be more unusual for him to explore, and therefore more interesting. I therefore felt that the movie, overall, was too long in telling it's story.In the end you have a very satisfying, refreshingly honest account of an unpleasant period during WW II.7 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There's little left to be said about this first rate film, so beautifully underplayed and artistically photographed. I saw it first when I was very young (a child, actually) and was unimpressed, preferring the super-heroics of explosive war films when the enemy is flattened and obliterated. As an adult, I find it unequaled for moments of truth and legitimate pathos, particularly the scene where John Wayne, standing at the coffin, recites Stevenson's "Hunter Home from the Hill," then slouches into the saloon where he is joined by his men. In the background just when the report of Bataan's being overrun is broadcast, the radio resumes playing "Marqueta."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An underrated WWII Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"They Were Expendable" could also be termed "They Were Underrated." Of all the films made during and immediately after World War II, this one ranks as one of the greatest, and least mentioned. Perhaps because it deals with defeat rather than victory; loss rather than gain; John Wayne failing, rather than succeeding. This film deals with emotions rather than with flat-out action and battle scenes. The theme, so well put out by Ford and his cast, is that this is the lot of the professional military man: when war breaks out, they fight, die, and hold the line until the country fully mobilizes its forces against the enemy. The entire cast conveys, at the same time, a naive optimism and a stoic resignation to their fate. They continue to fight, knowing that reinforcements are not coming, and that their destiny will either be death or captivity at the hands of the Japanese. Watching this film one feels the despair, the heat, the dust, the almost hopelessness of their actions. The question becomes "What kind of men and women would do this, and not desert their posts?" "They Were Expendable" speaks eloquently not only for the defenders of the Philippines, but the brave souls who fought gallantly at Midway, Wake, and Guam. Outnumbered and out gunned, they fought on with no hope of relief or victory. The final scenes of the movie, where Wayne and Montgomery are sitting in tattered rags on the side of a dusty dirt road watching a convoy move past, is stunning in its simplicity. There is almost no dialog in this scene; just a quiet resignation that it is all but over. Their crews are now infantry, their boats are either sunk or handed over to the Army. Only fate at the last minute spares them what awaits their shipmates and fellows-in-arms with the coming surrender. Aboard the airplane that is the last to leave the island, character actor Leon Ames, who got aboard and then has to leave because the last two passengers showed up late, sums up the courage of all who were left behind when he simply asks someone to deliver a message to his wife. He then gets off the plane without a complaint. Truly John Ford directed just more than a war film here; he directed a gallant and heartfelt tribute to America's fighting men and women everywhere.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Most of the reviews I've read seem to miss the point of this poignant, moving story. With respect to the film itself, it is well acted, brilliantly directed, and the B&amp;W cinematography conveys the grittiness of the subject matter. To gain a better appreciation of the true story of MTB Squadron 3, read William L. White's magnificent book (same title). Lt. John Brickley = Lt. (later Admiral) John Bulkeley; Lt. Rusty Ryan = Lt. Robert Kelly; Ens. Tony Aiken = Ens. Anthony Akers; Ens. George Cross = Ens. George Cox. These were REAL people! I don't understand why John Ford didn't use their real names. Basically, these servicemen &amp; women were on the Titanic with all the lifeboats gone, and they knew it. There was no relief coming; the prospect of capture by the Japanese was, perhaps, worse than death; these people knew what the Japanese had done to captives in China and Southeast Asia. This is the story of remarkable grace and bravery under the worst possible conditions. Perhaps only the story of the siege of Wake Island (Dec. 7-23, 1941) rivals it for pure, true drama (too bad the movie about that one was all propaganda).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"As big as they come..."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of John Ford's best. There is a factoid circulating that this film, released in 1945 when we were about to end the war, was a flop because no one wanted to hear about a defeat in the Philippines, but Tad Gallagher's research shows this not to be true. It was a success, and for good reason.It's got about everything you'd expect in a war movie released during that year, and it's finely done. Beginning with the photography and location shooting, in which Florida provides a first-rate substitute for the Philippines. No bravura acting is apparent, and none is called for. Montgomery is stolid as the squadron commander. Wayne, as his exec, follows orders competently and even is rather moving when he recites Robert Louis Stevenson's epitaph during a funeral scene, foreshadowing his famous scene when he's given the gold watch in "She Wore a Yellow Ribbon." Marshall Thompson plays an inexperienced new man, not for the last time. Ward Bond is a hearty boatswain's mate. Donna Reed, looking enchanting, is Wayne's aborted love interest. She doesn't have much screen time, but good use is made of what she has, and after all, it's hard to bang a full-blown romance into this kind of film. It's pretty downbeat for Ford, when you come right down to it. One after another the "cardboard boxes" that, along with a handful of submarines, constituted MacArthur's navy are lost. Blown-up, wrecked, requisitioned by the Army, or just disappeared. The editing is fine too. Wayne's 34 boat is strafed and damaged by Japanese airplanes and he manages to beach it in a deserted area. He and his men struggle ashore through the surf. The planes return and they bomb it and strafe it until it erupts in flame, sending a geyser of seawater into the air. As Wayne emerges from cover there is a shot of him staring bleakly at his burning boat, then the seawater cascades over his figure forming a black-and-white rainbow as it does so. The eruption of water and its finally falling on Wayne's figure couldn't have been better times if a stopwatch had been used, a fine example of technical expertise.Made as it was during the war years, it couldn't be more realistic than it is. Sometimes this is a weakness, due not to Ford and his crew but to the strictures of the time. The MTBs were glamorous duty. They were developed during WWI, when ships were mainly designed to be big enough to outshoot other big ships, and torpedoes hadn't proved themselves. Well, they did during the first war, delivered by torpedo boats that were small and fast and could duck under the big guns to deliver their weapons. (The destroyer was originally meant to be a "torpedo boat destroyer.") In WWII they served in every theater and were valuable assets. But they weren't suitable for blue-water work and were mostly used in sheltered waters. "They Were Expendable" shows them attacking under fire at high speed, in some very exciting shots. In real life, as Richard Tregaskis has reported, the engines delivered about 40 knots when new -- fast, but not that fast. A bit faster than a new destroyer, about the same speed as a torpedo. But under conditions in which maintenance was difficult or impossible, as they were here, the efficiency of the engines dropped and so did the boat's speed. The usual technique was not to attack at full speed with flags flying, but to sneak up as quietly as possible on an enemy ship, launch the torpedoes, then get out quickly. Also the torpedoes malfunctioned frequently, and the launching mechanism used gunpowder which flashed when ignited and revealed the boat's position. By the end of the war the boats had reverted to a more primitive system in which the weapons were simply dumped overboard. But that has nothing to do with the movie except that these observations reveal the major action scenes to be what Gallagher calls a boy's matinee program. It didn't happen that way.Nevertheless, this is an honest movie. We lose, although we've done the best we can. And one of our boys can't kill a dozen of their boys. And you can tell Ford is behind the camera. Lots of booze. A reverence for authority. (MacArthur, whom his biographer, William Manchester, called "a remarkable man", is seen only from a distance, kind of like a spiritual vision seen in the clouds. MacArthur's complexity couldn't be dealt with, and shouldn't have been.)It's a well-done film, thoughtful and exciting. The enemy aren't referred to as Nips, nobody calls them names or tries to explain their motives. Hemingway may have enjoyed it if he ever saw it because it is a very nice illustration of "grace under pressure." See it if you can.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A tribute to those who were "expendable."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was a Saturday afternoon TV staple for kids who grew up in the 1950s and 60s. I remember watching it as a kid and being bored with the "adult" stuff and wanting John Wayne and company to sink "Jap" ships and win the war. It was only later, as I matured and had did a stint in the service myself that I revisited this movie. Made as the war was ending; it is a sentimental, but hard look at the early days of the war in the Philippines. Ford masterfully weaves the personal stories into the bigger picture of the onslaught of the Japanese machine through the Philippines. SPOILER ALERT: The scene of the old man not wanting to leave what he had built with the strains of "Red River Valley" playing in the background and him sitting with a rifle and looking down the road where the Japanese army will surely come, is a powerful image of the hopelessness that must have pervaded many at that time. An excellent movie and one that should be on anyone's list.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Glory in Defeat</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a movie i have started to love over time. What makes it fascinating for me is, that it does not tell again the heroic victories, but the early defeat the USA suffered, when it was hit left-footed by the Japanese attacks. This is a story about actually expendable small PT-Boots trying to slow down the Japanese advance on the Philippines without much of a success. Strong action on sea interwoven with a love story and very good character development by Robert Montgomery and John Wayne, accompanied by the then awfully young Cameron Mitchell and Marshal "Daktari" Thompson. And along is a whole crew of John Fords character stock, lead by Ward Bond. And above all is the Glory in Defeat, that is epitomized by the old shipyard owner, who refuses to leave his home even in the face of certain death by the advancing Japanese. The Love story is, to some extent, redundant, but that goes with it. Black and White, sometimes with continuity lost or hard to track, but nevertheless a timeless epic. 7/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Intertesting View From The Start of WWII</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Watching this movie in February, 2006, my first thought is how was this movie was received in 1945 vs now. It's hard to believe that Hollywood would make such a patriotic movie about what was essentially an embarrassing defeat for the USA. The armed forces between WWI and 1941 were allowed to whither away their effectiveness to the point that Roosevelt had no choice but to sacrifice the troops in the Philipines. Today, there would be calls for the impeachment of a president.The men on the PT boats remind me of Bogart in The Caine Mutiny - men willing to join the services before Pearl Harbor for low pay and little respect. They were willing to serve because they knew freedom isn't free.It's also interesting how MacArthur is portrayed. Before he left for Australia hew was referred to as Dugout Doug because he only went to the front 1 time. He also was criticized for not using his air corps to attack the Japanese before they reached the Phillipines. But by August, 1945 he had the led the Allies to Tokyo Bay for the surrender on the deck of the Missouri. Could Ford have made this movie in 1942 before Mac started his island hopping to Japan? Not the most exciting movie - especially for a war flick, but an interesting look at soldiers who got their orders and filled them to the best of their abilities - and often to their last breath.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Every time I read IMDb reviews or message boards, I am appalled at how much misinformation and ignorance I encounter. I am mystified about where some reviewers get their information and by what deficient process they form their opinions of a film's worth.If you want to know what reviewers thought back when a vintage film was first released, go to the online archives of newspapers such as The New York Times. In retrospect, the old-time reviewers were usually right on the money.To those reviewers who think They Were Expendable is sentimental, you're right. It's a John Ford film, after all. By all reports, John Ford was a dictatorial SOB who was a horror to work with, but he made great films. This is one of his best, if not THE best.To those reviewers who think this film is a fine portrayal of men's loyalty to their country and to each other in a truly tough time, you're right, too. And so are the reviewers who can crawl into the skin of the men who are portrayed here--in an impossible situation, without the ghost of a chance of relief, scared to death, and knowing that they are doomed.To those reviewers who find this film boring, I can only assume you don't know much about your own country's history. We almost lost that one. It was a scary time, with no good news anywhere.We are now at a stage in our country's history where there are no massive engagements such as World War 2, in which every family knew others in military service. When I was a little kid, almost every family on my street had a blue star service flag displayed in the window, and often a gold star flag indicating the death of someone in service. The war was emotionally close for a lot of people.The country hasn't been that way for a long, long time. I therefore assume that the bored reviewers are (1) young and have not experienced a time of genuine national emergency in which everyone was expected to sacrifice, and did; (2) are too conditioned by the way most recent films (which I see as boring) are presented; and (3) don't see that the story is everything. Luckily, these guys are in the minority. I just hope they don't reproduce.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It was interesting to note how some viewers panned this film for its lack of action. I'm a Korean vet who knows that war is not one prolonged battle after another. There are stretches of time where men,as this film so accurately shows, hurry up and wait for their next assignments. To me there is not one false note in this movie. Montgomery was a P.T boat commander in real life and handles his role with authority. John Wayne, Ward Bond and other familiar faces handle their roles well without exception.Even the love interest with Donna Reed doesn't impede the continuity of the story.In fact,it adds a soft note to an otherwise gritty war scene.Although shot in Florida, the locations easily pass for the Philippines ,the locale of the action. One can almost feel the heat and smell the dust of those islands ! This is not a story of one important battle such as The Longest Day, but rather a story of men trying to prove the value of their P.T boats,of their heroics and sacrifices, and in the end,doing their duties. Whether they agreed or not, they followed orders.One of the best of the war films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A fantastic story that was brilliantly told by John Ford.I love it! After having spent time in the Phillipines during the Vietnam war and having gone to Corregador, I thought about all of these characters. It was like a walk back in time to see Malinta tunnel where the hospital was. I never grow tired of watching this movie. I read the book, and there were many more facts than could be presented in a movie. It was a true tribute to the Men of the US Navy that fought a rear action to slow the Japanese advance. While there were many cliché's in the movie, it made me proud to serve in the US Navy. I thought that the battle scenes were very good for the time that they were made, and I was conscious of the fact when they showed "Dad" sitting in his shipyard waiting for the Japs to come, they played "Red River Valley" in the background. Probably a tribute to the Grapes of Wrath character "Pa Joad".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Top 10 WWII film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We watched this on the Memorial Day weekend while TCM was showing all the WWII films. This is probably the best film made, John Wayne is at the Top of his game, and the supporting actors are all perfectly cast.There are lots of racial slurs we would never say now, if you object please remember we weren't "politically correct" nor at that time would any one be upset at the words used. We were at war! This film is like being on a roller coaster, up emotionally, then down emotionally. I laughed, I cried, and I felt real patriotism. I know that most of these WWII films were propaganda for the war effort, but at the time, this was the best way to show the folks at home what the navy accomplished in the Phillipines. Too many people have forgotten how brave and honorable guys these men (and women) really were. We looked at a PT site, and looked closely at the real boats these guys worked on. It's amazing how much our veterans went through! Here it is Memorial Day weekend, we are in another War, and once again our Military Personnel is doing a great job! always say we'll never forget! So, I'm thankful to John Ford for his cockeyed loyalty to our country! Not enough true patriots left.Watch this and love it, don't worry about the ending... We all know the end of that conflict! Let's just remember what our fathers and grandfathers and great grandfathers were doing in their teenage years, and have some gratitude that they did what they did! This is an excellent film! 10 or better!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>John Ford + John Wayne + Robert Montgomery = a great war movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This has been one of my favorite movies for over 30 years. While basically dismissed at the time of its release because the war had already ended, it is now becoming recognized as one of the great movies to come out of WWII and one of the great war movies of all time. While sometimes overly patriotic (but it must be remembered that it was filmed DURING the war), it is still a top notch rendering of one of the truly heroic episodes of WWII. If you do any reading about PT boats and their service in the war, you can truly appreciate just how the odds were stacked against these men. Since this is based on a true story (by W.L. White as told to him by the too few men left of Motor Torpedo Boat Squadron 3), I have always wondered whether Rusty (Lt. Kelly in real life) ever found out what happened to Sandy(Peggy in real life).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great film inside another one</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are two films here, one wrapped around the other. The one that begins and ends the film is breezy, action-oriented, mostly shot outdoors. Better than Sands of Iwo Jima, but other than that fairly average WWII fare, even taking into account the fact that it is a largely accurate retelling of a tremendous defeat.The other film is mostly shot inside, either in the hospital or at social events, and is far darker and more moving. While Ford gives us some of his standard hokum, such as the trio hiding underneath the cottage, this section looks much harder at death, defeat and helplessness. The indoor setting is key, Ford had shot in shadows before, as in Grapes of Wrath, and he did again in My Darling Clementine. But the scenes in the hospital are even more evocative: they remind us that the war has only begun and that the worst lies ahead. And while some commentators have complained that this movie is too slow, in this section the slow pace makes the feeling of imminent loss that much more poignant. I'm thinking in particular of the scene when Donna Reed does her hair in the mirror before coming to the table. Here we not only get to feast our eyes, along with the officers waiting at the table a few feet away, at the impossibly beautiful Donna Reed, but we get a sense of what a struggle it must have been to try to maintain any sort of normal life in wartime.I don't suppose it would be possible to have sustained this note throughout the movie--no string quartet can be all adagio--but I wish the bookend sections had measured up to the middle section.</fullReview>

Perhaps Wayne should have done more supporting roles like this one with less flag waving and more portrayal of actual events and people.Can anyone tell me the title of the song that was played when John Wayne and Donna Reed were dancing about an hour into the film?

		<fullReview>One has to remember the time that this film was released-1945--so there is quite a bit of flag waving here . Especially with the attacks on the Japanese "cruisers " and sinking of a light Japanese aircraft carrier .No Japanese naval ships were indeed lost during this period , only 3 destroyers sunk by US submarines .As well when the PT boats were on their torpedo runs I am quite sure the Japanese ships were out of range of the machine guns firing from the PT boats.Indeed a summary of Japanese naval actions in this period list the cruiser Kuma (One torpedo struck bow but did not explode) South of Cebu 9 Apr 1942 by PT boats .The acting is understated which does work well.AS well the attacks of the Japanese aircraft is quite realistic no CGI here .The fall of the Philippines is indeed a fascinating subject .The mistakes,bravery, and suffering of the allied forces deserves a modern treatment -now that most of the facts are known .Hoping that film will be made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is just a Hollywood Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My father joined the Navy in 1934; he was stationed on PT boats and was at the Brooklyn Naval Shipyard when the Japanese attacked Pearl; he and his squadron were sent straight to the Pacific where they stayed the whole war. He died last year at 96. He had stories about his duty on the PT boats; fortunately for him his boat was destroyed when he was on a leave; which is why I am here today to write this. He was a radioman 1st class; then promoted to radioman chief. He was a humble man, and pretty much told it like it was. His written comments on this book were mostly "bull" and "that's not the way it happened". It was dangerous and they did not get any respect. But it was definitely glamorized in the movie, which shows you how bad it really was. He liked Robert Montgomery as an actor, but said he was a snobby officer. And Kennedy was called a 90-day-wanderer who was privileged and got in over his head and got his boat cut in half. The movie is entertaining because I like Montgomery and John Wayne. I do think that Ford treated Wayne shabbily; John Wayne volunteered, but the War Dept. told him he would be of better use making morale-building movies. Sure doesn't sound like our sorry government of today!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It rises above the history around it and makes for a great, well made movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>They Were Expendable (1945)Start with some perspective, in the months just after World War Two has ended. John Ford, the director, was by now widely recognized as one of America's greatest. After years of smaller successes, he hit it big with "Grapes of Wrath" and "Young Mr. Lincoln" right before the war. And in "Stagecoach" (1939) he helped revive the Western, and John Wayne's faltering career. By 1945 John Wayne was known for his sturdy, no-nonsense common sense approach to life, and love.Both men were the kind of Republican that meant individual freedom and self-reliance as much as patriotism (and not the Reagan style moralizing Republican). It is the rugged self-made-man sense that works to well here, because now John Wayne is in the military, the navy, just as the Japanese are invading (successfully) the Philippines. And in the military you have to follow orders. When Wayne wants to stay behind for love, and push on for military glory, he is forced to change his mind.Not that the men don't have individual traits. They do, in that great John Ford fashion, building up believable types in a group of characters. And the other lead, the main lead in fact (who directed part of the film when Ford was ill), is Robert Montgomery. Montgomery was a leading man of a different kind than Wayne, famous not for Westerns and war films, but everyday dramas and comedies. And he had been an actual PT boat commander in the war, and knew something about it that was irreplaceable.In fact, the film is remarkable for its verisimilitude--its convincingness, in both the broad sweep (the advance of the Japanese) and the details (all the things that make a movie make sense without distraction). While filmed in Florida, it looks completely like the Philippines, and the boats and planes (American planes, all of them--the great Mitsubishi Zero planes that wreaked havoc in the first year of the war were mostly destroyed) are real. The battle scenes as much as the straw hut barracks scenes are all believable, as much as Hollywood can pull off. There are times when you see the PT boats pushing toward a Japanese ship and a hundred shells hit within feet of the boat but never strike, and you it seems like terribly good luck, but I think the fear and the sense of probably death are what matters most.And survival. The title of the movie is actual a daring one, because it reminds viewers, many still straggling in from the theater of war to the hometown movie theater, that the war was brutal. And that meant that horrifying decisions were made, or were made for the troops because of circumstance. That is, as the Japanese swept across the Philippine islands, the withdrawal of American troops was incomplete and disorganized. Not only were many men sent to battle with little chance of winning, many others were simply left behind. It is frankly the kind of warfare we might not tolerate any longer--or that might make warmongers of many of us who proclaim peace above everything in relative peacetime. It does, also, make you see what a different, controlled kind of wars the mideast wars are, with casualties and bravery, but overall a sense of measured risk and step by step planning, backwards or forwards.Honestly, I'm not a war film fan. But I love good movies, and this is a good movie. It feels a little long by the time you hit two hours, but it never resorts to sentimentalism for its own sake. Many of the character actors (side actors) are terrific, including Donna Reed in a Donna Reedesque role (the sweet pretty girl who is just slightly unattainable). Wayne is in great form, I think, a carryover from "Stagecoach" but in a new universe. And Montgomery in his quiet way is admirably strong and central to making these troops, and the movie, proceed with determination.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Even with authentic like battle scenes, this is a pretty routine World War 11 film. People say that it doesn't end happily, but since when did World War 11 or any major conflict suppose to be a happy time?Fortunately, it's not a preachy film. That being said, John Wayne gives a memorable eulogy for a fallen colleague near the end of the film.At least, the film may have provided a framework for a geography lesson regarding Corregidor and Bataan.The film showed the coordination between the army and navy in the fight for these areas.Donna Reed briefly appears as the tough nurse who Wayne falls for. She is a far different World War 11 Reed than what she would be 8 years later when she said to Monty Clift: "What did the army ever do for you." Imagine saying that to John Wayne in a film!!!!! No way.Yes, the closeness between the men serving is discussed but we see little to no character development among these men. In addition, co-star Robert Montgomery, isn't given that much to do here.Look for very young guys-Marshall Thompson and Cameron Mitchell among others.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie pays homage to the American soldiers, sailors, airmen, nurses and civilians who answered the call of duty during some of the darkest hours in the war in the Pacific against Japan during the days after the attack on Pearl Harbor. Although the title of the movie suggests otherwise, none of the brave Americans portrayed in this movie were expendable; each one served their country and did what duty required as part of the war effort, and unlike the wars of today, in this movie there is no ambiguity of purpose, no second-guessing, none of the self-doubt that questions the credibility of why they fight. True there are some who might criticize this movie for its attempts at sentimentality, which seem oddly out of place within the context of the nature of the story, or maybe question why the United States did not more accurately appreciate the Japanese threat to the Philippines and placed its forces in such a vulnerable strategic position resulting in probably the worst single military defeat in U. S. history, but maybe that was just the way movies were made at the time. The cast was great, with Robert Montgomery, John Wayne, Donna Reed, Ward Bond and many others, all of whom give wonderful performances. It's too bad that Ms. Reed was not included in more scenes. But what makes this movie especially effective is the story itself, about Bataan, Corregidor, and the brave Americans who did their utmost under the most challenging circumstances to stave off the enemy and defend the United States until help could arrive, help which they knew would not be immediately forthcoming, the knowledge of which nonetheless did not deter them from doing their duty. Excellent movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a longer way from eternity to here</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Donna Reed's performance as a nurse on Corregador is more nuanced and sincere, with solid chemistry between her and John Wayne, than hers as a prostitute in "From Here to Eternity," opposite method-actor Montgomery Clift ("? a long way from here to eternity, a longer way from eternity to here." was part of her acceptance speech when she received the Oscar, perhaps awarded as an apology... for Fred Zinnemann's casting her as a prostitute... six years later at the Pantages Theater.) In "They Were Expendable," Wayne's energy plays off Robert Montgomery's authority, and with John Ford, Wayne's usual wise-ass demeanor is under control, effectively making this a buddy picture but one of great subtlety and pathos: the storyline tracks the U.S.Navy's retreat from the Philippines, leaving many crew members to face what became the Bataan death march? The attack sequences of the PT boats going up against Japanese cruisers are unbelievable, matching up Ford's eye for spectacle with anything he did later in Monument Valley. That this film did not do particularly well at the box-office suggests that it came too late, released in early 1946... that audiences had already plunged into superficiality and were interested in a new reality, not to be reminded of a vulnerable recent past.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great John Ford Production</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film held my interest from the very beginning to the very end and there was plenty of action involving the Navy PT Boats and how they were first introduced into World War II in the Pacific. At first the Navy considered the P T Boat as a mere small vessel meant only to be a mail carrier or transport vehicle until they found out just how valuable they became in the war against Japan. Robert Montgomery, (Lt. John Brickley) commanded his squadron of men including John Wayne, Lt.(j.g.) Rusty Ryan who both worked together to provided the Navy with the best performance the P T Boats had when they were utilized for destroying large Japanese boats and munitions. John Ford, the producer managed to bring some romance into this war picture with the young charms of Donna Reed, (Lt. Sandy Davyes) who was an Army Nurse and very sweet on Rusty Ryan. In real life, Robert Montgomery actually was a P T Boat Commander during World War II and was very admired by John Ford who did his best to outshine John Wayne who had no military experience. Great film, enjoy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I could care less how true-to-life this film is. I barely care that it is a war movie. What strikes me and moves me in the understatement, the chill, the perfect handling of the atmosphere of loss and defeat. The use of figures half-masked in shadow is so ominous. The phone call between the lovers brutally cut off in mid-sentence is a masterpiece of Fordian style: the individual is constantly having to be sacrificed for an accepted idea of the "greater good". It is clear that Ford believes in this idea. But his greatness as an artist does not allow him to make this one dimensional. At every moment, right from the beginning, he shows the pain and bitterness in the thwarted hopes and plans of his characters. The lulling routine of mail runs, competitiveness, palm trees swaying - all accompanied by a lightly uplifting little tune - places the inevitable fate of those left behind in high contrast. He underscores their awareness of what awaits them with masterful understatement. But the nearness of torture and death is evident in virtually every scene. Those who find the film dull are responding (negatively) to a very personal, very particular handling of cinematic rhythm. The atmosphere of the film is that of a slow, gradual liquidation,beginning with what is supposed to be a glorious display of power and potency - cruelly nipped in the bud - and culminating in the image of a handful of bruised survivors straggling down the beach towards their fate. A modernist sensibility of anti-heroism is constantly counterpoised with a belief in patriotic values. What other movie has been able to keep these two contrasting ideas in focus throughout?</fullReview>

The feel of this was very downbeat, sad, melancholy. Wayne is reserved and believable, Montgomery oozes credibility playing the role he served in WWII as a PT boat captain. The familiar faces-Bond, Heydt, Reed, Mitchell, etc all serve to elevate this into something more. In WWII, we didn't just start winning everything in sight from day one.

		<shortDescription>Night and Day</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One could search for years and not find a book and screenplay as different as night and day. The book is essentially a play by play of those first few awful months of WWII in the pacific, as told by the crews of RON-3 while the movie is a Hollywood adaptation of what seems to be several different stories. With that said, I would like to add that I don't think it could have been done any better. A direct adaptation of the book would have come off more like a documentary than a drama, where the movie, adapted for print could have been a compilation of two or more stories. The book is a wonderful read, and the movie does an excellent job of recreating, with embellishments of course, those first months when it seemed as though the Japs would be unstoppable. I suggest reading the book and watching the movie without expecting a carbon copy on film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Director's choice</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Other's on this list have told the plot, so I won't. It is based on a true story. Ford was a serving Naval officer in a special photographic unit of the Office of Strategic Services. During D Day he was in a PT Boat off the Normandy coast with the commander of the PT Boat Squadron depicted in the film. Shortly afterward Ford was released from active duty specifically to make a film to show the sacrifice of the returning veterans to the nation at home. This was the story he chose to make, a defeat.This film and "Saving Private Ryan" were made for the same reasons, to pay homage to the veterans of WWII, one from a veteran and one from the son of a veteran. Its interesting to consider the differences in what the story they desided to tell and how they told it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of my favorite John Ford films, and one of the best films about WW2. "They Were Expendable" is about the fall of the Philippines, beginning with the period around Pearl Harbor and following up to the time of the evacuation to Australia. Some very nicely done scenes with the usual fine Ford touch - the candlelight dinner, a phone call between Wayne and Donna Reed, the scene near the end on the plane. The movie captures the hopeless situation the American sailors and soldiers found themselve in and the courage they showed in the face of inevitable defeat.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'll say straight away why I wanted to see what this film was like. I watched It's A Wonderful Life a few days ago, and within that fantastic movie was a wonderful performance by Donna Reed, who, to be honest, I knew little of (apart from Dallas!). So anyway, I noticed she was in this movie, and as it was on cable tv, I decided to watch it. I've never been a fan of John Wayne, but also never had anything against him, so I watched it with an open mind.Well, what a great movie! A very understated performance by Wayne, ably supported by the 'average sailors doing their job', and for me at least, a great (if short) performance by Reed, as the nurse everyone loved!I have to say, I'm surprised she doesn't seem to be as recognised as other leading ladies from that time, and that apart from the movies mentioned and From Here To Eternity, she didn't seem to have too many big roles.Overall, one of the top wartime movies, superbly directed and performed by all, with Wayne, Reed and Robert Montgomery in particular.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best movie about the Navy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the most true-to-life movie about the U.S. Navy. It is one of the top ten war movies. The first time I paid attention to it thirty years ago, I was in the Navy. The movie has released 30 years earlier in 1945. The action is around the outbreak of WWII in The Phillipines. John Ford expertly shows the viewpoint of the common sailor (young and experienced) and with junior officers. There is a lot of the "hurry-up and wait" of every day navy life, interspersed with suicidal PT boat attacks on large Japanese ships. John Wayne is a little over the top as the gung-ho LtJG second in command: He would have been busted for yelling in a naval hospital. As a regular sailor, one could only hope to have a commander as cool and fair as Robert Montgomery playing Lt. (Brick) Brickley. Donna Reed's (won't spoil) character will get you thinking about how fate could intervene in the middle of a phone call. Supporting cast is superb with Ward Bond, John Holt and Marshall Thompson leading with such widely different characters. They Were Expendable is as real to the Navy as The Story of G.I. Joe is to the army. Completely opposite to the take of a movie about generals or admirals such as Patton or Tora Tora Tora.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excessively subtle</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After studying "They Were Expendable" in a film class, I understand and respect what John Ford was trying to do in this film. Here is a World War II movie that is subtle rather than bombastic, quietly rather than forcefully patriotic. The enemy is not presented as evil or cartoonish. In fact, Japanese soldiers are never even shown, though you do get to see Japanese planes and ships in some beautifully orchestrated and filmed battle scenes.But my initial reaction to "They Were Expendable", before I was forced to think this long and hard about it, was one of boredom. The plot is episodic and sometimes hard to follow, a function of Ford's restrained approach to film-making. A 1945 audience, familiar with the story of what happened in the Philippines, would have understood exactly what Ford was getting at, but for a modern viewer, it's more difficult. For instance, during a sequence featuring General MacArthur, no one ever says "MacArthur", which confused me on my first viewing.The characters in "They Were Expendable" are not particularly interesting, and many of the minor characters lack definition. Even the heroes, Lieutenant Brickley (Robert Montgomery) and his friend Rusty (John Wayne), have rudimentary personalities. Brickley is wise, responsible, and does his best to please both his commanders and his subordinates; Rusty is a frustrated young man, impatient for glory. Though both men undergo a few internal conflicts, their behavior is always predictable."They Were Expendable" chronicles one of the worst defeats in U.S. military history, the fall of the Philippines early in World War II. But while the film's tone is slow and somber, it never delivers the sense of utter tragedy and loss that this story deserves. In 1945, John Ford could make a war movie that was understated and allusive, knowing that his audience would fill in the blanks. Sixty years later, this film has lost much of its power, and its shortcomings in the areas of plot, character, and mood are now apparent.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's taken me 3 viewings to conclude that this movie just does not work. The throughline and dramatic arc are D.O.A.; with any impact split and weakened between dual male leads (John Wayne, Robert Montgomery), neither of whom you warm to, and a very looooooong opening 45 minutes lost to dramatic fumbles. What threw me off, is that every frame of it looks like a b&amp;w Rembrandt. It's unusually well-composed, and certain vivid settings (The hospital at Corregidor, a thatch-hut turned into a make-out den) rate as high points among ALL the films I've seen. The footage of Japanese planes dive-bombing swift boats is thrilling and impressive.Individual moments stand out, but the movie is a fragmented, episodic muddle. Ford underplays everything to the point of exasperation. So the score has to work twice as hard to to convince you that unnoticeable plot "developments" matter, because their significance is below the threshold of human perception. Visible emotions are regarded as intrusions to be reduced or omitted. Characters are continually succumbing (offscreen) presumably to chronic cases of under-utilization. 30 chapters of this would be more than enough, but there are 44. The movie has lost its way and devolved into a hopelessly uniform texture of middle-gray long before it ends. Wayne, who managed not to serve in WW2, plays his character as an irritable jerk, probably in the hope he would look strong/patriotic and avoid charges of cowardice, or being a chicken-hawk. And as usual, Ford's ham-handed use of a few motifs parlays American standards (Anchors Aweigh, Over There and Red River Valley???) into major annoyances via clumsy and thoughtless repetition. 'They Were Expendable' is a seriously uptight movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quite a Good Movie, Really.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Big John Wayne gets second-billing to Robert Montgomery in this early stage of his career. There's no particularly dominant theme other than that things are going pear-shaped.It's life in the Pacific theatre during WW2. American forces are going about their jobs and facing the apparently unstoppable juggernaut of Imperial Japan after it more-or-less rolled-up the British like a cheap carpet. Now it's the Yanks turn. This is not a full in-yer-face set-piece war movie, but rather about the gradual disintegration of mounting reversals largely out of view, and how they impact upon people at a local level. It's very personal. Relationships feature as much as conflict. The vagaries of war are brought into sudden and sharp focus by local attacks and the immediacy of death. Retreat becomes fractious and confused. Not everyone is gonna get away.Most of the action turns around a squad of American PT boats. And here the movie excels in its depiction of these splendid vessels powering through the seas. There's some really nice sequences and it's well worth a watch for PT boat fans. We get to see "I shall return" General McArthur doing a runner with surprising egg-suck frankness, considering how America never liked to advertise its military failures.Acting is believable by all concerned. Editing &amp; other technical issues are all of the standard that gave John Ford his reputation. It's a long movie at over 130mins, but seldom drags on account of its good mix of action and story. Filmed in B&amp;W.I'm surprised this work doesn't feature more highly in popularity lists. It's got a helluva lot going for it in an understated, almost British-like stiff-upper-lip way.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"They Were Expendable" was the first film that John Ford filmed nothing but return to Hollywood, is Ford's homage to the men who, like him, had left home and family, not knowing if they would see. Based on true events and placed in the first months of the Pacific war, at a time when the Japanese were defeated American troops, Ford film does not follow, however, the patterns of war movies of the moment.Ford will be remembered for its humanized and very few westerns in violent content but "They Were Expendable" continues to be one of those westerns where "Stagecoaches" and the "Ponny Express" are replaced by torpedo boats and the unsung heroes change arenas the deserts of the Wild West by the blue waters of the ocean that lives up to its name, the Pacific.Ford, newly returned from the conflict which had filmed documentaries for the US Navy, with the help of the direction of Robert Montgomery himself composed this tribute to both the anonymous American soldier as the hero "John Bulkeley" in the film's last name " Brickley "and is played by Montgomery who provided real services in the Philippines and where, again, with the participation of the" usual "John Wayne and Ward Bond and Donna Reed splendid a character in love nurse producer put tightly in the argument.Surprisingly for those who observe these events from the perspective that comes with age, this simultaneity of feelings: On the one hand the distress and despair of the soldiers not to take action, and furthermore, the soldier trembles with fear. Ford filmed his memories. He did not stop in the macabre horror show really was. He drew with such a fine line that did not even find an enemy soldier's face. Fear and did not require real courage factions or defined contours. The unknown also terrified. Shrapnel, wherever it comes, with its cargo of death and destruction also turns the spirits.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>After the War</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This the first feature film John Ford made immediately after the Second World War, and, in the main titles, he is credited by his military rank. Although, the film is a deeply patriotic tribute to the little boats and the big men who were truly expendable in the larger picture, the film is notable for its unmistakable understatement. It is as if Ford, always given to cinema melodramatics in the name of a good show, somehow restrained himself, perhaps because the memory of what really happened, rather than what the establishment wanted its citizens to believe, was still very fresh in his mind. For once, he chose to tell the truth and not exaggerate. The performances from the starring roles to the bits are also particularly subdued and real. No false heroics. The handsome leading man and light comedian Robert Montgomery, who in real life was a PT boat commander, was never better. The mood of the film is enormously helped by the realistic semi-documentary cinematography of Joe August, whom Ford knew and collaborated with the early days of the silent cowboy film. August's lighting, often leaving characters in shadow or half-light, was very courageous for the time. Few big studio DPs, with the exception of Greg Toland, had the guts or the talent to avoid the clichés of big studio glamor lighting and try for something that looks at times very much like the documentaries Ford had made with his war-time naval unit. Today, Ford, one of the masters of the language of film, is often put down for his jingoism, but, as this film demonstrates, he was at his best a master story-teller and humanist.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"You and I are professionals"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the months and years following the end of the Second World War there came a wave of pictures dealing directly with the recent conflict. Many filmmakers had had first hand experience of combat, or had at least made films for training and propaganda, and there were plenty of real life stories for screenwriters to dramatise. The war films of this period are among the best the genre has ever produced.The director's chair on this one was filled by John "I make Westerns" Ford, right around the point where he began specialising in the Western genre. Ford's statement on his work was not as flippant as it sounds, because as we see here at this period he really shot every picture (at least every action one) in the same manner as his Westerns, as if he were truly stuck in the one mode. In this case, he simply swaps the open plain for the open sea. The result is surprisingly effective.You see Ford was not the best director of action sequences, nor of drama, nor really of any individual aspect of a feature. But the way he shot each portion made it work within the overall structure. Just as he did with homesteads in a Western, Ford photographs the navy base with an emphasis on its smallness, making the ceiling visible or framing the characters with foreground clutter. Often the outside world can be seen in some corner of the shot through a window or below a canopy, as a reminder of its existence. After a while, the effect makes us yearn for the openness of the ocean, and helps build up our excitement as we head towards an action scene. When we do get out on the open sea, the atmosphere is one of freedom, albeit tinged with fear as these tiny boats seem horribly exposed and vulnerable in the vast seascape.And it's an effect that can work both ways. In the chaotic nighttime battle sequence, the exterior is closed in and the horizon lined with trees on the shore. When the dilapidated ships return home, it is the base that seems light and open. Then, when we return to those enclosed interiors, they suddenly feel very safe and homely, and this helps key us back into the human story.Lead man John Wayne was by now a star that had officially risen, and what's more people were starting to realise he could actually act, and needn't just be a rugged physical presence. But this doesn't really feel like the Duke's movie. Nor does it really seem to belong to his co-star Robert Montgomery, who still being the more prestigious actor got top-billing. The reason has again to do with how it's filmed. The real star here is not an individual ? it is the little community of these military personnel. It is not the big names who get treated to the biggest close-ups, it is bit players and extras, representatives of the crowd. The centrepiece of the makeshift romantic dinner is not the interplay between the Duke and Donna Reed, it is the heartfelt singing of his comrades-in-arms. The two lead men are really just there to look reassuringly familiar and say all the important lines. In They Were Expendable it is implicit that every serviceman and servicewoman is a hero.Speaking of which, They Were Expendable and the other war flicks of the immediate post-war period were in fact not very popular with those who had seen active service, and did not do especially well at the box office. For many the events were too recent and the memories too painful. The war picture did not really rise to popular prominence until the late 40s, with such examples as Battleground and Sands of Iwo Jima, when there was a new generation of moviegoers who had were too young to have been directly affected by the war, plus the fact that such features were being pushed as propaganda for the new conflict in Korea. But regardless of their historical context, realistic, poignant and rousing pictures like this one remain as solid entertainment for us today.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The most astonishing thing about this movie, other than the assurance of its direction and the fine performances by all of the players, is its modernity. Ford is not presenting a jingoistic, ultra-patriotic, flag-waving view of war. Instead he is commenting on the ironies, and the human waste, of warfare. At the time, Ford was even criticized for making a film about defeat, rather than victory. His point was precisely that with the early sacrifices of defeat, ultimate victory is impossible. Ford portrays warfare realistically and without the sentimentality that too often mars even his best work. It is also interesting for Donna Reed's performance, one of the few times in his early or middle periods that Ford portrays a self-assured, modern woman who is neither a Madonna nor a whore.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Before "PT-109" Immortalized MTBs, There Was "They Were Expendable"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>John Ford's "They Were Expendable" ranks as one of the all time great World War II epics about the U.S. Navy. Ford helmed this action-packed adventure during the waning days of the war. This black &amp; white yarn about the darkest, earliest days of the war deals with the problems that PT-boat skippers had trying to convince the Navy brass about the utility of their gunboats. The film opens with the plywood vessels of Motor Torpedo Boat Squadron 3 performing maneuvers in the Philippines on the eve of Pearl Harbor. The Navy brass admires the way that the boats handle, their speed and maneuverability, but they remain skeptical about their use. Admiral Blackwell prefers something withmore armament like a destroyer under his feet to these lightweight boats. The title reflects the brass's attitude toward these boats. Lieutenant John Brickley (Robert Montgomery of "The Divorcée") and Lieutenant J.G. Rusty Ryan (John Wayne of "Stagecoach") have an uphill battle on their hands as they struggle to convince the Navy that their PT-boats can make a difference. "They Were Expendable" exempllifies how warfare and tactics change before the tacticians accept those changes. The Navy brass are accustomed to fighting naval battles the way that they were fought during the First World War, and they are reluctant to alter their attitudes. Ostensibly, the film is based on the actual exploits of Brickley and the events surrounding the fall of the Philippines between December 1941 and April 1942 when the United States was losing the war.John Ford had seen war first-hand before he helmed "They Were Expendable" and he made it for the Navy to promote the use of PT-boats, The war ended, however, before MGM released the film and studio chief Louis B. Mayer dumped it because audiences had grown weary of watching such fare. Consequently, the film languished in obscurity despite its fine performances, top-notch action footage, understated humor, and atmospheric surroundings. In any case, "They Were Expendable" wasn't the usual propaganda movies. Ford refused to insert the typical morale boosting messages about the moral superiority of America over its treacherous Japanese enemy. In fact, we never see a single Japanese face throughout the film's lengthy 135 minute running time. Nobody delivers any speeches calculated to arouse patriotic fervor and "They Were Expendable" doesn't wave flags at us in every frame.This isn't the kind of movie that would make you rush down to the Navy recruiting office to sign up for combat. Indeed, the John Wayne character spends more time in a hospital on Corregidor recuperating from an apparently minor wound that they received when Japanese aircraft strafed his boat and nicked him in the finger. Just when the Navy brass gives Brinkley and he a chance to prove the relevance of their boats, Brinkley sends the disgruntled Ryan off to a hospital. Everybody warns Ryan that he also lost his arm to a case of blood poisoning, but the hardheaded Ryan is slow to realize the enormity of his wound. While Brinkley and company are away fighting the war, Ryan finds himself cooped up with other casualties, but itching to get back into combat. During his stay in the hospital, Ryan becomes romantically involved with a Navy nurse, Lieutenant Sandy Davys (Donna Reed of "From Here to Eternity"), who initially doesn't like Ryan's headstrong ways."They Were Expendable" looks authentic from stem to stern. The Navy furnished actual torpedo boats for the production and this represented Ford's first movie since he had gotten back from shooting real combat sequences for the military. Ford had served as the captain of the Navy Photographic Field Unit and his documentaries "The Battle of Midway" (1942) and "December 7th (1943) won Oscars. The production took place after Ford went on leave from the Navy in October 1942. Like Lesley H. Martinson's "PT-109," "They Were Expendable" was lensed on location in Florida, with Key Biscayne substituting splendidly for the Philippines. The battle sequences are first-rate and you get a palpable feeling about what it was like to be aboard a PT-boat under attack from Japanese aircraft. The scene when Rusty receives his wound is terrific. The Japanese aircraft buzz overhead, stitching the boats with gunfire as the PT-boat gunners unleash barrages from their .50 caliber machine guns. The explosions look terrific and nobody appears to be afraid of getting wet because the explosions throw up so much water that the PT-boat crews get baptized in the process.About half-way through the action after Rusty rejoins Brinkley, our heroes find themselves between a rock and a half place. They are limited supplies and have to do some Indian giving to obtain torpedoes for their boats. Eventually, they lose their boats and are reduced to playing dog soldiers during the fall of Bataan. Earlier in the narrative, when Brinkley and Ryan are forced to running a messenger service for the brass, they are called upon to evacuate General Douglas MacArthur to safety. When Brinkley's boat returns from a mission where they destroyed a Japanese cruiser, the other seaman play down the importance of their mission. Two-time Oscar nominated photographer Joseph August makes the action appear convincing. His superlative photography captures the gritty nature of warfare as well as the alienation and loneliness of the men who suffer with nothing to do but obey orders. The interiors of the Navy hospital on Corregidor resemble a film noir movie. "They Were Expendable" doesn't indulge in phony heroics. Robert Montgomery drew on his real-life experiences as a naval commander during Normandy so his performance really looks believable. Of course, the John Ford stock company fleshes out the action, notably with the ever-present Ward Bond as one of the veteran sailors.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>. . . perhaps the largest mass surrender of U.S. Troops occurred when a Yankee Territory on the fast track to statehood (as in, a getting its own star on our Stars &amp; Stripes Flag) was overrun by the Japanese in 1941. The statehood idea was scotched when most of the POW's were killed. It's as if Geronimo had occupied Arizona 60 years earlier, and after he was dislodged the U.S. had backed away from such "vulnerable" Territory, allow Phoenix to become the Capital of its own Country. THEY WERE EXPENDABLE shows how such a debacle happened on a FAR LARGER SCALE during the 1940s. Up until losing everything due to poor planning, U.S. dollars were the actual currency of the Philippines, as they were in Panama when future Presidential Nominee John McCain was born there. But after the fighters of the tiny island Japan tore away so many chunks of U.S. Territory in the Early 1940s, only Alaska and Hawaii were allowed to become new states (since they were each attacked or occupied only briefly), and all Other Territories became expendable. Most of these, such as the Philippines and Panama, have been given away already--China plans on having the rest for itself shortly. Cynical film director John Ford uses THEY WERE EXPENDABLE to show that American women (represented here by Donna Reed) ALWAYS will be expendable, as well as the older members of any American Labor Pool, such as Gen. Martin, Maj. Morton, and Capt. Carter here.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best war film ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although this film was made more than 60 years ago, it is in my opinion the best war film ever made. It 's dramatic understatement is brilliant film-making. Notice how often characters are allowed to move away from the camera and have a conversation that you are not privileged to listen to. It's a pity today's directors don't use this technique to create tension and mystery. It also portrays a world that has almost vanished in just one lifetime. Notice how in the early bar scene of the enlisted men and non-Com's, the youngest sailors are only allowed to drink a small beer or milk! Self sacrifice and duty permeate the whole film. The scene when General McArthy leaves the Phillapines is particularly stirring. I cannot recommend this film highly enough!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A profound tribute</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lieutenant Brickley(Robert Montgomery)commands a small squadron of motor torpedo boats(or PT boats)in the U.S navy. Brass is sceptical of the effectiveness of his boats in a war situation but when the Japanese attack Pearl Harbour the PT boats are assigned to the military as couriers. Brickley and his men receive their baptism of fire when the squadron successfully attacks and sinks a Japanese cruiser. The U.S army continues to suffer heavy casualties on Bataan and Corregidor and Brickley's PT boats are ordered to evacuate General MacArthur and his staff from the Philippines. The PT boats continue to prove their worth in the battle of the Phillipines as they mount more unrelenting attacks on Japanese shipping.John Ford's sincere tribute to the motor torpedo boat squadrons and their role in the Pacific campaign of the second world war is ultimately fulfilling, if not corny in parts. Shot whilst the war was still raging and released shortly after it ended, They Were Expendable is one of many red blooded flag-wavers churned out by Hollywood around this time. Despite being painfully unrealistic. I did enjoy this one. Ford's masterful direction and profound style of storytelling set this movie apart from the rest. Although it is a little too long and there is a fair amount of padding in the form of a mushy romantic subplot that has been replicated in nearly every war movie since. There were a lot of dour scenes that I quickly lost interest in. The film also contains a lot of sugar coated sentiment about sacrifice and patriotism which is laid on rather thick, particularly in the final scene. However this is only reflective of the time in which the movie was made. They Were Expendable is carried by staunch talent. Many think this is a John Wayne movie, but the young Wayne plays a secondary character to Robert Montgomery. Although he still gets plenty of screen time and his character is crucial to the film's plot. The duke was forced to endure severe verbal abuse from John Ford throughout shooting because he hadn't served during the war. This abuse is said to have got so serious that Robert Montgomery intervened and told Ford to stop, thus reducing the director to tears. Regardless, John Wayne still gives a great performance and gets to command his own PT boat. Robert Montgomery is excellent in the lead as the tough skipper who rallies his men and boats against the might of the Japanese navy and air force. Ward Bond and other members of the "John Ford Stock Company" acquitted themselves well too. Jack Holt gave a fine turn as the granite jawed General Martin and B movie actor Al Bridge made an unbilled appearance as a Lieutenant Colonel.The movie was skilfully photographed in such a way that captured the intensity of combat. There are four taut battle scenes which are peppered throughout the movie's duration. I was actually impressed by the special effects which I thought were brilliant for a film made in 1945.In the 1940s They Were Expendable was just another propaganda war movie. Today it is a dated but deep homage to the men of the motor torpedo boat squadrons and the way in which they carried out their duties. 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>First To Fight, First To Die</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Released at the end of World War II, with the ink on the final surrender documents still fresh, "They Were Expendable" is a rousing yet sobering look back when American service personnel faced total defeat at enemy hands. It's not a question of "if" for them, just "when," and this is director John Ford's way of paying tribute.We open in December, 1941, as Lt. John Brickley (Robert Montgomery) is trying to make his superiors see the value of the squadron of PT- boats he commands, presently stationed on Cavite in the Philippines. The brass is not impressed, but then the Japanese begin their offensive and Brickley and his men are put to the test. Can these "high-powered canoes" be counted on to help turn the tide of Japanese cruisers and destroyers?Not really, not for long.Surprisingly for a film made while the war in the Pacific still raged, there is an overall tone of resignation bordering on despair, beginning with the title. A lot of things turn out expendable in this movie, not just the PT-boats and the rest of the American forces in the Philippines, but comradeships formed within the squadron, too. Brickley's second-in-command Rusty Ryan (John Wayne) even has to shed a promising romance with nurse Sandy Davyss (Donna Reed) as the exigencies of war take precedence.The message of "do-and-die" is presented early by Brickley's commander: "You and I are professionals. If the manager says sacrifice, we lay down a bunt and let somebody else hit the home runs."Wayne is the reason people watch "Expendable," but Montgomery is why it sticks. A combat veteran just back from the war, he keeps it real with a low-key performance. There's no shouting when he issues commands, just firm authority. No longer the pretty boy of 1930s cinema, Montgomery is haggard-looking here, with bags under his eyes, a five-'o-clock shadow, and a noticeable paunch. He's not trying to impress anyone, which is why he is so impressive."Who are you working for?" is something he asks Rusty at key moments in the beginning and at the end of the film. This is the moral of the picture, reminding us of the sacrifice being laid.For Ford and screenwriter Frank "Spig" Wead, that sacrifice takes precedence over story. "They Were Expendable" is an episodic, sometimes rambling affair, with more than a bit of hyperbole about what the PT-boats accomplished. Much time is taken up with the squadron's part in the evacuation of Gen. Douglas MacArthur, whom Ford treats as such a holy thing he is never referred to by name. He's simply called "certain key personnel" and draws admiring stares from all. It's understandable given MacArthur's credited role in turning the war, but it does grate.The pathos is deep, but never overwhelming. A deathbed scene between Brickley and one of his officers, whom we earlier see being introduced to the rest the squadron on the eve of the Pearl Harbor attack, is a masterful study of actorly control by both Montgomery and Paul Langton. Several key players in the Ford acting troupe have standout scenes, and with Ford manage to incorporate needed doses of humor in small but strategic ways.I really like Wayne in this movie; already a star, we see him here beginning to emerge as an actor, whether grousing about PT-duty early on, making a hash of an attempt at telling Sandy he loves her on a bad telephone connection, or reciting verse over two dead comrades. While Montgomery sets the tone of the film, Wayne provides the crucial backbone for it to work.In a way, the great strength of "They Were Expendable" is also a weakness; that it was made when the subject was not only fresh but still an open wound. It was hard for Ford and his cast to be as objective and detached from the matter as great art often is, to find a way of dealing with the hard truth that the fight for the Philippines was not just a defeat but a useless one where PT-boats proved of minimal help. All the talk of duty gets frustrating when one thinks of the overwhelming futility behind it."They Were Expendable" best works as a requiem, speaking of loss and man's hope for nobility in the face of same. It reminds us of whatever bad turns fate has in store for us, we need to be strong and face them out with determination, not necessarily because it will do any good but because it is the best we can do.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>this is an unexpected treat especially if seen projected. one of the best combat films shot during world war two. Robert Montgomery and duke Morrison give memorable performances as PT boat captains doing battle in and around the former US colony known as the Philippine islands. rear screen projection is only reverted to, well, when there's a close shot of either the duke or bob. other than that, the boats and the camera are in the water. john ford produced this minor classic for MGM. as in all ford films there is a dance sequence. here it's shot in shadow time. very evocative. did Gregg Toland lens the picture?

		<fullReview>Great WW2 naval drama. Loosely based on the US defense of the Philippines during the first few months of the US's involvement in WW2. Examines a branch of the US Navy not often featured in movies - PT (Patrol Torpedo) boats. Quite gritty in its portrayal of the war in the Philippines, though the role of the PT boats is a touch overstated and over-glamorized. Solid direction by John Ford, as you would expect. Good action sequences and cinematography, especially for the time.John Wayne is his usual swaggering, gung-ho self in his role. Richard Montgomery got top billing and well-deserved it: solid, understated performance, especially when compared to Wayne's.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is fairly accurate for what happened back then. Robert Montgomery plays the PT boat commander and is an actual serviceman from the war. John Wayne is his exec, a little bit hyper and inexperienced. The Pt boats are used basically as messenger boats by the brass. they just don't understand how to use them properly. As the movie progresses the crew is eventually beached and must go their separate ways. They do try to get the boat fixed at a remote facility run by an old man. As the Japs close in you can hear some gunfire but don't see what happens. At the end John Wayne and Robert Montgomery both get out on the last plane out of the area because of their PT boat experiences.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the most underrated WWII movies of all time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a great character study of those who were basically in the wrong place at the wrong time. It's all about a PT Boat squadron in the South Pacific at the outbreak of WWII. John Wayne, Robert Montgomery and Donna Reed head a great cast in this moving drama. This is about what war can do to people lives, people like you and me and the drastic decisions that have to be made in order to survive. It's about the military chain of command and what it's like to be near the bottom of that chain. Finally it has everything to do with how terrible war is and the ultimate price that must be paid for freedom.The Duke, as always, leads the charge while Ward Bond and the usual John Wayne crew fill in the balance of the story. Then of course there is Donna Reed, the Duke's love interest. She is beautiful, strong willed and a reminder that even in war everyone is expendable.This is without a doubt a great movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Over-rated, but understandably so...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>...given the subject matter, as well as the overwhelming influence of the 45+ cohort voting on this site (many of them undoubtedly John Wayne fans), this somewhat turgid, fictionalized account of PT-boat action at Corregidor and the Bataan peninsula during the Japanese invasion of the Philippine Islands in late 1941 marked the first war drama directed by the inestimable John "The Grapes of Wrath" Ford, and the continuation of a long association with rising screen icon, John Wayne. Based on an account published mere months after the event, the screenplay by naval-aviator-turned-writer Frank "The Citadel" Wead (and apparently uncredited assistance from expatriate script-doctor Jan "The White Cliffs of Dover" Lustig) incorporates dialog wholesale from the source, hewing closely to the somewhat unhistorical record of the travails of PT Squadron 3, which after significant combat action eventually carried Douglas MacArthur to his escape rendezvous on Mindanao Island when the Allied defense of the P.I. finally collapsed."They Were Expendable" is notable for its relatively non-propagandistic approach (in part, no doubt, because victory in Europe had already been achieved during filming, and victory in the Pacific was foreseeable--though painfully so--and in fact had been achieved by the film's release date), as well as its somewhat melancholic depiction of a battle that the United States was inevitably forced to lose to fight another day. It helps that Wayne isn't the lead (naval veteran Robert "Private Lives" Montgomery had that honor), and that an utterly lovely Donna "The Picture of Dorian Gray" Reed did the heartstring-tugging. The ensemble support isn't too shabby, either, featuring the likes of a young Marshall "Daktari" Thompson, Cameron "The High Chaparral" Mitchell, and established character actors like Jack "Cat People" Holt and Ward "The Maltese Falcon" Bond. The cinematography from esteemed lensman Joseph H. "The Hunchback of Notre Dame" August keeps things dark and moody; sadly, this co-founder of the A.S.C. died a few years later.Quite watchable, though not nearly as good as better known Ford (or Wayne) productions, "They Were Expendable" remains one of the best (and last) wartime Hollywood releases.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>John Ford's They Were Expendable makes good use of John Wayne, Robert Montgomery, and Donna Reed in this World War II drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After so many years of reading about this fictionalized filmed account of the events of American sailors dealing with the invasion of Japanese forces in the Phillipine peninsula, I finally watched They Were Expendable on VHS today. With John Ford as director, we see a fine drama of the struggles after Pearl Harbor of the Navy men trying to stay one step ahead of what they referred to as the Japs during their maritime missions of battle. Robert Montgomery and John Wayne play the superior officers put in charge of many young men not quite trained for the enemy attacks though they pull ahead with their best foot forward, anyway. While quite serious, there are some subtle humorous touches not to mention a slightly touching romance between Wayne and Donna Reed as a nurse that effectively pulls at the heartstrings down to hearing Ward Bond and many of his shipmates sing in accompaniment while Ms. Reed, Wayne, and many of the officers have a quiet dinner in a tent. In fact, part of the time, I couldn't help thinking of a similar scene in my favorite movie-It's a Wonderful Life-when Bond also accompanied with Frank Faylen on the song "I Love You Truly" as Ms. Reed and Jimmy Stewart were kissing on their honeymoon! And the battle scenes were some of the most exciting at the time. So on that note, They Were Expendable comes highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Our job is to lay down that sacrifice".</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The six months following Pearl Harbor was a grim time for America and it's allies. The Japanese propaganda effort went into high gear, and a concerted push was made to conquer as much territory as possible moving South and East into the Pacific. Real life events were still fresh in the minds of war combatants John Ford and Robert Montgomery when this film was made, evidenced by how news of the day might have been hampered by the available technology. Squarehead Larsen (Harry Tenbrook) still had his sights on the Arizona sailing into view with the 'best cook stoves in the Navy' some time after that ship was destroyed on December 7th, 1941.Ever since I first became aware of this film a number of years ago, I've had some trouble reconciling my feelings with the title. "They Were Expendable" seems altogether too dismissive, as if human lives didn't matter all that much. It was that discomfort that led me to pursue this film through my local library system rather than waiting for it to show up on some cable channel. I've been placated somewhat by the explanation offered by the story, as exemplified in my summary line. There is always a greater good at issue, in this case, the outcome of a war in which freedom and liberty was at stake against the implacable might of Imperialist subjugation.Still, it doesn't make viewing any easier for those familiar with the history of World War II. Quite coincidentally, John Wayne appeared in another WWII film, 1949's "Sands of Iwo Jima" that might have put it even more bluntly. War is all about 'tradin' real estate for men'. Viewed in that way, one wonders why nations of the world never seem to 'get it', as in learning from the mistakes of history and it's despots.The sad fact of "They Were Expendable" was that America suffered even more excruciating defeat at the hands of the enemy than is imparted by the story. References to Bataan and Corregidor barely hint at the losses incurred during the first half of 1942, just before America took it to the Japanese for real at Midway Island just a short time later, thereby setting the stage for Japanese retreat. In some sense, watching today the movie fails to offer some of that historical perspective, even though it would have been fresh in the minds of theater goers in 1945.In final summation, I would have to argue the problem I have with most war movies, whatever the era and whatever the conflict. This movie would have, in the end, been just as effective without the inclusion of the sidebar romance between Lt. Rusty Ryan (Wayne) and nurse Lt. Sandy Davyss. Without diminishing the effectiveness of Donna Reed's portrayal, their brief interlude had nothing to do with the outcome of the picture. I just recently saw Reed in 1953's "From Here to Eternity", and that film had more to do with the human element of lives affected by war and it's consequences. In my estimation, films set during a particular historical conflict ought to take one approach or the other, but avoid combining the two.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a veteran and history buff, I've always felt this movie should be required viewing for middle/high school history classes. As a product of the aging Baby Boom years, it appears most younger Americans deem us as an invincible and all powerful nation. We are and have been for decades but even in the prewar 1930's we positioned ourselves for 6 to 12 months of heavy loses, questioning final victory against the Japanese. Never again let us be so confident of ourselves and our abilities as to enter a war as unprepared and untrained as we did World War I and II. If your not speaking German or Japanese, thank a veteran, possibly your grandfather.Read the original book to find how dark those days were.

		<shortDescription>historical undertones</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is probably as accurate a portrayal of a historical event as one is going to find about World War II in such proximity to the conclusion of the war just four months earlier than the release date. The events portrayed are not "history" in a strict sense. They do, however, create a historical frame in which drama can operate on a fairly logical platform relative to the event itself. The fall of the Phillippines is not in question, but the drama makes it more palatable. One therefore has a historical movie which becomes part of the record of human activity. "They Were Expendable" is part of this record, a record which has historical undertones that cannot be denied. One of the sad ones is that Phillippinos in their own country were employed as servants and cooks, as they were so used on navy ships. Also sad is the desperation of American soldiers and sailors who knew that defeat, and worst, was certain. The saddest is the realization that the perks of generalship allow that the general have his wife and companions take up space on the PT-boats fleeing the Japanese, especially when one wonders which of the 36,800 or so Phillippinos and Americans ended their lives on the Bataan death march for the private satisfaction of the commanding officers. John Ford seems to spend more time than one would judge necessary on that part of the evacuation to suggest that it is just a coincidental part of the historical record. This movie has no need to create Hollywood heroes, there were plenty in the real war. If there is a movie hero at all, it is the PT-boat: powerful, energetic, handsome, and exciting. The opening scene surrounds the boats in classic glory: flags unfurled, spray flying, and a symphonic rendering of "Anchors Aweigh." It's difficult to find a more dynamic scene than this even in this movie filled with dramatic events.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a fairly decent old war movie. I didn't think that there was that much interest in torpedo boats until later, with John Kennedy's history and the TV show with Ernest Borgnine. It does get the grittiness of war down pretty well, and the fact that all of those left in the Phillipines were in a desperate situation. Such as Donna Reed's character, Lieutenant Davis, whose prospects of surviving the war seemed grim. But then that was true of the men in the naval battalion as well. John Wayne, as usual, played John Wayne. Not that there's anything wrong with that. Robert Montgomery was good as well, along with some of the old character actors from that era.

		<fullReview>They Were Expendable opens on December 7th, 1941 and takes us through the opening of the Pacific leg of WWII (from the point of view of the U.S.). Most of the film takes place in the Philippines. Most of the major characters are sailors on P.T. boats, which the navy doesn't believe are going to be very useful. The film is handsomely produced, with some of the best battle scenes of its time (the boats take on destroyers and planes). The battles with the planes are spectacular and gripping. The film should be better than it is, but there are some major doldrums in its run. Unlike some of John Ford's better films, They Were Expendable is only sporadically great; several individual scenes are beautiful. John Wayne is great in it; it's definitely one of his best performances. Perhaps I might like it better if I watched it a second time; I had a long break in the middle, and that can always harm films. 8/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>WHATEVER the Studio, whatever the Genre; one will always be happy and fulfilled by the viewing of a John Ford Film. We have seen his work done at Paramount, 20th Century-Fox, RKO Radio, Universal, Warner Brothers and even Republic Pictures. Off hand, we can't think of any Pictures that he did over at the tiffany studio, Metro Goldwyn Mayer. None that is, except today's subject, the fine World War II Drama, THEY WERE EXPENDABLE (MGM, 1945).NOT only was it a rare appearance for "Pappy" Ford; but also one in which he brought his Cinematic Step-Son, John Wayne with him, for a rare appearance at MGM for the 'Duke'.COMING toward the end of the conflict and being released in December of 1945, a full four months after both VE Day and VJ Day; the picture benefited from the knowledge of actual occurrences in the Philippines during the dark, early days of the Conflict in the Pacific.ADDITIONALLY, co-starring with Mr. "Duke" Wayne was Robert Montgomery, a well established actor on stage long before becoming a Star on the Silver Screen. Appropriately, Mr. Montgomery had been a skipper of a PT Boat in the War; which puts him right up there with the likes of John F. Kennedy and his PT 109.SUPPORTING this pair of super luminaries was a great cast of players. None of us should be surprised as the most obvious hallmark of a John Ford picture is a magnificent assembly of talent top to bottom of the playbill. In good evidence in the film one will see: Donna Reed, Jack Holt, Ward Bond, Leon Ames, Marshall Thompson, Donald Curtis, Cameron Mitchell, Jeff York, Murray Alper, Charles Trowbridge, Blake Edwards, Louis Jean Heidt, Wallace Ford, Duke Green, Sammy Stein, Kermit Maynard, and a cast of thousands.THE story is a fictionalized account of the struggle of the Philippine Islands and its people as well as the United States' Forces stationed there before the attack on Pearl Harbor of December 7, 1941. (The Philippines were not yet independent from our control following the Spanish-American War. Complete Independence for the Filipinos came on July 4th of 1946.) IT is also the story of the PT Boat, a new and untried addition to the American Fleet at the beginning of the War. (Originally called something like Motorized Patrol or something. The name PT was settled on later; from the initials for Patrol Torpedo Boat).AS in any of John Ford's Films, true love a and appreciation for our American Freedoms and way of Life, as well as for the United States itself are clearly evident; although it is most usually implied in the passing and never stated explicitly.EVEN though the characters are fictional (except for folks like General Douglas MacArthur &amp; Company) the fiction is not to be classified as strict fiction as the incidents portrayed are all based on real occurrences.AS for a Rating, as a War Picture or as any General Category, we award this rare MGM, John Ford, John Wayne Wartime Drama the same designation of rank that General Doug MacArthur had. And that is ***** (That's 5 Stars, Schultz!) POODLE SCHNITZ!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the Year of Our Lord 1941, Lieutenant Robert Montgomery (as John "Brick" Brickley) mans a torpedo boat. He helps defend the Philippines from Japan, and is summoned to the Hawaiian islands after the Japanese attack the US base there, at Pearl Harbor. Junior grade Lieutenant John Wayne (as "Rusty" Ryan) is the most valuable player in Mr. Montgomery's crew. When a mishap lands Mr. Wayne in the hospital, he bides time with attractive nurse Donna Reed (as Sandy Davyss). Then, it's back to the Pacific...Montgomery and director John Ford had just returned from serving in the war, and are credited with their "U.S.N.R." (United States Navy Reserve) military title. Wayne conspicuously receives no military title; surprisingly, he wasn't a World War II fighter. "They Were Expendable" refers to the many who lost their lives fighting the Axis Japanese during WW II. Mr. Ford's film is respectful, reverent, and relatively realistic - but not very engrossing. Ms. Reed contributes an especially impressive dramatic performance.***** They Were Expendable (12/19/45) John Ford ~ Robert Montgomery, John Wayne, Donna Reed, Marshall Thompson</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good story, Bad screenplay, Terrible acting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While I appreciate the valiant true story on which this movie is based, I feel the on screen reproduction of this story was very poorly reproduced. There is basically no story line. The premise is that Navy hierarchy does not see any benefit to using PT boats and the crew goes out to sink ships to prove them wrong. This is basically the whole movie in a nutshell.But the really bad part about this movie is the acting. Robert Montgomery and Donna Reed's performance were expressionless reading of lines. Neither showed any emotion and maintained the same expression throughout the entire movie. John Wayne was much better, and World War II probably would have been lost without his heroics in all his war movies, but even his performance was not enough to save this movie.This movie was nominated for 2 Oscar's, which just blows me away. My only guess is that Hollywood was caught up in the war effort at the time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>not good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you lived through World War II, you may be so in tune with the overt sentimentality of this film that you won't notice, or care, how bad it is.Scene after scene of talk about battles almost always fail to lead to the battles themselves. Even the "climax" is a flat sequence with little visual interest and almost no suspense.Perhaps, in 1945 when this movie was made, audiences didn't want to see fight scenes that were remotely realistic. And I suspect that, because patriotism was running so high, it would have seemed in bad taste to depict any of the American soldiers in a negative light, even though this story is more or less about a conflict within the army over whether "speedboats" should be used to fire torpedos in battle.Still, those two factors in the movie's creation should have served as reasons not to make it, not excuses to make it badly.This movie is to World War II what Cider House Rules is to abortion. As a piece of art, it's terrible, but it was obviously made for people who are ready to praise any film that thematically reflects their own feelings.</fullReview>
